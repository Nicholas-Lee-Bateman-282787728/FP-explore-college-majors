3911730,5,B002DKGWUC,"If you love the strange films of the HOWLING series as much as I do then you are certain to be delighted by this collection of three sequels.  Parts 3, 5 and 6 are included in this collectors edition (you have to by part 4 seperately) and while they are not the best films in the series (1, 2 and 4) they are not the worst either (the disaster known as Howling 7: New Moon Rising).  The movies come in a very impressive tin case that features the new artwork for part 3.  The prints used for 3 and 6 are very good (although they are not anamorphic widescreen) and part 3 has a 5.1 soundtrack and theatrical trailer included.  The print for part 5 is grainy and has a considerable degree of scratching and debris but it is certainly watchable. 5 & 6 have stereo soundtracks.  Having loved this peculiar series for many years, it is incredible to find a handsome box set like this at last.  I'm glad somebody decided to do a little something special for these lesser known films in the series.  This is a great deal, very inexpensive and lots of fun.",1257206400,9,1048,4.289340101522843
3911731,4,B002DKGWUC,"The product description or this item says,

""HOWLING TRILOGY! 2 DVD COLLECTOR'S EDITION TIN! In this set, you will be spooked by three of the Howling Series, Volumes 3-5; The Marsupials, The Rebirth and The Freaks!""

The only problem is that it is not accurate.  The set actually includes Volume 3, 5 & 6.  'Volume III: The Marsupials' is on a single disk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Vol-3-The-Marsupials/dp/B000TLTCR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling, Vol. 3: The Marsupials</a>) and 'Volume V: The Rebirth' & 'Volume VI: The Freaks' are on a single disk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-5-and-6-The-Beast-Returns-V-The-Rebirth-VI-The-Freaks/dp/B000IJ79TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling 5 and 6 (The Beast Returns)-V: The Rebirth & VI: The Freaks</a>),  as well.

This is actually a good deal as buying them separately cost about $16, and the full retail price of this set is about $13, AND it includes a tin case for free.  So, if you need #3-6 like I did, then you probably won't be too upset when this shows up and has #6, and not #4.  You will come to the conclusion that this is actually a really good thing after you spend several minutes discovering that you can NOT buy a #6 from Amazon without it including a copy of #5.  So, if you are missing #3-6, just buy this set and a copy of #4 and problem solved.",1253923200,15,1434,5.571428571428571

3911751,3,B002DKGWUC,"If you are a fan of the Howling series, you probably already own these movies. For those who have not seen the many lesser sequels to Dante's excellent 1981 original, all I can say is, watch with caution. None of the films offered here are masterpieces (I would argue that Part V is as close as you're going to get to perfection in the series and even this sequel is far from perfect) and all suffer greatly from the typical elements that plague these types of productions, stiff acting, low budget, inferior effects work and sadly for a werewolf movie, really cheesy transformation scenes. The team for ""Howling V - The Rebirth"" were smart and decided not to visualize what they obviously didn't have the budget to produce.

Interestingly enough, this set excludes the fourth film in the series, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"", and goes from number III to V and VI. In my opinion, these 3 are the better sequels so it's only for the better. For those that would like to watch the awful chapter IV, can purchase it individually. It is recommended since movies this bad are sometimes very entertaining but be warned, it stinks. Now, moving on to the movies included on this DVD.

Be warned... this review may contain spoilers.

The Howling III: The Marsupials **

The second sequel in the series is a wild, sometimes amusing and totally obnoxious film that never takes itself seriously. The main character is the beautiful Jerboa, a marsupial werewolf (who appear to have evolved from the Thylacine) who flees her village and goes to the city where she is cast in a low-budget creature feature. Meanwhile an Australian anthropologist, who has archival film footage from the turn of the century depicting Australian Aborigines sacrificing and killing a werewolf, is convinced the world is being plagued by these hairy monsters. The plot is rather convoluted and although the sequel is amusing at times, it is not always successful as it suffers tremendously from its low budget and childish story. It tries to be creative during its many transformation scenes but they never quite turn out and the werewolves themselves looks rather silly and nowhere near as ferocious as those depicted in Dante's classic. Also, the film is too tongue and cheek so it is not scary in the least. There is no atmosphere, no sense of dread or fear. The original film used horror and humor splendidly while ""Howling III"" over-does it and is more of a parody than an actual horror movie. If you view this as campy entertainment, you may be entertained by it. Definitely do not view this expecting a horror film. If it's horror and shocks you want, you're better off watching a rerun of ""Roseanne"". It is definitely superior to the atrocious first sequel ""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" and the sequel that followed ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" but overall a very disappointing picture.

The Howling V - The Rebirth ***

This fifth entry is hands down the best sequel in the series. If you have seen parts II, III and the poorly done IV, do not expect to find that level of awfulness here as the makers of this film actually delivered in making a good, solid who-dun-it with a werewolf twist.

The film starts in medieval times as a mass murder/suicide is taking place. As the victims lay dying on the floor of their castle, a baby is heard crying in the background. Fast forward 500 years later and several established individuals (ranging from a doctor to a movie star) are summoned to attend the re-opening of a glorious castle in Budapest. At first, it is all fun and interesting conversations but it soon turns threatening when some of the guests begin disappearing and those remaining begin to suspect that something sinister is at play. When some of the victims are found with their throats ripped out, the mysterious Count who summoned them, reveals the dark history of the castle and the real reason for their gathering.

This nifty little shocker is devoid of intense gore and any werewolf transformation scenes but it is without a doubt, the best in the series besides the original. It is obviously a low budget production but the film team didn't have this hinder their imagination and went around their many obstacles and gave us much needed suspense, something terribly lacking in all of the sequels, a very chilling atmosphere, a good, creepy score, and they manage to squeeze some good performances from most of the cast. For the reviewers who criticize this entry for having bad performances must have not seen the previous (""Howling II"" and ""IV"") and later instalments (""Howling 7"" is awful on every level). Most of the actors in this sequel are pretty good in comparison and since there is much more character development here, we end up actually caring for some of these unfortunate souls. Many cite the lack of werewolves in the movie as its main problem. I personally do not think this is an issue at all. I would prefer seeing glimpses of the monster, it's claws, it's angry snarl, it's wicked eyes and in one scene, its hairy silhouette complete with elongated fingernails, than an atrocious B-movie monster in all of its low budget, laughable glory. What we do see of the creature, is good and at least ""The Rebirth"" cannot be criticized for displaying for prolonged periods of screen time an awful looking, rubber creature.

""Howling V: The Rebirth"" is not as good or as frightening as the original but in comparison to the other sequels, this one shines above them all as a solid piece that is generally well made with some great location shots, atmosphere, suspense and a rather peculiar, surprise ending. It is not perfect since the pacing is a bit slow and when scrutinized, plot holes are evident but these minor issues are easy to overlook when the rest of the sequels are so darn awful. This fifth entry holds up well and it deserves, at least, a view.

Howling VI: The Freaks **

After a good, solid entry with ""The Rebirth"", the franchise took another nose-dive with ""The Freaks"". Although it is not the worst of the sequels, again, I have to cite II, IV, and VII since they stand out in their awfulness, this entry is still disappointing. It lacks suspense and scares and although this one tries to resurrect the werewolf transformation scene, it does so unsuccessfully and the end result is a werewolf that simply looks like a very tall, ugly man with body hair issues.

The story centre's around Ian, a charming drifter who takes a job at a local church. This mysterious loner harbors a dark secret. You see, when the moon is full, he transforms in to a hairy sasquatch .. I mean werewolf. Meanwhile, a travelling carnival arrives in town and one of its showcases is its freak-show complete with an alligator boy, a he-she, a three armed man and a clown who likes to chew off the heads of chickens (didn't see that one coming). The owner of this freak-show is R.B. Harker, a tall, masculine blonde with a flowing mane that would look great in a Harlequin romance novel cover and who also has a dark secret of his own. It is revealed that he is a loathsome, evil vampire who unmercifully exploits the freaks he takes under his wing. Harker, who is aware of Ian's secret, and can initiate a transformation by simply chanting some words, uses Ian as part of his carnival freak-show display. The sasquatch, ... I mean ... the werewolf here is the good guy and the climax is a showdown between Good and Evil. The idea is an interesting one and ""Howling VI"" pre-dates the current batch of werewolf vs vampire themed films such as the ""Twilight"" and ""Underworld"" saga. I just wished this had a bigger budget so more could have been accomplished. ""The Freaks"" is ambitious but rather clumsy and there are far too many quirky characters that it becomes a bit tiresome. The transformation scene is better than previous and later sequels but where this one drops the ball is in the actual snout-less sasquatch... I mean, werewolf. At least give the beast a snout. This is not 1941. In this day and age, even by early 90's standards, we expect more from a cinematic werewolf than some contact lenses and glued on hair.

Although far from being the worst, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" will only amuse those undiscriminating horror fans with low expectations. Which is disappointing considering this had all of the potential of being a great entry in the series.

""Howling Trilogy - Triple Feature"" does not include any extras, not even the trailers. All you get are the movies and that's it so do not expect much. The quality of the films are very disappointing. The three movies show their age and unfortunately nothing was done to clean them up. This is especially true of the ""The Rebirth"". The transfer is sub-standard, looks grainy in several parts and the picture quality looks no better than the 20 year old VHS tape I originally had. For the price, I suggest you just get the DVD's since its several dollars cheaper, I wouldn't spend more than $10 on this release. The only one worthy of buying individually if it is ever released in a more comprehensive DVD or Blue-ray, is ""The Rebirth"" but I am not holding my breath. The others, view with caution, but they are certainly entertaining in their own, low budget, B-movie kind of way and you can do much, much worse. ""Howling VII: New Moon Rising"" for example, makes these 3 films look flawless in comparison.",1382313600,,9386,4.715243902439024
3911752,2,B002DKGWUC,"You get three Howling franchise films on a single disc. The Marsupials is weak but The Freaks and The Rebirth are good (both are considered the best sequels in the franchise). The Rebirth is an overlooked gem. It has great atmosphere, location and some good acting. Unfortunately it doesn't look great on Blu-ray because all of these films need to be remastered or at least retouched. If you are a Howling fan who hasn't seen the films in years then be warned they have aged and can no longer hide their weaknesses. Fans of the original can buy The Howling on Blu-ray also but I prefer The Rebirth now. This set is also available on DVD for half the price. Since the video and audio are little better than VHS you have to do your own research to decide what is right for you. A scary werewolf film has never been made. However, I did enjoy An American Werewolf in London for its humor. This blu-ray trilogy is rated a lowly 2.5 stars on Amazon. Howling, Howling V and VI would have made a better trilogy but the production values in this franchise are average overall (unless you think your sister is a werewolf). Howling II, IV, VII and VIII are even worse.",1377475200,,1158,4.44131455399061

3911756,2,B002DKGWUC,The picture on these movies is pretty bad. Ok these were all made to video movies from the 80's on very small budgets. But better prints existed and in no way should we have a pan and scan feature on here as part 3 was shot in widescreen.  These are cheesy c movies. but I like those types of movies. AND these films deserved a lot better than this. Still it's all we have. Howling one is coming out though on blu ray. which is great news.,1370563200,,439,4.045977011494253

3911758,2,B002DKGWUC,"Timeless Media Group usually does a decent job releasing some fairly interesting cut-rate DVD's. However, they definately need re-think their decision to start releasing titles in the Blu-ray format, as there's really nothing to add to the old video masters that make up most of their product.

A Howling fan from way back, I knew this would most likely be pretty bad, but decided to take a slim chance anyway. Needless to say, it was the first time I've ever encountered a Blu-ray that wasn't at least marginally better than the DVD.

I would suggest that one instead buy the widescreen Elite Entertainment disc of Howling III and the original (presumably out-of-print) Artisan double feature of Howling V and Howling VI. All three are, in terms of quality, way ahead of this drink coaster.",1301702400,14,791,4.895522388059701

3911760,1,B002DKGWUC,"Each of these three films has its charms, and all three are entertaining in the nutty ways they have nothing to do with each other and often try to avoid showing werewolves at all to save a buck. Unfortunately this, ahem, ""Blu-Ray"" is just a terrible port of the old VHS-era masters and actually looks even worse; Part V is so dark, soft, and murky you can't tell what's happening most of the time. To add insult to injury, Part III is pan and scan, while the Elite DVD is letterboxed (and 16x9).  If you have the DVDs (or even the VHS tapes), stick with those; there's no reason to pony up for this again.",1291161600,35,606,4.269565217391304

Part 4(separate order) is good while parts 1&2 are excellent. Part 7(separate order) is a Razzi award(awards for bad movies) nightmare. Part 7 is so bad I regret ordering it and I love vampire/werewolf movies. One thing about part 6 however that I find VERY interesting at the risk of a ""spoiler alert"" is that it is vampire(you read that right!) vs. werewolf way before Underworld was ever released.
