8514481,4,B007CEJD5K,"""Daddy Long Legs"" is a bittersweet Korean romance that had me in tears. Well, many Korean romance dramas reduce me to a crying mess, actually. They all have a way of inspiring strong emotions in the audience. In this 2005 tearjerker, Ha Ji-Won (she is a really good character actress) portrays Young Mi-Cha who discovers she has a mysterious benefactor who helps pay for her college education, and sends her meaningful gifts. Young graduates college and starts working at a radio station as a writer. Initially she faces strong opposition from her team, especially the female radio presenter who is resentful of Young's appointment to the job.

Not having a place to stay, Young is provided rent-free accommodation in a nice little house - Young attributes her good fortune to her benefactor, her ""Daddy-Long-Legs"". One day, Young receives an e-mail that was sent by the previous occupant of the house, and was meant to arrive a year later. The e-mail details a love affair that spanned several years, and inspired by the story, Young serializes the story, hoping to find the person the owner of the house was secretly in love with all those years. Then Young meets Kim Jun-Ho, a librarian at the radio station and the pair begin to fall in love.

When Young discovers that Kim was the young man in the letter, she decides to end their relationship but there's a shocking revelation that comes as a surprise not just to Young, but to the audience as well. The twist in this tearjerker is one that really kicked me in the gut, and it is a sad film, but well worth a watch for those of you who enjoy sappy, well-acted love stories.",1446854400,3,1629,4.672473867595818
