7794951,5,0980066441,"It's easy to see why this movie did well on the film festival circuit. It's funny, sexy, unforgettable and very provocative. The plot follows a young Nashville lawyer-turned-artist named Alex who is visited by the ghost of Judas. Alex photographs nudes and his gorgeous wife Julia is a terrific subject.
What mattered to me is the way this film explored the subject of betrayal as well as Alex's search for a ""meaningful"" life.
Although. like most indies, the acting is occasionally uneven, the overall film has a big impact.
This is a top notch independent film and well-worth the investment.",1296691200,,593,4.94
