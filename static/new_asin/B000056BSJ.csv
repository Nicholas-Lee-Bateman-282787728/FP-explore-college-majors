1396541,5,B000056BSJ,"This is a film that I enjoyed when I first saw it in the theatre and when it came out on video I  watched it enough to wear out my copy of the  tape.  I just hope and pray that this comes out on DVD some day so that I can  have a copy that I can not wear out.  These were characters that I truly  was able to ""relate to"" and characters that I truly cared about.  Leonard Maltin may not like it (two stars in one of his reviews is actually  pretty good, even some of the films he likes get only 3 stars from him),  but I do not think that Kasdan lost his ""edge"" at all.  This was  truly the ""Big Chill"" for my generation (I was 23 in 1991 when  ""Grand Canyon"" came out).
God bless,

1396542,5,B000056BSJ,"A powerful story of people people dealing with the usual and unusual events of everyday life. When at the start of the movie, Kevin Kline's car breaks down in a dangerous neighbourhood and a gang of youths surround him,  the audience expect the usual bland violence that recent Hollywood films  have made us expect. This time every event produces its own surprise. Mr.  Kasdan is a genius",912297600,3,388,4.7611940298507465
1396543,5,B000056BSJ,"Saw this movie years ago, but had a difficult time finding it until I searched Amazon.  Still love the story! Crash, Babel and Grand Canyon are all in the same vein.",1489363200,,165,4.32258064516129
1396544,5,B000056BSJ,"I watch and own a huge number of movies. Grand Canyon is a truly significant film. Of all the movies in my collection, it is among my top three favorites. I watch it around once a year. One reason why it is so important to me is that I have faced challenges for beyond what the average person might experience - being so far off trail in Africa that even my translator could not speak the local language, facing my own death more ways than I could count - typhoid, green mamba, firearms, and more. This kind of thing either makes you hard and cynical, or it puts you in a position where it seems like you are surrounded by a higher reality - something quiet, peaceful, and where perception is enhanced. Grand Canyon seems to explore this in some way; taking experiences that many Americans (and others) might experience and taking it to that higher level.
I can't say enough about this film, but I should mention that if someone is just looking for entertainment, this can only take you so far. If you are a person who has a bit of the spark that can take you a notch or two above a mundane existence, this film might speak to you. Again, it is among my top three all time favorites. I strongly recommend it.",1487635200,,1208,4.325991189427313

1396571,5,B000056BSJ,"I watched the movie with my mom on October 22nd 2011 and it was great. I bought my copy in a bookstore in New York. It was sitting in one of the shelves and it cost me $7 and my dad got it for me. I'm not such a big fan of dramas but I wanted to get this since the very beginning; just a few weeks after I came across Kevin (Kline). He's so handsome even when he was a youngster ascending to be a middle aged man. (Now he's near-elderly.) I even used to listen to the soundtrack when I go running. From seeing this, I now understand what it's like to live in LA. And in The January Man, I also understand what it's like to live in New York. And I also got this 2 weeks and a day after I met him. (I can't wait to see Kevin in the Beauty and the Beast live action remake.) When I read that Mack nearly got ran over by a bus, at first I pictured him standing in the middle of the road and someone would jump to catch him. Then I realized, he was about to cross the street and a stranger grabbed him by the back of the collar. Then he thanked the stranger wearing a baseball cap with his favorite childhood team. And I'm surprised it was taken by Larry (Kasdan)'s own life. Kasdan is one of my favorite directors. There are a bunch of movie directors I admire (even those who both act and direct like Sir Kenneth Branagh). At the time this movie was out on the big screen (limited on christmas day and a wide release on the 17th of January 1992), Kevin became a father for the first time; few months after Phoebe gave birth to Owen. (Owen is very handsome like his dad when he's a fully grown adult.)",1428710400,2,1597,3.99375

I only remember that the part I saw on tv was funny, so I bought this movie.  I must have been mistaken.  This movie was awful.  It kept bouncing around to different people's lives.  It wasn't funny.  In fact, we couldn't even finish watching it.  I think we might have hung in there for about an hour of it then shut it off.  It'll go to Goodwill.  Unless you like boring movies about too many people's lives, I wouldn't recommend it.",1426118400,,588,4.132743362831858
1396573,5,B000056BSJ,"Great movie in many ways. A metaphysical/spiritual thread runs though it.

1396590,5,B000056BSJ,".... and, slow moving, too.  But, I happen to like these types of movies, thus, my 5 - star rating.  It IS tough to sit through this movie without getting a little ""antsy"".... the movie should have been shortened - the director must have thought the public to be too dumb to
get the overall theme, so, he kept drumming it into the audience, repeatedly.  Then, in the final scene...at the GRAND CANYON... the
dialogue is  ""horrendous""  !!!  I know what the director was going for  ( a lack for words to describe what all of them were looking at )
, but,  ""So, whaddaya think  ?  It's not all that bad. ""  COME ON,  now - -  is that ... ""IT"".... ?!?!  LOL....ahahahahahah  !  If the vastness of the Grand Canyon was truly meant to display our own insignificance in the world, then, why did Kevin Kline utter so flippant a ""punch line"" to Danny Glover's question ?!?  ( btw....thought that KlLINE gave the ""worst ACTING performance"" in this movie....by far....of the main characters.  So, I guess,  K.K.  was a poor choice for THIS ""lead role"". )  Steve Martin played his part,
perfectly !  Danny Glover was, well, ""danny glover"".... nice guy - - mediocre actor.  ML Parker was second best (next to SM). Didn';t like the lady who played Kline's wife, at all...the two didn't seem like they would be married to one another.
Still, I LIKED the movie  - - -  just wish that ""I"" had ""directed"" it....that's all......Hahahahaha.....LoL  !  DW",1393545600,,1434,4.543307086614173

1396592,5,B000056BSJ,"Grand Canyon is a 1991 American drama feature film directed and co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and featuring an ensemble cast. About random events affecting a selection of diverse characters, the film explores the race- and class-imposed chasms which separate members of the same community. Grand Canyon was advertised as ""The Big Chill for the '90s"", in reference to an earlier Kasdan film.......
After attending a Lakers basketball game, an immigration lawyer named Mac (Kevin Kline) finds himself at the mercy of potential muggers when his car breaks down in a bad part of Los Angeles late at night. The muggers are talked out of their plans by Simon (Danny Glover), a tow truck driver who arrives just in time. Mac sets out to befriend Simon, despite their having nothing in common.........
In the meantime, Mac's wife Claire (Mary McDonnell) and his best friend Davis (Steve Martin) (a producer of violent action films) are experiencing life-changing events. Claire encounters an abandoned baby while jogging and becomes determined to adopt her. Davis suddenly becomes interested in philosophy rather than box-office profits after being shot in the leg by a man trying to steal his watch, vowing to devote the remainder of his career to eliminating violence from the cinema.
The film chronicles how these charactersas well as various acquaintances, co-workers and relativesare affected by their interactions in the light of life-changing events. In the end, they visit the Grand Canyon on a shared vacation trip, united in a place that is philosophically and actually ""bigger"" than all their little separate lives.",1390089600,4,1618,5.250965250965251

1396607,2,B000056BSJ,"When I watch a movie, I don't want to be thinking about the implied content of the dialogue, or the underlying meaning of the plot, or how the sound track does or doesn't add to the mood. I just want to watch the darn thing and get lost in whatever story is being told. This movie didn't allow me to get lost in it for one single second. Instead, it pointed to itself over and over again - look at how wonderful I am!

Well, it wasn't wonderful. The dialogue was painfully unnatural, designed to make a point rather than to let us see into the characters. The characters themselves were cardboard cutouts - the dissatisfied husband, the wife who can't let go of her son (although, she doesn't want to pick him up after school), the poor, but honorable, black people (absolutely essential if you want your movie to make a Point), rich, but clueless white people (also essential if you want your movie to make a Point), and everyone, of course, lives in LA, because it is impossible for any other city on earth to have poor people, rich people and dangerous thugs all in one place.

The only good thing about this film (aside from one line delivered, and probably written, by Steve Martin), was being able to look again at the young, beautiful faces of Alfre Woodard and Mary McDonnell, two of the finest actresses of our time. I feel like the Kasdans owe them (and Steve Martin, and Kevin Kline, and Danny Glover, etc, etc) an apology.",1347321600,2,1434,4.469465648854962

It's a simple, unpretentious, film which deals with a profound question: is life a string of unrelated chaotic events or is everything we encounter all a part of a bigger picture?  Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that the story is one about inintended epiphanies revealing the latter perspective.

1396610,4,B000056BSJ,"Grand Canyon is one of those movies that was not appreciated at first ,but years later after seeing in through fresh ( Older ) eyes I'm amazed at how relevant it is now. Instead of going through what it is about, simply I just want to say how it is a preclude to movies like Crash and The TV Series Touch. These are about chance encounters with people that have a ripple affect in ways we cannot predict.

The ensemble gels well together, but it is Danny Glover's and Kevin Kline's Characters that steer this boat and without it being over the top mushy, it simply gives us a view of how maybe we take chance encounters for granted.

I watched this today and was blown away, especially the scene in the Diner when Kevin Kline takes Danny Glover to Breakfast is so well done.

1396611,2,B000056BSJ,"It's almost laughable to me that people thought (or still think) that the screenplay for `Grand Canyon' was its best asset.  I mean, seriously, this is `Crash' level sized awfulness in a cup.  The clich&eacute;d themes and the preposterous overwrought-ness of the whole thing is enough to make you nauseous with stupidity.  There isn't a sincere note in the script, even though it tries really hard to make you think it is.  That is another problem, but the Ron Howard-esque schmaltzy saccharine sympathies lathered onto the main characters is just unflattering and really makes the audience (or at least me) cringe with discomfort.

Why are you trying so hard?

But alas, there is a redeeming factor here, and in keeping with my `Crash' comparison, it is the acting.  When it comes to ensemble performances, `Grand Canyon' hit a jackpot.  Nearly every player is giving it their all, and while they are left juggling some unwelcomed ridiculousness, they handle it with more class than it is worth.  Danny Glover is especially timely as the soft spoken yet firm tow-truck driver who is hesitant to accept that gratitude of Kevin Kline's character.  The way he delivers a subtle low-key performance is commendable considering that theatrical nature of the film itself.

There are a few films that have tackled this `interwoven' tapestry like way of storytelling, and I happen to like this type of film as a rule.  I appreciate Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu more than most, and we all know that Robert Altman might as well have invented this `genre' since he basically mastered it.  Sadly, Lawrence Kasdan doesn't weave this story in a way that feels compelling or even moving.

While I don't have as much distaste for it as I did back then, it still doesn't do much for me. As I often do, I read the positive reviews and the requisite negative comments to those who gave it one star to see if I missed something. It's always amusing to me how people chose the ridiculous and arrogant reply that someone ""doesn't get it"" if they happen to dislike a movie.  To that end, there is little to get about Grand Canyon. It certainly isn't subtle and neither is the smugness that runs throughout it. This is a rich white guy's movie version of Rodney King's plea for everyone to get along.

The character of Mack, a Wonder Bread Angelino if there ever was one, stands at the center of this movie because he has an encounter that jolts him out of his mid-life ennui, but he spends so much time wrestling with his inner motives that I'm never quite sure he has really made the transformation. Comically enough, the producer played by Steve Martin is arguably the most honest of them all, although an argument can be made for Danny Glover's Simon, the moral center of the movie. Both of these characters see the folly in looking inward to the point of being blind to everything around you.

Kevin Kline's Mack agonizes over his lost opportunity to pay it forward and then wrings his hands over the choices he makes to finally rectify this colossal life crisis. It's a grandiose and eager-to-a-fault premise that simply didn't work for me, possibly because Mack is a largely unlikable person. He cheats on his wife but then has a change of heart and simply wants to pretend nothing happened. The girl he fooled around with (played by Mary-Louise Parker) is suffering from heartbreak and the feeling of being used, exacerbated by the fact that Mack is her boss, yet Mack can't seem to understand why she wants to quit. Even though she tries to explain, the point is lost on him. Just how aware is this guy? He wants to save Simon (who clearly doesn't need saved at all) but can't see the problems with his secretary or even empathize with his wife's desire to adopt an abandoned baby. Mack wants to help but in a narcissistic way - he wants to clear his conscience and feel good about himself and seems oblivious to everyone around him. I'm never convinced his motives are greater than his own self-satisfaction.

Mack is a weak person trying to make a difference in the world yet by-passing the most obvious places to start. In short, there is no need to have Parker's character in the movie at all because Kasdan choses to do nothing with her and, worse yet, make her seem unstable and pathetic. It's more important that angsty Mack fix up his newfound black friend with a date than address the far-more pressing issues staring him in the face. In the end, all's well that ends well and the credits roll as all the happy people stare in awe at the Grand Canyon.

Grand Canyon is a lightweight social commentary that plays more like a feel-good movie than a powerful observation (e.g. ""Crash""). There are some decent scenes but it says very little in the final analysis. It's a movie that seems to not fully understand the tragic joke in Martin's comment that all of life's answers are found in the movies; as if Kasdan wants us to believe he's being ironic when in fact he was being serious.",1339632000,3,3386,4.526143790849673
1396613,4,B000056BSJ,"This is a very good movie. It's got heart. Kevin Kline plays a lawyer whose car breaks down in a bad neighborhood in LA. Danny Glover plays the tow-truck driver who rescues him. Steve Martin is his film producer friend who gets shot and decides to stop making the sleazy violent movies he's been making. We follow their stories separately and as they interact, in a montage that seems to have one great point to make. Just to prove it, this is the last line of the film: ""It's not all bad.""

People have troubles, even bad troubles, but they also get lucky, sometimes in a sort of supernatural way. Kline's wife finds an abandoned baby in the park while she's running for exercise. She hands it over to the authorities, but begins procedures to adopt the adorable little girl. She jogs by a scruffy long-hair one day and gets frightened, finds him threatening. A couple days later, he walks past her and says ""Keep the kid. You need her as much as she needs you.""

She has very few doubts, but Kline has more. Martin talks about it with him on the way home from the hospital, and talks about all the bad things like smelly diapers and not getting enough sleep. Then Martin's girlfriend starts to cry because she wants kids and figures they are never going to get married and have children, and Martin says ""Who says we aren't?""

Coincidences happen; people do things that have major impact on someone else's life. Question is, are these miracles? As Kline's wife points out, ""Maybe we don't have enough experience with miracles so we don't recognize them when they happen."" And maybe there really is magic in love, in friendship, in people being good to one another.

The relationship to the Grand Canyon comes right at the end, when Glover drives Kline and his family, Glover's sister and nephew, and his new girlfriend (introduced by Kline) to the Grand Canyon. But they had talked about it before; it was a symbol, a metaphor for them. Something so big and so long in the making, and still being carved out by the river even today. The canyon symbolizes the gulf between the haves and have-nots to Martin. And so Kline sums it up: ""It's not all bad.""

A hard movie to explain, but a great one to watch, for all it is bloody in spots. This is, after all, LA, and some of the scenes are in the ghetto, and some are in Martin's gory movies.",1337385600,,2340,4.483568075117371

1396615,5,B000056BSJ,"First, I don't claim to be a true film critic.  If you're looking for a in-depth review where each character's role is discussed, I left that to the experts.  I'm reviewing it because I'm motivated to share how I feel about it.  I was just sitting reading the paper on a rainy Sunday afternoon when I switched to the Encore channel on TV.  Grand Canyon was set to air.  Since Kevin Kline and Steve Martin happen to be two of my favorite actors and the title intrigued me--a comedy, perhaps, I decided to watch.  I'm glad I did.

Whatever motivates some viewers to pan this movie surely is an alien feeling to me.  There's so much about this film that defies description--you have to ""feel"" it, you have to allow yourself to absorb each of the stories, place yourself in each of the characters' shoes and understand that this is life in all its raw, jaw-shattering reality.  I can't believe I missed this film when it first came out.  Perhaps I would have felt then as others do now but with the passing of time and my many experiences, the world's experiences, this is one unforgettable, meaningful film.  In some respects the underlying theme reminds me of Thoreau's quote:  ""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to their graves with the song still in them"".  This is a story of people who found the song.

Give yourself a chance.  Watch it.  You may begin to reflect on your life and look forward to the time you hopefully have left with new meaning and appreciation. Things that were once important to you may take a back seat and things that should have mattered more will.

I certainly look forward to what Kasdan creates in the future.  He's a genius.

1396622,5,B000056BSJ,"The people who are blasting this film in their reviews as being pretentious are missing the whole point. The specific events in the movie are just examples - the movie is about the fact that all of us have opportunities presented to us all the time, and we can either grab them or let them pass by. The scene where Kevin Kline is teaching his son to make a left-hand turn in LA traffic is an in-your-face metaphor for this whole theme.

The Mary-Louise Parker character's story is an illustration of the flip side - she gets stopped by a cute, sympathetic cop, and our collective knowledge of movie romance says this is it, he's the perfect guy for her, but she fumbles the ball and lets the opportunity pass without grabbing it (or even recognizing that it's happening).

Don't get too caught up by whether the events in the movie seem 100% realistic (it is only a movie, after all) - just let the movie inspire you to think about the opportunities that come and go in your own life, and how the choices you make about them affect subsequent events in your life.",1252195200,,1063,4.446153846153846

Lawrence Kasdan tries to make sense of the world in a way that leaves you thinking for months after watching this movie.  I originally saw this movie in the theaters when it was first released and it still, possibly more so, makes its point about all humans and their actions being intertwined with each other and how much we have in common is as important as our differences between one another.

1396626,5,B000056BSJ,"I watched this movie without reading the reviews beforehand.  I was interested to see what was written about the movie afterwards, so here I am.  I won't go into rehashing the plot of the movie; but would like to touch on one theme I feel is missing in most, if not all, reviews.

What we do in our life affects others; our choices and turn of events within our life has something to do with the contact and interaction of those around us, along with life experiences.  Each person on the face of this earth contributes in some way, no matter how slightly, to shaping the lives of those they come in contact with, whether it be insignificantly or very involved.

The Grand Canyon is a wonderful symbol of this theme.  We as a society are ever changing and evolving; there is erosion going on within our society (this seems to be obvious to all); however, for as different and separate we see each other, we are all part of something very large and beautiful, and that is what holds us all together.

I recommend this movie to families, especially families with teens.  Discussion should follow afterwards about what each feels they got from this movie; and about how important each and every person is... we all matter.  We all have the responsibility to understand that what we do, no matter how insignificant we feel the action, affects life and people around us.",1208131200,3,1365,4.584362139917696
1396627,5,B000056BSJ,"I was blown away the first time I saw this film.  The Grand Canyon is a metaphor for the alienation between different groups of people (ranging from married couples who have grown apart from one another to racial and socioeconomic divisions in larger society).  This movie creates a little magic in the bridge-building possibilities, and sends a message of hope.  One subtle note is that in various outdoor scenes in the movie, you will hear birds singing in the background.  One of the recurring bird songs is that of the Canyon Wren, a lovely series of cascading trills that is recognizable to anyone familiar with it's song.  It is a movie with a timeless spiritual theme about alienation, redemption and loving one another across the chasms that tend to divide us.  There are great performances by Danny Glover, Steve Martin, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell.",1202169600,3,876,4.925170068027211
1396628,5,B000056BSJ,This is an excellent movie about life. It is a movie that everyone should see. It is a real life scenario of the ups and downs of everyday people. It is a movie that once seen can inspire people to open their eyes and that random acts of kindness can go a long way.,1190419200,2,265,3.925925925925926
1396629,5,B000056BSJ,"""Grand Canyon"" (1991) is essentially about the 'grand canyon' that exists between the races and the haves & have-nots in America. It starts out powerfully with middle-aged lawyer Kevin Kline taking an unwise detour in L.A. and breaking down on the bad side of town; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the lives of those connected to them.

One subplot involves Kline's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are experiencing the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential ""other woman"" (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office at work and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Kline to have feelings for this woman? And, if so, should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?

That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare, like maybe ""RV"" (giggle).

Anyway, some themes explored include:

- Miraculous life-saving encounters.
- White/black relations.
- The rich/working class/poor divide.
- Homelessness.
- Why do kids join gangs/become hoodlums?
- The challenges of a 20-year nigh romance-less marriage.
- The drive to improve one's living standards.
- Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society? Does a filmmaker have a moral responsibility to society?
- Life-changing experiences that aren't so life-changing after all.
- How many split seconds do you have to make a left turn in downtown traffic?
- What do you do after miraculously finding/saving an infant?
- Divine intervention.
- Matchmaking, blind dates and finding Mr. or Ms. ""right.""
- The ripple-effect each person's actions have on others, revealing humanity's significance, which is contrasted by the idea that humanity is inconsequential compared to the Earth & universe's timeless marvels, like the Grand Canyon itself.

The picture obviously bites off a lot, but is well able to chew it. It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teenager's driving lesson: He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be Steve Martin's beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger): She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be McDonnell's reaction when her son asks if she and Kline are getting a divorce. Completely shocked, she asks, ""Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce?"" She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.

I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on quite a few occasions. The film delivers in this department. Plus it's realistic humor, not contrived.

Scanning through the reviews you'll note that ""Grand Canyon"" is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that ""Grand Canyon"" is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end! Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin, who has a beard and plays a filmmaker. These people need to get a life; Martin was perfect for the role.

A couple things I appreciate about ""Grand Canyon"" is that it respects the intelligence of the viewer; it's not dumbed-down, nor is everything spelled out. Some things you simply have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for DAYS afterward. Few movies have this effect. In fact, there's so much to ""Grand Canyon"" that you'll get something new from the picture with each viewing.

Oh, about the New York Times critic that lambasted ""Grand Canyon"" as the worst movie ever made (Why sure!): First of all, who cares what some moron at the NY Times says? The very fact that he writes for The Times tells you that his artistic judgment shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Also, most critics hailed 2004's ""Crash"" as a masterpiece but it obviously borrowed much from ""Grand Canyon."" The difference is that the latter is the better film. Although ""Crash"" has its merits ""Grand Canyon"" is more entertaining and has a more positive vibe.

FINAL WORD: ""Grand Canyon"" is a film of the most eminent order; a masterpiece.

I don't agree with those who have rated this film poorly.  I enjoyed the deep emotion displayed in this film by the cast, who I might add, were excellent in their roles.  This story takes place in Los Angeles and has many similarities to ""Crash"", as it deals with issues of race and prejudices.  I believe this film was fairly innovative in 1991, which might be the reason it was not well received. The story does have weeknesses in the fact that I was constantly expecting something bad to happen and then all worked out at the last minute before impending disaster.  In Crash, the bad things happen which gives that story more depth and tears at your emotions.  This film deals with issues that most of us can relate to.  That being, we don't always take the time to really explore our feelings and emotions. We don't always take time to explore how our actions affect those people we love or care for.

Aside from the fact that the New York Times may have awarded this the ""worst film of all time"" (in a year that ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"" was released?? - please!) I find these attitude of such reviewers quite lamentable.  Grand Canyon is a magnificent film - and absolutlely NOT just the purview of ""New Agers""!  Anyone who has studied film to even a marginal degree will recognise the greatness in Grand Canyon. No, it's not ""The Godfather""... yet it is still one of the finest films of its time.  To those it touches (and there are many), it is unforgettable.

Kasdan had a vision that was unfortunately ahead of its time (and still appears to be in 2006, judging from some of the reviews here!).  Certainly not ""The Big Chill"", Grand Canyon is a far more nuanced work - to those who understand its subtleties, it is sublime - to those still struggling to comprehend the mysteries, magic and meaning of our existance here, I can see how it might appear impenetrable or pretentious.  That is no fault of the film itself - just as ""Deuce Bigalow"" is speaking to its chosen audience of prepubertal adolescents, so is Grand Canyon attempting to connect with those humans who choose to delve beneath the flimsy facade of modern existance. To the opinion-makers, it will naturally slip under their radar; don't let that be a reason for you missing this unmissable film.

To anyone considering this film, I implore you - do not be distracted by the inane ramblings of posters who wouldn't understand a truly meaningful film if they fell over it.  Grand Canyon is for a select audience - it will never be widely popular; as if that were any true marker of what is important!  Grand Canyon stands tall as one of the great achievements of the 1990s - watch it, and be moved.  Watch it, and see a reflection of the world we currently find ourselves in - striving for answers, yearning for meaning... and looking all the while for the magic that defines our existance.

It was really panned by NYT and a whole host of others but there's a message here that we missed then and now, thirteen years later, is significantly more important.

I teach a Leadership class at a local college and I show the first 20 minutes of Grand Canyon just for the scene with Simon arriving on the darkened streets of West Inglewood. You know the one I mean. ""Are you the one I should be talking to?""

I think Kasdan was speaking from his heart sort of like Davis after he is shot. We need to take a stand. Simon says to the gangbangers, ""you may not know this but things aren't supposed to be this hard."" And Claire says to Mack, "" . .  maybe this is your miracle.""

We pass eachother on the street and have a chance to deliver random acts of kindness and mercy. Often instead we take the route that will give us the most ""feel"" and the most bang for our buck.

1396638,5,B000056BSJ,"I saw this film at a local cineplex when it was first released and since then, I've revisited ""Grand Canyon"" at least a dozen times.  Here are a ten observations:

1.  This film's theatrical release took place around the time that the Rodney King trial was getting underway, and the ensuing LA riots would take place some months later.  It's interesting how the underlying theme of ""Grand Canyon"" preceeded the ""Can't we all just get along,"" thrust of King's later remark to the news media in the wake of the riots.

2.  Kevin Kline does a good job of portraying an immigration lawyer who is having an affair with his secretary; Danny Glover and Mary McDonnell are okay in portraying a tow truck driver and a modern LA mom, respectively; and probably because he had nothing to do with the producing, directing or writing involved in this film, his role in ""Grand Canyon"" happens to be one of Steve Martin's better performances.

3.  The only special effects in this movie are in a dream sequence of Kevin Kline flying through the night air in metropolitan Los Angeles.  Otherwise, there are no car explosions, flying monkeys, no interglactic arks transporting shipments of minerals through deep space, no aliens blowing holes through buildings, and no Whoopie Goldberg.

4.  One element missing in the movie is humor.  Aside from Glover's remark that the Kline character may not know many black people, there really isn't much to laugh or even smile about; this lack of humor alone seems to make the characters less human and more like puppets in some morality play about undesirable behavior and human nature that plods along slowly, but methodically.

5.  Everything got thrown into this movie except the kitchen sink.  I suppose the whole concept of all these significant events (a rescue from would-be muggers in a bad part of LA, finding an abandoned baby, being shot by a gunman at close range, etc.) happening all at once may have looked good on paper, but in transition to film, I found myself thinking how implausible such an unrelated chain of events happening to a few people within a few hours would be.

6.  The thought that everyone should get together and that miracles really can happen are fine sentiments, but halfway through ""Grand Canyon,"" I was wondering what Kadsan was going to throw in for a Grand Finale:  The Kline Character discovers a body buried in his backyard?  The Glover character dies in a bar fight?  The Mary McDonnell character turns lesbo?  Kenny Rogers buys vast tracts of Brentwood in order to build an amusement park/dude ranch?

7.  At the very end of the film, everybody piles in a van and they all drive to the Grand Canyon, where they gaze in dumbfoundedness at this awesome natural wonder.  I guess if this movie had been written by Callie Khouri (Thelma and Louise) Kevin Kline would have driven the van off a cliff...  I guess Kasdan must have decided against this sort of ending because he couldn't find enough room to put Ridley Scott in the van.

8.  Probably because the white Ford Bronco didn't even exist at that time, no mention is ever made of O.J. Simpson.  At the time this film was being developed, O.J. was still being filmed running through airports with old ladies and business suits cheering him on.  Clearly, I was disappointed that some featurette including vignettes of O.J.'s struggles wasn't included on the dvd, because witnessing the O.J. trial was a lot like experiencing a vast cultural divide for us working stiffs.

9.  On the dvd that I bought, you have to fast-forward through all of this crap to get to the main menu.  I hope someday that the idiots who direct the manufacturing of these things realize how much they are pissing people off by doing this.

10.  Despite many of the above observations, the dvd film version of ""Grand Canyon"" is excellent.  ""Grand Canyon"" has a lot going for it, or else I wouldn't have given it five stars.  Great Cinematography.  Great Soundtrack.  Excellent casting.  I certainly enjoyed it, even though the actual story line was slightly weak.",1103068800,8,4055,4.771551724137931

1396644,5,B000056BSJ,""" Grand Canyon "" came out at about same time, as"" Parenthood ""
and "" Short Cuts "". All 3 movies deserves solid 5 stars . All 3 has wide variety of exellent actors . All 3 gives us story of very different people living in one city , but somehow connected to each other .
  From my point of view , this film is about luck ... is it luck or may be , just may be , it is small miracles , happen every day ?
  It is a story of Mac ( Kevin Kline ), emigration lower in LA , and people around him . People , who effect his life , and same people who's life he changes . Doesn't matter , if he wants to do so , or he doesn't .
 Movie starts with the Laker's game . We se Steve Martin(Davis)on the floor court . Of cause we think , that he is a main character in the movie ( but in reality - he is only supporting actor ). We already know - this guy is Somebody ( floor court , Laker's game ?! ). But then , we se Kevin Kline with him and slowly acsent moves to his character , Mac . On the way home ,  he makes the wrong turn to avoid aftergame traffic . Bad decision . His car died in the wrong neighborhood . Mac in troubles , but towtruck driver shows up and , probably , saves his life . This is how we meet Simon ( Danny Glover ).
1. The story of Mac...
 We like this guy . He is honest , likeble person . He is not just floating in the river . He is trying to change something ... for better . Only in the middle of the movie we found out WHY !? He tells this story to Simon ... He was standing on the curb ... and made a first step ... the stranger's hand grab him and pulled back , a split second before the bus pass by ... All he was able to say : Thank you ... and the stranger ? "" My pleasure ""... ""She was wearing Pitsburg Pirates cap !? My favorite team since I was a kid - Mac said - was it LUCK ???Or something else ? He is trying to help Simon , the guy who saved him ones . He loves his wife and son . He is doing so many things right , but later we realise - it is not about him . It is about people around him .And no matter what you do , somebody will get hurt .
2. Story of his family ...
 His wife is missing her son ( he left to the summer camp ). He grow up so fast ?! She has so much emptyness now .
 His son ? We like him right away .
3. Story of Mac's friend , Davis...
Big time movie producer . Violent movies . This is his world . "" I made more money this year , than my father in all his life""- he says . This is his Value ?! We think , he is going to change , after getting shot in the bright day lite in the middle of LA ?! This is what he said ... but nothing changes . He leaves us with his thouts , that his "" art "" reflect what is going on ??? And a HUGE studio door opens , he walks in and the door closes ... slowly . He looked so small ...
3. The story of Simon ...
I think , he is in reality the main character in this film . His wife left him ( but he is peacefull about it ). His deff daughter is in DC , and he speaks with her on one of those TDD machines . If Mac is just likable guy , Simon is smart from his life experience . We want to hear , what he has to say . I just cann't forget his words : My father died last year ... he was 81...very long time for a black man ... in this town . And story of his sister's family showes it well anouph . Remember , what spanish kids said , after they mooved ? Where he came from ? Beirut , or something ?
PS:It is so easy to say : I have a message to deliver , and I am going to do it ! But in reality , the question is : Do you really have anything to say ? Anything to say , what important to us ? Are we going to hear it?
 This movie defenetly has a message ! I am so sorry , that some of us didn't get it . This is only a movie ! And people in it are only the actors . Look around . You'll se the real people ... and may be YOU can do a little miracle for them ?",1032134400,14,3846,3.482476635514019
1396645,5,B000056BSJ,"Early in this film one of the characters makes the observation that half of the people in the city of Los Angeles (in which the story is set) live every day on the verge of hysteria.  It is further noted that the other half ARE hysterical, and the predominant aspect of their lives is attempting to control their constant fear; fear generated entirely by the very nature of their environment, and just the way things ""are.""  It's a thought provoking concept of life in the `90s and beyond, and of a world in which babies are abandoned, people live in boxes on the street and the guy with the gun is in charge.  And as another character so succinctly points out, ""This isn't the way the world is supposed to work--""  All of which and more is considered by director Lawrence Kasdan in his evocative drama ""Grand Canyon,"" starring Danny Glover, Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell.  It's a contemplation of the kind of world in which we are forced to live, the huge gaps and voids it creates in our lives, and the decisions and choices we make in an effort to fill the crevasses it all forms in our souls.  This is more than just a film, it's a statement; a reflection upon what it takes for millions of people from all walks of life to get out of bed every morning and face the day.  And for those who care enough and are bold enough to look deeply into Kasdan's eyes, there's a message to be found here, and a powerful one it is.
In the song ""Johnny 99,"" Bruce Springsteen sings about a part of town where ""When you hit a red light you don't stop,"" and when Mack (Kline) leaves a Laker's game at the Forum and decides to try a short cut to avoid traffic, it is precisely in ""that"" part of town that his car gives up the ghost.  His cell phone is dead, but he manages to find a phone booth and call for road service.  But just as he gets back to his car, he becomes the target of a gang of armed young hoodlums out for an easy score or possibly more.  And when things are looking about as bad as they can for Mack, the tow truck arrives, and out steps a man named Simon (Glover), who thankfully knows a thing or two about negotiating with gang members; after all, this is his turf-- where he lives and makes his living.  Simon takes Mack out of harms way, and it is at that auspicious moment that a convergence of two heretofore divergent worlds occurs.
Mack is an immigration lawyer who lives and works within the environs of the Miracle Mile; Simon is a part of the town in Springsteen's song.  Two individuals from different worlds whom fate brings together for a split second; and It's a moment that is destined to change both their lives forever, and like ripples issuing from a stone dropped into a pond, it is soon going to touch and make a difference in many other lives, as well.  Mack and Simon are about to learn a few things from one another, the most important of which may be found in Simon's perspective of the human race, and the significance of ""people"" when compared to one of Eternity's masterworks, the Grand Canyon.
Lawrence Kasdan and Meg Kasdan wrote the screenplay for this film, from which Mr. Kasdan proceeds to deliver one of his finest cinematic offerings.  As previously stated, this is more than a film; it's a contemplation of who we are and what we have become as a species during our time upon this planet, and where it's all taken us.  And under Kasdan's steady guidance and insightful gaze, it is truly riveting drama that works especially well because there is something in it to which everyone will be able to identify or relate.  Certainly it will strike a deeper chord with those who live or have spent time in a large metropolitan area; the situations in this film will resonate much more for someone who has lived in L.A., as opposed to those born and raised in Independence, Oregon, for example.  But all will find a connection with the human issues Kasdan so incisively examines, because they are universal in nature.  Quite simply, Kasdan hits a perfect pitch here.  This is emotionally involving drama from beginning to end, aided in no small part by the mesmerizing score by Bill Conti and James Newton Howard that serves as a veritable pulse for the entire film.
The outstanding ensemble cast matches Kasdan's excellence with a number of unforgettable performances, beginning with Kline and Glover.  Kline gives the kind of performance we've come to expect from him, which is to say convincing, believable and entirely credible.  He explores all of the nooks and crannies of his character and concisely expresses all that he finds there.  Glover, too, hits his stride perfectly, making Simon genuine and real by finding his character's center and effectively maintaining his focus on it.
It is Mary McDonnell, however, who nearly steals the show with her portrayal of Claire, Mack's wife.  This is an extremely complex character, and McDonnell manages to thoroughly examine all of her myriad emotional levels and express them convincingly.  This is a woman at a most fragile time of her life, with the concerns of being a loving, devoted wife in conflict with her more maternal nature; coping with the sense of loss associated with the fact that her only child, Roberto (Jeremy Sisto) is fifteen and growing up too fast, and seeking to satisfy her need to nurture.  In Claire, McDonnell creates a woman with an absolute aura of beauty about her; it's a brilliant performance that is the very heart of the film.
And finally, Steve Martin (Davis), Mary-Louise Parker (Dee) and Alfre Woodard (Jane) take ""Grand Canyon"" to the zenith of cinematic accomplishment.",1031702400,39,5598,4.5907723169508525

Well, here we are ten years laater watching this well crafted movie, surrounded by even more cosmic madness than ever before.  A lot of contemporary prophecy films such as this need to be more widely viewed if we as a culture, as a world, are to survive.  Living in this tenuous time where most fingers are on triggers, whether they be personal guns or national weapons, private or public disasters, or just on the thin strings that contain sanity - now more than ever we can benefit from films such as this.  Caring, finding solace in acts of kindness shared at times of direst need, and yes, even putting it all in perspective by returning to the natural positive phenomena such as the Grand Canyon seems like our only  reliable way of making it. This Kasdan film has more fine performances (Kevin Klein, Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodward, Danny Golover, Jeremy Sisto, etc etc etc) and drives relentlessly to a final ending of such beauty that even ten years later we can only say ""Thank you "" to Kasdan and crew.",1023667200,68,1308,4.640692640692641

1396649,3,B000056BSJ,"I watched this movie last night. I found it be very interesting, nothing out of this world, but I was impressed by some of the social statements made, like danny Glover when he talks to his nephew about being good out on the street, and he tells him ""what are you going to come up with some great idea to clean up the streets that no one else has thought of"". The  central thought of this movie is that the world is chaos, that really we don't have any control, even though we'd like to think we do.

I heartily agree with all the comments of the reviewers above who rated this flick positively.

As for the folks who didn't like this flick, I believe they just don't have the frontal lobe capacity to understand it.  One guy criticized the movie here because it was set in Los Angeles.??????  Woooosh! {flying over his head....duhhhhhhhh ]  He missed the point of the movie for sure.  The setting in LOS ANGELES was deliberate you moron!

URBAN EXISTENTIAL ANGST, SPIRITUAL HEALING AND HOW TO BE HUMAN:

The redeeming quality of this flick is how people came together for each other when all the odds were against that happening. All the characters are HUMAN and wounded in some way.  This is not a super hero movie folks.

SAMPLE DIALOGUE:

Mary Louis Parker's character , an office aide:  ""Jane,? [to Alfre Woodard at the lunch table] do you ever feel like your just this far away [ gesturing with a thumb and forefinger very close to touching but not] from being completely hysterical 24 hours a day?""

JANE:  (Alfre Woodard) :  ""Half the people I know feel that way.  The LUCKY ones feel that way.  The rest of the people ARE hysterical 24 hours a day"".....  a succinct but poignant characterization of American life here to my mind....

~~~~~~~~~~~  ok the bad reviewers here might think this is bad dialogue, but I maintain that the Kasdans who wrote this are making some very insightful commentary on our society today.

MORE DIALOGUE:

SIMON( Danny Glover) speaking to his nephew OTIS:  ""  [do] You wanna be a gang banger when you're 25 [years old]??

OTIS [ Glover's nephew]  "" Sheeeet, [s**t] I'll never live to be 25 [years old]....

ok ok, INANE DIALOGUE, Laughable?  maybe to some, but the sadness and irony of a young capable teenager believing he won't live until age 25 strikes me as pretty poignant AND a social commentary on life in the USA for a black urban teenager.

For me, it was NOT a movie about racism. It is a movie about synchronicity (see the book ""The Celestine Prophecy"") for a story about synchronicity. Things happen = happenstance, random, coincidence, serendipitous......

Danny Glover's performance in this movie was powerful! I really loved his character and all the scenes he is in. He takes care of his sister, niece and nephew while he chats on a deaf enabled telephone to his deaf daughter who lives in Washington D.C. Technologically, a precursor look at Instant Messaging circa 1990
that people who are deaf used with a phone and a modem.

So, even though Simon is a tow truck driver, he uses this technology in his home to be a father to his daughter. He helps Mack, Kevin Kline's character and Mack and Simon develop a friendship. I found this a very realistic theme. I have had similar experiences.

The actress who played Simon's sister was dynamite as she portrayed her sheer terror, panic and hysteria as her humble home is riddled with gang's automatic weapons bullets. Her performance is of academy award caliber as is Danny Glover's. The little girl who plays her daughter surviving automatic weapon fire into their home is incredible.  The day after the shooting of their home, Danny Glover is putting plywood up over the shot out windows while his sister sweeps up glass.  The little girl is out in yard playing with the FRICKIN' CRIME SCENE YELLOW TAPE like she is at a Maypole dance or at a Birthday Party playing with the crepe paper.  The irony is subtle maybe for some, but powerful.

Alfre Woodard who plays Jane, who becomes Simon's main ""squeeze"" is also a powerful, powerful performance in its simplicity. The scene of Jane and Simon on their first date is definite academy ward winning acting.

Mary McDonnell as Claire, is a powerful character. All the characters are well developed and different and there is depth to their personalities. Patrick Malone as Otis, Simon's nephew who does not believe he can survive past age 25 is excellent.
Steve Martin as a movie producer who makes blood and guts movies
is a caricature and provides not so much comic relief as ""cad"" relief as he plays a louse. The scene of Steve Martin shot in the leg foaming at the mouth is horrible. Blood is a character in this movie. Blood being scrubbed off the sidewalk. Blood on a cutting board in the kitchen. Blood on the chest of an old man given CPR. Ambulances are a character throughout. There is an omnipresent police helicopter that is a device that separates the ""chapters"" or vignettes of the story. Architecture is interwoven as the beauty of the buildings and their patina in changing light is juxtaposed against the violence coming down around their beauty.

DREAM SCENES:  Characters moving around in their Dreams

Dream sequences of Kevin Kline and Mary McDonell are bizarre and realistic, the way many of our dreams are and shows how we try to work out the issues in our lives in our dreams. There is a sequence of events where Kevin Kline cuts his finger preparing salad in the kitchen, immediately there is an earthquake, and the next door neighbor has a heart attack and the phone line to 911 is busy.....unrealistic???  I think not....ever hear the expression that disasters come in sets of three?  A great depiction of that here and it ties into the dream sequences as well.  To me, the dream sequences though on the surface can be categorized as ""sappy"" by some, indicated to me that the out of control events in the characters' lives even seep into their sleep.  They get no rest even while sleeping because the chaos of life enters into their dream life troubling them as if they were still awake.  Another commentary on contemporary life, to be sure.

I found this to be a finely wrought, highly crafted film that I can watch repeatedly and never tire of. All the criticism of the film listed above and of the Kasdans as producers are pure idiocy. Those reviewers, I can only conclude, have not experienced the spiritual synchronicity depicted in the film and thus ""can't relate"" to it, don't see it as realistic. All of us are on spiritual journeys. Some of us are farther along than others. Kevin Cline's character meaningfully struggles with ""creative meddling"" that he does in other peoples' lives. I suspect many of us rarely introspect about the meddling or impact we have on others. As Mack says, we have to reach out to those who come into our lives and pull us back from the brink.

This is truly a great film.",1009584000,10,6471,4.7060390763765545
1396652,5,B000056BSJ,"First:  This is a deceptively GREAT film.  (. . .)P>Like all Kasdan films (good and bad) this film is, first of all, a visceral dynamo of sound and vision..  The thumping helicopters, oppressive and threatening, quite accurately depicting LA's mood at the height of the crime and crack era.  Certainly there is that lush and epic feel that is Kasdan's chosen genre and signature matrix.
Frankly some folks are clearly offended by his style and I believe that these critics are probably more comfortable with black and white indies, Mamet, and Woody Allen (who, incidentally, fits the self-inflated pretentious mold much more successfully than Kasdan).  But there appears to be a pre-determined spite for the genre and also for any film attempting to deliver a non-cynical ""message"" that stains these reviews and focuses a sad, questioning light on the personal POV of the writer.
I personally love all genres of film... so call me a movie whore.
I may be a sentimentalist.  Certainly Frank Capra captured my tears and soul many years ago.  However, I loved the dark unhappy endings of the 70's, and the most obscure animations of the Balkan film studios.  In my own life I have personally struck the gamut of postures, including that of a smug and cynical film buff.  Cynicism says far more about the cynic than about the film.  I believe that those who hate this film as yet clearly and sadly lack the ability or courage to see the underlying message.
It is a simple and powerful and true one.  There are 2 forces that ultimately define our lives and actions:  Love and Fear.
Fear houses chaos and hate. Intolerance, bigotry.  Paralytic inaction and cynicism.  Violence and dishonesty, and all those other, you know, ""bad"" things.  It is simplest to follow your fear:  you only need to say ""NO"" and you are done.  You only need to destroy, and you are finished.
Love heals, connects, enriches, energizes.... and requires you to act, again and again... to commit, to give, to build, to maintain and nurture, to create.  To touch a stranger.
That takes courage, and often a huge effort to break your pattern.  The results are often mixed.  It can only be prosper as a path, not a result.
The message of the film was simple and profound.  The epic execution was Kasdan's effort to grab your attention, to get you out of your everyday thinking, to drop all the distraction so that the simple message would be heard above your everyday din:
Learn real Love. Then act on it, with each person with whom you come into direct contact.  Hear them, then give something of yourself to their best part.  That simple truth is at the heart of the great prophets... whether Jesus or Muhammed, Buddha or Ghandhi, King or Sadat, Mandela.....
You change the world one step at a time... affecting each person you meet with each action you take, with each focusing attempt to listen.
If you think this is pablum, then try to figure why so many of those who espoused it were tortured, killed or assassinated.
If people weren't so isolated from what's happening around them, who knows.... who knows what tragic events in history might have been averted, or what great dreams may yet come to pass.
But it only happens one touch at a time.  Make the difficult and courageous choice every day.  Be Kind, Respect, Forgive... and above all, learn to Love.
Yep... this is a great film.",1005091200,7,3357,4.716981132075472

Bad films wear their ingredients the way soup labels do. To be really bad, a film should be pretentious and sententious. It should seek to change your life.

film that features Robin Williams in a yarmulke and any film positively reviewed by anyone associated with National Public Radio. Not to mention: WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY LAWRENCE KASDAN.
``If a movie seems to be telling you, between every line, how great it is - if you just know, as you suffer through it, that the writers, or the actors, or the directors, really thought they were doing something great - that's generally the tipoff for me. Smug is the common thread. Movies and stars that scream, `Love me as much as I love myself.' Think `Yentl.''
  Smugness, of course, is the sine qua non of Grand Canyon.",999388800,6,1804,4.9504950495049505
1396654,5,B000056BSJ,"Grand Canyon is simply a movie that shows how connected every person is to another.  No matter your ""state of fortune"" or perception of the world, the movie shows how each and every other type of person will eventually cross your path.  It states, ""You  are the most important person to some, and inconsequential to others"".  I see the movie three ways depending on which characters you follow.
The first way: It makes you believe that no matter what you accomplish, complete or create it pails in the eyes of nature.  That at the end of the day it was all for nothing so don't take it all so seriously.
The second way: You can make a difference.  It shows that a single decision on a  given day can change the course of your life.  That you should follow through with your convictions no matter the resistance you face.  That at the end of the day your decisions shape the landscape and make the world a better place.
The final way: (And the way I see it most)  You are supposed to stay the course.  That everything that happens, happens.  React to, enjoy or escape the situation you encounter but no matter what you decide you are actually part of a bigger world.  That you need to take time to enjoy the accomplishments of others, nature and yourself.  No matter how far you are from other people they are never out of view.  In a moment you can bring together or be seperated from everything you have ever known.  And at the end of the day you will have created your ""Grand Canyon"".",996883200,12,1486,4.388278388278389
1396655,5,B000056BSJ,"There are few films that truley reflect society that we live in.  While Hollywood often adds the typical stuff to movies that make us laugh, cry, and love, this movie has it all but without the Hollywood hype.
The all-star cast is incredible!  While it was not a huge box office success, it should have been and is on my list of one of the best, most forgetten movies of all time.
The acting is superb, the script involving, and the story line realistic.  It doesn't pull any punches and shows us how everyones life, regardless of who you are, where you live, or what you do, is someone intertwined in the fabric that we call America.
This movie will have you feeling good about living in the United States regardless of the horrible situations that we currently live in.",994723200,5,771,4.492857142857143
1396656,4,B000056BSJ,"It is so easy in this epic epoch to upset and depress and generally get us all worked up about what a truly terrible world we live in, and it is just so much harder to show what a wonderful life this is, the freedom and greatness that we have been granted, the love that is available and the power that we actually have to change our own and other peoples lives. This film does that, and though slick and sentimental it is a beautiful and profound piece, and you'll be glad to watch it, and glad to share it.",994723200,4,508,4.09
1396657,5,B000056BSJ,An excellent and eye opener movie. Life is about how some events affect others and our reaction towards them. Ever think about how you met your close friends? This movie is about everything and nothing at the same time. It may be about your life or someone you know. Who knows...,989193600,5,279,4.490196078431373
1396658,5,B000056BSJ,"The first time I saw this movie, I saw the fear in Kevin Kline's eyes as  he is accosted by the black gang, heard the terror in Alfre Woodard's  screams for her daughter as their house is riddled with bullets.  I saw a  completely shocked Steve Martin frothing at the mouth after he was shot by  a street thug for his gold watch.  And sometime later I felt the fear of  his wife after he had a heart attack and almost died.
The second time I  saw this movie, things looked totally different.  I was able to look beyond  the violence, pain, and everything else that seemed to make this movie look  like nothing more than a series of accidents waiting to happen, dashed with  pinches of comic relief from Steve Martin.  All of these things were there  the second time around, but now I saw the great differences in lifestyles  of middle class suburban white family and inner city black family.  And I  saw how the Grand Canyon is a kind of symbol of hope for them all in the  future.
I believe the lesson to be learned from a movie like ""Grand  Canyon"" is that hope never dies.  Violence, suffering, crime, and pain  have always been and will continue to be parts of our lives.  Life is a  giant, constant struggle. What ""Grand Canyon"" teaches us is that  the struggle itself yields its own rewards.  We must all strive to be more  than we are now.  It does not matter if we never actually reach our  ultimate goal, because every little bit helps.",968284800,17,1445,4.350943396226415
1396659,3,B000056BSJ,"Ok, Maybe I'm retarded, but I don't get this movie.  It should be an awesome movie (by looking at the actors and the director) but this movie is just boring.  I hate the girl that Kevin Kline tries to go after.  She's a crummy actor...  The one highlight of this movie, is the great Steve  Martin.  Once the movie is over, you wonder, ""Why wasn't Steve Martin  in tha movie more?""  He's the only reason I gave it a 3!  Viewers  beware...this movie is boring.",961027200,2,458,4.2823529411764705
1396660,1,B000056BSJ,"Obvioulsy, everybody involved in this project thought they were making a masterpiece. They didn't. The result is one of the most boring movies ever made, irritantingly slow, trying to be ""great"", ""give a  message"", but is so obvious it made me sick!",957744000,6,249,4.928571428571429
1396661,5,B000056BSJ,"Very few films manage to tell a story that is about synchronicity of events and people connections to each other and yet is not preachy. There is a subtle spiritual quality to this film that provides a positive  foundation to the story which is about the deeper aspects of life that  brings meaning to all of the running around, working, family, kids, etc.  that is prevalent in American life. Especially effective in the soundtrack  which creates a taught atmosphere. The connections made between people in  this film serve to remind me of what is possible in reaching out to others  seemingly different than myself. Bravo!",956361600,10,624,4.895238095238096
1396662,5,B000056BSJ,"Grand Canyon is in my top five film favorites of all time.  This is a story that is equally powerful about race as Spike Lee's ""Do the right thing"".  It shows someone from each cohort of society and how closely  linked each of us truly are.  Despite how far apart each of the characters  lives may be they come together under different circumstances.  Proving the  six degrees of separation theory to be that much more true.  Steve Martin's  character receives a gunshot wound that has incredible realism.  Too often  we see violence on television and don't believe it is real.  This is real.  One of the best of all time.  Can't wait for the DVD.",955152000,5,647,4.51304347826087
1396663,5,B000056BSJ,This is a movie I pop in the VCR every time I want to be reminded that miracles happen every day if you're just willing to recognize them.  It reminds me that we are all connected to each other and that sometimes a  crisis is just a blessing in disguise...  I highly recommend this movie!  Uplifting and wonderful!,953596800,6,314,4.362068965517241

1396665,5,B000056BSJ,I have to agree with all the other superlative reviews. I'm writing to call upon the studio to release this excellent film on DVD in widescreen (or even on VHS in widescreen) which I would immediately buy.,948412800,7,205,4.5675675675675675
1396666,5,B000056BSJ,"Wow!  This Is probably the best movie I've ever seen.  AFter I saw it I immediately fell in love with Mary McDonnell's character Claire.  But, overall the movie itself stands alone.  The symbolism all over this movie  signifies many things, that even after watching it about 10 times, I learn  something new in it. I counted the helicopter and/or the sound of it 10  times.  I know it has significance too.  Perhaps its God's way of watching  over us in the struggles of life we go through everyday. Maybe its his  reminder that he'll take care of us if we only let him.  The movie takes  almost every situation and circumstance that we go through in modern times  and shows how we might deal with them or relate to them ourselves. AFter I  saw this I wanted to find every movie I could on Mary McDonnell.  OF  course, she is fabulous in Dances with Wolves, but in my opinion this movie  takes the cake! This movie is definitely a classic, and anyone who is a  movie fan, should watch just for the enjoyment.  I, too, enjoyed the  opening scene with Basketball game. That was when I used to be huge Lakers  fan too, great memories seeing those guys again. Magic, Worthy etc. Rent  this movie and you want be disappointed!  Even Steve Martin does a great  job as a serious character, violent, but even he has revelation, as one  would put it. This movie is reality as it could be , especially those in  California. Buy it today!",945734400,6,1427,4.430232558139535
1396667,5,B000056BSJ,"Grand Canyon had all the elements of an excellent thought-provoking movie.  It made you think about life, relationships, and one's own view of the world around them.  It also had a great deal of symbolism which had  spiritual and metaphysical undertones, and made the film very much  philosophical in nature.  All of the cast did an excellent job and I  consider the movie a classic, which can be viewed many times over.",944438400,,420,4.763888888888889
1396668,5,B000056BSJ,"The first time I found this movie standing on the shelf of a videostore, I thought the cast was breathtaking... I knew Mr. Lawrence Kasdan for his work in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Return of the  Jedi"", but that was about it.
The first 3 minutes sequence, really  grabbed me. The music, photography, the subtle message, the edition...  Instantly, I knew this was a piece of art... After watching it whole, I  couldn't do anything else but to watch it again, sometimes while I worked  at the computer... just letting the dialogues sink in.
The power of this  film on anyone with an open mind, can be overwhelming. It's not a  pretentious movie,it's a realistic one. I have placed it in the top 10  movies I've ever seen, and as a screenwriter on his beginnings, believe me,  I've seen a lot... this one is unique.  All the performances as well really  stand out.",933552000,7,870,4.548387096774194

What a ride....Central theme that runs thru the film, and the helicopter that connects the maze of  what life is like in L.A.......is utterly fantastic.  A  must-see-own-see-when-down film.

1396670,4,B000056BSJ,This movie successfully intertwines real life - full of the good and bad - and guides us to the realization that good must overcome the bad. We must live each day as if it were our last because it just might be.  I have  read many reviews of this movie and no one even mentions the helicopter -  so did they not notice it?  I believe the helicopter with the light  shining down over the city represents an ever present God watching over His  people? What do you think?,931046400,2,468,4.202247191011236
