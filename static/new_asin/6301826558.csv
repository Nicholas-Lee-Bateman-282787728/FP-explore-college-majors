372878,5,6301826558,"I must admit that I was intimidated by ""Intolerance"" before sitting down to watch it.  I knew it was an early silent movie (1916) consisting of four different stories.  I knew that the three hour running time would be spent intercutting between these four stories.  Would I be able to keep up with all four stories?  Would I be able to tell the different characters apart in the grainy black and white (with color-tinting)?
After watching it, I have a whole new appreciation for D.W. Griffith.  Yes, I was able to tell the characters apart, and yes, I was able to keep up with all the storylines.  This film was a giant leap forward in filmmaking from Griffith's previous film, ""The Birth of a Nation.""  The most impressive story of the film is the fall of Babylon.  The sets were magnificent, and the battle scenes were spectacular.  Constance Talmadge was wonderful as the Mountain Girl. The modern story was entertaining and moving.  The French and Judean stories were very underdeveloped, but that really didn't bother me.
Anyone with an interest in silent movies or film history must see this film.",980121600,46,1103,4.757894736842105

Perhaps he's the lone customer who saw ""A Night at the Roxbury"",  whatever the reason, don't go by his review.  If you notice, he's also the  only one who gave it 1 star.  Everybody else gave it 5.  It is definetly  worth having, as a matter of fact it's a MUST!  If your a silent film buff,  this has to be in your collection, as well as, ""The Birth of a  Nation"".

372881,1,6301826558,"Ah,D.W. Griffith-according to his admirers,he is the great originator of our cinema,the fountainhead from whence all creativity springs.""Intolerance"",supposedly his greatest oeuvre,is considered a work of art so staggeringly excellent that some speak of it as the zenith of film art-indeed of civilization itself. Generally,when many (and I assume intelligent) people praise a film and its director,there tends to be something in it. But in the case of D.W. Griffith and especially ""Intolerance"",I cannot defer to the majority opinion. In my viewings of this director's films,I could only come to one conclusion-that while his historical importance is undeniable,most of his films seem to to be textbook definitions of bad art.""Intolerance"", in particular,has so many egregious instances of this,that in all fairness I should acknowledge the merits D.W. Griffith undoubtedly has. These are dual-his films tend to be well-constructed and in conjunction with an effective,albeit crude,editing style-he builds a rhythm which gives his narratives tension and force. His faults,however,are legion-he makes good actors(Lillian Gish,Richard Bartlemass)look foolish,not so good actors(Donald Crisp,80% of his players)look insanely foolish,his plots are of the same claptrap that's been making itself ridiculous since the Restoration,his mis-en-scene is tasteless and worst of all-his sentimentality has to be the most flagrant I've ever seen. Not that there is anything wrong with sentimentality per se-many artists were good in spite of it or knew how to handle it tastefully-Thomas Heywood,Chikamatsu Monzaemon,Carlo Goldoni,Charles Dickens and Frank Capra come to mind. But Griffith's bathos achieves the nadir.  A perfect example of this is the ""little dear one"".""Little dear ones""(of which ""Intolerance"" has two!)  are a recurring type of character in D.W. Griffith's films. They are usually teenage girls(directed to act like they are five) who flounce about hugging trees and chasing cute forest animals. These actions always induce any nearby male(virtuous or villainous)into frenzies of drool-slobbering lust. An attempt at ravishment always ensues. This is the sort of ""dramatic"" scene that D.W. Griffith intends to be both harrowing and heartbreaking-but is always embarrassing and sidesplitting.  Even Griffith's famous technical skills are compromised in ""Intolerance"".It is well known that for time considerations,""Intolerance"" was shortened-thus the film's structure was destroyed when then the French and Christ scenes were drastically curtailed to make room for the Babylonian and modern stories. The firt two stories barely even constitute a narrative. Even such a technical tour-de-force as the famous tracking shot in the Babylonian sequence is marred by what is actually being depicted-some absurd dancing elephants,girls holding still in a ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" pose for no explicable reason,etc. Speaking of the Babylonian story,despite the praise lavished on it,I think it is the most unmitigated piece of unintentional camp ever put on celluloid-I've never seen anything so amusingly awful in my life. The modern story,however,is comparatively restrained and has its effective moments-but even it degenerates into mechanical melodrama. And it is not just the case(as has been alleged)that Griffith was working with inferior material-Eisenstein had even worse to work with and yet,his genius shines through. D.W. Griffith may have been the founding father of movies-but for great cinema one must look to his contemporaries Charlie Chaplin and Erich Von Stroheim.  END END",950227200,15,3589,5.843511450381679
372882,5,6301826558,"Intolerance is a movie that forces the audience to deal with inhumanity throughout the course of history. Too often it is said that it was an apology for the movie D.W. Griffith made the previous year, The Birth of A  Nation. Actually to the contrary it was a furthering of its themes. In the  hands of a less competent director, the intertwining of four story lines  would leave the viewer baffled and frustrated. However, Griffith uses cross  cutting to increase the intensity of his stand against intolerance. Each  story feeds off each other until the time gap seems like nothing more a  geographical one. As the intensity builds, the scenes get shorter and  shorter creating a multi climax that is among the greatest in film history.  Although only the second serious American film, it holds up as one of the  most brilliantly directed movies to this day. Critics and those who oppose  his anti war and anti intolerance message will find miniscule flaws and  call Griffith a racist. Intolerance and Birth of a Nation aren't at all a  platform to promote racism but are instead a serious statement about man's  long history of cruelty. From impatient northern abolitionist to the  Uplifters Griffith shows us the dangerous consequences of fanaticism. The  abolitionist fanaticism results in the death of over one million Americans  while the Uplifters fanaticism results in mothers losing their babies,  prohibition, and censorship. In this way, Intolerance is a haunting  prophecy. Within three years of its release, the US Congress passed an  amendment that banned alcohol and within twenty years the Legion of Decency  had firm control over freedom of speech.

The only reason I could not give this edition the full five stars is because of the background music, a score by Joseph Turrin. It is well done for what it is, but it does *not* sound like the period in which the music was made. It was jarring at times to hear musical constructs in a film made in 1916 that would have been commonplace decades later, and to add to the anachronism, it was programmed on a synthesizer for crying out loud, which the world would not see for another 50 years or so!

373130,5,6301826558,"I borrowed ""Intolerance"" from the library first, since it's rather pricey, at least compared to my other DVDs. Don't even BOTHER with the cheaper versions. The one put out by Image Entertainment is far superior to them, both in image and sound quality (I know, I got a cheaper one by mistake, then got the Image Entertainment one, just like the library DVD).
It is most spectacularly done. Here are, literally, casts of thousands. The depiction of Babylon is particularly striking. D W Griffith had an actual 300 foot high wall built,and there are enough people around to make Babylon look brought back to life. You really feel as if you are there. Some of the battle scenes are startlingly gory. You can almost taste the pall of smoke hanging over the city. There is a subplot of a young woman with a crush on the king, who goes into battle as an archer just for him, ending tragically. All very well acted. Breathtaking stuff, here, done in the days when there were no special effects or digitized ANYTHING, in the days before actors unions and monolithic studios.
The story of Jesus is equally well done, with some attention to small details. Never before have I seen Jesus look pained at the Pharisees turning away when He greeted them, but they show it here,along with the joy of the newly wed couple when the water is turned to wine, the joy of the forgiven adulteress, and other things. Again, you feel as if you were there, with all the period costumes and authentic looking sets. The acting is also fine here, and the actor chosen to play Jesus is tall, strong looking and carries himself erect, but is neither strikingly handsome nor effeminate of face, so seems more like the ""not comely, that man should desire him"" Savior spoken of in the Bible. Excellent acting, again.
The modern story is well done, too,with enough plot twists to keep you guessing,and the last few minutes are VERY suspenseful. The characters are easy to relate to. I must admit that Griffith's referring to a young man's incarceration (he WAS framed) as being ""intolerated away in a jail"" as a bit silly, though.
The story of the Huguenots is well done, too. The royal court is lavishly decorated, which just shows the more plainly the contrast between the opulent royal lifestyles and the way the Huguenots lived, in their very plain, unadorned houses with plain wood chairs instead of velvet cushioned ones. The slaughter of them is heart breaking, with the implied killing of  a baby in its grandmother's arms.
Some critics say that not all the stories depicted even SHOW intolerance, but I think they're mistaken. In my opinion, the ""modern"" story clearly shows the misery brought upon other people by the greed of the ""reformer"" group, who show blatant intolerance towards people who aren't as ""upright"" as they are. They are especially opposed to drinking and dancing, and managed to put a stop to both, locally, then open a children's home, where they place the babies and children that they legally snatch from non-upright mothers. The financial needs of the group get so great that their chief benefactor goes to her wealthy brother, who owns an industry, and he cuts ALL wages 10 percent so he can continue to give the group the money they need. This leads to a strike,quite naturally, which is violently put down, leaving some workers dead, and others leave the plant to work elsewhere and slide into poverty. So the intolerance of the ""upright"" group leaves everyone but them worse off. The story of Jesus,of course, points to the intolerance of the Jewish leaders towards this young, perfect Upstart, and nothing will satisfy them but His death. The Babylonian story shows how the intolerance of one passionate high priest towards others of other religions (including his own king) leads him to treasonously aid and abet a rival king in getting into the city of Babylon and overthrowing it. And the story of the Protestant French Huguenots under an intolerant Catholic king,and queen mother,of course shows their intolerance for the Huguenots, leading to them being slaughtered by the French Catholic soldiers.
It's nearly 3 hours long, but well worth it as terrific,well done escapism and historical drama (which most of it is).",1373932800,4,4226,4.82896551724138
373131,5,6301826558,"What do you expect?  It's only the most ambitious film ever made.  (Hey, Amazon.  Really?  You needed eight more words?)",1369440000,,120,4.85
373132,3,6301826558,This is an old movie - fairly interesting but probably not one to watch often. We ordered it to get ideas of costumes of the era.,1359849600,,129,4.0
373133,5,6301826558,"It's very clear how Intolerance - which wasn't on the original AFI Top 100 listing - somehow launched into the #49 spot on the 10th anniversary listing. It all has to do with director D. W. Griffith's previous work, Birth of a Nation.

Birth of a Nation was on the first listing. It certainly represented a stellar moment in moviemaking. It earned the #44 spot in the first ever ranking of all movies. Griffith, back in 1915, had achieved quite a momentous milestone. He had made a silent film which had a full cast, beautiful scenery, an engaging storyline, and situations which would get the world talking. Unfortunately for Griffith, the content of that film was black-bashing in some of the vilest forms we have seen in movies before or since. I did a full review of Birth of a Nation, and in it I talk about how stunned I was to watch this unfold before me. Trying to judge it on its ""technical merits"", I explain, is like trying to judge the culinary merits of a fine dinner made from chopped-up baby. There is just no way to separate out what is being experienced from how foul the whole concept is.

There was HUGE outcry when the AFI put this movie onto their first Top 100 listing. Yes, again, I understand it was groundbreaking. And even so, I was not happy having it on the list.

Intolerance was Griffith's next work. Even in 1915 there was an enormous outcry against Birth of a Nation and people around the world accused Griffith of being racist. He made this movie in an attempt to redeem himself. One could say that Birth of a Nation was a mere stepping stone to the even fuller presentation of storyline, epic landscapes, casts of thousands, and other lush filmmaking technologies that Griffith presented here. I.e. this is not just a ""consolation prize"" for having Birth of a Nation ejected. It really does deserve to be on the AFI list in its own right.

You have to settle in for a long haul here. It's over 3 hours long, with subtitles that hang on the screen for seemingly hours at a time. There are long shots of men staring up at the sky and women staring with wild eyes at the screen. Pour a glass of wine. Or two. Be patient.

You get four different intertwined stories. Jesus and his crucifixion. The Huguenots being slaughtered in France. The Babylonians being taken down by jealousy. And workers struggling to live in ""modern day"" 1916. We see how little humans have changed over the years. We still love and dream, we hate and fear, we launch out after goals and we are struck down by fate. We never know, until the end, how each story will end up. (Well I suppose we know how the Christ story will end up).

And, surprisingly, where so many other movies even today barely feature a female character except to have her be a ""arm candy"" for the men, we have a wealth of characters of all styles here in Intolerance. We have upper class and prostitutes. We have rich kings and struggling slaves. We have elegant clothes and nearly-naked people. The Mountain Girl picks up a bow and fights along side the men. ""Musketeers"" - or gang lords - ruled the streets in the early 1900s. Corruption was rampant. There was corruption in the French court, and in Babylon too. Humanity faces the same issues over and over again.

Yes, sometimes the film is a bit heavy-handed in its message. I think it's important to remember the outrage that Griffith had just faced, that he was now trying to overcome. To his credit, the sets are enormous and the wealth of characters is fairly stunning. So many movies of the time were just about rich white men and what they did in life. Here we get a wide variety of characters to relate to.

Well recommended, both as a stage of moviemaking history and as an interesting view of the human condition.",1351641600,5,3754,4.502202643171806
373134,5,6301826558,"I have seen ""Intolerance"", since the early 1970s, over eight times, and the more I watch it the more amazed I am with this silent classic. For years I considered it the number one of the greatest movie ever made. In it you have social criticism, history, romance, comedy, tragedy [and plenty!] and action. Four different stories are tangled in one another with an recurrent motive of time [the mother with the cradle played by legendary Lillian Gish] goes by. D W Griffith ""Intolerance"" will influence the cinema in ways he never imagined. Alexander Korda [yes, who produced those British classics like ""The Private Lives of Henry VIII"" with Charles Laughton in 1933 and ""Things to Come"" of 1935, plus others] admired this movie and gave him the inspiration to make his own. The same said by Sergei Eisenstein [""Potemkin Battleships"" and ""Alexander Nevski""] the soviet film director. Also Alfred Hitchcock, DeMille and Michael Curtis never hide their admiration for this classic. With, besides Gish, Mae Marsh, Sheena Owen, Miriam Cooper and Walter Long, plus others, one can call ""Intolerance"" the ""mother"" of all movies. And one final comment: before Hitchcock did his many famous cameo roles in his movies [like catching the bus and failing in ""North by Northwest""], Griffith did his own as the drunkard being robbed in ""The Modern Story"".",1332720000,4,1342,5.022421524663677
373135,5,6301826558,"Quite possibly the greatest movie to be made during the silent movie era. ""Intolerance"" was made by Griffith after the backlash he experienced from the release of ""Birth Of A Nation"". It is said he made this film as an apology for the way people reacted to ""Nation"" and as a protest against racism. ""Intolerance"" is actually four stories interwoven with all four stories dealing with the subject of intolerance against people with different religious beliefs. Three of the stories deal with actual historic events including the St Bartholomew's day massacre of the Huguenot's in 15th century France , the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the fall of Babylon. The forth story is a fictional one set in modern times, 1916 being the modern time, about a poor girl whose life is repeatedly ruined by zealous social workers which includes having her baby taken away from her. The story line is complicated and you need to concentrate to keep up with what is going on but all four stories are well told and interesting. The sets that were built for the Babylon story are remarkable and once again you see the panoramic shots that was developed by Griffith, and used for the first time during filming of ""Birth Of A Nation"", to show the ancient city. Yes it is a long movie and yes the stories are complicated but no you should not skip seeing this movie. Like ""Birth Of A Nation"" this is a true masterpiece that should seen at least once by anyone who calls themselves a movie fan.",1327017600,3,1483,4.642585551330798
373136,5,6301826558,"While I'm still on a D.W.Griffith roll,decided to continue with his next movie ""Intolerance"" supposedly made as reaction to criticism of his previous work.
Because ""Birth of the Nation"" was such a huge success,no expenses were spared in financing what must be the biggest movie extravaganza of all times - if you think mass scenes in 1915. masterpiece were huge,think again - this time Griffith topped himself with enormous sets towering over Hollywood and mass scenes were breath-taking in scope and dimensions - where today movie makers simply use computer animation and tricks to create illusion of thousands,Griffith literally used thousands of actors to re-act ancient Babylon (and that was just one part of the story).

The vision is fine,but unfortunately Griffith bite more than he could chew this time - you might even call it megalomanic - instead of focusing on one story,he goes simultaneously into four different periods in history to hammer home his idea that human nature basically never changes. What could easily have been four movies he presents as four chapters - its like ""Birth of the Nation"" times four - it ended up being such a long saga that audience at the times were not prepared to watch it and although it wasn't disaster,it could never re-pay finances invested in its realization,therefore Griffith was forced to abandon such a large projects and focus on relatively smaller-scale  stories without battlefields,horses,elephants and trains running. Who knows how he felt about it,but we can guess he never gave up in his desire to prove brilliance of this movie to the world and later played with it forever,shortened it,re-edited everything,cut into pieces and glued again,in the process some parts were forever lost and what we can see today is similar to ancient sculpture broken into pieces and somehow put together by archeologists who can only guess about its real appearance.

Four stories follow characters in modern time,ancient Babylon,Jerusalem and 16. century Paris - all four have spectacular mass scenes,thousands of actors and sets that were inspired by famous paintings (for example,the morning after St. Bartholomew massacre Queen Catherine de Medici stands at the gates of Louvre among slaughtered corpses of huguenots,this scene actually faithfully re-acts historical painting). Unfortunately,because of film re-editing,cuts and later patchwork, stories set in Jerusalem and Paris are all but lost (we get only several tantalizing glimpses into what they looked like) and what was left are stories set in Babylon and modern times,still exciting enough  as they were but clearly these are pieces of broken mirror that nobody was able to put together again.

Personally I found the movie way overlong and had to stop at certain point and watch the rest another time (contemporary audience in 1916. must have been overwhelmed with all this) but after few days when I decided to see the rest,I actually enjoyed it very much and had to re-think my opinion. Even in this brutally edited version it still has huge appeal,excellent actors,brilliant historical costumes and lots of visual details to enjoy - I don't see how these four stories could have been more shortened (if he tried to make it into 2-hours movie it would be simply incomprehensible) so my conclusion is - five stars all the way,no matter how shortened or tampered with. I found myself thinking about the movie days after I watched it,so it truly left strong impression on me.

Is it better than ""Birth of the Nation""? Well,it's oranges and apples - ""Birth"" was first and covered just one story,here we have four. ""Intolerance"" ended up being broken into hundred pieces while ""Birth"" survives relatively intact. But if you ask me,""Intolerance"" is unforgettable while ""Birth"" comes as racist embarrassment today,something we have to admit but don't want to really remember. So,five stars for ""Intolerance"".",1301961600,6,3914,5.204761904761905
373137,3,6301826558,"I first saw this when I was about 10 on Orson Wells's then-popular show on silent movies (the intro from that episode is shown here-a nostaligic treat). I did not know what to make of it then, being the first silent movie I ever saw, and I remembered little of it other than the woman rocking the cradle (i.e., ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle Rules the World"") to bookend the various scenes. Well I saw it this weekend in my maturity, so here goes.

In 1916, audiences were confused by the story (or stories, I should say) and the constant switching between the various tales of Intolerance (the prohibitionists of 1916, the persecuation of the French Hugenots, a fragmented version of the story of Christ, and a tale on intrigue from Ancient Babylon) is not too endearing to modern viewers who tend to like their stories more straightforward.

The prohibitionist story will give much fodder to the armchair analysts. Here Griffith portrays them as a group of middle aged spinsters bitter over their lost youth (today, these fortyish women would still be kicking as cougars), thus they take their repressed energy out on dancehalls, whorehouses, and saloons. They go so far as to deem a young woman an unfit mother for drinking beer and whisky (in moderation) in the presence of her baby. This conservative view of reformers would still resonate with many today.

The Babylon tale is a bit hard to follow, in part because of the constant cutting back and forth with the other stories, but more time appears to be spend on this story than the others. A bit of intrigue between two rival priests of idol gods that lead to war and a love triangle. I was personally quite unmoved by this story. Cecil B. DeMille would improve on ancient spectacles in the decades to come. SIDENOTE-It's interesting to compare Griffith's horrifically racist view of Blacks in ""Birth of a Nation"" with the (albeit brief) shots of dignified Ethiopian soldiers in this film's Babylon sequence.

The Christ sequence takes only a few moments of the most famous story of our time, but apparently it figues thsat most people would know the tale, so this serves as a way of referencing the Christ story. The French Hugenot story, after an intriguing start, quicky goes haywirse without proper story development.

Overall, a major historical landmark. But unless you are a dedicated film historian, keep you piloow and alarm clock handy by your DVD player.",1297641600,3,2425,4.805755395683454
373138,4,6301826558,"For his follow-up to (and, some suggest, apology for) Birth of a Nation, D. W. Griffith was not content to merely make another epic but rolled four epics into one to create his 'Sun-Play of the Ages.' At the time, many of its innovations were rejected by public and critics alike (many complained that the tracking shots brought on dizziness) and its reputation has suffered more from the subsequent mindless repetition of the 'accepted opinion' by people who have not actually seen it than its own failings. Taken on its own merits, these are far outweighed by its achievements.

The project grew out of the section that would become The Mother and the Law, later released as a separate feature, in which an industrialist cuts the wages of his employees by 10% to finance a moral crusade (""They squeeze the money out of us and use it to advertise themselves by reforming us"" cries a surprisingly sympathetically depicted union man). In the resulting strike the troops are called in, with the ensuing deaths throwing the families of two of his workers into desperation and crime. Alongside this are three other tales of intolerance through the ages; the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of the Huguenots in 16th Century France; the death of Christ; and, with little relevance but mighty spectacle, the fall of Babylon. Linking them all is Lillian Gish, rocking a child through the cradle of the ages.

Griffith's brand of sentimentality is sometimes hard to take, especially with character names like Brown Eyes and The Little Dear One. The final scene of soldiers throwing down their weapons and prison bars replaced by fields of flowers seem particularly over-optimistic when viewed in its context of a world at war by the time the film was released in 1916, and some sequences have dated in the worst way: he Sacred Dance in memory of the resurrection of Tammuz in the Temple of Love is a surreal cross between the Charleston and Monty Python, while its orgy scenes seem an obvious inspiration for De Mille's later excesses. But amid the miscalculations there are a few astonishingly natural moments and performances.

The cross-cutting between the stories is the film's boldest stroke, although not always successful due to their varying quality and relevance. The French and Judean episodes come off worst, the latter being a series of dreary tableaux where the only interest is trying to spot future directors Erich Von Stroheim and Todd Browning. Despite the fame and cinematic sweep of the Babylonian story, it's the modern story, with its genuine sense of outrage that is the best and most powerful of the quartet. After a rather over-sentimental start, as an example of the filmmaker's art it's a work of genius with few equals in early silent cinema.

Intolerance is still a great cinematic experience that has much to recommend it, although you do have to be careful which version you pick up with so many public domain versions available - many cut or even transferred at the wrong speed. Kino's is probably the best of the bunch, a near-complete version in a good transfer with a decent selection of extras: introduction by Orson Welles, extracts from Cabiria (1914) and The Last Days of Pompeii (1914), `happy ending' from The Fall of Babylon and extracts from two pamphlets by D.W. Griffith.",1292716800,4,3305,4.917562724014337

373190,5,6301826558,"With the success of D.W. Griffith's masterpiece, ""The Birth of the Nation"" in 1915, Griffith went on to create his most ambitious and expensive film yet.  ""Intolerance"" was a film that Griffith wanted to create.  From inspiration of epic films such as ""Cabiria"" and ""The Last Days of Pompeii"", ""Intolerance"" would feature 125,000 men and women along with 7,500 horses.  Also, featured is a lavish, extremely detailed set and beautiful costume design created for each different era depicted in the film.  Needless to say, nearly a hundred years after this film was created, we can only be in awe by what is seen visually.

In today's film even using technology, what D.W. Griffith created would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to create and for something this epic, CG would have to be used to showcases such elaborate (and also historically accurate) sets and show many thousands of people.  But to think, Griffith accomplished this for his film.  How he did it, no one knows.  In fact, no studio would even dare approve such a film today but somehow, Griffith managed to make this film happen in 1916 for nearly $400,000.  Incredible and unbelievable but it's true.  Granted, several hundred thousand dollars was a lot of money back then but it's hard to believe that the film was not created for over  a million dollars.

But the most unfortunate thing to happen to D.W. Griffith in regards to ""Intolerance"" was the film's box office failure.  The film made a lot of money when it was first released but unlike Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" which had years to make money after it was released, ""Intolerance"" and the whole film industry just went through a major slow down mode as World War I was approaching.  No longer can filmmakers depend on the international box office and people were not in a movie watching mood.  Needless to say, no one expected World War I to hit so hard but it did and Griffith, carried the big burden of debt from this film and other future films which unfortunately, put himself in a situation that he had difficult recovering from.

""Intolerance"" was just an enormous film.  In fact, its original cut put the film about eight hours long.  The film has been released on DVD from Kino Video and also Image and both are nearly three hours long and interesting enough, both DVD's contain different scenes from each other while Kino's version has a better print transfer.

So, what is ""Intolerance"" about?  Let us look at the definition from Merriam-Webster:

1 : unable or unwilling to endure
2 a : unwilling to grant equal freedom of expression especially in religious matters b : unwilling to grant or share social, political, or professional rights : bigoted

""Intolerance"" is a film about the lack of tolerance which have led to the worst situations in history.  The film is divided into four storylines covering various eras.  The Babylonian (539 B.C.), the Judean (A.D. 27), the Renaissance (1572 France) and United States (1914).

The film shows us how ""Intolerance"" led to the fall of Babylon because of the introduction of religion and various groups believing in different gods, the Judean storyline covers Jesus Christ's crucifixion, the Renaissance covers the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (a war over religion) and in the U.S., how corporate greed has hurt America, women campaigning against indecency and more.

VIDEO:

""Intolerance is presented in full-frame (1:33:1) and depending on each scene, there are different color tinting used for various era's.  For example, during the Babylonian scene, we get sepia and red.  During Lillian Gish's scene as she is rocking the cradle, her scene is in blue.  Others are sepia, grayscale, green, orange, purple and thus, there was a bit of experimentation going on with the color tinting (which was quite popular during the teens).

Picture quality ranges from really good to some that have some warping and negative degradation.  But for the most part, the video quality is very good and for those who have watched various versions of the film, I have been told that this Kino Video release is the best print version out there on video.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Intolerance"" features the music composed and performed by Joseph Turrnin.  Turrin's music matches up with the film quite well but I have not watched various versions of the film on video which have a different musical score, so I am unable to comment on how Turrin's score compares to the others.  But from this score alone, he did a fantastic job.

Intertitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Intolerance"" comes with the following special features:

  * Introduction by Orson Welles - (4:34) For ""The Silent Years"", shown on television back in the '70s, Orson Welles introduced the films.  In this feature, we watch the introduction as Welles comments on the film and the closing words after the film was shown on television.
  * Excerpt of the Last Days of Pompeii (1913) - (3:10)  An excerpt from ""The Last Days of Pompeii"", one of the epic films that D.W. Griffith was inspired by before creating ""Intolerance"".
  * Excerpt of Cabiria (1914) - (5:01) An excerpt from ""Cabiria"", one of the epic films that D.W. Griffith was inspired by before creating ""Intolerance"".
  * Excerpt of the Fall of Babylon (alternate ending) - (:59) Because of how the storyline ended with the Mountain Girl for the Babylon scene, for the full length film version of the Babylon storyline ala ""The Fall of Babylon"", a different ending was created.
  * Pamphlets - Using your remote, you can view the various pamphlets used in 1916 to promote the film.
  * About the score - Using your remote, you can read information about the musical score by Joseph Turrin.
  * The Book - The following features text that can be accessed via remote which provides a summation of the structure and ideology of the epic film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Intolerance"" is an epic film that just epitomizes the word ""ambitious"" when describing a film.

I was shocked to see how much went into creating this film and in awe about how epic this film came to be.  The production design is incredible, the costume design is numerous and the fact that over a hundred thousand people took part in this film and were outfitted in some sort of costume is incredible.

""Intolerance"" is an incredible film but by no means is it an easy film to watch.  Rarely do I need to take breaks to watch a film but ""Intolerance"" was a first for me, in that I had to watch it in four sittings.  Even Orson Welles was correct about how complex the film is and could you imagine how audiences who sat hours to watch this film in 1916, even in 2010, its one of those films that you want to soak in and just watch and have the ability to rewind.

I found myself being in awe by watching the overall design and overall surrounding of each scenery and how it was shot that I was missing out on the main characters and watching them act.  So, I was constantly rewinding because there are many things going on and then the shifts through different era's, it's easy to get confused.

So, in many ways, we are very fortunate for DVD players, because we can easily rewatch certain scenes.  Audiences back then who had to watch this movie in one sitting, I'm sure they were in awe as I was, when it came to seeing how much detail and work went to create this film but I can imagine how viewers can easily be lost.

With that being said, my favorite segments of ""Intolerance"" were the storylines that D.W. Griffith ended up making two films out of and that was the modern U.S. and the Fall of Babylon storyline.  Granted, I wish there was a way to catch these films by itself on DVD.  The Babylon sequence is just remarkable to watch and how they created those sets, absolutely impressive.  Also, for Constance Talmadge fans, this film is what helped make her silent film career.  But in terms of overall storylne, the modern storyline has a lot of depth to it.

From seeing the corporations take on the employees that strike (no shields, but police firing on striking employees) to women who go to the homes of women they deem unfit and taking their babies and putting them up for adoption.  But most of all, an actual storyline that deals with false imprisonment and murder.

Overall, ""Intolerance"" is not an easy film to watch straight through.  Again, I'm not known for taking breaks on a film and I prefer to watch every film in one sitting but for ""Intolerance"", it was difficult.  Not because of the complexities of the storyline but because I found myself rewinding because I know I was missing details.  I was really taking in the cinematography, the sets, the costumes and overall performances that each time there was a switch to a different era, I ended up rewatching sequences over and over.  And because of that, I would not have been a good candidate to watch this film back in 1916 because it is a film that could be quite exhaustive.

But I did enjoy this film but I will not be content until I see the full 3 hour and 30 minute version of the film.  I know there are details that are missing and until I watch a complete restored version of the film (which we know is available), somehow I hope it gets released on DVD or Blu-ray within our lifetime.

For now, the Kino Video version of the film is still an impressive DVD release that can be purchased ala standalone but if you really want the best experience and to watch even more awesome silent films from D.W. Griffith, the Griffith Masterworks DVD box sets are highly recommended.

In the end, ""Intolerance"" is a film that I believe those who are passionate about cinema should at least watch once in their lifetime.  It may not be a film that I can see myself watching repeatedly from start to finish over and over again but it's definitely the most ambitious film that I have seen yet.

A DVD release that is definitely recommended!",1271721600,,9887,4.682898550724638

373192,5,6301826558,"Intolerance is an incredible masterpiece. It truly deserves a detailed description/commentary to encourage viewing, for it is a movie that should be required viewing for all educated people, not just film enthusiasts, and should be ranked amongst the TOP five movies ever made in America. It has been compared by critics to masterpieces in other arts, as it should, because it is the work of a creative genius and a true work of art.
It should also be watched several times, as it is not only very enjoyable on further viewings, but necessary in order to fully appreciate the complexity and beauty of the film. There are also several versions aside from this one, which I have not seen, but would be curious to explore, as they may have additional or different footage.

Griffith was heavily influenced by two movies that preceeded his creation, an Italian production form 1914 ""Cabiria"" and ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" (Caserini version, 1913) Both had excerpts in this disc under the special features, which I watched after the movie and found most helpful in understanding Griffith's vision.

""Intolerance"" encompasses four different stories tied together by the theme of intolerance, with first place given to religious intolerance. From the beginning, the film jumps from one to the other of the stories (and this was one of the great innovations that it introduced) with the interlocking image of a woman by the cradle representing the passage of the generations (Lillian Gish). I have read that the original footage was eight hours long and that Ms. Gish said it should have been shown as was. After seeing this version, which is almost three hours, I would agree to say that it would be probably an interesting experience, but not as effective an impression.

 The stories are in historical order: 1-The Fall of Babylon to Cyrus the Great 2-The story of Christ, concentrated to some highlights 3- Massacre of St. Bartholomew in 16th Century France 3- A Contemporary story of class struggle and injustice.

The most developed is the Contemporary tale which is a full feature, followed by the Babylonian tale which is almost a full feature and then the more reduced Huguenot and Christ stories.
What is incredible about this movie is how well it holds together, given the daunting task of four different plots, that even today after almost a full century of movie-watching experience, remains extraordinary.

However the difficulty in maintaining a strong story line is what probably accounts for the film's commercial failure.
Even in our age of text messages and video clips there are not that many people out there comfortable spanning and understanding four totally different time periods simultaneously. Needless to say, even with the notes that were interjected in the titles, it would also be very hard to follow the Babylonian and St. Bartholomew plots without some background information. The Christ story would be daunting for non-Christian viewers as it is very barely sketched and assumes the viewer knows it well.

The  amazing discovery for me was that as far as historical films is concerned, we have been decaying since, as I have never seen anything that approximates his evocation of the times depicted here. In the case of the French court, it is almost as if Griffith had ressurected the players from portraits, so strong is the resemblance between actors and historical figures. The extraordinary refinement in understanding the decoration and costumes is without precedent in American cinema, for it shows how the court integrated elements from the past (medieval tapestries for instance) in their living interiors, and it is these elements that disappear completely form later Hollywood historical movies when period films meant going into that particular epoch at the expense of all others and exclusively showing 'the historical' present, at best, and at worst recreating the period in an exagerated or ridiculous manner that made no sense at all.

The attention to detail is unsurpassed, particularly in the Babylonian scenes where the recreation of architecture, interiors, war scenes an elaborate crowd coordination is baffling. Not all of it is accurate, granted, (the elephant columns for example) but the general effect most definitly is, to the point where at times we almost feel we are witnessing a documentary.
The film is also very progressive and advanced for its time in many unsuspecting ways, and it also points out how contemporary mores are actually more provincial that we would like to acknowledge:  The harem scenes in Babylon would probably get an X-rating today, for although there is nothing shown that is lewd, there is certainly a strong erotic languor and an accurate depiction of physical desire that is strongly suggested by the actors and actresses in their half nakedness. These would get at least an R now, and it makes one clearly understand how film rating is really a vestige of an archaic censorship that is completely out of place in contemporary society.

More importantly, the depiction of a pagan universe is accurate in portraying a lack of prejudice for gay sexuality,  is also suggested here in harem scenes between the beautiful women of the king. Furthermore, the parting kiss between Belshazzar and his general, close to the end of the invasion scene, would be unthinkable in a popular blockbuster of today,where producers would be worrying endlessly about the loss of revenue that could occur from possible criticism. Yet in the film it is not only totally natural as a farewell salutation, but charged with a powerful homoerotic beauty that is an integral part of the pagan reality that Christian culture has been trying to obliterate, distort or hide for centuries.
The movie is amongst many things, an excellent attack on religious hypocrisy and fanaticism, and as such it is no wonder it would be controversial. To paraphrase the great Moliere, who discovered so many centuries ago, when he staged his Tartuffe, a play about a pious hypocrite, and found out  how powerful and malicious this crowd could be, he proceeded to note in the introduction to the published edition ""hypocrites are most prone to furiously attact my play, because they will lose their jobs if they are exposed""  This expos on hypocrites, is best illustrated in the contemporary tale, where a group of hideous and obviously frustrated and embittered women set out on a mission to ""elevate"" the poor and are effective only in diminishing their quality of life,  and also in causing lower pay for the workers, strikes and other negative effects, not to mention taking away the child of our heroine and confining the baby to an institution,  for no other valid reason than their inaccurate, yet prejudiced perception of her. Griffith had the courage to attack this vermin and shows he is a master at depicting the shades and nuances of these creatures that destroy while trying ""to do good"" which is to them, mostly an entertainment and/or an outlet for their perverse energy and vanity.
I disagree with those who consider Griffith sentimental. He depicts affection and feelings accurately within the conventions of his time, which were still for the most part, those of stage actors in the 19th Century. Part of the greatness of the movie is precisely in opening the window to the complexity of human existance at any point in history through the way those feelings are depicted.
There is as much tenderness and love in the relationship between Belshazzar and his princess as there is hatred and ambition in the High Priest. The malice of the intriguing French court is contrasted with the purity and innocence of the young girl ""Brown eyes', and the vice and criminality of The Musketeer of the People and his love interest, who shoots him in a fit of jealousy,  is a strong contrast to The Boy and The Dear One.
Finally it should be noted that Griffith was prophetic in his understanding of social tendencies in America. Within three years of the release of the movie, America entered the fiasco of prohibition,  which never eradicated alcoholism or its societal effects, yet was extremely successful at enriching, developing and promoting organized crime.",1246406400,7,8208,5.040560471976401
373193,4,6301826558,"D. W. Griffith established the parameters of success and failure in commercial cinema. If ""The Birth of a Nation"" represented the pioneering director's breakthrough, ""Intolerance"" (1916) was his undoing  a costly epic with limited box-office appeal. Griffith's flawed masterpiece influenced the Russian cinema of Eisenstein and Pudovkin through its innovative use of editing and montage, yet unknowingly paved the way for Hollywood filmmakers to create their own ""delusions of grandeur."" Though uneven, ""Intolerance"" proved a visually stunning and, at times, fascinating achievement. In terms of spectacle, ""The Fall of Babylon"" segment was a work of art. ""The Mother and the Law"" also succeeded as a contemporary, humanistic drama reminiscent of ""A Corner in Wheat."" If Griffith focused solely on the two stories, ""Intolerance"" might have surpassed ""The Birth of the Nation.""  Unfortunately, he did not comprehend that less is more. The undeveloped Christ and Huguenot segments could have been jettisoned, thus resulting in a tighter and more controlled drama. Worse still, the director's unnecessary reliance on pretentious, flowery title cards hindered the narrative flow and  upset the film's visual rhythm. Griffith now seemed out of touch with his initial audience, who were lukewarm in their response.

Intolerance follows four different story lines. A modern one concerning ""do-gooders"" and the poor, the fall of Babylon, The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and the trial and crucifixtion of Jesus. All of these based somehow on the theme of intolerance for something, most notably that of religious differences.

This movie is not for those who need a lot of plot to keep them interested. It's fairly straightforward. And since it's a silent silm many may be bored by it. But it's something to give a change. It's a classic that shouldn't be missed.",1232582400,5,821,4.655172413793103

The film tells the story of a modern couple who are impoverished and unable to take care of their child, the Babylonian defeat to the Persians and a death to a culture and the St. Bartholomew Massacres in France where Catholics killed Huguenots in a religious riot.  The stories can be overwhelming and most interesting is the modern story but it is a good movie and artfully done.

373196,5,6301826558,"This silent film by director D.W. Griffith is well known to serious movie buffs and historians, but not to today's general public. I doubt that a lot of people these days would have the patience to sit through a film that contained three hours of silence. Nevertheless, the film's technical innovations inspired filmmakers in the 1920's and later, particularly in Russia and Japan. It also inspired filmmakers in the U.S., including Cecil B. DeMille and King Vidor. For this reason, and for other reasons, ""Intolerance"" is an important film.

The film's four interwoven stories, set in four different historical eras, are tied together thematically by the subject of ""intolerance"", a word which could be accurately interpreted today as ""oppression"", ""injustice"", ""hate"", ""violence"", and mankind's general inhumanity.

Griffith's narrative structure, though innovative, is uneven, because he gives more screen time to two of the four stories (the ""modern"" and the ""Babylonian""). Equal time for three stories, thus deleting the fourth, might have worked better.

To me, the Babylonian story is the most interesting one because of its more complete coverage, and because of its elaborate costumes and spectacular sets. Even though there is no script, the viewer can easily discern the plot, which suggests that some of today's films might be just as effective, or more so, if screenwriters would downsize the dialogue.

What ""Intolerance"" offers most of all to contemporary viewers is a sense of perspective. Someone once said that despite the enormous advances in technology, society itself has advanced not at all. That may be true. In the eighty plus years since the film was released, technical advances in film-making have been obvious and impressive.

  2. The ""Judean"" era (circa 27 AD) recounts how intolerance led to the crucifixion of Jesus.
  3. The French Renaissance (1572) tells of the failure of the Edict of Toleration that led to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.

I am bringing a postmodern sensibility to this 1916 film, but although this film frustrated viewers when it was originally released (film historian David Cook suggests that audiences found its four separate story lines too hectic to follow), it seems right in line with today's multi-tasking world.  Is this a flawed film?  In some respects yes.  The film takes place in four different eras but is really only interested in exploring two of them (the present day and ancient Babylon).  There are plenty of intertitles but they're not always helpful.  Griffith's notion of _Intolerance_ doesn't seem very stable, and halfway through the film one realizes that Griffith himself perhaps didn't exactly know what he wanted to say.  And then there's Griffith's stubbornness.  Too many people wrongly read this film as Griffith's apology for the brilliant but bigoted _The Birth of a Nation_, but that is untrue.  _Intolerance_ is Griffith's thick-headed, angry response to the critics who (rightly) attacked _Birth_ as bigoted.  Despite these flaws, however, _Intolerance_ is a dazzling film.  I am not at all surprised that _Intolerance_, more than _The Birth of a Nation_, inspired early Soviet cinema pioneers like Eisenstein.

Each viewer will have to decide for himself or herself.  This movie came out after the well-know ""Birth of a Nation,"" which put a positive face on the Ku Klux Klan and exhibits racist sentiments.  This movie has a far different orientation, suggesting that intolerance has been the bane of human existence from early on.

He attempts to support this claim by juxtaposing four distinct episodes, in each of which intolerance is at the heart of conflict. The earliest (chronologically) is set in Jerusalem and focuses on the crucifixion of Jesus; next was a stunning portrayal focusing on ancient Babylon (one can scarcely imagine the lavish sets constructed for this scene); persecution of the Huguenots in 16th century Paris; the most recent episode occurs in his era and focuses on labor-management strife.

The scenes are separate, but he cuts between them.  Sometimes this can be confusing; sometimes it is powerful.

Intolerance tends to win out more often than not, but the emotional impact of the various stories is considerable.

This is a sprawling story, somewhat overblown, probably too optimistic about defeating intolerance.  But, all of that said, it is a powerful cinematic statement by D. W. Griffith.",1198281600,,1372,5.053333333333334

373292,5,6301826558,"D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth Of A Nation,"" filmed the year before ""Intolerance,"" is a much better-known film, but this depiction of four stories, illustrating the intolerance of people for those unlike them throughout history, cuts a wider swath. In many ways it is one of the most remarkable films ever made.

 I believe that the oft-repeated bromide that Griffith made ""Intolerance"" to ""atone"" for the perceived anti-black prejudice and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan in ""The Birth Of A Nation"" is simply wishful thinking on the part of many liberals. Griffith in fact saw nothing inaccurate or unfair about the earlier film, and made the 1916 blockbuster as an answer to what he perceived as the intolerance of his critics.

 The acting in ""Intolerance"" is, of course, somewhat dated (affer all, the film is 91 years old), but the movie nevertheless packs an emotional wallop.

 Most visually appealing is the Babylonian story, with sets that are jaw-droppingly huge and impressive representing the walls of the ancient city, and various statutes and other structures. The actors in those scenes literally look like ants in the master shots, totally dwarfed by the sets which rival the tall buildings existing today in many cities.

 As a matter of fact, the Babylonian sequence alone would justify the colorization of this film. It would have to be done with great care, of course, to guarantee that copies of the original black and white work were preserved. But re-photographing every frame of the film to produce a brand-new negative has been done before on other movies. It would be quite a job, but it would be possible.

373293,4,6301826558,"Is ""Intolerance "" a great film ? Of course...who would dare to say otherwise...? But..I found it very hard going to sit through..and I am a fan of silent films. Can anyone please just slap ""the dear one""..viewing a film with the devine Clara Bow just 10 years later makes you realize how far women progressed in the mind of film makers...what a breath of fresh air!

Anyway....for all its spectacle and artistic invention the message film ""Intolerance"" is a big bulky piece of furniture in the living room of movie history...not really enjoyable but ""de rigeur"" for every film fan worth that name. For all its political incorrectness(that's putting it mildly) ""Birth of a nation "" is, surprisingly,  still a far more enjoyable film than ""intolerance""...drenched in reprehensible racism but it still works as an involving story , and so it is much more accesible to modern audiences.

I do know that watching a silent film asks of modern audiences an effort of mind and concentration..but the rewards are many ...at its best it is like enjoying a heavenly piece of classical music or a fine painting....but it can also be escapist fun in truly gorgeous sepia tones.

""Intolerance "" however is a sermon....and a long and heavy one at that...you will find the cathedral it is given in vast and overwelming but ultimately uninvolving and cold.

If you are already experienced in viewing silent movies it is a must see film at any rate.

If this is going to be your first silent movie : think again....it may put you off from ever seeing one again. Better start with Clara Bow, Douglas Fairbanks or even a lovely Erich Von Stroheim monstrosity !",1168646400,3,1640,4.757042253521127
373294,5,6301826558,"'Intolerance' is a passionate antiwar statement... It has long been considered the artistic peak of the early silent films...

Of the pacifist films produced in the United States, Griffith's ""Intolerance' is undoubtedly the best, despite its failure to capture the authentic atmosphere of the war...

Griffith had in mind a vast theme-the age-old struggle against intolerance, or 'love's struggle through the ages...' The film showed how self-appointed 'uplifters' throughout history hypocritically destroy true love and happiness in the name of religion, patriotism or justice...

Griffith's innovative but highly complex plot structure had four separate episodes, three historic - the fall of Babylon, the Crucifixion and the St. Batholomew's Eve Massacre - and one modern... The effect of the war on two young lovers living in a small French village occupied by the invading German forces... All are cross-cut and interwoven, leading to a final grand finale of man's inhumanity to man... We must turn to Godard to find a modern equivalent of what Griffith was attempting to do with cinema...

In Graffith's words, 'the stories begin like four currents looked at from a hilltop. At first the four currents flow apart, slowly and quietly. But as they flow, they grow nearer and nearer together, and faster an faster, until in the end, in the last act, they mingle in one mighty river of expressed emotion.'

As a piece film 'Intolerance' marks the extreme advance of screen art... But as innovator in film making, its effects are still with us...",1167609600,,1547,5.196787148594377
373295,4,6301826558,"`Intolerance' is made up of four stories: 2 feature length (The Modern Tale and The Babylonian Tale) and 2 shorts (The Nazarene and French Tale). The only story of any worth though is The Modern Tale, which has some truly great images. The remaining tales are all about set and costume design and nothing else. Clearly we can see this would go on to influence other epic picture directors like Cecil B. DeMille. It would be hard to imagine films like `The Ten Commandments' (1956, DeMille); `Lawrence Of Arabia' (1962, Lean); `Cleopatra' (1963, Mankiewicz) or even Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars without it, but because you do it first doesn't necessarily make it good.

What `Intolerance' is remembered for is it's cross-cutting between the four tales. This was a new idea because it's cutting between events thousands of years apart in order to show parallel thematic ideas and not to parallel events. The cutting towards the end speeds up dramatically. All this of course would have a huge influence Soviet montage directors like Eisenstein as well as Pudovkin and Dovzhenko. Welles, Godard and Coppola could also be said to draw ideas from `Intolerance': just see films like Citizen Kane (1941) and The Godfather II (1974), which freely cuts between different periods.

The best thing about this film is the Modern Tale and it's structure, the rest is just epic film-making of gargantuan proportions. The problem I had is that I failed to see how the title `Intolerance' applied to the film. Griffith would have been better to re-release `Birth Of A Nation' (1915) with this title because the previous film clearly had an intolerant message. All Griffith is doing here is trying to dig himself out of a moral hole. So I believe that this is an important film in terms of the development of narrative structure, and therefore a must-see for film students, but not necessarily a good film.",1167436800,2,1892,4.872670807453416

Intolerance is NOT in black & white, it is in color, or rather tints, restored in dozens and dozens of shades that enhance the mood of each scene.

373297,5,6301826558,"D W Griffith's silent film from 1916 about how intolerance has worked against love and charity throughout history, is an awe-inspiring classic. Considering the budget, the cast, and the ambitious attempt to alternate between four stories with different characters within different periods of history, it's no wonder it's labelled as a 'colossal spectacle'. It is this film, plus 'The Birth of a Nation', that shows the extent of what D W Griffith was capable of.

The film contains a modern story of meddling social reformers who claim to be working for the 'uplift of humanity', a French story of the St Bartholomew massacre, the persecution against Jesus Christ and a story of the downfall of ancient Babylon. While this may be a complex and demanding film, D W Griffith is able to masterfully swing in and out of each story while maintaining a sense of coherence and interest for the entire film. The acting is great, the sets are incredible and the musical score is dramatic and appropriate. The film never loses momentum, and its message has never dated.

The amount of footage that was shot for this amazing film amounted to a running time of about eight hours, but was heavily cut down to around three. There are however, a few different editions of the film, and some go for slightly longer. Lillian Gish, who features as the woman rocking the cradle, famously claimed that the film should have been kept at it's original running time. An impossibility for a feature film, but it certainly would have been interesting to see footage that is now lost forever.

It boggles the mind at how D W Griffith was able to create films like this in the early days of cinema. He was one of the most gifted filmmakers  who has ever lived. He made some films good films, but this was one of his ultimate achievements.

Amazingly though, 'Intolerance' was mostly ignored on its release. And even more outrageously, was not even given a place in the entire list of the top 100 greatest American films. Realistically, you would have a solid case if you were to argue that Intolerance should be placed in the top 20, or even the top 10.

Not many view silent films these days, but 'Intolerance' deserves to be seen.",1142899200,6,2205,4.714285714285714
373398,5,6301826558,"D.W. Griffith is commonly known as the man who revolutionized movies and movie storytelling. His seminal 1915 epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION was also, in many ways, the birth of movies as an art form and as a business. Always the technical innovator, Griffith was the first to experiment with film technique in order to enhance his storytelling, and his innovations---medium close-ups, crosscutting, etc.---are indispensable to moviemakers today.

But there is more to Griffith than technical innovation, and there are parts of his 1916 silent epic INTOLERANCE that---more so than in THE BIRTH OF A NATION---remind me of some of his old Biograph shorts, in its intimate scale, pacifism, and concern for the human condition. As the main director at the old Biograph film company, Griffith was known for making shorts that placed marginalized working-class folks at the dramatic center of things, and treating his relatively lower-class characters with sensitivity and respect. That sensibility resurfaces vividly in one of the four stories in INTOLERANCE, involving the Dear One (Mae Marsh), whose husband is wrongly jailed, and whose baby is taken away by misguided Uplifters who consider her a bad mother. There's no derision in Griffith's attitude toward the working-class characters in this modern story: if anything, Griffith spouts his venom at the ruthless employers and reformers, who either care nothing for their workers or never take working class problems seriously, in spite of their agreeable-on-the-surface rhetoric.

But that is just one story out of four that Griffith tries to tell in one 3-hour cinematic package in INTOLERANCE. The other stories show Griffith trying to overreach, to go beyond what he achieved in THE BIRTH OF A NATION and tell even grander stories, and explore the grander theme of ""love's struggle through the ages.""

That's why I think INTOLERANCE is, even more than THE BIRTH OF A NATION, the most representative film of D.W. Griffith: it has all the technical and narrative experimentation that he attempts in NATION, but it is also balanced with compelling personal drama of the type that he made as a Biograph director (and which was perhaps stunted by the racist elements in NATION).

It's not perfect---not at all. Griffith's attempt at telling four  stories at once doesn't necessarily work; through his editing, he tries to cleverly connect the stories together smoothly, but in the end it still comes off as four stories told at once. And I can't really take INTOLERANCE seriously as a deep exploration of intolerance through the centuries, since none of the stories ever really rise above melodrama, and Griffith gets awfully preachy with his message at times. And yet there are still things to marvel at here: the awesome siege of Babylon, the last-minute rescues at the film's climax, Griffith's flexible use of the squarish frame. It may be trite as a message movie, but it's certainly exhilarating to watch as one of the great follies of American movies.

INTOLERANCE was meant to be a response to the cries of racism that haunted the popular success of THE BIRTH OF A NATION. Unfortunately, it was so demanding for audiences in 1916 that it became a great failure, and Griffith never really recovered from it. However, history tells a different story: INTOLERANCE lives on to this day as a movie as seminal in its importance in movie history as NATION, and it is still as awe-inspiring as ever in its sheer ambition. This is required viewing for any self-respecting film buff.",1132790400,4,3526,5.081174438687392
373399,5,6301826558,"Griffith constitutes to the American Cinema the most remarkable director ever born and in my personal list he is among the five Greats . After him we can name Welles, Ford, Wilder, Capra and a long etc. But this giant understood the enormous relevance about the overtaking and the expressive power of this relatively new device. With the only exception of Giovanni Pastrone in Italy (Cabiria nights), till that moment any other filmmaker had such level of commitment, ambition and distinction at the moment of handling a camera to ignite the screen in such way.

Griffith was a herald of the Cinema. His transcendence has elevated the ambits of the artistic barriers to become a continuous matter of analysis and discussion around the master classes and far beyond. He inspired to a remarkable crowd of future directors - Stroheim was perhaps, the most immediate director.

250 chariots, 15.000 people support an intense script perfectly articulated where the injustice prevails far beyond a specific age.",1128038400,,1005,5.121951219512195
373400,3,6301826558,"There is no doubt that this film is important. It is one of the first great epics directed by the master D W Griffith. It features big names from Griffith films: Constance Talmadge as the slave girl, Mae Marsh as the ""dear one"", and Bobby Harron as her husband. The massive sets were actually built for the film and the message of the perils of being intolerant is still applicable to today's society.

However, the film itself lacks continuity and does not hold one's interest well. The story is told in four parts that randomly switch back and forth in no particular sequence. Although the theme of intolerance permeates each section, the events in each are very different from the next. Watching this film is like reading four different but similar books by the same author at the same time, one chapter from one book then another chapter from the other book, then a few pages from the other book, back to the first book for a few pages, and then to the last book for a chapter. Two of the scenarios, that of Babylon and that of the ""modern"" (or modern for the time in which the film was made) age, get more attention than the others. The film is terribly confusing and difficult to watch; what makes it worse is that it is three hours long.

This silent film features attributes that most silent films have: tinting and a score. Neither are outstanding, but each fulfill their role.

This DVD includes extra features, many photographs and alternate takes of certain shots from foreign versions, which are accompanied by a rich volume of text. For those interested in the history of the film, this supplement is highly useful. However, the format will probably bore others and encourage them to skip this part.",1127865600,3,1713,4.646864686468647
373401,5,6301826558,"Intolerance is one of those rare films that stretched the boundaries of  the medium of film. It is  a sweeping epic that contains four stories  each tragic each highlighting the intolerance man has for his brothers  through out the ages. Although a long movie (3hours) we find ourselves totally immersed in it and mesmerized by it. It is not just a movie but an experience.

Its themes  are as relevant today as they were then as among other topics it tackles  it shows how  people  mistrust each other  because of  superficial things such as difference in race and in religion and how we carelessly blunder into war. And in the end how the character flaws of just one individual can bring the collapse of an entire civilization.

The sets  of the movie  were massive and unheard of in their day. When the movie was made it was made on a closed set and much secrecy surrounded the project but people could not ignore the set of Babylon as it began to rise  over  Los Angeles.

The film is not perfect as some of the performances in the epic vary in quality the sets and story lines astound and it still stands as one of the most ambitious movies ever made and sets the bar  for the film epic.

A handful of separate stories are joined by the repeating image of Lillian Gish rocking a cradle. It is a symbol of nurturing a mother and the hope that comes with each new generation. It is a symbol of the passage of time with the endless parade of carnage through out history contrasted with the fact that we all come into the world in the same way. It is a very moving and powerful image.

The story of the intolerance of man is told through a handful of stories - the fall of Babylon, the crucifixion of  Jesus, the persecution of the Huegenots and the (then) present day meddling of well meaning  social workers.

Although Griffith hammers away at the theme of intolerance and its destructive consequences the last story to conclude involves a man falsely convicted, and is now about to be executed and whose life literally hangs by a thread (or rather several, though an apparatus where a group of men  each cut away at a string  not knowing which one will trip the door to the gallows) and is at the last minute (after  a frantic car race to the warden) spared. In this way Griffith offers the viewer a glimmer of hope that the cycle of intolerance will someday be broken.

One wonders if the subject matter and title has something to do with the reaction D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation "" received. This  movie plainly  shows  Griffith's  stance on the evils of racism.

 One cannot help but think that the movie is making a political statement as well as during the time of the movie's release  W.W. I was raging in Europe.

A great spectacle as well as a thoughtful meditation.

In my book it is one of the top fifty films of all time.

Highly recommended,

373403,5,6301826558,"I have long been a great admirer of this wonderful film, and am always interested in the latest VHS or DVD editions that are made available. The print quality on this Delta release is surprisingly good, making it an excellent value for the curious collector desiring an introduction to D. W. Griffith's 1916 cinema masterpiece. There are several different edited versions of Intolerance that have been produced over the last few years for video, each slightly unique in terms of editing and emissions/additions of key scenes. This Delta DVD version is no exception, with some interesting fadeouts to a couple of scenes that, in some prints, cut abruptly to the next shot. The music that accompanies the film sounds as if it was pieced together from pre-recorded sources, but it works well enough and it's apparent some real effort was used to match the music to the mood of the images. As to the film itself, Intolerance is a brilliant and powerful milestone in the history of cinema. D. W. Griffith wove four separate stories together, each from a different period of history, to illustrate the theme of man's inhumanity to man. The results were certainly startling to 1916 audiences, and no less impressive today. Superb performances abound in all four stories, most notably Mae Marsh and Robert Harron in the Modern Story, Constance Talmadge and Elmer Clifton in the Babylonian Story, Howard Gaye in the Nazarene Story, and Margery Wilson, Eugene Pallette and Josephine Crowell in the French Story. The beautiful repeated shot of Lillian Gish as the Woman Who Rocks The Cradle, a device linking the individual stories, has become an enduring icon of the Silent Cinema. And of course, the magnificent sets of Ancient Babylon are among the most wonderful ever created for a moving picture. My recommendation to first-time viewers of Intolerance would be to try this version out, and then pursue the newly restored Kino version for a more definitive print. The cover art for Delta's release is also interesting, using vintage advertising art for the film that focuses on a crucial scene for Mae Marsh in the Modern Story. All in all, a very decent job in bringing a landmark film to the home screen.",1079049600,25,2199,4.929919137466308
373404,5,6301826558,"This is indeed the most powerful film I have ever seen. No other film since has matched this one in its power and accuracy. Though some parts are indeed imaginery, the whole thing is accurate to the last detail. D.W Griffith was a master of recreating history and he shows the powerful portrayals of Babylon (the largest set in history and the most impressive indeed), the Cruxification of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Massacres, the Revolutions... and all tied together with the simple and divine image of the Virgin Mary (played beautifully by Lillian Gish) rocking the cradle of Our Lord. I swear, if anyone found fault with this movie, I'd be highly offended and shocked. This movie is just brilliant and has very few faults in it. Imagine a director in 1915 creating a film of such scope and power and moral, it is truly a feat! No film director ever has portrayed the same power and moral and beauty as D.W. Griffith. I just sat through the whole film (4 hours of it) and I didn't even eat or sleep or drink, it was totally mind consuming and I enjoyed it totally!! :-D If D.W. Griffith were alive today, sure he would be rioted against for his views on race, but I think he would be regarded as the one who recreated God's beautiful Earthly history. It is truly a powerful film with a wonderful message, that out of all times of horror and strife, there is but one person to turn to for divine intervention, Our God himself. Bravo D.W. Griffith! I know God is proud of the work you did!",1062806400,9,1491,4.445255474452555
373405,4,6301826558,"Many of the reviewers here rightly praise Griffith's well-deserved credit for his technical achievements.  Others criticize him for a poorly constructed film.  The fact of the matter is that, for 1916, this film is an incredible feat.  The first American big-budget extravaganza, it followed closely in the steps of other big multi-reel films in vogue at the time(Griffith's own Birth of a Nation, and others coming out of Italy).  The spectacle alone makes this film worth a look, but viewers should try to contextualize it.  There was a great expectation across the nation to what would come from Griffith after the amazing--and incendiary racist-film, Birth of a Nation.
What is Intolerance really a metaphor for anyway?  Griffith was fighting off attempts by legislators to regulate or censor the motion picture industry.  An anti-censorship booklet released by Griffith in 1916 suggests he continued to respond to ""moral reformers"" even as he assembled Intolerance.  In fact, his film is an attempt to address these reformers while simultaneously opining on nothing less than the historic importance of the film media itself.
Intolerance is really about a nation's cultural memory and Griffith's attempt to offer a totalizing, yet entertaining version of it.  His belief that if we were educated on the subject of past ""sins of hate, hypocrisy and intolerance"" through the magic of film that we could inoculate ourselves against war, capital punishment and other evils.  He argued that film was a better education than traditional education.  To quote the master: ""Six moving pictures would give students more knowledge of the world than they have obtained from their entire study.""  Such an understanding is, of course, nave and dangerous.
Griffith was caught in a double-bind.  In order to fight the censors he needed to simultaneously argue that his epics (like Birth and Intolerance) were a kind of filmed truth, yet the construction of this ""truth"" should only be the purview of the director.  Griffith's logic is dangerously flawed.  Birth of a Nation is hardly true history.  In fact its racist vision of blacks fanned the flames of racial hatred in whites and surely accounted for many more lynchings than if the film had not been made.  What's missing from his vision is how truth is arrived at:  certainly not from a lone man's dictates.  We have another word for that...
Intolerance is worth viewing because it is a wonderful illustration of the limitations of film.  It's a simple morality tale blown up to epic-and phantasmagoric-proportions.  It's greatest weakness is the cross-cutting between the four time-periods, and the attempt to narrate all history, yet this is precisely what makes the film interesting.  The failure to arrive at an overarching metaphor that somehow spans history and unites us with our past points to Griffith's own flawed vision.  It reminds us-contrary to Griffith's own advice-that understanding history in all its irresolvable complexity is absolutely essential.",1022716800,36,3012,5.242171189979123
373406,4,6301826558,"Intolerance is a complicated picture.  For the first hour I'll admit to being completely at a loss.  Griffith throws four stories at the audience with dozens and dozens of characters and expects us to follow it.  He doesn't slow down to explain.  He's like a really bad teacher who expects you to do all the work alone.  So I'm trying to understand whether Mae Marsh's admirer is a good or bad guy (It's always one of the other in a Griffith movie).  Though he requests to be left into her room and sex of any kind is usually an act of the villian in Griffith's pictures, I came to the conclusion that he was on the good side.  I'm questioning whether the old woman who laments her lost youth is a hero or villian.  Villian!  Or whether the ""effeminate"" character will have much of a role.  He didn't.  I don't know why he was even introduced.  While trying to figure out all these characters I was incessantly rocked by Lillian Gish and her never stopping cradle.  Which story was she part of?  Surely Gish, usually the heroine, will have a bigger part in one of the stories.  She didn't.
And yet somehow, through all this confusion, the movie comes together in the second act and works.  It's climax is brilliantly sustained.  The old cliche of saving the innocent man from being murdered is used here and surprisingly manages to find some suspense.  The Babylonian scenes are saved by the enchanting mountain girl whose death is tragic in its symbolism.  The other stories, in France and Judea, are quickly passed over.  The Judaen conclusion ends with Christ's crucifixion in a very far shot.  We can't see anything Mr. Griffith.
Confusion aside, once this film starts to work, it works brilliantly.  Griffith was a master of sustained tension if nothing else.  Watch out for the knives over the string that will release the noose on the hangman!  I was surprised I got so involved in a silent, especially after watching Griffith's Birth of a Nation which really only succeeds now, as a historical document.
