7268884,5,B00YT9ISU2,"Great nostalgia, predecessor to NYPD Blue.",1455321600,,42,6.166666666666667
7268885,4,B00YT9ISU2,Thank God for Norm Buntz. He was a fresh of breath air. The 5th season was getting a little too Falcon Crest for me. By far the 5th was the weakest season. But when HSB is good it's the best and when it's bad and still better than 99% of the crap out there.,1452988800,,257,3.7777777777777777
7268886,5,B00YT9ISU2,Great series,1447891200,,12,5.5
7268887,3,B00YT9ISU2,"A great series begins its inevitable decline with this season.  The plots and hoary and stale, the characters offer little that is new.  Few and far between are the series that keep their momentum after three or four seasons - sameness sets in.  There are only so many plots, so many situations characters can find themselves in, so many late night conversations between Furillo and Davenport, so many anxious moments watching Belker about to bear his teeth or Renko to get red in the face.",1447804800,,490,4.741176470588235
7268888,5,B00YT9ISU2,Exactly as advertised and I was very pleased with it.,1446940800,,53,4.4
7268889,5,B00YT9ISU2,"this has to be one of the best tv shows of all time, this set the standard for all other police shows. I see a little bit of this show in most of the successful tv shows today. I would recommend this series to anybody, its good tv",1445731200,,230,3.8125
7268890,5,B00YT9ISU2,great show. glad they continued the dvds.,1444608000,,41,5.0
7268891,5,B00YT9ISU2,I love this program and plan to get all of them,1444176000,3,47,3.3636363636363638
7268892,3,B00YT9ISU2,"For those not indoctrined to the great Hill Street Blues, you deserve to expose yourself to it.
By the Sixth season, things became a bit stale. Not having its Creator around (Steven Bochco) certainly didn't help matters. Still worth a watch, with all the acting talent around. Enjoy!",1441670400,3,283,4.916666666666667
8719124,5,B00YT9ISU2,Just one word to sum up this season. GREAT!!!!!.,1518652800,,48,4.444444444444445
8719125,5,B00YT9ISU2,Gift for my sister.  Fast ship and nice and clean new item.,1511654400,,59,3.9166666666666665
8719126,5,B00YT9ISU2,This is a series worth watching if you never have.  It's a campy fun police procedural,1496966400,,86,4.375
8719127,5,B00YT9ISU2,Good picture and arrived on time,1494892800,,32,4.5
8719128,5,B00YT9ISU2,Great last season,1493164800,,17,5.0
8719129,5,B00YT9ISU2,"Except for the episode involving the breakdown of Lt. Hunter 'underling' Ballentine ""My name is Jack!"" (oh brother, he ends up meow-growling like a cat -- not kidding) HILL STREET'S sixth Season is as good as tv gets.
The flashback scenes of Joyce Davenport (Hamel) and ""Pizza Man"" Furillo (Travanti) are nothing short of priceless.
Season six is famous for a couple of startling shootings.
Dennis Franz is back as Bad Sal, er, I mean appearing for the 'first time' as Norman ""Bunts"" for Season 6.
An episode with young cop Mykel T. Williamson (from Forrest Gump) is worth pointing out:  A gun is planted on a ""clean shoot""; and Belker is learning how to cook ""Meth"" as part of his undercover work on same day he's supposed to marry Robin (Lisa Sutton).  Great episode.

Just wanna' give a shout out to two underrated recurring characters on The Hill played by Lisa Sutton and George Wyner. ""Robin"" (Sutton) is Belker's main squeeze and Wyner the likeable lawyer ""Irwin"" who offered Joyce Davenport the promotion.  They were around for pretty much the entire show and were effectively good without getting much credit.
HILL STREET SEASON 6 another 5 star job well done.",1492128000,2,1169,4.800995024875622
8719130,5,B00YT9ISU2,best cop show in the history of television,1475280000,,42,4.375
8719131,5,B00YT9ISU2,"Watching the entire 7 seasons and it is an interesting progression and reflection of the multiple problems happening then and related to now.  All of the characters are memorable and each season they seem to bring the character more alive and well rounded.  Interesting that the signature slogal ""Let's be Careful out there"" was only the first 3 seasons until the actor sadly passed away in real life.",1473033600,2,401,4.882352941176471
8719132,4,B00YT9ISU2,Last god season.  Lost some steam with Joe Coffey gone and Dennis Franz was far superior in his next outing for Bochco.,1458000000,,119,4.409090909090909
8719133,5,B00YT9ISU2,great,1457654400,,5,5.0
