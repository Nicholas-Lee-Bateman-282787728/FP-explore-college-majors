8585898,5,B00CSW087I,I watched Casper as a child myself (60 yrs ago) and it was one of my favorite cartoons then.  I was so thrilled to find it again so I bought it for my 7 year old grandson.  He has watched this a million times and brings it with him when he comes to stay with Nana!,1400371200,,264,3.6964285714285716
