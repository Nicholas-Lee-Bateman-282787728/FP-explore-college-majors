8430802,5,6301912004,"The five stars are for the MPI's commitment to release a wonderful document of soviet propaganda against the Chinese after the split in the 60's. ""we use to be brothers and we could be again if Mao is sided apart"" is the message the soviets launched to the chinese. An angry and bitter reccount of the way the former communist giants confronted their disputes on economical, ideological and geopolitical fields. It is not for the general interest, as require some background of the historical facts about the sino soviet split. But for scholarls and sinologist is quite interesting and something helpful in the academical field. Unfortunately the other side of the coin, the chinese version of the ""we use to be brothers and we could be again if Stalin (or Kruschev, or Brezhnev) is sided apart"" is not available for a wide range of consumers, nevertheles that it exists. May be MPI can surprise us soon.",993859200,3,904,4.801282051282051
