7977493,2,B00007KK1C,"I already have CASUAL SEX and sort of partially like it (the movie that is), so that adds me to the list of those somewhat perplexed by this two-pack offer. Since some reviews were written, saying that COLD COMFORT FARM is offered only in this two-pack, it seems now amazon.com has started offering it separately, and that is an improvement. If a (possibly apocryphal) story that I heard is true, this isn't the first time that CASUAL SEX has been inconveniently coupled with another movie. According to the story, a guy went to a video store, hoping to rent CASUAL SEX and also NUTS, the latter starring Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfus. He asked the clerk ""Do you have NUTS?"" She responded, ""No."" He asked, ""Do you have CASUAL SEX?"" and she answered, ""Not with anyone who had to ask if I have nuts!"" Anyhow I've gotten into re-viewing COLD COMFORT FARM, after I saw the recently-released ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. The latter convinced me that Kate Beckinsale (pronounced Kate book-INNS-a-lee) is an actress worthy of  a second look. She was captivating in that most successful and faithful big-screen transfer I've seen of that Alice-In-Wonderland sequel. So now that she has name recognition to me, I'm hoping to find COLD COMFORT FARM worth a second look, on her account, especially since I saw one review that called Kate that film's ""saving grace"". My first viewing of CCF, when it was new, would make me think it NEEDED a ""saving grace"". It seemed mainly mean-spirited and unfunny to me at the time. But now with Kate Beckinsale to better appreciate and focus on, I may get out of the film what I might have missed then, and see what all the fuss is about. If I do find Kate a ""saving grace"" to the film, then I can call it worthwhile that amazon seemingly now offers the film separately for those who either already have CASUAL SEX or don't want to.",1107475200,4,1868,4.643504531722054
7977494,5,B00007KK1C,"While I agree that the packaging of these two seems really out of place, I happen to actually enjoy both of these films so it's more because the combination just doesn't make sense to me than anything else.
CCF is by far a superior film and is absolutly hilarious...""I saw something nasty in the woodshed!"" And not to mention it was my first chance to see Rufus Sewell, a simply wonderful actor. Along with Kate and all the others this is simply one of the oddest films I've ever seen.
CS is very funny to me, I saw it ages ago when it was a new film and not so dated and it was just so funny. It was my first time seeing Andrew Dice Clay and I have to say I found him funny and quite charming by the end of the film. Full of cliches but done with a sense of humor and heart I really enjoy this film.",1061942400,2,800,3.9751552795031055
7977495,5,B00007KK1C,"I have already seen the wonderful gem of a movie, Cold Comfort Farm, but will not order it from Amazon on DVD since it comes only with the stupid movie, Casual Sex.  What is Amazon thinking?!  Please offer Cold Comfort Farm as a single DVD, since it more than stands alone in quality!",1052784000,15,284,4.339622641509434
7977496,5,B00007KK1C,"I can but agree most ardently with the reviewers who wonder why on EARTH the distributors would package a quirky, stylish gem like Cold Comfort Farm with shlock like Casual Sex.  I immediately discarded the Casual Sex DVD (but not in the trash!  That would have been environmentally incorrect!  I gave it to a charitable organization with a thrift shop!) and then proceeded to relish with what wit and brio the filmmakers have rendered Stella Gibbons' classic.  It is a treat!  Thank goodness there have always been Starkadders on Cold Comfort Farm!  It bears rewatching, too:  there is always something new to discover.  Here we have Kate Beckinsale and Rufus Sewell being playful and delightful, just before each of them became the stars they are now, but let me also say that the performances of Ian McKellen, Eileen Atkins, Joanna Lumley, Sheila Burrell and Stephen Fry are perfect, every one:  they demonstrate the superb professionalism and imagination that we always expect from British actors -- AND they act as though they were having the most marvelous fun doing these parts.  All in all, a wonderful entertainment!",1049760000,18,1125,5.0
