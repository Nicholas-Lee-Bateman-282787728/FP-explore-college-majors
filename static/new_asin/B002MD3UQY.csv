3952181,1,B002MD3UQY,"I was so disappointed in this dvd.  I thought it would be a travel documentary about Norway, more of a sweeping trip through the country with a bit of history thrown in. Instead it felt very political at times with a lot of museum visits.  My husband fell asleep and we turned it off after 55 minutes. I wanted to see some cities, know where I was on a map, and see some the great scenery.  Instead, we got a lot of political commentary. All I wanted was to do some traveling for an evening :).  I have these good vhs tapes called ""The British Isles Collection"" by Questar.  They are great for plugging into a vhs player and running on a treadmill.  Each video is about 65 min and you get a lot of scenery, they show you a map of where you are, give you a bit of history and you can run through a different country in a couple of days!  THAT is what I wanted in this dvd.",1288569600,6,871,4.02906976744186
3952182,4,B002MD3UQY,"I loved this video on PBS, when I ordered it I did not know it was Bluray.
So I cannot watch it on my DVD until I get a Bluray players",1287619200,,134,3.3548387096774195
3952183,4,B002MD3UQY,"This DVD provided great knowledge of the history of the Norwegian origins. The expectation was to see mostly scenic coasts, fjords and mountains. It was greatly informative, and the pace is simple and slow. The narrative is good; the sites amaszing; and the history surprising.",1279929600,3,277,5.177777777777778
3952184,5,B002MD3UQY,"The Richard Bang Adventures use good quality cameras to record for these DVDs. The Switzerland being the best of the Adventure Group. I have all his DVD's except the new Greece Adventure and the Swiss out does all the others. Very disappointed in the Norwegian DVD - excellent scenery when you get to see it, but overshadowed by too much history! Watch the Reviews of the other Adventure DVDs on the Swiss DVD to see the Best of the others. Then decide whether to purchase the others. Best Price on Amazon.ca.",1274227200,9,509,4.604395604395604
3952185,5,B002MD3UQY,"This 60 minutes blu-ray video is very good, with clear explanations that correspond with what you are watching. Richard Bangs appears a lot, but just to say the precise words and then lets you enjoy the scene or sight, with just the right timing... and the video keeps the right rhythm all along. He (us) visit 6 cities, and let us enjoy and grasp the real street and cultural life of that amazing multicultural (historically, maybe not too much nowadays) country. Buy it... is a great travel...",1269129600,7,495,4.7011494252873565
3952186,5,B002MD3UQY,"Got the Viking Spirit? I like movies like Over America and othe documentaries. Ever since going to Disney World and visiting Norway at Epcot, have been very interested in Norway The movie is really good. You learn all about Norway and about vikings. Richard Gangs is the host and does a great job The PQ is amazing. It looks like I am really there. The water is so clear and the colors are alive Audio. This is not going to blow you away like Twister and it's not meant to be. The narration and the Norwegian music in the background really helps the experience The extras are pretty ok. Lets see you get to turn English subtitle on or off, web and order information (keep in mind this was first shown on like pbs) and you also get""also from"" which gives you a short preview of Adventures with a purpose.

Overall if you love blu ray and these type of movies this is great and at a great price.",1265155200,3,893,4.284023668639053
3952187,1,B002MD3UQY,"This was very disappointing.  Politicians were interviewed, Maori spiritualism was spread thinly on top, but in the end it was mostly bunjie jumping, boat rides, fishing, lodging, etc.  Not much scenery, a lot of talking.  ""Richard Bangs is Indiana Jones with a conscience."".  What marketing guru cooked that one up ?  The front cover shows him standing on a glacier, but most of the time he was walking city streets, in a restaurant, or looking at rooms in some hotel.",1262217600,11,469,4.8125
3952188,1,B002MD3UQY,"Long on environmental dogma and light on New Zealand geography, history and people. If you find a solar panel more interesting than natural scenery you will like this. Should of not jumped at a chance to see some of New Zealand without reading the fine print",1260057600,8,258,4.630434782608695
3952189,4,B002MD3UQY,"quality of bluray is awesome.

the title is highly misleading because they only cover Assam which is just one of the 28 states (+7 union territories), each with its own distinct culture and tourist attractions !  in other words, it covers just but a fraction of what this great country has to offer in terms of tourism.",1257638400,6,319,4.578947368421052
3952190,4,B002MD3UQY,"quality of bluray is awesome and the scenery is breathtaking.

while its commendable to note that they emphasize heavily on the echo-friendly aspects of tourism (almost seems to be the main focus and also seems to be the case with other titles from the same author), it is not obvious from the description on the product.

4 starts because it was not fully satisfying (as are some of history or travel channel's tourism documentaries) and left me wanting more. But for $10 its worth it.",1257638400,6,486,4.705882352941177
8373839,4,B002MD3UQY,The service was great. The problem was that the DVD would not work in any machine so I returned it. Have not reordered.,1505260800,,119,4.217391304347826

8373843,5,B002MD3UQY,"Very down to earth and interesting narration without being flashy.  Photography outstanding.  Truly enjoyed it, and continue to enjoy it over and over again!  Great!",1390780800,,165,5.52
8373844,3,B002MD3UQY,"Richard Bang likes to seek out locations off the beaten path. In New Zealand the only places he highlighted that are the same as other travel hosts are Franz Josef Glacier, Wellington, and the thermal Taupo region. Richard skips Milford Sound and Milford Trek along with Auckland.

This video has some great segments for those who want to know about whale watching, exploring the thermal areas, and remote places on the North and South Islands. Having traveled both islands, I was interested in his stops at some places that were not on my itinerary and to look for changes since I was there.

Richard is an environmentalist who is very passionate. For instance, he planted a tree to offset the carbon footprint from driving around the country. He also relates every experience to whatever he has chosen as a theme. This may irritate some viewers. If you have viewed the more familiar narrators (Rudy Maxa, Burt Wolf, Joseph Rosendo) videos, then Richard Bangs may add to your list of places you would like to see. Personally I thought the other narrators created more enthusiasm for vacationing in New Zealand.",1390780800,2,1111,4.873015873015873
8373845,5,B002MD3UQY,I learned a lot about Switzerland I didn't know before and enjoyed this program and it's fascinating photography so  much I have shown it to everyone I know as often as I can.  It's a wonderful way to enjoy High Definition television and sound at it's best.  The Swiss trans are famous and you get to share the views they have while traveling through the Alps.,1372032000,,360,4.424242424242424
8373846,1,B002MD3UQY,"I bought this in anticipation of my upcoming Egypt trip. You know, wan't to get hyped up :) Instead, this just put me to sleep. Waste of money. Besides, nothing compares to what you will see when you get there!",1353801600,,210,4.275
8373847,3,B002MD3UQY,"Having traveled to Switzerland and reading of the excellent quality of this blu-ray I purchased this to refresh my memory and perhaps gain some insight into Swiss culture. I feel the blu-ray quality is excellent but too much time is spent in caverns, tunnels, etc. AND most disturbing is the constant switching from summer
to winter and back again throughout the video. I couldn't get interested in the narration but, if only interested in the most beautiful scenery, well photographed in rapidly alternating seasons, buy it.",1331596800,5,525,5.116279069767442
8373848,3,B002MD3UQY,"This DVD was disappointing.  Having been to Switzerland, I had hoped for a more diverse tour.  Mr. Bangs dwells on a few areas which have been covered by many other travelers.",1312761600,7,175,4.612903225806452
