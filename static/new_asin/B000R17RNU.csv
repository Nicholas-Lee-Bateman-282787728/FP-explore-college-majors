8198277,1,B000R17RNU,"For those who are collectors of Sherlock Holmes or classic film this would probably be a good choice. For those who are like me who enjoy Sherlock and are interested in various actors who played their role it is not. Most of the movies have not been rejuvenated and the sound is terrible. It is as if you were listening to an echo chamber. The films flicker, are too dark and are sometimes noisy. Making them distracting and difficult to follow the plot. If I had not been familiar with the plots it would have been difficult to follow. It is a shame because the different takes on the same plot line could have been interesting. The old TV flicks by Ronald Howard (Leslie Howard's son) were fine. Also I am sorry to see that Peter Cushing was not included in this set.",1431043200,,769,4.384615384615385
8198278,4,B000R17RNU,"""Sherlock Holmes,"" the most renowned of all fictional detectives, was the creation of Scottish author and physician Arthur Conan Doyle. The stories were published in various British magazines beginning in 1887. Over the years Conan Doyle tried more than once to kill off the character, but public clamor made him reconsider. Doyle wrote four Holmes novels and fifty-six short stories, right up until the knighted author's death in 1930.
