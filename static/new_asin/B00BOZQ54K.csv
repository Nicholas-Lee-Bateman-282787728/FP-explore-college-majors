5663017,5,B00BOZQ54K,i wanted to understand what the natural tension between M.D.'s and D.C.'s  were.  This video was very insightful and helps dispel the myths and misunderstandings of D.C's.  Well worth watching!,1370217600,4,193,5.366666666666666
5663018,5,B00BOZQ54K,"I am very impressed with the content of ""Doctored.""  I am familiar with some of the physicians attached to and interviewed in the documentary.  The thing that I enjoy about it most is that it isn't negative, per se, about the medical community, but rather it is positive about ""alternative"" methods (most specifically chiropractic).  That said, it does expose some glaring weaknesses of our current medical health care system which everyone who participates in it needs to understand.  While medicine saves many lives every day, it is statistically the number three killer in the US as well, claiming 250,000 lives per year (B. Starfield, M.D., July 26, 2000. JAMA 284(4). pp483-485).  What this documentary does is offer an alternative to the mainstream of drugs and surgery.  It also shows how the American Medical Association has biased doctors and patients, and stifled the profession of chiropractic simply because it is a competitive system.  The film also shows many hopeless lives transformed by chiropractic, nutrition, and other ""holistic"" methods.  I like documentaries that not only expose weaknesses, but offer hope and alternatives for those who have never been exposed to the whole truth.  Highly recommended!",1369699200,198,1224,5.300518134715026
5663019,5,B00BOZQ54K,This is a must-see movie for everyone!  I'm still amazed that our healthcare system is so narrow minded and totally controlled by the AMA,1366675200,42,137,4.708333333333333
5663020,5,B00BOZQ54K,"This movie goes into what happened over the years to have our health care system (really a sick care system) become what it is today.  A worthy movie for anyone who questions the integrity and efficacy of the modern medical system.  It also gives options and benefits of effective, natural approaches to becoming healthy.",1366502400,60,321,4.925925925925926

5663025,4,B00BOZQ54K,"This tells about doctors, and the medicines they prescribe to patients, it's like a scheme, where if a patient takes a lot of medicines, and keep a person coming, then the more money the doctor makes, also the more the pharmaceutical companies get to, it's worth the money to watch this, and learning to eat right",1498003200,,313,4.607142857142857
5663026,5,B00BOZQ54K,"It takes a lot of courage to tell a doctor ""NO"" to a medicine he is prescribing.  It takes a lot of courage to seek a an alternative doctor and reject conventional medicine.  Luckily, I've been blessed with good health but the rare times I was in need of medical advice,  I have been open to other opinions.  I enjoyed the DVD  DOCTORED.  I wish everyone would see it and it will give them the courage to question and lookout side the medical profession for alternative solutions.  Conventional medicine has it's place but so do other forms of healing.  Good luck and God bless.",1496016000,,578,4.490384615384615

5663028,5,B00BOZQ54K,"I ate whole foods, no preservatives, my whole life and was always healthy, and still eat mostly raw fruits and vegetables and get plenty of exercise. However, with the stress of corporate layoffs combined with a period where I wasn't eating or sleeping enough, I ended up in the doctor's office and they said I had hypothyroidism. I took pills for 9 months which did nothing and made me sick even after going to 2 GPs and 2 Endocrinologists. I had to push for the doctors to let me do vitamin/mineral tests. They agreed to 2: I was found B-12 deficient and D deficient. They didn't even test for iodine deficiency! After 9 months of no results on my pills I paid for an iodine test myself and the lab said I was deficient. I then found a holistic doctor's book, and started his iodine supplement protocol. Another vitamin test I paid for showed I had zinc deficiency (and 4 others). According to medical research, Iodine, zinc, B-12 and vitamin D are all necessary for thyroid function. Why didn't the 4 doctors check before putting me on drugs? I am now going to a holistic doctor, and I am fixing the underlying causes. I will be getting an adrenal test to make sure that is not causing the thyroid issue, and also a body toxin test. I am already off my medication and am feeling just fine on my vitamin and mineral supplements, but we are going to be thorough and rule out all the possible causes of hypothyroid. What is sad is that I had to do the research myself before I knew to go to a holistic doctor, and by the time I did, I already knew more than the previous doctors who had treated me- in terms of actually healing permanently. This is why I decided to start watching movies like this, It has reinforced the experiences I had, and helped me to see I am not alone. And it's made me realize that there needs to be a paradigm shift from drugs that don't heal to therapies that do.",1487030400,54,1890,4.356940509915014

I was a bit confused when instead of being directed to my ""Cart"" I was directred to a page which informed me that I purchased the video and therefore was able to watch it now. I clicked on watch now button, and immediately an error message appeared: ""Digital Rights Error ... Your web browser is missing a digital rights component.""
Then, realizing that I had made an error, I attempted to cancel the order, by clicking ""cancel order"". But was denied the cancellation since allegedly I've already watched the video, but I didn't as I was not  able to download it due to a ""Digital Rights Error"", as per the message that appeared.",1513641600,2,673,4.516393442622951

I hardily recommend that everyone see it.  It is not anti-Western medicine, or anti-doctor; not at all.  Traditional physicians and the resources available are life-saving and I am very grateful for modern technology.  But there is so much more to know and understand about the human body, health, and well-being that what is being taught in medical schools.  There is SO MUCH that traditional doctors DO NOT understand.  If more physicians would respect and cooperate with non-traditional health care professionals, we would be a much healthier and happier people.",1505347200,2,722,5.059322033898305
