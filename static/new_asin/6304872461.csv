7879409,5,6304872461,What stands out the most in this episode is the strong level of commitment and pioneering spirit of this brave crew to survive any obstacle. This show should remind us all that hard work will pay off in the end. Of all of the shows seen I love this one the best due to the acting of Guy Williams who displays the heart and soul of a Man determined to keep his family alive. This show also shows the first use of the force field system and the weather station. My NICV Maintenance & Calibration Manual uses this show as the building block.
