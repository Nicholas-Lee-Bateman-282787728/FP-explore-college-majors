3026377,5,B000YDMPA6,"The movie was really great and not the stupid dating comedy it was marketed as.  It has an actual story and all of the characters really draw you into the plot.  You feel for the main character, Danny, and you really want him to succeed at the end.  This movie is a great buy!",1250380800,,276,4.074074074074074
3026378,4,B000YDMPA6,"I saw the new Star Trek a couple weeks ago and it was awesome. I believe Chris Pine will become famous now because of it. So i went and checked out his few other movies. Princess Diaries 2 and Just My Luck were ok but im not into the Disney type. Then I bought Blind Dating and was glad i did. It is a very cute movie that has heart. Its funny, cute, and sad. I found myself laughing at parts and then tearing up later. Danny (Chris Pine) is a 22yr old blind man that goes on many blind dates to find a nice girl. Its also about how he deals with being blind. Eddie Kaye Thomas plays his brother, and Jane Seymour plays his psychiatrist. Both are believeable and great for their parts. Chris Pine is the best part of this movie and very talented in this role. I'm glad I got this movie because its a nice little movie that I will watch again and again.",1243468800,2,852,4.047337278106509
3026379,5,B000YDMPA6,"You know, you don't have to be blind to enjoy this film.  If you ever were on a date where you looked at the person and wondered ""If I gave you a hundred dollars would you go away forever?"" You would enjoy this film.",1228176000,,216,3.909090909090909
3026380,3,B000YDMPA6,"By the look of the DVD cover, or the poster, you would think this was a take-off on American Pie or something, especially with Eddie Kaye Thomas in it. It's not campy or tasteless, but actually a nice story.

Danny was blind from birth, and he has a lot going for him. Great personality, great looks, but he doesn't have a woman to share it with. With the help of his brother Larry, he goes on a few (slightly overacted) dates. But, he really likes the receptionist at his doctor's office, Leeza. Danny is being tested to participate in an experimental brain operation so he can see again. But, not that many have been performed. Even though he's comfortable in his own skin, he is tired of women feeling sorry for him because he is blind. So, he is thinking of getting that operation.

Meanwhile, Leeza has a secret. Though Danny doesn't know she is Indian, and doesn't really care, she has an arranged marriage coming up, but she's confused about her feelings for her future husband. Can she break that promise to her family to be with Danny? Will she tell him that she is going to marry someone else?

It was a touching movie with some tear-jerker parts. There was also some obvious bad acting and writing as well, but not enough to stop me from watching it. I think what kept me watching was the character of Danny. I really liked him and felt that he was genuine, and I was rooting for him to ""get the girl,"" as well.

Cute movie, good for a rental.",1226361600,9,1454,4.394052044609666
3026381,4,B000YDMPA6,"Danny was born blind and he is now approaching his 21st birthday. He has a warm, supportive, loving Italian family. His brother owns a limousine that doubles as a bordello.

  Danny thinks he is unattractive to women and with the help of his brother sets out to gain experience. This lays the groundwork for a series of comedic interactions with various women, all but one of whom consider Danny an object of pity. The one exception rejects Danny.

  Danny's therapist keeps undressing in front of him, which loses its humor after the first time.

  But, aha, there is an experimental surgical/scientific technique under consideration which could provide Danny with vision.

  Mixed in with this is Danny's flirtation with the surgeon's assistant, an Indian girl. Sparks fly, romance blooms but is doomed for she is to be married to an Indian boy.

  The story becomes a piece of how the cultures keep the lovers apart, the surgery and the inevitable, sugar-coated happy ending.

  This is purely a feel good comedy of manners. It's fun, it's frothy and entertaining. Trying to mix in the heavy themes of Danny's unsighted life and the cultural gap between Indians and Americans works some of the time, but it doesn't add any weight or substance to the movie.

  It's cute and enjoyable and nothing more.

3026382,4,B000YDMPA6,"The title and cover of this DVD suggest a film that is more fluff than substance.  But don't be fooled by these clues.  BLIND DATING is a well-written (Christopher Theo), well-directed (James Keach - brother of Stacy Keach and husband of Jane Seymour) story about the coping of the visually impaired, the quirks of Italian and Indian families, brotherhood, and the gamut of finding the right partner in a world of essential blind dating!  One of the reasons the movie works so well is the ability of actor Chris Pine to make us believe he is blind and convey the positive manner in which people with impairments may 'view' those around them.

Danny (Chris Pine) was born prematurely and as a result is blind, and as he grows toward age 21 he feels he is unattractive to women.  His family is warm, loving and Italian and supportive - especially his brother Larry (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who runs a Limo service and is constantly trying to find Danny his first physical encounter, be that with hookers, girls from the office or neighborhood, or just referrals - each of whom is a disaster when it comes to dealing with a date who is blind!  Danny discovers an operation that implants a camera-like contraption in his brain that will allow him the possibility to see again, even if the images are simply black and white and indistinct.  In the office of ophthalmologist Dr. Perkins (Stephen Tobolowsky) is a young girl Leeza (Anjali Ray) who is Indian and whose parents have arranged a wedding with a man she does not love.  And yes, in time Danny and Leeza are attracted to each other in what appears to be a doomed relationship - for family reasons.  Danny has his operation and is able to see some images, but the implant fails and Danny once again is without sight - but far from being without hope, as both his and Leeza's families undergo changes of heart.

There is a sense of love that emanates from the screen, due in part to the script, the direction, and to the acting.  Chris Pine is exceptionally fine in a challenging role, finding the balance between courage, comedy, and tenderness that makes his character believable and lovable, and never once making a move that breaks his image as a sightless person.  The entire cast is fine, including a hilarious Jane Seymour as Dr. Evans, Chris' therapist with a penchant for disrobing in front of her sightless patient!  But the aspect of the film that sets it apart from many is the presentation of everyday type prejudices that can be every bit as hampering as a physical impairment!  This is a warmhearted, very human comedy with many messages. Grady Harp, April 08",1207008000,36,2620,4.655097613882863
3026383,1,B000YDMPA6,"I did not enjoy this film. I feel like the film poked fun at people who are blind, and made it sound like some un-livable curse. Besides that, the whole  idea of the procedure to make the blind main character see again is not believable; when he first ""sees"", he says he can see white and black, and a square shape. He's been blind his entire life! He wouldn't know what he was seeing at all! Let alone what colors or shapes he's seeing!
I think his desire for a relationship was believable and realistic, but again, I think the women he dated were written into the story to poke fun more than anything, and the result was not in the least bit funny. His relationship with the Indian woman from the clinic was honest and believable, but I think her family problems were distracting from the main character's story, and that angle wasn't very interesting.",1204502400,6,854,4.4743589743589745

It's difficult to come across a film that not only makes you really laugh but also touches your heart on the journey. I could understand how hard it would be telling a story about a blind person and the odd humorous  circumstances they may find themselves in trying to go on blind date (No pun intended) and being politically corrected as to distract one from the story. Well they did it perfectly here with this little gem. If you like Wedding Crashers and Sleepless in Seattle, you will love this story!",1202083200,14,657,4.615384615384615
3026396,3,B000YDMPA6,"Upon watching a movie titled In Front of the Class, this movie showed up as one very similar to that one.

I must say, as a blind person, I'm not so sure how I feel about this movie. Is it romantic and cute? Sure. If you're into that sort of thing. But I couldn't get over some things that I saw in the movie. Now, before anyone gets confused, I am using the word saw as heard, so pardon me if it is not politically correct for some folks. Back to my review.

According to my research, this movie was made in 2008. This movie shows a few people that have some interesting, to say the least, thoughts about how people behave around those of us who are blind. While along time ago, people would be sensitive and think it is sad that one might be blind, such as the first person the main character dated, this isn't so much the case, from what I have seen. Most people are different around blind people, but they aren't to sob or over react like she did.

The other issue with this movie I find is that there was hardly any mention of a cane or braille. As a blind person, I honestly don't think I like this too much. Tradditionally, one who is blind either uses a cane or has a guide dog. For one not to use either of those tools would be foolish. Blind people read as well, and it's important to put braille in a movie talking about blindness. Why? Because if you put no mention of braille or a cane in a movie about a blind person, it makes a blind person look helpless. And truly, we are not.

One more issue I have with this movie is an issue I have with a lot of movies about blind people. In movies, they either make blind people look really smart and brilliant, or really stupid. I mentioned earlier my problem with the director not putting any sort of cane or braille in the movie, and how it might make a blind person look stupid. In my opinion, parts of this movie made the main character look a lot smarter than most blind people. Or maybe it's just me, not really sure. An example of this is when he is dating the girl from the hospital and explains how he can tell she has big eyes and short hair. He says he can tell this by her tone of voice. I'm sorry? If blind people can really do that, then why didn't I get that gift? On the flip side, he does talk about how he can tell what she is thinking by her different voice tones, and I can see how some blind people can do that, so that isn't exactly false.

Other than that, this movie isn't bad. I wouldn't watch it again, because I don't think it's that great either, but it's ok. Nowa days they have audio descriptive movies, ones that are narrated by people, that tell us blind people what is happening. However, when watching it, I did not have that available. I do find that Danny's brother is pretty funny, although like I said earlier, this is definitely a movie I will only watch once.

3026433,5,B000YDMPA6,"BLIND DATING stars actors Chris Pine, who resembles Matt Damon, and Anjali Jay, who resembles herself.  Mr. Pine has acted in the 2009 film Star Trek, and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), as well as 15 other films, such as, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), Just My Luck (2006), Smokin' Aces (2007), Unstoppable (2010), This Means War (2012), and Rise of the Guardians (2012).  Ms. Jay, who lives in England, mainly performs on stage and in television programs.  The film takes place at the present time, most likely in a city known for its medical research, such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles.

THE CLINICAL TRIAL.  The story concerns a blind man in his early 20s, who is distinguished by his charm, intelligence, and unbridled optimism.  Although the first few minutes shows excerpts about Mr. Pine's childhood, where he bumps into trees, the story proper begins when he is considering enrolling as a subject in a clinical trial on a medical device.  The medical device is an artificial eye, which involves the implant of a computer in the brain, and special glasses.  A continuing theme is one of the inclusion for this clinical trial, namely, that the subjects have an optimistic attitude, in face of the possible failure of the clinical trial, and in view of adverse events due to the surgery.  As it turns out, one of the junior clinicians at the eye clinic is Anjali Jay, who happens to be a hottie.

THE LIMO SERVICE.  A common screenwriting technique is to have two or three stories going simultaneously, and in BLIND DATING, it is the case that Chris Pine's brother runs a limousine service, which has the business model of renting the limo plus hooker for an evening of on-the-road romping.  The brother tries to be helpful to Chris Pine, and the viewer is treated to several well-natured attempts at providing Chris Pine with a date.  Some of them are hookers and the others are non-hookers. On one unsuccessful date, the woman (not a hooker) arrives, and upon learning that Mr. Pine is blind, begins weeping.  She has a funny, whimpy voice.  At the restaurant, she continues to weep.  On another unsuccessful date, the woman (also not a hooker) devises a way to cope with the fact that she is blind, and she decides to tie her scarf around her eyes during the entire date.  But this spoils the mood that Chris Pine was hoping for, and the date is not a success.  And then, the viewer is treated to a couple of other dates of Mr. Pine and a hooker, and the storyline shows that the man is simply is devoid of concupiscence, and in contrast, is seeking a ""relationship.""

INTELLIGENCE MAKES ITS ENTRANCE.  Meanwhile, Chris Pine is developing a genuine love-relationship with Anjali Jay (and who wouldn't), and Anjali Jay is developing a love interest in Chris Pine.  Both characters are very intelligent, as Mr. Pine is enrolled in law school, and Ms. Jay is hoping to enroll in medical school.

THE INDIAN FACTOR.  At the halfway point in the story, another element of complexity occurs, namely the fact that Ms. Jay is engaged to be married in a traditional wedding to an Indian man.  The Indian man proclaims that Anjali Jay's job is to assist him in the restaurant business and to make babies.  (This does not exactly thrill the medical school hopeful).  During the film, the Indian man is shown to be socially inept.  For example, he crosses the street with Anjali Jay, and once on the other side, grabs her bodaceous ta-ta's and bears a lustful smile, and at the same time, his mother and grandmother (in a walker) are crossing the street and are almost run over by a taxi cab, and the taxi comes to a grinding stop.  Somewhat later, at the wedding party, the Indian man places the wedding ring on Anjali Jay's finger, and proclaims, ""I hope it fits.""  The sentence, ""I hope it fits"" contains only four words.  But this sentence sums up the entire movie.  The sentence, ""I hope it fits"" communicates the fact that the Indian man DOES NOT FIT into Anjali Jay's personal agenda, that she does not love him, and that the Indian man is incapable of respecting her aspirations for her own life, e.g., medical school.

CONCLUSION.  Regarding standard movie themes, the movie's main character (Chris Pine) has a disability, as is the case in many other movies, such as, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, RAINMAN, and MY LEFT FOOT.  The film also has the standard theme where two lovers of two different cultural backgrounds are faced with antagonism from older members of their family, as can be found in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.  However, BLIND DATING is anything but a standard movie.  The scriptwriting, by Christopher Theo, is one of continuous subtlety, intelligence, and comedy.  In contrast to most other comedies, which contain cute grimaces, trite expressions, dismissive remarks, and the like, which have been recycled over and over and over in many romance comedies, there is nothing trite or recycles in BLIND DATING.  (I do not give away the ending.)  FIVE STARS to BLIND DATING",1382659200,,5018,4.7307249712313

3026436,4,B000YDMPA6,"***Note: I always round up with ""half-stars.""

""Blind Dating"" is a move that has some charm, wit, humor, and some touching moments.  Part of the problem is that the movie isn't quite sure what it is trying to be.  However, Chris Pine and Anjali Jay are what make this film watchable and, for the most part, enjoyable.

Danny (Chris Pine) is a young man who has been blind his whole life.  He grew up subject to pranks by his older brother, Lorenzo (wonderfully played by ""American Pie"" actor Eddie Kaye Thomas).  Danny, despite his handicap makes the most of his life, and he certainly isn't looking for pity or sympathy from anyone.  He rarely uses a cane, and when someone asks his psychologist, Dr. Evans why he doesn't.  She replies, ""Because he doesn't think of himself as blind.""  Danny isn't a character we feel sorry for.  He's a character that we root and cheer for.  And very often, those are the best kind!

Danny is interested in meeting a woman and having a relationship, as long as the person isn't obsessed or has a problem with his blindness.  There is a fairly hilarious sequence where Lorzeno, who has a job as a limo driver, hooks Danny up with some...interesting, bizarre, and funny women who are clearly all wrong for Danny.

Later, Danny meets Leeza, the new receptionist at the doctor's office.  He qualifies for a surgical procedure that might grant him sight.  At first, he doesn't particularly like Leeza, who he finds to be rude, and she isn't exactly enchanted by him either.  However, as they begin spending time getting to know one another, they find that they enjoy being with each other.  There is, however, one glitch:  Leeza is Indian and all-but-promised to another Indian man, arranged by her parents.

The chemistry between Chris Pine and Anjali Jay is first-rate.  The best actors act with their eyes.  Anjali is exceptionally good at this, and Pine is just as effective with subtle facial expressions that tell us all that we need to know about how these two feel about each other.  Part of the problem, is that the movie doesn't focus enough on them.  Too much time is spent and other frivolous scenes that just don't add anything to the film.  There are many short scenes that take the pacing away from the film as well.  Another editor may have done the film more justice.  Too many times I was wanting more of a scene that was barely a couple of minutes long.  And other times I was wondering why a certain scene was in the movie at all.  The movie needed better editing, and I think they should have stretched it out by another fifteen to twenty minutes.

Part of the film is spent on Danny and his surgical procedure.  This was fine.  Pine does a great and credible job as a man who can't see, as well as a man who is struggling to deal with the results of the procedure.

Performances all-around are very good.  Pine and Jay are superb, and there are some great supporting performances contributed by Jane Seymour and Stephen Tobolowsky.  And, of course, Eddie Kaye Thomas has a natural gift for comedy, as most of us already know.

I really liked the different twist on interracial dating, especially since the 'blind' character
was truly 'color blind' in addition to being legally blind.

I actually watched this film about 4 times.  It was that good.
There were so many cool touches.  And the screenplay was terrific!!!
Well worth paying for.

I thought it was endearing how Pine's character's family rallies around him as he tries to cope and mature with his blindness. Danny's (Pine) brother Larry is hilarious! He sets him up on some blind dates that are unbelievable and just cracked me up! And it was a new appreciation for cultural differences as Danny falls in love with an Indian girl.

I know friend who is a little like Danny's character. I've never seen her use a cane, and although she's got a guide dog, the dog is more of a pet. Sometimes, it's hard to think that she's blind. Pine makes it seem as if he really is blind.

Pine did a wonderful job as Danny, and his good looks and impossibly blue eyes make me like him even more.

I'm a sucker for romance and a pretty face, and although this movie is not the best, the acting itself makes Blind Dating worth a watch.",1328227200,,694,4.203007518796992

I loved the plot, the comedy hit just right, even the little ""odd"" or ""quirky"" parts fit in perfect. My son even commented afterwards that he wished there were more movies out like this one. It's nice to sit down and watch a fun loving and hassle free movie every once in awhile, and this is that movie!",1318032000,,584,4.223214285714286
3026463,5,B000YDMPA6,"This movie is from before Chris Pine burned out and became just another pretty face in the crowd of vain and self-absorbed Hollywood hunks spending hours at the gym trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should. In this movie, because he wasn't famous yet, he actually had to do some acting instead of relying on a shirt-less scene.

Pine and Anjali Jay have great chemistry and I loved how they inserted the inter-cultural tension there; an element which made this movie be more than just another ""boy meets girl"" story-line. Somehow the fact that someone so un-apple-pie and un-American as Anjali Jay has become Danny's love-interest was very intriguing.

This is a movie that works. Somehow, and I don't know why, the film got around my guard, overcame my cynicism, and left me sitting there with a grin on my face. And that's ultimately what makes a great movie right?

So, if you're a hard-bitten intellectual and you're into serious films and don't like to get taken for a sucker by watching such a movie, this isn't your film. Even I feel like that myself most of the time. But if occasionally you come down with an attack of warm-heartedness, then this movie is likely to blindside you.",1290988800,,1220,4.691588785046729
3026464,4,B000YDMPA6,"When Netflix recommended Blind Dating, I watched the trailer and was mildly unimpressed. Blind, cute 22-year-old virgin Danny (the future James T. Kirk in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition)</a>, Chris Pine) goes on a succession of awful dates in an attempt to set him up. It looked like a mashup of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>. But after watching the whole film, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a sunny little film about following your own path (and your heart).

At its core, the film is the story of a loving Italian-American family (the rowdy clan reminded me strongly of the Vecchio family in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-South-The-Ultimate-Collection-Three-Complete-Seasons/dp/B0017KP8Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due South: The Ultimate Collection - Three Complete Seasons</a>) whose youngest son was a three-month preemie who was born blind. This never stopped Danny from experiencing the world on his terms; he loves to pull daredevil stunts and is good at sports. He also doesn't use a cane or guide dog to get around. Chris Pine does a good job of navigating as a blind man; you can sense by the way he interacts with his surroundings whether a place is new for him or not, and thankfully he doesn't stop and feel everyone's face on the first meeting.

When an eye doctor offers Danny the chance to participate in an experimental surgery that may give him some vision, his close-knit family is thrown into turmoil. The risky surgery involves implanting a device into Danny's brain that will receive signals from a specially-wired pair of glasses (think early Virtual Reality goggles). If it works, he might be able to see grainy pictures in black and white. In all fairness, I felt that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-First-Sight/dp/B00000IBL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At First Sight</a>&nbsp;with Val Kilmer handled this a bit better; Kilmer gave a real sense of disorientation at seeing for the first time, whereas Pine doesn't get much screen time devoted to the actual surgery and its impact.

At the doctor's office, Danny meets Leeza (Anjali Jay), a young Indian woman who dreams of going to medical school. Leeza's family owns an Indian restaurant, and she's engaged to the gorgeous (but shallow) Arvind and his greedy parents. Leeza and Danny's first meeting is rather hostile, but the two are gradually drawn to one another even as Danny's brother Larry sets him up on that series of fateful dates. There is some sex humor to be sure (involving hookers and a surprising primer on condoms), but it only plays a small role in the overall scheme of the film. Jane Seymour puts in a sexy (and rather unexpected) turn as a kinky psychiatrist (I can only hope that I look that good at her age!).

This is a cute little love story with a few culture clashes along the way, but overall I really enjoyed Blind Dating. Extras include numerous deleted scenes, a brief ""making of"" trailer, and an English for the Visually Impaired audio track, with an offscreen narrator describing the onscreen action in the third person (however, the movie's audio track is muted, making it hard to hear the actual dialogue when presented in this format).

If you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-First-Sight/dp/B00000IBL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At First Sight</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)</a>, you'll probably enjoy Blind Dating.

Danny was blind from birth, and he has a lot going for him. Great personality, great looks, but he doesn't have a woman to share it with. With the help of his brother Larry, he goes on a few (slightly overacted) dates. But, he really likes the receptionist at his doctor's office, Leeza. Danny is being tested to participate in an experimental brain operation so he can see again. But, not that many have been performed. Even though he's comfortable in his own skin, he is tired of women feeling sorry for him because he is blind. So, he is thinking of getting that operation.

Meanwhile, Leeza has a secret. Though Danny doesn't know she is Indian, and doesn't really care, she has an arranged marriage coming up, but she's confused about her feelings for her future husband. Can she break that promise to her family to be with Danny? Will she tell him that she is going to marry someone else?

It was a touching movie with some tear-jerker parts. There was also some obvious bad acting and writing as well, but not enough to stop me from watching it. I think what kept me watching was the character of Danny. I really liked him and felt that he was genuine, and I was rooting for him to ""get the girl,"" as well.

  Danny thinks he is unattractive to women and with the help of his brother sets out to gain experience. This lays the groundwork for a series of comedic interactions with various women, all but one of whom consider Danny an object of pity. The one exception rejects Danny.

  Danny's therapist keeps undressing in front of him, which loses its humor after the first time.

  But, aha, there is an experimental surgical/scientific technique under consideration which could provide Danny with vision.

  Mixed in with this is Danny's flirtation with the surgeon's assistant, an Indian girl. Sparks fly, romance blooms but is doomed for she is to be married to an Indian boy.

  The story becomes a piece of how the cultures keep the lovers apart, the surgery and the inevitable, sugar-coated happy ending.

  This is purely a feel good comedy of manners. It's fun, it's frothy and entertaining. Trying to mix in the heavy themes of Danny's unsighted life and the cultural gap between Indians and Americans works some of the time, but it doesn't add any weight or substance to the movie.

  It's cute and enjoyable and nothing more.

3260879,4,B000YDMPA6,"The title and cover of this DVD suggest a film that is more fluff than substance.  But don't be fooled by these clues.  BLIND DATING is a well-written (Christopher Theo), well-directed (James Keach - brother of Stacy Keach and husband of Jane Seymour) story about the coping of the visually impaired, the quirks of Italian and Indian families, brotherhood, and the gamut of finding the right partner in a world of essential blind dating!  One of the reasons the movie works so well is the ability of actor Chris Pine to make us believe he is blind and convey the positive manner in which people with impairments may 'view' those around them.

Danny (Chris Pine) was born prematurely and as a result is blind, and as he grows toward age 21 he feels he is unattractive to women.  His family is warm, loving and Italian and supportive - especially his brother Larry (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who runs a Limo service and is constantly trying to find Danny his first physical encounter, be that with hookers, girls from the office or neighborhood, or just referrals - each of whom is a disaster when it comes to dealing with a date who is blind!  Danny discovers an operation that implants a camera-like contraption in his brain that will allow him the possibility to see again, even if the images are simply black and white and indistinct.  In the office of ophthalmologist Dr. Perkins (Stephen Tobolowsky) is a young girl Leeza (Anjali Ray) who is Indian and whose parents have arranged a wedding with a man she does not love.  And yes, in time Danny and Leeza are attracted to each other in what appears to be a doomed relationship - for family reasons.  Danny has his operation and is able to see some images, but the implant fails and Danny once again is without sight - but far from being without hope, as both his and Leeza's families undergo changes of heart.

There is a sense of love that emanates from the screen, due in part to the script, the direction, and to the acting.  Chris Pine is exceptionally fine in a challenging role, finding the balance between courage, comedy, and tenderness that makes his character believable and lovable, and never once making a move that breaks his image as a sightless person.  The entire cast is fine, including a hilarious Jane Seymour as Dr. Evans, Chris' therapist with a penchant for disrobing in front of her sightless patient!  But the aspect of the film that sets it apart from many is the presentation of everyday type prejudices that can be every bit as hampering as a physical impairment!  This is a warmhearted, very human comedy with many messages. Grady Harp, April 08",1207008000,36,2620,4.655097613882863
3260880,1,B000YDMPA6,"I did not enjoy this film. I feel like the film poked fun at people who are blind, and made it sound like some un-livable curse. Besides that, the whole  idea of the procedure to make the blind main character see again is not believable; when he first ""sees"", he says he can see white and black, and a square shape. He's been blind his entire life! He wouldn't know what he was seeing at all! Let alone what colors or shapes he's seeing!
I think his desire for a relationship was believable and realistic, but again, I think the women he dated were written into the story to poke fun more than anything, and the result was not in the least bit funny. His relationship with the Indian woman from the clinic was honest and believable, but I think her family problems were distracting from the main character's story, and that angle wasn't very interesting.",1204502400,6,854,4.4743589743589745

It's difficult to come across a film that not only makes you really laugh but also touches your heart on the journey. I could understand how hard it would be telling a story about a blind person and the odd humorous  circumstances they may find themselves in trying to go on blind date (No pun intended) and being politically corrected as to distract one from the story.

3260893,3,B000YDMPA6,"Upon watching a movie titled In Front of the Class, this movie showed up as one very similar to that one.

I must say, as a blind person, I'm not so sure how I feel about this movie. Is it romantic and cute? Sure. If you're into that sort of thing. But I couldn't get over some things that I saw in the movie. Now, before anyone gets confused, I am using the word saw as heard, so pardon me if it is not politically correct for some folks. Back to my review.

According to my research, this movie was made in 2008. This movie shows a few people that have some interesting, to say the least, thoughts about how people behave around those of us who are blind. While along time ago, people would be sensitive and think it is sad that one might be blind, such as the first person the main character dated, this isn't so much the case, from what I have seen. Most people are different around blind people, but they aren't to sob or over react like she did.

The other issue with this movie I find is that there was hardly any mention of a cane or braille. As a blind person, I honestly don't think I like this too much. Tradditionally, one who is blind either uses a cane or has a guide dog. For one not to use either of those tools would be foolish. Blind people read as well, and it's important to put braille in a movie talking about blindness. Why? Because if you put no mention of braille or a cane in a movie about a blind person, it makes a blind person look helpless. And truly, we are not.

One more issue I have with this movie is an issue I have with a lot of movies about blind people. In movies, they either make blind people look really smart and brilliant, or really stupid. I mentioned earlier my problem with the director not putting any sort of cane or braille in the movie, and how it might make a blind person look stupid. In my opinion, parts of this movie made the main character look a lot smarter than most blind people. Or maybe it's just me, not really sure. An example of this is when he is dating the girl from the hospital and explains how he can tell she has big eyes and short hair. He says he can tell this by her tone of voice. I'm sorry? If blind people can really do that, then why didn't I get that gift? On the flip side, he does talk about how he can tell what she is thinking by her different voice tones, and I can see how some blind people can do that, so that isn't exactly false.

Other than that, this movie isn't bad. I wouldn't watch it again, because I don't think it's that great either, but it's ok. Nowa days they have audio descriptive movies, ones that are narrated by people, that tell us blind people what is happening. However, when watching it, I did not have that available. I do find that Danny's brother is pretty funny, although like I said earlier, this is definitely a movie I will only watch once.

Instead, it's anything but that.  Chris delivers a wonderful performance, and of course, he gets the girl in the end.

3260930,5,B000YDMPA6,"BLIND DATING stars actors Chris Pine, who resembles Matt Damon, and Anjali Jay, who resembles herself.  Mr. Pine has acted in the 2009 film Star Trek, and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), as well as 15 other films, such as, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), Just My Luck (2006), Smokin' Aces (2007), Unstoppable (2010), This Means War (2012), and Rise of the Guardians (2012).  Ms. Jay, who lives in England, mainly performs on stage and in television programs.  The film takes place at the present time, most likely in a city known for its medical research, such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles.

THE CLINICAL TRIAL.  The story concerns a blind man in his early 20s, who is distinguished by his charm, intelligence, and unbridled optimism.  Although the first few minutes shows excerpts about Mr. Pine's childhood, where he bumps into trees, the story proper begins when he is considering enrolling as a subject in a clinical trial on a medical device.  The medical device is an artificial eye, which involves the implant of a computer in the brain, and special glasses.  A continuing theme is one of the inclusion for this clinical trial, namely, that the subjects have an optimistic attitude, in face of the possible failure of the clinical trial, and in view of adverse events due to the surgery.  As it turns out, one of the junior clinicians at the eye clinic is Anjali Jay, who happens to be a hottie.

THE LIMO SERVICE.  A common screenwriting technique is to have two or three stories going simultaneously, and in BLIND DATING, it is the case that Chris Pine's brother runs a limousine service, which has the business model of renting the limo plus hooker for an evening of on-the-road romping.  The brother tries to be helpful to Chris Pine, and the viewer is treated to several well-natured attempts at providing Chris Pine with a date.  Some of them are hookers and the others are non-hookers. On one unsuccessful date, the woman (not a hooker) arrives, and upon learning that Mr. Pine is blind, begins weeping.  She has a funny, whimpy voice.  At the restaurant, she continues to weep.  On another unsuccessful date, the woman (also not a hooker) devises a way to cope with the fact that she is blind, and she decides to tie her scarf around her eyes during the entire date.  But this spoils the mood that Chris Pine was hoping for, and the date is not a success.  And then, the viewer is treated to a couple of other dates of Mr. Pine and a hooker, and the storyline shows that the man is simply is devoid of concupiscence, and in contrast, is seeking a ""relationship.""

INTELLIGENCE MAKES ITS ENTRANCE.  Meanwhile, Chris Pine is developing a genuine love-relationship with Anjali Jay (and who wouldn't), and Anjali Jay is developing a love interest in Chris Pine.  Both characters are very intelligent, as Mr. Pine is enrolled in law school, and Ms. Jay is hoping to enroll in medical school.

THE INDIAN FACTOR.  At the halfway point in the story, another element of complexity occurs, namely the fact that Ms. Jay is engaged to be married in a traditional wedding to an Indian man.  The Indian man proclaims that Anjali Jay's job is to assist him in the restaurant business and to make babies.  (This does not exactly thrill the medical school hopeful).  During the film, the Indian man is shown to be socially inept.  For example, he crosses the street with Anjali Jay, and once on the other side, grabs her bodaceous ta-ta's and bears a lustful smile, and at the same time, his mother and grandmother (in a walker) are crossing the street and are almost run over by a taxi cab, and the taxi comes to a grinding stop.  Somewhat later, at the wedding party, the Indian man places the wedding ring on Anjali Jay's finger, and proclaims, ""I hope it fits.""  The sentence, ""I hope it fits"" contains only four words.  But this sentence sums up the entire movie.  The sentence, ""I hope it fits"" communicates the fact that the Indian man DOES NOT FIT into Anjali Jay's personal agenda, that she does not love him, and that the Indian man is incapable of respecting her aspirations for her own life, e.g., medical school.

CONCLUSION.  Regarding standard movie themes, the movie's main character (Chris Pine) has a disability, as is the case in many other movies, such as, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, RAINMAN, and MY LEFT FOOT.  The film also has the standard theme where two lovers of two different cultural backgrounds are faced with antagonism from older members of their family, as can be found in FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.  However, BLIND DATING is anything but a standard movie.  The scriptwriting, by Christopher Theo, is one of continuous subtlety, intelligence, and comedy.  In contrast to most other comedies, which contain cute grimaces, trite expressions, dismissive remarks, and the like, which have been recycled over and over and over in many romance comedies, there is nothing trite or recycles in BLIND DATING.  (I do not give away the ending.)  FIVE STARS to BLIND DATING",1382659200,,5018,4.7307249712313
3260931,4,B000YDMPA6,Great cast of characters. Liked the insight into living with blindness and Indianism. A little love triangle for tension and some great lines.,1379548800,,142,5.217391304347826

3260933,4,B000YDMPA6,"***Note: I always round up with ""half-stars.""

""Blind Dating"" is a move that has some charm, wit, humor, and some touching moments.  Part of the problem is that the movie isn't quite sure what it is trying to be.  However, Chris Pine and Anjali Jay are what make this film watchable and, for the most part, enjoyable.

Danny (Chris Pine) is a young man who has been blind his whole life.  He grew up subject to pranks by his older brother, Lorenzo (wonderfully played by ""American Pie"" actor Eddie Kaye Thomas).  Danny, despite his handicap makes the most of his life, and he certainly isn't looking for pity or sympathy from anyone.  He rarely uses a cane, and when someone asks his psychologist, Dr. Evans why he doesn't.  She replies, ""Because he doesn't think of himself as blind.""  Danny isn't a character we feel sorry for.  He's a character that we root and cheer for.  And very often, those are the best kind!

Danny is interested in meeting a woman and having a relationship, as long as the person isn't obsessed or has a problem with his blindness.  There is a fairly hilarious sequence where Lorzeno, who has a job as a limo driver, hooks Danny up with some...interesting, bizarre, and funny women who are clearly all wrong for Danny.

Later, Danny meets Leeza, the new receptionist at the doctor's office.  He qualifies for a surgical procedure that might grant him sight.  At first, he doesn't particularly like Leeza, who he finds to be rude, and she isn't exactly enchanted by him either.  However, as they begin spending time getting to know one another, they find that they enjoy being with each other.  There is, however, one glitch:  Leeza is Indian and all-but-promised to another Indian man, arranged by her parents.

The chemistry between Chris Pine and Anjali Jay is first-rate.  The best actors act with their eyes.  Anjali is exceptionally good at this, and Pine is just as effective with subtle facial expressions that tell us all that we need to know about how these two feel about each other.  Part of the problem, is that the movie doesn't focus enough on them.  Too much time is spent and other frivolous scenes that just don't add anything to the film.  There are many short scenes that take the pacing away from the film as well.  Another editor may have done the film more justice.  Too many times I was wanting more of a scene that was barely a couple of minutes long.  And other times I was wondering why a certain scene was in the movie at all.  The movie needed better editing, and I think they should have stretched it out by another fifteen to twenty minutes.

Part of the film is spent on Danny and his surgical procedure.  This was fine.  Pine does a great and credible job as a man who can't see, as well as a man who is struggling to deal with the results of the procedure.

Performances all-around are very good.  Pine and Jay are superb, and there are some great supporting performances contributed by Jane Seymour and Stephen Tobolowsky.  And, of course, Eddie Kaye Thomas has a natural gift for comedy, as most of us already know.

In short, I enjoyed this movie.  I just couldn't help but feel that it could have been so much better than what it turned out to be.  I wanted more of Danny and Leeza because they are the heart and the meat of the story.",1377648000,,3299,4.5288135593220336

I had an Uncle that faced a serious physical problem but his heart was always so forgiving and found joy in the important things of life.  He held a job when others couldn't get one.

I thought it was endearing how Pine's character's family rallies around him as he tries to cope and mature with his blindness. Danny's (Pine) brother Larry is hilarious! He sets him up on some blind dates that are unbelievable and just cracked me up! And it was a new appreciation for cultural differences as Danny falls in love with an Indian girl. Like I said, comical and at times laugh-out-loud funny. Pine is a far cry from James T. Kirk or FDR Foster in this one, but certainly entertaining.",1330300800,,675,4.495934959349594

I know friend who is a little like Danny's character. I've never seen her use a cane, and although she's got a guide dog, the dog is more of a pet. Sometimes, it's hard to think that she's blind. Pine makes it seem as if he really is blind.

Pine did a wonderful job as Danny, and his good looks and impossibly blue eyes make me like him even more.

I'm a sucker for romance and a pretty face, and although this movie is not the best, the acting itself makes Blind Dating worth a watch.",1328227200,,694,4.203007518796992

I loved the plot, the comedy hit just right, even the little ""odd"" or ""quirky"" parts fit in perfect. My son even commented afterwards that he wished there were more movies out like this one. It's nice to sit down and watch a fun loving and hassle free movie every once in awhile, and this is that movie!",1318032000,,584,4.223214285714286
3260960,5,B000YDMPA6,"This movie is from before Chris Pine burned out and became just another pretty face in the crowd of vain and self-absorbed Hollywood hunks spending hours at the gym trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should. In this movie, because he wasn't famous yet, he actually had to do some acting instead of relying on a shirt-less scene.

Pine and Anjali Jay have great chemistry and I loved how they inserted the inter-cultural tension there; an element which made this movie be more than just another ""boy meets girl"" story-line. Somehow the fact that someone so un-apple-pie and un-American as Anjali Jay has become Danny's love-interest was very intriguing.

This is a movie that works. Somehow, and I don't know why, the film got around my guard, overcame my cynicism, and left me sitting there with a grin on my face. And that's ultimately what makes a great movie right?

So, if you're a hard-bitten intellectual and you're into serious films and don't like to get taken for a sucker by watching such a movie, this isn't your film. Even I feel like that myself most of the time. But if occasionally you come down with an attack of warm-heartedness, then this movie is likely to blindside you.",1290988800,,1220,4.691588785046729

Kirk in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition)</a>, Chris Pine) goes on a succession of awful dates in an attempt to set him up. It looked like a mashup of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>. But after watching the whole film, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a sunny little film about following your own path (and your heart).

At its core, the film is the story of a loving Italian-American family (the rowdy clan reminded me strongly of the Vecchio family in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-South-The-Ultimate-Collection-Three-Complete-Seasons/dp/B0017KP8Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due South: The Ultimate Collection - Three Complete Seasons</a>) whose youngest son was a three-month preemie who was born blind. This never stopped Danny from experiencing the world on his terms; he loves to pull daredevil stunts and is good at sports. He also doesn't use a cane or guide dog to get around. Chris Pine does a good job of navigating as a blind man; you can sense by the way he interacts with his surroundings whether a place is new for him or not, and thankfully he doesn't stop and feel everyone's face on the first meeting.

When an eye doctor offers Danny the chance to participate in an experimental surgery that may give him some vision, his close-knit family is thrown into turmoil. The risky surgery involves implanting a device into Danny's brain that will receive signals from a specially-wired pair of glasses (think early Virtual Reality goggles). If it works, he might be able to see grainy pictures in black and white. In all fairness, I felt that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-First-Sight/dp/B00000IBL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At First Sight</a>&nbsp;with Val Kilmer handled this a bit better; Kilmer gave a real sense of disorientation at seeing for the first time, whereas Pine doesn't get much screen time devoted to the actual surgery and its impact.

At the doctor's office, Danny meets Leeza (Anjali Jay), a young Indian woman who dreams of going to medical school. Leeza's family owns an Indian restaurant, and she's engaged to the gorgeous (but shallow) Arvind and his greedy parents. Leeza and Danny's first meeting is rather hostile, but the two are gradually drawn to one another even as Danny's brother Larry sets him up on that series of fateful dates. There is some sex humor to be sure (involving hookers and a surprising primer on condoms), but it only plays a small role in the overall scheme of the film. Jane Seymour puts in a sexy (and rather unexpected) turn as a kinky psychiatrist (I can only hope that I look that good at her age!).

This is a cute little love story with a few culture clashes along the way, but overall I really enjoyed Blind Dating. Extras include numerous deleted scenes, a brief ""making of"" trailer, and an English for the Visually Impaired audio track, with an offscreen narrator describing the onscreen action in the third person (however, the movie's audio track is muted, making it hard to hear the actual dialogue when presented in this format).

If you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-First-Sight/dp/B00000IBL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At First Sight</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)</a>, you'll probably enjoy Blind Dating.
