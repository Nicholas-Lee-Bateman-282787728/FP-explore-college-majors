8280818,3,B000GRTR3S,"There's nothing really wrong with this set of ""Lone Ranger"" and ""Buffalo Bill, Jr."" episodes, but most are available on other inexpensive compilations, particularly the Lone Ranger shows.  The four ""Ranger"" eps are nice prints, better than most I've seen of these early episodes. The seven ""Bill"" shows are a little dark, but certainly viewable. The sound is fine, with very little hiss or pop.

""The Lone Ranger"" episodes included in this set are from early in the first season: 'High Heels', 'Enter the Lone Ranger', 'The Lone Ranger Fights On' and 'Rustler's Hideout'.  Curiously this set includes the first two of the three ""Ranger"" shows that established the characters back-story (`Enter' and `Fights On'), but did not include the last show in this three-part story arc.

""Buffalo Bill Jr."" episodes included in this set are 'Runaway Renegade', 'The Death of Johnny Ringo' (featuring a very young Angie Dickinson), 'Boomer's Blunder', 'Empire Pass', 'The Black Ghost', 'Trail of the Killer' and 'Rails Westward'.

As a bonus feature, the DVD includes an episode from ""The Lone Ranger"" radio series, 'Refund for Thunder'.

As with all St. Clair Entertainment DVDs, be sure to immediately page through the chapters of the disc when you receive it - their products are prone to include manufacturing flaws.",1179792000,2,1309,5.150943396226415
