5927081,5,B00EL6ABAI,"Truly a great band that seemed desined for greatness just like Badfinger. Though Badfinger story is the most tragic i believe in rock history. And second be Bobby Fuller who story is well worth finding out about. I do believe sincerely though if giiven the chance musician like this would have soon been in the big time and hot rock category,..even now just like the rolling stones, fleetwood mac etc. My first recollection about Big Star was their 1st record & instantly took a liking to it... at the same time i began to be impressed by much of the work of another el surpremo sometimes these days Todd Rundgren, also under -a appreciated. Big Star also before Alex had an earlier phase... known as Rock City & released one album with Jody Stephens & Chris Bell. Equally impressed and some excellent amazing music on that record. The singer, who's name i cant remember... really helped create such a dynmamic sound who left . Just when Alex Chiltern had left the amazing, fantastic Box tops. He knew i guess Chris Bell from school & they called themselves Big Star. However the previous band ""Rock city"" too left a formidable body of work.
.Interesting to note how great it be to have Alex career highlighted individually.
The Box tops , the band he was previous apart of were famous internationally.
So this next group  thing was kinda weird, that they were forgotton, left behind & abandoned. The ought to have been given a clear path to show their wares .
 The previous group with many hit songs.. as far as main media was concerned i guess was enough though.
That view is such a pity though. Taking a dim view sucks. Potential hitmakers...offering  us their ""cheeries""
 Cos like this, Badfinger, they were amazing.
Badfinger were in deep though with evil management ignoring pleas to receive their dues.
As was heard in Pete Ham solo records...the hits were there in waiting. Pity lives like his, Chris Bell...Tom Evans... there lives were lost due to the uncertainty of the music world back then. Sure they have greater appreciation now. But why could they have been treated better. Easy to find their music, even greater it would have been if they weere still alive. Alex surprise passing recent times too was such a huge loss to he music industry.
Looking back the same can be mentioned of Big Star, the hits were right there waiting, ready to be heard. Thankfully now, we can actually here them...oh yeah & Rock city too(good band also )Alex was a great performer as was Chris, Jody and the guy Andy who sung India.
The documentary here is informative,
is most pleasing for us the fans
& the potential new ones & fellow musicians.",1386460800,3,2640,4.670967741935484
5927082,5,B00EL6ABAI,"BIG STAR is a band that the critics instantly liked but sometimes all the things music critics like (subtlety, nuance, odd blend of old and new, independence, tendency to go against taste and music biz trends) can also makes them seem obscure to the typical record buyer. And to this day BIG STAR is known and appreciated mainly by music critics, independent singer-songwriters, and avid record collectors. I doubt this documentary will change that. What this documentary will do is make the BIG STAR story a little clearer to those who already own a BIG STAR album or two (or all three) and who already know bits and pieces of their story.

The BIG STAR story is an odd one because unlike most rock stories there was no rise and fall, there was just a first record that received a lot of great reviews (in Creem, in Rolling Stone, in Melody Maker....) but never sold, and then another record (featuring a cover photo by none other than William Eggleston) that received even more great reviews and never sold, and then a (willfully obscure) third that never sold. Thats the story of BIG STAR in a nutshell. But what makes this story interesting is that its really not ultimately a rock story (immense wealth, world tours, groupies, drug abuse) but a story of how these four individuals individually dealt with their complete lack of success (Chilton's stint as lead singer of The Box Tops excepted). If that sounds like a sad story, well, you're right, this is a sad story. But its a sad story with a lot of heart, a story about the thrill of early promise and the slow fade of premature burnout before life's even had a chance to properly begin---the same story the music tells----and fans of BIG STAR will respond to this doc in the same way they respond to the music because it feels good to adore music and musicians you can actually relate to and most musicians and rock critics and record collectors who like this band fancy themselves independents/ industry and social outcasts. Its hard to relate to Bowie or the Stones or Led Zep, but its easy to relate to BIG STAR. Their story is in a way every kid who has dreamed of rock stardom's story. And since most of us never became rock stars this story feels like our story.

But of course none of this matters if the music isn't good. And the music is good. BIG STAR has a handful of songs that would fit into the power pop category (""Feel"", ""In the Street"" and ""Don't Lie To Me"") but most of their stuff is wistful even melancholy (and many of the critics mention this unusual combination of ""vibrancy"" and soul-searching angst). To my ears their most memorable stuff (""The Ballad of El Goodo"" and ""September Gurls"") sounds like what the Byrds (perhaps the most thoughtful of the 60's bands) might have sounded like had they been an early 70's instead of a mid-60's band. In other words BIG STAR (at their most lyrical) sounds like a retro act so I suppose its no surprise that their greatest moment of fame was at the 1973 Rock Writers Convention in Memphis (the first and last of its kind) where they played their British Invasion and Byrds-influenced retro-nostalgic-for-simpler-and-truer-times-sound to a group of rock critics (Lester Bangs, Cameron Crowe, Richard Meltzer) who were all extremely tired of the whole early 70's scene and were always battling a premature burnout of their own. The critics had all given them rave reviews and now here they were hearing them live--this band no one but they knew about. They probably liked that feeling. Just like we like the feeling of listening to something only we and a handful of friends know about.

Great rock doc about a little-known band that will probably remain that way.

BIG STAR must-listens:

Number One Record: ""Ballad of El Goodo,"" ""In the Street,"" ""Thirteen,"" and ""Watch the Sunrise.""

Radio City: ""O My Soul,"" ""Back of a Car,"" ""Daisy Glaze,"" and ""September Gurls.""

Third/Sister Lovers (basically an Alex Chilton solo album and a pretty drugged out one albeit with these moments of beauty): ""Big Black Car (Nothing Can Hurt Me),"" ""Holocaust,"" ""Kangaroo,"" and ""Nightime.""

*Chris Bell's ""I am the Cosmos"" and ""You and Your Sister"" also well worth listening to. And if you like Chris Bell's solo stuff you might also like Skip Spence's OAR (1969).",1386028800,17,4270,4.714477211796247
5927083,5,B00EL6ABAI,"Up until about three years ago, I knew very little about Big Star. A friend of mine gave me a CD of their music - #1 Record and Radio City - to have a listen to (after I mentioned about how much I loved Badfinger) and I really enjoyed it. Back this past summer though, everything changed when my friend came back into town and we went to watch the documentary 'Big Star : Nothing Can Hurt Me' in the theatre. After witnessing the story of everything they went through and hearing their music alongside all the images and brilliantly compiled footage and interviews, I had a deeper sense of appreciation for Alex Chilton, Jody Stephens, Chris Bell and Andy Hummel and all that they had set out to do with this amazing group. Within days I was re-listening to that initial CD that I was given plus I also went out and bought the soundtrack plus their last release 'Third / Sister Lovers'. Writer / Director Drew DeNicola and Co-Director Olivia Mori wonderfully put together what I would deem by far one of the best band documentaries that I have ever seen and one that will definitely stand the test of time as the DEFINITIVE story of the one of the world's greatest undiscovered treasures - Big Star. Although sadly three of the four members are no longer with us, it's never too late to discover the artistic brilliance of what they are - or what they were wanting to accomplish - and watching this documentary will make you more then just a fan of their music.",1383782400,34,1461,4.455223880597015
5927084,4,B00EL6ABAI,"The sad story of the ultimate cult band captured at last in a loving but candid documentary by Drew DeNicola. Jody Stephens and the late Andy Hummel are solid as a rock in interviews, just as they were as Big Star's rhythm section, while Chris Bell and Alex Chilton are portrayed as mercurial, brilliant and unpredictable. The growth of Big Star as one of first true cult bands is an interesting story in itself, a fire that was stoked by fanboy/girl rock journos. The demise of directionless Bell and self-destruction of Chilton's career also captured in some detail. Very nicely done doco, particularly considering there's virtually no footage of the band - further evidence of how under-appreciated they were. The music remains wonderful - just wrong place, wrong time and wrong label.",1432252800,3,788,4.9772727272727275

5927092,2,B00EL6ABAI,"I love Big Star, especially ""#1Record"" and ""Radio City"", I still listen to these songs/ albums frequently. The range of emotions on display here,from pure joy and an exuberant love of making music to the moody, depressive, drug-fueled anguish,is palpable. Big Star worked through all these emotions on all their albums and brought the listener along for the ride.

""Nothing Can Hurt Me"" could serve as a decent introduction, for the unfamiliar, to this underappreciated cult band, who brought rock back to the basics: catchy songs without the bombast of that era's super popular stadium rock, no question.

However, for the longtime fan who already understands the influence this band had on 80's college rock, as well as on many other musicians, the DVD offers little.

Where is the concert footage? I kept getting excited when discussion of their studio work came up, thinking maybe there would be ACTUAL studio footage of the group. No, instead there are stills of the band in the studio, with discussion of insiders dubbed over the stills.
Interviews with drummer Jody Stephens were interesting, true, and through interviews with Bell's family we get a slightly improved picture of the illusive Chris Bell's personality and why he left the group. After all, had he stuck it out with Big Star, who knows, they could have eventually gone onto greater success. So, yes, some of the Chris Bell focused sections were more relevatory than anything else in this documentary, but there was scant new insight into Chilton over those pivotal years.

While I was thrilled at the idea of a Big Star documentary, this one, like so many other rockumentaries of today, is a disappointment with too many outsiders bloviating, but adding little of interest to the long time fan..

5927096,2,B00EL6ABAI,"I think this in one of those examples where a fan who had no idea how to make a film decided to do a kickstarted and make a film about a band they loved.

5927101,3,B00EL6ABAI,"Being a big fan of 1970's rock, I have to admit Big Star escaped my attention like millions of others.  It certainly seems they were in the right place at the right time to fuel their creativity.  Unfortunately, the billboard top 100 charts was long on very heavy rock and short on their abstract artistic stuff.  These guys appeared to be playing only what they felt like playing.  However, the undercurrent of drugs and emotional problems suggests they might not have been capable of keeping it together even if they had sold millions more records.",1391385600,,550,4.757894736842105

I believe it will be of interest to newcomers to the powerpop Gods, but mostly it will make the hardcore followers drool. It has been executed with love and passion and shows a great deal of respect.

8606578,4,B00EL6ABAI,"This is a fascinating tale of missed fame and creativity. A group of musicians gather and form a band called BIG STAR in the early 1970's, in Memphis, TN. When their first efforts come as a 45 single, it is lauded by many important music critics. But terribly, distribution on the record is poor and BIG STAR has a major setback at the beginning of their foreseen career. Also, they never recover from the early blunder. And the artists are frustrated and disillusioned from the music business and their own work. Overall, an extremely entertaining documentary with lots of insider interviews. I loved ever minute of it. 1 quibble: most of these reviewers and artists of that era (who have become old and fat) now, seem overly self-important.",1446854400,,742,4.8046875

Mostly in silhouettes as much is not known about them from a private perspective except for Alex Chilton.

Showcasing the wonderful and spell binding melodies and lyrics are interviews by those still living that knew these 4 talented musicians along with some old footage from some music sessions.  Chris Bell was my favorite member of Big Star and his tragic story is brought forth in its sorrow and pain of knowing that this musical genius went unnoticed for many years.

Sad to believe that only Jody Stephens is still on this side of of eternity.  Overall a much needed retelling of a true rock and roll tragedy.",1438732800,,885,4.683870967741935
