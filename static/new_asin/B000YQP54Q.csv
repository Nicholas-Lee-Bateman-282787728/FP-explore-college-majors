8233802,2,B000YQP54Q,"I LOVE Andy Griffith and am trying to watch everything he was in. Face In The Crowd was an incredible movie and probably his best acting job. No Time For Sergeants was funny and Andy did an excellent job as a country bumpkin. Of course, he was superb in The Andy Griffith Show. Now, to Strangers In 7A. Terrible movie. Cheaply made and the dialogue was awful. Andy was ok in it and I'm glad I was able to watch it, but I really can't recommend it unless you're a diehard Griffith fan. Ida Lapino was very good.",1357344000,,510,4.214285714285714
8233803,4,B000YQP54Q,"The TV drama STRANGERS IN 7A was first broadcast on 11/14/72.

In this nicely-crafted film, Andy Griffith and Ida Lupino are Artie and Iris Sawyer, a childless middle-aged couple. He's taking a correspondence course to become a mechanical engineer. She scoffs that he'll never amount to anything more than what he is: superintendant of an apartment building.

Andy stops at a bar one night and meets Claudine (Hildur), a young lady who claims to be homeless and without friends. She needs a place to stay for the night and the Super compassionately and rather foolishly offers the use of an apartment that's vacant for the weekend.

Immediately, Claudine's crazy Vietnam vet boyfriend Billy (Brandon), his explosives expert buddy Riff (Watson Jr.) and sadistic Virgil (McIntire) move in with the girl. When they sneak up to 7A to see what's going on, Artie and Iris are kidnapped, Artie is thrashed and they're both tied to chairs and gagged.

The three men have purposely chosen this building as a base of operations to breach the basement wall of an adjacent bank and rob its vault. They've already planted an armed time bomb in a newly opened safety deposit box; it's set to detonate at 9:30 pm. At 9, the break-in will begin. Billy and Virgil both have hair-trigger tempers and Billy is obviously nuts. Will the Sawyers survive the night?
