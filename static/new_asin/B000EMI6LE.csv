2523336,5,B000EMI6LE,Its the best comedy ever. Never disappointed with any of the trailer park boys videos. Wish they would still be making this series.,1356480000,,131,4.739130434782608
2523337,5,B000EMI6LE,"This video confirmed why we love the boys. As usual, we laughed all the way through. We can never get enough of the boys.",1347667200,,121,4.083333333333333
2523338,5,B000EMI6LE,"It's Trailer Park Boys! If you don't know who these guys are then you should because they're flipping hilarious! It does take a particular type of sense of humor to appreciate them, but if you have that type of funny bone these guys will have you laughing for hours and you'll find yourself watching them repeatedly. I own every episode and every movie they've done for exactly that reason, they're awesome dumb humor for those times you just want a dumb laugh with characters you'll get attached too. 5 Stars, two thumbs up!",1342915200,,525,4.655913978494624
2523339,5,B000EMI6LE,"If you're reading this review, it's likely you're already familiar with Trailer Park Boys Seasons 1-4. My word is: more of the same. Given the fact that seasons 1-4 are all hilarious, I consider that a very good thing indeed.

If, like me, you're from the 'States, you may not be familiar with the Trailer Park Boys. Buy it. The language is blue, they're constantly committing robberies and growing dope, and getting in shootouts. It's also funny as anything I've ever seen. I highly recommend this product, and any of the others in this series.",1287532800,2,545,4.7368421052631575
2523340,5,B000EMI6LE,"Nothing more needed to say, its the Trailer Park Boys!
If you like silly humor, and you don't mind a lot of fowl language, then this is your thing.
I love the Trailer Park Boys! Go Bubbles!",1277424000,2,189,4.135135135135135
2523341,5,B000EMI6LE,Season four is the best but this show to me is hillarious and the extras on the DVDs are funny as hell. Buy every season and the movie!,1214956800,4,135,3.857142857142857
2523342,5,B000EMI6LE,"I had heard a lot about this series from my sister. Skeptical, I gave season 1 a shot and found it funny enough to keep going. I'm glad I did. Once I had grown to understand the characters better (about mid-way through season 2), I was hooked. Each season has its best moments, but all of them are based in character and situation -- the perfect blend of comedy. This is not a show for everyone, but if you laugh at shows like The Office or Curb Your Enthusiasm, then you will not be sorry for devoting yourself to the adventures of Julian, Ricky, and one of the best characters ever created: Bubbles.",1195776000,9,601,4.327433628318584
2523343,5,B000EMI6LE,The only thing better than TPB is More TPB! I'm anxiously awaiting Season 6--the final season--and the DVD of the film.,1174176000,7,119,4.714285714285714

2523348,5,B000EMI6LE,"It doesn't get any better than trailer park boys. I can't wait for season 8 to get released. I bought these cause NETFLIX took it off its list, but has since been brought back. At lease now I don't have to worry about that anymore.",1384732800,,231,4.155555555555556
2523349,5,B000EMI6LE,"How do you not give trailer park boys 5 stars, This is the greatest tv series of all time. I own every thing the trailer park boys has made and its all 5 stars. yes I recommend this for everyone",1377561600,,194,3.875
2523350,5,B000EMI6LE,"This is really funny,it's real,not reality TV.Perfect backdrop,real people trying to exist. Julian with his ever present rum and coke,Ricky with his cigarette,Bubbles with his warm always considerate feelings for human kind. The girls moronic in a sweet way,the drunken Mr. Lahey and bareback Rand as his foil. JRock and Trevor unforgettable. It is what a comedy should be no canned laughter here,no expensive backdrop,no big name overpaid actors. No innuendo,sexual or otherwise. No pretentiousness or glossy air brushed plastic phony transparent nonsense. Original like The Three Stooges in a weird sort of way. These guys always make me laugh! I can watch the same sketches over and over and I see something new every time.",1374451200,,726,5.267241379310345
