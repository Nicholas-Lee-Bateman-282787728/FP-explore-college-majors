Its clearly an experimental film, one that at times feels like it would be more at home on a museum wall than in a movie theater.

A young man who seems to be able to see the future and read the minds of others, but who has no insight into or understanding of himself seeks treatment from a therapist in a vaguely futuristic world.  This simple story is presented in a very abstract and surreal way, with more than a hint of Godard (Alphaville especially).

On the down side the lead actor (Sebastian Saville) plays both the subject and the therapist (complete with a hopefully intentionally funny German accent for the latter).  This leads to all sorts of not very deep notions about being our own therapist, holding up a mirror to ourselves etc.  Its not helped that some of the psychiatrists dialogue are over-the-top new age clichs that probably sounded a lot hipper, deeper and fresher in 1979 when the film was made.

On the other hand, the film makes great use of images, boldly mixing very rough black and white video played back on monitors, often in step frame slow motion with beautifully shot color film images.  These images cover much the same thematic ground as the sometimes heavy dialogue, but do a much better job of making the ideas feel alive, vital, and often disturbing.

And not all the dialogue is bad.  There are some effective and creepy dialogue scenes, and interesting notions about the intersection of modern physics and the more metaphysical.  That element is just more variable, mixing cringe worthy moments with the thought-provoking ones.

In the end, I find that images and ideas have stuck with me, which is really all you can ask for this kind of film-making.  Its more interested in being challenging than entertaining, but for enough of its running time  for me  it managed to be both.  But very much a case of your mileage may vary.",1462060800,,2016,4.605042016806722
8354672,1,B0027FFSSU,"If you're looking for a movie that grabs you and pulls you in, this is NOT the one. The pace of the movie is deathly slow. The credits seem to take forever. You hope that the story will get moving when the opening credits end, but NO. Instead, there seem to be a never-ending stream of unclear, fragmented, incoherent ""television"" shots. Maybe this film has a plot that eventually becomes clear, but I didn't get that far. After about 20-25 minutes, I felt compelled to stop the DVD. Really a shame for an obscure and pricey movie!",1373587200,2,531,4.484536082474227
8354673,4,B0027FFSSU,"Since Einstein, we've had proof positive that we can't travel in time.

But, since ancient times, we've known you ""can't"" prove a negative proposition--at least not easily.

As a result, there are many tales of time travel. This is an intellectually interesting one with superb acting.

If you like to think about a world where what's past isn't done, and have time to kill,you could do far worse.",1359590400,,397,4.8088235294117645
