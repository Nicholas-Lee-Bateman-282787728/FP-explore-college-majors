What if Cannabis Cured Cancer?
A film by Len Richmond [...]
2629 Main Street  #116
Santa Monica, CA. 90405

$19.95 plus shipping

1 hour, narrated by Peter Coyote

While this position-paper film summarizes how and why cannabis became illegal, it goes beyond history to portray how cannabis works in the nervous system and, most importantly, research leads on its possible uses in treating a huge range of diseases.

After identifying the fact that the human nervous system has receptors for some of cannabis's plant chemicals, the film lists a huge number of healthy, normal human biological processes that are influenced by the naturally occurring endocannabinoids that our body produces. But when dysfunctions in this system happen, a large number of diseases can occur. In some cases, this dysfunction can be corrected and the diseases treated by stimulating these receptors with cannabis. If this begins to sound too scientific and confusing, What if Cannabis Cured Cancer? uses many helpful and clear graphics to clarify the ideas for the non-scientist.

While the title emphasizes cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, AIDS/HIV, menopausal cramps, schizophrenia, central nervous system diseases, and other illnesses make an appearance too. Current research is investigating these leads, and the ? mark in the title stresses that so far these are hot leads, not solidly established facts yet.  As for why these leads are not being avidly followed, the DEA, politicians, Government agencies, and the pharmaceutical companies take their editorial lumps.

This film should be shown to civic groups and community organizations, church groups, voter groups, health organizations, and in secondary schools and universities. City and university libraries should acquire this, and public TV stations would serve their publics well to broadcast it. Most importantly, it could well tip the balance away from well-meaning but ill-informed anti-cannabis populace toward an informed pro-cannabis electorate.

4189677,5,B003SSBSQQ,"This informative film tells you what drug companies and ""others"" don't want you to know about cannabis.  It has alot more  uses then smoking it.

4189678,5,B003SSBSQQ,"a chemical in weed called CBD slows cancer cells down by 50% by causing them to die early something about speeding up cell death which is actually healthy lol

4189681,5,B003SSBSQQ,Excellent history on cannabis and how and why it's been maligned for medical use.  Very informative and illustrative on exactly how cannabis works to complement our own endocannabinoid system.  I wish it had also mentioned the success that the doctors in Spain have had on glioblastoma.,1389312000,,286,5.195652173913044

brings new meaning to the phrase ""I take it for medicinal purposes only""...true..but it is also the world's most effective mood elevator as youdeal with other problems...namely you tend to forget about yesterday or tomorrow..sort of what Jesus strongly advises us all to do!..that's 'medicinal' all by itself right there.",1385164800,,449,5.617647058823529

4189687,5,B003SSBSQQ,"While I would like to see some counter-arguments from opponents of Cannabis, this show very clearly illustrated that the time has come to abandon the 70-year ban on Cannabis & Marijuana, decriminalizing both and encouraging valid scientific study of the potential benefits of this amazing plant and its extraordinary medicinal properties.

If only some of the claims made in this show are proven, then cannabis may well be the wonder-drug many suffering from debilitating disease are hoping for.",1366070400,,495,5.346153846153846

As an RN for 20 years I've never seen or heard of a single death, overdose, or negative reaction to cannabis other than mild paranoia (due to it's inaccurate illegal federal status).  Any patient of mine that only uses cannabis has no problem with general anesthesia vrs. alcohol, narcotics, & other ""street drugs"".  I'd rather have a cannabis patient over a drinker any day!

""What If Cannabis Cured Cancer"" is the best information you will get, whether you are pro or con. Treat yourself to those educated enough to teach you something. The stories of true life situations will leave you asking questions about cannabis and its uses for disease. This is not just drug war rhetoric or growers trying to make money.

4189694,3,B003SSBSQQ,"I was impressed with the information presented. This film makes a strong case for the medicinal uses of cannabis and the safety of it. Very few people know about the research that has been done showing that it can be as effective and in some cases more effective than prescription drugs for pain, inflammation, nausea, cancer, and many other ailments. Because of the stronghold that the pharmaceutical industry has over medicine and doctors and the resistance to alternatives that they cannot patent and that people could easily grow/make themselves, most of the information about the health benefits of cannabis have been suppressed. This film is worth watching for anyone with an interest in taking charge of his or her health and a desire to use natural, traditional, health supportive modalities.",1338854400,6,800,5.161538461538462
4189695,5,B003SSBSQQ,"I have been researching this issue of Marijuana as medicine and educating everyone who can benefit from its use.
This film is awe-inspiring, complete, entertaining and superbly presented.

Cannabis does cure Cancer!~Our government knows that Cannabis is the safest, non toxic Cancer cure on earth and this film explains specifically how the 421 compounds, found within the Cannabis plant, affect the human body.
THC is but One of the Four main cannabinoid compounds. This education is well worth the price of admission.

This film highlights many facets o medical cannabis including the medical use in the United States, prior to its demonization, in 1937.
It never once, preaches or berates. It is the most straightforward, fact-packed hour+ I have ever spent.

From interviews, with Physicians, scientists-a look into GW Pharmaceuticals, of the U.K and Paul Armentano from NORML as well as the results of experimentation of the therapeutic utility of Cannabis and the accompanying myriad health benefits.

I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a thorough education on the astounding benefits and overwhelming body of evidence to support this miracle plant.
I cannot wait to receive Len Richmond's other film ""Everything Bad is Good"" How to heal yourself........",1328745600,,1269,5.36180904522613
4189696,5,B003SSBSQQ,"The latest scientific research is revealing that not only is cannabis completely non-toxic and harmless, but cannabinoids kill cancer cells, reduce inflammation, slow the progression of Alzheimer's, are powerful antioxidants that protect brain cells from damage by free radicals, have antipsychotic properties, have antispasmodic properties, have novel antibiotic properties, etc.  Science trumps dogma once again!",1311984000,2,414,6.527272727272727

4189700,5,B003SSBSQQ,"As an old bat, cannabis was not much on my radar at all. (I saw prohibition to be destructive and wrongheaded, so I campaigned for others to have legal access to cannabis.) Then my husband was diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer. Suddenly my ethics became intensely personal!

My husband faced his 'death sentence' with no hope. His oncologist offered a letter to allow medical marijuana and I encountered this DVD title, ""What if Cannabis Cured Cancer"" researching the subject online.

The DVD arrived weeks before promised with a personal compassionate email from the producer. It gave details that were easy to understand for the non-scientific person. The clear medical information created a whole transformation for an old couple and the added political and historic information was an enjoyable embellishment . The video gave us hope for under $20.00.

Everything you wanted to know about cannabis, the potential for cure,  and much much more. Far from being a useless polemic, it answered our questions in a rich enjoyable format. Best purchase we ever made. Couldn't recommend it more highly.",1302739200,17,1100,5.128491620111732
4189701,5,B003SSBSQQ,"A family member was diagnosed with cancer.  When you hear that, you begin grasping for straws, especially when the doctors tell you there's not much hope.  This DVD talks about alternatives.  Cannabis may not be the ""holy grail"" cure, but it definitely needs much more research and recognition by the best labs/technicians in the world.  The current political climate and laws prevent easy access to cannabis for those who would look to it's healing properties, so a documentary like this is a very good starting point for those with an open mind.  There is something here that bears serious study and for those looking for an alternative to chemotherapy and other highly invasive procedures as practiced by the medical community, this DVD presents considerable food for thought.  Every doctor should watch this.  An open mind is the first step to discovery.",1302480000,4,858,5.042553191489362
4189702,5,B003SSBSQQ,This excellent documetary tells how cannabis not only can help alleviate the side-effects of chemotherapy but can actually reduce some tumors and cure other types of cancer.  Please watch this important film.,1302134400,3,208,5.5
4189703,5,B003SSBSQQ,"Truly, I wish that all of the members of our Govt would watch this film because maybe we could finally put an end to the idiotic prohibition of this amazing plant. It seems like many in power tend to ignore any and all evidence that the plant has incredible medical potential and jump on any hint that it may have some harmful side effect. This, in spite of the fact is has been used safely for thousands of years by humankind... Oh well, how much longer can the insane war against marijuana last as more and more people become educated on the subject? How much more harm must be done to good American citizens for making a safe medical or recreational choice before our policians finally do the right thing? I'm hoping things will change during the 2012 elections and that future generations will wonder why it was ever prohibited!",1299628800,2,832,4.553333333333334

In clear, simple to understand interviews and simple diagrams it covers why and HOW the basic compounds in Marijuana help you stay healthy. And how, if you are sick, how it helps you.  Without alarmist zealotry, it shows and explains both the supressed old research and the newest data on the multipule ways that it helps.  I was given a copy of the DVD to watch.  It so impressed me that I HAD to go online and buy my own copy.  I rarely buy anything on-line, but this film deeply impressed me.

4189712,5,B003SSBSQQ,"An excellent film! It will be hard for people to perpetuate the lies that made this holy plant illegal. For all of those who still believe that Cannabis (propaganda name: Marijuana)could be harmful, I suggest that you watch this. Make your decision when you have the FACTS. That's all I ask. And for those of us who believe in God, may I remind you of this:

And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)

God said, ""Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so."" And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. (Gen. 1:29-31)

He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; And wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shineth. (Psalm 104:14-15)
The Lord said unto me, ""I will take my rest and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches. (Is. 18:4-5)

And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. (Ezekiel 34:29)

(Jesus:) ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."" (Matt. 15:11)

One believeth that he may eat all things. Another...eateth herbs. ... Let us not, therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. (Epistle of St. Paul: Romans 14: 2,3,13,14,17)

Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereupon thou hast attained. (Paul: 1 Timothy 4:1-6)

And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielding her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. (Rev. 22:1-2)

It is a flower, made by God himself, who makes all things good. Do you know better than God? Watch this and decide for yourself. $20 for so much information is a steal!",1285459200,4,3776,4.277310924369748
