I was annoyed that buying this tape was like buying a pig in a poke because I had no idea which episode it would be. It appears to be the pilot episode since a lot of time is spent establishing who is who--a good thing if you are buying the tape without having ever seen the show before.

George Segal, Maggie Han and Josh Mostel are excellent actors at top form here. Some of the dialog is good and snappy, and the plot is OK, but, otherwise, I expect that this is mostly of interest to those who remember seeing ""Murphy's Law"" when it was originally aired.

I wish my favorite two-part episode, the one with the character named Miss De Sade, would become available on tape or DVD, but I gather that this pilot episode is all there is.

Which leads me to my real complaint. This tape contains only one episode. A VHS tape can easily hold two episodes, but this tape gives you very little for your bucks. What is worse, the episode was recorded at extended play (EP) speed, not the better quality standard play (SP). My VCR, at least, played the whole tape all the way through with a narrow but noticeable strip of snow or static at the top of the picture.

If copies of this tape exist with better quality, I do not know, but this one at least appears to be in its original box with the original label on the cassette itself, suggesting authorized manufacture. Now, I have seen inconsistency in labeling on recorded media before, but here we have the box label: ""Running Time 90 Minutes"" and the label on the cassette itself: ""Approx Run Time 100:39,"" which means either 100 minutes and 39 seconds or possibly 60 minutes and 39 seconds (which would properly be rendered 1:00:39). I did not time it, but the actual run time is much closer to the 60 minute mark. Was the labelling a mistake or is the cassette itself doctored? I can't tell for sure. The cassette at least looks original to me, which means it was originally recorded at EP speed to save money on the footage of tape used on each unit, completely at the expense of quality. That stinks.",1221264000,,2160,4.417085427135678
