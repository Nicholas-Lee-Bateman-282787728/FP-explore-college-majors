8395044,4,B003DZAME8,"This is a nice, economical set featuring three cracking Billy Wilder/Jack Lemmon collaborations on as many single-sided discs (perhaps 'The Fortune Cookie,' 'Irma la Douce' and 'The Front Page' will constitute a second volume?).  The only caveat here is that, despite the use of updated cover art for 'The Apartment' and 'Some Like It Hot,' all three DVDs contain the same inferior transfers (and nominal extras) that appear on their original (2001-2003) MGM releases.  That aside, it's a great, space-saving way to own a trio of timeless comedies from two top talents.  'Hot' rates 4 1/2 stars, 'Apartment' 4-plus and 'Avanti!' 4-minus; picture/audio averages out to a decent but wanting 3 1/2; and reasonably priced package levels the whole affair somewhere near an aggregate 4.",1352160000,3,780,5.224
