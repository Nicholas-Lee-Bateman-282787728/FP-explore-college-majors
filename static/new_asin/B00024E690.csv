8022025,5,B00024E690,Good Christmas for my lil nephew. Ill make like Popeye as much as I do. I got him a few more Popeye dvds too.,1387411200,,109,3.5833333333333335
8022026,3,B00024E690,This DVD is ok! Its cheap price but video encoding isn't all that great. Alot of the audio is not synced to the video. Better idea is just to download the vids ur self and burn them. Alot of these old cartoons are no longer copyrighted anymore so there people out there who make there own Dvds of them and sell them and I think that is the case with this cheaply made DVD.,1331337600,,372,4.04054054054054
