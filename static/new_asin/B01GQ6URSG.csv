8763300,4,B01GQ6URSG,"This is a really nice family friend film about a mother and daughter who live in Agra, India. The mother, Chanda, works several jobs including as a maid to a rich family who treat her well. Her daughter, Appu, is in her last year of high school (10th standard in India's system) and she is not motivated to do well or graduate because she sees only a life of poverty ahead of her. The daughter is smart but does not care to use her brains for higher education. As the story unfolds, her mother tries to convince her that there are more opportunities than being a maid, and with the help of her employer, who is open-minded, kindly and understanding, Chanda sets her sights on helping her daughter understand the value of education and, most of all, of believing in oneself. With excellent direction by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, superb acting by Swara Bhaskar, Ratna Pathak and Riya Shukla, and several fun songs, Nil Battey Sannata is a contemporary film with depth, heart, and a delight for viewers of all ages.",1475107200,,1007,4.6
