8028833,5,B0002LGWY0,"I first saw this movie in 1967 on the late night local movie, never saw it again. I never forgot about the movie and was glad that I found it on amazon by sheer chance. I couldn't remember all the movie so in a way it was like watching a new movie. I did remember the part where our hero is hiding in that hole from the heavy German armored company. I think anyone who likes old movies will enjoy it, and the surprise ending. Maybe amazon will uncover another French movie I saw on tv in 1967 "" The Bear "" it is about a lovesick talking bear.",1384646400,3,542,3.981651376146789
8028834,4,B0002LGWY0,"This was my second time watching this movie, my first time was almost 50 years ago when I first started to learn French.  It is spoken in French with English subtitles.  The movie is about a French prisoner of war who uses the prop of a ""borrowed"" cow to make it through all sorts of complicated and often comical situations to escape from Germany and make it back home to his beloved France.  As a German who grew up in post-war Germany in the border region between the two countries, the story was especially interesting and endearing to me.  The acting is superb and the relationship that develops between Marguerite (the cow) and this prisoner is touching and funny.  Unfortunately (for me, at least) the film is in black &white, something to get used to after all these years.",1384473600,5,781,4.589928057553957
