557437,4,6303085466,"This is another video from the Firm's third Body Sculpting system which uses the 3 in 1 Firm Box which can be used in a 6 inch position for aerobics, 14 inches for leg press, or in a incline position to up the intensity for aerobics and to be used for lunges.  If you do not have the box a normal step will work, you will also need a pair of light weights.

The workout in it's entirety is about 30 minutes.  Lisa Kay leads this workout with 4 of her fellow master instructors, one of which always shows beginner modifications. Lisa has led a handful of videos and does a good job in this one as always.

There are 4 cardio segments aside from the warmup and cooldown. The first 3 use the box in the 6 inch position. The first segment features step knees, repeaters, V-steps, jacks etc. The second is more of a 4 limb section using light weights but using the box more as well. There are dips, squats, and other moves incorporated with shoulder work using the light weights. I used 3 lb weights and my heartrate was plenty high, I would say this is the most difficult segment in the workout, at least it was for me. The third section features A-steps, L-steps over the tops, turn steps, and other moves, this is probably the trickiest combination and may take a few tries to get down. The fourth segment is more 4 limb using the box in the incline position. You will do lunges onto the incline with some bicep curls, then some dips with biceps etc.

By the time you have reached the cooldown you have definitely worked, and will be glad it's the end, they make the most of 30 minutes that's for sure. All in all a short but solid cardio workout. The music is good and it will keep you going until the end. Most Firm fans will like this one.",1112486400,16,1740,4.244712990936556
557438,5,6303085466,"I was one of the original ""Firm Believers.""  I bought each over-priced tape months before it was available.  And ... I have to admit ... I did get results.

But then ... something happened.  The tapes were too long for me to fit into my time-crunched mornings.  The endless lunges, high impact, and other unsafe moves started to bother my joints, and the endless tall box climbs made my butt and legs bulk too much.  The extremely rehearsed quality and the Stepford Wives-ish instructors bored me.  I tried other tapes and discovered Gin Miller, Kari Anderson - tapes that were fun, that didn't make my joints hurt - and quickly traded away all my ""classic"" firms, except for Volume 4 and the Tracie Long ones.

Recently I've heard so much about how the ""new"" firms were so different than the ""old"" firms.  Much of the talk has been negative.  But I began to think, if the new Firms are so different, then maybe I'd like them.

The first one I tried is Super Body Sculpt with Stephanie Corley.  I LOVED THIS!  In some ways, it is very different than the original Firms.  The set is bright, Crunch-like (large fans in the walls), and very clean.  The instructor and co-exercisers are not Stepford-like at all - they seem more like the (buff) girls next door.  There are no ta-da's, flourishes, ""rodeo"" moves, ""dork dances"" or other moves that would make you feel silly or self-conscious doing this in front of someone else.  And Stephanie's cuing is excellent.

The tape is divided into three sections.  All toning - no cardio.  Each section has a warm-up and cool-down.

The first 15 minute section is upper body.  They suggest 3, 5, and 8 lb weights, which would provide a good intermediate workout.  The second time I did this, I used 5, 8, and 10 lb weights.  It's not the toughest upper body workout I've ever done, but it does feel like a quality workout, working your different muscle groups evenly.  They use the ""fanny lifter"" to do pushups - I did the pushups on the floor, as it felt better to my wrists.  They also did most of the upper body work seated on the fanny lifter - a chair would also work.  I liked doing it seated as it allowed me to concentrate and use heavier weights.

The next 15 minute section is lower body.  They used medium (5 lb.) and heavy (8 lb.) weights; I swapped up to 8 lb. weights for most exercises and 10 lb. weights for the squats.  You do need a low step for some of the exercises and a high step or fanny lifter for two sets of tall box climbs.  These exercises struck me as much safer and easier on my joints than old Firms - for examples, lunges are done with one foot on the low step.

The third 10 minute section is abs.  This seemed to be pretty decent - although I'll probably skip this section in the future, as I do a lot of Pilates for this area.

This is a tape that packs quite a lot into a short time.  I definitely see myself using this in the future - as a 30 minute upper and lower body workout, or using individual sections as ""add-ons"" to other tapes.",1105142400,29,3012,4.356115107913669
557439,5,6303085466,"I love the variety and cool steps in this workout. I don't have the bar, but I use weights instead with good results. It is advertised as 30 minutes, but it's actually 40.

Each section has a warm up & cool down.  Each section is approx 15 mins! Love the ab routine.  The only thing is that you need the Fanny Lifter (The Firm's 3 in 1 Step) to do it right.

I needed a step for the Jillian Michaels workout so I found a used firm step and decided to purchase the dvds as well. I was not expecting a traditional step workout. She moves quite quickly and does not give you time to grasp each move. However, this is a fat burning workout for sure. I think it will take 2 or 3x and then you can master it. My hubby did the workout and enjoyed it as well, so that's a plus! I deducted the one star because of the instruction.

You can change your workout to make it as easy or difficult as you like by increasing or decreasing your step height, moving across the floor instead of using the step, using heaver or lighter weights, or no weights at all.

557539,5,6303085466,"I am giving this video 5 stars because it has quickly become my favorite 30-minute workout!  Yes, the criticisms mentioned in other reviews are valid - sometimes tricky footwork, less than ideal cueing (mainly with regard to which foot is leading), meh music - but it's still an excellent short workout and it's a bargain.  It did take me about 6 sessions to get the footing down even though I have been doing Firm workouts for years and so already know all of the basic moves.  But as it turns out, that is what I like most about this video - every move counts so you get a full-body workout in 30 minutes.  In between the warm-up and cool-down there are 4 cardio segments all using the box (you need one that has the ability to safely incline) and 2 of the segments also use light weights (I recommend 3 lbs).  As with any Firm workout, there are plenty of squats, lunges and dips.  There are also the typical ""box"" moves like A-steps, V-steps and turn-steps.  The weights are used for arms and core strength.  If you are looking for a short, full-body cardio workout - give this one a try!",1334534400,6,1092,4.398009950248756

557594,4,6303085466,"This is an intense workout, surprising considering how short it is. You will definitely get your heart rate up and work the whole body. HOWEVER, I was disappointed in a few things. I love the Firm, but with this workout, the cues were TERRIBLE. I've been doing step for years and am good at advanced choreography, even teaching it at the gym for a few years, but this wasn't good. She would say, ""Five repeaters,"" and do 6, throwing you off completely. She would start and stop on the wrong legs, say ""repeater right,"" only to mean repeaters on the right side of the box with the left leg. Huh? Very confusing choreography. But you can still get a good workout if you just keep moving and try to  pick back up.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because it is intense, even if the cues and choreography are sub-par.",1247788800,2,810,4.3933333333333335

557599,4,6303085466,"I do not understand the complaints that the cuing on this DVD is not adequate.  There are approximately 4-5 routines on the whole video.  The instructor takes you through each step.  The only time there is difficulty is on a ""step over"" the step which does appear complicated and is hard to follow due to the camera angles. However, this DVD for 35 minutes, taxes the exerciser. If you are a beginner, this is not for you.  However, it is great for the intermediate to advance exerciser.  There are balancing exercises that make you push yourself.  You need light weights; she does aerobic work without them, but there are 2 routines that require them.  I think this is one of the better short workouts the Firm produces.  Given the low price, I recommend that this one be purchased.",1175385600,11,783,4.6231884057971016
557600,5,6303085466,"This is a truly enjoyable workout. I really liked it a lot. When I was done I went on to do an ab workout.  You sweat, but its not that hard. You can increase the difficulty to your level, so that's why I gave it 5 stars. Plus  I want to do it again, which is always a good sign!  I am glad I bought the Box, (or whatever they call this thing) I have the Fanny Lifter and debated if I should get the new device or not. Now I have the incline, and the next day I felt muscles deeep inside I didn't even know I existed!

If you are advanced or even intermediate, you will probably want to do another tape targeting a specific body part, like abs, arms or whatever. But your butt will be looking hot after this one!

Stephanie Huckabee is very pleasant. She's simply instructing well, there's no ""whooohoos"" or other corny remarks. Just business, yet upbeat and inspiring.  If you don't like an instructor, you're simply not going to like the tape. Her personality is likeable and unobtrusive.

The only negative is that there was no ab section, and I would have liked more weights.  The whole FIRM series was based on the combo of cardio with weights, so it seems they've moved away from the ""founding fathers"".

Still, I love FIRM videos in general, and hope they'll up the ampage again with the workouts and also, more importantly, improve the technology. They have to include chapters to navigating their DVDs.  Menu, chapters, navigation! Come'on guys!!! You can do it! (heh)

ps- if anyone has any ab specific DVDs that they love, let me know. Or other cross trainer type DVDs... I want to try some others if the Firm is going to slack off.",1172448000,4,1643,4.3894389438943895

This video has fast-paced & upbeat music, a little tricky choreography at first, and is definately a challenging workout for an intermediate exerciser.  I use the Transfirmer system without any problems instead of the system shown on the box.  Lisa Kay gives good cues and is perky enough to keep you going but not annoying.  My one complaint is that they don't do a good job of showing the low impact alternative (Libby).  Several times she wasn't shown until after several repetitions of the movement.  You can't see her for much of the workout because she is off to the side.  All in all it is a good workout video.",1151020800,4,808,4.531034482758621

7837066,5,6303085466,"Really got something out of this one. Its about 36 minutes total, has a long warm up and a decent cool down. I think the actual workout is about 20-25 minutes. However, I do not have the Fanny Lifter product but I easily made do without it. You do need a series of hand weights though. Light, medium, heavy. They don't tell you what those should be. I used 10s, 12s. I considering myself an intermediate/advanced in ability. As far as intensity (I MODIFIED, NOTED BELOW) goes, based on how I modified... I would say this was 21 Day Fix, 21 Day Fix Extreme, Cathe Friedrich in likeness.

Pros: the cuing in this is probably the best I've heard from The Firm as fair and warning of transitions, counting, flow into next moves. I've done about 8 or 9 so far of Firm workouts and several from this Body Sculpting System series. Above cuing was the form instruction, it probably is the best I've heard from them so far. That said, while the form explaining was good - it wasn't Autumn Calabrese, Chalean Johnson, or Cathe Friedrich good but close. I liked the moves, not too dancy. I have 2 left feet and I will probably have the routine down by the 2nd or 3rd. There was enough time to switch out weights, the moves were slow enough to hit form before shifting on. I like a longer warm up but others don't. I thought that was great.

Cons: The only thing that jumps out is they want you to rest your weights on your shoulders and that really is uncomfortable for me with 10s/12s. But I just carried down by sides in hands, no issues with keeping up or feeling like I changed the intensity somehow.

Modifications: I made this for what I would consider closer to advanced. I don't have the Fanny Lifter which is 14 inches tall and 4 or 6 for the short. I have an Original Step which would have worked just fine. Though you would have to change your or the Step's orientation to do the moves since some are in front of the step, to the side, and rear. But totally doable, I think. However, the height would pose a problem if you want the full 14 inches of work. That said, I have a step stool of sorts that I can stow tools in. (Actually stows some workout bands/loops stuff.) I found one something similar by doing a search on Amazon (Stand 'N Store Step Stool with Storage) the dimensions are near identical to the tall Fanny Lifter. My personal one (different brand) is 13.9 inches. I used that the entire time for the workout. So when they were down at 4 or 6 I was always at ~14. This got me huffing and puffing, particularly lifting with 10s/12s lbs weights. If you are a beginner or advanced beginner you can do this workout. If you are intermediate/advanced exerciser you can make this work well. I will absolutely use this again and again.",1490054400,,2742,4.362035225048924
