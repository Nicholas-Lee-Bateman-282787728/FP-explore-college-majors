The music is legendary and the video is a window into the 60's and into the roots of popular music, fashion etc. The plot is rather silly, but this video is a  collectors item. the plot doesn't matter.

715540,5,6303823351,"The picture quality on the Blu Ray is fantastic! This film might be something that someone today might watch and not enjoy, but the historical importance of this film and the large shadow it cast over the next twenty years of music and culture is undeniable. When this film came out, everyone watched it and heard the songs. There will never be a musical group that so influenced everyone of their generation.
Personally, I love this film and it reminds me of my early childhood. I like Help! more than A Hard Days Night. The use of bright colors, great camera shot composition and exotic locales make the film visually stunning. The Beatles and Richard Lester really improved on their lifting of The Goon Show humour and in retrospect, it is obvious how much The Monkees and Monty Pythons Flying Circus tv shows were influenced by Help!. Of course, the best part of the movie is the songs; and The Beatles really started to excel beginning with Help!, with their songs becoming more mature and timeless.
I highly recommend this Blu Ray to see the greatest rock band ever at their peak, even if the film has some rather silly bits sometimes.",1511049600,4,1141,4.653465346534653

The director calls Help! a ""Pop Art fantasy."" It was written at the end of 1964, and the director's intro in the booklet enclosed puts the film into its cultural context. The second intro is by Martin Scorsese, and his insights are well worth having too.

The locations are arbitrary and delightful. I especially loved the scene of the Beatles skiing and playing in the snow in the Austrian Alps.  It was also exhilarating to watch them perform on a scrubby beach in the Bahamas and on a field on Salisbury Plain.

Two stars for the plot. Five stars for the Beatles and the films production values.",1490745600,4,799,4.685714285714286

With current times so troubling I decided to take a few hours and indulge in pure escapism, back to the days of my early youth in the mid-60s when it seemed Ed Sullivan was our president.

I laughed from start to finish and this film is both a perfect musical time capsule and a timeless romp.

Director Richard Lester was well known as a master of sight gags, on-screen zaniness and clever repartee. Partnered with the 1965 Beatles plus an astute cast and crew, he helped create a wonderful piece of alchemy with a great soundtrack. The kooky plot and lineup of character actors provides a delightful foil for the Beatles songs that comprise the soundtrack. It would be hard to have a film like this be more perfect.",1482105600,,803,4.486301369863014

716162,5,6303823351,"Review of the Beatles Help! On Blu Ray.
Im a bit late in buying this, but my initial reaction was when the audio at the very beginning of Help (the song) came on I knew this was (for me) the quintessential audio version. Having a 7.1 Surround sound tuner, it was amazing. I almost had a stroke when they started to throw the darts at the Beatles playing the song Help; on their monitor because it gave the illusion that they were coming out of my sofa and on to the screen in 3D. To my knowledge this movie is not in 3D nor do I currently own a 3D TV. The first fifteen minutes of this Blu Ray Disc first released on June 25th, 2013, essentially gave me the information I needed to know in comparing it to the regular DVD version released on November 6th, 2007. So Beatle people this is definitely a must have!",1463097600,,810,4.165605095541402

The extras are hard to use, you must menu through everything, no play all, and they are all mostly crap (except for Sir George Martin, who is always great, but it is so hard to find his stuff it is not worth it).

716392,3,6303823351,"First off, I'm a huge Beatles fan and every time a new ""definitive"" or ""deluxe"" or ""fully restored"" version of their music or films comes along, I save up and buy it. Most recently, the new Mono vinyl boxed set.

I bought the Help! DVD back in 2007, and was thrilled. It beat the pants off of my VHS copy (of course): Widescreen, a new transfer from the 35mm Film negative, color corrected, digitally restored. It was beautiful.

Now in 2013, the Blu-Ray comes along with the hype sticker, ""Fully Restored HD Picture!"" Great!! This should look just as fantastic as the Fully Restored ""Honeymooners"" or ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Blu-Ray restorations which are all jaw-dropping in sharpness and clarity. All of those went back to the original 35mm Negatives for a new transfer and a new master on to Blu-Ray.

Boy, was I disappointed. First of all, the copyright on the disc is 2007 - same as the DVD. The packaging is IDENTICAL to the DVD, except the special features are now all on the same disc with the movie. But the real disappointment didn't hit until I actually played the movie. This is clearly an up-converted DVD transfer, and it painfully shows.

There is absolutely no detail in the wide shots. If I didn't already know, I wouldn't be able to tell which Beatle is which. Trees, grass, sand, any fine details are all smeared together. But it doesn't end there: there's terrible video distortion as a result of the up-conversion. Aliasing (jagged lines) on the titles, ""screen door"" effects on clothing, and the fine pinstripes on Paul's suit seem to get sharp and then blur away in the same shot. There is also an over abundance of artificial ""edge enhancement"" going on, especially in the Swiss Alps scenes where the Beatles are skiing in black outfits on white snow. Everyone is outlined in a white halo. I even noticed some interlacing around the lips and teeth as they were singing.

If you already own the DVD like I do, save your money on this one. You're just buying the EXACT SAME transfer on a different disc. Even the Magical Mystery Tour Blu-Ray looks far clearer and better than this, and that was shot mostly on 16mm rather than 35mm if I'm not mistaken.

3 stars for the overall content and packaging (however identical) but minus 2 stars for the deceptive ""HD 1080p"" hype.
Let's hope someone does a proper transfer of this like they did with A Hard Day's Night.",1442880000,13,2412,4.6370023419203745

716503,5,6303823351,"Help! is a film directed by Richard Lester. It features The Beatles  John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr  together with Leo McKern, Eleanor Bron, Victor Spinetti, John Bluthal, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill. It was the second feature film made by the Beatles and is a comedy adventure which sees the group come up against an evil cult. The soundtrack was released as an album entitled Help!.

The Beatles again aim for a mix of goofy comedy and sterling pop music. A sacred ruby ring comes into Ringo's possession, attracting the unwelcome attention of an exotic religious cult and forcing the boys to go on the run. This chase narrative is thankfully never taken too seriously, serving mainly as an excuse for colorful excursions to international locations from Europe to the Bahamas. The musical numbers include such classic tunes as ""Ticket to Ride"",""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and ""Help!"".

This is already a dated musical comedy but it can still be a fun romp with the legendary Beatles as it provides great music and entertainment. Obviously,loyal Beatles fans will overlook the flaws this movie has and will still rate it excellently satisfying. Finally,it also shows the Beatles' skill in comedy aside from singing and songwriting.",1430870400,,1274,5.052380952380952

It's slightly distorted, but should be ultra clean HD, if it's really from the 4K master?

HELP BluRay, video is Distorted (not severe, the color is good, but the video has some distortion and not as sharp as it could be, it looks like interlace distortion)?

I'm a Digital Media, Production and Post Production expert for Film, TV, Mobile and Web.....

So I bought the HELP BluRay and though the color looks very good, the video encode is distorted, lines are blurred, like lips, fine lines and etc., which should be sharp?  It looks like it was converted from an HD 1080i / interlace, so you see the interlace distortions?

It would have been far, far better to encode from the 4K Digital Master to BluRay, which I can do that for them (I do this sort of stuff daily).  The image quality result would be astounding, rather than this almost mediocre version, it's certainly far better than VHS, but not best quality HD that it could be.  The average/most people may not see it.... I've even spoken to people that are excited by BluRay's BECAUSE THEY CAN GET DVD'S CHEAPER NOW (I'm not talking to those people, I've gotta have at least BluRay, though I'm waiting for 4K Players and Optical Discs to start showing up... that will be awesomest!!!!!).

Thank you for the BluRay, I love it...

Sincerely,

There's also no denying that this movie's storyline is unbelievably dumb. Ringo wears a ceremonial ring that's needed by a cult to make human sacrifices, so the cult members spend the movie trying to rip the ring off Ringo's finger. But that didn't matter so much to me as a kid either. What mattered was the Beatles' rapidly evolving ability to craft incredible music that rose far above the typical pop and top 40 fare, and this film's crazy-expensive travelogue of nonsensical location shoots (swimming in the Bahamas one scene, skiing in the Alps the next?). The extras are nice too, and the Blu-Ray's crisp quality and awesome audio remix make it a joy to watch. Worth the price of admission: The townhouse where the lads live, and the track they sing during the scene, ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.""",1403568000,,962,4.6647058823529415

Although it came out in 1965, I remember watching it in the early 70's at the repertory theatres; then came the beta, then VHS then DVD.  I have to admit watching it on Blu-Ray on a big screen TV truly added to the experience, enjoying all over again.  I also liked the extras and some of the background including the missing scene that starred Wendy Richard (from: Are you being served) a woman who never got credit because the scene was cut out.

I still have to laugh at the radio jingles of the day promoting the movie. bad?  yes, but I still had to chuckle.

A much different story with the Beatles attempting to act in a plot that's not just following them around. Great songs including the Beatles, ""You're Gonna Lose that Girl"" which was their last ""A Hard Day's Night"" type of song. The story is fun and you can try and pick out which scenes where they're ""stoned"" having discovered Mary Jane which they puffed while filming. Your kids will never know since the entire movie is goofy. I like their early, ""rum and coke"" era songs much better than their later stuff and this is the last album that contains some of those.",1391299200,2,659,4.5

I can only go off of what I noticed since I watched it with her.  I have only ever seen the movie twice. Once when it happened to be on AMC years ago and the second streamed off of the internet. So to me the quality of this DVD is pretty amazing.

717398,5,6303823351,Anyone who was alive in the 60's will remember the impact the Beatles had on us.  A band that was well managed by Brian Epstein made us feel like we knew them.  Would love to have had them over for dinner.  Countless garage bands formed because really....who wouldn't want to be a Beatle with 1000's of girls screaming at them.  The music still remains my favorite.,1388880000,,365,4.484848484848484
717399,5,6303823351,"Although I had this film many years ago on video, I had never seemed to replace it with a DVD copy. I am so glad I did, as not only is the film great fun, but this 2 DVD set has some great extras. It was the film where Lennon complained the Beatles were 'extras' in their own movie and the middle of their love affair with pot, which saw them giggling throughout and testing Director Richard Lester to the limit. However, Lester was a wise man, who had already had a great success with the documentary style ""A Hard Day's Night"" and he wisely knew both the Beatles talents and their limitations. With a bigger budget, colour film and a cast of actors to help carry them, he created a fun and zany romp, even if the plot was a little weak. With the Beatles providing the music, what could go wrong?

If the plot itself (an Eastern cult is unable to carry out their ritual sacrifice, as Ringo has been given the ring, leading to them being chased around various locations - you can almost hear Brian Epstein's relayed requests, ""the boys have never been ski-ing"" and ""can we film in the Bahamas?!"" - with Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear as a mad scientist and his assistant in hot pursuit) is not strong, the music is wonderful and Lester manages to almost invent the music video out of necessity. Ringo having shown his acting talent in their first movie is wisely given the main part and has natural, comic timing. The other Beatles, although apparently unable to learn their lines, manage to be adequate at least and the entire film has a really good feel about it.

There is a whole DVD of extras to enjoy as well, with a thirty minute documentary on ""The Beatles in Help!"" including interviews with Richard Lester and other members of the cast and crew, as well as a section of ""Memories of Help!"" which could probably have been included in the documentary. At long last, Richard Lester explains why he cut the missing scene with Frankie Howard and Wendy Richard, there is information on the restoration of the film and some original film trailers. This is a good package, with interesting extras and the film lovingly restored and it has stood the test of time well.",1388534400,,2170,4.491139240506329

Seriously the boys two films were good-they actually had a storyline and a innocence that seemed natural. They were even nominated for some awards. But as Ed Sullivan showed their music was good enough you really didn't need a movie [it was just icing on a cake], just film them singing and the theaters would sell out.
I don't need to reverberate everything said already in detail, all the songs were great. The transfer came out really good and really has something ""extra"" if you convert to 3D. And the sound can be extremely good with the right equipment.
One final thing I remember about ""Help"" was some interviewer asking John when they would make their next movie. He said, ""This is it, after all, we're not actors we're musicians.""

717821,4,6303823351,"This review is from: The Beatles - Help! [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
In ""Help!"" The Beatles second film the band seem almost like guest stars or an after thought in this comedy inspired by The Goons and the satirical pop art stylings of director Richard Lester. There's more of a story here but it hardly revolves around the band themselves focusing on the MacGuffin-like Ring that Ringo sports on his hand and that proves to be essential to an Eastern cult's practice; whomever wears the ring will have his or her throat cut. It's a pretty dark subject matter for a film that spoofs everything from the James Bond films to films starring pop stars.

Truly bizarre at times and clearly influencing Monty Python's Flying Circus, ""Help!"" Is a fascinating mixture of the surreal and whimsical with some terrific songs from the band. Even when some of the gags in the film don't quote work, the band manages to sell them with their charm and charisma.

The Blu-ray looks looks extremely good but there are certain digital artifacts suggesting that this might be an older HD transfer. That's not necessarily a bad thing as most folks won't notice these artifacts and some won't see them at all. Colors are bold and the detail is quite nice throughout with film grain not buried under heavy handed digital noise reduction.

The lossless surround track sounds very nice depth and presence particularly during the musical interludes which visually clearly influenced MTV a decade later. The 5.1 mix can't match a contemporary film that was intended for exhibition in that format. The presentation is clear with remarkably detail for a film that is 48 years old.

The special features included here are exactly the same as the DVD edition.

We get the three featurettes on the film with one focusing on the makong of the film, one on the restoration done for the previous 2007 release for the The Beatles in Help! (480i; 29:34) is a well done overview with interviews and some fun behind the scenes footage of The Beatles and one with the surviving cast and crew discussing their memories of working on the project. We get a single deleted scene o traduced by Wendy Richard, theatrical trailers in English and Spanish as well as radio spots cleverly hidden in the menus.

All the special features are in 480i (it would have been nice to see them upgraded to 1080p).

As with the previous edition we get reproductions of the posters and lobby cards in the digipak and a booklet with notes on the film by director Richard Lester and an appreciation by director Martin Scorsese.

On the whole the presentation here is an Improvement over the DVD but there really isn't anything new in terms of special features so be aware of that. ""Help!"" Is a fun film and looks eye popping on its high def transfer.",1372204800,7,2781,4.731404958677686

When the music sequences are played, which is of course the most important it is fantastic. Dynamic, crystal clear sound with no one instrument drowning out the other. Ticket to Ride has always been my favorite on this soundtrack. Paul's bass and backing vocals mixed with John's lead vocal sound like never before. The 5.1 comes through loud and incredibly clear.

This was my first Beatle movie I saw and I loved it.  I recorded it in Beta when it was shown on tv, then when the Beta was released I got that, then I recorded it in VHS and got it on VHS, then it came out on DVD and I got it on DVD THEN when they re did the whole thing once more, one big boxed package where they cropped the top and bottom of the screen to make it look like widescreen I got it again!

It is MY favorite movie and I have fond memories of seeing it the first time when I was 11 years old, my mom took me to the drive in not letting me know she was going to do it.  I will be 60 this year and I can still vision the whole thing clearly.  It's a long story so I won't bother you with it.

IF you are a TRUE 1st generation fan you know you HAVE to get it, for everyone else, this is and always will be a great movie.  I can watch this over and over and over again and still laugh.  I can also still hear my mother's laughter in all the right places.

Considering the hard work that went into producing the 2007 DVD, I'm sure the restoration team must have prepared a hi-def master for this movie.  So, I'm hoping that Apple releases a blu-ray of this.  And, If the releases of Yellow submarine and Magical Mystery tour are any indication of things to come, I'm sure this will happen before too long.

717900,3,6303823351,"I was a kid when ""Help!"" hit the big screen, and remember that as a Beatles fan, I was put off by how dumb the story was and how long it took to tell it.  Truly, this is a pretty terrible movie but very much of its time, with that op art visual sensibility and a feeble attempt at the disjointed ""Hard Days Night"" styling.  John, Paul, George and Ringo come off very well, and the rest of the cast is professional and good; but honestly, ""Help"" is lousy.

For the one person reading this review who never saw ""Help!"", it involves an Eastern religious cult that wants to murder Ringo because he's accidentally wearing their sacrificial ring.  The wily Beatles are chased all over England and the Bahamas, and good wins out in the end; but who really cares?  You watch this for up-close-and-personal images of the Beatles, the great music and the fun.  Unfortunately, for this viewer, there is too little of the latter to justify the rest, which is a bunch of fine English character actors you'd like to boo off the screen so you can get back to the Beatles.

I'd rather watch ""A Hard Days Night"" or maybe just reminisce about how wonderful the Beatles were to pre-pubescent girls all over the world.  ""Help!"" is just plain stupid.",1360454400,,1229,4.479820627802691

I remember it being so much funnier - but then the last time I saw it was when it first came out.  Despite the disappointment with this aspect of the dvd, I must say it was worth every penny for the music.  Took me back to their glory days - and mine.  If you love their music, buy it and disregard the movie - you just can't get dvd's of their concerts, and if you could all you'd be able to hear would be screaming anyway.",1337990400,,601,4.025210084033613

I am only nineteen years old and am a relatively new Beatlemaniac but I knew I just had to have my very own copy of Help!

The plot of Help! is silly, whimsical and provides a wonderful insight into the personalities of each Beatle. The film also paints a lovely picture of the relationship between the four Beatles, with their inside jokes and teasing of one another. This is the Beatles at their very best, a MUST SEE.

It's a full screen dub with clean HiFi mono audio that switches to stereo for songs.

The movie HELP! (UK-1965) was created during a turning point in the careers of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. It was here they fully broke with that Fab Four image and with simpler tunes like ""Thank You Girl,"" ""She Loves You"" and  ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" to explore deeper subjects and write more complex music. Even tracks such as ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""Don't Bother Me"" and the title piece of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-HARD-DAY-S-NIGHT/dp/B0000542D2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A HARD DAY'S NIGHT</a>&nbsp;(UK-1964), their first collaboration with director Richard Lester, gave indication of where the Beatles were heading.

Songs written for HELP! inaugurate the two most amazing years in this or any other band's history. Right through 1966, recordings of sheer brilliance didn't flow from Abbey Road studios, they gushed in a torrent, but as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RUBBER-SOUL/dp/B000002UAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RUBBER SOUL</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REVOLVER/dp/B000002UAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REVOLVER</a>&nbsp;were post-HELP!, a mention is all they'll get here.

George's ""I Need You"" is a lover's lament. Three of John's tracks describe a complete cycle. ""You're Going to Lose That Girl"" expresses a fearful premonition, ""Ticket To Ride"" has his relationship actually ending and ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"" is the result: a heartbroken man who's looking to withdraw.

On a personal note, HELP! is my favorite rock-related movie. It also contains my single favorite Beatles song, performed on a boulder-lined Bahamas beach. The lyrics of Paul's ""Another Girl"" curiously begin mid-sentence. It's a superior tune on a serious subject (I'm leaving you for someone else), features an interesting key shift in the middle-eight and a great hook: Ringo's double-clutch foot pedal after lyric lines (""I don't wanna say that I've been... unhappy with you"" boomboom!).

Although Ringo doesn't have a vocal, he is central to the story. A ring firmly stuck on his right hand means that an Eastern cult will try to paint Ringo bright red and then sacrifice him on an ornate altar to a multi-armed god figure, that is if a scientist and his inept ssistant don't amputate our hero's finger first. The zany pursuit is non-stop, the ""gear"" dialogue a delight.

Granted the film's plot is silly, yet seeing the boys in color and in their absolute prime is still awesome all these years later. Knowing what came next musically is a bit of consolation to our 21st Century Beatles-less reality.. HELP! is a glimpse into the rarest time in rock history, when four working class Brits from a town on the Mersey estuary ruled the pop music universe. We'll never again know the likes of this classic movie or the brilliant lads who starred in it, but thank heavens it all happened!

I am definitely glad to have a copy for my collection (I didn't have any of the aforementioned problems with the DVD other than the sound was so good I had to turn down the TV set to keep from getting blasted out of my room).
Favorite scene, the romp in the snow with the henchmen dressed as snowmen.

718105,1,6303823351,"Sadly, one of my favourite Beatles albums (replete with strong melodic pop) contains the 'soundtrack' to an extremely disappointing cinematographic effort.

After the innocent charm of 'Hard Day's Night', hopes were high that director Richard Lester would create another classic Beatles film.

But everyone tried too hard, or perhaps, not hard enough. Lacklustre performances from the Beatles themselves (were they really interested?) and the stellar English supporting cast, a flimsy and laboured story, and an embarrassingly unfunny script leaves little to enjoy.

For a slice (albeit a contrived one) of early 1960s Beatles life, watch 'Hard Day's Night'. Everything else, until the revealing documentary 'Let It Be' (when will it be released?) that bookended their career was a regrettable waste of time and money.",1296950400,,818,5.580645161290323
718106,1,6303823351,"The UK ""Parlophone"" (PAL format) pressing of this 2 Disc ""Help!"" DVD is perfect - whereas I am one of at least 3 people (see the added comments to this review) who have found the USA ""Capitol"" label (NTSC format) pressing to be faulty. I bought the Capitol label Special Edition of ""Help!"" direct from Amazon in November 2007, but I didn't get around to watching it until January 2011 - and I was very disappointed to find the feature film disc to be completely unplayable after the first 40 minutes (even though the disc looks pristine). I tried it in several stand-alone DVD players and in my PC drive. It was far too late to request a refund, so instead I went to Amazon.uk and bought the Parlophone (PAL) pressing and it works absolutely perfectly. (NB: in Australia all DVD players play both NTSC and PAL discs, and most will play discs from all DVD regions, because there is no legal impediment to ""region free"" players).

So I must rate the USA ""Capitol"" label pressing of this DVD product as one star at best (because it is severely faulty) - even though the film itself is worth at least 4. Amazon reviews are absolutely for expressing an opinion about the quality and features of a product, as well as for expressing an opinion on the aesthetics of the product. Some great films have been released in a shoddily manufactured or poorly packaged DVD format. Two other Amazon customers report they experienced the same fault with their USA copies of ""Help!"" - there will no doubt be many others who have not complained.

718352,5,6303823351,"When it comes to Sid, the only thing that explains our heritage better then Death Ring would be the Beatles. Looking back to the start of 94 are some of the fondest memories in Sid's history. Those days of cruising in Santa's giant gold Oldsmobile singing along to some early Beatles, anything prior to Revolver at the time, were some of the greatest times that have ever taken place. Even though we have a very vast catalog of music favorites the Beatles just seem to take us back to those glory days we can't help but relive in our minds. Which brings us to our feature of the evening.

We're not going to go too far into the synopsis since most are very familiar with the film. However if you're not here it is, Ringo has a giant Ruby ring that is needed as part of an Eastern cult's sacrifice. So they discover the drummer of the Beatles has the ring and set off to England to get it back. Only problem is Ringo can't seem to remove the ring which leads to plenty of laughs thanks to a cast of very stoned Beatles. Sure the film is goofy, as one reviewing said, but that is what the Beatles humor was at the time. It was the 1965, what kind of humor were you expecting? No matter what it's a 5 star film with some great laughs and even greater music. It's the perfect blend to keep the Thursday version of Sid's focus in tact.

Naturally Help comes with a huge recommendation from us for any Beatles fan out there. Even if you didn't live during the time when the film was released, it's still a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by the right viewer. Sid happens to have an old soul and lives for this kind of stuff. Also now knowing The Beatles were stoned out of their mind's throughout the entire film just adds an extra amount of enjoyment. It hardly possible to leave the couch stoned let alone film an entire movie with music included. So we close with this memory from Ringo, ""A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film. It was great. Very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script.""",1253664000,,2087,4.2544080604534
718353,4,6303823351,"To commemorate the 40th anniversary of ""Help!"" in 2007, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had an exhibit devoted to the movie.  The exhibit contained such things as props, copies of shooting schedules, and audio of radio advertisements.  At the end of the exhibit was a small theater which ran the movie continuously.  It is there that I saw part of ""Help!"" for the first time....and I was hooked immediately.  Not too long thereafter I saw the movie in it's entirety and kept asking myself why I had not seen the movie sooner.  Other reviews have pointed out the fact that The Beatles are not the best actors in the world.  While that is true, their very strong presence on the screen (and the fact that they clearly seem to be enjoying themselves from start to finish) more than makes up for that in my opinion.  ""Help!"" is just plain fun to watch.  From the excellent music (as well as the accompanying ""videos"") to the hysterical villains, to Eleanor Bron's great performance, there is a lot to like.

I rented Help recently and I have to tell you, I couldn't even finish watching it. It's a horrible movie.

718359,3,6303823351,"It's hard to remember when director Richard Lester was viewed as an auteur and was one of the leading lights in world cinema, but there were a couple of years in the mid-1960s when that was the case. With the one-two punch of A Hard Day's Night and The Knack...And How to Get It, which actually won the Palm d'Or at Cannes, Lester's modish mix of stylish location shooting around London with slapstick antics derived from his love of silent film epitomised an entire era. His intial colour films, Help! and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum were nothing less than gorgeous pieces of pop art, utterly beguiling if ultimately trivial, with Forum (one of my all-time favourite films) applying Lester's ravishing eye to swinging ancient Rome instead of swinging London. The London we see in Help!, rows of brick townhouses and bleak urban centres, splashed with bits of colour and fashion and steeped in youth culture, were surely an enormous influence on Antonioni's Blow-Up. Of all of Lester's run of films in the mid-60s, however, Help! is the least successful, partly because Lester is taking his approach to its most extreme, largely tossing out narrative in favour of slapstick and visuals. The film is the equivalent of The Knack's improvised scenes of that film's three young protagonists running around London with the bed, but extended out to full movie length. Some of the bits in Help! are genius. When the boys are introduced, entering their row of adjoining townhouses, and we follow them inside to discover that they are all living in one enormous house, colour-coded into various ""regions"" for each of the boys, it's a deliriously funny conceit. The ensuing nonsense was the entire inspiration for the American TV series The Monkees. In the end, however, Help! lags because it just can't sustain any forward momentum. Despite frequently gorgeous images and fine music, you find your attention wandering. The boys themselves are exceedingly wooden actors, so the burden of things fall on a supporting cast of veteran British comic and Shakespearean actors. They're all game, but it's ultimately to little avail. And in the end, Help! is the only one of Lester's films I haven't wanted to see more than once.",1250640000,2,2231,4.9204244031830235

718410,4,6303823351,"As Richard Lester says, if you can remember the sixties, you weren't there. To enjoy this movie you had to have lived through the Beatles era. The story is basically crap with a few entertaining scenes. But that's not the reason to buy the DVD. (I paid $21 in Feb 2008)

What you get, is three things. First, the music is great. You can easily access that by jumping from scene-to-scene. Next, restoration is brilliant.  Although this is a standard MPEG CD in wide-screen format, the quality is almost Blu-ray at normal viewing distances. Last is disk 2.  This is the real meat. Richard Lester describes the production, a real challenge handling the frivolous, drugged out four.  Wendy Richards was screwed out of a scene because the Beatles could not act or remember their lines! You also get a technical overview of the restoration. We really owe a lot to those guys, who painstakingly worked through every frame.

But the real charm of the movie is the characterization of life in the UK at the time. In 1964, this is what life was like and it was fun, even though we were poor.",1248998400,2,1081,4.580310880829016
718411,2,6303823351,"Let me state, up front, that I have never been a huge The Beatles fan. I acknowledge them as a fine pop quartet, along the lines of The Dave Clark 5 or the musically much better The Zombies or The Yardbirds, but I have never swooned over them as the greatest rock band of all time- despite sales records, because, they were pop, not rock. Rock was The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Ten Years After, The Doors, Black Sabbath, or Deep Purple. But, even were one to accept them as the greatest pop group of all time, their film work has to be considered distinct. Prior to watching their second live action film, the color film Help!, I had seen, as a child, the psychedelic cartoon Yellow Submarine (which I recall as mildly diverting), and their first live action film, the black and white A Hard Day's Night, which, while nowhere near great cinema, was somewhat better than this film, for a) it had a real (if thin) plot, b) featured better acting by the supporting cast and even the boys, and c) actually had some real humor.

Help!, by contrast, is simply a bad film. One might argue that, a generation pre-MTV, it is a great extended musical video, with nonsensical non-musical interludes, thus it is a seminal work in that genre. If so, I will concur, but cinematically, while there are many stylistic innovations employed, from the use of color tinting to choppy and quick edits, etc., it simply has no tale to tell save this: an Indian cult obsesses over a large red ring that a female fan sends Ringo Starr as a gift. The cult travels to India to a) either get the ring, or b) sacrifice Ringo if the ring cannot be removed from his finger. That's it. Granted, a mad scientist and his assistant, as well as an Inspector and his crew from Scotland Yard, join in the chase. But, that's it. The film ends with the ring coming off Ringo's finger, the boys escaping, and the rest of the cast chasing each other.

Was Help! a film that had influence on the future musical scene? Of course, for this film is really the birth of the music video a generation before MTV (the film was made and released in 1965), and, in retrospect, it has been far more influential- both musically and in terms of the marketing of music (it's essentially one long advertisement), than its predecessor, A Hard Day's Night. But, it's simply not a good a film as their first one, which itself was only mildly entertaining, filmically. As a comedy, Help! is just not funny. Compared to films from great comedy teams, the laughs are sparse, and the skits lame blackouts, unable to sustain laughter upon rewatch- assuming one even laughs the first time the skits are seen. So, beware, if you are anything but a die-hard fan of The Beatles. Help! really needs it. Perhaps I should have stated that up front?",1248825600,2,2789,4.52079207920792
718412,5,6303823351,"I hadn't seen the Beatles' Help! movie in a long, long time, let alone the 2007 premastered version. Well, I picked this up recently, and boy, am I glad I did. The 2007 reissue is a 2 DVD set.

DVD 1 of ""Help!"" (95 min.) brings the original movie (released in 1965), and what a delight it is to see it again after all this years. It doesn't have the original charm and innocence of 1964's ""A Hard Day's Night"", but that is not a surprise as at that time the Beatles were battling the peak of Beatlemania. Director Richard Lestor somehow manages the 4 guys through a zany script (something about a chase for a ring on Ringo's finger, not that it matters a whole lot). The movie is just a pretense to showcase the Beatles in any way, shape or form. The way the songs are presented in the movie became, what is clear by now, a model on how to shoot interesting music videos (as is acknowledged in the second DVD, more on that later). The songs play fabulously if you have the proper home-theatre set-up (which I have). To think that this movie is now 44 years old just boggles the mind. It still feels fresh to this day.

DVD 2 (60 min.) brings mostly a recollection of those who were involved in the movie at that time, and it is a delight to hear these people (including the director, but also many others) recollecting on the insaneness that it was to shoot a film with the Beatles. Lester tells a funny anecdote that he received an award from MTV for being the father of music videos and he says ""I want a blood test"", haha! It also includes a look on how the movie was ""remastered"" (with spectacular results, by the way) and several trailers for the movie, including one in Spanish for ""Los Beatles"", just hilarious.

In all, this is a must have for Beatles fans, and by now also a great historical time-capsule of things in the mid-60s. Highly recommended!",1243814400,,1859,4.351585014409222

Somehow, I never saw this one until now. It's not remotely comparable to ""A Hard Day's Night."" The silly plot about an Indian death cult trying to recover one of Ringo's rings wears thin fast. Still, it's delightful to see the Fab Four in restored, glorious color. The songs are great, but are just gratuitously stuck in every 10 minutes with no relation to the plot. Worse, the Beatles don't bother to even pretend to be playing along. They are out of synch, especially Ringo who doesn't bother to stay on the beat, his cymbals flailing every which way, his drums set up in absurd locations like some rocks at the beach or a military plain. Film looks like it was just duped yesterday, though, thanks to the great restoration.

  It comes over as a very clever film with fantastic songs,the film being ahead of it's time. The one thing though the missing scene with Wendy Richard.

718613,2,6303823351,"First of all two things:

1. What is it with Amazon publishing reviews that do not belong to the item in the page? I mean, I can understand they might be similar items (DVD or VHS version) but if I am looking for the deluxe edition none of the reviews have any info about it.
2. I have been a big fan of the Beatles since I was a kid and I listened to my dad's albums and watched VHS copies of the movies with him. I just thought I'd clarify that before explaining why I gave 2 stars to this item.

When originally released I really wanted to get this edition, unfortunately the list price of over a hundred dollars was just too much for me, so I had to go and buy the regular `Help' DVD edition. Last week this was being sold at the Gold Box deal of the day for $29, needless to say I didn't think twice and got it. As the title of my review says, what really made me happy about getting this is the price I paid, as the edition does not live up to the expectations and to me, it is simply not worth the hundred dollars this costs on regular price.

The DVD

With so many reviews from the DVD edition already here I have little to add, the remastered version looks great (better than the first DVD edition released), sound is incredible (I really regret a remastered soundtrack was not released as they did with the ""Yellow submarine songtrack"") and the extras are excellent, lots of interviews and data directly from the people involved in making this classic film. Many people consider this movie to be not as good as ""A hard day's night"" but I beg to differ, the classic British humor and charisma of the fab four make this film an enjoyable experience. When I got it I had my wife watch it for her first time and she loved it, the movie and the songs are timeless.

The Deluxe Edition

The Deluxe edition even though it contains the same two discs from the regular DVD edition has a different presentation for them.

The box opens from one side (as shown in the picture of the product) and the box inside contains the book with pictures from the movie, and a copy (literally a copy) of the script of the film with hand written notations by Richard Lester.

The cover on the book has the two discs inside attached to the inside of the front cover, the little circle plastics holding it are cheaply glued and (at least with my copy) they easily detach, so it is definitely not a good place to keep the discs as if they fall they can end up stained with glue or scratched by being rubbed with one another. The book has indeed pictures from the film in a nice quality paper, some pictures from some deleted scenes but unfortunately is too short, in other words, content may not be as complete as you would expect. There is an envelope (with pictures printed in it) attached to the book that contains the folded poster of the movie, it is supposed to be a replica of the original poster so this is something collectors will want to frame. In the inside of the back cover there is another place where the 8 lobby cards are attached, these are great replicas and they have that look of old (B&W pictures hand painted to promoted the film)

The copy of the script is printed in a lesser quality paper, they are color copies so even though is white paper printed with black ink you will see hand written notes with blue/red pen from the director. It is interesting to read those as you will have a look at how it was scripted and what was changed. The way it looks in the picture is the way you get it, no hard cover but a carton one.

Bottom-line, had I paid over a hundred dollars for this I would have been very mad. Extras in the so called ""Deluxe"" edition are not deluxe for me, for what you actually get I truly believe this item is seriously overpriced and a rip-off to Beatle fans willing to pay the regular price for it. If you are getting this, you better wait until Amazon drops the price in the future. I paid $29 dollars for it and I don't think of it as a nice deal, that's what this should have cost in the first place. A better case for the DVDs and other extras may have been what this edition needed to be truly called Deluxe.

The video is clear as day, color is perfect, the extras are very nice, and the movie isn't bad either.  So throw away your tape versions of this film and get this one.

The plot is fairly simple:  Ringo is wearing a ring (which he can't seem to get off of his finger) that marks him as the next victim to be sacrificed for the sake of an obscure eastern religion.  Besides being pursued by the leader and various followers of that odd group, he is being pursued by two mad scientists who want the ring because they believe its unusual properties will allow them to rule the world.  In the telling of the story we're treated to all manner of aural and visual puns, social commentary, and extraordinary music that has lasted all these years without becoming an embarrassment to the memory.

My 4-year old loves it and dances around and around when the title song comes on, and with a couple of the other songs, and I confess I get up and dance with her.  The restoration of this 40+-year old movie is really, really good and as a Beatles fan, I sure appreciate and applaud the work that was done.",1215993600,,610,4.205128205128205
718685,5,6303823351,"Despite the frivolous, not to say silly, plot, ""Help!"" is just plain fun; and, if one gets past the frantic antics, it is full of delightful puns and allusions (some are very British). The adorable four are supported by an A-1 cast, including Leo McKern, who puts as much zest into his role as the evil Clang as he does into that of Rumpole. Victor Spinetti (who was also in ""A Hard Day's Night""), chews the scenery as the mad scientist, Foot, and he is ably assisted by Roy Kinnear as the dippy Algernon. Eleanor Bron is outstanding as the mysterious Ahme, who, decked out in an outrageous peacock blue turban and plumes informs the lads that there is more to her than meets the eye. Each one of us probably has our favorite scene; mine is one in which Ringo in the cellar is told not to worry about the Bengal tiger; all he has to do to calm the beast is sing the ""Ode to Joy"" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony; and then all the Beatles and everyone else in the pub above the cellar belt it out in German! Goofy, but so what? It's fun!

The second disk with the commentary is particularly enlightening. Not only are there the very interesting comments of the director, Richard Lester, but there is also a fascinating explanation by the technicians on the intricacies of restoring the film. Wendy Richard, who plays Miss Brahms, in ""Are You Being Served?"", talks about the thrill of playing her very first role in ""Help!,"" only to discover at the last minute that the scene had been cut (They show bits and pieces of it).

As far as the sound...they offer PCM stereo and 5.1 DTS - I wish they would have offered 5.1 surround (as they did on the 'LOVE' dvd/cd) for people like me who don't have DTS, but I consider this a minor flaw.

718760,5,6303823351,"I am probably committing heresy here but I've recently watched both A Hard Day's Night and Help! in high-def and I have to give Help! the edge, in spite of its far-fetched plot involving a magic ring. Let's face it, both of these movies have their plot defects, but Help! comes through somehow fresher.(I would have felt differently 30 years ago).

One thing that I found evident was just how much the television show, The Monkees, that I grew up with was a blatant (but well-done) rip-off of Help! When I was a kid, growing up in the 70's, the Beatles were yesterday's news, but the Monkees' show was on every afternoon, and as Michael Stipe has often said, was perhaps a bigger influence on that generation than the disbanded Beatles, whom I would discover through listening to Wings, about the time that Wings began to falter.

Anyway, watching Help! is a bit like watching an extended Monkees episode(Yes, they all had ridiculous plots just like Help!) and for the MTV generation who came prior to The Real World, this will feel comforting because Help! is basically full of music videos.

The newly-released print looks sensational. I am not sure if I have ever seen a color movie from that era that looks as good as the new Help! DVD and the movie seems a lot better than it did the first time that I saw it back in the mid to late 1970's. The boys look great and were at the height of their musical prowess and their beauty as men. They would never again look this great together and appear to be such great friends, just having a sensational time as mates.

This movie is extremely silly and hilarious, while still keeping the plot, and surprisingly, keeps the story-line moving, all the way to the end.

This movie made me laugh all the way through, while at the same time, I got to enjoy the songs that were on the ""Help!"" CD. The attempts to get Ringo's ring made me laugh the most during the film.

""Help!"" is a great movie for anybody who is a beatles fan, old-time movie fan, or just want a good laugh. I'd highly recommend this movie, and plan to watch it again very soon.",1211932800,,853,4.279503105590062

718766,3,6303823351,"In spite of being in the right place at the right time, Richard Lester never was (and still isn't, I suppose) all that great of a director.  He has ruined many a possibly good film with cornball theatrics.

While it is extremely important culturally (and a far superior film than HELP!), I'm not much of an avid fan of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, either (the Beatles movies don't really get good until MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR - yes, that one is flawed too, but it's still a fascinating, psychedelic home movie).  When Lester just allows the Beatles to be the Beatles in both films, they are pretty sublime.  When he actually makes them do stuff, they come off as really stilted.  The best moment in HELP! comes early, when the Beatles are just hanging out in their one-room/four-bed flat, or later when they are hanging out in Buckingham Palace, somewhat sordidly talking about chopping Ringo's finger off.

In contrast with these fleeting moments, the cheap parody of James Bond action and iconography that comprises the rest of the film is joylessly uninspired.  To see the Beatles at the mercy of a half-baked romp just feels like a massively wasted opportunity.  The great cast (especially Eleanor Bron) is similarly stranded with little to do.  The Monkees did a much better job with this kind of mediocre material.

After having seen the film on this recently restored dvd (and the film does look great, especially all the musical numbers, which make viewing/owning the dvd worthwhile), I was struck by the near-paranoid anti-Indian xenophobia of the film.  This is only months before George Harrison began embracing Indian music and philosophy; of the four bandmates, I imagine he hated this film most of all.",1209427200,,1705,4.865051903114187

I already had my copy of the first movie on DVD and when this one was finally offered at a reasonable price, I snatched it up!
The story itself is full of silliness and fun, as any fan of the Beatles knows...these four guys knew how to ""act it out"" in front of a camera, even for an older person like myself, who is now 57 years old.
Nothing like the gory, slasher movies of today, this one was just what a movie-goer looks for ~ lighthearted entertainment, nothing too heavy or melodramatic, and a few good tunes thrown into the mix, just for fun! :)

Personally, I liked this movie better than 'A Hard Day's Night'. Don't ask me why. Don't believe I've watched this film since I was a kid. Movie centers around some weirdo religious cult and their 'great Swami' leader attempting at ALL costs to snatch a sacrificial ring from Ringo. They try by hiding in a mailbox, a sandwich machine, etc. Several semi-side splitting scenes through the picture. Songs that were bringing back some precious memories were ""You're Going To Lose That Girl"", ""Ticket To Ride"", ""The Night Before"" (one of my personal favorites), ""I Need You"" and ""She's A Woman"". Heard from a friend of mine and I totally agree that one cool factor about this movie was the way the Fab Four's house appeared to be of average size on the outside but when you step inside, the place is huge. Sort of cartoon-like. Liked the way John (was it?) had his bed in a lowered portion of the guy's pad. A forty year-plus film that hasn't lost much at all through the years.

While the story is a little weak, the music and laughs are great. It was still a time when the lads were still enjoying the fame. John's humor, that we saw in 'HDN', is still present.

The songs are great and have developed from the songs in the first film.

In many ways, it's almost painfully innocent invoking a time when comedy didn't have to make sense or rely on fart jokes as punch lines.  To me, Help! invokes the spirit of my favorite Marx Brothers film, Duck Soup.  The four Beatles, while not as distinctive here as the four Marxes, seem to be having a grand time running around in a crazy not-quite-real world that isn't too far removed from Duck Soup's Freedonia.  The film's logic operates on its own level and that works just fine.

The humor--to use a modern term--is ""politically incorrect,"" basing the chase for the ring on a quasi Hindu and/or Muslim beliefs as filtered through Western screenwriters and their bag of cliches.  It's dated, but its still funny if you can get past the stereotypes.

The film itself plays around with the form, using titles, self-reflexive joking around, and all in all silliness.  The thin plot is like the best of the Marx Brothers, nothing more than a place to hang the jokes and schtick on.  On that level Help! really is a lot of fun, plus all that great Beatles music.

718962,5,6303823351,"1965, It was the Beatles and James Bond, both competing for the pop culture dollar. Just as in 1956 you had Elvis and Davey Crockett, squaring off for the entertainment dollar. In '65 Goldfinger and 007 were all the rage and The Beatles who were invincible up until then were facing off against The upstart Rolling Stones, The California cool Beach Boys and Motown wonders The Supremes. So how did the Liverpool Lads counter?...Brilliantly of course.

First you take a half-baked sort of spy-like, espionge story-line. You incorporate some silly slap stick routines and you round it out with an outstanding selection of orginal songs...and....Walla!!!!! What have you got?...Why a pop cultue phenomenon that has outlasted the Hoola Hoop, The Nehru Suit, The Love In and I dare say even Davey Crockett himself.

But if it were only that easy.... Then again, it all seems so easy in the capable hands of the The Fab Four. Afterall, true talent will always prevail. And so we have HELP. I don't think you need any further analysis to conclude that HELP truly was and always will be a pop culture milestone. Surfice to say... ""When I was young I never needed anyone""...Anyone that is except The Beatles. Forty plus years later, that still hasn't changed, Yes I can live in a world without James Bond, Davey Crockett, The Rolling Stones and the like.

718966,5,6303823351,"After the overnight success of ""A Hard Day's Night"", there was just no stopping the ""runaway train"" known as the Beatles. But instead of giving us AHDN knockoff, director Richard Lester & the boys aimed for something different: A footloose adventure delving into ""Alice In Wonderland"" surrealism, wrapped around a James Bond-like spoof. And in COLOR, no doubt!
Ringo--the ""quiet"" Beatle--is the centerpiece of this film, having the misfortune of wearing a sacred & valuable ring sought after by a religious cult, mad scientists & other assorted characters. But this movie is more significant than people realize, for it preceded the zany antics of Monty Python by a few years (witness the off-the-wall ""intermission"" plot break that could've been easily used by Python!). For four musicians, the Beatles solidify their status as ""the English cousins of the Marx Brothers"", living in a zany, surrealistic apartment, shrinking Paul down to gum-wrapper size (you have to see it to believe it) and poking fun at all the so-called ""danger"" around them.
And of course, there are the musical interludes in the film, hinting at what would come with the music video revolution.  The film's carefree exuberance is another example of why John, Paul, George & Ringo are so-much loved all over the planet.
The DVD restoration of this film is simply remarkable; it looks as if it was just filmed yesterday. ""Help"" is going to be a real keeper for generations to come!",1199318400,,1453,5.029045643153527

On the other hand, I not only grew up following The Beatles as they released their albums, eagerly anticipating each release, but I am also a fan of film in general.  I love reading film scripts.  I also like looking at memorabilia.  This set contains a whole lot of stuff that greatly appeals to me in addition to the film itself.

For one, there is a beautiful reproduction of an original large advertising poster for the film.  This is no cheap quality repro, either.  Secondly, there is a series of original lobby card reproductions - these would be small posters done on cardboard stock to advertise films within the theater lobby.  I think there are a half-dozen here.  If you add up the cost of a quality poster reproduction plus the cost of high quality lobby cards, the cost of this deluxe edition doesn't seem so stratospheric.

Well reproduced in DTS 5.1, the title track, Ticket to Ride, I Need You, Another Girl, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, and The Night Before never sounded so great! Musically and cinematically, the video sequences of the songs are classic Beatles and make up the appealing portions of this motion picture.

As for the rest, the plot had potential, but bad acting and poor dialogue, both of which were apparently due to lack of effective directing and production, marred what could have been something substantially more than just a campy masterpiece. The way that the perpetual fight and chase scenes were laid out indicated to me that there were those in charge who were looking for a cheap product that they could use to bank off of Beatlemania.

To make a longwinded criticism short, think of the worst Avengers episodes you have ever seen, especially the post-Diana Rigg ones. By comparison, this movie is arguably more inane. And I believe that had the Beatles been a much less talented quartet, their careers and legacies, both on screen and on stage, might not have endured. Forgive me if these words are harsh, but I tried to find the slightest merits other than the musical numbers and kept coming up short. Oh, the tyranny of unreason!

Help! is the perfect icon of a short but wonderful era in history. The Beatle's slice of history. The film itself isn't exactly the stuff Academy Award winners are made of, with the possible exception of the music. After all, that's what it really was a showcase for.

719160,1,6303823351,"One of the first rules you learn in art school is, `You always cut the frame to fit the art, you never cut the art to fit the frame'.  This is out of respect to the artistic vision and the recognition of the frame as merely a subservient presentation tool.
  FULL-SCREEN was developed for kids who cannot tolerate any unused part of the old FULLSCREEN CRT TVs. Some people just don't get it.  I actually know someone who has a 65 inch SONY LCD WIDESCREEN TV but there is no way I can convince him that a FULLSCREEN DVD is actually a misnomer since FULLSCREEN format takes a WIDESCREEN image and crops off the right and left sides of the movie to square it off to fit on a standard TV.  He only buys FULLSCREEN versions of movies and then converts them to WIDESCREEN by distorting the image by stretching and cropping the top and bottom of the already cropped image to fill his widescreen TV screen!  It should be obvious to everyone that this bastardization of image is a plague of the mind to be avoided whenever possible.  Converting FULLSCREEN to WIDESCREEN is something only kids do who not only believe that bigger is always better, but also believe that includes any illusion of being larger.  Since the faces in a FULLSCREEN image look bigger on a WIDESCREEN TV, then the picture on a FULL SCREEN DVD must be bigger.  At no time can a person who thinks this way tolerate any unused part of their TV screen because unless every square inch of it is lit, they feel cheated somehow.  In order to get the entire ORIGINAL image of HELP on a WIDESCREEN TV, there must be unused space on the sides, but WIDESCREEN MANIA won't allow it.  Such is the ill logic that prevailed by the manufacturers of this DVD.
  In 1965 this movie, HELP! was originally filmed in British Standard of 1.6:1 or one and two thirds to one (wider than Full Screen) but the film was cropped on the top and bottom to create a FAKE WIDESCREEN effect for the American theatrical release in the USA WIDESCREEN standard of 1.75:1 or one and three-fourths to one.  When HELP was released in the US on TV it restored the top and bottom of the movie that was cropped for the US WIDESCREEN but the original 1.6 image was then cropped on the sides by using the pan and scan technique to fit on the TV FULL SCREEN of 1.3:1 or one and a third to one, and this pan-and-scan version has been previously released by Apple in their Beatles DVD Collector's Set if you want to compare images.
 For this DVD release, the movie was converted from the 1.75:1 (one and three-fourths to one) USA FAKE WIDESCREEN version to a WIDER SCREEN format of 16:9, as is stated on the box.  The top and bottom of the already cropped  movie image has been cropped again for this purpose, which is nothing less than a CRIME against art!!  This MORE FAKE WIDESCREEN version often decapitates any of the actors at the top of the frame, as well as one of the opening credits.  Why do we have to tolerate this? Please don't support this inanity foisted upon us by corporate idiots.",1197158400,42,3016,4.411552346570397

719243,5,6303823351,"The Beatles' second film is wonderfully restored to its original high saturation full color glory in this two DVD set. It looks beautiful and sounds great. The film itself is widely underrated. If the band's amazing film debut, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" had not been so unexpectedly brilliant, ""Help!"" would stand today as one of the classic British comedy films of the 1960s. This is not to say that ""Help!"" is a better film, but by comparision, this one has more outrageous site gags, more rapid-fire British wit, much more plot, more funny characters, more locations and more interesting sets. Like ""A Hard Day's Night,"" it was directed by Richard Lester, who excelled in spectacular comedies. (He later directed ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and the best and funniest versions of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers."") The soundtrack offers seven now-classic Beatles songs and a classical score the effectively offsets the pleasant pop of the Fab Four. The plot centers around the pursuit of a mystical ring stuck on Ringo's hand, giving two sets of comical bad guys an excuse to chase the band through England, the Swiss Alps and the Bahamas. Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear, Eleanor Braun, Leo McKern, John Buthal and Patrick Cargil all turn in wonderfully over-the-top comic performances and the Beatles themselves are very funny, too. Extras on this collection include behinds the scenes footage in the context of several short documentaries, backckground on the restoration of the film and a decontruction of a lost scene that was cut from the film. Beatles buffs will be interested in noting the cameos by longtime Beatles aid Mal Evans as the swimmer looking for the White Cliffs of Dover.",1197072000,3,1724,4.989583333333333
719244,4,6303823351,"The film transfer is pristine, there is no beef there.  The audio on the songs which is supposed to be 5.1 is a fake 5.1 where the rear channels are used as a delay.  Let me explain...According to The Beatles Recording Sessions by Mark Lewisohn virtually all of the generations of the earlier recordings (Help were some of the first four track) were saved.  These could have been linked up in ProTools to create a new multi track master and a much better 5.1 could have been achieved than the one where the rear channels were just delay.  Giles Martin remixed things for ""Love""...why not do it for the movies...it just makes sense.  The recent Genesis remixes in 5.1 are great examples of the way 5.1 COULD be used.  I would like to see much more of that in the marketplace.  That is my ""tech"" take on the situation.  I am so glad they restored the video however.  My old VHS was getting very tired.  So I shall just have to settle for fake 5.1.  Obviously one cannot do anything with a mono movie soundtrack except delays to create a fake 5.1.",1196985600,,1044,4.385416666666667

It's been well worth the wait.  The film is just as fun, cute, and entertaining as I remember it.  Though I know that AHDN is technically supposed to be the superior film, I've always preferred 'Help!' for some reason, perhaps because it has more of a plot.  The plot, Ringo getting a large sacrificial ring stuck on his finger and then having to evade the people trying to capture him for their religious ritual, is admittedly paper-thin and rather ridiculous, but not in a bad way.  The adventures he and his mates go through in their quest to outrun the bad guys and save his hide are full of charm, fun, wit, absurb humor, British humor, and spoofing of the James Bond genre.  They also showcase some great settings, among them the Alps and the Bahamas.  The songs performed are among the very early music videos, easily as innovative as anything from the era of the music video as a deliberate artform.  They really do seem to be the precursors to the music video, since they're more than just the band singing their songs.  My favorite songs on the soundtrack are probably ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and ""I Need You.""  It also doesn't hurt that The Beatles look so great in color, and still so young, fresh-faced, and gorgeous.  It's hard to decide which one is my favorite in this film, since they're all so charming, funny, and cute!  They also faithfully showcase the personalities they'd been tagged with, but in a natural way; there's not any sense that they're merely spoofing labels like ""the cute one,"" ""the sarcastic witty one,"" ""the quiet serious one,"" and ""the dopey but loveable one.""  And their four unique personalities really help to make this film so infectiously fun, the type of thing the whole family can watch, instead of just young kids or older people who want a trip down memory lane.

The extras included on the basic edition are pretty good, a lot better than the disappointing bonus material on the current DVD of AHDN.  There are trailers, a featurette on the restoration of the film (proving that film restoration isn't just needed for films from the distant past), a making-of mini-documentary, the description of a missing scene (contrary to how it's described as the actual missing scene itself), a featurette of the cast and crew reminiscing about the film, a couple of radio spots hidden on the menu, and a booklet with great pictures and information about the making of the film.  I do wish there had been even more bonus features, but I'm more than happy with the basic edition over the ridiculously overpriced deluxe edition.  I also wish the discs had been put in separately; I hate when two-disc sets arrange them so that they're overlapping one another.  This can make it easier to scratch or damage a disc when you're removing it.  This film truly has never looked or sounded better, and while it's not really the stuff of great classic film, it is a really fun film.  Not everything is intended as great cinema; sometimes you just want to be entertained by something lightweight like this.  Getting reacquainted with the film after so many years away really made me kind of feel like a teenager again.",1196553600,4,3376,4.640336134453782

Coffee table size slipcase (not the DVD size we all know), the entire HELP! script, full-color poster, theatre mini-posters, great full-color 60-page book with great photos, bonus DVD and great sound. For any Beatle fan this is a rockn' holiday gift!  After all folks, this is the greatest rock band in history. Period (based on record sales).

Again, some of the best packaging I have seen in a long time, and the best of any Beatle product. So, worth the price? Absolutely!",1195689600,8,768,4.7518796992481205
719292,5,6303823351,"Nothing to say here, but what's alredy stated. I'm just extremely grateful to be enjoying this movie the way it was always mean't to be enjoyed. Richard Lester is the most under-rated director of all time.",1195603200,2,205,4.722222222222222
719385,5,6303823351,"Reading the liner notes to ""Help!"" I didn't think I could add anything to the debate because director Richard Lester and Martin Scorsese capture the essence of the film so succinctly.  My comments may be reiterating the obvious but so be it.  I haven't seen ""Help!"" for a good twenty years or so and I was taken aback about how much better it was then I remembered it.  Aside from the Marx Brothers style hayhem I was struck by how sly the humor in the film was.  Alot of it is specific to the time and place it was made in a.k.a. mid-sixties Britain and wondered if a relative neophyte would get a lot of the inside jokes.  I was also in awe of the musical segments that in my mind, moreso than ""A Hard Day's Night"", precursed the images we would later see on MTV.  The songs are naturally great, a progression from their previous album, ""Beatles for Sale"" and anticipated ""Rubber Soul"" which was released later in the year.  I also admire the fact that the Beatles were generous in deferring  screen time to some of Britain's finer character actors, Leo McKern, Eleanor Bron, Victor Spinetti, and Roy Kinnear among others.  What make's this achievement even more amazing is consider that it was made during a period of whirlwind recording and touring for the Beatles.  Also consider that Lester directed ""A Hard Day's Night"" the previous year and directed ""Help!"" and ""The Knack...and How to Get It"" in 1965.  This enterprise doesn't have a hint of cynicism and is indicative of how the Beatles always delivered a heartfelt effort to their fans and public alike.",1195344000,2,1564,4.610108303249097
719386,1,6303823351,"Let's just say that some works don't hold up well over time.  This was little more than a poorly written 96 minute music video.  On a deeper level it is said to have reflected the growing despair that the Beatles felt as their career(s) took over their lives.  In any event, it comes across as forced, a hastily written script that gave the Beatles another go at the silver screen.  A Hard Day's Night was much better; it rocks while this one reeks.",1195257600,7,449,4.373493975903615

The restoration of the movie itself seems to be top notch (watch the behind the scenes of how they did some of the restoration of the film master, lots of painstaking work behind it!!). I am not giving it the 5 stars it so rightfully deserves because of the audio soundtrack, particularly when the Beatles break into song. This remastered Help! comes only in either 5.1 DTS (Digital Theater Sound), or 2-channel PCM stereo. Most home theater systems have Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS 5.1, which doesn't make sense why this movie wasn't remastered in Dolby 5.1. The music is loud when the Beatles break into song, and I find myself turning down the sound for the songs, then turning up the audio again to hear the regular dialog from the movie. I used to have the MPI release of Help!, and while the picture wasn't quite the same as this version, at least the musical soundtrack was in Dolby 5.1, and wasn't hard on the ears between songs and movie dialog. I did like watching the second disc of interviews, restoration of the movie, etc. (great to see what Eleanor Bron looks like today versus 1965).

But there is a major problem with this product.  I think the transfer is remarkable on a visual level.  The sound has problems.  I wonder if the music sound producer for this release is the same person who didgitally remastered the LP'S back in the 90's or early 2000's.  There seeems to be a lack of bass and an over abundance of high end sound.  Did the music sound get remastered at a different studio from the movie dialog sound?  When Dialog is being spoken the sound is very good, when the songs start the frequencies are very different, making the sound out of balance with the spoken dialog.  And almost painful to listen.

I recommend purchasing the original DVD release just for the quality sound.  But if you really need explosive color, picture and sound get this one.  But remember to release the pressure in your ears before you start to carry on a conversation with people who have not watched the movie with you. They will thank you for not talking louder than needed.",1195084800,9,1141,4.594059405940594

Firstly, the original aspect ratio must have been FS because this 16:9 version often decapitates the band member at the top of the frame, as well as one of the opening credits. I guess ""restored"" means different things to different people. Secondly, the DTS sound is absolutely incredible. The music has never sounded this good. I'd repurchase the Beatles' catalog in DTS if it were available. As silly and juvenile as the movie is, the music makes it a worthwhile purchase.",1194825600,,550,4.739583333333333

I'm also a book collector so something like this is great for me. I'm willing to spend this type of money for a handsome slipcase containing the script book that mimics the real deal, and a photograph book which contains the dvd's, poster, and postcards. It's really a beautiful production, and as mentioned it's large at 8.5"" x 11"", and weighs a lot. This is something to read once, view once and put away on your book shelf to keep in mint condition. It's too nice for repeated viewing. In fact I'll probably buy the 2DVD set and keep this one horded away.

Buy this if you want a collector's set of Beatles memorabilia, you'll be happy you did as they really give you a lot for your money. But if you just want the movie then pass it by, as this is not for you. It's strictly for collector's and they did deliver a quality product for collectors, in my opinion.

719448,4,6303823351,"1965's ""Help"", 42 years on, has a refreshing air of innocent fun about it, along with some excellent music and a silly plot involving the Beatles with a mystical but murderous Eastern Cult.

It hardly seems possible that John, Paul, George, and Ringo were ever this young; ""Help"" captures them as their collective fame had just begun to take hold, but before it devoured them altogether.  The storyline involves a huge ring that Ringo has been given by a young girl.  Unfortunately, the ring is a key prop in an Eastern Cult that periodically sacrifices people.  The Cult, led by Leo McKern in a perfectly hilarious role, is mad to get the ring back and pursues our four young heroes from London to Salisbury Plain to Switzerland to a finale in the Bahamas.  The Cult's exotic plots to get the ring back generate a nice mixture of suspense and madcap chaos, framing a series of pre-MTV music videos featuring such hits as ""Help"", ""You're Going To Lose That Girl"" and ""Ticket To Ride.""

Along the way, there are lots of sight gags and lots more banter among the Beatles themselves.  The humor may be slightly dated and very British, but holds up well.

This movie is a priceless bit of collective memory for the baby boomers who remember the Beatles phenomenon as a current event.",1194566400,,1279,4.653333333333333
719449,5,6303823351,"When I was a kid in the early '70s, my local Baltimore TV station use to run something called, ""The Million Dollar Movie"". It featured loads of old movies featuring the likes of Abbott & Costello, Tarzan, Blondie (not the band) and King Kong. But every once in awhile in their rotation would pop up the 1965 Beatles movie, ""Help!"". Being about eight or so, I was instantly sucked in by this film's antic comedy style, crazy characters, exotic locations and instantly hummable songs. But most of all I was totally turned on by the Beatles and their charismatic screen presence. It was the begining of my 'long and winding road' of becoming a full fledge, Beatle-maniac.

For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the plotline is pretty simple. A crazy, Far East religious cult is about to make a human sacrifice. But wait! They can't make the sacrifice because the 'official sacrificial ring' (to be worn by the victim) is missing! Well of course the ring turns up on the jewlery bedecked finger of a certain Beatles drummer named Ringo Starr. The cult makes multiple comic attempts to steal the ring off his finger. When that fails, they spend the rest of the film chasing the Fab Four across the world (actually England, Austria and the Bahammas), while trying to douse poor Ringo in red paint and make him the next sacrificial offering!

Is the plot ridiculous? Absurb? Even stupid? Sure! But who cares, because it is so outrageously funny! Its' basically a cross between a 'Road Runner/Looney Tune' and an old Marx Brothers movie. Like Groucho and his brothers, the plot is just a contrivance for John, Paul, George and Ringo to take on and mockingly make fun of society's staunch institutions. Through the sheer force of their free-spirited personalities and some really hilarious dialogue, they take a poke at religion, science, the govenment, police and military. Oh and lets not forget that between (and even during) the laughs, the boys are performing a few little musical ditties including ""Help!"", You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"", ""Ticket to Ride"", ""The Night Before"", ""I Need you"" and ""Another Girl"".

The movie ""Help!"" was out of print, for what seems like forever. Now it has finally been released to the DVD format and it looks wonderful. The picture is crystal clear and the color just POPS! This is great for any Beatles fan, who is use to seeing just grainy black & white footage or decades, faded color. My hat is off to the restoration team (featured in the extras) that put this all together! Furthemore the soundtrack is just beautiful. After years of listening to the muddy soundtrack album it is a revelation to hear crystal clear versions of the Beatles music. Every guitar note, every bass thump, every cymbal crash is just pure joy!

So here I am a couple of decades after I first saw ""Help!"" on local TV. I'm now a middle aged Dad, watching this DVD with my 6 year son, who's a Beatle-maniac in training (he got hooked on the Fab Four, after watching ""Yellow Submarine""). We watched, giggled, laughed our butts off and sang along to the music. Hey, it can't get much better than that...",1194566400,7,3111,4.713235294117647

All of cinematographer David Watkin's visuals are back with pristine glory.  And there isn't a single speck on this digital transfer.  This has been well worth waiting for all these years, using today's technology.

The sound might just be a point of contention to anyone who can't access DTS surround, but there is a PCM track as well.  The DTS sound is just magnificent to my ears.  If you have the system, you know how you are. The image fills my 46"" 16 by 9 screen and looks fantastic. There is a second disc of supplemental material, which is just icing on the cake.  And even the incidental music has been remixed into DTS surround stereo!  That makes things much more seamless than the recent release of ""A Hard Day's Night"".  It all feels like modern sound.

Maybe the limited edition is out of reach for some people, but the regular package of Help! includes the very same restored, remixed version of this film. It is a must have.

719509,5,6303823351,"First of all, This is a review of the $20 version of this DVD (not the $100 version), and is a review of the actually DVD, and not the actually movie.
 I purchased this DVD on a whim, as I was observing the New Releases.  I popped it in my DVD player and BANG!!.  I had to quickly turn down the volume.  The Audio is high powered, which I love.  Some older movies have lousy audio volume, even after remastering.  Not this one.  You barely need to turn up the volume on your surround sound system. The Audio is extremely sensitive to the volume dial, if you know what I mean.
 Secondly, I was extremely worried about this movie being a FULL SCREEN movie, which I hate!!  I own a 42 inch, 16x9 Widescreen Television.  And full screen movies have annoying black bars on the left and right side of the screen, and the picture looks thinned out.  This is NOT the case for this DVD.  There are extremely THIN black bars on the left and right sides of the screen, but is not really visible.  So I would call this a Widescreen version (the DVD itself says: 16.9 aspect ratio.  It is posted differently on amazon).  I was extremely happy that the bars were hardly visible, and the picture image is NOT thinned out.
 Last, I want to comment on the songs.  The songs sound much better than the LP versions, in my opinion.  I hear more of a ""live"" sound, rather than a studio sound.  The vocals, drums, and guitars just sound too perfect.
 If you are hesitant on buying this DVD because of the technical aspects of this DVD, DONT BE.  They are tremendously great.  I had my doubts when purchasing the one, but after I saw/heard it for myself, I was pleasantly surprised.  This has got to be one of the BEST remastering jobs in DVD history.

The other letdown was the ""missing scene.""  They only talk about it, show several stills and interview the leading lady of that scene (who didn't know she was cut from the film until she went to the premiere).

Lester did what was later done for TV with the MONKEES. MTV called Lester ""The Father of MTV"" due to the movie HELP...which he replied that he wanted a blood test

The film looked like nonsense, but it has a thin plot about Ringo and a special ring. Leo (Rumpole of the Bailey, The Prisoner) McKern and Roy (Three Musketeers) Kinear ham it for the camera in this romp. This is a simple enjoyable film is one of these that  family can watch

The two disk set also has a 16 page booklet with mostly pictures and very little text (if you are a film buff, I suggest you buy the deluxe HELP set with Richard Lester's annotated script book) . The booklet reminds me of a movie book, that was sold in the theaters when a large film was release..I have a few from Ben Hur and the Ten Commandments...BOY I AM DATING MYSELF NOW!

What is missing for me is Lester or the remaining Beatles (Paul & Ringo) doing an audio commentary over the film. The second disk has a few documentaries, but no comments from neither Paul nor Ringo..and that is a shame!

Now, what you all want to know is, IS IT WORTH IT?  YES, it is a still a grand piece of comedy and music that is timeless

So you don't need HELP to get this film..Just order it and get the HELP you need!

Pure visual magesty, feels like you're in the room with them.  Audio is superp, I have 16 year old Bose 901s. How sharp?  I thought John was playing a 12 string acoustic during the opening ""Help! scene"".  The ""Ticket To Ride"" sequence, (my all time favorite Beatle song) is the reason director Dick Lester was proclaimed ""The Father OF MTV"".  Fun extras too, watch Paul forge a ""George Harrsion"" autograph on a poor little girl's leg cast, Ha!  And Neil Aspinall finally takes his hat off!

719567,5,6303823351,"The issue of aspect ratios will always be a problem with films produced between 1955 & 1990.  Unless they were produced in a real ""widescreen"" format such as Cinemascope, VistaVision, or other trademarked names, the movie is best seen in full frame 1:33-1 format.

The Beatles Films A HARD DAY'S NIGHT & HELP were shot in a British theatrical format which is inbetween 1:33-1 and 1:85-1.  About 1:66-1, which means both U.S. screen formats will cut something off of the picture.

I compared the old ""Full Frame"" 1:33-1 release of HELP to this new ""Anamorphic"" 1:85-1 release.  I must first say that all of the long shots benefit from the added picture to the sides on the widescreen version, and they feel better this way.  However the widescreen version tends to cut off the tops of peoples heads in the close-ups and the full frame version looks better.

Overall the film looks superior in this newly re-mastered widescreen DVD, with the color correction & scratch removal.  The sound has been improved also (even though Laserdiscs have better sound reproduction).

The old Criterion 2-disc Laserdisc does contain some bonus material that is not on this 2-disc DVD release.  But there is also much new bonus material on this release that was not on the old 2-disc Laserdisc release.
I will keep both versions. Hopefully someday someone will release the film in it's original 1:66-1 aspect ratio and give us the full picture!",1194307200,25,1426,4.8796680497925315

Ringo's drums are sharp in ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"" and Lennon's acoustic guitar has real presence in ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.""  I liked the electricity of Harrison's Rickenbacker in ""Ticket To Ride"" and the heartfelt bass of Mccartney in ""Another Girl.""  I have never heard the Beatles like this and if you have a high end home theater system, you can shut your eyes and swear they're in the room with you.  After all, the music is what matters and the incredible remix of the seven original songs is stunning.

The original idea behind ""Help"" was to take a look at the real life of the Fab Four.  But the sex and drugs made it unlikely so a ridiculous plot was formulated as an excuse to travel to the Austrian Alps and the Bahamas.

The intervening years will melt away as you sample this delightfully poignant celebration that reminds us we are indeed mortal and as the years pass some of us have already faded away.  But with a little help, and a little love from our friends, the melody lingers forever and maybe that's more than enough.  All we have is this moment.  It's all we'll ever have.

719571,5,6303823351,"OK, I'm sure there will be 100's of reviews of the film itself, so I'll just skip to the tech review of the disc:

Video:

Full marks to the restoration team; as this is the best you're ever going to see this colourful 1965 classic.  Nearly every scratch and dirt speck is gone and the colours look fantastic on DVD.

Sound:

A full 5.1 DTS remix (not much help if you still only have Dolby Digital). Very similar to the Anthology/Love mixes of their mid 60's stuff; not many flashy rear effects (just a bit of reverb to fill it out) but for the modernists - the drums are in the centre and the new mix is a beefy one.

Extras:

A Missing Scene: Just to save you the same disappointment I had - THIS SCENE IS STILL MISSING! However, we do get Wendy Richard, Richard Lester and other insiders; giving an in-depth rundown on the lost SAM AHAB scene.

The Beatles in Help!: A great documentary featuring period interviews of the Beatles with lots of behind the scenes footage interlaced with some snippets of outtakes and 8mm home movies. Very informative. Richard Lester details some of the problems of filming in the mists of Beatlemania (there's even footage of mass crowds in the Swiss Alps!). Neil Aspinell also appears; confirming the well worn stories the Beatles recreational drug use on set.

The Restoration of Help! - An in-depth look at the restoration process.

Memories of Help! - More focused on the crews experiences making the film than the 30-minute documentary. Contains behind the scenes and home movie footage.

719573,3,6303823351,"When ""Help!"" made its home-video debut in 1987, several critics overrated the film after its long absence from television and revival houses. Nostalgic memories can be deceiving. Despite the influential visual style, this 1965 Beatles romp lacks the charm and spontaneity of ""A Hard Day's Night."" The paper-thin plot (a religious cult pursues Ringo for wearing a red-jeweled sacrificial ring) is no better than the typical Elvis musical. Strangely enough, director Richard Lester does not allow John, Paul, George and Ringo to dominate the proceedings. Instead, they share screen time with a fine array of British character actors (Leo McKern, Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill). Lester's cinematic freneticism eventually grows tiresome without a decent storyline. Nevertheless, the Fab Four's memorable numbers   ""You're Going to Lose That Girl,"" ""I Need You,"" ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and ""Ticket to Ride""   remain historic music-video prototypes. Special praise should be given to David Watkin's Eastmancolor cinematography. Compared to the overall brilliance of ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the big-budget ""Help!"" survives as an erratic farce punctuated by magical Beatle moments.",1193529600,8,1203,5.666666666666667
719574,5,6303823351,"After ""A Hard Day's Night,"" They did it in less than a year. Another comedy directed by Richard Lester. This time it's more than a musical but a very british sit-com full of Beatle gags. They were extremely funny and full of wit, they played themselved being in an adventure/ action movie and it worked perfectly. They were stoned all the time too, but that doesn't mean they weren't having fun. Ringo claims he doesn't remember a second of the shooting because he was on pot all the time. Nevertheless, he played extremely well for ""Ticket To Ride"" and ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl."" John was in his ""Fat Elvis"" phase, depressed of all the fame and fortune he had and not being able to express himself completely. Sgt. Pepper was a year and a half away. Paul McCartney had his best Beatle moment, in my opinion. Two extremely good songs: ""The Night Before"" and ""Another Girl"" were featured in the movie and another song for the Help! LP, ""Yesterday"" became his masterpiece. George wrote and sang ""I Need You"" and, with ""Something"", it's his best piece of work.

You know what would have been a great bonus feature for the DVD? a commentary/ review of the 7 additional songs in the Help! U.K. album. I would have loved to hear George Martin talking about ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy,"" the last cover the Beatles played in record, featuring a powerful, soulful John. Even tho he claimed later ""It's Only Love"" sucked, this tune is really, really adorable and romantic. Ringo strikes with ""Act Naturally"" and of course, Paul brings down the country house with ""I've Just Seen A Face."" Let's be honest, side B is better than side A in the Help! LP. Am I right?

I don't know why Help! was moved to the Nov. 6, maybe it's a Paul McCartney move to promote his DVD box being released the next week and also clean his image because of his messy divorce... I don't know. I want to have Help! right now in my hands!",1193270400,14,1896,4.492753623188406

I don't know who makes money from this stuff, but I really question whether it could really be considered ethical.

I urge all true Beatles fans to buy the records, CD's and movies as they were originally produced (I have a monophonic vinyl edition of Help in my collection), but boycott this re-release/re-hash stuff.

Would you pay that or moan its not worth it? C'mon people, the company has to make some profit here. Do you know how many people have to get their cut BEFORE The Beatles themselves get paid? Geez, you'd think it was $400. It's $95. I think that's pretty reasonable considering only 25,000 copies of this are being made, it has a deluxe hardcover slipcase, photo book, poster, lobby cards, script etc. What do you want it priced - at $30? Companies are in business to make money, not go poor because you're too cheap to pay a fair price.

I do have to agree with one comment - I do wish Paul and/or Ringo could have done commentary on this. It would have made it much more of a personal experience. We all know how we feel watching it, I just wonder what they would feel watching it themselves. When they don't bother to do commentary or have any direct connection to projects like this, it just looks like they let Apple & EMI grind out anything in their name as long as they get their royalty checks. The recent debacle with the EMI/Capitol CD reissues is a prime example. It's like they don't care. It seems the ""Love"" CD was the first and only project since ""Anthology"" that any of The Beatles oversaw the process before giving their final approval.

As for other video releases, we will NEVER see ""Let It Be"" I can guarantee that, but ""Magical Mystery Tour"" will eventually get a remastered release I'm sure. The Beatles don't have a say in releasing ""The Beatles at Shea Stadium"" as SOFA Entertainment (who bought up the entire Ed Sullivan catalog) has the rights to the concert special.

People have been moaning about a ""Help!"" remastered DVD release for years (since the AHDN DVD), they finally get one and they still complain. I don't get it.

When I first read about the Deluxe Edition, I thought the price would be around $50 like most other Deluxe Edition DVDs out there.  At $95, this is way too much for what they're offering.  Yes, you get all this:

- a reproduction of Richard Lester s original annotated script

- 8 lobby cards

- poster

- 60-page book with rarely seen photographs and production notes from the movie

... but unless they are signed by at least one Beatle, I wouldn't pay that much.  Yes, Richard Lester's annotated script is great, but wait awhile and you'll probably find a reproduction online sometime.  The lobby cards and poster are great, but those are not the main reasons for the price inflation.  The 60 page book would seem to be the main reason for the price hike, but look at other Beatles books out there.  The paperback version of The Beatles Anthology has 368 pages, weighs 2.2 pounds, and has over 1,300 photographs.  The price?  LESS THAN A THIRD of what this Deluxe Edition of Help is going for.

Yes, all these extras are nice, but it's not worth the price, and I'm a huge Beatles nut who buys everything they make.  At this moment, I'm going to buy the regular edition which has been restored with great picture and a 5.1 soundtrack.  Plus, the second disk has great extras (could be better if they had Paul or Ringo commenting) that will suffice.  Especially for the price.

719683,5,6303823351,"This has ALWAYS been my favorite Beatle movie.  Seeing it for the very first time brings back memories I shall cherish forever.

I remember my mom and I at a store one night, there was a drive-in a little ways down from it and it was a school night.  While driving to the store I got all excited because I saw that they were showing ""HELP!"".  I just went on and on about how I wanted to see it.  I was 11 and it was a school night.

While leaving the store and driving back home I turned myself around and kneeled on the carseat looking out the back window so I could see the screen while we past it, and then I fell over.  My mom had turned into the drive-in.  I looked at her in amazement and she said ""shhh, just don't tell your father""......

I had to sit through Blue Hawaii with Elvis first so by the time ""HELP!"" started it was pretty late.

It was the first time I had seen The Beatles on a big screen.  I didn't like them when they premiered on Ed Sullivan in 64 but between ""Yesterday"" then seeing them on Ed Sullivan in 65 and now ""HELP!"" I have been a Beatles fan the rest of my life.

I have listened and had them in my life every single day since then.

I LOVE ""HELP!"" and could watch it over and over again.  I have been waiting so very long for 'Apple' to finally 'refurbish' this great movie.

I had taped it many years later when it came on tv and had an audio-tape and listened to it over and over and actually wrote the script from listening and stopping it so knowing every line, well it's welded into my memory.

I taped it on my Cartrivision in 1973, taped it on Beta, then bought it on Beta, VHS and when the DVD came out the first time in the early 90's.

Maybe NOW ""The Fest For Beatles Fans"" will finally show this wonderful, funny movie again.......I'll just have to wait to find out.

If your a 'true' Beatles' fan this is a must to have in your collection even if you already own it, if you've never seen it before, buy it you won't regret it.  And if you aren't a Beatles fan buy it and bring back the 60's and your youth, you'll be happy you did.

719702,5,6303823351,"The Beatles score a coup with their film entitled ""Help!"" Some people write that this movie is a spoof of James Bond films; and they are right. The antics and music set it very far apart from any James Bond movie. The soundtrack to this movie positively shines! It includes the title track and ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl;"" ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away;"" ""She's A Woman"" and ""Ticket To Ride."" The cinematography is especially well done for the musical numbers.

The plot, as you may know, centers on a special ring that Ringo possesses; Ringo wants the ring but so do the members of an Eastern religious cult who need the ring for a ritual sacrifice. The members of the religious cult attempt to kill Ringo many times but never succeed. In addition, a mad British scientist also develops a keen interest in the ring. The crazy scientist character enhances the comedic value of this picture.

In a successful attempt to make the film even more unusual in a funny sort of way, the Fab Four enlist the help of Scotland Yard to protect Ringo and the other three members of the band. The attempts on Ringo's life so that the religious group or the mad scientist can obtain the ring are exaggerated even further for comedic effect with the not so brilliant ""services"" of Scotland Yard.

The cinematography's strength shines in the scenes filmed in the Austrian Alps and the island of Nassau in The Bahamas. You get impressive shots of the countryside and the seashore, respectively.

Amazon notes that there is ""relentless nonsense"" in this movie; and I strongly agree. The Fab Four go through a lot to protect Ringo and stay together: Paul is at one point shrunk to the size of a chewing gum wrapper; the religious cult tries to kill them countless times but never succeeds and John has to fish out a season ticket from some soup he is eating. Ringo and his band mates enjoy a happy ending but I won't write anything specific that could spoil it for you. The picture boasts a bizarre finish that complements the outrageous antics throughout ""Help!""

The quality of the sound is excellent and the witty dialogue will amuse you. I especially like the scene in which Ringo must whistle parts of Beethoven's ninth symphony in order to tame a tiger that could kill him so that the members of the religious group could finally obtain the ring.

I highly recommend this DVD for fans of The Beatles. People who enjoy spoofs of famous types of movies including the James Bond genre will love this movie.",1170547200,15,2496,4.623024830699774

I was a Freshman in college when the movie was released, and so it was a movie for the millions of Boomers like me, in that bizarre, wonderful time that was the mid-1960's in America.

Others have already written far more insightfully and fully than I intend to here. Simply -- if you like the Beatles, their witty, irreverent, and intellectual sense of humor, their music, and the whole 60's ""British Invasion"" period, you will surely enjoy this comedy. It was one last cheerful, happy, ridiculous romp for we teenagers of the 60's before the somber, discouraging misery of Vietnam settled in for a long, long time. It could be argued that, in a sense, my generation lost its sense of humor after ""Help"".... If a movie like ""Help"" were released today it would fall flat and be ridiculed, unless it were positioned as some kind of Austin Powers spinoff and ""spoof"" (how sick I've become of that word) of the ""Hippie"" period. Would this happen because as a people we never have regained that genuinely mirthful, joyous sense of humor that we revelled in in other Richard Lester movies, like ""The Three Musketeers"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", and Franco Zefferelli's ""The Taming of the Shrew""? You make your own call... my generation lived it.

Isn't it a pity that you can't buy ""Help"" new anymore? Isn't it interesting that the company that produced ""Help"" on DVD is MPI -- which is the same company that, despite overpowering demand, somehow cannot find it possible to release an even more popular, Academy Award-winning movie from the mid-Sixties -- ""Becket""? Isn't it a pity that you can't buy both ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" as a set? Isn't it a pity that no one makes movies like ""Help"" anymore?

*********** November 2007 *************  Much to my astonishment, somehow Capitol bought or won the rights to this movie away from MPI, and it's been released on two DVD editions. I bought one and enjoyed it quite a lot. I know the purists are going to be unhappy about the full-screen attributes versus the widescreen ones, etc., but the images are crisp, clear, and have rich color saturation.

Quite frankly my favorite attemt was number four he,he. But in 'another girl' we can only wish that Paul would wear that tshirt more often. and my stepsister finally realized that there are more rasons to like the beatles than their music. That is before John turned into mountain man\amish terrorist anyway.

Okay! Now I'll actullay reveiw the movie.

Help! was a clever movie, and had a plot! Imagine that!

Anyway, the movie was about Ringo comming into possesion of a sacred ring. that won't come off. Sooo, Ringo must be sacrificed. So high preist Clang, and Aimee end up trying to sacrifice him. Or Clang is anyway. Aimee's trying to protect him. Prof. Foot and his assistant Algenon are after the ring too. so the beatles end up getting chased everywhere. The bahamas, the alps you know.

It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy.

The plot is pure genius in its simplicity:  a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger.  A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice.  A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger.  The Beatles are absolutely clueless.  So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious.

719758,4,6303823351,"This updated review refers to the recent Deluxe Edition release of HELP! Bottom Line Up Front: The Deluxe DVD edition has quite a few extras, but the movie remains essentially the same as previous releases.  For purposes of this review all upper case references to HELP! refer to the movie, whereas upper and lower case entries, Help!, refer to the song.

HELP! took the group from their quasi-realistic beginnings in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT to a fantasy world where bad guys with evil plots are foolish enough to take on the Beatles.  In short:  Ringo dons a new ring on his finger.  Unfortunately the ring is a piece of sacrificial jewelry and the high priest, played by Leo McKern, travels to England with his henchmen to reclaim the sacred relic.  In their efforts to relieve themselves of the ring the Beatles are also pursued by a mad scientist, played by Victor Spinetti, and his assistant portrayed by lovable Roy Kinnear (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).  The on and off again chase follows the Beatles around London, Salisbury Plain, Austria, and the Bahamas.  Quite different from the simple plot in their previous movie.

Originally released in 1965, HELP! received generally favorable reviews, although over the years its popularity has been overtaken by its predecessor A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.

This is the fifth copy of HELP! I have purchased over the years.  The first was a remastered MPI VHS copy that was released in 1987.  This release followed a similar and prior year's re-release of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  In both cases the films were restored and the plan was to get the movies back into theaters.  Unfortunately in the case of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT the re-release had minimal distribution and thus was disappointing in terms of revenue.  As such HELP! went straight to VHS and laser disk.

It was great to finally have HELP! on home video, but the VHS version was not the same one originally screened in theaters in 1965.  Much like A HARD DAY'S NIGHT the mono music soundtrack was replaced with an overdubbed (or remixed if you prefer) stereo version.  Replacement of the mono track also removed - actually blanketed -- some of the film's original sound effects.  Of greater concern was that the replaced tracks did not closely match the Beatles' original lip-synching to a highly calibrated Nagra recorder.  This is not to imply that the original 1965 film gave the impression of live performances.  It is just that they looked and sounded better synchronized in the original film.

The most notable difference between the film and the subsequent releases is the replacement of the movie's theme song.  The original cinematic release of the movie features Help!, played at both the beginning and conclusion of the film, was identical to the version that appeared on the Capitol 45 rpm single (and later appeared on the Capitol Rarities album).  An ever so slightly increased vocal tempo version of Help! appeared on subsequent domestic and imported albums, as well as in the remastered VHS and DVD versions of HELP!  The last time we were treated to the virgin unaltered version of HELP!, complete with the original mono soundtrack, was several years ago on AMC.

Following the 1980s HELP! was released on tape two additional times and was subsequently released on DVD.  The DVD version was almost identical to the VHS release.  The special features were limited to film trailers, radio spots, and black and white stills and various black and white film footage.

The current deluxe set has a lot to offer in the way of extras.  There is a copy of Richard Lester's annotated script, a book with lots of color photos from the movie, five-by-seven reproduction color lobby cards, and a movie poster.  Additionally the set contains a special features disk.  The special features disk includes a short documentary on the making of the film including interviews with Richard Lester.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo are also heard in interviews taken from 1965.

There is also a segment regarding the color negative restoration and subsequent digitized cleanup.  No doubt a very time consuming process.  However the end result differs very little from previous releases.  This new release of HELP! was advertised as including a lost scene. Remember that A HARD DAY'S NIGHT advertised the same thing and the missing scene of Paul and one of the dancers ended up being nothing more that a couple black and white stills on the special features disk.  The same holds true for the ""missing"" scene in HELP!

The Deluxe Edition is worth your while if want to add the script, book, lobby cards, and poster to your collection.  Otherwise you are best served sticking with the standard edition.",1129507200,4,4697,4.888748419721871

I haven't read every review here, so I'm not sure if anyone has alluded to this film's tie-in with Rudyard Kipling's poem ""Gunga-Din"" directly.  But, there is a clear parellel to the religious cult pursuing Ringo and the religious cult in the story Gunga-Din, not to mention the film's tie-in with Ludwig Von Beethoven.  English actor Leo McKern revives that cult in a very comical way as does the rest of his cult cohorts.  Then too, there is Eleanor Bron; Victor Spinelli (who played the role of the television producer in ""A Hard Day's Night"" (and less notably appeared in ""Magical Mystery Tour""); Roy Kinnear (no relation to Greg that I know of); Patrick Cargill; Alfie Bass; and, others who can be seen in several other English movies and English television of the era, also mainly in comical roles.  The casting of this movie, aside from The Beatles themselves, was brilliant.  The only thing missing perhaps was Peter Sellers in the flesh, but you can sense Peter Sellers' spirit impacting upon this film.  I make mention of these items because I feel they only add to the tapestry that makes ""HELP!"" a really delightful, fun film to watch over and over again, standing the comedic test of time as much as the Marx Brothers, or, Crosby & Hope, Abbott & Costello, Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin, W.C.

The story is perhaps a bit politically incorrect now, but they manage to parody an Eastern cult without getting too racist. Little touches in the movie are the best part, with lots of quotables (""A thingie!

719852,5,6303823351,"...Has ALWAYS been one of my favorite Beatles movie! It's completely insane, full of good, improvisational-style comedy of the Monty Python type, (in fact, I can almost guarantee you that this film and ""Hard Day's Night"" inspired the Pythons directly, as well as the godforesaken Monkees!) and excellent tunes by JPG&R! Just about everybody from this film went on to very respectable acting careers in film and theatre, especially Leo McKern and Eleanor Bron. Roy Kinnear became Richard Lester's signature supernumerary. And I'm still amazed at Victor Spinetti's strong resemblance to Donald Nixon.

A completely zany flick, this film follows the boys as they establish themselves in a new set of linked cottages in a spiffy clean, quaint working class part of, (presumably,) London, with the sight gags starting immediately as an enormous organ pops up out the floor of Paul's section of the cottages; John selects and kisses a copy of his own ""Spaniard In The Works""; George instructs a bumpkin to mow his rug with snapping gag dentures and Ringo selects fruit and soda from his own row of vending machines!

Enter the villains. In the opening teaser, it is established that a cult that is into human sacrifice has noted that Ringo has possession of a gaudy ring that they have lost that is crucial to their ritual sacrifice. They immediately go to London to re-obtain this ring so they can conduct business as usual and it is up to Eleanor Bron, as the very pretty Ahme, to get the ring from the hapless drummer.

Craziness ensues as they chase the fabs from locale to locale to get the ring, first to the recording studio, then an Eastern restaurant in London, then the alps, then to London again and Scotland Yard and then to the Bahamas. About half the movie takes place in the Bahamas where we see the bulk of the music performed in the movie as well, and what we hear is among the Beatles best pre-psychedelic work...in fact, this is the beginning of the Beatles experimenting musically beyond the simple post doo-wop stuff they had BEEN doing up till that point. The very folk-rocky ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"" is performed after Ahme comes over to their side and it is perhaps the most moving pre-Rubber Soul/Revolver tune of theirs.

The first time I viewed a copy of this movie on VHS, the spoken dialogue in the flick was kind of raspy, but the songs were crystal clear with excellent stereo separation and cleaning up. I have yet to hear an up-to-date copy, and it may be awhile before I do, since MPI has stopped issuing the danged thing! Come ON, people...EMI, Apple...SOMEBODY, get this puppy back on the market!

Anyway....George and Paul are the ones who shine the most musically in the film and on the accompanying album, with John singing the incredible ""Hide Your Love Away"", the boring and overplayed ""Ticket To Ride"" amd ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"". It seems that John, except for ""Away"" is still somewhat rooted in the earlier days yet with his tunes here, while Paul and George are exploring the fringes of country/folk rock with ""I Need You"", ""Another Girl"" and ""The Night Before"". The film/album is also the first appearance of the sitar in anything by the Beatles, showing up in incidental music in the film.

The boys easily out-zany the Marx Brothers in this film, carrying themselves like a clever bunch of high school/college cutups with their own little in-jokes and routines for us to giggle at. Richard Lester became known for directing this sort of zany, farcical stuff, with only occasional forays into regular dramatic moviemaking. Unfortunately, since 1975, he has become very much the ordinary director, after creating masterpieces like ""The Three and Four Musketeers"", ""Robin & Marian"", ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum"" and others...

This is the Beatles at their all-stops-pulled cleverest, musically, theatrically and otherwise. Their charisma was immediate, and I guarantee you, you will become a fan by the time this movie is over.

The evil cult people try taking the ring by chopping off his finger in the resteraunt scene.  Oh, and that's where George Harrison was first inspired by the sitar. Anyways,after a few attempts (such as nearly destroying a bathroom), the ring still won't come off.  Eventually, they decide to leave for a few stops around the world, such as the Alps (where they go skiing and all heck breaks lose) and the Royal Palace in London. Ringo says some funny lines about how they won't get out of the Palace alive. Never-the-less, Klang finds him, along with the scientest dudes, but they don't play too much of a big part.  Klang gets his chance to kill Ringo.  But I won't tell you too much.  Some songs include Help!, Hide your love away, Lose that Girl, I Need You (Harrison), and Ticket to Ride.

Those memories stuck with me throughout the years and whenever I watch ""Help!"" I still feel ""young at heart"".  Granted many critics dismissed this film when it first was released.  I suppose they were expecting another ""Hard Day's Night"".  This film is pure fantasy.  The comedy is great but the music is even better.  The Help! CD is one of my favorite Bealtes' CDs.
Richard Lester is a brilliant director.  He knew The Beatles' limitations as actors and used them accordingly.
In this film you can see how The Beatles practically invented the music video.  Eg.  The Ticket to Ride sequence.

There is so much of the Beatles comedic personality here. You have Ringo pursued by the Cult, a Mad Scientist bent on (Dare We Say It)ruling the world while complaining about British parts in his scientific tools, Paul shrunk into an ashtray and coverd with soda (""ick, I'm all sticky..."") and John suggesting Ringo cut his hand off to save the free world.

Yes, the boys are gorgeous, so young, so talented, so sexy--and in COLOR this time. The music, as it always was with the Beatles, was innovative for its time, often brilliant. The very silly plot, in which some bad guys want to steal a sacred ring from Ringo's finger, is fun and ridiculous and infectious. But it only takes a close listen to John Lennon's title song, ""Help,"" to know that he was already in distress.
The demands on the Fab Four were getting more and more troubling to each of them. Just on the horizon, if not already begun, was time with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, heavy use of LSD, the John and Yoko saga, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heartclub Band, and all that was to come until the inevitable acrimonious disintegration of the group.
Viewed in hindsight, therefore, ""Help"" makes this reviewer sad. It is so seemingly happy and innocent, so ""60s,"" and yet the viewer knows that it all fell apart.

719927,5,6303823351,"I hate to review a movie that has already received 84 reviews, but I feel the need to add my voice to the cacophany.
""Help!"" is one of the finest expressions of the absurdist humor that began with Peter Sellers and the Goon Show (Sellers, Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine) and led to Monty Python and its many North American imitators (including the National Lampoon and Second City crews who gave birth to ""Saturday Night Live"").  This movie was the first large-scale exposure of such humor to the North American masses.
The Beatles idolized the Goons.  They were among the handful of people in England who knew who George Martin was before he became their producer ... because he had produced the Goons' records.  They were also among the thimbleful of people who knew Richard Lester before he directed ""A Hard Day's Night"" ... because he directed Sellers and Milligan in the 12-minute silent cult classic ""The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film"" (included here as an Easter egg).  ""Help!"" was the Beatles' attempt to emulate or even surpass their heroes ... and they succeeded magnificently, since the Goons were never filmed well except in Lester's short.
The plot is a classic ""chase"" movie theme: Ringo has the sacrificial ring of the goddess Kahili stuck on his finger and ultimately is designated as the next sacrifice, so the Beatles have to run, while a mad scientist and Scotland Yard are also in hot pursuit.  But the plot is insignificant.  Simply, the Beatles are put in one funny situation after another, with superb comedic support from Leo McKern (""Rumpole of the Bailey""), Tony Award-winner Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill.  The Goons couldn't have done it better themselves.
As another reviewer noted, ""Help!"" was also the beginning of the Beatles' most creative period musically, although only John's tunes in the movie stand out (""Help"", ""Ticket to Ride"", and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" -- Paul's ""Yesterday"" is on the soundtrack but not in the film).  But don't buy ""Help!"" for the music.  Don't buy ""Help!"" for the Beatles' performances (BTW, George is the best actor).  Buy it because it's hilarious, and it looks effortless.  (In fact, it looked so effortless that it convinced Paul that the Beatles could make their own comedy film without Lester -- which became the disastrous flop ""Magical Mystery Tour"".  But that's another story.)  Buy it to see the REAL Beatles, not the saintly whitewashed version being marketed today.",1021248000,,2497,4.959232613908873

The Fabs are as cheeky and charming as ever. John (my fave Beatle) is witty and sarcastic, Paul has a thing with the ladies, George shows he's not shy and that he's probably the best actor of the Beatles, and Ringo shows how loveable and funny he can be.
Of course, the music is awesome. My personal favorite song from the movie is ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" but they're all good. In the background, you can sometimes here instrumental versions of ""A Hard Day's Night"" too.

Ringo becomes the target of a crazed cult who pursues him because he wears ""the sacrificial ring.""  High Priestess Ahme (played by Eleanor Bron) leads a band of inept thugs on a wild chase, following the Beatles from England to the Bahamas.
Each Beatle maintains his own distinct, individual and unique personality and input.  John provides the quick quips, (""I'm into rhythm guitar and mouth organ,"" he tells one thug).  Paul provides the straight answers and is a serious foil to John's tendency to fall back into light banter.  George maintains a stoic pose and does not go along with popular opinion gladly.  In one memorable scene, Victor Spinetti, whose role in this movie is to protect the Beatles, claims he can do voice imitations from ""Cagney to Ringo,"" George grimaces and says, ""Doesn't sound A BIT like Cagney!""  He also tells a motoring thug who inadvertently picks him up, ""thanks for the lift, sailor!""
Ringo appears quite at ease with acting.  He maintains his lovable, good old Ringo persona and yet he shows a delightful streak of independence.  Ringo does not suffer a fool gladly and he provides many clever retorts throughout the movie.
I admit, I really enjoyed this movie.  I preferred the Beatles' first film, the 1964 classic ""A Hard Day's Night,"" but I do enjoy this one.  Since I love the Beatles and the song selections are excellent (from the sad, beautiful ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" to the rousing ""Ticket to Ride"" and a Harrison composition, ""I Need You""), I gave this one 5 stars.

He was an artist, not teeny bopper sex symbol.  This film must have degraded him. I believe this was what made him hate being a Beatle and made him break away years later.

A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was like a day in the life of the Beatles, which looked like it had a lot of inspiration from the classic era of silent comedies. Director Richard Lester this time gives us a great spy spoof at the beginning of the James Bond-Spy phenomenon that was just starting to take off at that time. We went from black & white to vibrant color in just one year. I think this is what is really interesting if you see the two films together. Both films are like night and day. Essentially we still have two films about the Beatles and the comic episodes they get in and out of but they are both filmed entirely different from each other. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is dryer and a more sophisticated looking film, which contains so many indelible images. The fun film HELP! is a wild and insane comedy-adventure with its own brand of sophistication and is truly a product of its time. These two films were released just one year apart yet they look years apart. These films are great masterpieces and are a record of just how fast life and styles changed in the decade of the 60s.

A religious cult is after Ringo because he is in possession of thier sacrificial ring.  There are several failed attempts to obtain the ring:  stealing it at night as he sleeps, grabbing it when he posts a letter, the elevator scene, getting the ring at a restaurant and even sawing around his drum set so he will fall through to the basement as the Beatles record ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"".  Despite these failures, Clang (Leo McKern), the cult leader, is more determined than ever to get the ring from Ringo!

Ahme (wonderfully played by Eleanor Braun), a priestess of the cult is secretly working with the Beatles to keep them out of harms way.

Added to the mix are two bumbling scientists Professor Foot and Algernon (Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear respectively), and a Scotland Yard superintendent played by Patrick Cargill.  To Cargill everything is ""famous"" (the famous Ringo, famous Beatles, famous plan).

John, Paul, George and Ringo are all charming as ever.  The settings run from England, to the ski slopes of Austria to the Bahamas.

There are so many funny things in this movie that you can't just watch it one time and catch them all.

The soundtrack to this movie is awesome:  ""Help!"", ""The Night Before"", ""I Need You"", ""Another Girl"", ""You're Gonna Lose That Girl"", ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"", ""She's A Woman"" and ""Ticket To Ride"".

Lo and behold, they totally re-infected me at age 44! We can't seem to get ""1"", ""Revolver"", ""Abbey Road"" and ""Rubber Soul"" out of rotation on our CD player. My kids and I also watch the DVDs of ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (which shows how truly hard core we are) every few days.
Anyway, I went in search of DVDs of ""Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" and found out THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. It seems they have been TAKEN OFF THE MARKET just as the Fabs were hitting Number 1 again across the land! Same goes for VHS tapes and DVDs of the ""Beatles Anthology"" and ""Compleat Beatles"" documentaries, all listed as ""out of print and no longer available.""
HELLO-- Who's reponsible for this FIASCO? Someone ought to be fired immediately for this, since there's no telling how much money is being lost minute-by-minute. The Beatles are once again the HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, and their best movie work is suddenly UNAVAILABLE?  The stupidity of this marketing move is almost inconceivable.
Anyway, I was lucky enough to find a tired, worn-out VHS tape of ""Help"" on the bottom shelf of the local video store and brought it home. The kids, of course, FLIPPED and I found myself once again amazed at what truly natural, charismatic performers the Fabs were.
Although rock critics have always liked ""Hard Day's Night"" more, I must admit ""Help"" has always been my favorite Beatles movie. Viewing it again after 20-odd years, I'm amazed at its innocent charm and how well some of the sight gags hold up. It's a sheer pleasure to watch all the proto-music videos in it, particularly the fabulous ""Ticket To Ride"" sequence (my youngest still screams ""The SKI SONG! YIPPEEE!"" whenever the opening chords come over the stereo). The Mad Scientist character reminded my girls of ""The Brain."" Some of the casually tossed-off lines have amazing staying power. ""A feindish thingee!"" ""You've got a plan, haven't you inspector?"" ""Not a bit like Cagney!"" ""Ah, you see? British! If I had a Luger..."" ""So these are the famous Beatles / So this is the famous Scotland Yard"" ""Lovely boys! Just the same as they was before they was"" etc.
The spirit of both ""Help"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" is definitely ""cheeky,"" as opposed to the ""snotty"" and cynical attitude adopted by today's teen-oriented music stars (don't believe me? Compare the excruciating ""Jose and the Pussycats"" to any Beatles flick and tell me we haven't gone BACKWARDS in 30-odd years in terms of music, talent and attitude). That's the only bad part of watching or listening to the Beatles in this day and age: It reminds you that pop/rock music is long into its decadent phase, with the themes so daringly explored by the Beatles and others so long ago simply being hashed, rehashed, sampled, computerized, and spat out by today's soulless performers.
Anyway, I would happily buy a ""Help"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" DVD IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE!  How long is this agony to last?",989798400,27,3061,4.7518796992481205

Apart from Mr. Starr's acting, George Harrison delivers a tremendous performance.  I think it's hilarious when George Harrison is skiing with a top hat on his head.
Also, the title track is superb.

For starters, all of The Beatles movies were made to promote the soundtracks that go along with them so to expect academy awards is obviously out of the question.  But maybe that's why HELP! and A HARD DAY'S NIGHT were so popular, they were actually good movies!  The humor is a completely new breed compared to American movies at the time and the creativity of the movie amazes me still!  For instance, the house that the Beatles live in appears to be four separate houses from the outside because there are four different colored doors for each individual Beatle.  But when they get inside it's all one room!  John's Bed is a pit in the floor, George's carpet is grass, Paul has an electric organ that rises from beneath the floor and Ringo (Although it was evtually edited out) had a cow in his room so he could get himself a fresh glass of milk whenever he needed one!!!  That's not even starting with all the crazy ideas they had for this movie, but I don't want to write out the whole movie for you so just take my word, it's classic!",985996800,10,1231,4.37280701754386

720026,3,6303823351,"Die hard fans of the Beathes will be the ones interested on this movie. But most Beatles fans never find out anything wrong with their work. Well, if we are honest, we will notice that Lennon's music sometimes sucks (Revolution #9) and that most of their records are not perfect (come on, you hate those experiments by George with Indian music).
In other words, when the Beatles are good, they are excellent (95% of the time), but when they are bad, it is ugly (5%).
I think ""Help!' falls in the five percent. The movie is about cult members and scientists trying to get a ring out of Ringo's finger. You think this will go for about 10 minutes, but too late you find out that's all what the movie is about.
I give three stars to the movie only because of the music. However, the songs are pushed within the film, as they are not related to the plot. At one moment, they are playing with snow while singing ""Ticket to Ride"". This comes out of nowhere.
Anyway, the movie is not good, but it is an opportunity to see the Beatles, together, and in witty behavior. Now, that is something that a fan will appreciate, even in a stupid movie as this one.",979344000,3,1147,4.339534883720931
720027,5,6303823351,"Now that it's been mercilessly ripped off by films like Airplane, and Spice Girls: The Movie and t.v. shows like The Monkees, can this  updated pop cousin of Helzapoppin still entertain today's audiences?
Maybe.
Certainly not like it entertained audiences in 1965 though, that's for sure.  I can certainly understand how anyone born after (say) 1965 will not quite understand why this very silly picture is held in high regard by many.  It's a pretty goofy film that relies quite a bit on bad puns,corny jokes and pre-MTV video pop star posing.
Oh it's colorful and energetic and a lot of fun in a cartoonish way, don't get me wrong.  It's also got some great music, with John Lennon's voice at its peak.  And if you look at the type of films they designed for previous pop stars : Bing Crosby, or Frank Sinatra or Bill Haley, or Elvis Presley-this film broke all the rules.  It's true that Bob Rafaelson and The Monkees t.v. show owe everything to director Richard Lester, and writers Marc Behm and  Charles Wood (III), who found the perfect way to present the fab four first in semi-documentary fashion with A Hard Days Night and then in a nonsensical farce that borrows it's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink frenetic style from such films/stage plays like Olsen and Johnson's Helzapoppin (from the 1940's)and the anarchy of the Marx Brothers of course.
There's a lot of smarts on display amidst the dumb gags though. Moments in which pop culture icons, and the cult of personality is questioned and lampooned.  The first time we see the Beatles, is quite impressive.  Neighbors watch the boys return to their row houses and comment how famous but still down to earth and likeable the lads are.  Then we go inside their pad and see an interior that had me on the floor in hysterics.  Rows of vending machines containing drinks, snacks and sandwiches, John sleeps in a compact sunken bed space in the floor that is equipped with several gadgets, a section of the pad has grass growing in it, and a butler/groupie tries to cut it with chattering teeth.  The visual and verbal puns and asides start flying right off the bat, and although many of them are groaners, some are still pretty funny.
When the film was first released, it was virtually impossible for audiences to hear much of the film because of the screams from excited fans in attendance.  Beatlemania was nearly at it's peak when the film was released.
I grew up with the Beatles, and though I was pretty young at the time, my old brother's fanaticism for the Liverpudlian wonders was contagious and I fondly recall the experience of sitting through the film not once, not twice, but three times.  A few weeks later I enjoyed it again, --twice.
You want to know what the plot is?  Leo McKern (the great British character actor) plays Clang, the Indian leader of a cult of Kali worshipers.  Ringo has received a ring from an avid fan, which turns out to be the sacrificial ring, the Kali cult needs in order to complete their sacrificial rites. They will stop at nothing to get the ring, which is stuck to Ringo's finger.  There are attempts to chop his finger off, there are visits to experts and finally a mad scientist to get the ring off Ringo's finger, but nothing will work.  In between the silly comic chases, there are several musical numbers and music video montages.  The chase takes the Beatles from England, to snow-capped mountains, to Bermuda.  Paul is briefly shrunk to the size of a beanie baby, Ringo is nearly eaten by a Bengal Tiger, and John is nearly run over by a tank.  Approximately 7 songs and 90 minutes later the entire film is neatly wrapped up and an ingenious end credit sequence ends the film.
Part of my affection of the film is nostalgic and I recognize that a lot of viewers are going to find the film an intermittently witty and utterly silly dumb Beatle ego fest that's only slightly better than a Pauley Shore movie.
Oh well.  I still love the thing.

The plot is highly contrived and completely implausible, and this is a GOOD thing!  This is not a failed attempt at a ""good"" story; this is ridiculousness in its purest form.  The story is basically as follows: Ringo receives an extremely large and garish ring in a fan letter from an ""Eastern bird,"" causing a variety of people to chase him around trying to kill him and/or paint him red.  My favorite line, spoken by George: ""Hey, it's a thingy!  A fiendish thingy!""

They were too ripped on pot while making  ""Help!"" to know what was going on.  This film is director Richard  Lester's favorite, and it's easy to see why.  Despite the Beatles'  protests, it's a visual and aural treat, crammed with gags, puns, sly  absurdist humor, spoofs of film, literature, music, and mores, and, of  course, stunning Beatletunes.  What more can anyone want?  Entertaining fun  AND a classic piece of British filmmaking.  BTW, keep an eye open for the  eerie harbingers of the Beatles' future lives/careers.  Indian influences,  mystical Stonehenge, tigers, bagpipes, psychedelia, the cameo appearance of  the 1969 Beatles, a gun pulled on John (but uselessly, since it's British),  thugs invading Beatle homes -- all this and more.  Kali is the goddess of  change, death, rebirth, and so it is fitting that after this movie, which  even takes the mickey out of the Great Goddess, nothing would ever be the  same for the Lads.",966902400,8,1102,4.934065934065934

The soundtrack is amazing: ""I Need You"" is beautiful,  if perhaps more obscure than the unforgettable title track.
