I thought that this movie was pretty good zoe did an excellent job. even though it's 3 hours long zoe makes you stick with it because of her amazing acting. and the guy who played guy was good. it is a mix of suspense and horror. but it was not really that scary. it was good but not scary. the acting is good, the story is good. the only thing I could say if that could really happen that is the scariest part of the film is giving birth to satan's son I would not dismiss the possibility mary gave birth to god's son and what makes satan any different. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1476576000,,635,4.0078740157480315
