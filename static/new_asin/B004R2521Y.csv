Whether it was intentional or accidental is irrelevant. Take off his act and the movie will be completely unbearable [not that it isn't].

Sohail Khan, Yash Tonk (referred to as TV Ka Salman Khan by Sohail) and Vrajesh Hirjee are three friends. The force behind the movie! There's also Aarti Chhabria, Amrita Arora and Khulbhushan Kharbanda.
The three friends are given a room in Kharbanda's bungalow and are like family. One day, Don decides he wants the bungalow for Rs 25 lakhs and forces Kharbanda to sign on the papers. That's when the Team, who were out in Goa to work on a music album, land up home just in time to save Kharbanda and his family from the goons. From then on, they take on the Don to teach him a lesson... and they win!

From the word go, its dishum, dishum, dishum... The force of the fight sequences is too much to bear. Mercif ully, there's Shinde and his act!",1304035200,,1061,4.549738219895288
