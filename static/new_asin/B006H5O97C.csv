8498205,3,B006H5O97C,"The Slasher... Is The Sex Maniac! - Directed by Robert Montero - In English - Fullscreen Presentation - 90 min.] Another gaillo finally sees daylight but, unfortunately, it's nothing to get yourself worked up about, seeing as it's released as a 'Cinema Classic' by Desert Island Films which, after viewing several of, have concluded to mean you only need to sit through if stranded on that desert island.

A great cast is assembled, at least as far as this genre is concerned - Farley Granger (at the tail end of an considerable career), Sylva Koscina, Susan Scott AKA Nieves Navarro, Krista Nell and Femi Benussi  (making this a veritable 'Who's Who' of 70's Eurohorror and cult starlets), and the plot a decent one, yet even if the print was good (which it's not), the editing and film complete (which it's not; it appears to have been edited with a tilesaw), the direction competent (ditto; this guy's a shoemaker posing as a director), we'd STILL come up short here, as the actors appear to be sleepwalking throughout, the pacing's incredibly sluggish and the abrupt ending tacked on like a horrible corsage to an uncomfortable prom dress (not that I'd know, but my imagination's decent, unlike this flick).

A series of married women are being murdered, all having their throats slit, all having affairs, and the killer leaves calling cards of photos of the adulterers engaged compromisingly with their men's faces scratched from the prints. Inspector Cappawana (Granger), married to Sylva Koscina, is getting nowhere fast and becoming the brunt of newspaper finger-pointing and blamed for the lack of a suspect. He confers with shrinks and autopsy experts trying to determine the killer's pathology - jealousy, impotency, hatred of women or psychotic rage? Susan Scott is the next door neighbor who's riding Farley's Harley when he's not working the case, but she's having her garden watered by another as well, and has a cuckolded crippled husband at home who's painfully aware of these things. Needless to say, more babes are slashed, more pics are left behind, and the only possible suspect is a Renfield-like mortician who does cosmetic reconstructions at the mortuary the women are brought to. But, having seen as many gailli as we all likely have, we know he's just another red herring in a fishy barrel that reeks like this film.

You'd think that with all these delectable Eurobabes and the hefty portions of nudity and sleazy scenarios heaved our way, we'd be content to sit through the downtime and wait for the film's merits to emerge, but finding them is as elusive as putting your hands on Gov. Romney's last ten years of tax returns. A languid pace, lack of tension, rudimentary direction are the culprits, and I found myself checking the clock and squirming in my seat one too many times before the unresolved, unsatisfying ending arrives. Even the soundtrack is bland and insipid.

Pass on this unless a gaillo completist (which I am) or a fan of the women involved (ditto) and/or Eurohorror and cult flicks from the 70's (check) until a decent, entire, widescreen edition of this emerges. Just don't hold your breath. A 2 star flick elevated to 3 due solely to the involvement of the women within, and for no other reason. Govern yourself accordingly.",1348012800,6,3274,4.923913043478261
