5721568,1,B00CFK5J6I,Very disappointing... 98% old footage -- not worth the $12.98... Especially if you already own the Shadow Chronicles! Save your money and watch on Netflix at some point!,1374537600,15,169,5.071428571428571
5721569,1,B00CFK5J6I,"This is just another slap in the face to the few remaining fans of Robotech out there. What was heralded as the next best thing since a Destroid, with so much hush hush talk dating back to 2 years ago about new animation and a new feature has been revealed to be nothing more than a cleaned up version of Mospeada's Love Live Alive epilogue with about 15 minutes of Yune animation that continues to retcon what was seen in episode 85 and 85.2 (RTSC). Dana Sterling's breast size was surely quadrupled for the sake of the Korean army fans that Kevin Mckeever or Tommy Yune stated in a panel as to the reason why every woman drawn in RTSC and beyond now wear Double D's.

At AX2013 this year we were shown a brief clip of what looks to be a Garfish cruiser narrowly escaping Southern Cross HQ's destruction...problem here was that the Robotech Masters targeted and destroyed the base in the final episodes of Southern Cross. Also talked about was the ""continued"" work on Shadow Rising is now in full force. What happened to the halting of all animation while WB worked on the live action movie? I'll tell you what, its dead in the water! Tommy even slipped and said the movie ""WAS"" under develpment, not ""IS"". Freudian slip if I ever heard one.

Save yourselves an hour or two if you go to a con and watch the youtube videos. Oh...the sneak peek we got of Shadow Rising was Janice charging at something as if she were Soi Fong from Bleach.

Hate to burst the bubbles of the fans out there, but you guys need to stop believing the smoke that HG year after year feed you. Until Yune gets replaced by someone with less of a diva attitude and more of a creative streak, you'll never be truly happy. And one more thing, this crap was never Macek's vision for Robotech, it was the Sentinels.",1373932800,15,1783,4.3969696969696965

Although a bit premature of me to rate this 5 stars since it has not even been released yet, it is rather wonderful thatnit comes with Shadow Chronicles,too as well as some great special features.

My only criticism is that we don't have this on Blu Ray.

Very disappointed.",1402617600,2,183,4.75
5721582,1,B00CFK5J6I,"Since this is the third or fourth release of The Shadow Chronicles, commenting on it is almost negligible at this point.

Love Live Alive, however, is a perplexing oddity.  Some background:

This project was announced 4-5 years prior to its release, mainly through Conventions and press interviews.  It was supposed to be some ""new movie"" which was teased via an image of one of the heroines in ""battle-ready"" pose (that never ended up being featured) and a trailer which comprised mainly of the new footage.  Further teasing revealed getting a number of old voice actors back, some out of retirement.

What we got was a glorified clip show recapping ""The New Generation"" portion of Robotech.  The ""new"" animation totaled around 3 and half minutes (a friend actually cut it down).  The new voice dialogue recorded, with the exception of Cam Clarke as Lancer, came out to 3-4 lines per actor, if that.

Basically, what comes across as a glorified DVD extra, like the extra short films you'd find on the DC Animated features, was hyped to fans for YEARS as a new film.  That's the most perplexing part of this whole release. On top of that, Love Live Alive has no extras, those were saved for complete box set which features this movie, the original Japanese Love Alive, and every other piece of Robotech ever.

Maybe if you saw Robotech as a kid, have no desire to re-watch it, but want to see what they've produced since 1988, this would be for you.  Otherwise, I can't think of anyone who would want this other than total completeists (if that's a word).",1401753600,9,1555,4.697416974169742
5721583,1,B00CFK5J6I,"I recently discovered that I'd missed a piece of Robotech called Love Live Alive and was excited to find it here in the two pack.  I already owned Shadow Chronicles, so I wound up getting this exclusively to get a copy of LLA.  This ""feature"" is a flashback-episode treatment of the entire 3rd war.  It has virtually no new material.and consists of minimally animated clips of Lancer talking with a reporter.  The ending has the only useful new material, and that isn't more than 5 minutes worth of video.  Sitting through the entire thing when I expected a new 90 minute Robotech movie and instead got a Invid War version of Admiral Gloval's report... well it's a huge let down.  Unless you have to have everything with the Robotech name on it, pass on this, and go pick up a different version of Shadow Chronicles, there are better options out there.",1401580800,9,852,4.6092715231788075

5721587,2,B00CFK5J6I,"as a child of the 80's i mostly remember Robotech as 'that show that had Jetfire from transformers in it'. now, i know the story of how Hasbro bought up all the molds they could get their hands on, and that included the Super-Valkyrie from Macross/Robotech. i didn't see many of the shows untill much later (90's and such) and then, because Id been playing Palladium Book's RPG RIFTS. since it was a pan-dimensional game, we ended up mixing the other books that Palladium had released, and for the hell of it, i began purchasing the Robotech line, acquired many of the Comico comics that retold it episode for episode in each issue (for instance, the macross portion was 36 episodes, the comic got 36 issues, same with the Southern Cross Portion as well as the Mospeada Portion. both got 23-24 issues, there was a special Graphic Novel to bring it in line with the Novels written by 'Jack McKinney' who was the pseudonym of two different authors (one of whom was Brian Daley).
the story grew on me for quite some time, i managed to get VHS copies of most of the episodes, and purchased all of the before-mentioned novels (including the 5 Sentinels novels, the closing 'end of the circle' novel, and the three 'between years' novels that were featured in other areas (such as the Zentraedi uprising era, what would have been the Robotech Movie, and the gap between Masters and New Generation).
The story, however, does not end happily. i parked most of my collection in comic boxes, kept the novels on my bookshelf, but drifted away from the series. and while i particularly enjoyed elements of the story, i wanted to explore the original elements which i did so (i own Animeigo's Subtitled Macross boxed set and love it). When Carl Macek (who had helped to create the american storyline for what became robotech) died, i had heard that they planned to make some changes and just figured 'meh, its their story'
What i saw was disheartening to say the least. while the first half of the film DOES do a good job of catching new readers up to the battle of reflex point (the climax of the original series) for anyone who read The Sentinels what came after was sickening. the story begins to jump into an altered version of the events leading to the beginning of 'The End of the Circle' and while, yes, the Haydonites (a race of robotic machine-people introduced in Sentinels) do serve as the de facto villain in the first half of the novel - it is because their absolute ruler Haydon has over-ridden their minds in his/her/its desire to trancend this universe. In this new story we learn that the Haydonites have ALWAYS been douches, planned to destroy everyone who used Protoculture (the alien power source inherent to the series) and even went so far as to trick EVERYONE involved.
not to mention that Harmony gold managed to piss of so many folks involved with Macross, that not only did they have to redesign everyone to nigh-unrecognizable designs, that they seemingly KILL half the cast in an explosion that we see on screen, but no bodies. not to mention that crappy design for the SDF-3 (which in the original storyline was taken by the Regis and the invid in her flight leaving earth either by accident or on purpose).
and when the climax does come its practically non-existant. i could compare This film to poorly written Fanfiction, but this is the new Canon. this is now how the story goes. and to make matters worse, the sequels to continue the story are stalled (rumors say that funding is on hold due to poor reception of this film)

Now: for the other half (which is why i gave it two stars as opposed to one) is the new portion: Live, Love, Alive. is actually a Mospeada OAV which has never been released in America before.  i haven't had a chance to watch it yet, and while New Generation/Mospeada isn't my favorite portion, i give some props to Harmony Gold here for actually trying something DIFFERENT that doesnt actually destroy any established continuity.
Which is really my primary gripe with the first half of this feature. The Shadow Chronicles doesnt add, it only takes away.
if HG and Tommy Yune would listen to people's complaints and criticism in order to make the series better, im sure that the series would be much better than it is.
for anyone who is a robotech fan or is trying to introduce others to robotech, i would reccomend that you only buy this set if you are interested in completeness sake or have no real attachment to the lost portion that was Robotech II: The Sentinels.",1392854400,,4513,4.6259351620947635

It would have been good to add the extra footage as deleted scenes for the 3rd robotech series.  Shadow Chronicles is mixed in my opinion, and the cliffhanger ending is a disappointment.

5721598,3,B00CFK5J6I,"Truth to be told, I was a huge Robotech fan back in the day...I picked up the role-playing sourcebooks, the Japanese imported model kits, got the Sentinels on VHS, went to the first Robotech convention...

But this release sort of puts me on the ""meh"" side of the fence...

If you've already seen Shadow Chronicles there's nothing new here that's truly worth picking up this release for (and I found the SC movie pretty blah at the time of its release...didn't like how they changed the ending of New Generation and sidestepped the Sentinels...it was a valiant effort but didn't recapture the magic of the original show)...

the Love Live Alive movie can best be described as unsatisfactory, even if it embraces everything that Robotech was when it was originally made.  It is essentially a clip show, with very little 'new' footage from the Mospeada film spliced inbetween with previously unused music from the cd releases finally put to good use, which wouldn't be so bad but its very obviously re-using the same intercut scenes of an interviewer with Lancer over and over again (once or twice I could bear but how many times do we need to see the darn tape recorder footage?).  The re-re-editing plays a little corny in this day and age...

It's a slightly modified version of Mospeada's Love Live Alive OVA, with some added scenes. It's pretty much 90% recap of the third Robotech war. The added scenes being about 5 minutes long tops.

If you need a Robotech fix, check out the comics and novels(the Sentinels was a great arc). Die hard Robotech fans will buy this regardless, but just know not to expect much.

5721609,3,B00CFK5J6I,"If you already own, like I did, Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles, you might want to consider skipping this re-release of Shadow Chronicles with the new New Generation movie, Love Live Alive. Unlike The Shadow Chronicles, which is an original movie and sequel to the New Generation Robotech series, Love Live Alive is really just a re-telling of the New Generation storyline from the perspective of a news reporter interviewing Yellow Dancer/Lancer using re-mastered footage from the New Generation series. If you are already familiar with the New Generation series then you already know that storyline and have probably already seen many of the episodes/adventures that are recounted in this movie. There is surprisingly only a few minutes of new animation added to enhance the story-telling, and a surprise twist ending to the Lancer story. This movie does, however, feel more authentic than The Shadow Chronicles, perhaps due to the use of original animation from the New Generation series. Shadow Chronicles felt like an unnecessary added-on storyline just for the purposes of making something new.  The last best thing done with Robotech was the re-mastering of the entire series. That was what the old time fans wanted the most. I don't know who keeps clamoring for more New Generation movies. I thought the New Generation series offered a perfect ending to the Robotech story, but that's just one old time fan's perspective. Re-watching the New Generation, which originally debuted on American television in 1986, makes me realize just how far ahead of its time it was. Today, the most popular sci-fi shows on television all bear post-apocalyptic/survivalist themes (""Falling Skies"", ""The Walking Dead"", ""Revolution"").",1377561600,2,1723,5.311355311355311

I guess the answer is because I'm a fan, but I was very unsatisfied. Being a fan I already had The Shadow Chronicles movie so I did not need another copy of that either. My guess is that they coupled the two together to make up for the less than stellar Love Live Alive. I will probobly never watch this DVD again and it will just sit there on my shelve.

This is a two movie collection consisting of ""Shadow Chronicles"" which has been out since 2007, and a brand new feature ""Love Live Alive.""  The two go well together, explaining why they are packaged as a two movie set, and should be watched in order with LLA first, flowing right into SC.  As a fan of the show since its original airing in the 1980s, and someone who has been associatd with the franchise for several years now, I had high expectations and found this to be very satisfying.  However, I can understand some of the less glowing reviews that have been posted.  The most important thing to know is what this is, and what it is not.  I think that any Robotech fan who knows the origins of the show would be extremely happy with this.

Shadow Chronicles has been out for a while, and I will not review it here, because I have already done so elsewhere.

What ""Love Live Alive"" is not:  Its not a brand new movie that continues the story of Robotech.  It is not filled with modern graphics and CGI.  It does not look ""new"" nor is it.  However, it is not simply a ""clip show"" as others have accused it of being.  It is also not in widescreen format.

What ""Love Live Alive"" is:  This is the Robotech version of the 1980s OVA ""Genesis Climber Mospeada: Love Live Alive.""  As you should know, Mospeada was the anime series that was transformed into the 3rd saga of Robotech ""The New Generation"" aka ""Invid Invasion.""  After the original TV run of the series in Japan, an OVA was released which was mostly a music video with some retrospectives on the events of the series.  This is the Robotech version of that OVA.  And while it really is a look back at the events of the show, it is not just a recycling of old footage.  Yes, most of it is reused from the show, but there is a good amount of new (or at least new to most of us) footage that came out of the OVA, as well as some new cell shaded CG footage at the opening, and as most have already mentioned, a great surprise right at the end.  The reason this is not in widescreen is because the 1980s footage was not widescreen, and it would be odd for the new scenes to be wide while the rest of the movie is not.

High Points:  The opening animation is outstanding, and we can only hope that HG will produce more like that.  The ""Flower of Life"" song that plays as the movie opens is fantastic, a perfect choice.  The original cast is back, including the narrator, who many thought passed away years ago.  Nope, he's back.  There is also a ""preview,"" featuring the voice of the narrator, after the credits.  Finally, if you haven't watched the series in a while, and haven't seen Shadow Chronicles, then LLA is a great review, and works well to catch you up before watching Shadow Chronicles.

As has been pointed out, if you look for it, you can definitely tell a difference in quality from the new footage, to the LLA OVA footage, to the original series footage, but I found this to be a positive.  The difference is not strong enough to be jarring, but was reminescent of the ""flicker"" in the extended cut of Chronicles of Riddick which helped you to identify the extended scenes.  I liked it.

I can also understand those who already own Shadow Chronicles and are not excited about LLA being bundled together with it, thereby giving you a redundant copy of SC.  To them, I say to think of SC as a bonus included with LLA, because this isn't priced like a two movie set.  Its actually pretty inexpensive, so go to a con, get the SC disk signed, and frame it on your wall or something.  Why not, you have two of them now.",1376870400,2,3681,4.316326530612245
5721616,1,B00CFK5J6I,TSC was a dreadful disappointment. LLA is something I will not be wasting my time on given that Tommy Yune would rather rip off the past or other artists rather than engage in the hard work necessary to bring any new life to Robotech.,1376265600,8,234,4.340909090909091

5721619,1,B00CFK5J6I,This is just a collection of old clips with embarrassing new dialogue intended to fill in the gaps.  I enjoyed Robotech as a child and thought this would be fun.  It was a waste of money.  I couldn't even watch 5 minutes.,1375488000,5,221,4.214285714285714
5721620,1,B00CFK5J6I,"I have been a Robotech fan for almost 30 years, and in that time I have followed the saga in its' many forms. Cartoons, comics, books, and more recently, on the internet. When Harmony Gold decided to continue Carl Macek's dream of an ongoing saga with Robotech: The Shadow chronicles, I was really excited. It had been many years, since any new material from the continuation of the Sentinels would grace our screen, and Harmony Gold delivered to us, in spades. The Shadow chronicles gave us fans, a new and interesting story. We were treated to a new adventure with familiar characters', while being introduced to new ones. Shadow Chronicles delivered on all fronts. It is a shame that the new Love, Live, Alive couldn't even come close to pleasing us fans.
  Love, Live, Alive is basically a bottle show. In 70+ minutes you get a recap of the entire New generation campaign, told from the eyes of Lancer, a soldier who also doubles as Yellow Dancer, a singer hiding from the Invid. Basically, this story picks out the major events from the saga, that the characters have to go through, and delivers us a shortened version of the entire campaign from crash landing to reflex point. All in original animation from the 1980's! I took the opportunity to watch the highlighs from the San Diego Comic Con Robotech panel, and was really looking forward to a new and interesting tale, perhaps something we have not seen in the previous episodes. But all it really came down to, was an interview that lasted 70+ minutes with only about 5 minutes of brand new footage, on the scale of Shadow Chronicles level.
  As a fan, I can truly say, that the folks at Harmony Gold, have missed the boat on this one. I would have expected a new an interesting story, that maybe we haven't seen in the original series. I would have liked to have seen a little more back story on Lancer. How did he join the defense forces? Did he fight on Fantoma with the Expeditionary forces? Maybe even more on his journey that eventually led him to join forces with Scott Bernard and assault Reflex Point.
  I really hope that the folks at Harmony Gold go back and make some big changes, or else I see this wonderful property in real jeopardy. The fans want continuations of beloved characters storylines. New and interesting locations. More dealings with the back stories of the sentinels. New and interesting mecha, or maybe an origin story of how Zor and the Regis first began a romance, that eventually leads to all out armageddon and universal war. Whatever the future holds for Robotech, I hope the producers, writers, and executives, take a long hard look, and move this property ahead. instead of lagging behind, and giving the true fans filler like this!!!!",1375401600,4,2732,4.68125
5721621,5,B00CFK5J6I,"Love Live Alive is a sort-of clip show from ""The  New Generation"" saga of Robotech with additional brand-new footage and returning cast members. Bottom line: it's great, a nice treat for old fans and a brief introduction for new fans. And love the easter egg after the end credits.

The Shadow Chronicles has been out awhile, so I'm just going to say it's a great addition to the Robotech franchise.",1375401600,3,399,4.685714285714286
5721622,2,B00CFK5J6I,"I grew up on Robotech in the 1980's. My fondest memories of my childhood was based on coming home from school to watch Robotech on TV and to see the newest episode of the franchise. I am also an adult collector of anything Robotech, Macross or Mospeda.

When I heard that a new Robotech movie was coming out, hell I was there to buy it ASAP! I must say with Carl Macek gone since 2010, I guess the lack of creativity went with him. Carl was an awesome person and truly loved the fans. I got to meet him several times at Comic Con or at the Shrine in LA. I think he would be pissed off at Tommy Yune and Harmony Gold for a lack of vision on this latest DVD.

Love Live Alive is ONLY a chronicle of New Generation told by Lancer. Quite frankly it leaves little to the imagination. I thought we would see a lot of new information about Scott leaving to help Admiral Hunter but all we saw was Lancer singing and then Sera pregnant and waiting at home for him which makes no sense to me knowing how both of those characters acted in the last 2 episodes of the finale of New Generation.

I was expecting to see more insight into the questions we all have since there is still a gap between The Sentinel's and Shadow Chronicles. I would have liked to have seen more as to what happened to Rook and Rand, Annie and Lunk and what happened to Ariel. I know Shadow Chronicles talks about a new story line but if you are going to use unseen animation from New Generation with a few newly created ones and merge them together, would you not try to showcase more information from a new story line? To just sit through an hour and a half recapping what happened in New Generation was a complete WASTE OF TIME and truly a wasted effort.

I will forever be a Robotech fan but seriously guys if you are going to put out garbage like this, don't do anything at all. I only hope that you DO NOT SCREW UP THE NEW LIVE ACTION MOVIE coming out in the future. Please do not do what Hasbro did to GI Joe and Transformers. Robotech means so much to me that I hope you respect the vision of Carl Macek.",1375228800,3,2075,4.141439205955335
5721623,4,B00CFK5J6I,it most rehash of new gen but still some new stuff. the beginning has new stuff. how ever some things should have been shorten and some times lengthen.  it bring lancer story to a close since the fourth robotech war is war fought out far from earth in search of std 3. amount of new animation is greater than five but less than ten. it was hard to count because they made some look to fit the old animation.  oh yea there is no big boob dana in the movie. we see her wearing new gen armor.,1375142400,,489,4.030927835051546
5721624,5,B00CFK5J6I,"I liked Love Live Alive, it was pretty good for a flashback movie. It was nice to see Dana leaving earth and some of the new scenes of stuff mentioned in the lore of Robotech that had never been animated until this film. Overall it's a nice lead in to The Shadow Chronicles. But I think unless you are a hardcore or medium Robotech fan it won't really have much meaning. Casual fans should really just watch the series. It's also nice that The Shadow Chronicles is now back in print, considering that old Funimation editions of the film have been out of print for a few years now. All the extras on the 2 disc edition are on this version also. Watching Shadow Chronicles again for the first time in a few years its still pretty good. In all I get why A&E put these two films together, think of this set as a supplement to the Complete series set they put out a couple of years ago. Buy this and that set and you are up to speed on all the animation created for Robotech up to this point.",1375142400,,987,4.172774869109948

5721626,4,B00CFK5J6I,"This is a warning for those looking for new episode this is not it.  Love, Live, Alive looks as if Harmony Gold took some re-edits to make a film with the same voice actors/actresses (not a bad thing).  The film talks about what happen after ending of the Southern Cross and before the Invid arrived on Earth to harvest the protoculture.  After that, Lancers summarizes the adventures of the New Generation.  It's not bad but do not expect a lot.  I wish Harmony Gold actually created a new cartoon to show what happen during this period.  I read the book ""Before the Invid Storm"" by Jack McKinney and it's an excellent read for the Robotech fan.  This book talks about everything from the 15th Squadron leaving Earth for the Robotech Expeditionary Force on Tirol to Jonathan Wolf returning to Earth.  Harmony Gold could of hit a home run but chose to do a half-a$$(sorry for my language but it's the truth) effort.  I wish HG would make new episode of the Shadow Chronicles.

The Shadow Chronicles movie was the highlight,  the animation kicked butt.  Love LIve Alive's cartoon animation took a step back.  As far as I'm concerned, I just bought another copy of  The Shadow Chronicles.  Just doesn't seem right.",1374796800,5,541,4.846153846153846
5721628,5,B00CFK5J6I,"How does Robotech: Love Live Alive do in the face of various expecations (some misplaced), here's my point of view.

THE STORY

Gotta say, I really liked it! Tommy, Greg, Cam especially, you guys did an excellent job on what could've turned out to just be a copy-paste of Mospeada's original Love Live Alive. Far from it, what we have here is something of a cross between ""Dana's Story"" and the Gloval Report movie some may remember, but with the added twist of some new footage. Not a whole lot, but some.

Going into Love Live Alive, know to expect the movie equivalent of a flashback story (ergo 'clip show') as nearly the whole story recounts The New Generation, but I re-emphasize I got so much more out of it than that. As opposed to the super-long music video vibe the Mospeada version has, Robotech's perspective explores what made the characters and their interactions. The core of their journey toward the Reflex Point destination.

One tweak I really liked in this flashback story, along with Lancer's narration, came with some of the character introspections given by him and going back to the 'present' as Lancer relates his life to a very friendly reporter. Speaking of, REALLY loved Kay, an amusing personality that helped really make those brief moments surprisingly cool. Again though, expect more a retrospective on the Third Robotech War than where he is beyond that.

Make no mistake though, for Lancer's past before he meets Scott's team and afterwards, we get some damn cool material IMHO. The opening few minutes are VERY memorable as we get the return of Robotech's original Narrator alongside a whole new tie-in point of view for the Invid invasion, it's so cool seeing stuff come together that originally the mid-80s couldn't pull off. Big YAYS to seeing SX Point 83 become Reflex Point, 10th Mars' battle, Dana cameo~

That's stuff near the beginning of the movie, while near the end is when some more fun stuff happens! We do get some singing from Michael Bradley as Lancer, even if it was recorded years back, we get an incredible rendition of his own ""We Will Win!"" (a cool parallel to the end of The Shadow Chronicles btw!) and a very beautiful scene involving ""Lonely Soldier Boy"" that brought tears to my eyes. Yes, I'm serious.

You guys should know, the voice actor that gets the most chops flexed turns out to be Cam's role as Lancer, he's kinda in the same position Dean Stockwell was for that Galactica ""The Plan"" movie. The rest of the VAs do return (I admit it was hard making out where Admiral Hunter's archival cameo was), but their new time is short and they don't get nearly the same amount of perspective as our Yellow Dancer. Not that that's a bad thing, but again, go into this knowing what to expect, Love Live Alive is Lancer's story.

The very end of the movie, snap, there's such a HUGE spoilery moment right before the end-credits that changes EVERYTHING in the Robotech universe. I really don't wanna give this one away, but needless to say it does move the story forward contrary to what many were afraid this story wouldn't do. While this is hyped as a sidestory, the 'present-day' events appear to be set slightly right after the end of The Shadow Chronicles, least that's the impression I got during a camp fire scene with the whole team.

If you guys want me to give away the end of the movie, I will, but I REALLY don't want to... BUY this release if only for Love Live Alive alone! You can watch it before or after The Shadow Chronicles, I say the latter as well because we get a very cool something after the end-credits! Remember how I mentioned the original Narrator's return, well, see for yourself...!

THE ANIMATION

Well, the animation quality, I really like what we got! For the majority of the story that gives us a New Generation retrospective, it appears that Harmony Gold uses their Remastered version and all the better, while their remastering job on the original feature-exclusive stuff is pretty dang good. You guys should know about the aspect ratio, in staying true to the original New Generation and Mospeada feature, the entire movie is in 4:3.

Despite being a fullscreen format, it doesn't appear anything substantial was cropped from the sides of the all new animation's material. Speaking of the new animation, it's very interesting how this worked out, it's done rather similar to the style of the original anime more-so than The Shadow Chronicles' updated designs. The new stuff mainly applies to the pre-2042 flashback stuff and some very interesting material near the end.

I think both sides of the animation melded pretty well together, even though I prefer The Shadow Chronicles' quality a bit more and hope Shadow Rising is more along those lines, gotta admit it'd be nice to see mecha battles along how the 10th Division's is presented here. Mind you all I'm no animation expert myself, but I have seen the original Mospeada feature and it's very cool seeing that spirit maintained and respected so well. The new stuff, there ain't a whole lot, but I love it!

THE DVD FEATURES

Really wish we could've gotten a DVD commentary with Tommy and some of the guys, maybe they can still do a podcast on it some time (I'd pay for that!), it would've been very neat hearing their thoughts on both this story and the original New Generation arc. LOVE the teaser trailer included, pre-production gallery's sorta neat, just wish we could've gotten a TAD more. Remember for Shadow Rising, my friends?

I did like seeing some of the originally Blu-Ray-exclusive features on The Shadow Chronicles' new DVD, the Robotech 3000 motion-capture thingy for instance. Skimming over that disc, all around looks good, all the original collector's edition extras of that have been kept. So yeah, don't worry about having yet another copy of this feature, ya' get new extras material if you didn't get the Blu-Ray and a back-up for a very cool movie.

SOUND EFFECTS / MUSIC SCORE

Sound effects are amazing, a very fine job done. Being someone who doesn't mind the Remastered version having upgraded/extra sound effects, that whole aspect's never bothered me, so it doesn't bother me during the New Gen footage in Love Live Alive. Oh and just found out the reporter's name rewatching the end-credits, I believe it's Kay, Wendee Lee did an awesome job voicing her.

There's only a few Michael Bradley songs, but I love what's included, especially his take on ""We Will Win!"" which I don't think was in the original series. Gigi Agrama also sings an amazing piece called ""Fool for Love"" that'll keep ya' hooked during the end-credits until the Narrator's lil surprise after that. On the note of music scoring, there's also an eerie sounding new take on Musica's ""Flower of Life"" theme at the movie's start, it really pulls you in before the first line.

WRAPPING UP

The case is very cool, I like the exterior packaging and Lion's Gate did very well in how to keep the discs safe. I'm now including it with my A&E set and stashing my older Collector's Edition release from FUNi alongside my Protoculture set. All around, LOVE this new Robotech material!

Thank you, Cam Clarke! Thank you, Greg Snegoff! Thank you, all the returning cast! Thank you, Tommy Yune! Thank you, Harmony Gold! You have a VERY happy customer who is VERY ready for Shadow Rising. Peace out and remember, that Protoculture will always be in my blood~",1374796800,4,7388,4.750975800156128
5721629,3,B00CFK5J6I,"As a true Robotech Fan, I am sad to say I'm disappointed in this latest release.  I gave it 3 stars only because I'm a fan & I'll buy anything with Robotech's name on it.  But sadly, the bottom line on this movie is that it's just a recap of the New Generation series.  Just as Cpt Gloval did in the first series with Gloval's Report, Love Live Alive is told from Lancer's perspective as he is asked questions by some sort of reporter or magazine writer.  Even the few cut scenes with Lancer telling the story are repeats of one new scene that they did for the movie... each scene features a look at the tape recorder then a shot of lancer removing a towel or scarf from around his neck.  At the very end, we do get a few new scenes of Lancer & where his story continued at the end of New Generation, but those scenes are only 2 or 3 minutes long.

Even Shadow Chronicles was a rehash or mash-up of the whole New Generation series, just told from yet another perspective.  I don't understand why Tommy Yune & Harmony Gold can't create new movies that follow the original book series by Jack McKinny (yes, I know it's 2 different writers).  ""Jack"" painstakingly wrote the books with Carl Macek's blessing and input to ensure the proper continuation of the series.  So, Tommy, The all the scripts are already there... you just have to create the video portion of it.  The books fill in so many gaps before the cartoon series, between the generations, and after the cartoon series.  Fans don't care for re-imagining of the stories (you hear this Toby Mcquire??).  You could create a live action movie that follows the books or the cartoon series to the tiniest detail & fans will love it, fans will continue to see any additional movies... just to see it in live action.

Enough ranting... Can Robotech fans do without this combo pack - yes.  Do true Robotech fans need this, well... yes.  Each dollar that this movie pack makes helps to ensure Tommy Yune & Harmony Gold understand that fans want to keep Robotech alive.",1374796800,22,2017,4.4577656675749315
5721630,4,B00CFK5J6I,"I'm a big fan of the original series, so for me this is a must.  Robotech Love Live Alive is basically a recap movie with info about the show in general but mostly about the third saga, told from the perspective of one of the secondary characters.  This release is really targeted at the fans who have kept the show alive over the years.  If you are a new comer you should start with the original series.  If you are an older fan that has been away you may get the most out of this.

The story is well told, the chosen scenes are effective, and the new animation looks great though doesn't quite blend perfectly.  The original voice cast reprised their roles, and most deliver great performances.  The sound and music are stand outs with classic tracks coming through and the audio coming across crisp.  I would have liked to see more special features, but the inclusion of Shadow Chronicles and its laundry list of features will keep you busy.  If you already have a copy of Shadow Chronicles you can gift the extra or use it as an awesome Robotech themed Coaster!  Most importantly, this release saw the return of Robotech's iconic narrator to the production, the nostalgia levels are off the scale!!!

If you fit into this releases target audience, it is a good buy.  The hardcore guys get some interesting new story and animation, though only a little bit, the returning fans get a great refresher and a copy of the movie that they may not have known was released.  Just the other day I met a fan who had not followed the show in years and had no idea that the movie was released or that the show was even on dvd, but he instantly recognized my laptop background (the AGACs if you must know).  The newbs can use this as an entry to the show but really should start with the original series, the discs are really inexpensive these days compared to what I paid for my first set.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Complete-Original-Series/dp/B005DTGAQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The Complete Original Series</a>",1374710400,6,2071,4.846590909090909
5721631,4,B00CFK5J6I,"It seems that a lot of people have complained about how little new there is in Love Live Alive rather than reviewing the set as a whole. A few cogent points:

1) Yes, LLA is about 90% clip show by weight. This is disappointing if you came into it expecting a whole new story (let's face it, Harmony Gold's marketing machine is largely to blame for that, by offering a fairly nondescript and potentially misleading blurb about the show right up until it was released), but if you look at it for what it is--a ""good parts"" abridgment of New Generation--it's really not all that bad. Reactions to The Shadow Chronicles movie over the last few years have made it clear that such a thing IS needed. It's been so long since the original Robotech, and Shadow Chronicles relies so heavily on New Generation's backstory, that it can really be confusing to people who don't remember Robotech that well (or have never seen it at all). Plus, it hits enough of the high points of the series that it's worth a spin all by itself if you're feeling nostalgic for New Generation but don't want to sit through 9 hours of it.

2) The newly-animated footage is quite good (all three or four minutes of it), and the footage from the not new but largely unseen ""Mospeada: Love Live Alive"" OAV is nice to see. (And given that the original LLA was ITSELF largely a clip show, Robotech: LLA incorporates nearly all of the new footage from that, too.) For people who complained that their favorite New Generation characters were given short shrift in (that is to say, were mysteriously absent from) Shadow Chronicles get a little bit of resolution here--complete with new dialogue from the original voice actors.

3) The Shadow Chronicles is still as exciting a Robotech sequel as it ever was. It has its rough patches, but it's still great to see and hear old familiar faces and get a little closure concerning what happened after New Generation ended. If you're in the market for a Shadow Chronicles DVD at all, it's worth having. It might even be worth having if you already have one or the other earlier editions, because this new one has all the content of the 2-disc Collector's Edition plus one more featurette and several more deleted scenes and animatics. (It uses a higher-capacity disc so it can compress both discs from that set into one with little or no loss of quality.)

4) It's highly unlikely that LLA will ever see Blu-ray release by itself for the same reason it's doubtful the 85-episode Robotech series will. Given the age and resolution of the materials that make up 97% of it, it would probably see little improvement in quality from a Blu-ray transfer; it would just make the film grain more obvious. Play it on an upscaling Blu-ray player and it will still look pretty decent. And $13 [what it costs right now] is an entirely decent price for the two movies together, especially if you can pass your current Shadow Chronicles disc on to someone else. For crying out loud, do you remember how much it cost to buy Robotech when it came out on VHS at two episodes per, especially in 1980s and 90s dollars? You should be delighted to be paying so little for even just Shadow Chronicles itself.

5) Buying it helps show Harmony Gold there's still enough interest in Robotech to move forward with REAL sequels, and gives them more money to do it with.

I'm not saying that either one of these movies is the greatest thing since sliced bread. In fact, I'm highly ambivalent between whether to rate it 3 or 4 stars; I might go with 3.5 if it were available. But if you get over your disappointment at LLA being a clip show, there's still a lot here to like.",1374710400,6,3649,4.554878048780488
5721632,4,B00CFK5J6I,"I watched my copy last night.

If you have seen Mospeada LLA you know some of the new footage but the Robotech LLA is a very different film. Mospeada LLA is a concert tribute montage to the entire Mospeada show. Robotech LLA is a Tribute via a recap of the New Generation with some new footage and surprises and not nearly as much music.

It is a great recap of the New Gen storyline through Lancers POV. The opening is really cool with the flashback to the 10th division drop and the 15th ATAC core retreating from the Invid Invasion. From there it goes into Lancer talking about his personal journey to Reflex Point. The people he meets and the encounters they have. The middle 45-60 minutes is all pretty much recap footage from the remastered New Gen with some Voice Over by Lancer. The last 15 minutes are most of the footage from Mospeada LLA with Lancer reuniting with his friends as they send Scott off. The very end is the surprise.

It is not without faults though. I myself having watched Mospeada LLA a few times knew all of that footage and I feel it could have been used just a bit better. There was not enough songs I feel. Maybe insert the concert footage with the Robotech versions of Lancers Songs in between the recaps.

Animation wise I feel the new battle footage was pretty good. The 10th division/15th Squad stuff is really cool. I hope they use that technique in any future movies like Shadow Rising. The new 2d character animation I feel was not as good and did not quite match the original Robotech/Mospeada LLA animation. It is close though but for vets you will be able to see it instantly.

I recommend it for the Robotech fans especially if you love the New Generation or if you are just a casual Robotech fan you may love it as a condensed version of the 3rd war to get you ready for Shadow Chronicles. It would have been nice to have the original Mospeada LLA on here too with sub-titles but maybe they will release that later.",1374710400,2,1959,4.415512465373961
5721633,5,B00CFK5J6I,"If you are a fan like I am, you will not be disappointed. Shadow Chronicles is one of the best add on movies since the series ended in 1986. The story continues right after the end of the 3rd series. Then starts its own story. The new story is very good and I wish they would make another. I read a review saying this movie is OK but not really for fans. FALSE.
There is nothing I saw in the movie that contradicts anything from the series. They even brought back the original voice actors.
Now about Love Live Alive. Its OK at best. I bought it just for my collection.",1374710400,,569,4.135135135135135

While having been to the Robotech Panels at various events, and asking Tommy Yune questions.  Love Live Alive was the only ""episode"" not brought from Japan, when the rest of the Robotech series was brought over.  So it made sense to bring it over, clean it up, and use it to ""officially"" tie in Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles.

For the people who are complaining about the ""standard TV"" format, make sure to do your homework, this is not a ""brand new movie"" this was originally done back in the 80s.",1374710400,4,699,4.604838709677419
5721635,1,B00CFK5J6I,"Robotech is one of the greatest sagas from the 1980s despite the fact that Harmony Gold uses it to block release of Macross related product in the USA.  After the release of the sequel Shadow Chronicles, which was really more of a set up to continue the saga, we get...Love, Live, Alive?  Fans have been wondering what happened to Admiral Rick hunter for over 25 years but we're treated to another rehash of events from the New Generation along with a few minutes, that's right minutes, of new footage.  The Robotech story isn't propelled by this LLA.  Instead, it makes you mad that you bought this to rewatch footage you already own from one of their 5 previous DVD releases (still no Blu-Ray).  Your consolation prize of the Shadow Chronicles (which actually has gotten more annoying over time) being included in this set is laughable as well as every fan already has either the original DVD release, Special Edition DVD, or Blu-Ray.

Bottom line, LLA was promised as a ""new"" Robotech ""feature"" but it's basically a cut and paste job lacking any creativity.  Afterall, they couldn't even come up with their own title since ""Love, Live, Alive"" was the title of the original Mospeada version of this feature.  The only reason I would tell you to buy this is set is if you really like the single new picture on the box art of the alpha fighter in battloid mode (the cyclone and alpha in guardian are reused images).  Still, be prepared for disappointment as if you were attending one of Harmony Gold's Robotech Convention Tour panels.",1374624000,42,1534,4.715355805243446
5721636,4,B00CFK5J6I,"Being a Transformers fan myself, it was a bit unusual that I was introduced to the Robotech series through the pen and paper RPG series.  But ever since then, I've tried to follow the series the best I could.  Of course, being a kid from the 90s, and not having access to cable until middle school, I was unable to watch most of the series until the DVD releases, and even then, only recently have I managed to at least watch most of the Macross Saga, and a few scant episodes of the other two seasons.

First off, let's talk about The Shadow Chronicles.  This two pack was the first time I watched the movie, and to be honest, it was quite good.  The story is about a betrayal from a new alien threat, and the human forces having trouble coming to trust their former alien enemies.  A common theme in the Robotech series since halfway through the Macross Saga.  The animation is quite good for it's time (being this movie is about three years old), and the top notch voice work sells the story quite well.

Now let's talk about the second movie, Love Live Alive.  This whole movie is a complete recap of the final season (AKA: The Invid Invasion) told from the perspective of one of the main characters.  There is a bit of new animation here and there, but it feels inconsistent since the majority of the movie is footage from the original series, with additional interview scenes done in the same style.  It feels disjointed at times because of this, but these new animations are very few and far between.

Again, as I said before, this is the whole final season condensed into a movie with some commentary from the character here and there.  If you've seen Robotech to death already, this will turn you off.  However, for people who don't have the time to watch the entire series, or people like me who have yet to see Robotech in it's entirety, this is a great condensed way to see the events of the third season.  The movie even ends with a reunion, hints at a third movie (then again, we know it was coming after the first one), as well as has a surprising conclusion to this particular character's story.

All in all, if you already own the entire series on DVD, there will be little to convince you to buy this set.  But if you're new to the Robotech series, this is a great way to experience the third season until you have the time to watch the third season from beginning to end.  And even if you do own the series on DVD, this is a good way to watch Season Three if you just want a brief recap, and see a little of what the characters have been up to since the end of the final season.

And here's the hope that we can get that third movie.",1374624000,4,2652,4.2997987927565395
5721637,3,B00CFK5J6I,"As many are saying, this was mostly a recap of the New Generation saga with some new footage.

I'd heard about a plothole concerning the destruction of Southern Cross HQ(which was destroyed in the end of the Masters Saga) and after watching the supposed scene, I'd like to give my thoughts on it. To me, it didn't look like Southern cross HQ at all, just a scene of the invid invasion where the remnants of Southern Cross escaped. All in all it was just a small insert to show that Dana Sterling(and presumably her friends like Bowie and whatnot) survived. Just a bunch of destruction, no indication as to where they were during the scene. But her survival was already shown in other media(that probably not everybody saw)

The real piece of gold in this I would say is at the end when you see that Lancer actually settled down with Sera and is going to be a father.

Also the complaint about how this is all old footage is a moot point. Robotech was built by mashing up old visuals and adding new dialogue. And Robotech was also no stranger to recap episodes. So bundling the OVA short of MOSPEADA with scenes from the New Generation and some new footage to make a movie is pretty creative.

Overall, I don't see a problem with Love Live Alive other than that it should have happened about eight years ago prior to the release of The Shadow Chronicles. That and the new footage kinda stands out a little compared to the old remastered footage.",1374624000,4,1444,4.479087452471483
5721638,1,B00CFK5J6I,"I'll keep this short.  The Shadow Chronicles is boring and a pale substitute for the recent Macross series that HG refuses to let get released in the US.  I found myself losing interest in the first 5 minutes and barely made it through to the end.

Harmony Gold is a horrible company, and they've even gone so far now as to sue Hasbro over vague similarities between Macross Valkyries and Hasbro's SDCC GI Joe/Transfoemrs toy.  Boycott their products--They don't deserve your money.",1374624000,11,482,4.841463414634147

Though, it does provide a nice ending for the Lancer/Yellow Dancer story. The second disk makes up for the first disk. It has Robotech:The Shadow Chronicles. This is a continuation of Scott Bernard's story. It is quite obvious that it was intended to be the beginning of a new series. Unfortunately, it was never picked up. It has much better production values and starts off on what looked to be an interesting story.",1374624000,3,549,4.612244897959184
5721640,1,B00CFK5J6I,"This is the first time I've written a review for a product purchased on Amazon. I have the Robotech series and Shadow Chronicles. I was so looking forward to getting this DVD (even though I would have preferred a Blu-ray format). However, words can't describe my disappointment when I put Love, Live, Alive into my Blu-ray player. Love, Live, Alive is simply a clip show of the New Generation series. It really adds nothing to the Robotech universe.

I should have guessed something was up when 1) Love, Live, Alive was only being sold as a combo pack with Shadow Chronicles and 2) while Shadow Chronicles was in widescreen format; Love, Live, Alive was in full screen which looks HORRIBLE on a widescreen TV. After the effort put into Shadow Chronicles; Love, Live, Alive was an utter disappointment.

If you already have a copy of Shadow Chronicles, there is no reason to shell out the dollars to add Love, Live, Alive to the universe. In fact, go out of your way to buy Shadow Chronicles by itself if you want to add it to your collection. There is no reason to add Love, Live, Alive.",1374624000,93,1087,4.569230769230769

8581341,3,B00CFK5J6I,The Love Alive addition felt more like an alternate ending to Robotech: New Generation - Hollow Victory (#14).  However this is only a promo clip.  The full CD version of Love Alive is just an alternate ending at most. If you want to see it then seek the DVD version of Love Alive which is about 90minutes in length.  Fan creations exist on YouTube which is a reduced version of it.  In my opinion they should have re-released the Hollow Victory DVD and altered the ending to have multiple endings with this included to the existing one.  That would've made more sense than trying to make it stand on it's own and a promo only with the Shadow Chronicles. The Love Alive Alternate ending provided some interesting future possibilities if given a chance which it wasn't.  Fan YouTube recreations to the rescue!!!,1514160000,,810,4.669014084507042

I would give the 1 star, but instead I give this DVD set 3 stars because it comes with The Shadow Chronicles.  That movie makes this worth getting if you don't already have it.

The second movie, ""Love Live Alive"", was a nice recap of the ""New Generation"" from the perspective of Yellow Dancer.
