4519347,5,B00514HM0Q,"Starts out a little weird.  OK, a lot weird, the story builds nicely.  Like true life some really nice things happen for the young star in her sad little life. Yet also as is the case in real life, you have to live it and that's where things get a little messy. A really good film.",1319328000,2,281,4.0
4519348,5,B00514HM0Q,"This is a great movie for the 12+ crowd!  It is about friendship, self-confidence, teamwork and learning that growing up can suck but it can also be fun.  The movie is filmed in wide shots that are colorful and lush.  The actors are authentic kids and teens who come in all shapes, sizes and walks of life.  The story unfolds creating a sense of living in a world of sherbert colours where pastels can cure any harshness.  Dear Lemon Lima is a fun, sweet movie that you will remember long after seeing it.",1312329600,2,505,4.387096774193548
4519349,5,B00514HM0Q,"Quirky and engaging coming of age story integrating life lessons, challenges, heartbreak, redemption, hope, and the overarching theme that kindness matters.  There is humor.  There is engagement.  There are stories of  empowerment of self, reflection, individuality, friendship, challenges, coping, unity, community, competition, triumph -- and perspective. What matters is not ""winning"" -- 'beating' another team, receiving accolades or a trophy. (But this may be easier to accept after having an empowering 'victory' and tapping into a 'will to win' with supportive similarly situated friends.)  Importantly, there is tragedy; there is child suicide (off screen) with the gunshot heard (a death ostensibly caused by smothering protective parental love).  This changes, for me, consideration of the appropriate age for viewing and assessment/understanding of the content and context of the stories as entertainment. The integrated story-lines are compressed in what seems like a very short school year. This may not be appropriate viewing for some.",1481932800,,1049,5.868421052631579

4519352,4,B00514HM0Q,"Very cute movie about children.  A young boy demonstrating that his parents wanted him to learn about rifles instead of ""cigarettes"" was realistic.  Unlike the medifrauds who injected thousands of residents of the criminally blighted state of ""Colorado"" with live diphtheria during the bonded debt aspect of their extortions so as to have a  multitude of cases of real lung disease to fraudulently attribute to ""tobacco smoking"", rifles were designed for, are exclusively used for, and do in fact kill many including the son of the inappropriately restrictive parents. The film was delightfully supportive of individuals thinking for themselves as distinct from the groupthink which classified them as ""misfits"".",1468368000,,712,5.513761467889908

4519354,3,B00514HM0Q,Saw this movie with two kids 12 and 8. Definitely not a Disney movie but one with a fun vibe and a lesson learned. Both kids enjoyed it.

4519359,4,B00514HM0Q,"I was expecting another generic coming of age movie and gave it a chance because the reviews were so great. Well no regrets after watching this film. The vibe was definitely not one that everyone would appreciate, if I am being totally honest, but for those who it speaks to, like myself, it's utterly relatable. This is definitely heartwarming, but not overly so. The characters in the film are strong and each has their own unique energy to bring to the story. There are some bittersweet and a few saddening moments, but that just makes it more realistic. For those of us who have ever felt out of place, whether it but childhood or as adults, this movie is worth a watch.",1459555200,,674,4.532786885245901
4519360,5,B00514HM0Q,"This was an excellent movie! That said it is not a movie for everyone; if you do not like movies like Napoleon dynamite, gentleman broncos or moonrise kingdom then you might not like this movie as it has a different humor and feel than most movies.
This is about a girl who thinks she desperately loves a boy (who is undeserving and shallow) he dumps her, and is changing who he is to be more popular. She on the other hand through experiences and finding good friends realizes there is more to life than a simple shallow boy, and that she is someone who can be herself and like herself. There are a few great lessons intertwined throughout.
There is a mature dying snippet and while not graphic it could be disturbing for a young viewer.
This is an underdog movie at its finest, it has humor that is subtle and a bit disarming. The storyline was very good and I quite enjoyed it! The actors do a great job.
This is one I will be watching again and again!",1457136000,,955,4.311111111111111

4519366,1,B00514HM0Q,"Left me with an ugly feeling after viewing. Lemon Lima presents interesting concepts to consider from a purely intellectual standpoint, yet it would be dangerous to view this movie without consciously recognizing that this is one man's perspective. The author distorts reality in his attempt to interpret it. I find his ideology faulty and I had difficulty finding virtues in his main character.

Could use a pick up in some pacing, but there is an honesty to some of the work that you don't often see in teen film. It's a simple, time honored premise, nicely done.

4519393,5,B00514HM0Q,"A very refreshing take on awkward school misfits and their rise to empowerment through embracing themselves and their unique strengths. There was a unifying visual artistic theme throughout this film that was very pleasing. It was accomplished through the choice of colors, cursive fonts, girly trappings, teen art and doodles. Alaskan nature sets with actors juxtaposed in unusual ways reveal a cinematographic talent that I loved. The whole look of this film is clean and all its own. The music was also a very pleasing component to this film, fitting and original.

The bulk of the film is fairly light in the way it deals with the characters angst. It does however take a dark turn in the way it portrays the tragic result of meddling overprotective parents of one of the misfits. Quite powerful and real.

I likely am not the demographic this indie film had in mind when made but I loved it. Highly recommended.",1419379200,7,916,4.828025477707007

4519395,5,B00514HM0Q,"One of my kids recommended this movie to me. I was hesitant because, even as a teen, I never really cared for the ""teen"" movie genre. This is not an exciting movie. It is an incredibly thoughtful one. It keeps you thinking long after you watched it and you'll find that you have little to complain about if you enjoy this type of movie. Even though quite thoughtful, this movie deftly incorporates humor. You will laugh a lot, you will cry, and in some instances you will be laughing and crying. Keep the kleenex's handy.

I found the movie to be well-written and the acting superb. It reflects a confusing stage of growth with such sensitive intelligence and yet without being morose. Yes, there are some flat characters that are a bit cliche, but they are used appropriately in moving the story line along and they are not portrayed in a completely vacuous or a completely reprehensible light. Even the flat characters get an intelligent and gentle touch and some are given the chance to grow. I love the way the writers developed the characters without imposing too much of an adult sensibility. Somehow they captured that hard to define space between childhood and adulthood.

We enjoyed the mother's character. She is not too intense, allows her daughter some space, tries to provide a different perspective when necessary (without being pushy), and has a sense of humor. I guess I can relate to her because my parents approached parenting the same way. They didn't live my life for me, but there was no doubt they were there for me.

Vanessa's (main character) father is never seen in the movie, but his mother keeps an open line of communication through letters. Though she is never seen, the grandmother actually plays a pivotal role in Vanessa's growth process.

I love magical realism in literature and movies. ""Dear Lemon Lima"" has just the right amount. I feel like every person's life has a little bit of magical realism in it if they are willing to see it. I feel like these are the events in our lives when we realize that there is an entire world beyond just the physical and that our value is somehow more tied up in the intangible that we normally don't acknowlege. In this way the movie makes a nod to the rich spiritual searching in the lives of teens, even those who've been overtaken by the commercialism of our current society.

I want to watch this movie again. But I will wait a while, because right now I want to savor the beauty of my surprising first encounter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is very little foul language in this movie. What a relief for my ears. In the winter games, one team calls themselves ""fubar"", but as far as I can remember the ""f"" word is never spoken, although it is blurred out in one scene.

One of the characters commits suicide. This is a very delicate issue and if you have a teen struggling with depression and suicide this might not be the movie for them. The script handles this in a very delicate way. I found it to be incredibly beautiful even though the Inuit beliefs of the after life differ from mine. There is no discussion of the value of human life and the need to try and draw on the strength of your community when suffering from depression or feeling like your life is of no value. I am fine with this but other parents may not be. You can always have a discussion with your child after the movie.

Note: I read a review that said it was not believable that the particular character who committed suicide would have done so. Sad to say at this age, it is hard to say who is a candidate for suicide. We never know what can push a kid into thinking their life isn't worth living. They of all people have fewer skills to deal with the blows that life sends, and they have a much harder time understanding and articulating how they feel. They also have a time being heard, because adults don't always take their struggles seriously. This is not a knock on adults, it is hard being a parent. We made it through, so we figure they will have the wherewithal to do the same thing. We need to take a step back and listen. (Talking to the choir).",1415404800,4,4484,4.990629183400268
4519396,4,B00514HM0Q,"I saw this movie categorized as a family comedy, which it is not. It is not funny at all. It is a very good film, but often sad and sometimes disturbing. I don't think most kids would like it. Parents should be aware that there is a suicide in the movie that should raise questions from kids. It gives a well balanced look at Vanessa's life and stays true to itself, never devolving into stereotype. I think the best audience for this is adults who like independent films, and serious, mature, older teens.",1415145600,,506,4.451612903225806

In truth, it is a feel good movie but not because everything is unicorns and bunnies. This movie is about coming of age and finding those life long friends that make life worth living.

Please note that this movie contains the very adult themes of belief and suicide. In an ideal world there would never be suicides but I don't think there are ,many people who haven't been touched by the topic of suicide. I appreciate that the writer and director didn't make it pretty or unrealistic. Nor did they pass over the very real grief that is left in the wake for those that loved the individual.

The world could use a lot more Vanessa's in it.",1514678400,,806,4.33112582781457
8452252,3,B00514HM0Q,"This movie was a little out there for me. For starters, the young girl is an atheist and assumes God hates her. That will leave a bad taste in the mouth of children learning about God or people wondering about Him. Second, the movie has a little boy kill himself. That is very disturbing considering all the deaths happening by that means this year (famous people). It kept your attention but it's not for young children. More for teenagers to adults. But even teenagers have to be careful because movies can leave impressions and this one wasn't the best given the circumstances of this world.

I get that this movie was meant to be harmless and for any viewer, but I (23yrs old) was left like ""whoa, the young kid committ's suicide over his parents being too protective and loving him a little too strong"". That is completely wrong for a movie to showcase. Also, the actors kept referring to a girl of a healthy weight as fat. The girl is very young and getting called fat by classmates and the family of the boy who dies. That is not good for girls who are weight conscious. Once again, the girl was of a healthy weight and the film is sending the wrong message. Lastly, the Native American theme wasn't showcased as they expected it to be. I mean, I am not full Native American, but some of the stuff was offensive.

 Watch this with caution and don't forget that this is simply a movie and nothing for the young viewers to take to heart. I say this from my younger experience, where I would watch a movie and think it was great and that it was how life was supposed to be. It was awful when I found out the movie was portrayed to make things more dramatic than reality is.

And to all the parents saying this is great for young children, you must be delusional.",1509840000,,1766,4.375
