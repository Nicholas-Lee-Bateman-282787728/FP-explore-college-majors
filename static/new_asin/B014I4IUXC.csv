7411552,5,B014I4IUXC,"Glad that SOMEONE finally released this series in its entirety.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's more than we were going to get from CBS themselves.  They really didn't do much to the first 3 seasons that they DID release.

Note that these are from broadcast video masters, not remastered film sources.  They are quite watchable.  I had no technical problems with my set (and I've watched them all), so perhaps the problems others have mentioned here have been addressed.

The only special features are a photo gallery and the 1980 RETURN OF FRANK CANNON TV movie.  It may just be nostalgia, but I find this series to be fun to watch.  I love it when Conrad turns into an obvious stunt double for fight scenes and then gets up out of breath!",1445385600,15,738,4.488721804511278
7411553,5,B014I4IUXC,always liked cannon great series,1444953600,3,32,5.6
7411554,5,B014I4IUXC,There are those that are not happy with the picture. Maybe its because I'm watching it on blu ray player but I find the picture clear. I am happy I went on and made the purchase of the complete set because obviously they were not going to put out the rest of the seasons.,1444521600,11,271,4.037037037037037

7411556,5,B014I4IUXC,I am super excited to finally get the Complete series on DVD! I understand about some of the negative feedback cause sure it could have been cleaned up better. But I have bought this series various times over the years on bootleg sites! If this is as good as it gets I'm very happy!,1444262400,2,282,4.2407407407407405
7411557,4,B014I4IUXC,"This review is to give readers/viewers an idea of what to expect in the new release of Cannon: The Complete Series.  If you are reading this review, you likely know that the show is a 5 star show all the way.  Great acting by William Conrad, of course, and the stable of guest stars that made the 60s and 70s of television such a Golden Age. You already know that the stories in Cannon are solid and worth revisiting.  The question is: what is this new set like?

The question has to be asked because CBS/Paramount already released seasons 1 and 2 of Cannon several years ago and then season 3 was released on print on demand discs, which does not always play on all devices.  I never bought season 3 due to poor Amazon reviews and I had hoped that someday someone would release the entire series.  My wish was granted.  However, it is a flawed release, for sure.  The bad news is that we get the same looking episodes as in the original releases.  I was praying that VEI would pay for the cost of remastering the series -and if you don't think it makes a difference in quality just look at season 1 of Barnaby Jones-  but it did not happen.  The look is the same as the original releases.  I went randomly through seasons 4 and 5 to check, and of the five-ten minutes I watched here and there it had the same faded look to it. It's very sad that this series was not treated better.  I realize that it has a limited audience but don't we of the limited audience desire the highest quality too?  Especially when you consider that you are paying over a hundred dollars for it.

One thing I noticed is that the audio seemed crisper.  The music and dialogue really popped.  Also, and this is strange to me: even though the colors were faded in long shots,such as street scenes, etc. it almost seemed to me that closeups of Conrad and the other sctors were more crisp, including the colors in the background.  It was strange and maybe someone would know why that is.  So, I am still excited to get the whole series and have it in a nice compact package.  If you are unwilling to spend the money to buy it for the seasons you do not own you can always contact VEI and see if they ever plan on releasing the final three seasons in single voulmes.  It is up to you.

One final concern.  In season five there is an episode called The Deadly Conspiracy, which stars Buddy Ebsen as Barnaby Jones.  This is part one of a two part story.  The second part was concluded on the Barnaby Jones series.  Unfortunately, that second epsiode from Barnaby is not offered here, so you would need to wait until the complete Barnaby Jones is released to see the entire story.  That's too bad as the complete Barnaby Jones is going at an even bigger price come November.  There you have it.  I hope this review will help some make decisions on this product before making the hefty purchase.",1443571200,111,2864,4.340866290018832

7411634,3,B014I4IUXC,"The shows are as good as ever when it comes to William Conrad, the plot and the co-stars.  I wonder what happened with the sound mixing, though.  When the volume is loud enough to hear the dialog clearly, the music is annoyingly loud.  Hearing is a subjective thing and one has to assume whoever did the mixing thought it sounded perfect to his ears and tastes.  My hearing is better than normal at all frequencies up to 12,000 Hz, so it's not a hearing deficit on my part.  I couldn't get the first disk to play anything beyond the initial logo information and music on my computer.  No matter what I did, it was impossible to select an episode.  I didn't try other disks.  I don't have this problem with other boxed sets.  It does play all right on a DVD player and looks fine on the large screen TV.  I thought it was interesting that there is a disclaimer at the start warning that things might not be as good as one would like because of the age of the series.  However, I have all the Star Trek episodes and there is no mismatch between the dialog volume and the music volume.  The original Star Trek began in 1966 while Cannon began in 1971.  I'll probably keep this, but hope it's done much better by someone else in the future.",1505520000,5,1236,4.298701298701299

7411637,5,B014I4IUXC,"Cannon was a TV show that ran for 5 seasons from 1971 to 1976. The star, William Conrad, played Frank Cannon, an ex-cop who became a private cop (detective) as Cannon would say. He often went at it alone but sometimes had help from law enforcement. He seems to have known a lot of people on various police forces. He had a reputation of being the best private detective in the business and highly sought after.

The show ran on average from 49 to 51 minutes, the Pilot episode ran for 1 hour & 37 minutes. The show was produced by Quinn Martin who had a long history (over 20 years) of making hits. It was only in the 5th season of the show that we heard the familiar voice stating that it was a Quinn Martin Production.

There were many guest starts on Cannon. Russell Johnson (the professor on Gilligans island) appeared on 2 episodes, and Tina Louise (Ginger on Gilligans Island) on 1 episode.  There were many other guest stars, some taking on recurring roles.

Frank Cannon drove different Lincoln Continentals during the show. For awhile it seemed like Frank, the Police and even the bad guys all drove Fords, but every once in a while wed see a Chevy or Mercedes. Frank had a car phone in the car. Growing up in the 60s and 70s this seemed like such a cool thing. With on TV in the house and no way to record shows back then, this was not the show that was watched most of the time.

The seasons had 24 episodes and each season is on 4 DVDs (an average run time of just under 6 hours per disk). Season 1 is on the inside cover on a pair of spindles (2 per spindle), Season 2 & 3 share the 1st page, Season 4 and the first half of Season 5 on the 2nd page and the second half of Season 5 on the inside back cover. This is the first time I have seen spindles used and all I can say is that its different. I removed the disks as I watched each season and then replaced all 4 after I finished watching the season. I suppose it was a cost saving measure to ship each season on 4 disks vs. 6 disks (i.e. a total savings of 10 disks). See the attached photos.

Personally, I found the show enjoyable to watch. Frank uses his wits and logic to solve cases. He knows hes on the heavy side and seems to make fun of it himself as do others in the show. He loves good food and good wine. He also knows how to defend himself and often seen using Karate and/or Judo on those attacking him as well as a gun (snub-nose 0.38 special). The show also gives us an insight in what life was like in the early 70s. The show was filmed in 4:3 and I watched it on a large screen CRT (tube) set that has a resolution of 480i. There were only 1 or 2 spots where there was some distortion in the last season that show up in 480i, (not sure what it would look like on a 1080p TV set), but for the most part it played well in SDTV format. We have a pair of 480i TVs in the house that we use to watch old shows.

There is a TV movie that came out in 1980 called The Return of Frank Cannon that I have to track down. It does not appear to be sold on Amazon or other sites. Its too bad it was not included in this release. There is another complete set sold here on Amazon that includes TV movie along with the series released on 31 disks (see:  https://www.amazon.com/Cannon-Complete-Collection-Episodes-Movies/dp/B014I4IUXC) but it sells for $49.99 as of this writing. To the best of my knowledge neither box set has been re-mastered. Cannon was shot in 35mm which could be made HD if someone took the time to do so. I suspect the demand is not there to do this yet. Plus the show was shot in mono and to make into passable 5.1 or 7.1 could be costly.",1504224000,10,3627,4.12022630834512

7411677,2,B014I4IUXC,"Please note that this rating is not for the TV show itself but only for the DVD set discussed below.

All potential purchasers of Cannon on DVD  should be aware that there are two VEI DVD sets of this show in circulation at the time of this review, the 31 disc set from 2015 and the 20 disc set from 2016 . The 2015 set has an internal case for each season comprising 6 or 7 discs with generally speaking 4 episodes per disc, and is the set which I thought I was purchasing.  What I received however, much to my regret, is the 20 disc 2016 set, the shortcomings of which I will discuss below. It is this set to which I am giving the 2 star rating, and I am probably being generous in doing so. Both sets have almost identical covers and I will never be sure whether I made a mistake when I ordered my set, or whether the cheaper inferior version was foisted upon me either accidentally or deliberately by the seller. But I could have sworn I was ordering the set with the 31 discs at the time! I should emphasize here that the seller in question was not Amazon, but rather a seller of new items on eBay. (Nevertheless I encountered an almost identical situation on Amazon in regard to the purchase of a Fugitive set where the description given by Amazon was not for the set pictured but for a superior quality set). For those ordering this set by mail at a future date who do not wish to fall into the same trap as I did, it may help to be aware that the 2015 31 disc set has ""ALL 122 EPISODES"" in the LOWER right hand corner of the outer case, whereas  the 2016 moves this to the UPPER right.

Anyway, to the 2016 20 disc set. This has 6 episodes per disc so obviously there is more compression going on. The case is one of the worst I have ever encountered. Unlike the separately housed seasons of the 2015 set ALL 20 DVDs of the 2016 set are in the one plastic case, arranged across 2 (yes - only 2) internal trays and the back and front of the case. It is not uncommon for DVD cases to have 2 spindles per tray so that discs overlap. This set goes one better. It has 2 spindles per trayside and 2 discs per spindle, so that you have a situation where 2 discs on top of each other overlap another 2 discs on top of each other on each side of the trays! Naturally in a situation like this discs are going to get knocked around and mine certainly were. There were also multiple fingerprints present giving the impression that some of the discs may have been repackaged by the manufacturer. I have barely gotten into watching the set and there are already playing glitches present even when there are no visibly obvious defects on the discs themselves. Unfortunately as I haven't seen them I cannot compare the image and sound quality to the transfers on the 2015 set (they may be the same)  but I can concur with the poor quality of the transfers on this set, although this may, as some reviewers have suggested, be due to the fact that the original source material has deteriorated with time. Finally although I have barely gotten into watching the whole series, this set does not appear to contain the 2nd TV movie The Return of Frank Cannon, but I could be wrong. In my perusal of the title episodes on the discs (yes - no booklet!) I have not seen it mentioned. Anyway I must head off one day and buy a new set of DVD cases to repackage the darn thing.",1496188800,14,3357,4.221183800623053
7411678,1,B014I4IUXC,"Liked this show when it was ""new"". As expected, the episodes look like an old TV show, no problem there. But the discs are crammed into one large case, and that's not normally a problem, but the plastic dvd case arrives broken so the case will not hold the discs. You either need to buy a number of new cases to store the discs or return the item for refund or replacement (may take several tries to get a good set). I know these are old episodes, and the world is moving toward streaming, but those of us buying discs want a case that holds the discs. A few more pennies on a good case would have avoided a lot of hassle.",1495152000,33,622,4.10655737704918

Then this set came along at the same price (a little less, actually) than the two remaining seasons so we bought it. The quality is fine (we don't have a big screen, though, so I can't speak to that). Each disc has 6 episodes, so if you hit play all, it runs a long time. The only annoying thing is the music that comes on after the last episode ends. It's really loud, but that's not enough to mark it down. The stories are wonderful. I swear this show just got better with each passing year. The acting is fantastic and the settings are interesting (though it's hilarious that everyone in small cities is portrayed with a southern accent, even if the town in question is  deep in southern, um, California. (That isn't unique to Cannon, though, it seems to be Hollywood code for scary non-urbanite.) This collection is excellent, and we are so glad to have it to enjoy again and again. I do have to add something about the packaging. The discs are tightly secured and stacked in pairs, which protects them from scratching during shipment, but, unfortunately, it is a little too hard to get them off their spindles.",1490832000,6,1189,4.47926267281106

My complaint is the quality of the DVD reproduction.  I'm in the second season now and have had three disks, across season 1 and 2, where one of the episodes pixelates and sound drops and the player slows to a crawl with re-reads.  I sent back my first set and replaced it so the issue isn't isolated.

7411832,4,B014I4IUXC,"Received the complete series in the last week. I purchased directly from VEI. It does seem prices vary when 1 compares Amazon, VEI's website and e-bay.  It's a really nicely produced set. Has solid packaging and the dvds play well and have easy to use menu(s).  As indicated, the picture quality is so so. The audio quality is excellent.  This show has never been remastered so it's similar to video quality from CBS disks or seeing it on classic tv.  I was reintroduced to the show when METV ran it on Sunday afternoons for several years.  The CBS disks for the first two seasons did a slightly better job of cleaning those small blemishes or specks that you see on old tv shows. It's not terrible but I see spots pop up for 2-3 seconds maybe once or twice per episode. It seemed CBS did remove many of these although they did not do a full remaster.

If I rated video quality, I would give a show like Hawaii 50 or Mannix that was fully remastered a 9, the CBS DVDs of Season 1: 7, and these a 6.5.

The show itself is excellent.  They have really good stories, excellent guest stars, and great music.  The music has a little bit of 1970s jazz style to it similar to Herb Albert or Chuck Mangionne if you remember the era.  The producers use a bunch of the great character actors that appeared in other CBS shows like Perry Mason, Twilight Zone, Hawaii 50, Mannix as well as the Fugitive (Quinn Martin production for ABC)

So far, I have been watching Season 3. It has tons of great episodes so just getting this season is definitely worth $30-$40 by its self.",1465689600,3,1562,4.370242214532872

7411851,5,B014I4IUXC,"Cannon Season One and Two were previously released in 2008 thru 2010 on pressed DVDs by CBS/Paramount. The first 2 seasons were released as 2 Volumes per season. Then in 2013 CBS/Paramount released season 3 in its entirety, however they put it on DVD-Rs instead of pressed DVDs. Pressed DVDs are supposed to last longer than DVD-Rs. Then CBS/Paramount did NOT release the final 2 seasons of Cannon. CBS/Paramount did not remaster Cannon. The video quality is like VHS, contrasty and sometimes there is a thin band of color on the left side of the screen. Then in 2015 VEI released Cannon as a box set with all 5 seasons including the pilot movie and the ""revival"" movie, ""The Return of Frank Cannon"". This VEI release is NOT remastered and is missing the episodic promos that were on the earlier CBS/Paramount releases. However ALL the DVDs are on pressed DVDs and are single sided and have color labels on them unlike the grey labels that CBS/Paramount used. Each season is in a  plastic  6 DVD case, except for season 5 which is a 7 DVD case, and all the cases fit in a cardboard slipcase. And it appears all the original 1970s music is retained and the episodes are NOT cut, they are complete and are around 50 minutes each. The extras are the 2 movies and a 7 minute slide show of scenes from the series set to the theme music. Cannon is different than the rest of the private eye shows, he is a loner with no regular supporting cast like the Rockford files and Mannix and he is fat, William Conrad frequently jokes about his weight. Cannon is a fast paced show with believable action in it. Cannon is a tough, but likeable guy. It's too bad VEI didn't remaster Cannon, the show deserves it, but at least they released the whole series uncut on colorful pressed DVDs. If you like classic TV with masculine private eyes and fast paced stories you should buy Cannon.",1459814400,72,1868,4.523668639053255
7411852,5,B014I4IUXC,"I am presently watching Season 5.  Even though the sound fluctuates from episode to episode and the colour may be a bit muted on some, it is a great show and I am personally very happy that I purchased the complete collection.",1459641600,6,226,4.380952380952381
7411853,4,B014I4IUXC,"I got a deal on this set purchasing it from an eBay auction. I already owned Seasons 1 - 3 and the movie The Return of Frank Cannon from earlier releases, so I only wanted Seasons 4 and 5 to complete the series.  I am happy to have the set but potential buyers need to be forewarned.  There are technical glitches on some of the discs that cannot be overcome.  If you are looking for perfection, you won't find it here.  For example, on Season 4, Disc 3, the first three episodes play just fine and run the full 49 to 50 minutes expected.  However, the fourth episode on the disc, The Prisoner, has a technical glitch in the disc writing about eight minutes in that causes about eight to nine minutes of the episode to be lost.  The episode plays through and it isn't a disc error, rather it is an error in the encoding of the episode data when written onto the disc.  The data is not there so the episode only runs about 42 minutes.  Similar issues happen on other discs as well to varying degrees, although this example I have detailed is one of the most glaring.  So, I recommend this set to a Cannon fan who wants to enjoy the nostalgia of seeing these old shows but who can live with the imperfections of the set.  If you are a perfectionist, you will be disappointed in the quality of a number of episodes in this set.",1459123200,12,1324,4.239043824701195

7411855,5,B014I4IUXC,"Maybe not the best color or picture on some of the episodes. I am really enjoying this. I had the first three season and was not too thrilled about having to buy all of them. But I wanted the whole shows so I did purchase it. I am very glad I did. My husband and I watched this show every week and it stands up to my memories of the show. The story lines are usually very good. The actors are some surprises , and a lot of the old actors I love. No swearing or nudity. I am very happy with this purchase. Oh yes, the sound is very good.",1458518400,3,536,3.8378378378378377
7411856,5,B014I4IUXC,""" Cannon "" belongs to my favorite crime shows. Approx 15 years ago it was presented in German television for the last time. But only sessions 1 and 2.  I don't know why but it is impossible to get it in Germany. Luckily I also own a Dvd player being suitable for regional code 1 and I will not have problems playing Dvd's from the United States.
It was a long searching but I am glad I could get the complete show now.",1457740800,3,418,4.036144578313253

7411864,4,B014I4IUXC,"4 stars for the series minus 1 for the bad copies. I know it is not VCI's fault they got the deal to release them and were given CBS video tape masters. The quality is just like when you watched them when on TV Land.
Many people are saying season 5 disc 6 has a problem my set was ok but season 4 disc 6 was missing and skipping. When they mass produce these things there are always problems that come up, this is the main issue I have against VCI they should have a better quality control operation.
I am very happy with VCI taking on the challenge for low demand older TV shows.
I wish someone can tell me how to get or replace defective discs. Thank you  very much.",1451001600,8,668,4.0606060606060606

Only one problem,  THEY NEED TO SELL THE DVD SEASONS INDIVIDUALLY!!!

7411869,4,B014I4IUXC,"Very pleased with this set!  Just got it earlier this week and can attest that video quality is pretty much the same as all the prior sets released--like watching them on old-tube TV set on a cart, perhaps a bit better, just as I used to watch them in the 70s. I applaud the VEI folks for having released a full set AND for having taken the time and effort to do outstanding Cannon-themed artwork on each disc, season box, and the opening/selection screen of each disc. Sweat stains were evident in preparing this set, despite not being $$ feasible to do a full remaster of the series (the only reason I gave it just 4 stars) .  If you're a Conrad fan like I am, and you loved this series, you will be pleased with this set.  Get set for a great time, 9:00pm your time, dim-lights, and watch with your favorite beverage in hand.",1445817600,17,828,4.294871794871795
