A young boy and a girl call for help, they are treed by a longhorn cow. [A long shot for a stunt double? Longhorn cattle can be as dangerous as a buffalo.] Has Rob grown up yet? Rob takes the girl home and is told about a barn dance. Rob takes Marge there. Three men arrive, one picks a fight with Rob, other men join in! Those three men arrive at Marges home to see her father. They make themselves at home there. Marge is introduced to Uncle Bill and her cousins. There is a conflict over manners. Rob plans to get engaged with Marge. Her father Joe asks Marge to tell Rob to stay away while his relatives are present.

Joe orders Rob away with his rifle! Can Rob help find his Dads missing cattle? Should he take his revolver? Not this time. Out on the range a man shoots Robs father when he finds his stolen cattle. Rob and the Sheriff visit Joes ranch. The Sheriff asks to borrow a rifle. Who used it today? Can the bullet from the victim be matched to the rifle? Marge gathers eggs from the baled hay in the barn. Then she and her brother ride away in their wagon. When the horses run away Rob catches the horses but the team separates from the wagon! The wagon crashes. Robs hired hands are fired by Bill, who borrows Robs wagon and supplies.

Marge and brother Bud tell Rob what really happened. Bill threatens Joe about informing the state of Kansas. Marge overhears her cousins talk. Can they stop her from talking? Bud relays a message from Rob, and is sent back with a request from Marge. Her relatives want to take Marge to town, but Rob arrives to get Marge first. One of them catches Rob but is knocked out. The Sheriffs posse gets him. Rob continues his pursuit of the other brother. There is a fight, the Sheriff arrives. There will be a happy ending for Marge and Rob now.

Overall this is a good story but the plot has problems. If they haven't been in contact for ten years how did Bill find Joe? The story of Robs maturing is a plus. The lack of shooting makes this unusual for this Western. Were they on a low budget? Bob Steele showed his athletic abilities. It is rare for George Hayes (from Buffalo NY) to play an outlaw.",1507852800,,2176,4.261501210653753
