Many more DVD that I want to get.t v today just doesn't have many shows I like.....J UST watch my DVDs. The purchase of Bonanza  vol one, was very much enjoyed, little Joe is just funny to sad to down right crazy.  Good old fashion western of  the good old days. Amazon is a very good place to make your purchase. You get the DVD when they say it will arrive, well packed. I will continue to buy DVDs from Amazon.",1418515200,2,559,4.254716981132075
