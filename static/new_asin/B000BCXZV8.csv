2413980,2,B000BCXZV8,"The video certainly has potential, however as someone that has been working out for over 10 years this tape is WAAY too easy. I barely feel a burn while doing the ab workouts, and they are entirely too short. Perhaps if they were three times as long and did all four back to back it would be a worthwhile workout. But I have much better ab tapes that kick my butt with 5 minute segment(notably The Firm abs and Tamilee Webb ab tapes). If you are an advanced exerciser I say pass on this one.",1163116800,4,491,4.178947368421053
2413981,5,B000BCXZV8,"At first I hated this DVD...I tried the cardio segment and I got quite frustrated with all the moves. However, I was determined to do it all and within 3 times of popping in the DVD, i started to get all the steps. Trust me- this dvd is great if you master the cardio- you'll improve your hand/ eye coordination, lose fat, and have fun. There are 4 five minute abs toning workouts also, which really give you a variety and tone your abs. If you are looking to tone your body you are supposed to do at least 30 minutes of cardio and 5 minutes of ab workouts each day, so this DVD is perfect!",1154649600,7,590,4.094827586206897
2413982,5,B000BCXZV8,"I just received my DVD this week and I absolutely love it! I've done the classic abs segment and the core segment and they are both great. I watched the other two segments and the exercises seem a bit more advanced as far as core strength and balance but the exercises themselves aren't impossible to do like some abs videos I've attempted.

I love Tracey York and I was excited about the cardio segment. She gives you a really good workout but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with ankle or knee problems.

The 12-minute all over fix is GREAT. I wasn't sure a 12-minute workout would be worth my time, but she has some great moves that really work.

I would definately recommend this DVD for anyone looking for a great abs and/or cardio workout. The 12-minute workout is also great, but I'd recommend the Shape Your Hips, Butt and Thighs workout if you're wanting a really good lower body workout.",1139356800,19,900,4.54320987654321
2413983,5,B000BCXZV8,"I love a good ab workout.  You can never have too many.  Because you need to do abs so often, variety is key for not getting bored.  This is a good workout to add to your collection.  Tracey York is a good instructor and she does another great job here.  She begins by alternating two minutes of toning with five minutes of cardio (always keeping your heart rate up). There is crunches, pilates, core-conditioning and ""dynamic movement"" (they're all short but tough).  Because your heart rate is up a lot and you are doing toning, that's the best way to burn the fat and tone together which is more effective in the long run.  This workout is very well choreographed which makes it fun.  Again, you need dumbells here too.  The one problem I have with this, which you'll need to think about too, is that you may already have this because it's a re-release of Shape Your Abs from last year.  The cover has changed in a ploy to sell more copies.  I like this cover best though so I'm going to sell my original copy.  Just don't buy this dvd if you already have last years copy.",1135468800,35,1075,4.346733668341709
2413984,4,B000BCXZV8,"Good workout, I really like that is has different sections, like Classic, Pilates, Core, Dynamic and I learned several new abs routines. This is far from the usual crunches.",1208563200,,173,5.0
2413985,5,B000BCXZV8,"I love this video!  It's one of the first Shape videos I purchased and it's still on my list of favorites.  I love the cardio workout - 35 minutes including a warm up, 4 circuits, and a cool down.  The cardio portion of the circuits contains fun and unique moves, not too athletic and not too dancy.  The toning sections are brief, but combine an upper and lower body exercise to maximize this time.  There are also 4 5minute ab routines on the video.  None of them are extremely tough, but most have unique moves so the segments are interesting and different from standard crunches (well, except the segment called ""classic abs"").  I'm never sore the next day, so it's not for those looking for an ab blaster.  All in all though the video is fun and a good workout.  Plus the instructor, Tracy York, is great!",1202688000,2,810,4.45578231292517
2413986,4,B000BCXZV8,"I paired this workout with Shape your Butt, Hips, & Thighs. I follow the workout as recommended on the insert inside the DVD box. I've been doing the workouts for 2 weeks. It's fun! I've lost 5 pounds so far & feel more confident. I love the 12 minute workout too for days I don't have time to do the whole workout.",1201910400,,315,4.096774193548387
2413987,3,B000BCXZV8,I'm not the most coordinated person out there so the dance portion was a bit for me. The ab workouts for a bit short for me as well.,1200960000,,132,3.75
2413988,3,B000BCXZV8,"The Fat Burn Workoutis not for the average person this is a extremly high paced difficult to follow instructor. I recommend it only if you are ready to step it up in a big way. Absolutly no classic aerobic moves are used and I find the instructors expecting you to know the names they call there moves before hand, which throws you off and makes you want to give up. But it is good if you are extremly bored with the everyday aerobics DVD's. Although the abs workouts aren't that hard to follow but I mean how can you mess that up anyway right!",1196208000,3,544,4.240384615384615
2413989,5,B000BCXZV8,"It's rare to find a video like this where you like every single exercise. I'm an avid long time exerciser,who now works out in the am (5am, groan!)on weekdays when I'm less tired. This is a nice one to add 5-20 minutes of abs on to the end of an aerobic workout. It's broke out into 5 minute segments of classic, pilates, core, and dynamic. The only strange thing is the 1st and third one they wear shoes so you have to pick them out of order. I saw a difference right away and the more you do them the better you are at them. I'm telling you you'll like every move.",1192492800,5,566,4.0625
2413990,3,B000BCXZV8,"These workouts are good for easy days, or for beginners. Even doing all of them in succession does not wear me out. I do like the workouts and the DVD is professionally produced. It's just not an intense enough routine for my level of current fitness.

Recommended for the casual exerciser.",1191283200,4,290,4.686274509803922
2413991,5,B000BCXZV8,"Core strength is the focus of ""Shape Your Abs."" With four routines you can either do all the exercises in one session or focus on a classic, Pilates-based, core or dynamic routine. The menu allows you to skip over the cardio routine if you just want to focus on your abs after doing other cardio exercises or walking.

The classic routine focuses on tried-and-true exercises like sit-ups. Tracy York makes sure you are focusing all your attention on the muscles that count. Her encouraging style and a jazzy soundtrack keeps you moving through the exercises quickly.

The Pilates-based segment is another floor routine with recognizable techniques. The Hundred, Double-Leg Stretch, Crisscross and Double-Leg Lower Lift all make their appearance. The precision and control needed to complete the routine helps to flatten the midsection.

In the core segment the abs are targeted from a variety of angles and positions. It starts with a Pilates-inspired pre-roll-up combined with creative side stretches. Plank position follows with a move the feels more like running. This move tests your ab strength and takes you to your outer limits of endurance. You can feel the exercises working as you develop long lean ab muscles.

The final dynamic routine helps to train the torso to remain completely still while you move your arms and legs. You are on your back for all the exercise and yet this is the most creative segment with unique exercises to help you see results fast.

All the routines are fun and Tracy York makes sure you are never bored by keeping the routines creative and core intensive.

2413992,5,B000BCXZV8,"I love this DVD!  I've been working out for years, so at first I thought this would be too easy.  BUT if you do the exercises correctly and don't cheat, you can really feel the burn.  My husband was watching me do the exercises and mentioned that it looked really easy, so I made him do them with me....not as easy as they looked!",1180483200,5,330,4.125
2413993,5,B000BCXZV8,"This is a great abs video.  It is a four part ( five minute per section)  that includes classical abs, pilates inspired abs, core strengthen and dynamic abs.  The instructor points out the correct way to do each exercise to get the best results. Before this video, I was doing crunches the wrong way.  I did not know what to expect from the video, but I enjoy the workout. The video also includes a 35-minute cardio workout, which I bypass and go directly to the ab workout.",1171065600,9,474,4.413793103448276
8085199,5,B000BCXZV8,"I love this video! I decided to start working out again, and discovered that this video was still packed. I almost bought it off of here, but yesterday my husband got it out of the garage for me. I originally bought it at TJ Maxx for 4.99. I like the workout because it is low impact, and you see results in about 2 weeks. You can do the short in between workouts with or without the weights. I didn't use any in the beginning. The 4 five minute ab videos are a plus. I usually do those on a separate day than the workout. I watched the bonus 12 minute weight-lifting, and looks like it is just as effective. My main concern was/are my abs so I probably won't do this part of the video, this time around either. I think that it's a great value for the price. You get a variety of workouts. I have other workout videos but I have found that this one is more effective. I highly recommend this workout dvd.",1437350400,,904,4.142045454545454
8085200,5,B000BCXZV8,"I've only used the 4- 5 minute ab routines on this and I love them. Quick, precise and effective I try to do them 4 times a week. What's 20 minutes, anyway? At least a good 10 minutes is dedicated to lower abdominals between the ""Pilates based"" set and the ""Dynamic"" set. The ""Core"" set is great for lower back and posture.",1386201600,,323,4.225806451612903
8085201,5,B000BCXZV8,"This is kind of an old video by now, but we still use and love the workout. There are various ones you can choose from including just a quick one if you are in a hurry. All in all I am really happy with this purchase and bought one for each of my daughters!",1376265600,,257,3.7777777777777777

8085203,5,B000BCXZV8,"Totally LOVE this workout video! I like that each segment is nice a short, so I can customize my workout depending on how much time I have! It REALLY, really, REALY works all ab groups! A must-have for someone who wants to work on their abs!",1322006400,,241,4.260869565217392
8085204,4,B000BCXZV8,"I'm not completely out of shape, but not as good as I have been, but I like this video.  The cardio part kicked my butt, and although it's a little difficult to keep up with the first couple of times, once you get the hang of it, you can tell it's burning calories!  The ab workout wasn't very intense, but once you learn what moves to do, just do them over and over and that will work.  Overall I really liked this video and I'll continue to use it!",1267488000,,450,4.033707865168539

8085206,1,B000BCXZV8,"The four ab workouts are not intense enough and the moves would sometimes hurt my neck! The cardio segment was absolutely ridiculous. I couldn't follow along mainly because they did too many ""dance"" moves and it was too boring and not increasing my heart rate. Do nottt buy this!",1228608000,2,279,4.714285714285714
8085207,1,B000BCXZV8,"This video is not very challenging.  I did all 4 of the abs workouts at once and I really couldn't even tell that I did anything.  My abs weren't sore and I wasn't tired at all.  And I just had a baby 4 months ago, so it's not like I am in that great of shape.  I was very disappointed in this workout video.",1218499200,3,308,3.765625
8085208,3,B000BCXZV8,"Overall the workout was okay. It has a good aerobic workout, and the ab workouts target the abs in different ways. However, I feel decieved by Shape because the cover to this dvd looks new, but it is an older workout. If you can deal with an older workout then this is a good workout, but if you want something new then you may want to keep looking.",1215993600,,349,4.147058823529412
