8346851,1,B001W0Z2M8,This looks like a high school student filmed it. The acting is TERRIBLE.  Its actually good if you need an example of what not to do.  Its about suicide and I think anyone who has watched it will consider killing themselves after 10 minutes of the film.,1434931200,,253,4.361702127659575
8346852,1,B001W0Z2M8,I think this is somebody's college project from the early 90's. I feel like I've been had and I want my money back.,1377561600,,115,4.043478260869565

8346854,5,B001W0Z2M8,"This movie was fantastic. Unlike any I have ever seen before. I only wish it was longer, I wished it never would have ended. Everyone daydreams about their true love, about being saved by their knight in shining armor, about their dream life and happiness. Victoria becomes so entangled in her fantasies that she loses much of her ability to distinguish them from reality.
  The movie is fantastically crafted, transitioning from one scene to the next seamlessly. The effects really draw you in and make you feel like you are part of her dream. You feel her sadness, her yearning, and her precious few moments of bliss as if they were your own. This is one that you will watch again and again. There really are no words to describe how amazing of an experience watching this movie was.",1266451200,3,785,4.640287769784172
