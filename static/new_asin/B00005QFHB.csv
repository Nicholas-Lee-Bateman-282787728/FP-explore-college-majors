7950574,1,B00005QFHB,I think Shannon is a good actress and i've seen all her lifetime movies. My favorite show is BH 90210. Well this is the worst movie I ever seen. The storyline was bogus and the acting by her and Antonio was horrible Would not watch it again and I'm sorry I bought this movie.,1259798400,3,275,4.111111111111111
7950575,3,B00005QFHB,"I saw the movie ""Jailbreakers"" online....one segment at a time.  When I found a great deal on it, I bought it!  I'm THE number ONE fan of Antonio Sabato Jr.  I thought his acting in this movie was some of his best.  I don't care for Shannen Doherty.....would have liked to see someone else play her part.  I think Antonio did a great job.  I have seen some movies, he wasn't as good in.  I would recommend it for his fans & others.  I didn't like the ending, but can't please everyone!",1243382400,,485,4.195652173913044
7950576,3,B00005QFHB,"Antonio breaks out of jail and takes girlfriend Shannen on the run from the police and Shannen's family with him. The acting is flawless, and the film has some exciting moments, and I couldn't predict the ending. So why don't I give the film 5 stars? Well I feel the plot drags in parts so I don't think you can justify the price it's at now. Only buy if your a big fan of the actors or the price comes down.",1002931200,14,408,4.049382716049383
