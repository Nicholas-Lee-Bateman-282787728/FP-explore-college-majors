8451649,2,B0050Q9A7I,"I teach reflexology, so I have purchased most of the DVDs on the topic. Sorry to say this one is a major disappointment.  There is almost no actual information about reflexology imparted herein via the audio, and the camera angles do not show what the therapists are doing very well.  The music background is nice, and the cover is beautiful, but I don't recommend folks buy the DVD.",1351900800,,383,4.617647058823529
