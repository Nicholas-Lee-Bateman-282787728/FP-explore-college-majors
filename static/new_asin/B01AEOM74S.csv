7599235,5,B01AEOM74S,"I've been waiting quite some time for this documentary to be released, and it was definitely was worth the wait. The film really hones in on the cultural norms and conventions regarding masculinity in the U.S., and how our American society sees it, views it, and witnesses the detrimental consequences of proliferating such ideas. The film also acts as a great spring board to branch out to other topics for discussion, such as how we see the LGBT community, feminism, etc--the dialogue definitely continues!",1457568000,3,508,5.059523809523809

7599237,5,B01AEOM74S,"The Mask You Live In is a documentary that explores societal expectations of men by following boys and young men as they struggle to stay true to themselves while dealing with Americas narrow definition of masculinity. With constant pressure from the media, peer groups and even adults in their lives, the subjects in the film confront messages encouraging them to disconnect from their emotions, devalue authentic friendships, objectify women, and resolve conflicts through violence. These stereotyping influences interconnect with race, class, and circumstance, creating a confusing labyrinth of identity issues boys and young men must navigate to become real men.  Experts in neuroscience, psychology, sociology, sports, education, and media provide empirical evidence of this boy crisis and tactics to combat it.

The movie highlights the implications of language associated with maleness (be a man or man up), examines stereotypes of athletic and financial success, and supports the points it makes with TV and film clips and numerous statistics flashed on screen (although without attribution).  Other factors  drinking, mass shootings, homophobia, depression, bullying, crime, video games, porn and campus sexual assault  are addressed, and several boys and grown men share anecdotes about their fathers and upbringing.

The discussions are frank and montage images are often graphic. There is strong language, particularly the slurs boys and men use to disparage one anothers masculinity.

While not soft-pedaling the darker moments, director Jennifer Siebel Newsom gives the documentary a hopeful outlook. If kids can be raised to reject outdated, limiting roles, society in general can help boys develop more enlightened, healthier identities as men.

There are no bonus features on the unrated widescreen DVD release.",1457136000,6,1828,5.719557195571956

7599241,5,B01AEOM74S,"Wow. What a phenomenal film to watch with the boys and men in your lives. I had tears streaming down my face even as a female, weeping for the collective damage our culture has inflicted on young boys and men not necessarily  by trying to make them tougher sooner but mostly in crippling the emotional bonds and connections between fathers and sons and men amongst each other...
My 4 year old boy popped in to watch with me for a while and it started a wonderful conversation about what it means to be a man and be tough ...(his dad is a Cowboy if that tells you anything). As a mother I try to buffer some of the typical conditioning this rural tough-guy culture instills in its boys even at a young age, and I try to be the counter weight by being his soft place to fall where he can openly talk and be vulnerable. This  movie gave me some great perspectives on constructively dealing with these issues. It is a fine line we walk as parents while we try to make our kids immune to bullies in school on the one hand, but also instill and model enough heart an empathy to not become the bullies themselves. This shed more light on such an important issue. What a wonderful subject to make a movie about and a great step in the right direction!",1515196800,5,1243,4.285106382978723

I told him about this film and later that evening he brought over the iPad and suggested we watch it.  The film moved him as well, and we discussed it into the wee hours.

7599305,5,B01AEOM74S,"As a mother of three boys and a pediatric nurse, I have always been amazed at the narrow definition our society has on ""masculinity"". We start at a early age telling boys to ""be strong"", ""be tough"" , ""don't cry"" and then condemn them later in life, for not being empathetic and sympathetic men and spouses. Telling our young men and boys that they are not allowed to express their feelings is why we have higher numbers boy vs. girl cases of mental illness, completed suicides, juvenile incarcerations, drug and alcohol abuse. Boys are falling behind in schools and are achieving much lower academic success rates at all  levels- elementary, middle, high school, college and graduate programs.

7599307,1,B01AEOM74S,"This is an indoctrination into a man-hating ideology by extreme theorists. It claims that boys and men are responsible for domestic violence and the woman has no responsibility.

The observations of masculinity are made by women with a one sided bad stereotypes that lead to false conclusions. This movie is dehumanizing to boys and men and dangerous for women. This is a toxic, feminist college level masculine studies curriculum. It preaches toxic masculinity.

To be technical, this is about a perceived need, not a felt need. Thanks to these women for condescending to us and letting us know what we need; listening would have been better.

7599333,5,B01AEOM74S,"Stellar synthesis of the national epidemic we in America experience with regard to our caricatures of sexual identity.  Although this film was produced by women, there was hardly a woman in it . . . this is about men and boys and the mask they do live in.  It was a choice of the producers to omit or minimize the role that women often play in contributing to masculine hyperbole.  Women need to admit that.  But giving men the responsibility to recognize and re-engineer the part that fathers and peers play in formatting the male image their boys grow into is indeed a worthy project.

""The Mask You Live In"" should be watched by fathers and sons together, and frankly, made a requirement in high school health classes . . . for both sexes, but viewed separately.  For there is a special fellowship that develops when boys and men can share this together.  It wouldn't hurt moms to take a look, as well!",1467590400,,905,4.515337423312883

7599336,1,B01AEOM74S,"This film doesn't help boys, it hurts them.  It's a film about how being a boy is unnatural (only a means to not be feminine), shows little boys playing and calls that a problem, views all boys as potential criminals, and only shows fathers in a negative light.  In this film, all things male are bad, and all bad things are male, and women are not part of any of societal problems, just victims.  It's full of inaccuracies (such as flat out lying about the scientific consensus about video games and real life violence) and loaded with bad generalizations about men and boys.

To people that say all everyone should watch this, or that it should be shown in schools:  you would seriously show a hate film in school?  This is an anti-male video, heck it even calls boys bad and unnatural, and we're supposed to show that to little kids?  Have you thought about the flip-side of this, if a film made by women-hating men portraying women and girls in only a bad light, calling femininity a problem, and saying that little girls need to act like boys, all under the guise of 'helping' girls?  Could you imagine that horrific film getting praise, and then to have people on the internet wanting to have little girls watch that crap?  If you haven't thought about that then you need to re-think your positive stance on this film.

Aside from hatefulness, it also has bad practical advise.  It says that boys being taught to repress emotions is bad, that they should just let their feelings out at all times.  That's not good advice for boys or girls, people need to know when to stow their emotions, and it's especially bad for young boys because if they cry others will make fun of them (including girls) or they will get beat up. And when I was a kid girls didn't find crying boys attractive, and I doubt that's changed (but that must be all boys' fault, at the will of the evil ""patriarchy"" that they are card-carrying members of,.. right, feminists...?)

What about not masking emotions in adulthood?  Could you imagine a doctor freak out and cry when seeing an injured patient (and then need to retreat to their ""safe space""), or a lawyer crying when a trial is going badly, or a person crying during a business deal due to their work being criticized, or even a grocery clerk getting emotional about their divorce when you need them to just ring up your items so you can leave?  How often do those people get promoted, or even keep their jobs?  In the real-world (outside of liberal-arts universities) you can't cry all the time or get short with people who make you angry, you have to pull yourself together.  Both boys and girls should be taught how to suppress emotion when necessary, because to go far in the professional world (or even to flip burgers or bag groceries) you can't constantly show emotions.

To teach people that it's o.k. to be emotional all the time makes them less competitive in the real world and reduces the quality and timeliness of goods and services, and is therefore harmful to everyone.  It's not about masculinity or femininity or sexism.",1466553600,6,3071,4.601834862385321

This is an eminently important topic and it's presented very well. My students
were captivated while watching it and it led to endless interesting and useful
discourse.

My one gripe is that it was a bit long (2 hours!) and dragged a bit as some points.
**Also, there is VERY strong language-- even shocking-- so be sure to watch it yourself
before showing it to students and then act accordingly to make sure you don't get
yourself in trouble.",1466467200,,518,4.51063829787234
7599338,2,B01AEOM74S,"Good documentary if you've made up your mind beforehand that masculinity itself is somehow damaged and needs fixing. The actual stories of troubled young men all revolve around abusive or absent fathers, but this isn't noted by any of the talking heads in the film. We ARE told (by female ""experts"") that gender behavior is a social construct, and that masculinity is ""not organic"" (whatever that means) but merely the negation of feminine values. Clearly, the solution is to be more like women.

The last half hour of the film is a hodgepodge of less-than-authoritative statistics, a vague indictment of video games and pornography as contributing toward a culture of abuse of women, mixed with clips of college men behaving like idiots (but no college women behaving like idiots), and sprinkled all over with ""femspeak""- hypermasculinity, rape culture, privilege- you get the idea.",1465689600,12,883,5.174825174825175

What makes me the most angry is that much of what they show in this film is true--true stories, true feelings, etc--but then it offers explanations and solutions that are draped in feminist propaganda. I'm sorry, but sex is NOT a social construct! Pink and blue wallpaper and types of toys do not change our chromosomes, so please never utter the LIE that sex is a ""social construct"" ever again! I'm sorry, but flat out lying really pisses me off... it's not only dishonest, but it's harmful! It is true that boys and men are suffering inside, they are scared, they are in pain, and that is the good part of this documentary.

And continue to educate yourselves and do research afterwards. Once America as a whole wakes up and sees how damaging toxic masculinity is, and we learn to appreciate feminine and masculine people as they are, without imposing ridiculous expectations on them, perhaps we can bring about positive change for the coming generations.",1461542400,,629,5.116504854368932
7599354,1,B01AEOM74S,"A hate film. It pretends to be on the side of men while making them out to be rapists and murderers. It may have one or two valid points, but they're buried under a heap of buzzwords, questionable and sometimes false statistics, and intentionally misleading framing. This is a movie about how 'society makes men rape and kill'. It offers no solutions, it doesn't touch on female perpetrators or male rape/domestic abuse victims even once, and it makes masculinity seem toxic. It implies that men are the sole cause for female issues as well as male issues (And of course, women are only mentioned positively in this film).

Awareness is the beginning of change, but the desire to change and the courage to make the needed changes are up to the choices we as individuals make in our own lives. I would encourage anyone who cares about the future of our young people, our country and our world to watch this documentary and then ask themselves, ""What can I do to help us heal the wounds that make us either victims or perpetrators of violent crimes?""

8747187,4,B01AEOM74S,"This movie has a valuable message about men being raised to be over-masculine instead of being balanced mentally and emotionally.

That being said, there is also a tremendous liberal agenda to completely blame only society, media, and pornography. While those things can impact young minds- there was hardly any emphasis on the degeneration of a loving, supportive family structure. Family is the most impressionable on young children's minds and much of the poor activity that troubled children engage in at too young of an age, is because of parents struggling with awareness of their own children's behavior, struggling with resources, or struggling with their own issues. It's a sad cycle, but we must not completely blame general terms. A young boy who has a loving and respectful example of how a man is supposed to treat other men and women by the example of his own parents, is going to have a more realistic rational idea of what's appropriate and what's not, when they are exposed to the outside world.

Let's not undermine society's need to place more priority and importance on family, no matter what that family may look like. Family ultimately is where we learn how to treat everyone else. Media just pulls the trigger, if that family structure is not cared for.",1523923200,,1276,4.930232558139535
