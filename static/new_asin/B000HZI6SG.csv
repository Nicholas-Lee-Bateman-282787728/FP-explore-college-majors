8142606,5,B000HZI6SG,"A first in the field of independent comic book based film productions, Gold Digger has been a long-running adventure/fantasy title from Antarctic Press created by Fred Perry, who also took up the role of main animator under this 3-episode OVA. Based on the original short comic story that ran in Mangazine(and then eventually it's own one-shot), The Time Raft acts as an introduction to the main characters, super-intelligent archaeologist Gina Diggers, and Brittany, her adopted were-cheetah sister. The duo trot the globe for treasure and lost civilizations. Brittany gets by with her enhanced strength, speed, and healing, while Gina contributes her intellect, and a hyperspace toy chest filled with groovy gadgets.

The two heroines are looking around the British countryside searching for the ancient relic known as the Time Raft created by Merlin. Upon first entering the ruins of where they believe the relic is, the Diggers sisters are attacked by panther-like golems, and then accosted by a pair of warrior elves. Gina and Brittany awake to find their host, a menacing-looking dragon calling himself Swiftwing, who claims to be the protector of the Time Raft left to him by Merlin, but needs their help to figure out how to actual activate the device which allows its user to manipulate and travel through time. Gina initially agrees, but learns from the elves that the dragon is really Dreadwing, an evil dragon who conquered numerous kingdoms in the past, and hopes to use the rafts capabilities to plunder throughout time. Gina rigs the raft to open up a wormhole ripping the flesh off of Dreadwing, leaving the Diggers with Dreadwing's horde of gold to spend.

The OVA is mostly faithful to the original story, although some fight scenes were strung out for time, as well as some story elements which in the OVA elude to future events in the comic. The three episodes were first done about 2-3 years apart as Fred Perry did all the main production of the animation, which was mostly all done in traditional style with only some CGI. There was eventually a collected edition titled ""The Movie"", although this version has some different voice actors used in the first episodes, as well as mostly redone action sequences which were a vast improvement from the initial production. All 3 OVAs are still available individually on DVD, as well as the collected movie which is the better buy as it more convenient with a higher production value for the complete package. Most of the animation is considerably remarkable considering it was an in-house production, the only main draw back is some of the voice acting and lip-syncing. The Gold Digger comic series itself is a sprawling epic that has stretched for over 25 years, so it is slightly hard to get into sometimes, but over the last few years it has become more accessible by channeling into self-contained short arcs that don't dwell too hard on past plots. Surely worth looking into for fans of American-styled anime, or otaku and gamers in general!",1504915200,,3013,4.964356435643564
