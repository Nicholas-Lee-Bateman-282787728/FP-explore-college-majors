2602302,5,B000G8NVPW,"This math tutor DVD offers a ""no frills"" approach. It focuses on how to work problems which is exactly what most students need to improve in school. It covers strictly the basic mechanics of how to work math problems correctly. It doesn't get into the concepts. I am particularly impressed with how the instruction is paced - not too fast and not too slow. One recommendation: students should work the problems along with the instructor on the DVD and not just sit and watch.",1164326400,29,475,4.666666666666667
2602303,2,B000G8NVPW,"I bought this CD because my 2nd grader is quite bright and I wanted to teach him properly the concepts from advanced grades. I felt it would be more economical than going to an math enrichment company. The concept of this CD is very good. There is a ""teacher"" who goes through different math concepts. The only problem is his personal speaking style is quite annoying. First off he ends each sentence with ""you know"" and in addition the volume is extemely low. He goes through each problem very slowly so for a bright child like my 7 year old he lost his interest quickly. This CD would be great for a slow learner if this could keep his attention I would be surprised.

Quite pricey too!",1163030400,3,688,4.417322834645669
2602304,5,B000G8NVPW,"I don't understand the reviewers comments below as this is a simply wonderful product that has helped my children greatly.  The problems are worked out step by step and in the end my children have been able to work problems out faster and wither less chance for errors.

I am puzzled by the comment by the reviewer below says ""...we put the 1 above the 2 is because it is equal to one ten and every ten goes in the tens column..."".  This is true in the problem stated (23+7)...but for 230+70 this is not the reason that you put a '1' above the '2'.  Many many times I have seen teachers try to explain the 'reasons' why you carry numbers when adding and borrowing in subtractions and 99% of the time my kids get lost in all of the explanations of what is going on.  I much prefer this approach of this DVD which is to stop talking about it and teach the math skills by working problems .  I would suggest that any viewer continue to watch this content and not simply turn it off after one lesson as it is like riding a bike - you need practice.  I suppose that everyone has a different tase with respect to how to teach your kids math...for me this one is fantastic.",1155427200,22,1166,4.201793721973094

We have struggled in homework for so long that I have been frustrated at math.  We both sit and watch, the instuctor is very easy to understand and works out the problems completely while demonstrating.  We try to even finish the problems to see if we have correct answers.

2602329,5,B000G8NVPW,"This is a pretty straight-forward DVD.  Teaches math, gives examples, and the flow is very conversational, but to the point.  The instructor seems to have a pretty good grasp on teaching the specified age group.  All categories are broken down, so if you don't want to ""play all"", you can easily pick what section is needed.  One of the things I appreciate is the range of 1st - 7th grade.  If the 7yo has questions about math that hasn't been taught yet, the DVD is a perfect reference to get a good intro to the subject, rather than waiting another half year to learn it in class.  No ""bells and whistles"", no extra graphics.  Just a guy and a white board, explaining math problems.  For some reason, it still captivates the 7yo, and has been a requested reference for learning a new skill, or wanting to see more examples of the same skill.  A good, solid purchase.",1353888000,3,868,4.477707006369426

2602334,5,B000G8NVPW,"I went to college 25 yrs after high school & all but failed math & was pushed through school.

This gave me a solid foundation along with pre algebra DVD's I needed for the Accuplacer Exam. Before I watched these DVD's I got a 30 on the math. After watching these videos my score jumped up to around 70 and that was with mediocre effort.

Math Tutor DVD's are a must for every person learning any math from toddler counting up to Calculus. They even have DVD's on Physics, Chemistry, Statistics & Engineering Circuits. Go to their website & see examples of videos & package deals. They'd make great college graduation gifts.",1337040000,2,624,4.5625
2602335,5,B000G8NVPW,Math is my worst subject and this DVD brought me up to speed. I also bought the advance disc and work sheets. Some of it is remedial but I needed it and the discs worked!,1336348800,,170,3.8857142857142857
2602336,5,B000G8NVPW,"I am 44 years old and I'm having to go back to school to pass some calculus classes to basically keep my defense engineering job (the government is really getting strict and demanding on the computer scientists and engineers it will hire).  The big problem is I never went beyond College Algebra 1 and 2, and that was over 10 years ago, and due to lack of use, I've pretty much forgot it all again.  Back in high school, I passed standard algebra with fairly average grades at best, and was never exposed to trig at all.  So you can color me desperate for a ""crash course"" solution to basically getting not only calculus in my head so I can pass a few classes to keep my job, but also provide a total review of even some basic math skills I've forgotten.  I have forgotten pretty much all of algebra as well due to lack of use, and I have never been exposed to trig, a prerequisite of learning Calculus.

In short, I basically have to learn it ALL.  And FAST.

I  bought a few of these DVDs (featuring Jason Gibson) because of all the high reviews on Amazon.  WOW!  Worth every penny.  The first disc I popped in was the 1st-7th Grade Math DVD.  Jason Gibson's teaching style alone actually attracted my kids into the TV room.  All 3 of them (aged 6 to 14) all eventually wound up sitting next to me and watching the DVD with me!  It immediately solved several different areas that my kids were struggling with that I didn't even know they were having problems with (Egad, bad Dad!).  I was impressed both by the way Jason Gibson instructs (my kids like him, which says it all) and the way he repeats each lesson multiple times to make sure you ""get it"" before moving on to the next lesson/topic.  TOTALLY perfect for me, because I really need my hand held like a little kid as I crash my way from basic mathematics up through algebra, trig, and calc.  Embarrassing to admit all of this, but hey, math is really tough for most of us, and that's if we didn't forget it altogether since high school or college.

I do not have thousands and thousands of dollars in my pocket for prerequisite/catch-up pre-calc college courses or personal tutors in prep for my calculus classes.  I'm lucky to get a tax return.  What I DID do, however, especially after seeing the immediate results with my kids, is I bought the whole entire ""Math Tutor"" DVD set (making sure Jason Gibson is the instructor), I think I paid about $250-300 here on Amazon for all of them combined.  They are now a large ""Math Tutor Library"" sitting in my TV room that both myself and the kids can access at any time for any cramming or homework assistance we may need.

This DVD set is a total jackpot, exactly what I needed, and also acts as the perfect ""good grade insurance"" for my kids.  As a Dad, I feel I've helped my kids with their homework in the best possible way I possibly could have - I have basically brought into my home a friendly, permanent, personal, likeable, 24/7-available, Ph. D-level Math Tutor of the highest caliber for my kids who covers nearly every single topic of mathematics that my kids will experience in their studies and in real life.  This includes college-level instruction.

I could not be any happier with this purchase, so much so that I bought ALL of these Math Tutor DVDs just so I could have the entire set and cover every base no matter what classes my or any of my kids will ever take.

Looking forward to coming back in a year or so after I take my own classes to post the results of using these DVDs to basically save my butt, job, and family's well-being).  I have already been thoroughly enjoying the wonderful results they have produced in my kids' math grades at school, so buy with confidence.  These DVDs are excellent, both in ""damage control"" for bad grades and ""good grade insurance"" for you or your kids.",1330992000,27,3821,4.427753934191703
2602337,5,B000G8NVPW,I am so glad I purchase this..The way he breaks it down makes it so easy to learn. My kids are catching on so quickly..I also got this for myself to brush up on my math for College. I really love this DVD..This guy is a great Tutor.,1328918400,3,232,3.8541666666666665
2602338,5,B000G8NVPW,"I am using the DVD Tutor DVD's and companion CD worksheets for both of my children, who are at different grade levels. My daughter is using this DVD right now. When we first got the DVD and CD's in the mail, she was very nervous. ""I hate math, I don't like it... it's hard"". Right now, she is breezing through the lessons. The CD's are extremely helpful because they have 20-30 practice problems for each lesson and each step is detailed. I could not be happier. Thank you so, SO much for taking the fear out of math for my child. Also, the instructor is very pleasant and speaks in a kind tone and reassures the children during each lesson with things like, ""I know this looks different but it is not hard, just listen and follow the examples that I do and you'll realize how simple it is""! We really love the program and have had to interact with customer support one time and I got an email back IMMEDIATELY and it was pleasant and helpful. I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone whose child needs more math skills and confidence... and the price is very very reasonable when compared with a tutor.",1328486400,4,1103,4.411764705882353

2602340,4,B000G8NVPW,"The 1st - 7th Grade Math Tutor is good for older children, I would say for the 6 - 12 age group. The topics covered on DVD # 1 include addition of 1,2,3 and 4 digit numbers, subtraction of 1,2,3 and 4 digit numbers, introduction to multiplication, multiplication and division problems. DVD # 2 covers fractions, decimals, percents, and ratio & proportion. The DVDs provide excellent review for the older child (10 - 12), and good introduction for the younger child (6 - 9). The only minor drawback is that there are no graphics and music. The entire DVD features a math teacher working the problems on a white board. Because of this it may be a bit challenging to get a young child to sit still to view an entire lesson. However, I have found that it helps to sit through the lesson with the younger child and ask questions to make sure that he is following. A good programme, but maybe not ideal for someone who wants to be able to leave the child to watch while going off to take care of other tasks. (My score is actually 4.5 as I would only take off half a point).  This is a very good investment for your child.",1324684800,11,1116,4.314285714285714
2602341,5,B000G8NVPW,"MATH IS NOT HARD. YOU HAVE JUST HAD HORRIBLE TEACHERS. CONFIDENCE BOOSTING COURSES!
I graduated High School almost 10 years ago, about to go back to college possibly-Jesus willing, for a career change. I haven't done math in forever, but this program was exactly what I needed to get back in the groove of math. Now I've moved on, and continue to take Jason's courses online, they are all up there and available for 20 bucks a month, worksheets included--and I'm now going all the way through the Algebra 1 course. I work hard at it, and his method of teaching has completely REVOLUTIONIZED the way I view mathematics, and do math. I was failed by many teachers growing up, but now, I am learning the proper way to do these problems, from a proper teacher, who is teaching by examples--and breaking it all down--and the option to pause and review is always there--in math class, if you cant keep up, you get left behind..NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND? YEAH RIGHT!

I look forward to moving on from Algebra 1, all the way into his Calculus courses...why not!? That's the thing, when you are finally understanding concepts, that when you first learned them terrified you because you couldn't understand..Now that I understand them, and have built up my confidence, I feel like I can take on the world. Bring on more math! I am learning more now, than I have ever learned in my entire life with mathematics, and look forward to making this a lifetime study. Enjoying this up to the point where I can say that I love math. Math is no longer scary, now it's like playing Sudoku-or crosswords! MATH IS FUN!

The tutor was great; he doesn't acknowledge you as a he/she or old/young he just focus on teaching you the problem.
each section last about +20 minutes. you will learn that skill in that day after watching it.
