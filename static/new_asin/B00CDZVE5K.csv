8580684,4,B00CDZVE5K,Overall CD is very good except in the beginning the song keeps repeating until you hit fast forward. It true to all the CDs from no. 1. I am up to 5 so far. I'm debating if I should continue buying other volumes.,1404086400,,212,3.953488372093023
8580685,5,B00CDZVE5K,"I don't usually watch TV series from the Philippines but my wife was very insistent that I watch it.  The love story of ""Ser Chief"" and ""Maya"" is fun watching.  Without the DVDs availble for the first few weeks of the show makes it hard to follow, so, thank you Amazon.",1366243200,,269,4.254901960784314
