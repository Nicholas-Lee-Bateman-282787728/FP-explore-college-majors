1410279,4,B00005A059,"Bob James and crew at their best, Great start to grab your jazz musical interest.
Just in some places in the concert it slows down a tad bit but,launches back into jazz stratosphere.
I recommend buying this DVD",1335830400,,210,4.552631578947368
1410280,5,B00005A059,"Many jazz stars such as Boney James, Bob James, Kevin Mahogany, Larry Carlton, George Duke, Rick Brown and many others with the voice and beauty of Gabriela Anders together in an unforgetable jazz concert at the Montreaux Jazz Festival. The concert puts the talents of all musician at the scene and therefore, wonderful jazz music is performed minut by minut. This DVD should not be missing in the collection of the jazz lovers.",1326672000,,428,4.876712328767123
1410281,5,B00005A059,"I purchased the Casino Lights DVD because I wanted my son to see Kenny Garrett on sax to get a better understanding how one of the best saxophone player in the world plays from inside. I had taken my son to see Kenny Garrett live a few weeks before I purchased this older DVD. The DVD was to help him master his Alto Sax. Kenny, as always, played near perfection.

Now I knew that Kirk Whalum was also in this classic concert of 1999 but I did not realize just how good he can play! I have his three ""Gospel according to Jazz"" CD's and the last two volumes on DVD. They are great CD's and DVD's but do not compare to the way he played in this concert. He was outstanding and did things on his sax I had never heard before.

The whole concert is truly unbelievable and this is one of the better Jazz DVD's I have purchased (and I have a lot). Bob James and the first band were exceptional. Kirk Whalum was remarkable and extraordinary on Soweto. It was a treat to see Fourplay again. I have not seen them live for 10 years or more and to hear the way Nathan East plays that bass with the every dependable Harvey Mason on drums was a treat. It was really thrilling to see Larry Carlton playing as only he can play. He was just as good as he has always played even though he looked so much older. I showed my son a picture of him when he first joined Fourplay and my son was shocked that all that black hair had gone and what was left was gray but he sounded just as good.

The DVD featured George Duke (who we also saw just a few weeks ago) and on this DVD the newer rendition of Brazilian Love affair was nice. Boney James and Rick Braun actually surprised me in how well they can improvise as they are known for smooth jazz which is well scripted and predictable music. They stretched themselves and sounded like true jazz greats..

In short, anyone who wants to watch a serious Jazz concert on DVD, this one is a must!",1300665600,,1919,4.150537634408602
1410282,4,B00005A059,"I remember purchasing this cd! Hot! So when I saw that there was a DVD, I had to purchase it! It didn't disappoint either. Just the chance to see a young Boney James & Rick Braun, Kirk Whalem, Bob James, and the rest of the muscicians on stage ""playing music"" was a treat for me. Every performance was on point, the audio & visual were better than average, and the songs performed where ""funky""... This is not your ""elevator jazz"", this is smooth jazz with an edge! I recommend this cd to all smooth jazz lovers.",1290124800,,512,4.34375
1410283,4,B00005A059,"This video gives some of the high light performances from the 1999 Montreux jazz festival, it features some of today's top jazz artists such as Bob James, George Duke and Larry Carlton to name a few. Both the sound(DTS 5.1 & Dolby 5.1) and picture of this video are stellar. The performances in this approx. 2 hour video left me wishing for more but I guess that should be the aim of all great performances, leave the audience wanting more. This video is a most have for the collection of any jazz fan.",1241740800,,502,4.408602150537634
1410284,5,B00005A059,"I watched the DVD on a portable player with earphones, which greatly accentuates the music, but I wish they would have edited out the two farts during the piano part of Westchester Lady!  Otherwise, it is excellent.",1188172800,,215,4.8108108108108105
1410285,5,B00005A059,"Despite the age of this performance, this has to be one of the most outstanding live jazz performances available on DVD! If you love live jazz, you MUST add this to your DVD collection! You cannot go wrong!",1179014400,,206,4.447368421052632
1410286,5,B00005A059,"Was Googling for Bob James/FourPlay videos and came across this superb offering.  A love for music of all kinds (especially jazz) kept me around broadcasting for ""way too long"" (DJ's will know what I mean), but before, during and since those 23 years at no point have I ever run across a finer assemblage of talent, or a better portrayal of individual and group artistry, sound & video reproduction, song selection, you name it including unbeatable ""house ambience"" from the 1999 festival in Switzerland.  Musicians like those James guys, George Duke and Rick Braun you expect to deliver, but ""no dogs' are running with this pack and artists like Brazilian vocalist Gabriela Anders and keyboardist Mark Stephens hold their own and more.  ""Brazilian Love Affair"" is the finest single, improv performance I've ever seen or heard, what a cut!  Advice from here,  ""buy this DVD or we'll shoot your dog""! ; ))  One thing more, you won't go wrong with Gabriela's ""Wanting"" CD either, she's fantastic!",1177459200,,994,4.957831325301205
1410287,5,B00005A059,"I purchased this DVD for my husband, he would give it 10 stars if that was possible, it is a great concert with all the great jazz performers. This was a great purchase, everyone we show it to enjoys it very much.

THANK YOU",1170979200,,224,4.090909090909091
1410288,5,B00005A059,"This DVD offers you an elite group of smooth jazz artists collaborating to give you smooth jazz ""live"" at it's best.  The sound and picture quality are great. Each artist demonstrates their versatility during their solos on each song.  Don't sleep on this one, it's a keeper!!!  I only wish that more artists would consider offering their performances on DVD.",1157760000,,359,4.95

1410290,4,B00005A059,"Although many of these artists are best know for their smooth jazz label, this DVD jams!  The musicianship is excellent and the audio superb.  Billy Kilson on the drums is out of hand and I personally love Larry Carlton.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the fact it is not shot in widescreen and the video suffers (just a bit) in the translation to an HDTV.  Regardless, it is one of the best DVDs I own and I recommend it highly to any real music fan out there...it is very entertaining.",1127692800,3,499,4.221052631578948
1410291,5,B00005A059,Simply Brilliant! Worth the price just to watch Gabriela sing Fire of Love (10). Bob James and Fourplay are the icing on the cake!,1108771200,6,130,4.458333333333333
1410292,5,B00005A059,A DVD that I will never get tired of watching it over and over again. The artists are all good and the sound being a DTS is excellent. I recommend this highly to everyone for relaxing and entertaining. Simply the best.,1097798400,4,218,4.341463414634147

The adlib solos when all the artist come back on stage doing, Always There and Watermelonman, are just astounding.  Can't say enough about the caliber of these musicians.",1080172800,5,270,5.357142857142857
1410294,5,B00005A059,I am a true Smooth Jazz lover and this DVD is a MUST HAVE for sure!!!  All the performances were outstanding!  To see some of the best of the best all on the same stage was a treat!!  I recommened this DVD as a priceless jazz collectable.  I have no regrets that I ordered this.  More concerts of this nature should be available to people who truly love smooth jazz!!,1074470400,6,367,4.185714285714286
1410295,5,B00005A059,"I wasn't sure who was on the DVD besides Bob James & George Duke.  To my surprise and utter delight were Boney James, Rick Braun, Kirk Whalum, Larry Carlton (along with Fourplay), Gabriella Anders, and More!  And the SONGS! ""Notorious"" (Boney & Rick) is my all-time favorite smooth jazz song!  I was blown away, totally!! What a great concert.  And the close-ups were like being there on stage. Such a treat! Thank you for making this DVD available to us smooth jazz lovers!",1047859200,6,474,4.674698795180723
1410296,5,B00005A059,"This is by far my favorite DVD in a growing collection.  Unlike some critcs I can listen/watch this one over and over again. In fact, I have family & friends who come over just to see the DVD!!  The performers are so very talented and the love for music shows.  Their expressions are priceless. (If you've seen this one you know what I mean!)  Each performer showcases their own style of music and talent, so there's variety, but at the same time the music seems to meld together. The music is tight and .... just awesome.  This one is a definite must have!!  Can we have a Casino Lights '02?? ... PLEASE!!",1040860800,4,606,4.366071428571429

outstanding.",1036713600,,146,4.444444444444445
1410298,5,B00005A059,"If you like smooth, funky, & well arranged jazz, then this is the one for you. The artists that were combined on this collaboration are some of the best of the business, and there are some (in my opinion) up & comming young musicians I'm sure you'll be quite impressed with. I'mean if they weren't impressive they wouldn't be at Montreux, and they certainly wouldn't be sharing the stage with the likes of George Duke, Boney James, Kirk Whalum, Bob James, Rick Braun, Larry Carlton,  and so on. Take it from me, you'd be denying yourself an honest to goodness treat in some very tasteful, extraordinary contemporary jazz if you didn't grab this one...but considering the artists I mentioned, what do I know?",1025481600,3,707,4.747967479674797
1410299,5,B00005A059,"For Starters, I was told about this Concert by a very good friend of mine (J.C. good looking out) and he showed it to me, and without giving it a second thought, I bought it.
  If you love Concerts, if you love Jazz, THIS IS A MUST, NO QUESTIONS, JUST GET THIS . Kirk, Boney, Rick, and George Duke along with Bob James really delievers and it is nice to see Harvey Mason work out. Kenny Garrett is one of the best for Straight-ahead Jazz. I was down at the ""capitol Jazz. Com Festival"" last year and caught Rick Braun playing and he was the whole show. So this is a DVD you will not get tired of watching over and over. It's great for when you have company at the house. By the way, The Sound on this set is AWESOME. If you don't like this, You don't like Jazz Concerts.",1018656000,3,770,4.059210526315789

1410301,5,B00005A059,"I am a Jazz fan in the true sense, from Miles, Trane thru Weather Report, to the Blanchards, Bradens, Paytons. And the alleged smooth Jazz title and format has never captured my groove or soul. With a few Jazz tunes and mostly groove orientated r&b Jazz type songs, this dvd really surprised me. The musicians smoke and they all play at a very souful, passionate and incredible level ! Kirk Whalum can play ! You would not really experiance his passion and level of play unless you see him in concert or on this dvd. Boney James really surprised me, very soulful and passionate player ! From begining to end this dvd is superb ! All I need to say is go get it, and you will not regret it.",999734400,2,688,4.3
1410302,5,B00005A059,"I am astonished that Sam Graham is reviewing a jazz performance! Not to be too harsh but you missed the point guy! The whole structure of Jazz is to JAM and these players turn it out full steam ahead! Listen to the early guys that wrote the real stuff; Coltrane, Bird, Ellington,Miles for heaven sake, it was not all melody. There is a thing in Jazz called improvisation, and that is what is happening on the CASINO LIGHTS '99 DVD. A Jazz student could study this recording for a long time with all the different musical creations that take place on it. Check out some of the lines George Duke is playing behind some of the solos! Besides, it is great to see Kirk Whalum playing just as good as Garrett, and Boney demonstrates some serious ability here as well. Finally a few of the smooth jazz guys are letting the world know that they can play too! BUY THIS DVD you won't regret it!!! These are some of the most respected players alive today, and sorry Sam, if you didn't like this recording you must not like Jazz.",998352000,,1017,4.386243386243386

1410304,4,B00005A059,"The list of living jazz musicians making an appearance on this DVD is astounding, and believe me when I say...  they were at the top of their form! The recording quality is excellent and the music mix was good. The video quality was great (remember this is a live concert) except the fades to new shots to frequent for my taste, but not so much as to cause me not to enjoy every minute. Thats the good news. The only bad news is for those listeners who prefer very structured music just like it is on most of these artists individual albums. This is a losely structured jam session. But for me, that is what will make this one of my most played DVD's in my 100+ collection.",998006400,6,673,4.2578125
