8599015,1,B00DY9FDR4,"This movie is awful.  There's your one-word summary, just to be clear... AWFUL.  Not, ""oh, it's so scary, it's awful"" awful, or ""the gore is awful"" awful, but ""dreadfully bad, ill-conceived, complete disaster, bore fest"" awful.

The plot is laughable... the whole crazy redneck abduction killing thing is played out anyway, and in this case, so poorly done that you'll either find yourself laughing about it all, or cringing (I was cringing).

To be fair, Sherine Chalhie does a decent job, seeming way above the others in the film in acting ability... the others are local theater group level, if that.

I watched this for free on Amazon Prime, and still like I paid too much... I'll never get that wasted time back.",1466208000,,717,4.796747967479675

8599017,4,B00DY9FDR4,"Really creative film! Seen nothing quite like it before. I found it very intriguing and it kept me hooked until the end. I would give it a watch if you like countryside, lost and trying to escape movies.",1412380800,,203,4.368421052631579
