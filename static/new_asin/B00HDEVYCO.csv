8631619,3,B00HDEVYCO,Love this show. Love the Discs.  Hate the fact that Chicago Holiday Part 1 and 2 is missing even though it states it is on the DVD and I have the episodes The Wild Bunch and The Blue Line twice.  Bought this from another retailer however I see the same problem exists here. Sorry no mix up the episodes I am missing are no where in my collection. Wish there was a way to get just those two episodes as it is looks like I Will be buying Season 1 just to get those two. Very Disappointed.,1421971200,,486,4.0
8631620,4,B00HDEVYCO,"I feel the need to weigh-in here, to clear up (?) the confusion about the episodes on this set. The reviewers seem a bit mixed on what's in here - probably because it depends. I ordered from the ""67 Episode"" version on Amazon - I certainly didn't want to risk missing the pilot nor the other possibly missing episodes ""Chicago Holiday"" parts 1 and 2. But when it came, the sleeve proudly proclaimed 65 episodes (NOT what the site photo displayed). And the episode list on the back cover listed the pilot, but not the Chicago Holiday pair. Slightly freaked, I stuck the critical first 2 discs in, and...well, as stated in another of these reviews...fear not. The pilot is there (as it says it is), and the mysterious Chicago Fire episodes were also there. My suspicion is that the collection originally omitted them, probably due to incompetent production, but they later fixed it on the discs, but didn't update the outer sleeves. If that's the case, the 65 episode version may or may not have the 2 missing episodes (not to mention some missing pilots as described in other reviews). My discs state 2011 copyright. The outer sleeve states 2013 (which strains my ""older artwork"" theory - but I'm sticking with it). So the bottom line is I got mine, hopefully all the versions for sale on Amazon these days are likewise complete. It seems like ordering the 67 episode version is a safer bet than ordering from the 65 episode set, even though, as in my case, you may still get the 65 episode case, which will probably contain all 67 episodes anyway. Go figger! (And good luck.)

I gave this 4 stars because I agree that the video is typical analog TV quality - perfectly acceptable - not awe-inspiring.",1412035200,2,1700,4.629139072847682
8631621,4,B00HDEVYCO,"This set actually contains all 67 episodes which include the pilot.  I know it says 65 but really its 67. on 8 Discs. I will include an episode list so you know what your getting.

On the down side.  The layout sucks.  The episodes are strung together in two's and threes.  So you can't just go to an episode and watch, sometimes you have to scan through another episode or two.  That's why I didn't give it a 5.

One thing I did notice.  There are 4 seasons of ""Due South""  The Disc's say there are only 3 seasons. Don't know if they did that in order to stay at 8 disc's or if somebody made a mistake.

8631622,3,B00HDEVYCO,"Very disappointed over missing pilot episode. It does ruin the context of the series. The package advertises ALL 65 CLASSIC EPISODES. Then apparently the Pilot is not a classic?
Otherwise I like the nostalgic look back. Growing up in and around Chicago the scenes of the Loop and downtown back then are nice to see again. It's also apparent that although the street names are authentic, the locations (no way the intersection of Harlem and Belmont in the episode titled ""The Deal,"" was anything like the neighborhood near my home) and designations of north, south, east and west are anachronistic. Fraser is supposed to live on East Racine, but Racine runs North and South. It's still a fun series. Diefenbaker often steals the show!",1392076800,,733,4.919354838709677
8631623,2,B00HDEVYCO,"Actually purchased this a while back and just started to watch it. While still on season one it is so far missing two episodes (Chicago Holiday parts 1&2) and has the episodes The Wild Bunch and The Blue Line recorded twice! What's the deal here?!! Overall, still love the show, just wish it would come with what it actually says it comes with. On another note, my sister purchased the seasons separately and they do have ALL the episodes in the order they are supposed to be. If you don't mind the missing episodes, Walmart actually has the exact same thing for $10, save yourself over 30 and get it there!!",1390435200,8,608,4.486486486486487
8631624,1,B00HDEVYCO,"I purchased this video today from a local venue and my daughter and I just sat down to watch it.  The first disc goes in and starts with the second episode, despite the fact that the box says it starts with the pilot.  I was very disappointed and it left my daughter confused.  The quality of the discs is fair and I love the story but I have to give this 1 star for the bad start.",1387238400,,381,3.9220779220779223
