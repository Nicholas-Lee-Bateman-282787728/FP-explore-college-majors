I stumbled on this while looking for movies again and saw how much it costs now... wow

Decent movie, real 80s feel...

Someone said this movie is not cheap and has good effects for 1988.

I DONT agree with that at all.

In 1988, there were films with outstanding effects even in horror.

The blob remake is what I would call good efx for 1988 horror.

Overall okay though, the guy who did the creature effects in this movie was an extremely talented artist who worked on like silver bullet etc...",1338854400,2,543,4.37

8285421,2,6301879198,"this is a low budget movie from some of the same people who brought on  welcome to springbreak,so both movies have some things in commun;they both  feature a teenage sarah buxton, violence,murder,bad language,very little  suspense or tension (w2springbreak is slightly better in those 2 last  categories) ,some teens dancing to a pop band s music,very little nudity  (this one features a small breast nipple of a bloody dead teen  girl)and a  story that you wished was told in 45 minutes instead of 90.the cover of the  video box may make you think that the  film contains some kind of monster  but you d be wrong. all it features is some sort of monkeys and so most of  the movie only features cheap blood effects.i bought this movie because i  became a big fan of sarah buxton(who can be seen on the CBS soap the bold  and the beautiful)but i really wish she hadn t done this film in which she  seems to be wearing make up borrowed from the exorcist.like in most cheap  movies, the best is saved for the last(15 minutes)where there s some  original costumes and a slight scare.this may prove that the film may have  had a few good ideas but unless you re a passionate sarah buxton fan or a  curious person,there s not much you ll miss by never seeing this movie.",969235200,,1264,4.493392070484582
