647828,5,6303459838,"Despite the horrid theme 'song' and the early 1980s feel of the series, I have rarely laughed so hard aloud at any television programme. The late, great, and irreplaceable John Inman (most famous for his character Clayborne Humphreys of Are You Being Served?)simply outdoes himself as Graham Jones, the male secretary to a female executive. She puts him between a rock and a hard place time and again, but his patience and humour sees him through. I do think that the young girl playing the executive's daughter was miscast, as the character is a shrill troll and the actress keeps breaking character with out-of-place grins and giggles, but it is Mr. Jones who takes center stage in each episode. Owning this series on VHS, which I can no longer play, I have been waiting for years for it to appear on DVD. Alas, it is only on non-USA format (region 2), which is so disappointing. I still have hopes of a U.S. release.",1265673600,4,919,4.644171779141105
647829,5,6303459838,"This series might not be that well known in the US as it does not seem to make the PBS runs and there are few episodes. Some are a little lame, but some are fall on the floor hilarious. If you like John Inman in AYBS, give it a try.",1258761600,,232,3.66
647830,4,6303459838,"This delightful little comedy consists of six 25-minute episodes (on two tapes).  It stars John Inman (Mr. Humphries from Are You Being Served?) as Mr. Jones, the private secretary to business executive Joan Warner (Rula Lenska).  Ms. Warner lives with Lucy, her precocious 7-year-old daughter, and Maria, her highly-strung Italian maid (a very funny character).  The plots all centre on the tensions that arise in trying to balance the demands of a career with the demands required of a single parent, often with comical results.  Mr. Jones is inevitably the one called upon to achieve this balancing act, and his duties seem to involve sorting out domestic crises as often as executive ones.
Fans of Are You Being Served? (and particularly fans of John Inman) will, I'm sure, enjoy this light-hearted comedy, as Mr. Jones is not unlike Mr. Humphries (although without the mincing gait or references to his ""neither one way nor the other"" sexuality).  Though I must confess, personally, to a preference for Are You Being Served?, I really did enjoy this cute show (which is clean and suitable for the entire family).  Indeed, it was a delight to see John Inman in another role!",1006905600,10,1178,4.9543147208121825
647831,4,6303459838,"It's two videos, the message earlier only mentioned the episodes on Volume II (3 episodes), Volume I has three episodes also, ""The Interview"", ""The Protector"", and ""The Holiday."" As  you watch the episodes in order the show becomes more enjoyable because the  characters are,of course, evolving, given more time, the shows would've  become even better. The maid running up and down the stairs is hilarious,  and so is the end of the last episode (which looks like a blooper left in,  they looked so cute,laughing at Mr. Jones mimicking his boss).I couldn't  stand the little girl and the way the mother gives in to the brat. The  coworkers in the office were okay, the tall one and the mousy one were the  best characters as coworkers, John Inman's character could've had more fun  teasingly antagonizing the tall one, and ordering about the mousy one in  future episodes.  If you enjoy John Inman's work((he had and has so much  potential- I guess the industry he works in isn't smart enough and creative  enough to see his comedic potential--sigh--,we could have enjoyed some  great British comedy)) and/or think ""Are You Being Served?"" is  funny or just enjoyable, get these tapes. By the way, Rula Lenska, who  plays his boss, is a beautiful, tall woman (classy like Diana Rigg.) PS. I  put the four stars in for the ""Are You Being Served?"" fans.",945734400,9,1350,4.8

7847333,3,6303459838,"Excellent fast shipping by seller.  Just curious to see this John Inman show.  Not horrible, but very dated and not the best acting.  Probably good for the time period in which it was aired.",1414886400,,190,4.529411764705882
7847334,5,6303459838,Love John Inman's work.  Even though his character here is much different than Mr. Humphries he is still the capable worker loyal to his company and employer.  He of course gets caught up I he usual hectic scenes but manages to handle them gracefully.,1379721600,,251,4.681818181818182
7847335,4,6303459838,"This is a must-have for the rabid John Inman fans.  If you've never seen it before...well, I won't lie.  You won't like it that much.  Rula Lenska's role is a joke.  After five minutes I was screaming, ""We get it, bitch!  You're a woman in a man's world!  You weren't the only one in 1981.  Get over yourself!  And discipline your damn kid!""

Seriously.  Rula Lenska's character, Joan Warner, makes you wish she had stayed out of the workforce.  While Graham Jones (Inman) is trying his best to get his work done, Warner keeps asking him to accept tasks that are definitely not in any secretary's job description.  A few examples: Jones is asked to take Warner's daughter to the dentist, hem a dress, and cook a meal for a Japanese businessman.

Claudine Bowyer, who plays Lucy Warner (Joan Warner's daughter), is the epitome of ""brat"".  When she's not trying to manipulate her mother, she's making life hell for Jones.  Her screams could shatter the glass balls from Labyrinth.  I'm honestly surprised that Graham never walked out and cried for David Bowie to take Lucy away.  Then again, this was made in 1981.

Lastly, there is Miriam Margoyles.  Harry Potter fans will recognise her as Professor Sprout.  Here she is Maria, the ""mad I-talian maid"".  Poison oak rashes are quite soothing in comparison to Maria, and sadly, to Margoyle's acting.

I give this four stars because I am a rabid John Inman fan.  I found it quite refreshing to see him in something that didn't typecast him as another version of Claybourne Humphries.  There was no mincing.  No friends named Roger or Bobby.  He wasn't ""butch"", but he wasn't a limp-wristed nelly, either.

Now to find A Slight Case Of...",1364083200,7,1684,4.7172413793103445
7847336,4,6303459838,Didn't know much about this show but I am a great fan of John Inman from Are you being served. I was not disappointed. It was just as funny in his usual style.,1356220800,3,159,3.8484848484848486
7847337,4,6303459838,"Imagine my surprise when I found a series as obscure as this one for sale!  Considering there are only six episodes, anyone owning a working VCR would be much better off spending only a couple of dollars for 2 VHS tapes as opposed to over $20 for a DVD.  The quality of the transfer to videocassette is decent, but not perfect - keep in mind that the European PAL system never looks beautiful on American NTSC.  The picture contains some ghosting and has a washed-out look: this is more due to the PAL to NTSC transfer than the quality of the original broadcast tapes.  The intermission bumpers around the advertisements on British commercial television are missing, meaning act 1 runs straight into act 2 with a flash-cut - this can disrupt the timing of the episode somewhat, as the episodes were not meant to be watched with no break at all in the middle.  Still, despite these deficiencies, any fan of this hard-to-find series with a VCR will be glad to save nearly $20 by buying these videotapes instead of the much more expensive DVD.  The seller packed the tapes well and mailed them very promptly; they arrived a day before Amazon.com's earliest estimate.  In addition, they responded to my ""thank you"" email within an hour: not just a ""we'll respond soon"" notice, but an actual reply!  Where else can one get that kind of immediate service?",1323648000,,1349,4.662447257383966
7847338,4,6303459838,"Graham Jones just can't seem to get a break, thanks to his idiot coworkers and his boss' 'precocious' seven year old daughter.  But it's all in a day's work for him at Eight Star.
John Inman (best known for his role as Mr Humphries in 'Are You Being Served?') played Graham Jones in this very short-lived programme, along with Rula Lenska who played his boss, the only female executive at Eight Star (a fictional company) who is constantly struggling to keep her personal life separate from her business day.  However, thanks to her mad I-talian maid and her seven year old child, it's very difficult.  But thanks to Graham and his quick thinking she's able to save face in even the most daunting situations.
The programme itself is alright, but halfway through the first episode you will be in favour of corporal punishment not only for adults but also for small children.  Little Lucy will drive you up the wall with her screaming and bratty behaviour while Maria will simply make you groan from her stupidity.  Mrs Warner, sadly, perpetuates a lot of stereotypes regarding women in the workplace and female executives.  After ten minutes you will be rolling your eyes at this woman and shouting, 'We GET IT!  You're a woman in a man's world.  Get over yourself, sweetheart!  I know it was 1981, but COME ON!'
In short, it's worth buying if you're nostalgic for 1980s English comedy or you're a rabid John Inman fan.  Or if you just want to see him in something where he didn't mince.",1301616000,,1486,4.659003831417625
