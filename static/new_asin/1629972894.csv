8345155,5,1629972894,"What an excellent course.  Perhaps some details of neuroanatomy and physiology might seem excessive to the general viewer, but as a retired physician (internal medicine) I found the information to be both reliable and necessary for supporting conclusions.  As a person currently facing many of the consequences of aging, I greatly appreciate the documented suggestions for delaying some of these by modifying diet, activity, socialization, stress reduction and others.  I will recommend this course to  friends and family.",1483920000,6,522,5.653846153846154
