8153439,4,B000JVT0E2,Very informative.  Well worth having when looking for information on Buddhism.,1418428800,,78,6.090909090909091
8153440,5,B000JVT0E2,"Fascinating and inspirational viewing. The stories are rich in meaning and can be newly enjoyed again and again. Being a trilogy, it doesn't need to be viewed in one sitting.",1403827200,,174,4.833333333333333
8153441,5,B000JVT0E2,"One reviewer complained that this documentary was misleading, because it was not filmed in Tibet. It's not misleading if you know anything about Tibetan history. In the 70's China wasn't letting foreigners into Tibet to do documentaries on Tibet. And it's still difficult today. Even now, in the 21st Century, Tibetan's are arrested by the Chinese government for being in possession of a picture of the Dalai Lama. They are an oppressed culture. The real culture lives in exile primarily in India and Nepal, where the film is shot. And that's because China invaded Tibet in 1951, murdering millions of Tibetans including tens of thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns. They destroyed temples and everything ""Tibet"". So, if you want some pretty pictures of the Tibetan countryside, this documentary is not for you. But if you want to learn about Tibetan culture and see early footage of the Dalai Lama and hear from scholars like Thupten Jinpa, this is a great piece of history.",1356134400,6,975,4.951219512195122
8153442,1,B000JVT0E2,"Two things they don't bother to tell you is that this intensely boring doc was made in the mid '70's and feels like it, plus not a frame of it was actually shot in Tibet. Isn't this totally misleading?

The film was shortened from its original 4 hour length which further contributes to its vacuousness and lack of direction. Maybe some feel that the torpor induced by this film is akin to a meditative trance.

I felt ripped off by buying this film as it represents itself as something very different. The few positive reviews are from 30 years ago. Buyer beware, unless you wish to be bored into another dimension.",1215216000,17,616,4.54054054054054
8153443,5,B000JVT0E2,This film provides a good insight into buddhist monks's rituals and everyday life as well.,1210464000,,90,5.066666666666666
8153444,5,B000JVT0E2,"I'm really happy that I purchased Tibet: A Buddhist Trilogy. This video is a rare glimpse into Tibetan Culture. The segment on the Dalai Lama addressing his people is not only instructive but  heart warming. Hearing the sounds of Tibetan music, language and seeing the people's living environment gives a real sense of Tibetans re creating their culture outside of their homeland. The segment on the intellectual training of monastic studies showed the quick thinking and understanding needed to master the required skills of debate. This video can be seen again and again with new perspective each time. I do recommend this video. There is a freshness and an aliveness to the video that will educate and inform generations of people. I'm so glad the videographer had the foresight to create this documentary. We are all the better for having this kind of quality of documentary in our lives.  contributed by: Jacqueline",1200096000,23,920,5.046052631578948
8153445,4,B000JVT0E2,"I was excited to see Tibet but a bit disappointed that in spite of the title it was actually filmed in the Tibetan regions of India and Nepal in the 1970's. There is a powerful initiation ceremony that stretched my sense of time, and a wonderful scene of a much younger Dalai Lama offering blessings to the exiled Tibetans in India. The final part is an emotionally challenging but moving scene of of the death and funeral of a member of the Buddhist community in Ladakh with incantations of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. If you have an interest in Tibetan Buddhism this is recommended.",1194048000,22,586,4.537735849056604
8153446,5,B000JVT0E2,"This is an astonishing experience for those interested in Tibet, Buddhism
or other cultural forms of worship. The early footage of His Holiness The Dalai Lama is deeply moving to see his love & care for the exile community in India. Graham Coleman's approach to documentary - bearing witness simply to what is unfolding brings a profound sharing of rituals and the mystical realm. As a fellow filmmaker I am in awe of what he accomplished. This is essential viewing. Bravo!",1191715200,29,473,4.851851851851852
