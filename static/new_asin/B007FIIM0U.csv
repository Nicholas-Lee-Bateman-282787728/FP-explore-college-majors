5082529,1,B007FIIM0U,This isn't even a film. This is a slide show with the same information repeated over 15 minutes. Then the rest is just pretty much the same pictures. HORRIBLE!,1347148800,17,159,4.517241379310345
5082530,1,B007FIIM0U,I can't believe I wasted the buck 99 to rent this. If I could rate less than 1 star I would. Somebody at Amazon should screen out trash like this.,1346198400,9,146,3.9
5082531,1,B007FIIM0U,"I was expecting a 58 minute program, but was treated to 15 minutes of narration (often repeated). Yes, google would have been more effective. Amazon, shame on you. $3 for a 15 minute short, billed as a longer feature. There is far better fare on U-Tube",1344902400,24,252,4.5
5082532,2,B007FIIM0U,"Don't waste your money.  You can look up Billy Gohl on the internet and learn more about him.  The ""movie"" is more of a slide show lasting 15 minutes with narration.  Then you get to watch the same 15 minute slide show without the narration.  I had never heard of Billy Gohl and was ver interested in this documentary, but was very disappointed when I viewed it.  Even the 15 minutes of narration repeats information several times, undoubtably to prolong it.  I enjoy true crimes and mysteries, especially serial killers, but this documentary is not worth the purchase price.  It views more like an amateur film student project.  Again, the internet will provide more satisfying results if you want to learn the story of Billy Gohl (pronounced like ghoul, somewhat ironic).",1338336000,17,773,4.847328244274809
5082533,1,B007FIIM0U,"Wow, what can I say. 15 minutes of the most amateurish narration I have ever heard, saying the same things over and over again with the same 3 photographs and then 40 minutes of ""Raw"" footage which consists of what looks like some guy walking around in his backyard but we don't know because there is no narration or dialog just random pictures and the ""Raw"" footage and some captions.

I can't believe that Amazon is charging for what appears to be a high school history project and a poor one at that as a full length documentary.

Do NOT download this film you WILL be disappointed.",1334793600,40,585,4.457943925233645
5082539,1,B007FIIM0U,"Worst Movie, seems to be shot with a hand cam, very little background, not really a serial killer - a mass murderer for profit.",1454198400,,127,4.333333333333333
5082540,1,B007FIIM0U,"Do not waste your money, Only 15 minutes of some guy talking and pictures of nothing really. Then 15 minutes of the same pictures over and over no one saying anything!",1446681600,,167,4.419354838709677
5082541,1,B007FIIM0U,Absolutely awful. Paid $1.99 for a 15 minute PowerPoint (sounds like a high school presentation) and the rest is just a slideshow of pictures! There's no words! Don't waste your money.,1444521600,,184,4.967741935483871
5082542,1,B007FIIM0U,Perhaps the worst documentary  I have ever watched.  Ever.  I would rather watch a celebrity sex tape of Paula Poundstone & Dom DeLuise than watch this again.,1444003200,,158,4.777777777777778
5082543,1,B007FIIM0U,bad more then half is a slide show don't do it!!!!!!!!,1440892800,,54,4.0
5082544,1,B007FIIM0U,"I ordered this ""movie"" American's worst serial killer ever.  It was advertised as a 51 minute movie but was really a 15 minute power point with voice over and a 36 minute slide show.  This is absolutely the worst case of false advertising I've come across. It's undeserving of even one star.",1431561600,,291,4.576923076923077
5082545,1,B007FIIM0U,Worst piece of crap ever. I've seen better YouTube videos than this. Do not get ripped if like I did!,1430611200,,101,4.1

5082548,2,B007FIIM0U,"I use Amazon quite a bit for purchases so I am pretty familiar with it , that being said, I rented this to watch on my laptop and I would have to say this, is not very well done, I live in the area and have been through this town many times the first 15 minutes are decent enough but then it just kind of flattens out the last ten minutes is silence panning over modern buildings that are in terrible condition, not very interesting but since it was just 2 dollars it was ok .. Oh yea the one thing that interested me was the fact I have  lived here for my whole life 50 some years and never heard of this guy , We got Ted Bundy  And Gary ridgeway from here too, both serial killers but apparently this guy has killed more people then anybody and yet nobody has made a big movie on it yet , well this review may do it for them , this could be an interesting Hollywood production....",1426377600,,882,4.005681818181818
5082549,1,B007FIIM0U,"This should have been titled ""America's Worst Serial Killer Story EVER"" I wish I had read the comments before paying for this crap..

Come On Amazon...I could've made this myself at home with my phone. TERRIBLE",1422921600,,210,4.833333333333333
5082550,2,B007FIIM0U,"Was interested in this story since it happened not far from hear, but this thing would have benefitted from better narration and having a budget of more than $20. Thppppptttt!!!",1419033600,,177,4.933333333333334
5082551,1,B007FIIM0U,What a disappointing waste of time and money. Don't even bother. Shame on you Amazon for even suggesting this. It should be entirely removed from your list. At the very least it should be included in Prime so that your customers don't waste their money.,1418169600,,253,4.644444444444445
5082552,1,B007FIIM0U,"Badly written and awful editing. It looks like a 9 year old did it as a project. The actual content is only about 20 minutes long and most of that repeats itself, the rest is a repetitive slide show of pictures. Awfully bad!  Even you get it for free, it is a waste of your time.",1418169600,,279,3.982142857142857
5082553,1,B007FIIM0U,"Seriously terrible,

The below amateur quality, lack of skill, knowledge and seemingly challenging articulation from the documentarians in addition to the constant redundancy, and stick figure ""animation"" made this seem as though it was a project from a middle-school student in a mentally challenged educational facility. This is not meant to be mean, but rather very accurate.",1418169600,,378,5.631578947368421
5082554,2,B007FIIM0U,"Wishing I could get my money back on this movie... I watch a lot of documentaries, this one was mostly in pictures and amateur video
 I wouldn't have minded so much if there were more meat to the story. The video was like watching a 6th grade history presentation.",1414800000,,264,4.387755102040816

5082556,1,B007FIIM0U,"Utterly atrocious. More like a junior high school project (you'll see what I mean if you rent it) than anything else. And it would have earned an F. This is one of those basement project videos some clown will make and upload just to try and sneak some money out of the suckers who rent it, like me.",1411516800,2,299,4.172413793103448
5082557,1,B007FIIM0U,"This wasn't worth the $1.99 to rent it let alone $9.99 to buy it. Aside from looking like a poor high school history project, the over 50 minutes the ""documentary"" claims consists of about 15 minutes of narration with the remaining time spent flashing the same pictures over and over with no narration. Don't waste your money or time.",1407024000,,334,4.677966101694915
5082558,1,B007FIIM0U,"The narrator sounded like he was doing an oral report about Billy Gohl to his class of teenagers .  He kept repeating Billy Gohl's name throughout. Well, I guess he wanted to make sure we knew who he was talking about. Oh, how I wish I'd have paid attention to the one-star reviews.  It was a huge waste, and it wasn't even interesting.",1404518400,,336,4.317460317460317
5082559,3,B007FIIM0U,"SUPER BAD! Everything the 1 star reviews say is true. I was so pissed at Amazon for even having this for me to rent... Then I got on here to wright a review and warn people and.. reading all the reviews and knowing how bad the ""movie"" was.. well I started laughing at all the pissed off people. So in closing it was worth the $2 to laugh at others pain...",1403222400,,355,4.014084507042254
5082560,2,B007FIIM0U,This is a dry historical documentary for the purposes of juvenile detention reform...without actual correlation to modern institutions and practices.,1398729600,,149,6.5
5082561,2,B007FIIM0U,Very very short film.. It was an ok documentary when it came to learning about an American killer that I've never heard of before. Again really short and then kept replaying itself over and over which I think was to make you think the documentary was much longer than it actually was.,1396310400,,284,4.480769230769231
5082562,1,B007FIIM0U,"Sentences are repeated over and over, photographs are used over and over and a total of only two pictures of the subject means I screwed up! Read the reviews!",1395100800,,158,4.482758620689655
5082563,1,B007FIIM0U,A most deceptive piece of trash.....I really don't know anymore about this than I did before. and U had the audacity to charge for it? shame on you!,1390435200,,148,4.321428571428571
5082564,1,B007FIIM0U,"As documentaries go, this one is pretty bad.  It has a few nice historic photos, if authentic, but the narration is high school level and very repeatative.  It told me nothing I didn't know.  Clearly this WAS NOT a professional endeavor.  Keep at it though, you only have upward to go.
Save your money though, Mill Creek has better stuff.",1389312000,,338,4.583333333333333
5082565,5,B007FIIM0U,"what an interesting movie. although he wasn't very creative in how he disposed of his victims, gotta give him credit for the number he killed.",1380672000,,142,4.72
5082566,1,B007FIIM0U,Absolutely horrible movie.  This must've been some high school kid's A/V lab project.  He should've gotten an F-minus-minus.  I want my $1.99 back.  (Plus the 20 minutes I wasted watching this abomination before I turned it off in utter disappointment.),1379635200,,253,5.25
5082567,1,B007FIIM0U,"WARNING... WARNING... CRAPPY SHOW....I'm shocked that this amateurish video is actually offered on Amazon. I've never seen anything this bad before and I actually feel ripped off. Like the previous reviewer states, ""Don't waste your money on this""...and that ain't no lie. 15-18 minutes of bad narration,  the same few  photos over and over  and the last 30-35 minutes is just video being shot in the woods, along a river, and in the town. I tried not to give this show any stars, but unfortunately,  I couldn't finish the review unless I clicked at least one star, which is one star too many for this show. The only upside to this is, if they ever have an America's Worst Serial Killer show...then, 5 stars it is!",1372896000,5,714,4.642857142857143
5082568,1,B007FIIM0U,"Sometimes a film can be so bad it's funny (Troll 2, for example).  This is just bad. Really really bad.  Maybe I'll go outside now and watch my plants grow; that will be way more entertaining than finishing this sucky-mentary.",1372636800,2,226,4.625
5082569,1,B007FIIM0U,"This is the worst documentry of any kind the I've ever seen. It would not even pass as a college student project. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,!",1364601600,4,139,4.185185185185185
5082570,2,B007FIIM0U,"Poorly done, slow moving and boring. Reminded me of a nicely done project for a high school class. Should have been 10 minutes long.",1359331200,,132,4.541666666666667
5082571,1,B007FIIM0U,This movie is one of the most terrible movies I ever watched. Very poorly done. I would like a refund really.,1358294400,2,109,4.238095238095238
5082572,1,B007FIIM0U,You should be ashamed of yourself for even listing this terrible amateur slideshow much less charging for it. Anyone who has rented this movie deserves a double refund for the offense.,1358121600,,184,4.967741935483871
5082573,5,B007FIIM0U,"Not bad movie. But they just don't make scary movies like they use to. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.
Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next",1357171200,,236,4.266666666666667
5082574,1,B007FIIM0U,Very amateurish video with flat narration from what seems like a badly written junior high book report. I can't say too much more - I could only stand to listen to about 5 minutes before turning it off.,1354492800,4,202,4.342105263157895
5082575,1,B007FIIM0U,This is a total rip-off. It sounds like a bad narrator reading a 5th grade report that is poorly written. And the narration lonly lasts a few minutes before there is no narration only slides of the same photos playing over and over again.  I did not listen to previous reviews BUT I SHOULD HAVE!!  Don't make the same mistake I did - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,1353801600,13,358,4.3283582089552235
5082576,1,B007FIIM0U,This is one of the worst dvd's that I have ever purchased.  There is a total of 15 minutes of the killer.  There is 35 minutes of absolute garbage.  Don't waste your money.  This is not even worth the cost of shipping.  You can get better info of Billy Gohl on the internet.  The production of this dvd is very poorly done.,1353456000,10,323,4.129032258064516
5082577,1,B007FIIM0U,"This video is only 15 minutes long, and that's about 14 minutes longer than it should have been. Too bad, as the subject could have made an interesting movie. What's criminal is that they charged money for it. And I was stupid enough to pay for it.",1352592000,13,248,4.297872340425532
5082578,1,B007FIIM0U,"An amateurish, superficial look at Billy Gohl, America's worst ever Serial killer is short with a narration read

8515791,1,B007FIIM0U,"I would give this -5 stars if I could. It has no real information, repeats itself constantly, has continuity issues, and can't even seem to match the narration to the video. I've purchased a LOT from Amazon video, and I have never felt more cheated. It gives this 2 stars on screen when you read the synopsis befor renting, and I can only conclude the makers of this messterpiece have large families who gave it 5 stars to offset the 1 star ratings from people who sadly paid for it.",1473033600,,483,4.377777777777778
