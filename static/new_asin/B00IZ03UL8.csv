I can believe it bought it for here it is right in front of me.....for the moment anyway.  the dvd is going out to the trash, but I am keeping the artwork to remind me to hold my curious nature at bay somewhat.  this is the most ridiculous, juvenile, phony, put-on I think I have ever watched.  I realize that stupidity is not illegal, however, this dvd could be what starts the beginning of the thoughts of such a law  save your time.  save your money.  save your sanity.",1530057600,,623,4.099173553719008

8646706,5,B00IZ03UL8,"The gangs all here again for another couple hours of superbouts that are never dull, sometimes funny, often sexy.  It would seem a gathering of ultra-fit teens-and-20's like these could only come out of Southern California, and so they did, ready for anything in the ring or out of it, near the pool or at the beach, their super hot Speedos keeping them -- uhh -- super cool.  Oh very cool.  The superstars, single & tag team, are back and naturally in great shape in a series of matches that are full of surprises, athletic prowess and several low blows -- all in fun of course.  Hot stuff if you're in that kind of mood, great eye candy regardless of what your mood may be.  Even if you think you already own this DVD, it's been upgraded and amended with new stuff and technically improved old stuff -- all of it exciting.",1402963200,2,824,4.394736842105263
8646707,5,B00IZ03UL8,"The original Season 2 was dynamite!  This one is actually better.

The picture is remastered, there are lots of fresh faces, and all kinds of previously unreleased material.  The matches are lit afire with gorgeous home grown wrestlers, such as The Brody Bros and Dangerous Devon, as well as lots of indy circuit talent like Brian Cage, Ryan Taylor, and Johnny Yuma.

The hotness of the wrestlers is off the charts, the action is nonstop; what more could you want from a wrestling DVD?

If you love Indy wrestling, I highly recommend this.",1395532800,2,539,4.752688172043011
