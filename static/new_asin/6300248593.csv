275709,3,6300248593,"unfortunately, as I am writing a review in the 90's it is quite dated but this film was really action packed for it's time! I can't quite relate to the gangster aspect as I live in a quiet part of Bristol, England. - But I  should imagine that a lot of people from England can (i.e from Easton or  St. Pauls)",950313600,2,308,4.032786885245901
275710,5,6300248593,"IN THE WORDS OF EBERT AND THE LATE GREAT SISKEL, ""TWO ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP.""  BUT SERIOUSLY FOLKS, THIS MOVIE IS ONE FOR THE AGES.  ITS ABOUT A WHITE INSURANCE MAN WHO GETS CAUGHT IN THE PROJECTS AFTER DARK  AND TRIES TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE STILL IN TACT.  WATCH IT AND SEE HOW HE  DOES IT. OR DOES HE?  I HOPE IT COMES ON VIDEO SOON!!!",919641600,8,339,4.0606060606060606
7807224,3,6300248593,"Enemy Territory was a pretty good movie & better than I expected it to be. I watched it from start to finish on the edge of my seat, wondering if & how Ray Parker Jr. (Yes, that Ray Parker Jr.) & the insurance salesman would make it out of the projects alive. Speaking of Ray Parker Jr., I didn't realize he was in the movie until I saw it on imdb. Kadeem Hardison was in it as well as A-Train. A young Tony Todd was most evil as the leader of The Vampires & Jan-Michael Vincent was great as the Vietnam vet who turned his apartment into a bunker & the only tenant The Vampires were scared of because he was the only 1 who would shoot back. (Did Jan-Michael Vincent's character remind anybody else of Rowdy Roddy Piper or was it just me?) Even though it did keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time & was better than I expected, Enemy Territory isn't a movie I'd watch that often but I would watch it again. It had my attention while it was on but after it was over, I was like...... I'd recommend anybody & everybody go see it though. It's most definitely worth watching, at least once",1487548800,,1092,4.131455399061033

7807230,5,6300248593,Enemy Territory has been one a great movie the 80's All the actors did a great job in this movie. I don't want to give too much details about the movie but I can share with you that Jan Micheal Vincent plays an insurance man who goes to a troubled neighborhood to collect insurance from one of the elderly tennet. Once he goes in the run down projects he is taken by surprise by the local vampire street gangs that put fear into the neighborhood. He is fulled with terror but then Ray Parker jr an electrician steps in to help him and later both team up to stop the vampire street gangs and their vicious vampire leader Tony Todd. There were actors like Stacy Dash and Deon Richmond that did a good job in this movie. This movie is worth seeeing and purchasing. I wish this movie was on dvd. I would definantely recommend this movie to everyone.,1296432000,,845,4.320754716981132
7807231,5,6300248593,"This movie is one of my all time favourites. I remember first watching it at the end of the 80s on the strength of Jan Michael Vincent being in it, being a big Airwolf fan, I thought it worth a rent.
I'm really glad I did, it's a very well acted, stylish, tense thriller which altho now is obviously dated still grips me like it did the first time I watched it. Even tho JMV only has a small role this does not bother me as the other performances are equally top-notch, especially Gary Parker and Ray Parker jnr (who lets face it had no acting experience at all). Stacy Dash and Tony Todd also make great co-stars.
I won't go over the plot line as it's been covered here already but I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good late nite thriller with a bit of 80s nostalgia thrown in.
I really wish this would get the DVD release it deserves, I don't even recall it ever being shown on TV here in England either which is a crime!
A true underated little gem!",1248307200,5,972,4.175531914893617
7807232,5,6300248593,It was a bold move to picture some of fellow Americans as our enemies. But this is the sad truth. Gangsters and inside terrorists  ARE dangerous to honest citizens. This movie depicts this danger in vivid details.,1156896000,,213,4.756756756756757
7807233,4,6300248593,"the only reason i watched the movie was because my cousin was in it(the kid in lobby w/ the switch blade)but after watching it i got into the tale of the white insurance guy stuck in the projects with no way out..you will have to watch it to see what this man goes thru..but if you look closely you will see a young stacey dash, kadeem hardisson and a couple of others..i really hope this movie gets a remake or goes on dvd soon...great to add in that dvd collection..",1118361600,9,468,4.211111111111111
