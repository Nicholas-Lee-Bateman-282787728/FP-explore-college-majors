8623671,3,B00GJ00EO2,"Unlike so many Bollywood productions, this one is fairly polished. I note that several groups in India have tried to ban the movie as it portrays the LTTE as terrorists. Here's a hint: they are terrorists, and have been listed as such by both the US and Indian governments. India was the first to do so, and the US followed suit, despite the fact that the LTTE posed no threat to US interests.

What I found ridiculous about the film were the attempts to misdirect the audience. Possibly this is more Indian government disinformation. The film seems to indicate ""shadowy western figures"" in this matter. The fact remains that the LTTE simply had no connections with any western ""group"". Prabakharan used money obtained from his people abroad to finance his insurgency. The LTTE's attempt to carry out a transaction on US soil ended up in several people going to prison in 2006. No, clearly someone was trying to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to show some sort of western involvement that simply did not, and does not, exist.

Why would they want to do that? Well, I guess disinformation works to a degree. During the period between 2001-2009, the US was believing all sorts of disinformation campaigns. This one is no different.

I generally thought the technical aspects of the film were well done, and appreciated John Abraham's fine performance. It's not simple Bollywood fare. However, it would be good to reexamine the facts at some later date. I would also like to see a film portraying the more recent events in Sri Lanka.....and India's role.",1423440000,,1549,4.815789473684211

8623673,5,B00GJ00EO2,If you know or have been to South India and spent some time with these people it will make you very emotional at first.  John Abraham plays Indian covert operation for Indian Military and assumes high risk with the issues surrounding his operation of infiltrating the Tamil Tigers.  Shows significant Indian history events that really happened.  One movie you will never forget and never a dull moment.,1401321600,,402,4.970149253731344
