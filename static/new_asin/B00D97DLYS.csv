5782285,5,B00D97DLYS,If you like digital comics then you will really love this one it shows how much they have improved with there animation.,1379808000,,120,4.5
5782286,2,B00D97DLYS,"I made the mistake of getting this thinking that it would be something more than a bad rendition of the comics.  It is one of the more interesting comic story lines that follows the classic Hulk vs. Wolverine origin back in Incredible Hulk 181.

I knew as soon as I realized that it was a ""Marvel Knights"" title that I was in trouble.  It is not animation, but a video comic.  It has cheesy motion effects that attempt to give the consumer ""something different"", but it is a throw back to the 1960's TV shows with Captain America and Thor with voice overs of still shots.  It was the first Marvel Knights title I picked up and it will be the last.

I give it two stars because it was not falsely advertised, but I will say that I didn't enjoy it.  The breaks and segmenting was annoying and the hacked story line was worse.  If you want the story read the comics in either their original form or in a trade paperback.  Don't go with the Marvel Knights titles they are just a vaporous adaptation of the true art form.  Not real animation and not a real comic.  Made for the die hard fan boy that must have all things Wolverine and not someone who wants entertainment that is thoughtful.",1379376000,,1185,4.316742081447964
5782287,5,B00D97DLYS,"Hulk vs wolverine is a great movie. If you looking for CGI or Just animated cartoons like x-men of the 90s than this may not be for you, but if your a comic lover and appreciate the art than this animated motion comic hits it head on with great graphic detail should not be purchased for little kids. All in all great presentation although could make more speacial features.",1379376000,,374,4.434782608695652
5782288,2,B00D97DLYS,"This is not a movie, this is a digital motion comic like you'd download on your phone for the Marvel or DC app.

And frankly if you've already read the comic that this is based on that came out in 2009, then you've already seen this ""movie.""  So there's not really any reason to pay to watch it again cuz it's basically a re-run.

The only really good part is that it reminded me of a really awesome comic that I read four years ago.",1379203200,2,433,4.070588235294117
5782289,5,B00D97DLYS,"I love these motion comics because they use the actual art from the comics rather than reinterpret it at an animation house which then ends up making it look cartoony.  These serious graphic novel worthy stories would look odd in a cartoon universe.

These are more akin to the incredibly limited animation Marvel comics were done I. The 60s which also utilized actual art from the books.

I loved the art in this series so it goes without saying I really dig this interpretation, but if you're looking for a fully animated cartoon this isn't it.  What it is: a more precise adaption of the story with a full cast, sound effects, music and animated elements.  Each episode is only a few minutes long but the art is stunning and the voice actors are well above what most cartoon shows can offer.

This hybrid of comics and cartoons is a must have for folks like me who appreciate the art in a series as much as the story, and want to see that art represented in the adaption.

This particular story is definitely NOT for kids.",1379116800,5,1025,4.478494623655914
5782290,4,B00D97DLYS,"I concur with Chongo. His review is excellent. I have enjoyed all of Marvel's animated comics so far with their first one, Spider Woman: Agent of Sword, being my favorite although the mouths didn't move in that one. This form of entertainment allows for the original artwork to be shown so each motion comic is unique. None of these are for children. As for J. Holleran, Marvel has now released 11 motion comics and they all come packaged in stunning artwork in cardboard covering saying ""Marvel Knights."" Marvel Knights is a give away for knowing it's a motion comic. Marvel's animated movies will say ""Animated Marvel Features"" or something similar and it will be packaged in the standard DVD of Blu-ray type packaging. The chapters are short and follow the comic book and it's sure different from standard animated presentations but give it a try and I think most comic fans will enjoy this new type of entertainment.",1378857600,11,920,4.829113924050633
5782291,5,B00D97DLYS,"Marvel Knights Animation continues it's excellent line of motion comics with an adaptation from Marvel's Ultimate imprint. While I personally don't like the ""ultimate"" stuff & really haven't been all that thrilled with most of Marvel Comics' newer books lately, I really loved this feature showcasing the mighty art of Leinil Francis Yu with a tale penned by Lost scribe Damon Lindelof. I feel a lot of the Marvel stories come across better in this form, & pretty much ALL of the Marvel motion comics have been top notch products with Spider-Woman -Agent of S.W.OR.D, Black Panther, & Thor/Loki -Blood Brothers being some of my favorites. If your not familiar with motion comics, imagine an animated feature & dialogue thats adapted 110% off the comic panels. Beautiful comic book art subtlety animated with a voice cast, sound effects, & the kitchen sink. Marvel Knights Animation motion comics are the real deal & are sure to replace the printed form of comics in the not too distant future. As long as Marvel keeps making these, I'll keep buying them. Solid entertainment worth you pennies.",1378857600,,1093,4.978142076502732
5782292,1,B00D97DLYS,"Be warned - in appearances this seems to be an original Marvel animated feature, but it is NOT.  It is a ""motion comic"", which takes still art panels from the comic books and adds minimal digital animation to make the characters' mouths move, heads turn and such.  This was a blind rental for me, so fool me once I guess.
Given that the DC Comics direct-to-video animated features are generally well-done, I wanted to give Marvel a try, but this rental was a big mistake.  Hopefully this type of video will be more clearly labeled in the future. Don't be fooled like I was!",1378857600,9,573,4.490384615384615

5782305,1,B00D97DLYS,"Marvel Knights has fallen to a new low with this excuse of an animation movie.
The writing is atrocious and the light porn and vulgarity is as usual, totally unnecessary.
I just don't get it, its like all the best writers have avoided the Marvel Knights like the plague.
Hard to believe that this was based on an actual comic.
Its like a group of crack smoking kids got together and put this story together.
Sorry guys but I just cant find anything redeemable about this weird dvd.
Wolverine is indestructible and can survive being torn in half by Hulk or having his head cut off by
Fury, Betty Ross is a slut who injects herself with a modified super soldier serum and become a she Hulk, Forge is so super talented that he can travel through toilets using a sound fork, Hulk is a strange homicidal killing machine that like to be surrounded by practically naked women and shifts from intelligent to dumb when anyone mentions Betty to him and so on and so on.

Everyone involved with this project deserves to take the blame for this poor finished product.
Apparently, neither Executive producers Alan Fine, Dan Buckley, Joe Quesada, Jeph Loeb, Co-producers Stan Lee, Eric Radomski, Supervising producer Kalia Cheng, Consulting producer Todd Casey or Director Carl Upsdell could help writer Damon Lindelof write a better script or steer him away from this atrocity.

It is clear that the target audience is not us levelheaded thinking Marvel fans, so there must be an awful lot of strange, unbalanced, mentally unstable people out their buying comic and dvd that these guys think they need to cater to in order to pay the bills.

Not sure what to do with my copy of this dvd, I don't associate with strange people that would enjoy watching this kind of animation. I guess I can keep it in my library as an example of Marvel Knights at their worst until they outdo themselves with something worst.",1421971200,3,1895,4.667664670658683

5782308,2,B00D97DLYS,"Now the reason I don't like this version of Wolverine vs Hulk is because the story is TERRIBLE for one thing. Hulk is acting like a playboy with girls all over him and his speech is too articulate. Hulk is not supposed to be like that, comparing from the classic type Hulk i know in past comics, plus he carries on a human type conversation which he does with Wolverine like its just two guys talking tough. The only thing good is the comic art that this feature was made from. So that being  said, if the story is badly written on this DVD, then its the same in the graphic novel version too. This just sucks.
For the record... I enjoyed the Marvel Knights Xmen digital novels on DVD. Great story, art and voice overs. Recommend those over this one for sure!",1415664000,,759,4.3076923076923075

5782326,2,B00D97DLYS,"If you don't know this is not a cartoon, it's animated comic book pages.  If you've never seen one I wouldn't recommend starting here.  A motion comic is only as good as it's story and the story here isn't very good.  I should have remembered that because I actually own the graphic novel as well.  I love the Ultimate line but I wouldn't have picked this story to tell.  It starts off okay but it's completely train wrecks at the end.  Most of the comedy misses it's mark and out of the Ultimate universe's context I'm not sure the story really works either.  I imagine the uninitiated wondering why the Hulk eats people.  It's the same quality as the other Marvel Knights releases I just don't think it was a very strong book to start.

I also wish they would give us some variation.  Of the 14 released stories 8 of them feature Wolverine and of those the latest 4 he is a main character.  From the Vs Sabertooth special features I gather they will be releasing a sequel to that so there's another one.  I like Wolverine but let's see some other characters.  This seems like the kind of medium you can do characters who aren't popular enough for a cartoon.  How about Moon Knight?  Iron Fist?  Hawkeye?  Punisher MAX? Hell I'd even settle for Old Man Logan.  At least that's a different style of Wolvie story.",1404086400,,1312,4.4411764705882355

5782329,5,B00D97DLYS,this is a awesome movie. the art work in this motion comic is amazing. and the story is awesome. hulk and wolverine are two of my favorite marvel superheroes and to see those two go at it was pretty cool. even thoug wolverine did not do much. and it was cool to see betty ross turn into a she-hulk.  the only thing I like about these hero vs hero movies is that they always fight over a misunderstanding and become allies at the end. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1398470400,,489,4.09375
5782330,3,B00D97DLYS,"The story was o.k. , but I can honestly say I really do not like the ultimate storyline.  The Hulk is not 20 ft. tall.  Wolverine, they make him pretty much indestructable and unable to die.  Come on, I like Wolfie toll, but that really is to much for me.  I paid 9 bucks for this, but my opinion, if I had to do it over, I would only get this item in the 5-6 dollar range.",1395619200,,373,3.8051948051948052

5782345,3,B00D97DLYS,"While I'm not a fan of Wolverine or the Hulk, I've enjoyed the Marvel Knights animation series. I felt this piece was enjoyable, yet the ending had me saying, ""that's it?""

5782350,2,B00D97DLYS,"About the only positive remark I have here is for the artwork. Leinel Francis Yu is indeed incredible at what he does. Apart from that it is pretty terrible. In my opinion, the story is terrible, the portrayal of Wolverine, Hulk/Banner, and Betty Ross is a bad joke, and the non-linear approach to telling the story was a little too chaotic to function as well as probably intended. I am usually fairly hesitant to sample stories outside of the Marvel norm, and this is a case where I should have trusted my instincts. If you want a better quality Someone VS. Hulk, go watch Hulk VS. Wolverine/Thor.",1381449600,,599,4.607476635514018

Strike two- this a story adapted from the Marvel Ultimates line of comics which generally speaking had few redeeming qualities between the different takes on time honored and much loved classic comic book characters in a vain attempt to make the characters more edgy and modern then slapping the label 'Ultimate' on it.",1440460800,,554,5.087912087912088
