3850916,5,B00264H48Y,I'm so thankful that this is finally on dvd!!!! I'm so glad this show is finally getting the respect it deserves!!! I will watch every episode over and over again! I just hope the other seasons become avaliable on dvd.,1246492800,,218,4.475
3850917,5,B00264H48Y,"I am VERY happy to have the second season of Rugrats. It didn't take me long to watch all of season 1 when I got it. Now, starting off with ""Toy Palace"", I am so overjoyed to be visiting my childhood! I haven't seen these episodes in years! Thank-you Amazon for bringing these nostalgic classics back to us 90's kids! I look forward to more releases and would LOVE to see at least up to season 5 of Rugrats!

Thanks again! Shipment was decent for the choice I chose and I will definitely buy more of these. Hey Arnold season 1 is next!",1244592000,,535,4.194174757281553
3850918,5,B00264H48Y,"As a child, I grew up watching ""Rugrats."" Naturally, now that it is on DVD, I am buying it not only for myself but for my little brothers to enjoy as well.

Overall, the picture has not been modified since being converted to DVD format. In this way, the audience is able to view the original colors/drawings. I would definitely recommend this to new and old fans alike just for the pure entertainment of watching a CARTOON rather than a teeny-bopper show that hints at content not actually suitable for children. All audiences will enjoy not only the creativity each character displays, but the childlike attitude they are able to maintain (i.e. Phil and Lil sharing food from their diapers). Enjoy!",1244419200,,699,4.776859504132231
3850919,5,B00264H48Y,"I've been a closet Rugrats fan for some time now and I'm so glad that Nickelodeon is finally giving this show the respect it deserves and putting it out onto DVD! Under normal circumstances I'd probably only rate it with four stars if it's being burnt onto discs that may only work on regular DVD players, but I've been waiting for these episodes to be released for so long now that I don't even care.

Season 2 of this awesome show is in my opinion probably the best batch of Rugrats episodes ever made. I will thoroughly enjoy watching all of them, but Chuckie vs The Potty, The Shot, and Susie vs Angelica will be what I watch first.

Not only are these episodes entertaining and funny, but they make nice lessons for both kids and adults. I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys watching cartoons!",1241827200,,814,4.493243243243243
3850920,5,B00264H48Y,"This is such a classic and defining show of the nineties, and while it's a shame to not see a proper release of the show on DVD, I'm glad for the opportunity to at least own the episodes in chronological order on these Amazon Made On Demand DVD-R's. This set collecting the first half of the second season contains the following 26 eleven minute long episodes from 1992-1993:

14  Toy Palace / Sand Ho
15  Chuckie Vs. The Potty / Together At Last
16  The Big House / The Shot
17  Showdown At Teeter-Totter Gulch / Mirrorland
18  Angelica's In Love / Ice Cream Mountain
19  Regarding Stuie / Garage Sale
20  Let There Be Light / The Bank Trick
21  Family Reunion / Grandpa's Date
22  No Bones About It / Beach Blanket Babies
23  Reptar On Ice / Family Feud
24  Superhero Chuckie / The Dog Broomer
25  Aunt Miriam / The Inside Story
26  A Visit From Lipschitz / What The Big People Do

Having now watched all the episodes on DVD I can say that the audio and video quality is not something you should be worried about when buying these Made On Demand sets. I am very uptight when it comes to the quality of the things I own and I can say that all the episodes were presented in the same, if not better than, quality they originally aired. My only issue as far as any of the Amazon Made On Demand sets is that being a purist I'd like the opening theme to play before every episode and not just the first one on each disc, but that's a very minor issue.

I personally had no issue playing the DVD-R type discs on any of my DVD player's or even on my Sony DVD Recorder. I have purchased several different Nickelodeon series (Doug, Hey Arnold & Rugrats) on Amazon 'MOD' sets now and had no issue with the picture or sound quality on any of them and they have all played fine on my DVD player's.

This set actually only contains half of the episodes from the complete second season of Rugrats. It contains thirteen half hour episodes but since each episode has two halves Amazon is counting each half as a full episode. Still these episodes are all classics and I'm happy to own any episodes of Rugrats on DVD. Now I'm just hoping that they'll release the rest of seasons 2-5 of the show on DVD.

I give five stars merely for the chance to own these episodes. Children's television was so much better in the nineties, thanks for your time.

*For those interested I have included summaries for the 26 eleven minute long episodes that are included in this set in my comments section to avoid cluttering up the review page.",1241308800,27,2512,4.295116772823779

3850952,5,B00264H48Y,I don't mean to write a review but has anyone seen the new listing for season 2 I'm wondering if it's the complete season. If you read the description very carefully they say it's the complete second season with All 26 episodes. Can someone get back at me about this,1400889600,,266,4.34
3850953,2,B00264H48Y,"When they showed that they had the whole season 2, I was very excited. I thought they redid it. They even showed that they were going to have 4 disc, and that all the episodes from season 2 were on there. It feels like I've been cheated. I had to cancell season 9, because even though it looked like that was going to be the complete season 9, I knew it was the best of before. The worst part is, I already donated my other best of season 2 DVD, so I can't send this one back. Thanks alot!!!",1400716800,,491,3.9696969696969697

3850990,4,B00264H48Y,i love that its on dvd but why only half a season not the entire thing. If they were going to do that why not a second dvd with the second half. Dont get me wrong im not gonna complain to much cause this is better than nothing but i really like the episodes the santa experience and meet the carmichaels which would be on the second half.,1387324800,,338,3.985294117647059

3850993,2,B00264H48Y,"I'm giving the Rugrats DVD series 2 stars as I feel it can cause some young children, like my daughter, to pick up on some negative character traits and make them their own thinking people will laugh since the show made it look funny. And her attitude greatly improved once I removed these DVDs.",1384905600,,295,4.481481481481482
3850994,1,B00264H48Y,"As the name ""Best of"" implies, there are episodes missing. It would be greatly appreciated if this could be updated as half the season is missing.",1379289600,2,146,4.653846153846154
3850995,5,B00264H48Y,"The only problem with this season is that it's not the whole season, but best of season 2.  That's my only disappointment with this one.",1368748800,,136,4.44
3850996,1,B00264H48Y,"I plan on buying every episode of the Rugrats because it's a show of my childhood and I hope to someday show my children the magic of this television show. I am so upset to see that there is no full season 2. It cuts the episodes of Rugrats Season 2 off right before the Christmas episode. Having a ""Best of"" DVD package really contradicts itself if it doesn't include the holiday specials of the season.

I wouldn't mind this product if there was a Season 2: Part Two or the whole season in it's entirety, but there isn't. My children won't be able to watch my favorite Nicktoon Christmas Special because it's not included. Heck, I'd buy this even if the whole season comes out at once. We only have this.

Please Amazon, release the rest of the season and I will buy this product. But until then, I will leave Season 2 (and Season 9) out of my collection. I can't stand having incomplete episodes.",1365465600,3,899,4.377245508982036
3850997,3,B00264H48Y,"They release the last half of season 2 (making a full set). I'm sure they have access to all of them, considering they have released so many other complete seasons of Nickelodeon shows (Danny Phantom, Fairly Oddparents,etc), so I'm sure it is only a matter of time, if more people demand it enough. I love the Rugrats and i wish to own every episode. I'm either going to have to buy a TON of VHS tapes then record them to DVD, or find a way to download from YouTube or somehow! They should also do the same for Rugrats: Best of Season 9. Again only missing about 4 episodes. Call it ""The Rest of Season 2"". As long as they can do it, and make money, I'm sure they will.",1361491200,,669,4.153846153846154
3851018,2,B00264H48Y,"Think about it for just a second. They're charging almost the exact same price as Season 3 and that has all of it's episodes whereas this one only has half. HALF. Amazon, if I were you, I'd seriously cut the price for this one. Unless you do decide to release the entire season, this thing needs to have it's cost pushed down to at least $17. Okay, I love Rugrats, I really do but if you're going to release a season set, make sure you release the whole thing. I can say the same thing about Rugrats Season 9 and Doug Season 4 (Which the only thing that made that one ""Best of"" is that they didn't add one episode. Yeah, I'm serious). So, Amazon, please don't screw over your customers and just give these season sets all of their episodes.",1352419200,,740,4.25531914893617
3851019,2,B00264H48Y,"I would really give two and a half stars and thats not to Amazon! That's to the creators of Rugrats! The show is of course awesome but only including HALF the season is not! Back when I first bought this item it didn't include ""Best of"" at all so I personally was misled... but what is also upsetting is that they didn't just carefully pick the ""best of"" season 2.... they just cut them right down the middle!... So it's the exact first half that is only on the dvd, not the second. The second half includes my most favorite episodes! (and yes the one that INTRODUCES SUSIE) How are you gonna leave that out of the ""best of"".... Shame on you Amazon....

I think its fine if they want to split them up and the price is fair but just release the second half! please :)??",1346889600,10,768,4.224489795918367
3851020,3,B00264H48Y,"I bought this DVD season for my girlfriend because she loved the Rugrats when she was younger and still does. I was a little disappointed that only half the season was there! I guess it was my fault for not reading entirely, but for all others, this is NOT the full season!",1342224000,,273,4.269230769230769
3851021,5,B00264H48Y,"Folks, Rugrats had 5 seasons of 13 episodes, not 1 season of 13 and 2 of 26 like the idiots on wikipedia organized it. Just because seasons 2 and 3, and later seasons 4 and 5, may have premiered in successive weeks before taking a break...that does _not_ mean that the two seasons become ONE season.

Most contracts for television shows are for seasons of 13 episodes (in other words, covering one quarter of a year taken at one new episode per week), and Rugrats, like the other Nicktoons, functioned in just this way. They may have had two completed seasons ready for Nickelodeon in the fall of 1992 and 1993 (I can't even verify these original airdates, though, so who even knows if that part of the wikipedia list is accurate), but their contract was for 5 seasons of 13 episodes.

That's why amazon put out only the first 13 episodes/26 stories you see listed on wikipedia - because those are season 2. The next 13 are season 3. The next 13 are season 4. And the last 13 of the original 65 were season 5.

Use some common sense.",1340496000,,1033,4.397905759162303
3851022,3,B00264H48Y,"I LOVE Rugrats, so when I got this as a present for Christmas a couple years back, I was ECSTATIC. However, it has been brought to my attention that not ALL of the episodes are present. What gives, Amazon? I'm still in love with my DVD set, but it would only make sense for Amazon to release ""part 2,"" or re-release the DVD set. WE'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. Same with Season 9. Come on Amazon... Please?",1339718400,3,403,4.17948717948718

They are, The Big House and Showdown on Teeter-Tooter Gulch. I will be building up my Rugrats collection some more.",1334707200,,370,4.537313432835821
3851024,1,B00264H48Y,"Just like Nickelodeon to take the best season of the best franchise that was created for their channel and not even give it a proper ""season"" release. In an era of full season releases and full seasons readily available on the internet, it seems odd they won't even release all the episodes for their seasons on Itunes or Netflix...Makes one wonder where they stand financially.",1330992000,2,378,4.8307692307692305

3851026,1,B00264H48Y,"This is terrible. According to other reviews, this set contains only HALF of the complete second season of Rugrats. Now that Amazon has released all seasons of Rugrats, all 9 seasons, this issue needs to be resolved. I urge all Rugrats fans to avoid purchasing any Rugrats seasons from Amazon until they reissue the complete second season and release the remaining episodes from season 9 (currently it is released as a ""Best Of"" set). I am excited that Amazon has gone to great lengths to release all the seasons, but to leave out just a few episodes and forget about it is simply unacceptable! So until Amazon releases the complete Season 2 and Season 9, I will not purchase any of these sets, and I hope everyone else will do the same. If/When this gets resolved, I will purchase them all and replace these reviews with 5 star reviews! Thank you.

January 2012 UPDATE: Wow. What an unbelievable blow to Amazon's customers. Here we have been writing to them and posting in these reviews that we want the complete season 2 and complete season 9 to be released. For me, I will not purchase any seasons until the complete series is available in its entirety. Instead of coming to their senses and releasing the remaining episodes, they slap ""the best of"" on Season 2. Basically, this shows that, in all likelihood, they don't have the intention to release the remaining episodes. I just think this is very unprofessional and extremely selfish on their part if they want to turn a profit on these. I WILL NOT BUY ANY RUGRATS SEASON DVDS FROM AMAZON UNLESS THEY RELEASE THE COMPLETE SERIES! THIS IS TERRIBLE! I URGE ALL OF YOU TO AVOID PURCHASING THIS SEASON AND WRITE TO AMAZON THAT YOU WANT THE FULL SEASON! WHY PAY FULL PRICE FOR HALF A SEASON?! OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!

May 2014 UPDATE: Well, it looks like maybe this review and messages to Amazon have finally paid off! The second season product information, as well as season 9, have been updated. They now state that season 2 and season 9 are complete in their entirety, thereby making all 9 seasons of Rugrats available by Amazon on DVD the true complete collection of Rugrats! Wow! How awesome is that? Well, it gets better because at the time of this update, the prices are cut nearly in half for all seasons, making them very affordable! Before I change my review to a 5-star for this product, I am going to order every single season once they are all in stock and make sure everything is perfect. I am beyond excited right now!",1319328000,44,2479,4.619047619047619

When I say episode again I am talking about each time the title comes up, not the theme song.  Now I would have expected some second set of dvds for the second half of season two but I also then expect seasons 3-9 to be comming out soon. Since a large amount of ppl bought these dvds they would buy the others.

About the actual dvds, great condition and the picture is of better quality than when suited on tv. I am very pleased with them other than mentioned above. I watch them all the time",1312588800,,610,4.127118644067797

It's not his first choice of something to watch, but he does like it.

I do get a kick out of walking into the living room with the Rugrat's movie playing and witnessing my daughters and their 20-23 year old friends watching the movie while my grandson is asking them to go on EBAY and buy Batman Legos for him!

3851080,5,B00264H48Y,"Great! I just got it and love it! It said it was going to be DVD-R but it was not (Which was good). A lot of you are complaining it's only half a season but its FOUR HOURS of Rugrats. They have to make another set because it would've been like six discs, so give Amazon Credit. Plus a lot of people are complaining about no special features, and no music/video menu. I like it, it takes you back to the glory days when you got all the Rugrats VHS's. So I'd give this 5 out of 5 stars. Some of the best episodes! Thanks Amazon/Nickelodeon! I love this!",1264118400,,551,4.064220183486238
3851081,4,B00264H48Y,"I've watched almost this whole set and it's been good quality, and it was in good condition. It's exactly the same as I remember it on Nickelodeon. As someone said earlier though, this DVD set is just the shows and nothing else like a normal series release would be. But the important thing is the shows are good. The only complaint I have is that...this is not all of season 2! This is actually half of Season 2. I'm hoping they're going to release a second half of season 2, because that's only fair. Still, I must say I've really enjoed the disk, and it was worth the money. It's rugrats in their prime, when the plots were still good and they didn't add a bunch of lame characters or new animation. I'm looking forward to the second half of season 2 and then season 3!",1262649600,2,772,4.294520547945205

The quality of the DVD's are awesome and when I'm watching them I feel like a seven year old all over again! A must buy!!!,1261872000,,299,3.838709677419355
3851083,5,B00264H48Y,"one of the best shows for kids i grew up with it and wish to pass it on to future generations however i wish it was a proper dvd release not on a recorded dvd i hope to see the future seasons properly released in stores and reasonably priced,the $35 asking price exclusively for an amazon release is uncalled for especially since there are no special features and the fact on episode on tv consist of two segments and this release counts each segment as it's own episode, despite the corporate rip-off the series is too special too pass up and i do recommend it. I also recommend that people request a proper reasonably priced release from nickelodeon.",1259625600,2,652,4.533898305084746
3851084,3,B00264H48Y,"The description claims that ""all 26 episodes of season 2"" are provided in this set. However, this is not the case. Only the first 13 episodes of season 2 (26 ""half"" episodes) come in this set. This is quite disappointing since they say the complete season is included. $32 for half a season is pretty steep.

I love these amazon Nick exclusives, because it gets me my fix of old nick toons. I hope they continue to release more! However, amazon needs to get their seasons and descriptions right.

This would get 5 FULL STARS if it was the COMPLETE season. I will give it 3 stars since HALF the season is MISSING!",1254182400,25,612,4.407079646017699
3851085,4,B00264H48Y,"Hi there! In this review I'll mostly be talking about the differences between this season and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rugrats-Season-1-3-Disc-Set/dp/B00264H48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rugrats Season 1 (3 Disc Set)</a>, If you want to read my opinions on the DVD quality, check out my review on the first season, because the quality is the same for both seasons.

Anyway, after watching both seasons, I can say that Season 2 is the better of the two seasons currently available at the time of writing this review. The animation here is much more fluid, whereas the animation of Season 1 is clearly showing its age, especially when you compare the first season and some of the more recent Rugrats episodes. This is not the fault of Amazon's release, but part of the natural development of the series when it originally aired. If you're just starting you or your kids out with Rugrats, I highly recommend you pick up Season 2 first. Not only is the animation better, but I feel like Season 2's episodes are more consistently entertaining, while there are only a few episodes from Season that I loved. Also, Rugrats is one of those shows where you can watch any episode and immediately acquaint yourself with the characters and what's going on, because each episode is its own unique adventure.

Some of my favorite episodes from this set include 'Ice Cream Mountain', 'Garage Sale', 'No Bones About It', 'Aunt Miriam', and 'What the Big People Do'. All being said, I enjoy watching Rugrats no matter what episode is playing (in other words, there is no ""clunker"" episode in either of the two seasons), because it's such a clever and entertaining series, and I enjoy it as much as I did when I was younger. It's a great show to watch together as a family - it sparks the imagination in a child, and at the same time can put a smile on anyone, adult or child.

I rate this set at 4.5 stars, slightly better than the first season (which I rated at 4) because this set has more episodes I personally enjoy, and the animation is improved. It would be perfect if it had some form of special features, or was released on regular DVD's, but otherwise this is a solid release of one of my favorite animated series. Although these episodes are nearly seventeen years old, Rugrats is a timeless series, and I'm thankful to have the opportunity to revisit the memories I've had with the series. I hope that Nickelodeon continues to release more of these sets for Rugrats and all of their classic shows, and I'm glad that they haven't forgotten their fans from the nineties!",1248825600,,2612,4.878378378378378
3851086,5,B00264H48Y,"This is still one of my favorite shows. I really miss the old Nickelodeon, because the new Nickelodeon is a bunch of crap with all of the Icarley and other things! I wish the old Nickelodeon would come back. When we would wake up in the morning with our favorite Nicktoons like Rugrats, Doug, ect. The old Nickelodeon was a lot more fun to watch back then. My best idea would be... if there was a channel called Nick Rewind, it would play all of the old Nickelodeon shows we all know and love!

3851087,5,B00264H48Y,"My family and I have been watching Rugrats since it first started, and we were delighted to find Amazon.com selling these made-to-order DVD sets of the first two seasons of the show. All the episodes are tremendously funny and entertaining and are presented nicely on three DVDs in their respective order of broadcasting. My only complaint with the second season is that only half of the season 2 episodes are present here in this first installment; hopefully Amazon will release the second half soon; but otherwise, it's a great investment and well worth the money.",1247097600,,566,4.968421052631579
