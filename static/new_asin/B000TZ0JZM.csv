2911995,5,B000TZ0JZM,This is a very good dvd and one you may want to show your friends. There is a lot of information in the dvd and I don't know if there is a book containing the same information. Mike knows his subject very well and it is definitely worth the money.,1254009600,8,247,3.96
2911996,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Regardless who engineered ""911,"" it's become clear over the years that the tragedy quickly became a means to an end.  Mike Ruppert, like most others who have investigated aspects of ""911,"" concludes that American hegemony in Eurasia, and particularly in the Middle East, was that end.  But there's another, a much subtler means to an end contained within ""The Truth and Lies of 911"" - one of Ruppert's own making.  And everything he says about ""911"" leads to that end. He's obsessed with a presumed CIA connection to the international drug trade; he was an LAPD narcotics detective who was driven from the Police Department because he made waves about that very thing.  So, even though he understandably concludes that ""911"" became a means of capturing Middle Eastern oil, natural gas and pipeline routes, he's just as adamant that ""911"" was also a means of re-capturing the Afghanistani opium trade - which the Taliban virtually eliminated.  It is Ruppert's belief that the profits from this drug trade is primarily what keeps the American economy from collapsing.  In fact, his comments on the economy are the most compelling part of the entire two and a half hour presentation; and his brief introductory comments - which date from 2004 - are eerily prescient.  It's as if he's giving a news report on the recent banking crisis.  That alone earns this film at least five-stars - and helps counter-balance what might otherwise be written off as merely a personal vendetta against the CIA.",1253750400,63,1490,4.932
2911997,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Mike Ruppert is informative, precise and presents a picture that every thinking american needs to make an informed decision about foreign policy, congressman and a global worldview.  Peek oil, 9/11 truthers, conspiratorial i.e. Cheneys energy policy and of course the Patriotic Act I, II and III the victory acts that have since been passed.  All Americans need to review this material because it connects wall street and drugs.  Gold, oil and Drugs.",1245110400,29,450,5.222222222222222
2911998,5,B000TZ0JZM,"On the subject of 9-11, it is hard to go past Mike Ruppert for information. Being a former cop, he knows that in order to convince people of what he is saying, you need to talk facts and evidence, and that's exactly what he does. In this lecture given in late November of 2001, he doesn't give opinions on how 9-11 was pulled off, because, even to this day, it is still speculation. But what Mike Ruppert presents is solid evidence proving the official lies and contradictions that lead to the event, and he builds an impeccable case as to why it happened. Tying in drug trafficking, money laundering, oil (especially peak-oil) and gas as well as wall street, the CIA and the desperate financial plunder of the US, the how of the 9-11 operation, while remaining a fascinating question (and only that, thanks to the official resistance to a proper investigation), takes on less credence to prove complicity and guilt. I am amazed at how many questions this lecture answers and how much information is present at such an early point in the 9-11 investigation. But then again, as Ruppert so ably represents, the operation itself was going on a long time before the actual event. Read Ruppert's ""Crossing the Rubicon"" for more detailed and updated information. And, as a speaker, he's pretty watchable, and even some of his jokes aren't bad. If you want to know the why framed by the solid, hard facts, watch this, it really could change your life.",1243382400,93,1444,4.688976377952756

Much of this video is not about 9/11 but about corruption in the government, control of oil, and drug trafficking in the CIA that may have lead to it.

2912017,3,B000TZ0JZM,"The publicity material tempted me to purchase this DVD.

Upon receiving it and viewing it I was interested in the details, but disappointed in the quality of the video production and the repetition in the presentation.

This topic is an important story to be told and deserves better treatment. That being said perhaps those with the money did not want to contribute to the production costs and so the production was made within the available budget to get the story out..

If this documentary movie can be remade to a higher quality of production and with tighter editing, it will attract and hold he attention of more viewers.

Mike Ruppert deserves our thanks for telling his side of this story from an insider's perspective.

2912022,5,B000TZ0JZM,"When Detective (ret.) Mike Ruppert tells his story of conspiracies in the Government and it's departments, we should all sit up and take notice.
It has long been known about the CIA dealing in drugs (Vietnam - Air America etc), and it is foolish to believe things have changed when there is so much money to be made. The power in drugs is unequaled.
The official story of 9-11 is much the same, in that it has long been known that governments deal in lies and killings for their own benefit.  'Operation Northwoods' comes to mind.  Nothing is beneath or above our governments, and we should listen to those know, not those who seek to pervert the truth and obfuscate the facts.

2912027,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Since the recent 9/11 anniversary and the September 10, 2012 NY Times article entitled ""The Deafness Before the Storm"" by Kurt Eichenwald, I've revisited a few documentaries on the subject.  Most of them are either so amateurishly done that they are hard to take seriously or they don't answer enough of the right questions.  This one is different.  Anyone who has read ""Crossing the Rubicon"" by Mike Ruppert or who has followed him over the years will have a good idea of what they're getting in ""The Truth and Lies of 9/11.""  A former Los Angeles Police Detective with a great analytical mind, a good memory and the willingness to sit down, read and think, Mike Ruppert pieces together information that (IMO) would make any reasonably thinking person's jaw drop.  He easily sources his information because it's all public.  There are neither top secret documents that only he is privy to nor are there any `deep throats' that lurk behind dark corners (lol).  All of the info he sources any of us could gain access to if we were so inclined to look for it.

This is not a flashy, tabloid-esque video -- -- it is a lecture at a university, so please do not let the cover or the somewhat crude quality of the video dissuade viewing.  In my opinion, the information in this documentary is ghastly though important.  Whatever you make of if it is up to you; just keep in mind the following statement while watching:  from the Groucho and Chico Marx silent movie Duck Soup, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?""",1347667200,4,1522,4.6
2912028,1,B000TZ0JZM,This cover on the DVD box is decieving.  This is a classroom lecture presentation i wished i had returned it but i waited too long to open it.  I was very dissapointed,1329955200,3,167,4.1875
2912029,5,B000TZ0JZM,"In these past years I've come to realize there is wide spread ignorance amongst the voting majority, much to the benefit of the special interests who change our lawmakers and elected officials from being our lawmakers to being their lawmakers. We continue to render to our elected officials a trust that has been proven unworthy. For example, NPR (Natioonal public radio) exposed the ALEC Corporation and how this nation-wide organization has repeatedly influenced our lawmakers across the country. NPR exposed Senator Pierce of Arizona and his effort to do the bidding of the corporation contracted to house criminals in Arizona. 36 co-sponsors in Arizona herded in support of Pierce's illegal immigration bill, 30 of these co-sponsors received campaign contributions from the prison authority. Go to NPR's website for complete details.

I recently viewed a movie narrated by Matt Damon titled, ""Inside Job."" Many politicians and university professors were specifically mentioned and how their influencial positions were mangled by greed and what riches were bestowed upon them. Consulting fees and campaign contributions were carefully detailed. Derivative were described such as credit default swaps (CDO) where by banking institutions sold bundles of subprime mortgages to investment houses and then took insurance out with AIG betting the loans they sold would fail.

We all remember 9/11, but how many of us knew the day before 9/11/2001? On Sept 10, 2001 Rumsfeld had a news conference and claimed there were trillions of tax payer money alloted to our defense budget and was misplaced. Search U-tube with Rumsfeld, Sept 10, 2001 to see for yourself. ""Follow the money"" might be a helpful hint to help explain who may have been the conspirators of 9/11. Jesse Ventura narrated and was featured in a conspiracy theory sponsored by TruTV that was quickly stifled in its distribution and viewing. Jesse Ventura claimed the paper trail for finding where these hundreds of billions and perhaps trillions of dollars went was housed in that part of the Pentagon hit by the alleged terrorists via an alleged plane. Could terrorists be that lame in destroying the one part of the Pentagon with the most evidence against any wrongful acts of corruption and greed by the Pentagon?

George Ball, the undersecretary to JFK in the 1960's wrote a book titled ""The Passionate Attachment."" This book careful details  many atrocities committed by Israel such as the infamous traiter Jonathon Pollard, the purposeful attack of the USS Liberty to conceal cease fire violations and the complete massacre of Deir Yassin. Much of this history was not simply forgotten by the American voter, since was never known. Our blind support for another country and lack of balance should not be tolerated any longer. One can only wonder what is the ""present day"" value of all the gifts rendered to Israel over the past fifty years and how much of this wealth filtered back to our politicians to make them someone else's politician instead of ours. Amother book worthy of your library was written by John Mearsheimer and titled, ""The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy."" It is a more comprehensive read of foreign lobbying efforts manipulating our lawmakers and the Pentagon who then exert pressures on others such as our previous Secretary of State Colin Powell and his effort to refrain Israel. Most certainly, Bush Jr was no Eisenhower.

When the majority of American voters rise up by learning facts and history there's a better likelihood our vote will be for the elected official who might become or remain OUR elected official and not that of the private interests and lobbyists. There should be a thorough investigation of what really happened on 9/11, not the 911 Commission which was given limited resources, time frame and specifics by the Bush Administration on what NOT to investigate. There should be an investigation of all monies collected directly/indirectly by elected officials from sources they were meant to oversee in their respective oversight committees. Surely this practice of corruption is wide-spread within our government.

One day there will be a more organzied effort to keep the facts straight. It will be a day when there's more of us with a quench for knowledge and facts and no longer satisfied by cleverly contrived campaign rhetoric and TV host opinions by those more similar in their knowledge base to your pet cat than to Noam Chomsky. This futuristic voting majority will no longer be satisfied with a spin on events and easily contrived story lines so to confuse. I congratulate and applaud every one of you seeking to learn and embrace what they choose to believe, based on facts. There's no one of us who could be right 100% of the time but as a majority we will become a force to be reckoned with, essential to protect our future. Confuscious say....""only the wisest and stupidest of men never change."" Perhaps that could go for the American voter as well. I want to believe that.",1327276800,4,5000,5.061893203883495

2912040,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Michael Ruppert has the contacts to keep him aware of the secret plots that are being carried out against the American people and the rest of the world.
This video points out the relationship between drug dealing, arms trading, the CIA, Wall Street and some of the biggest companies in the United States, not to mention the put options on American Airlines and United Airlines that were over 6 times higher than normal, and the put options on World Trade Center companies Merrill Lynch & Co., and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.,  that were 12 times higher and 26 times higher than usual, respectively.
The people best in position to buy these put options had ties to Deutsche Bank, and were currently in the CIA, though some could also have been Wall Street bankers (kept informed by their CIA buddies).
Investors have yet to collect more than $15 million in profits they made on put options from 9/11.  They're guilty of the most criminal type of insider trading, ever.
No wonder the investigation stopped short of finding the people who had attempted to profit using their foreknowledge of the planned 9/11 ""attacks"".",1268179200,8,1121,4.803108808290156
2912041,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Anyone trying to make sense of the 9/11 mystery should look at Mike Ruppert's work.

It was not until I first watched this dvd, that things started to fit into place.  Instead of going through the events of 9/11, he gives us a detailed analysis of how the Banks, Government, CIA and Corporations all work together for their own financial gain.  Mike then shows us how 9/11 was needed to continue their hunger for global power, control of oil and further personal wealth.

Over the years M.R. has carried out painstaking research, so when he presents his information it is fully sourced and documented.  The Government can usually get away with their crimes as people are not willing or able to find the evidence, however M.R. produces many documents that show corruption at the highest level.

This film is important as it gives you a better understanding why the US government would carry out such a wicked act on its own people. He shows us compelling evidence they were planning the attacks long before 9/11 and to what ends.

It is quite uncomfortable to think that the people you elect to serve your interests can do such a thing, so it can be quite hard viewing. I think the misguided loyalty to our leaders is stopping us looking for the dark truths, and until we can change, the Government will keep getting away with it.

Until we get to the truth of 9/11, the Government will use it to justify any actions they see fit.

Therefore we should never stop demanding a new and honest investigation.",1267401600,30,1503,4.620300751879699
8211482,5,B000TZ0JZM,"Mike Ruppert uses the government's OWN documents to show:

1) the CIA runs drugs and guns for profit to fund their illicit activities (and those of their big-banker friends who launder it)
2) the Fed govt's solution to the impending catastrophe of Peak Oil is to seize the mid-east oil states by military force
3) Sept. 11, 2001, brought to you by R. Cheney and G.W. Bush, was the ""New Pearl Harbor"" used to spark that solution into action
