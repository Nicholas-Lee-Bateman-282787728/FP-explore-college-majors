2703216,4,B000LC5B7O,"The ad campaign for Barry Levinson's ""Man of the Year"" asks: What would happen if a comedian ran for the Presidency and won? That's a good question, especially if it's apparent that the comedian is the only candidate willing to address America's toughest issues. Such is the case with Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a cable talk show host whose comedic personality isn't exactly a way to get laughs so much as it's a way for the public to understand how ridiculous the political system is. And it seems to be working; during one of his pre-show warm-ups, an audience member casually suggests that he should run for President. Instead of pushing the idea aside, he begins a fast-paced, humorous excursion into the world of politics. But there's more to ""Man of the Year"" than humor; it's a clever, thought provoking satire that effectively puts American democracy under the microscope for close examination.

This film was perfectly timed. We live in an age where political comedians such as Jon Stewart and Bill Mahr ask the tough questions about American politics, the ones that truly matter. What exactly does this say about our culture? Can we no longer rely on the people we elect to ask the tough questions? Despite a straightforward story with clear message, Levinson doesn't try to give definitive answers; rather, he puts the issues out in the open, in turn allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions. I found this refreshing, especially since the plot involves a couple of events that can be viewed both positively and negatively. Consider Dobbs during the Presidential debate; his conduct is unruly, ranting and raving without letting the other candidates have their say. A man of such low impulse control may be too intense to represent the American public.

But at the same time, he's also getting to the heart of the matter by bringing to light the issues average person truly cares about. To make sure his ideas stick, he includes generous doses of humor (in the traditional Robin Williams fashion of hyperactive adlibbing). His speeches always end in energetic rounds of applause, which his staff finds encouraging. His managers--the ailing Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) and the cynical Eddie Langston (Lewis Black)--are especially involved; they watches over Dobbs' career with intense care, always quick to discuss possible career moves. When Dobbs decides to run for office, Menken and Langston are the first to push for an edgier, funnier, more honest campaign, free from the typical political rhetoric the Democrats and Republicans are known for (such as thanking their families and the public for their unwavering support).

At the same time all this is being established, a high-end technology firm called Delacroy Systems is introduced. They've created a highly advanced electronic voting booth, one that operates by means of touching a computer screen. It seems simple enough; all the voter has to do is select the ""Yes"" or ""No"" button for each candidate. The only person who takes issue with this new system is Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), a computer tech for Delacroy. She discovers a glitch when performing a systems test, one that inexplicably alters the end result. Attempts to bring it to the company's attention are first ignored, and then as Election Day arrives, they're treated as an attack. The head of the company--Alan Stewart (Jeff Goldblum)--considers Eleanor a major threat; not only will exposing the truth about the voting machines undermine the democratic system, it will also put a serious dent in the financial future of Delacroy Systems.

This is when things start getting complicated. It's through this new electronic system that Dobbs wins the race for presidency, which is just as baffling as it is exciting. A comedian has been elected as the leader of the free world; what are the odds of that happening, even in a country that seems to want drastic change? Eleanor knows that something is wrong, and she intends to find out exactly what. Unfortunately, her zeal is getting her in serious trouble with Delacroy, specifically with Stewart. He goes to great lengths to keep her quiet, all of which involve ruining her reputation (without getting too specific, one involves drugs). Desperate to get to the truth, she has no choice but to track down Dobbs and personally appeal to him. What follows is an interesting if strained relationship. Eleanor initially walks on eggshells when in Dobbs' presence, afraid that he's unwilling to accept what she has to say. What makes the situation even more complicated is that Delacroy is on to her, turning her into a paranoid wreck. If she intends to clear her name and expose a corrupt corporation, she has to convince Dobbs that she isn't an insane, obsessive lunatic.

I initially wondered what this subplot had to do with Dobbs' political adventure. It didn't seem like something that could mesh with a commentary on American democracy, especially since that part of the story was much more humorous. But as I thought about it, I realized that it fit perfectly; Delacroy Systems is a corporation that thrives on the status quo, and it refuses to let anyone disrupt the social climate by revealing the truth. As odd as it may seem, I think Levinson was trying to say that the American government operates in much the same way. Tom Dobbs is a man who made a living by mocking the actions of his government. Now he's become part of the government, and he intends to disrupt the social climate by changing the status quo.

Can anyone handle such a change? Was the American public actually ready for a comedian to be elected President? By the time Dobbs makes a surprise appearance on the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch ""Weekend Update,"" these questions weigh heavily on his mind (as do thoughts of Eleanor, whose situation is getting more and more serious). What an interesting way to tell such a satirical story; I admired Barry Levinson for choosing to tackle such a delicate subject as the American government. ""Man of the Year"" forces you to reexamine everything you ever thought about democracy, politics, and representation. Considering the age we live in, I'd say it's about time.",1161129600,5,6186,4.977756286266924
2703217,2,B000LC5B7O,"Have you ever thought about what might happen if Jon Stewart, host of His own popular Comedy Central television show taking a daily, critical look at the news and politics, ran for President of the United States? Well, you don't need to. Writer/ director Barry Levinson (""Wag the Dog"", ""Rainman"", ""Tin Men"") has done the thinking for you in his new film ""Man of the Year"" starring Robin Williams.

Tom Dobbs (Williams), star of a popular comedy show taking a critical look at daily news and politics, announces he is going to run for President of the United States. An audience member makes the suggestion during the warm up and everyone in the studio goes nuts. The irreverent comedian decides to make the announcement, more as a joke, but before he can whistle the Star Spangled Banner, he is on the ballot in 13 states and criss crossing the country in a campaign bus. His longtime manager (Christopher Walken) and writer (Lewis Black) both feel he needs to let loose and take advantage of his moment in the spotlight, but Dobbs feels he must remain serious and discuss the issues. Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), a programmer at a large computer company who manufactured the electronic tolling booths, realizes there is an error with the program. Her bosses turn a deaf ear; if she is right, the profits will plummet. Eleanor decides to try to contact the President-Elect and they form a friendship that gradually grows into something more significant. But will she be able to tell him he didn't actually win the election? And if so, what will he do?

""Man of the Year"" contains a few of William's trademark riffs, but the film is, more or less, a drama. This is not necessarily a bad thing, even though the film is being marketed as a comedy. What is more disappointing is that the film doesn't go far enough to take a critical look at the politics or news of the day.

Imagine if you were watching ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" and he started telling a mix of standard jokes, not related to the daily politics or news. It wouldn't be very interesting. ""Man of the Year"" suffers from the same problem.

Williams is allowed to do a few of his comedic rants; during a segment set at his television show, during a televised debate with the Democratic President and his Republican running mate, but the jokes are extremely vague. Dobbs talks about education, same sex marriage, flag burning and more. Sure, these are topics we are concerned with, but his jokes aren't specific, they only address the issues in a vague way. Nothing about the War in Iraq, the Hurricane Katrina debacle, congressional scandals, lobbyist scandals, etc. Because Dobbs is rather vague, and Dobbs is the centerpiece of the film, the film is also vague.

The one point when the film makes anything close to a pointed barb at politics is during the televised debate. Both the Democratic President running for reelection and the Republican Senator running against him are spouting the same buzzwords, talking about how similar they are. Sound familiar? Now, if Levinson had really wanted to take this home, they would talk about ""Lock Boxes"", but he doesn't go that far. There is a nice moment during the debate when the Republican Senator is caught on camera during Dobbs tirade. The Senator realizes he is on camera, and just smiles, trying to win votes.

""Man of the Year"" is interesting and amusing for the first thirty minutes or so, when Dobbs is still a television personality and running for the Presidency. But when Dobbs begins his campaign, he addresses the public in all seriousness. Both Menken (Walken) and Eddie (Lewis Black) implore him to cut loose, use the few moments he has to get the people thinking. But he takes the campaign very seriously and bores the public. Unfortunately, he bores us in the process. Only during the debate does he really cut loose.

The film also includes a lengthy and distracting subplot about the company behind the Electronic Polling Places. Early in the film, Eleanor (Linney), runs some tests on the computer model. Every time she votes for the Republican Senator, the President still wins. She brings up the problem to her supervisors, including the company President who tells her it isn't important. Then, when Dobbs joins the race, she realizes he will win the election in the states he is on the ballot. A couple of times, the film shows Eleanor placed in danger, as part of the conspiracy. But this does nothing for the film's politics. It takes time away from the main story, that of an irreverent comedian running for President, and telling the people what they need to hear, which means there is less time for the candidate to actually say anything about the political system.

Also, this storyline seems like something more at home in a film based on a John  Grisham or David Balducci book. But in those films, you would not have Williams playing a television comedian running for President. You would have Gene Hackman or David Straitharn playing the Presidential candidate, without the jokes.

Because of all of this unnecessary, extra stuff, the film loses focus. Real fast.

Then, when Eleanor tries to tell Dobbs what she has learned, she becomes charmed by him. Thus, we have another subplot, involving their romance. Will she be able to tell him what happened? What will happen if she does?

When Christopher Walken is in a film, you can expect at least a little oddball goofiness. He has a couple of monologues, but his character is quickly taken out of the picture and he becomes a background fixture, appearing only briefly throughout.

Lewis Black, normally very acerbic on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"", seems to have been cast to simply sit around and laugh at William's few jokes.

""Man of the Year"" is even more disappointing when you consider the other films Barry Levinson has directed. But let's just consider this film with ""Wag the Dog"". There is no comparison. ""Wag"" had something to say about our current preoccupation with media and politics. ""Man"" has nothing to say about anything pressing right now. I have heard that, perhaps, this was done to prevent the film from becoming dated. Then why not have Dobbs rail against the pathetic voter turnout in our country, our apathetic view towards politics, something that is chronically wrong with our system. Because the film attempts to address some particularly vague ideas, it doesn't successfully capture our attention or move us to action.",1161043200,17,6456,4.809738503155996
2703218,5,B000LC5B7O,"A funny movie that reflects people's general feeling of disgust with today's political system.  No matter what political party you belong to, if any, you will love this movie.  Robin Williams stars as a comedian/talk-show host who campaigns as an independent candidate for President because he's tired of both Democrats and Republicans and wants to give America an alternative choice.  He becomes Ross Perot on speed.  I sat through this movie thinking ""I might vote for this guy"" and, when the movie ended in the theater, people actually stood up and applauded indicating how it was hitting home.

2703274,5,B000LC5B7O,"Alas, this film first serves to remind us of how much was lost when Robin Williams left us. As for the plot and acting - just wonderful, though as usual the villains could have been better. Robin's a comedian who specializes in political satire. One day he crosses the line and not only makes fun of the politicians, but also points out why they're so dysfunction - selling their souls to donors. Anyway, he becomes a serious candidate - and WINS!

Meanwhile, the lovely leading lady (Lauren Linney) is hard at work product managing a line of voting machines. She suspects there's a bug in the software, corporate doesn't want to do anything about it, and her conscience is then eating at her after the unexpected Williams victory.

So Williams is 'in' (and shouldn't be), and she is 'out' (fired for refusing to squelch her concerns). More skullduggery by her employer, a chase scene, and at the end they're both 'out of a job,' then work together, and end up married

2703275,3,B000LC5B7O,"The wonderful cast cannot pull off the ludicrous premise, * Spoiler alert * i.e. that a voting machine company would not test its software in any way before a presidential election and that the company management is so corrupt they become murderous thugs when the error is revealed.  We are to believe that no county clerks tested the software either.  I just happened to watch Robin Williams' 2009 Weapons of Self-Destruction the night before watching Man of the Year.  I was surprised at how many jokes were recycled from this movie for the standup routine.  I was also surprised that ""We are not red states and blue states; we are the United States"" came from this movie and not originally from Obama.  Dobbs' running for office is a very short part of the movie, but after that it seemed like the voting software revelation and subsequent coverup dragged on way too long.",1474070400,,875,4.730263157894737

Williams in this movie plays a comedian who speaks to the power brokers as a normal person. He makes fun of them and their lies, he points out their hypocrisy and somehow he gets elected. I can only PRAY that the same outcome happens with Trump as he points out the lies and corruption of the DC power brokers and specifically Hillary Clinton who is a main cog in the machine of DC corruption, owned and operated by special interest lobbyists. This movie speaks to the fact we need to reboot our system as it's been destroyed by criminals who somehow lie to gullible morons enough to get a vote from them.

2703314,4,B000LC5B7O,"Released in 2006, this Robin Williams vehicle, narrated by Christopher Walken, is prophetic!

It mentions how most people have started getting their news from comedians such as Jay Leno; Jon Stewart became the most trusted man in news when the pinko who helped us lose Viet Nam, Walter Kronkite, finally ""punched out.""  From there, it explores what would happen if a stand-up comedian such as the fictional Tom Dobbs, played by Robin, were to run for the Oval Office.

Mr. Dobbs decides to run, and spends no money on TV ads, yet (SPOILER ALERT!) he wins!

This is essentially what has happened with Donald Trump. He is thought of as a comedian with a bad comb-over, yet he is winning a bid for the U.S. Presidency, spending a small percentage of what his losing competitors are spending on ads.

The only reason I'm docking this film a star is that Robin's jokes are unnecessarily vulgar, and some of them even went over my head.

SPOILER ALERT!  Mr. Dobbs falls in love with a young, blonde lady who convinces him that a computer glitch in the system designed to prevent hanging chads from holding democracy hostage, caused Mr. Dobbs to win even though he should have lost, and he resigns.",1467936000,,1191,4.669856459330144

2703346,5,B000LC5B7O,"Barry Levinson wrote and directed this 2006 political thriller/satire about a political talk show host's run for the U.S. Presidency, and his relationship with a computer analyst that results from it.
  Tom Dobbs( Robin Williams, the actual great-grandson of a Mississippi Governor, and one-time Political Science major, in a  role filled with his usual comedic schtick) hosts a comedy talk show in which he routinely  addresses the American public's frustration  with both of the major political parties.
  A woman in his audience( Zoe Doyle) suggests  that he run for the Presidency, and while Dobbs is bemused by the idea, an online grassroots campaign to have him as a viable Independent candidate begins, and he obliges.
  His opponents are the incumbent President Kellogg(David Nichols) and the Republican Senator Mills(David Ferry).
  Eleanor Green( Laura Linney) works at a voting machine company called Delacroy, whose machines  will be used in the election nationwide. She notices an error in the voting system, but head of Delacroy, James Hemmings( Rick Roberts) ignores her repeated warnings because such news would cost his company  many investors.
  During the debate between the candidates, Dobbs presents some comedic schtick, but wins supporters when he makes many valid points on the issues.
 On Election Day, as Eleanor monitors the votes, Dobbs appears to have won, but Eleanor is the only one who realizes his ""victory"" is a mistake. She must find a way to at least reach Tom , who now must deal with another emergency involving his gruff manager, Jack Menken (Christopher Walken, who narrates the story) who is stricken with emphysema.
 A Delacroy executive named Stewart( Jeff Goldblum) joins Hemmings in trying to silence Eleanor, even to the point of having agents break into her apartment  one night and drug her as she is sleeping. She is hospitalized and fired after appearing strung out in the Delacroy cafeteria. He closest associate,Danny (David Alpay) is more easily placated by his bosses.
 Once released from the hospital, Eleanor bluffs her way into attending Jack's birthday party. She speaks with Tom, and even dances with him but, feeling that it is in bad form to mention her findings about the election when everyone is enjoying themselves. Dobbs gives her his personal phone number.
  Eleanor still holds her tongue when she joins Dobbs and his entourage on a paintball fight. But at month's end, when she joins them for Thanksgiving dinner, she gets Tom alone, tells him the truth, and leaves.
 Menken tells Tom to ignore her and press on towards Inauguration Day.
  Stewart and James discredit Eleanor at a press conference, and their attacks on Eleanor mount as they try to take her computer to destroy evidence of the glitch that declared a comedian president as she appeals to Tom for help.
 As Dobbs explores the Oval Office as a guest of President Kellogg, he makes a decisive course of action that will ultimately restore integrity to the election, exonerate  the imperiled Eleanor, and make him the titular Man of the Year.
  Lewis Black as Eddie Langston, Karen Hines as Alison McAndrews, Linda Kash as Jenny Adams, Faith Daniels as the debate moderator, and James Carville, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Chris Matthews as themselves  round out the cast in this tale where the true victor is Integrity.",1446508800,,3350,5.071297989031079

2703502,4,B000LC5B7O,"If you want to revisit Robin Williams playing the type of witty line talker, nice guy who cares about others character that he is most famous for in a straight to DVD movie you never bothered to see before, Man of the Year is a pretty good choice.  In fact this one even lets you remember a bit of his stand-up comedian career and guest appearances on talk shows as his character Tom Dobbs does both those things throughout the movie too.

Man of the Year has two separate plots which of course cross paths about two thirds of the way into the film.  The first has Tom Dobbs a comedian and talk show host encouraged by an audience member to run for president.  His fans in the millions tell him to give it a go so he does. He doesn't expect to win but wants to shake things up and maybe force some changes. He's a man of the people, not letting big corporations fund his campaign so he won't owe them a thing if elected.  An invite to the two main characters great TV debate pretty much tells the media he's actually in with a chance when he doesn't play by the rules and highlights the public is sick of the spiels by the traditional candidates.

Meanwhile a computer company has developed an electronic voting machine that's supposed to make voting easier and therefore more appealing to the public.  However an employee finds a glitch in the code that means the thing doesn't give accurate results.  She raises it with her superiors who of course don't want this news public and will take whatever measures they need to do, to make sure this information is not passed onto the media.

It's this second plot that is by far the weaker of the two. Contains some spoilers from here - I'm guessing writers came up with the first one and thought, okay so he runs for president, then what do we do? He wins okay then how do we end the film? Yeah I don't want to make a movie of him actually running the country there's not much we could do with that, he either does a really good job, or a really bad job.  Maybe we could assassinate him?  Yeah I guess we could do that, can you come up with a funny and amusing way to kill him?  No, well this a comedy movie so, oh what's that the printer's playing up again, you can't find any paper jam, it's probably the computer then, oh hey there's an idea, what if the computer that the voters use stuffs up?  Yeah that will do.

Then trying to merge both plots is where the really weak script writing comes into play.  Again spoilers - there's no way Elanor would have been able to get anywhere near the president elect. Especially with a fake FBI badge, the secret service wouldn't let any random stranger just approach a table he's eating dinner at. If somehow they needed to meet up perhaps it should have been at the hospital where he was visiting Jack. Maybe she's in a hallway and his security knocks her over clearing a path and he intervenes, asks if she's all right would like to sit down and keep him company until Jack wakes up or something, then she can start to have the moral debate while he thinks I wouldn't mind getting her number to hook up later. She's not the brightest person in the world either, she's just threatened to bankrupt a major company so goes home by herself, thinks there may be someone in her apartment but doesn't at the very least go get a couple of neighbours to come in with her to make sure no one's inside.  Then she's pretty sure someone was in her shower but thinks I'll just go sit on a couch and watch TV.  Later she does the same thing at the motel, the door's open, instead of leaving she thinks I better go up and see if someone is inside.  She also decides that phone boxes with no one around are a safe place to make a call that someone is trying to kill her.  It's not that Laura Linney does a bad job, it's just a very weak script when it comes to her character.

If you want to watch Robin Williams again in a comedic role, and you haven't seen this, it's a good movie to do so.  I'd rate this three and a half stars.",1412985600,,4007,4.239159001314061

2703504,5,B000LC5B7O,"Such an interesting story. Robin Williams plays a comedian with his own TV show who is brave enough and smart enough to take on political humor. His fans are tired of the way politics is going and encourage him to run for president. Robin's character Tom Dobbs take the advice of his fans and does run for president. Tom wins. However, there is a glitch. The manufacturer of the computer programs that manages the results does not accurately tally the votes. The rest of the movie shows what lengths a corporation will go to in order to cover up any flaws in their products. Man of the Year also shows how whistle blowers suffer for telling the truth. Eventually Tom Dobbs finds out the truth about the election and then he has to make a choice. The movie is an interesting look at a situation that could happen in real life. Man of the Year addresses what can happen to employees and candidates should the vote counting programs malfunction. I recommend this for anyone.",1412467200,2,971,4.586206896551724

2703508,2,B000LC5B7O,"Talk about deceptive advertising. While the trailers for this movie sold it as a political comedy, the tone of it is actually more serious and includes elements of romance and thrillers. Sadly, the results are less than compelling and rather stale. In MAN OF THE YEAR Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs, a political comedian like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert, who decides to run for president on the suggestion of one of his audience members (which gets an applause and millions of emails). Venturing onto the campaign trail, he shakes things up by not following the norm when it comes to political conduct and being honest about the issues without beating around the bush. Subsequently, he wins in a landslide. Or did he? While there are elements of Robin's standup peppered through the film, the central conflict is actually about computerized voting machines. How riveting. You would think that Robin Williams re-teaming with Barry Levinson, who directed him in GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and has done some excellent political satire in the past (e.g., WAG THE DOG), would be a slam-dunk but it's far from that. At best, it's poorly written with lots of tired jokes and half-hearted attempts at humor. At worst, it's a dull story that tries to liven things up but just makes a mess out of the plot. Still, all the actors involved do give good performances. Robin Williams, even though on autopilot, does decent work. Christopher Walken and Laura Linney also do a decent job. Pity that they were given something sub par to work with. Ultimately, this film fails to say anything that a majority of Americans aren't already thinking, and the possibilities of a political comedian actually winning an election aren't fully explored. While well-filmed and acted, the story was too inconsistent and the themes underdeveloped. My advice is to skip it and watch one of Robin Williams' standup specials.",1410998400,,1889,4.981012658227848

This part is strictly a comedy with a few good laughs thrown in. However, a political thriller is in the works as a company who makes voting machines has a glitch & one person finds out as they try to eliminate her. They go to her apartment, drug her, & suddenly it's almost like 2 movies in one. The woman goes to Dobbs, who is voted president by now, to tell him with her former company hot on her trail. One minute is a comedy, the next a thriller. Is it enjoyable? Yes but too predictable. Williams does a great job but the rest of the all star cast lacks. Recommended if you cant figure out one night between a comedy or a thriller.",1410134400,,757,4.227586206896552

I wish Robin Williams was not only alive but that he had run for president based upon this movie.  He would have made a far better president that what we have today.  I was disappointed in the movie saying a comedian can't be president because frankly this is a representative form of government and anyone can be president, even a B movie actor like Ronald Reagan - I would rather have an A-list actor like Robin Williams as president and am sorry he is no longer with us.  I suspect he was disillusioned with people and a world going in the wrong direction.",1409961600,2,729,4.526717557251908
2703547,5,B000LC5B7O,"I can't believe the harsh criticism this film has received.  For Robin Williams fans, I found it funnier than Good Morning Vietnam and more engaging than Good Will Hunting.

I love how this film showcases the comedic and dramatic talents of Robin Williams.  He is one of the few actors that is amazing at both, I can't think of anyone else who would pull off the role so well.  Watching Robin Williams blow away his debate opponents and deal with newfound responsibility is a treat. This film is chock-full of his trademark humor, but there is also a tense and compelling plot to keep you engaged.

As a programmer who works on experiments which are difficult to test, the election glitch really impressed me with its realism.  Most movies portray programmers as infallible beings who never make major mistakes unless they are idiotic or corrupt, this film dares to take a more realistic view.  Most people have looked at this as a downside of the film, but I found it (and the moral wrangling that fell out of it) to be one of the film's highlights.  I guess everyone has been misled by the pop-culture view of programmers, the ""zoom-and-enhance"" CSI wizards, instead of the less impressive reality.

I have a couple of minor issues with the film:  It could have slowed down in the beginning to explain why a comedian thinks it's worth his time to run for president (the movie spent about 2 seconds on it), and they could have done a better job explaining why no one thought the discrepancy between exit polls and results was suspicious (I would have inserted a scene where Dobbs tells his supporters to lie during their exit polls as a big joke on the pollsters).

A great film with brilliant performances, a fascinating storyline, a knack for realism and a very satisfying ending.  Massively underrrated.",1409961600,,1807,4.719745222929936
2703548,4,B000LC5B7O,"This is a re-teaming of Robin Williams and director Barry Levinson who made the wonderful ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" together. This film is not quite as good as that one but that would be a very tall order to fill. The plot is that Williams, a stand up comic and tv host named Tom Dobbs, runs for President of the USA. However, the company that tabulates the polls to determine the winner does not pay attention to one of its tech people, Laura Linney, who says there is a big flaw in the tabulating system.

This computer glitch ultimately throws Williams and Linney together. They are attracted to one another plus he is willing to listen to her. Basically this all works and the two of them are good together. Plus Williams' comedic bits, showcased throughout, are pure gold. I especially enjoyed his appearing on SNL with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to discuss his presidential situation comedically. Christopher Walken as his manager-agent is also quite good.

Where the film is much weaker is with the covert plotting and attacks that the big bad computer corporation gets going. Jeff Goldblum is the heavy thug tasked to neutralize Linney and he and his other thugs are ridiculous. That whole segment of this screenplay needed to be written out and something that fit the rest of the movie written in to replace it. It's as if two different movies were going on with this very ""B movie"" corporate skullduggery element. It is hard to believe a pro like Levinson put this subplot into his movie. He even has them ramming cars into pay phone booths as part of their corporate plot against Linney.

I enjoyed it nonetheless because the rest of the movie was quite good and enjoyable. I loved Robin Williams work, virtually all of it, so can enjoy him in a film and just ignore a director's big mistake on another segment. If you can't ignore it, you may rank this lower than I do.

So Robin Williams who represents extremely controversial issues like ""health care"" and ""the environment"" gets elected by mistake. Williams' speeches are more empty and vacuous than the average politician's. The scene where he takes over the whole debate and the other candidates are left speechless is unbelievably ludicrous.

""Man of the Year"" is about a political talk-show comedian Tom Dobbs. (Robin Williams) When a lady at one of his shows suggests he should run for president, he takes it to heart.

I beileve this movie had the potential to be better then it accually was, but the plot of the Delecroy voting malfunction really was not that interesting.

What I liked about this movie is that it's relevant to current politics. It points out, in a very funny way, the fact that no matter who is in office, it always seems like business as usual. Nothing ever changes no matter who gets elected.

This movie is so incredibly funny. Williams, with his unique way of making any topic funny, really tells it like it is with the political landscape. You get to laugh a lot during this movie. There are so many ""you're so right, I know what you mean"" moments.

I would recommend this movie to anyone regardless of their political views(it might even open a few eyeballs with its content)I hope others take the time to watch and enjoy the laughter.",1229472000,,535,4.469387755102041
2703805,4,B000LC5B7O,"Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a political comedian. Think Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert. Christopher Walken plays his manager. One night on his show, someone asks him why he doesn't run for President, and the ball starts rolling. At first, it's just a lark, a publicity stunt, but it becomes more real when he debates the regular candidates. And even more real when he wins.

Or is it? Laura Linney plays a woman who works for the company who devised the computer voting system, and she's discovered a glitch. She tells the head of the company (Jeff Goldblum), and receives the equivalent of a ""don't worry your pretty little head about it."" She thinks the problem's been fixed, but when she sees the election results, she knows it hasn't been.

And then the story becomes serious, as the company tries to shut her up using whatever means is necessary, and all those in power are more concerned with perceptions than reality. As long as Tom Dobbs looks like the legally elected President, that's more important than whether or not he actually is.

I truly do not think that the movie changed directions--it's more that the viewers' expectations did. Which is, I think, the fault of the marketing department.

Given the way the story is set up in the first half, there's no other way it could have played out in the second. The computer company's willingness to overlook the problem and the huge amount of money riding on the program was introduced early on. There's no way you can make that funny, and no way you can resolve it in an amusing way without being unbelievable.

And much as the ending pained me, there was no way it could have ended differently, either. The ending message is that maybe the crisis would prompt politicians to act differently in the future, but, call me a cynic, I wouldn't count on it.

I think (hope) it made people uncomfortable to think that people in positions of power really can be that ruthless. Hopefully, after they've vented about movies that ""aren't really comedies,"" a little spark will linger in the backs of their heads.

My biggest pet peeve: the ""problem"" with the software. I'm not even going to spoiler it, because it's really, really stupid, and it's not much of a revelation, anyway: the program had a glitch that made it automatically select a name with double letters in it as the winner. It would have been much better to leave the actual glitch vague than to come up with something that idiotic.

If you're a programmer, and that seems logical to you, please let me know. I'll feel so much better about it.",1227312000,,2561,4.662971175166297

2703807,3,B000LC5B7O,"`Man of the Year' is essentially two different films, one is a comedy about a comedian who is surprisingly elected as our next U.S. President; the other is a drama about a woman who stumbles across a glitch in a balloting service that ultimately elects the wrong president.  The two work well in moments, and yet restrict each other in moments.  The end result is an entertaining film that doesn't quite reach its full potential.

The film tells the story of comedian Tom Dobbs (a comedian in the line of Jon Stewart) who on a whim places himself in the running for the presidency and, surprisingly, wins.  After his win he has to adjust to his new role as head of the country while Eleanor Green, a former employee of the company manufacturing the new balloting devices, chases him around trying to inform him that he is not really the president.

As a comedy the film does not work as well as it does as a drama.  The plot line involving Eleanor as she hides out from her former bosses who want to silence her for fear of profit losses on account of their error is far more riveting than the plot involving Dobbs and his presidency.  The problem is that Williams is not really funny here, while Linney is superbly dramatic in her role.  Williams appears to be restrained by the material, never given a chance to really break away from his controlled persona and unleash the comedic genius we love to embrace.  Linney on the other hand is given a much more complex character to embody and so her performance elevates her section of the film.  When she shares the screen with Williams he seems to feed off of her energy and thus his performance shines brighter.

Christopher Walken and Lewis Black steal most of Williams' thunder, which is sad because this film would seem like the perfect vehicle for the comedic talents of Williams.  He just appears dull most of the time.  Jeff Goldblum is devilishly evil and actually made me proud (I am not a fan of his generally).  But this movie belongs to Linney, for she is really the greatest thing about it.

In the end I must say that I was a little put off with this film, as a comedy, but as a dramatic thriller I was actually quite impressed.  The two don't mesh together as well as they should have (mostly because the comedic portions of the film aren't really all that funny) but in the end we are left with a film that is entertaining and is satisfying and is definitely unexpected (who would have ever guessed it would work as a thriller as apposed to a comedy?).

2703808,4,B000LC5B7O,"Man of the Year
With Happy Madison pulling a ton of random movies that generally have the same characters in them, it's nice to have a comedy movie that isn't a bunch of slapstick humor. Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs, a comedian who loves to make jokes about politics. Oddly enough, Tom Dobbs soon finds himself is the role of candidate for presidency largely due to his fans enjoying his comments about politics.

Tom Dobbs ends up winning the Presidential Election by using his radical personality to win people over. Soon he learns that a new voting system that was implemented had an error. He did not actually win the Presidential Election. Eleanor Green, a creator of the new system, soon finds herself in tremendous trouble while trying to explain the error to Dobbs. She is often attacked and nearly killed.

The movie is a weird mix of comedy and a bit of thriller. Any point with Robin Williams leads to some good comedy and a ton of political jokes. Eleanor Green gives you a bit of suspense while watching her being chased. I think the two parts mix together and give you a very entertaining movie.

2703840,3,B000LC5B7O,"Robin Williams plays a populist television host who runs for president in the 2006 Barry Levinson film MAN OF THE YEAR.  The actor's superb, often funny performance commands attention, carrying the film despite its plot devices too weak for the viewer to suspend disbelief.

Today's corporation-dominated media would make it difficult for a pro-working class host such as the MAN OF THE YEAR character Williams portrays to even get a shot on television.  Moneyed interests sycophants dominate T.V. discourse, as the objectives of media owners such as General Electric (NBC) and Viacom (CBS) oppose what's best for the people.

MAN OF THE YEAR addresses computerized voting, depicting the election that awards the White House to the talk show host as a programming malfunction.  It does not deal with computerized voting's greater problems: Vote-rigging and the interest conflicts of companies with ties to the Republican Party obtaining voting system contracts.

In 2004, historically flawless exit polls predicted John Kerry winning the presidential election.  Yet the official vote count went to George W. Bush.  MAN OF THE YEAR does not attend to the questions the corporate media would have raised with a populist candidate defying exit polls.  Of course, as the moneyed interest man Bush was the '04 ""winner,"" the corporate media let it slide.  (See the Mark Crispin Miller book FOOLED AGAIN for more information about the corrupt 2004 presidential vote count.)

MAN OF THE YEAR depicts the T.V. host debating the Democratic and Republican candidates on television.  It is hard to believe that the presidential debates, which the Republican and Democratic parties have controlled since 1996, would allow another person to participate.

Regarding the subjects of marital infidelity and drug abuse, MAN OF THE YEAR includes jokes referring to Bill Clinton's fling but offers no wisecracks about George W. Bush's drinking and drugging problems.

Corporate media buffoons such as Chris Matthews play themselves in MAN OF THE YEAR.  Well, they sure know how to read a script.

Even more noteworthy than Robin Williams is Jeff Goldblum as the computerized voting firm's executive goon.  Despite Mr. Goldblum's familiar soft-spoken presence, he projects a frightening level of menace that makes MAN OF THE YEAR worth viewing even if there were nothing else good about the film.",1209340800,,2375,5.307486631016043
2703841,5,B000LC5B7O,"""Man of The Year"" is typical Robin Williams. Not that that is a bad thing, mind you. I have been a fan of Williams since the ""Mork and Mindy"" days. He has proven himself a capable actor, from his comfortable comedic roles, to drama and the occasional suspense/thriller.

In ""Man of The Year"", he puts politics under the microscope for all to see, with tongue firmly in cheek. The film addresses the myriad faults of our political system. It also interjects the idea of honesty, and what a problem honesty can cause. I find this particularly funny, because ""We The People"" expect this from our elected officials, yet allow flagrant dishonesty to thrive, election after election. In this instance, we see just how incapable our elected officials are at coping with the very ideal that sent them to Washington in the first place!

Laura Linney is also very good in this film. She plays an analyst for a software company that becomes embroiled in the election campaign for William's character. I believe Laura Linney is one of those actors that have been passed over, time after time, remaining just under the radar. I have seen her in a ton of films, and she deserves some recognition for her performances.

Christopher Walken. What more needs to be said? He has played good guys, bad guys, and everything in between, from drama, to comedy. The role he plays in ""Man of The Year"" puts him squarely in a wheelchair. A strange  place for one of the most energetic actors in Hollywood!

Anyone seeing this film should not let party affiliation affect how this film is ""judged"". after all, it IS a funny film, and politics is funnier still, so sit back and enjoy!",1208217600,,1753,4.660194174757281
2703842,3,B000LC5B7O,"Robin Williams has a proven track record in comedy and in serious roles (such as Awakenings). I think the writers on this venture were trying to take Pat Paulsen's role on The Smothers Brothers to the next level. I know many younger folks aren't familiar with the sixties show, so let me bring you up to snuff.
-------------------------------------------------------------
From Wikipedia: In 1967, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour premiered. Paulsen said he was hired because he sold them cheap songs and would run errands. At first he was cast as their editorialist, and his deadpan, double-talk comments on the issues of the day propelled him into the national consciousness. (His deadpan work was nearly flawless: on one isolated occasion, in a talk about Hawaii, he defined a wahine as something you put on a bu-hun with lots of mu-hustard. His composure started to crack, but he recovered.) His work on The Smothers Brothers' Comedy Hour earned Paulsen an Emmy in 1968.[1] Early in 1969, Paulsen headlined his own series, Pat Paulsen's Half A Comedy Hour, which ran 13 weeks on ABC. Guests on the first show were former Vice President of the United States Hubert Humphrey and an animated Daffy Duck, the latter of whom was interiewed by Paulsen.

The comedian was approached by the Smothers Brothers with the idea of running for President in 1968. His reply, he was later to recount, was: ""Why not? I can't dance -- besides, the job has a good pension plan and I'll get a lot of money when I retire.""

Paulsen's campaign that year, and in succeeding years, was grounded in comedy, while not bereft of serious commentary. He ran the supposed campaigns using obvious lies, double talk, and tongue-in-cheek attacks on the major candidates, and responded to all criticism with his catch phrase ""Picky, picky, picky"". His campaign slogan was ""Just a common, ordinary, simple savior of America's destiny.""

Paulsen's name appeared on the ballot in New Hampshire for the Democratic Primary several times. In 1996 he received 921 votes (1%) to finish second to President Bill Clinton (76,754 votes). In 1992 he came in second to George Bush in the North Dakota Republican Primary.

Pat Paulsen was never serious and I think ""Man Of The Year"" was trying to show what might have been, had he been serious.

I don't think the blame should be on the movie-makers but rather the promoters and advertisers.

The movie is a both comedy and drama.  But the choice of Robin Williams to be the one to pull this off was perfect and unmistakable.  I don't believe that this movie was meant to be a 'Wag the Dog' kind of movie.  'Man of the Year' is a very fictional movie, with some political jabs, but in the end, a fictional tale that isn't too close-to-home.  It makes you think, but doesn't really go deeper than that.

It goes well beyond being a comedy and adds thrills similar to ""The Pelican Brief"" when a cover-up threatens the life of a lady the new president meets.

And if this is film is scripted, you would never know.  Williams makles this text his own. Williams's comedy in this movie is part satire and part stand up comedy

Surrounded by a supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Lewis Black and Laura Linney) that truly supports its lead actor. This makes this comedy work better than most poltical satires (like Wag the Dog or Primary Colors). The problem is the sub plots with Linney of a rigged election and Walken's illness that seems not to work for me

There are moments of sound gaps in Williams's Stand up, but it ma,es it most like a political banter

The problem is the ending seems too pat for my tastes. It gives a great punch and then end falls flat and does not work for me.

If you LOVE Robin Williams, you will overlook the faults and enbrace this film with open arms

2703902,3,B000LC5B7O,"Man of the Year was a bit of a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast, Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Laura Linney, and Jeff Goldblum among others, though by no means is it a terrible movie.
A comedian, often critical of Capitol Hill and politics, decides to run for President and gets voted in office in a surprise electoral victory carrying all 13 states in which his name is on the ballot.
The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.
In short, the acting is good, the plot is average, while the humor could have been a lot better.
One thing was rather curious and that was how a specific small religious/ethnic group was mentioned throughout the movie for no apparent reason whatsoever except to promote it and possibly get the audience exposed to it and/or used to it... Hmmm...

It may have been a little better if I hadn't seen the preview. As much as I wanted it to be a good video it seemed to get worse and worse as it went on. It turns into a crazy conspiracy theory movie. Not really what it should be and it seemed to drag on. I really wanted to like this one especially because I'm a big Robin Williams fan, but I couldn't.

2703908,2,B000LC5B7O,"As other reviewers have noted, this movie has a hard time deciding whether it is a comedy or a drama.  It is billed and advertised as a comedy but it is not 100% a comedy.  Robin Williams plays a commedian/talk show host, Tom Dobbs, who decides to run for President on the urging of his fans.  The first part of the movie thus plays out as a comedy in which Dobbs makes fun of his political opponents.  Eventually, Dobbs is elected President.  At this point, the movie turns into a drama.  I would not mind, except that many aspects of the drama portion are an insult to the viewer's intelligence.

New electronic voting machines were used for the election, and it turns out there is a software glitch; the machines declare the winner based on the alphabetical order of repeated consanants in the candidate's name, so that the ""BB"" in Dobbs makes him a winner over other candidates with ""GG"", and ""LL"" in their names.  This is a really stupid software glitch; I would have preferred something more plausible.  Elenor, a woman in the company designing the electronic voting machines discovers the glitch and the company tries to discredit and silence her.  Eleanor manages to reach Tom Dobbs and eventually tells him, and he goes public with the news because he knows, in his heart, that he should not have been elected.  The length of time it takes Eleanor to tell Dobbs about the glitch is also annoying and insulting to viewers.

I think the film would have been better if we got to see Dobbs do all the things he said he would and assemble a non-partisan cabinet, and work toward representing the people who elected him rather than special interst groups.  Eleanor could have seen that Tom Dobbs as President would be good for America, fallen in love with him, and chosen to keep quiet about the glitch.  This would have made for an interesting romantic comedy.",1184803200,3,1864,4.62613981762918

2703940,3,B000LC5B7O,"Political comedian, Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), runs for President as an Independent, and you guessed it...he wins. A company called Delacroy, has created a new computer-based voting system that is used in the new election. During the election a Delacroy employee, Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), discovers the voting system is flawed and that Tom Dobbs was elected because of a computer glitch. Before word gets out, Delacroy fires Green and ruins her credibility. She must decide what to do with the information she has on the faulty voting system, even though she believes Tom Dobbs is the best choice for the country.

This biggest problem with this movie is its identity crisis. Is this a comedy or a political drama/thriller? Robin Williams does what this role demands. His character is over the top, funny, and even likeable. Laura Linney is likewise great in her role as a disgruntled ex-employee with a secret that will rock the country. However, the two storylines of these characters feel like two different movies altogether, and when they merge it really doesn't work. The rest of the cast is average at best, with extremely mediocre appearances by Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken. Should these two actors ever be cast in the same movie? Too much eccentricity for me.

I am so disappointed because this movie could have been great. Two great concepts: political comedian becomes President and new voting system gone bad. Too bad they belong in separate movies.",1182384000,3,1476,5.045081967213115

But, since we were in the doldrums between the end of the new spring TV shows and the start of the summer season of new offerings, I figured it was worth $3.95 to pass a couple of hours.  I wasn't disappointed, but I definetly won't be adding to my permanent DVD collection either.

The storyline had so much potential to be a political satire loosely based on a Jon Stewart-type personality becoming President, that I actually caught myself enjoying it.  But just when I thought they'd bring down the house, the pulled the rug out from under me by ruining it with computer-election fraud.

Strangely williams recent dramatic appearances have been nearly twice as good as his comedic ones... Though williams is not responsible if a movie he acts in is not perfect - his talents can and should be used more effectively..

Now for the good stuff about this movie - it is completely relevant - one thing modern politics has shown us over the past years is that it deserves to be mocked.. our well greased political structure works well at dealing with business and watching out for the wealthy but it is a system which (very often)neglects the individual and, indeed, the power of a vote (we know this from the gore-bush race - yes gore did actually get elected)..

2703946,3,B000LC5B7O,"Robin Williams is a bit mis-cast as a Jon Stewart/Bill Maher/Dennis Miller-clone, but does have a few shining moments in this mostly benign comedy from the pen & camera of Barry Levinson.

Williams plays Tom Dobbs, an irreverent host of a political satire talk show who, for some unknown reason, decides to run for President.  He certainly asks the tough questions of his opponents during the liveliest scene of the movie-- the Presidential Debate-- but never really answers his own rhetoric.  Williams' Dobbs scores the zinger, but never provides the direction to the answer.

I think the big problem with this movie, is that it is not sure what it wants to be-- political comedy/satire, romantic comedy, thriller or even morality tale.  The combo of Levinson & Williams back together again for the first time since 1987s hit Good Morning, Vietnam were not able to re-capture that magic.

It is very much a ""been there, heard that already"" kind of political satire, and the thriller story-line just does not hold much congressional weight.

The great cast includes: Christopher Walken, Lewis Black, Jeff Goldblum & a superbly manic/neurotic Laura Linney if all a bit wasted here.",1180483200,2,1180,5.02051282051282

In a momentary lapse of judgement I rented this from a redbox. I knew  with Robin Williams as the lead that I was taking a risk but I thought that the prescence of Chris Walken could maybe redeem the movie. Besides I figured even if it wasn't that great it would only be a dollar investment. Today I sit in quiet reflection over what i must boldly state is the worst movie ever.

I watched this with some friends and never once during the movie did I hear the sounds of laughter. Just uncomfortable, embarassed, awkward silence as Tom Dobbs (Williams) threw out zinger after zinger, perhaps hoping that the sheer volume of terrible jokes could compensate for the incoherent story line. But it was all in vain. Much to my dismay the movie actually continued after the election and turned into a ""thriller"" about a big business trying to kill an employee with a shocking secret.

2703975,4,B000LC5B7O,"I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film although I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by it.

The movie takes place in a contemporary setting in which a comedy talkshow host played by Robin Williams decides to run for the Presidency after being urged by millions of his fans, as well as by his staff members and production crew. 'Man of the Year' has a very fast pace hence it doesn't really spend much time on the characters, but then again that isn't the point of the film. This isn't a satire as the trailer makes it out to be, instead it is a serious piece that highlights all the problems with the current American political system, and as such it functions as a vehicle for bringing forth those problems in a plausible yet highly entertaining manner, allowing the public to apply some critical thinking about what is wrong with our government, the way elections are run and what the real issues should be about.

Of course that's not to say that there wasn't comedy throughout to juxtapose the absurdity of fund raising and political hypocrisy against the creative mind of a news and politics pundit who is quite vocal about that which is rotten at the heart of our democracy. Some might find this film a little confusing because it's not the comedy they were expecting, but for those who are interested in real issues and practical ways of solving them will find more than they bargained for in this intelligent drama, or should I say dramedy since it's primarily a political drama fused with comedy.

Robin Williams is at his usual best presenting a comedian named Tom Dobbs who truly cares about the future of America and refuses to partake in partisanship, mud slinging and dirty fund raising. Despite his jovial nature, he's more serious and committed to the public than his Republican and Democrat counterparts, which strikes a chord with the average American. Christopher Walken stars as Jack Menken, Dobbs' manager and partner in crime, who does a terrific job as always, although perhaps a bit under-utilized. The actress who stood out from the cast however was Laura Linney who played a software engineer by the name of Eleanor Green who is in charge of creating electronic voting software for the large software developer Delacroy. Without giving too much away, she kind of ends up becoming Dobbs' muse who inspires him to do the right thing and stand by his principles. Lewis Black stars alongside Williams as Eddie Langston, who works with Dobbs on his TV talkshow as well as the campaign trail, and he has his moments, but he doesn't really get enough screen time to showcase his comedic brilliance.

This isn't a classic, but it's a worthwhile diversion for those not only seeking some escapism but also some food for thought about the direction of the USA and what we need to do to get this country back on track, to make it a America people can be proud of, one that is for the people and by the people as opposed to the corporate world.

However, when I finally saw this movie, my first impression was that it could not be further from the truth.

The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy movie?

Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think.",1176076800,,942,4.491228070175438
2703979,3,B000LC5B7O,"With a cast that includes Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Laura Linney, Lewis Black, and Jeff Goldblum you expect a lot.  When the film is directed by Barry Levinson, you expect even more.  Due to the marketing of this film, particularly the choices of trailers, you'll expect a comedy.  Whatever it is that you expect, I can almost guarantee you'll get less.

The central issue with this film is the script, plain and simple.  You can't fault the actors and director.  They do their best to get this dog to hunt.  The film starts out strong, with the premise of a political talk show host (Tom Dobbs) running for president.  Here the script has clear momentum, and the film has its best moments.  Had the writers stuck with this premise, and followed it through to a conclusion, this film would have been a slam dunk 5 star film.  The film could have been an important and entertaining look about the marketing of a candidate, and how voters tend to act on perception and prescribed ideology, rather than substance.

But that's not what they chose.  Instead, we are diverted to a weak and paranoid subplot involving a voting machine glitch that results in the wrong candidate (Dobbs) being elected.  But that's not all.  An ethical employee (Eleanor Green) discovers the glitch and tries to report it to the CEO.  She is silenced by the CEO and the General Counsel of the corporation.  Worse, the evil corporation (Delacroy) does her physical harm and publically disgraces her.  This is the typical Hollywood portrait of the evil, money-grubbing corporation.  You know the ones; they put profits before people, and will stop at nothing, even murder(!) to protect their stock price.  I find these Hollywood stereotypes tiresome and disingenuous, particularly since big, rich corporations are releasing the films.

Nonetheless, the bad script choices should not deter you from seeing this film.  Robin Williams once again shows his genius as Tom Dobbs.  His trademark rant monologues were vintage Williams, but I preferred his quieter moments.  His realization that he had actually been elected was subtle but meaty.  His first visit to the Oval Office and his realization of the weight now on his shoulders was brilliant.  His disclosure scene on ""Saturday Night Live"" with ""Weekend Update"" babes Tina Fey and Amy Poehler was poignant and real.  Laura Linney gave a tremendous performance as Eleanor Green.  Her character had to show an amazingly big arc, and she pulled it off.  Her breakdown in the company cafeteria was uncomfortable and pitiable, and her subsequent scenes where she was on the run from the big, bad Delacroy Corp. were credible.  Christopher Walken turns in yet another solid performance as Dobbs' manager Jack Menken.  As always, he gives a free clinic on acting with the voice.  Jeff Goldblum as Delacroy attorney Alan Stewart is a great bad guy, menacing yet civil.

2704018,3,B000LC5B7O,"I really liked the story line of this movie. Well, up to a point anyway. Tom Dobbs is a national television-icon -- imagine if Oprah moved to a prime-time slot and started telling hilarious jokes. A suggestion from an audience member to announce his candidacy for president seemed like a great publicity stunt and next thing Dobbs knew, he was the President Elect.

So far so good.

And then a lonely, out-of-work character played so adorably by Laura Linney comes into his life and we have feelings reminiscent of Michael Douglas and Annette Bening in The American President. Sure the feelings were as much clich as they were warm and fuzzy, but it was nice.

And then it happened.

Gone were the shadows of Douglas and Bening as the movie began to borrow pages from, of all things, a Ryan Phillippe movie - that I do not recommend to anyone (Antitrust). For awhile I sincerely thought that the story was ruined and there was no hope left, but they surprised me with how well the movie ended.

For as crass and aggressive as Robin Williams has been as a stand-up comedian, he has played some incredibly profound and likeable characters. This role, like many others, really showed how talented he is. I thought he was great, even though the movie was a little less about him and more about the situation in which he finds himself. I would have loved more story about who Tom Dobbs actually was rather than the ridiculous plot turns that the movie featured instead. Let's put it this way, would you rather watch more Robin Williams or some silly side story involving Jeff Goldblum?

Jokes about Jeff Goldblum aside, the movie really had a great cast. Man of the Year starred Robin Williams, Laura Linney, Christopher Walken and Lewis Black. Christopher Walken was Tom Dobbs's manager and he, as always, was wildly entertaining. And Lewis Black was surprisingly subdued, which is a little uncharacteristic for him, but he did very well.

If I could miraculously remove the part of the movie which reminded me of Punch Drunk Love in a way - where the attempt to show true true human tenderness is almost eclipsed by the disturbed nature of the plot and characters - I would recommend this movie to everyone.

He's Tom Dobbs a politcal savvy comedian (what a stretch) who is heckled into running for president during one of his comedy gigs. A public relation stunt turns serious & builds up steam. He is as smart, as well qualified & far more charismatic that the Republican or Democrat canidates. That is director Barry Levinson's point.

They are making lots of money with a total, no paper trail vote. A small little cog in this big operation, Eleanor (Laura Linney) finds a glitch.
This glitch determines before the election that Dobbs will win. Even she is dubious. Dobbs is after all a long shot, has spent no money & is an independent. To everyone's surprise, he wins. She brings this up to the executives at Delacroy & fearing lose of their empire shut her down. They discredit her, destroy her credibility & fire her. She decides to get to Dobbs, now the incumbent & tell him. Amazingly & very quickly she is accepted into the president-elect's inner circle. The movie slows down a bit while Dobbs & Eleanor fall in love. She tries to tell him but can't. Her judgement is clouded by love & the belief that he would be the best man.  Eventually she does tell him that he has indeed lost. Now it is his turn to show integrity since no one would believe her. Chris Walken plays Dobbs agent & best friend & Lewis Black is under used as a speech/gag writer. Jeff Goldblume is of course the evil corporate executive. Dobbs does the right thing in the end which unfornunately did not happen in reality when in 2000, the loser actually did become president.

2704062,3,B000LC5B7O,"As many other reviewers have aptly remarked, Man of the Year is the victim of a poor marketing campaign. Cutting together clips from the first 15 minutes of the film when Lou Dobbs (Robin Williams) is on the campaign trail. What some reviewers fail to point out is that the film is also a victim of a stale script and some shaky plotlines.

Throughout the film it really feels as if Robin Williams is holding back in his presentation of a Jon Stewart-esque talk show host who becomes a presidential candidate at the urging of his fans. Many of his pokes at government are forced and vague, and some are just untimely (Enron jokes aren't funny anymore). Perhaps it's an unfunny script, or perhaps seeing Williams' standup persona in a formulated film doesn't work simply because his standup feels so spontaneous.

The actual plot of the movie involves Laura Linney as a computer programmer who discovers a major glitch in the new voting machines (that are being used ALL OVER THE COUNTRY). Linney is consequently fired and then she sets out to right the wrongs of the corporate world, somehow falling for Williams in the process.

What hurts the most about Man of the Year is the amount of potential that such a movie possesses. Imagine: a movie about a fake news funnyman who runs for president and gets elected. A movie about rigged elections covered up by corporate fraud. A movie about political honesty and government for the people by the people. But Man of the Year really doesn't follow through on any of these timely and worthwhile topics. Most of the film falls flat and feels uninspired, though there are some very good moments. Robin Williams is a top-notch actor, and even with a bad script he's not terrible, just unfunny. Christopher Walken and Lewis Black provide some laughs in their supporting roles. But Linney, who's usually reliable, takes her character a little too far over the edge and ends up coming off terribly unstable which leaves the audience wondering why anyone would believe her conspiracy theory in the first place.

Overall, the movie is watchable, if a bit long and slow. There are laughs, but not enough to call it a comedy. There is intrigue, but not enough to call it a thriller, and there are emotions, but not enough to call it a drama. When it comes to genre, Man of the Year is stranded in no man's land, and from the box office receitps, not many wanted to visit it there.

The extras on the DVD are interesting. Mostly you can see Robin Williams going on rants in between takes with material that puts the actual movie to shame. The making of is a bit sad because all the actors are so earnest about making a good meaningful film, and this is definitely not that film.",1174867200,2,2712,4.62993762993763
2704063,5,B000LC5B7O,"First, This movie is NOT a comedy.  Some poor schlub in a studio suit or in Marketing saw the name Robin Williams and said ""We'll push this as a comedy.""  Consequently, it came across in ads and trailers that this was a film of ""What would happen if Stephen Colbert or John Stewart ran for President AND got elected?"" with funny moments in the film taken out of context.  Correctly, this film is a reality check that works far beyond politics.  It poses the question, ""What would happen if Stephen Colbert or John Stewart ran for President, got elected, the whole thing was a fraud due to a computer glitch AND the computer company went so far as to attempt to discredit/destry the life of the person who discovered it and cover the whole thing up?""  What surprises me most is not the failure of the Marketing Dept. (this is not unusual), rather the failure of otherwise intelligent critics to realize this failure.  They seemed confused that the film seriously examined corporate motive and greed that sacrifices the truth and the individual employee along with it (i.e. ENRON, Russel Crowe in ""The Insider"") while critiquing those same operatives in politics (e.g. corporate/political special interest over the needs of the individual/voters).  That a Stephen Colbert gets elected so there are funny bits is immaterial to this bigger picture.  And anyone who doubts the potential realism of the corporate exec's actions in this film not only forget the ""The Insider"" took place before it became a film, they fail to grasp how easy it is in the technological age to credit or discredit an individual with news hounds staving outside for the next juicy rating grabber.  Levinson showed this in ""Wag the Dog"" and Bill and Monica made it a reality. ""Who cares if it's real?  The people are riveted"", newsman Shep Shepherd observes in ""Pump Up the Volume.""  This film both buys into and then challenges that notion. ""Man of the Year"" is a must see, not because Williams is so damned funny (and pointedly observant, too), but because it shows the ease with which the corporate machine can so simply and unapologetically destroy a person or people, even to the end that it compromises the very basis of government itself.  That power and its easy misuse should be keeping people awake at night. How did R.J. Wagner put it to Dr. Evil?  ""And you like an idiot wanted to take over the world.  But you don't realize there is no world anymore; it's all corporations.""",1174780800,4,2458,4.752941176470588

The tag lines, one-liners, rip-offs, innuendo's, and embarrassments keep falling out of this movie one after another. Add the participation of Saturday Night Live, and Lorne Michaels and his crew, and you have a recipe for something special. Dour Christopher Walken and his dry humor add a pinch of salt. (His smoking habit ALMOST makes me want to quit.) Laura Linney is so attractive that - (well, shut my mouth.)  Jeff Goldblum looks like he'd just stepped out of one of the Jurassic Park pieces. I'm surprised that they didn't have Spielberg appear too. Faith Daniels with cleavage... Karen Hines, whom I don't recall seeing before, looks like a budding Natalie Wood. Tom Dobbs' (Williams' character) support staff provides a laugh-a-minute. The voting machine company is called Delacroy, and one has to live in San Francisco to figure out whose corporate name that is a play on! The plot line has an ending that is all too predictable towards the end (the Chron's main criticism.)

Truth be told, computer glitches like the one in the film couldn't happen on such a grand scale: each state controls its own voting methods.  Of course, a voting machine company can make deals with many states.  Even so I think fears of voting machines are exaggerated.

Williams was funny.  Not Mrs. Doubtfire funny, but funny.  Walken is always great.  Williams's commentary on the role of funny folks was well said.  Politicians may suck at times, but we the people choose them.  Comedians are cute and all, but the jester shouldn't sit in the big chair.

  Robin Williams is a great person to play the role of a political humorist turned politician, and is very funny during most of this film, but it is overshadowed by sub plot that was introduced way to early and in a very dumb manor.  How many times could Laura Linney have told him what actually happend.  And the way this was introduce, and the whole unraveling of the cover up, just overshadowed a comedy that could have flourished if they would have introduced the mistake in another way, such as post-election re-count by a software polling person stumbling across it, and then with a change of heart, the company makes it known, or something like that.

A computer glitch amazingly gives Williams the election and he's suddenly the President.  Of course, the young lady who knows about the computer glitch suddenly finds herself romantically involved and in danger of losing her life if she goes public.

Williams is restrained, but not particularly great.  Laura Linney is good as the computer analyst, and Christopher Walken does nice work as Williams' manager.

2704109,3,B000LC5B7O,"This is a movie that fails on as many fronts as it succeeds.  The Screen Play is weak in many spots primarily I think simply to squeeze in the opportunity for the cast to play paint ball, to have a party, and in general waste a lot of time.  Eleanor Green is totally unbelievable both as a computer whiz and as anyone capable of ordering lunch much less making a decision, although she redeems her acting reputation with her lunch room performance which was A+.  Neverteless her character is what drove my three star rating.  I just got fed up with her inability to state her case.  However, the film over all is pretty good and has more than it's share of keen observations regarding our society and our political climate.  Robin Williams is given considerable range and he uses it wisely.  I thought his visit to the Oval Office was particularly well done because you could see in his face how he felt about the awesome power that comes with the Presidency and how unprepared he felt for the job.  His body language spoke volumes and I suspect only some of that was acting.  I also liked his tag line ""I am a Jester and a Jester does not rule the Kingdom, he makes fun of the King"".  This is a very powerful quote and one that I think needs to get a great deal more visibility.  Because people like John Stewart, Bill Maher, and Robin Williams make fun of the politicians, which is their job and they do it well but they are woefully unprepared or capable of doing the jobs they satirize -- but we need their satirizations for perspective.  This movie calls for a coming together as a people and to stop this ridiculous focus on red and blue states and the polarization by party.  The movie calls for a focus on us -- the people -- by our politicians and a reduction in the reliance on lobbyists who act for special interests and not in the interest of the people.  All of this and more is done with the usual Williams quick lip which allows the movie to retain it's lightness and to avoid the usual preachiness we see in most Hollywood Movies today.  I thought the screen play made a real effort to be down the middle and for the most part succeeded.  This is a good movie with a number of good messages and observations about our society today but the best message was ""that not everyone is fit to be king"" and popularity shouldn't be confused with capability.

2704110,5,B000LC5B7O,"It's undeniable that, in the right role, Robin Williams shines. My favorite movie with Williams is Bicentennial Man followed by One Hour Photo. When he's reigned in--he is GOOD.

After being sorely disappointed with Death to Smoochy, I was hesitant to try another Robin Williams comedy. But this movie surprised both me AND my husband for two reasons:

*This is not a comedy, it's a thriller. Why it's marketed as a comedy is beyond me. The funny sequences shown in the trailers are a small part of what this movie is really about. We were GLUED to the screen until the end.

*The writing in this movie is both smart and tight. No phrase or gesture is wasted, and the casting is brilliant. Although Christopher Walken can be one-note, his portrayal of Williams' agents is excellent. (However, my husband noticed a recycled phrase from Bicentennial Man about the ""recreation area"" being located next to the ""waste processing plant"" in the human body.)

If you're wanting a comedy or enjoy juvenile humor, look elsewhere. However, if you enjoy smart thrillers with a dose of good (but not over the top) comedy, you'll likely enjoy Man of the Year. Williams, Walken, Jeff Goldblum, and Laura Linney shine in this film, and the supporting cast is also outstanding.

It hasn't done as well as it should have because it's not as funny as people expect it to be.  What it is, is a try at making a movie that tells about the dangers of corporate greed and the way that people look at elections.

Some of the satire is so subtle in places that you need to watch it two or three times.  Listen very carefully to the answers of the other candidates at the debate, and to their comments at other times during the movie.

Robin Williams character is a cross between John Stewart and Ralph Nader, but Lewis Black almost steals the movie as his writer.  It would be interesting to know how much of the movie was ad libs between the two.

In the end though the movie cops out by letting there be a re-election between the same two bozos, and one of them goes on to do the same old same old, so it's disappointing in that way.",1173052800,9,955,4.157608695652174
2704151,4,B000LC5B7O,"After a spate of roles that Robin Williams elected to play to prove he can be other than a funny guy, roles that were dark and foreboding, along comes the surprise film MAN OF THE YEAR and Williams has the opportunity to shine in both his unbridled comic banter and his more serious and even tender side.  The film was marketed with a Thomas Jefferson cum George Washington wig atop Williams' head and for this viewer that was enough to avoid the film in theaters.  But don't be fooled by that bit of chicanery and foolish choice of PR: this film has so much truth about our political system that it is a springboard for the best in comic writing.

Tom Dobbs is a late night talk show host with a political slant (read Bill Maher type etc) who responds to an audience question 'Why don't you run for President?' by deciding to do so, much to the chagrin of this manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken in a wonderfully underplayed role at last!) and writer Eddie Langston (Lewis Black).  Dobbs is just fed up enough with the government being run by people who have to pay off the lobbyists that get them elected and the big corporate supporters and spend money on everything BUT the people they serve: he seems to be as likely a candidate as any - and the public via email and media support prove him correct.  He debates as an Independent candidate with both the Democrat and Republican and wins the debate hands down.  AND he is elected.

But there is a problem: The new voting system is by a computer company run by Alan Stewart (Jeff Goldblum) and workers Eleanor Green (Laura Linney is a terrific role) and Danny (the hunky and fine David Alpay).  Eleanor discovers a glitch in the computer program that reveals that Dobbs did not indeed win the election and the rest of the film is how she confronts Dobbs with the truth and how Dobbs and crew deal with it.  Suffice it to say that Dobbs' manner of coping makes us wish that he indeed were the President!

The cast is strong and for this viewer the fine balance between comedy and true drama that writer/director Barry Levinson achieves is not only the stuff of fine film making: it is also wise and should be viewed by a very wide audience.  Robin Williams manages to be both his inimitable funny self as well as offer a touching three-dimensional performance of a citizen at odds with the current political system. And Laura Linney adds yet another fine role to her ever-increasing repertoire.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, March 07",1173052800,4,2494,4.552572706935123

Surprisingly, he wins the campaign, but discovers it's due to a computer glitch.  What he does after is the test of his character.

First, why the heck didn't she just tell him immediately...oh yeah, the movie would have ended to soon. Second...what the heck is the overall meaning of this film, was it to say a comedian should run for president, or fear electronic voting...or both.  I don't know.  The pizzaz was not there, and the movie could not commit to being a comedy or a drama, which left me with a bitter taste.  Rent this one folks if you must see it. It is cheaper here on amazon if you feel the overwhelming urge to waste even that amount of money.",1172275200,4,1421,4.447876447876448
2704159,3,B000LC5B7O,"The '06 release of the DVD `Man of the Year' is a tale of two movies not so cleverly disguised as one. It begins like a house on fire leading the viewer to expect this to be the comedy of the year, a tour-de-force by the incomparable Robin Williams as talk show host and comedian Tom Dobbs, soon to become the president-elect of the Unite States. With the presence of Christopher Walken in the role of his personal manager Jack Menken the movie appears on track for a laugh a minute feature.

However all the clever and funny political ranting and raving that distinguishes the first half of the film are sadly and unexpectedly put aside for a not so intriguing conspiracy drama that pushes what Robin Williams does best into the background where he is forced to passively watch the second half of the film wind down into mediocrity. Robin does fire up the comedic monologue again just before the end and thankfully is able to partially save what would have otherwise been a major disaster.

Too bad director Barry Levinson couldn't make up his mind about what kind of film he wanted to make. 'Man of the Year' had the right lead man and cast in place for what could have been a cultural classic to rival Sidney Lumet's 'Network' from '76. What happened Barry?",1172275200,34,1260,4.546255506607929
2704160,3,B000LC5B7O,"While watching ""Man of the Year"" I realized that I want to believe that a comedian could indeed be elected President of the United States.  This stems from my long held conviction that if I could just be included in a presidential debate I would get elected because I would make the other candidates eat their works (the best realization of my peculiar daydream would be what Jed Bartlet did to his opponent in just such a debate on ""The West Wing"").  All John Kerry had to do was say to President Bush ""I voted for it before I voted against it because we all believed what you said about weapons of mass destruction and I did what any American does when they find they were suckered on a deal.""  But if Kerry could not figure out a response to the often-repeated jib that fatally punctured his campaign, then he did not deserve to be president.  Of course comedians have an advantage over politicians in such exchanges, because comedians know how to go cut to the truth of the matter and politicians are trained to go for the lowest common denominator and in the real world punch lines beat sound bites.

You could never tell from the trailer for ""Man of the Year,"" but this 2006 film from writer-director Barry Levinson (""Wag the Dog"") is a lot more serious.  The scene were independent candidate Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) goes off on the Democratic and Republican nominees during the debates seems to be the key to his road to the White House, but the secret of his success lies in the computer voting system developed by the Delacroy Systems (in response to the hanging chads of Florida).  However one of the computer experts at Delacroy, Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), discovers there is something wrong with the program.  She tells the CEO but he ignores her warning because it would destroy his company, and when Dobbs wins the election, Eleanor thinks something should be done.  So does her boss and his right-hand man (Jeff Goldblum), which is where we suddenly find there is a dark side to this supposed comedy.

Consequently, ""Man of the Year"" is put in the position of an awkward balancing act between the funny stuff and the serious side of what is happening.  Dobbs is a political comedian on television in the mold of Jon Stewart, and despite his ability to rife on the foibles of politicians he has a serious understanding of the nation's political problems.  In fact, he gets to be in the final debate because he has been seriously discussing the issues and is in double figures in the polls.  Williams strength here is that he carries off the serious stuff as well as the comic rants, especially in his interactions with Linney.  Dobbs knows better than to pay attention to what people say and a lot of contrivances associated with such plotlines are avoided because he is able to relate to Eleanor as a human being and not a character in a bizarre political plot.  Christopher Walken plays Dobbs' manager, Jack Menken, who sets the stage for the proceedings with his narration explaining the cosmic alignment of events with his personal touch of surrealism, but the performance I really want to highlight is that of Lewis Black as Eddie Langston, who finally tones down an onscreen performance so that he comes across as a sage rather than a crackpot.

What tips this film off balance is when Eleanor uncovers the glitch in the program.  Granted, you want something that most people can easily understand to explain how the program made Dobbs president, but you do not want something that is stupid.  After you find out the glitch (and ignore the rest of this paragraph if you have not) think about what would have happened in this election: Only two of the three candidates would have won any states.  Additionally, I do not understand why spelling counts in counting ballots (and also it was a good thing Hank Aaron was not on the ballot).  Beyond that when the national press discovers that according to the exit polls the vast majority of people who voted for the President-Elect apparently lied about it and that the candidates always finished in the same order, they should have figured something was amiss.  Do not even get me started on how Delacroy's public statements would blow up in their faces, but that is just another nail in the coffin of this film.

The net result is that ultimately the funny sides and the serious sides of ""Man of the Year"" do not jell.  Even though Williams and Linney make their characters believable the situation quickly goes beyond their grasp.  The more I think about it the more I am convinced that Dobbs would have dialed back the comedy after election day, to wit, more like what he did in his responses to the press when they went after his past than the whole bit with the powdered wig.  The key difference is having a point to the comedy that critiques politics and not merely to make jokes about politics.  This brings me back to the beginning and my desire to believe that not only could somebody like Tom Dobbs be elected President of the United States, but that it would be a good thing and not a bad thing (and not be default).  Unfortunately, ""Man of the Year"" does not share that conviction regarding its own title character.",1172016000,3,5199,4.635076252723311

The story is a deep one about doing the right thing and being yourself.  Robin Williams is the only actor in my opinion that could have pulled this off.  If you're looking for a movie with a great story with humor thrown in this is the movie for you.  If you're looking for a movie to watch only for laughs I recommend picking up a Chris Farley classic.  For myself, I loved the story and I loved everything Robin Williams.

If the movie had stuck to one genre, such as comedy, satire, or drama it would have been much better, but instead it tries to mix the three with less than satisfactory results.

2704192,2,B000LC5B7O,"I waltzed into the theatre hoping to be dazzled with brilliance and comedic antics of politics by Robin Williams, Lewis Black and one of my favorite actors; Christopher Walken.  What I ended up getting was a half-attempt at a mixture between the Manchurian Candidate and a college political satire.

Man of the Year (MOY) advertised itself as a political comedy about a political pundit and demagogue running, winning an election and being president.  The trailers and commercials are misnomers as the timeline is between the Septermber of election year (sometime in the not-so distant future) until January so we do not go into Robin William's character (Dobbs) actually making it in the Oval Office.  This proved very disapointing as I looked forward to seeing Dobb's cabinet, policies etc... something the audience will not see.  So MOY advertises itself as something it is not, major bummer points there.

Furthermore, the plot is not comedic in nature but an actually thriller... or an attempt to be one.  From a group of assailants chasing down Linney's character in DC to her having a narcotics breakdown in her work cafeteria, MOY tries to attempt a Manchurian Candidate (remake) evil corporate America picture that just isn't all that convincing.  MOY seems to jump in and out of comedy to thriller, something that just doesn't work.  The movie would be fixed on the comedic antics of Dobbs describing his ""relationship"" to Linney's character in the form of Bill Clinton antics (you can figure that one out), then jump right into a thriller moment.  You cannot mix the two haphazardly as it takes away from any mindset.

The humour was not bad.  I think I was the only one in the theatre (which consisted of six people, including my friend and I) that laughed at the popular culture references Dobbs repeatedly made.  In one particular scene, Dobbs appears on the Saturday Night Live Weekend Update (something that also died long ago) with Tina Fey.  The jokes they made were quite dull save for the underwear jokes on Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.  Other than that, most of the jokes were lousy or played over and over in the commercials to the point where they lost their humour.

Character developement just didn't happen.  You learned about Dobb's ex-wife (or so we're led to believe) but that's it; no Lewis Black character developement (whose name I didn't even catch) and the plot with Walken's character ended very soon into the movie and lost its touch.  The movie also ended very, very, VERY abruptly to the point where you're confused about this sudden black screen and then you realize those text blocks emerging from below are the credits.

Dobb's character lost a lot of credibility when he hijacked the debate and wouldn't be quiet.  Granted some of his jokes inspired a chuckle in me, he was mocking a highly respected debate and used his position in an almost tyranical way similar to a filibuster.  At this time, someone in the theatre shouted, ""will he shut up already and get on with the movie?""  I couldn't have agreed more and I think that comment sparked more laughter than the film.

To MOY's defense though, there were some funny parts such as Walken's impression of political debates and the popular culture references but many of these were used as scenes in the overly-shown trailers and TV commercials.  This movie could've been a lot better but fell greatly short to anything.  I would've rather been dazzled by brilliance than BS, which is what this film is.",1162252800,5,3501,4.863406408094435
2704193,2,B000LC5B7O,"Combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times. LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention Albert Brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal. But MAN OF THE YEAR can't come close by comparison. It has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable.

The premise initially seemed very promising. Put a Jon Stewart-like comedy news guy up for President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is pressured into running by his audience. Along with him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK), and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Seeming to have very little chance at a successful run, Tom Dobbs amazingly wins the election.

But did he?

Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. She finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to get to President-elect Dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming, too). Dobbs goes onto Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, thus removing himself as the newly elected President and ending the careers of those at the computer company ...oh, and saving Ms. Green's life.

Does any of this sound funny?

The comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward. Robin Williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became President bears down on him.

The message of the film is interesting and debatable, too: that special interest owns presidential candidates. I'm sure there's substantial truth in this, and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could. If you wanted to make a comedy about you could. But Man of the Year isn't it.",1161820800,6,2278,4.843187660668381
2704194,2,B000LC5B7O,"""Man of the Year"" is a creepy hybrid of talk-show chatter and a political thriller. A bunch of monologues and comedy club improvisation hung on dental floss for these stunning revelations: politicians lie, power corrupts and electronic voting machines are flawed.

Robin Williams mails it as Tom Dobbs, a ""Daily Show""-type political comedian who runs for president and wins. His platform, discussed at length with his aides (Lewis Black and Christopher Walken) is simply no special interests! No advertising! Dobbs talks up environment a bit, but mostly he ridicules his opponents in a showy debate that immediately brands ""Man of the Year"" a shameless, cynical pander equal to any candidate.

Meanwhile, computer engineer Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) discovers a glitch in her company's touch-screen voting system that unfairly delivers Dobbs the victory. She informs her boss and his counsel (Jeff Goldblum) of the error and is summarily terrorized, drugged, defamed and nearly murdered for her whistle blowing.

Who's going to believe her? Eleanor points to Dobbs on TV.

""He will,"" she says.

This is another big misfire for writer-director Barry Levinson. His Baltimore trilogy - ""Diner,"" ""Avalon"" and ""Liberty Heights"" - is bittersweet with evocative portraits of the city's working-class history, while ""Toys"" and ""Envy"" are puerile ""expos of modern culture. In ""Man of the Year,"" he mixes sitcom with Eleanor's uncomfortable nervous breakdown in the company cafeteria.

Linney gives a surprisingly vulnerable performance, but it shames every other actor in the otherwise snarky picture. That includes Williams, whose Dobbs is a mix of id and humility without much wit or clue. Does he have a vice president, a grasp on foreign policy, a thought in his head that didn't come from some midnight ""all the world's ills"" conversation at Village Inn?

Levinson is not really interested in the guts of the presidency anyway; we have endless ""West Wing"" reruns for that. He seems more concerned with electoral corruption. Both the Democratic and Republican parties fight for that political inch in ways more insidious, subtle, subversive and ridiculous than the movie depicts.
