8609227,5,B00ET9D4SS,"I got this for my 3.5 year old daughter and it was her Christmas favorite this year(and she still wants to watch it). I was a teenager when the first VeggieTales came out, so they are not new to me. I wanted to share a fun safe choice for Christmas that would talk about the true meaning of Christmas in a way my daughter would understand. This video was perfect to aid in teaching her about Christmas. And I found it didn't get annoying like so many children's shows do nowadays. I highly recommend it!",1484697600,,503,4.3052631578947365
