8000494,5,B0000DBJCU,I have not been to a chiropractor since I got the dvd!,1446940800,,54,3.5833333333333335
8000495,3,B0000DBJCU,"While I love the workout and that is something I'm likely to do more because it is a short duration of time, I keep buying DVDs that won't play after a few times. The first DVD I bought worked perfectly for a long time, but I loaned it out. The next two DVDs that I bought have not worked. All were bought from amazon. I'm not buying any more.",1437264000,,343,3.9855072463768115

8000497,1,B0000DBJCU,I was disappointed because this is a yoga program and I did not want to buy a yoga DVD. Iit did not say on the cover so I had not realized it till I played it. It should have said it clearly on the front!,1411862400,,204,3.5555555555555554

8000499,4,B0000DBJCU,"If you have followed a few Rodney Yee programs, you might recognize these repackaged routines that were originally sold separately as VHS tapes.  Back Care Yoga is about 20 minutes, and helped get me through a few years of back pain with some easy, gentle but effective stretching.  The relaxation portion almost always drops me into a deep 5-minute nap.  Upper Body Yoga is 25 minutes of more vigorous poses that limber and strengthen your upper torso.  This routine is a bit more challenging, but closer to beginner than intermediate in difficulty.  Both are perfect if you are crunched for time, but want to squeeze in a little yoga.  As the title states, these programs target your core and upper body.  While Upper Body Yoga does engage the legs a little bit, neither program is truly a full-body routine.  Still, I really recommend this DVD for people who want a quick, high-quality routine that focuses on the spine and up.",1364774400,,930,4.76875
8000500,4,B0000DBJCU,"These are two down-to-earth functional and practical routines that someone with little experience but decent flexibility and strength can do.  Best yet, they really work!  I'm a runner - perpetually stiff and sore - and these routines keep me working smoothly.  I've tried classes but have not found an instructor that puts together a routine as effective as this.",1248739200,,364,5.135593220338983
8000501,2,B0000DBJCU,"There are 2 workouts on this DVD - one for back health and one for upper body. However, I was expecting something entirely different. I think I was expecting a vinyasa workout with a focus on upper body and back strength.

Plus, this is supposed to be a video for beginners. But, I am experienced at yoga and I can't even do some of these moves. Wheel!? I took yoga for over a year and didn't have enough strength to do Wheel pose! I think this could be very intimidating for newbies who dont' understand that it's OK to not be able to do some exercises. And no alternate modified poses were offered in it's place.

Ye is a calming instructor, but I don't love this video for more than light stretching.",1224806400,4,703,4.318181818181818
8000502,2,B0000DBJCU,"Despite the fact that it says it's for beginners, it's not. Many of the poses are very difficult for someone with little yoga experience.",1179619200,7,137,4.75
