8356207,5,B0028FPZ0A,"I enjoyed this movie more than the movie it is so much like - Oceans Eleven.  Ca$h has all sorts of twists and turns, a terriffic cast and beautiful actors and actresses and locales and cars and golf courses and clothes and gee, what else could you want?  Jean Dujardin and Jean Reno are really great, playing off each other with a wink and a smile but with more panache and none of the  smirking and gloating that annoyed me with Oceans Eleven. Just who is conning who in this?  The pace of the movie keeps you riveted  right up to the end.  Worth searching out for sure!",1366156800,4,572,4.25
8356208,4,B0028FPZ0A,"Very enjoyable. Con-artist inspired movies like 'House Of Games' and 'Grifters' tend to reflect realism - so they're understandably gritty, dark, and end without happiness. But the flip side of this genre are the comical scams; the bunko that employs humor in place of truth, and the flip side of truth is often much more pleasant. This flick is reminiscent of other genre favorites like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shooting-Fish/dp/6305248893/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shooting Fish</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Freshman/dp/0767810848/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Freshman</a>'.

Screened because I'm a huge fan of Jean Reno, but also because I've only recently learned of Monsieur Jean Dujardin - whose acting creds span a wide variety of roles and projects. Though he's mostly known for his action/comedies, I would equate him to a Matt Damon-type of actor, equally adept and believable at many different types of films and characters. And testament to his skill: He earned a stunning Best Actor Csar Award nomination in a *comedy*. An unprecedented and completely stunning event given the notoriously snobbish French film jurists. Now that's some mad acting skills.

In this flick we're introduced to Dujardin's character, the handsome and clever Cash, a nom de plume for a man who has the desire, ability and skill to obtain copious amounts of folding money by unscrupulous means. He's a con-artist extraordinaire who is about to meet his match in the shape of Max, Reno's character; the man long considered by Interpol as the continent's premier thief. A consideration that grates against Cash's ego to no end.

It's a competition of the highest caliber, dueling egos and grift skills are put to the ultimate test: Who's the best con-man? And who can take down the score of a lifetime in the form a blood-diamond dealer holding nearly a quarter billion dollars worth of the shiny mineral? Notably, the men who operate in this black market aren't internet tough guys, they're third-world mercenaries who happily settle their accounts with blades and bullets. These aren't the types who are going to yell at you - they'll just take a machete to one of your appendages and chop it off. So you don't mess with these dudes unless you regularly swim in the deep end of the suffering pool.

Clearly, these aren't typical marks to ply a con. But that is Max's plan - and Cash decides he wants in - or does he? And paying attention to details, as in all scams, is very important. Never get distracted, especially if that distraction is pretty. <g>

Like the grifter's favorite card game, this film is the visual equivalent of Three-Card Monte. Meaning: Even if you make the correct choice - you'll still lose.

Had a great deal of fun trying to figure out whose skills were better, who played the game better, and ultimately who gets left holding the short end of the stick. (laughing)

Funny thing about the French, there's no middle ground with their films. It's either a home run or a strike out with no other outcome. And when they do make contact - it's literally rocketing out of the stadium. I've recently screened a half dozen Franco productions, and they were all a premium cut above excellent.

Cleverly done and an outstanding addition to any grift/con movie collection.",1311379200,11,3379,5.232902033271719
8356209,4,B0028FPZ0A,"Ca$h is a 2008 French caper film starring Jean Dujardin, Jean Reno, Valerie Golino, with Francois Berleand and Ciaran Hinds.

Jean Dujargin (1972) works essentially in French films. He was nominated for a French Oscar for ""OSS 117"" (2006). Dujardin plays a small time grafter whose brother is killed during a sting.

France's finest actor Jean Reno (1948) is best known to American audiences from his great role in Luc Besson's films - ""La Femme Nikita"" (1990) and ""Leon"" (1994), which was released in the US as ""The Professional"" (it was Natalie Portman's first film). He was nominated 3 times for a French Oscar. He is active in US films including appearances in ""The Pink Panther"" (2006, 2009), ""The DaVInci Code"" (2006), and ""Rollerball"" (2002). Reno plays a legendary grafter who joins forces with Dujardin to steal $12 million in Euros from South Africans.

The beautiful Valeria Golino (1966) is best known to Americans as Tom Cruise's girlfriend from ""Rain  Man"" (1988) or Charlie Sheen's  girlfriend from ""Hot Shots"" (1991) and ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" (1993). Golino plays a police Lieutenant who may or may not be on the take.

Francois Berleand (1952) plays the French inspector in Jason Stratham's ""The Transporter"" series. He won one French Oscar (""My Little Business"") and was nominated two more times. Berleand plays an old friend of Dujardin.

Ciaran Hinds (1953) is an Irish actor who speaks impeccable French. American audiences will know him best from his role as Caesar in the TV series ""Rome"" (2005-7) and from films such as ""The Rite"" (2011) in which he played the head priest, ""Munich"" (2005) in which he played an assassin, and ""Amazing Grace"" (2007) in which he played an abolitionist.

The film moves at a quick pace and there are lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. In addition, the lavish surroundings are pleasing on the eyes, as are the two female stars, Valeria Golino and Alice Taglioni. The acting is all first rate.",1301702400,9,1959,4.897280966767371
8356210,4,B0028FPZ0A,"Charming ""caper"" type film about a sting operation that has several plot twists to the very end. Very entertaining, a sort of French response to George Roy Hill's ""The Sting"".",1298246400,2,175,4.866666666666666
