6391249,5,B00JV054BA,"Let me start this off by saying you should probably absolutely watch this movie before allowing your young children to watch it. This is in no way discrediting the movie itself, just a general suggestion. Moving forward, in attempt to avoid any spoilers or direct turns in the advanced plot, let me just paint the picture of the movies overall play back and character development, as well as the plot and some other small points.

The overall playback quality is a bit older but taking into consideration the time when this movie was created, the animation is astoundingly lovely to the eyes. Everything is smooth and flowing, and the anatomy in all animals displayed is generally very spot on for the style. In the beginning the little lamb, whos the main character, is very toon like  this fits the theme at the time. However, as he grows and the film gets darker, the plot thicker, we can see a complete overhaul of the actual style in which the anatomy is presented. This is a wonderful mood setter, very impressive.

Because the artistic style tends to mirror the character, we see extreme levels of character development almost right off the bat. The story wastes no time in getting you absolutely invested in the characters, while providing, towards the end, several different end all results and conclusions. Some choices may catch you off guard and confuse you at first, but overall the progression of each character is charmingly well played.

Now, the plot itself, as it began, was very overplayed (or so I believed). As I watched, rest assured my hopes for this film were not very high whatsoever. I felt myself groaning and grooling over, what I assumed to be, such a predictable plot and two dimensional characters. I think I noticed myself getting a bit surprised by the turns of the story 2/3s of the way through  and by that point, I wasn't sure HOW the movie was going to turn out. Given that, the plot was NOT as overplayed as I had originally anticipated. Rather, the plot and characters were very deep the ending was an ending I actually did not predict. Its not often movies catch me off guard more so children movies.

All in all, given all the situations and all the angels, I gave this five stars out of five because as long as you are up for something dark thatll make you think, this is one heck of a ride that I don't mind taking again, and I don't think you will either.",1424908800,4,2399,4.593457943925234
6391250,5,B00JV054BA,"This short film is one of my favorite movies and one of my earliest childhood memories. I saw this as a video rental when I was very young and I remember crying a lot at the end. My parents said they were sorry and they wouldn't show it to me again, but the film stayed with me. I tried to remember what I saw when I was younger. This movie started my fascination with wolves and old fairy-tales. I found a old VHS on ebay and it's better then I remember. It's cute and haunting, and it will make small children cry. But I think that's a good thing.

The movie itself is very short. About 45 minutes. This is more along the lines of an animated Aesop's fable and telling a tale of morality through the lives of animals. It's not a Disney movie with a nice ending. But I think it's worth your time. If your kids can handle a little drama, I think it's worth watching. I turned out okay.",1422921600,4,885,4.115606936416185
6391251,1,B00JV054BA,"Cinematically speaking, this may be a masterpiece.  That said, you will note the title of this review. Note the caps lock. Obey. The. Caps. Lock.

I sat down to watch this movie as a 5 year old and stood up 90 minutes later as an 80 year old man with sciatica and a prune-only diet.  If George R.R. Martin didn't ghost write this script, then it is no doubt where he draws his inspiration and possibly his life force from.  Here's a synopsis:

Here's an adorable little lamb/goat thing. Look how cute he is! Do you love him yet? You do? Good. Gooooooooood.

Now, watch as his entire life falls apart before your very eyes.  See him in absolute despair and pity him. You wish you could make it all better for him don't you. But you can't can you? Hahaha you pitiful, powerless child, stare helplessly in abject horror as your innocent little lamb becomes twisted into the very thing he hates and fears in the name of vengeance.  Observe his grim fate of isolation and guilt for accomplishing his grisly mission. Yes, child, cry, cry, for George R R Martin is thirsty.

My  parents can perhaps be excused, since in 1985 this was an animated cartoon sitting on the rental shelf next to care bears, pound puppies, etc and the MPAA on their haste, saw an animated title and slapped a G rating.  But here in 2014, YOU have this review. YOU have the power to end this films potential to curbstomp the innocence of another child.  If you do not heed this warning, don't be surprised to find your child in the corner of there room in the fetal position, wearing black lipstick and eyeliner and listening to the cure.",1418515200,12,1607,4.447098976109215
6391252,4,B00JV054BA,"Interesting movie.  Depressing, but that was to be expected.  I'd alwasy wanted to see it and I finally have; not disappointed in the least.  The movie isn't for everyone; it definitely isn't for anyone that doesn't like dark and grim stories even though its masked by cute visuals through the  majority of the movie.

It was disconcerting for me, who has watched Unico a million times, to hear the same voice for the lamb, but it didn't affect the movie; just a little miff I had initially, personally. xD",1408406400,2,506,4.640449438202247
6391253,5,B00JV054BA,"This film is a strange bit of history; even taken in context it is an unusual film.  With a 45 minute running time and high production values, this bizarre farm-yard animal story ran side-by-side with the equally weird Mouse and his Child anime as a double feature.  Both films came into existence during the late 70's when it seemed like animated films could take on almost any topic, ranging from the Lord of the Rings to Heavy Metal, so unusual was par for the course!

Ringing Bell, however, does not just feel like another random idea thrown at the wall.  With Sanrio's reputation for creating and branding super-cute characters, Ringing Bell crafted Chirin, an all-too-innocent lamb whose story somehow becomes the analogy for something else...?  It is not so simple as the road of vengeance, but a rejection of weakness and the creation of a dichotomy between the weak (who must die, so that others may live) and the strong.  Perhaps thoughts from a not-so-long-ago defeated Japan somehow seep through? There's a surprising amount of depth, philosophy and sorrow for something that appears (at least at first) to be aimed at 5 year olds, and it is that disconnect that makes Ringing Bell such an oddity--although it is not alone in Sanrio's catalog.

The DVD, while not 'loaded', has both English and Japanese language tracks (both are quite good), and a highly informative commentary track.  The video quality is a bit fuzzy and probably could have used some restoration, but this is the best we will ever see this film.  I am elated that Discotek has taken the effort to release this and some of the other Sanrio films at a time when I suspect neither the films themselves or the DVD format is particularly lucrative.  Long may your passion project continue!",1405036800,13,1767,4.821192052980132
8653947,5,B00JV054BA,"I vividly remember watching this as a six year old child.  I remember crying my eyes out over it. I purchased this DVD it still had a very strong impact on me. I realize now that this was very traumatic for me as a child. I remember picking it up at the kid section at our libraries video section. This was not a cozy family movie. This was an animated video about the unfairness of life and the things we do to cope with that unfairness.

I can appreciate the DVD more now than I did when I was a small impressionable kid. It terrified me as a kid bit did inspire me to be tough.",1531267200,,580,3.9913793103448274

yes, its a sad movie. so is the lion king. so is bamby. this movie is truly amazing and i've been searching for it for over 20 years. please don't hesitate to expose your children to something that will appeal to their emotions, unlike everything else nowadays for kids that doesnt make you think at all. this movie will enter the hearts of you and your children forever.",1509840000,,515,4.202020202020202

8653952,1,B00JV054BA,"I'm giving this film a one-star rating as a warning about the dichotomy between its plot and its format. The cover and the fact that the film is a cartoon made by the same company that markets Hello Kitty makes it easy for parents to think that it can function as a digital babysitter for their five year old. This would be a serious mistake. The tale is profoundly grim-and that's coming from someone whose scholastic endeavors include relatively in-depth studies of the horror genre. Cinematically, the film is fine-the animation is good and the plot has a Greek Tragedy-esq quality to it that makes it suitable for adults who enjoy darker animated fare like Plague Dogs and Watership Down. It might even be an interesting piece for a philosophy discussion group that is studying Nietzsche, but it is NOT a good film for young children.",1471132800,,838,4.7465753424657535
8653953,4,B00JV054BA,"Children losing their parents in tragedy has long become a staple of animated movies since Disney's melancholy 1942 tearjerker, BAMBI, but it's rather rare to find an animated feature where a similar incident occurs, and the story doesn't end ""happily ever after.""  Imagine, if you will, that Bambi and Littlefoot never got over their mother's deaths, especially with no one to comfort them, but instead they defect from their own kind to join forces with the killer and become corrupt monsters themselves.  Do so, and you get the basic idea behind RINGING BELL, a rather obscure 1978 Japanese animated feature which, despite its initially cuddly setup, is as downbeat and mean-spirited as you'll probably never see from cartoons today.

The film, which barely clocks in at 45 minutes (making it more of a featurette than anything else), tells the story of Chirin, an adorable little lamb who, like most innocent little protagonists in a children's animated tale, grows up on a farm with his mother.  One night, however, a ferocious wolf attacks the sheep on the barn, and in protecting her child, the lamb's mother is bumped off.  Of course Chirin is a storm of tears, but none of the other sheep show him any sympathy.  In despair, Chirin runs away to take vengeance on his mother's killer, at least initially, then later decides to join forces with the wolf.  In doing so, Chirin grows into a ram, every bit as cold and ruthless as his ""foster father.""  But when the two return to attack the same barn one night, Chirin finds himself having a serious identity crisis.  Needless to say, there's no happy ending in store for this ""little lost lamb.""

It's beyond shocking to discover that RINGING BELL was produced by Sanrio, the folks behind the much more lighthearted HELLO KITTY.  How a studio who created a sugarcoated franchise could churn out a movie as dark and depressing as this is hard to believe!  To its credit, though, RINGING BELL does not look like your usual Japanese animated fare, but instead possesses a style that is almost but not quite Disneyesque, somewhere between that and Hanna-Barbera's adaptation of the popular children's book CHARLOTTE'S WEB.  Furthermore, the animation itself is quite fluid, running at a full 24-frames per second.

Aesthetically, though, RINGING BELL isn't just a gloomy tale, it looks like one, too.  A good majority of the scenes are very smoky and shadowy.  The final confrontation between Chirin and his nemesis/foster father in particular is painted with dark, dreary colors.  Adding to the somewhat disconcerting presentation of the movie are the character designs.  Young Chirin and the other sheep are very much reminiscent of the typical sheep-like characters you would see from a classic Disney cartoon, while having a somewhat stylized look similar to that of HELLO KITTY, while the wolf and later on, the adult Chirin are designed to look intimidatingly threatening and scary.

Surprisingly, too, RINGING BELL is a musical, but the characters never break into song.  Rather, the occasional musical numbers are performed by an offscreen male chorus, setting an appropriately melancholy tone to the production.  These are mostly done during transitional scenes, such as a tender moment when Chirin is walking through the meadow with his mother, and later on, as we watch the little lamb grow into a ram.  The one drawback is that the songs aren't particularly memorable, but they are at least fittingly moody.

There's a bit of a dated, old-school feel to the animation and the songs, but considering the glut of computer animation today, watching a movie as vintage as this is refreshing, at least from my standpoint.

There's even a dubbed voice track for the audience who would have little patience for listening to the Japanese version with subtitles.  Like the movie, the dub, too, is an old school production dating from the 1980's, a period when dubs were, at most, not very good.  Barbara Goodson voices the young Chirin, and unfortunately, her performance sticks out in all the wrong ways.  There are moments that come across as well delivered, but more often than not, her performance is too strained and unconvincing, and I found her voice rather grating.  (In all fairness, the Japanese VA for this character isn't much easier on the ears.)  Gregg Burger fares much better as the older Chirin, although his performance is limited to the last fifteen minutes.  Ironically, his performance, as well as that of Ron Gans as the narrator, are the best of an otherwise serviceable but mostly average dub.

For their part, Discotek Media deserves a shout-out for their presentation of this rarity from Sanrio.  The best feature is a commentary track from Mike Toole, who provides a lot of anecdotal stories behind the production.  For students of the history behind Anime, this is worth listening to.

Fluidly animated though RINGING BELL is, it's difficult to know who this story is targeted at:  children?  Adults?  Good question.  For animation buffs looking for a change of pace from the usual fare today's animation market churns out, though, this movie could very well be worth a look.",1470614400,,5157,4.988304093567251
8653954,4,B00JV054BA,"I stumbled upon a video review of this movie courtesy of Bobsheaux, a YouTube film critic.  While his critique of it was less than positive, I was intrigued and more than a little curious.  The '70s and early '80s were a weird and admittedly dark time for animation in general, with Disney floundering to score its next big hit and more non-traditional animated fare like ""Heavy Metal,"" ""The Last Unicorn,"" ""Rock and Rule,"" and the works of Ralph Bakshi (""Wizards,"" ""Heavy Traffic,"" the animated ""Lord of the Rings,"" etc.) gaining what would become cult followings.  It was only natural that during this time of pushing the boundaries of animation and what stories it could tell, anime would begin to gain a foothold in the US, and while it would be a few decades before it gained a real following, some of it would make a real impact in the '70s and early '80s -- ""Unico,"" ""Star Blazers,"" and others.  And it was during this time that ""Ringing Bell"" arrived on US shores.

I viewed this film as a curiosity... and while I probably wouldn't count it as my favorite anime and probably won't watch it again, it stands out as a curiosity and an unexpectedly powerful film about revenge and grief.

""Ringing Bell"" follows the story of Chirin, a young lamb who lives with his mother and a flock of other sheep in an idyllic meadow.  Chirin's mother warns him not to wander off or the dreaded Wolf King (simply called Wolf in the Japanese track) will eat him... but her warnings don't prevent the wolf from invading the barn late one night.  When his mother gives her life to protect him, Chirin is overcome with grief, and he sets off to fight the Wolf King and win revenge.  He's too weak to be more than a nuisance, but the wolf recognizes a fighting spirit in him, and agrees to take him on as an apprentice.  Chirin's path results in a dark transformation... and in the end he must decide what he really is, sheep or wolf.  But even if he makes the choice, what will the path he has chosen cost him?

Word of warning -- despite the cutsie title and the adorable lamb on the cover, this is NOT a movie for little kids.  It's dark, violent (though bloodless), and deals with some heavy themes.  It was originally released with a G or ""all ages"" rating (!), but I recommend parents watch it themselves and decide whether their kids are ready for it before giving it to them.

The movie looks ands sounds gorgeous, especially given the time period.  The backgrounds are lush and beautiful, the music haunting and lovely, and the animation is smoother than I've come to expect of most anime.  The sheep look like they've come straight out of Disney's ""Lambert the Sheepish Lion,"" though the wolf and adult Chirin both look unique and even pretty awesomely designed.  The picture is a bit grainy, probably resulting from the DVD being made from an old source, but I doubt this movie will see a remaster anytime soon, so I'll take what I can get.  At any rate, the picture quality doesn't detract from the beauty of the film.

The voice work is serviceable, though the American dub can get a bit shrill at times, especially Chirin's child voice.  Fun fact -- Gregg Berger, most famous as Grimlock in the original ""Transformers"" cartoon, voices adult Chirin.

Despite the adorable beginning and the beautiful backgrounds and animation, this film goes to some pretty dark places.  It doesn't shy away from the fact that death is a constant danger in the animal kingdom, and that not every story is going to end happily.  It particularly homes in on revenge, and how much it can cost someone who refuses to let go of the past and their anger, as well as what precisely makes a monster and, as Nietzsche said, ""he who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster.""  I also appreciate the fact that, for being the villain of the film, the wolf gets actual characterization, and isn't as much of a monster as Chirin leads him to believe.

Not a film to watch if you're easily depressed or if a dark animated film isn't your taste, but if you like offbeat animated films or are at all interested in a product from the ""dark age"" of animated film, give ""Ringing Bell"" a shot.  It's often melancholy and shocking, but will stay with the viewer for a long time afterwards.  I'd recommend it for children 10 and up, especially if parents have a discussion with their children after the film to talk about what they've seen.",1452556800,,4434,4.550377833753148
