2452886,3,B000C65ZA2,"'The Girl From Monday' offers a somber, thought-provoking glimpse of a possible future where ""Consumer is King"" and everything else, including mankind, is nothing more than a commodity. Earth has become a corporate run world and we are stock, or property that goes up or down in value based primarily on our sexual desirablity. Good sex enhances net value while failed copulation, or rejection causes de-valuation of personal worth and a decrease in buying power.

Jack (Bill Sage) who was once a prominent figure in the corporate structure has become a leader in the ""counter-revolution."" As he and fellow partisians fight the ""Powers That Be"" matters become more complicated when Jack falls in love with a co-worker (Sabrina Lloyd) and encounters an alien (played by the beautiful Brazilian model Tatiana Abracos) from a distant planet known as Monday. She has come to on Earth in search of a missing piece of her worlds ""collective soul' which was stranded here a few years earlier. Her embodiment in human form is a process known as ""the word becomes flesh.""

Can corporate greed and massive group progamming be overcome by a few conscious, free-thinkers? And what role does this extra- terrestial culture have to play in the reclamation of mankind?

This is not a film that stands up well to alot of repeat viewings, but it's a worthwhile watch the first time. It's the perfect film to see with a group of deep thinkers who enjoy dissecting and interpretating cinema late into the night over a good cup of coffee, or glass of wine.",1145232000,5,1536,4.8773946360153255
2452887,4,B000C65ZA2,"While certain to offend many of you with FoxNews sensibilities (a black/white world where the marketplace is king), this film comes down to a story of human beings in conflict with a society with which they grow disillusioned. Hartley is a master at telling stories through the humanity of his characters, conflict arising from context.

In The Girl From Monday that context involves a society which has become a ""Dictatorship of the Consumer"" where each individuals worth is determined by their value to society in general, their contibutions to the mass market. Personal pleasure is viewed as wasteful and becomes illegal, everything must be dome for the good of the societal structure. Freedom is defined as the freedom to operate within the determined social boundaries. Sex has become an investment in social and economic order, not a means of personal or romantic expression.

The resistence to this order is led by the guilt-ridden Jack (Bill Sage) who was instrumental in the development of the system. His attack of conscience intensifies after an ill conceived and poorly managed tryst with Cecile (Sabrina Lloyd), who ends up sueing Jack to recover some of her lost societal value, resulting from this ""unproductive"" activity.

Each character becomes persecuted for their own part in this denegration of the market, their subversion of the ""public good."" Whether it be Jack's paternal guilt or Cecile's naive romance with adventure, we know this is not about how things turn out at the end, but about they can remain who they are, or if they can discover their identities in the first place.",1134691200,3,1602,5.0606060606060606
2452888,5,B000C65ZA2,"This is one of the best films I have seen in the past five years.  Bill Sage is fantastic!  He has done so much great work but this it the best performance I have seen him give yet.

This film was directed by Hal Hartley who gave us incredible films like Trust, Surviving Desire, and Simple Men.  For someone not familiar with the Hal Hartley style of film where the actors speak in a stilted manner like in a Samuel Beckett play this film may seem strange but once you get used to this style you can learn to appreciate it and see that it actually adds depth to the performances.

I have always loved Hal Hartley films but this one is my favorite.  This film explores many important present day issues and concepts in a  science fiction format.  It was incredibly moving to see important issues like terrorism, security and authority dealt with in an intelligent, honest, non propagandistic way.

I can not recommend this film enough.  Every American should see this film.  You can check out more of Hal Hartely's (and Bill Sage's) films at possiblefilms.com.",1134172800,7,1060,4.585106382978723
2452889,2,B000C65ZA2,"What an unfortunate film this is. Not just unfortunate because it's bad (which it is), but because it has the potential to be pretty good.

The idea behind the film is really intriguing, and could make for a great film. Here's how the Possible Films website describes it: ""Hartley's newest digital feature invites us to consider a world where citizens are actually proud to be stock options whose market value goes up or down depending on their sexual activity. A world where having sex just because it feels good is against the law. A world where one's credit rating determines everything.""

Doesn't that sound good? At least, potentially? Too bad it doesn't live up to that promise.

I mean, yeah, that's what the movie is about. But it's done in such a poor way that it just betrays the whole concept. It's hard to name what makes it such a bad movie, but it's something that persists throughout the film, not just any particular part. For starters, there's the omnipresent narration (always a bad sign), which gets repetitive fast and really doesn't add much to the story. Which is a little ironic, because I'm sure the story would be almost incomprehensible without it. Blame that part on the script, which is laden with cardboard characters, inconsistent plotting and clunky dialogue. Of course, bad dialogue can sometimes be saved by good actors...too bad there weren't any in evidence here. The actors who did show up universally delivered their lines with a leaden clumsiness that might even make a soap opera fan wince a little.

And then there's the filming style, which was trumped up so much in post-production that the style was a complete distraction from the substance of the film -- probably because there wasn't much substance there to be had. Jerky stop-and-go motion, interspersed with still frames, nonsensical transitions from color to black and white and back again...it's all there, the clear signs of a director who didn't have the vision to make a movie in the camera, and tried to save it in the digital editing suite. Suffice it to say, it didn't work.

I watched ""The Girl from Monday"" all the way through, because I kept hoping that there was something there that would salvage this really interesting idea from the land of bad movies. There almost was. About halfway through, one character receives a sentence for a crime she has committed: ""Two years hard time...teaching high school."" My wife and I had a good laugh; that was a genuinely funny, clever, and unexpected moment. Then the filmmakers had to go and ruin even that by explaining the sentence with more of that droning narration.

This is a movie that is more than the sum of its parts. Good idea plus bad writing plus bad acting plus bad directing equals a really, really, REALLY bad movie, the kind of movie you might expect to see late at night on a basic cable station...and even then, it'd probably be a bit disappointing.",1132012800,8,2919,4.781746031746032

The themes are so ingenious and creative, but at the same time such a rich social commentary, that essays can be written about this film. I think those who did not give this film 5 stars may have misunderstood it. It has not just one revolutionary sci-fi idea for a look into the future as a commentary on the now, but several. You must stop and think about what is going on here. Every detail is a social commentary and should be explored.",1301443200,,528,4.3979591836734695

8095742,3,B000C65ZA2,"I used to really enjoy writer/director Hal Hartley's work. For my taste, though, he peaked with 1992's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simple-Men/dp/B0000YEE1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simple Men</a>.

Although The Girl From Monday is credited as ""A Science Fiction by Hal Hartley,"" it's still more indie than sci-fi. And that's just the final straw in a long series of missteps.

It's beautifully shot, and I have to give the guy credit for making an ambitious movie on digital video, but there seems to be no narrative thread apart from The Girl, who shows up at the beginning and leaves at the end. There's been some sort of consumer revolution that has allowed the virtual takeover of society by a media conglomerate, and Jack (Bill Sage) is the increasingly remorseful architect of that revolution.

A major component of the new system is the trading of ""personal value"" on the stock exchange. When two people consent to have sex, their personal value increases. (Sex without value increase is criminal.) Hartley dances around the ""sex as value"" concept quite a bit, but never really makes it stick. Hell, even the ham-handed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturn-3/dp/B001EBYBXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturn 3</a>&nbsp;used a variation more effectively:

James: Yes, you have a nice body. May I use it?
Alex: I'm with the Major.
James: For his personal consumption only? That's penally unsocial on Earth.

Unfortunately, because we never get emotionally attached to The Girl, when the greedy (his word) Principal Funk cuts a deal with her to use her body to increase his personal value, this outrageous violation barely registers.

There's nothing wrong with making a science fiction movie on a budget (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>--and then see it again), but a couple of black-clad corporate ""soldiers"" with cheesy B-movie helmets, Super Soakers and a black Hummer are not enough to set the proper tone for a futuristic or even an alternate-reality movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gattaca/dp/B0011UF79C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gattaca</a>&nbsp;was by no means a big-budget movie, but it set the bar pretty high with its subtle retro-future styling.

Hartley's evident intent was to make a statement about the overbranding of America, but he seems to have missed the idea of visibility. While it's often more effective to keep the monster hidden in a horror movie, here that technique doesn't work. In 1984, Big Brother is omnipresent and ever-threatening. In the Alien movies, ""The Company"" is practically a character itself. In our society, how are we kept constantly aware of such corporate giants as, say, Nike? Branding. And in life, as well as in film, branding means logos.

The interactive advertising (and blatant product placement) of Spielberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>&nbsp;makes the point spectacularly; Alex Cox's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Repo-Man/dp/B000BR9S96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Repo Man</a>&nbsp;takes it to the opposite extreme with its ubiquitous generic products. Yet in Monday, there's nary a logo to be seen. Instead, characters continually tell us about the Big Brother-like multimedia giant, Triple M--an egregious violation of the ""show, don't tell"" rule of filmmaking. All he really needed to do was hire a graphic artist and take a trip to Kinko's.

The best part of the DVD for me was the ""making of"" featurette. It was consistently entertaining (I especially appreciated hearing Hartley refer to himself as a ""craftsman"" rather than an ""artist"") and it was instructive to see how much Hartley does with so little. Unfortunately, the movie itself didn't live up to the potential displayed in the featurette.

Which is not to say that I hated it, but it could have been so much more. But you know what? Hal Hartley doesn't make movies for me; he makes them for Hal Hartley. And even if we don't always connect, I'll always respect him for following his own vision.",1225843200,9,4714,6.5296
8095743,3,B000C65ZA2,"A bit cerebral, most viewers will likely need to watch it more than once to pick up the subtle nuances Hal Hartley likes to interject in his movies.  Still, more or less an interesting story line that tickles the curiosity whether or not aliens from distant planets could live among us, and if they do/did, would the majority of us be able to recognize them?  Being a fan of good special effects in scifi, the low budget character of this film almost ruined it for me; however, you can rely on the charisma/talent of Sabrina Lloyd here to raise it well into the realms of the watchable again.",1214956800,,592,4.472222222222222
8095744,4,B000C65ZA2,"Part of the problem of being a conceptual film maker, is that your work is essentially an essay. Each piece is about something, and Hartley's back catalog is deep and great. Since Henry Fool (probably his best film) he's moved into digital cinema to cut costs. His first all digital piece The Book of Life was awful and probably his worst film, but he followed it up with No Such Thing which was a big budget film that never made it major theaters. No Such Thing suceeded, but showed that when Hartley is risking more, he puts more into the film. The Girl From Monday is Hartley's second digital release, made on a shoe string budget, but unlike The Book of Life it succeeds where the former fails. Hartley drops us into a dystopian future that essentially is the present. His characters don't exercise control by robotics or some other technology, but simply through libertarian principles taken to their extreme, neuro-economics, and the logic of commodities. In essence, they're an advertising company that commodifies sex into The Rebel Sell. Sex becomes a subsidy for competitive consumption.

The Girl From Monday's only major flaw (like a lot of independent pictures) is a little to much white space. We're at times given long semi-epic moments of solitutude to further reinforce the hopelessness of the protoganist's situation. While Henry Fool or no such featured such moments, they occur as background around the events and ideas of the film, here they take center stage similar to the desolation in Shinji Aoyama's films. The other problem is that it's digital, while Hartley's other films are beautiful, at times The Girl From Monday's low budget comes through, and despite the poignancy of the ideas behind it, it doesn't feel as complicated in it's consideration of the point as say Hartley's other work does. In other words, it's provocative, but the film doesn't ponder its points to their full ruminations. It could have been an even shorter film, or it could have been fleshed out with out as many pauses. But at 9 USD it seems priced about right, and for the amount of thought it will give you, it's worth a lot more than that. You'll probably find yourself handing it off to other people, hoping they view it too.",1209254400,,2233,4.815104166666667
