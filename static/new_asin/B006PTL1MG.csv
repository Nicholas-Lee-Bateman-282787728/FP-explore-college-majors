8502884,2,B006PTL1MG,"The Dude Bandit, 1933 film

It begins with a herd of cattle in a valley. There is a Quarantine Notice that prohibits all persons. Is this a scheme to oppress small ranchers? If the cattle cant be sold debts cant be repaid and a ranch will be repossessed as security for a debt. [Note that pot-belly stove in the hotel room.] Burton plans to get every ranch in the valley. There is a sound of a shot from a hotel room! Dad Mason had a gun in his hand, there is a note. Elsewhere a cowboy tries to break a bronco. Ace returns from up North, he will investigate the death of Dad Mason. Mason borrowed thousands to repay his debt. Burton shows up to claim Masons ranch and all its contents. Tex leaves by the window and rides after Burtons gang. Skeeter talks to Burton, who tells of is plans. Burtons men are told of the holdup. There is a chase (for action)! Skeeter hides. Tex returns home to get into bed.

Skeeter tells about finding a center-fire shell in a rimfire revolver! Something funny going on. Tex is very polite. He takes extra pancakes at breakfast. The Dude Bandit rides again! Burtons gang follows him to the Mason ranch. There is subtle comedy in the search of the house. [Would a real ranch house have such a big bedroom? Tex now has a bullet from Burtons revolver. He finds a new use for that trunk. Skeeter digs out that bullet from Burtons gun; the rifling on the bullets are the same. Ace investigates the ashes in the stove - he finds a rimfire shell. Ace Cooper visits the Sheriff. Betty Mason is told of a plan to save their cattle. Hank Perkins squeals - for a price. Burton learns this and makes a counter-plan. Skeeter questions the Doctor, the Dude Bandit appears! The Doc tells about the plan, Skeeter rides to warn Betty Mason. Skeeter uses his head, Ace uses his lariat.

That man tells Burton did it! Burton and his men ride towards Betty Mason and Mr. Brown. They are distracted by the Dude Bandit. There will be a happy ending. [The word dude was derived from the word duds for clothes. A dud was a well-dressed man, unlike real working cowboys.] Most cartridges today use the modern center-fire design, only the .22 continues with the older rimfire design. The Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming inspired many western movies. Note how Hoot tied up his horse instead of just looping the reins over a fence.

This is a good story but this movie has poor quality video and suffers from its lower budget. Hoot Owl Gibson was a real cowboy hired as an extra then became an actor (with a toothy smile). This is worth viewing as an example of the movies that entertained millions in olden times. Note the use of circumstantial evidence to solve a crime.",1405382400,,2680,4.441056910569106
8502885,4,B006PTL1MG,"Hoot Gibson was at one time the second-highest movie star in Hollywood, second only to Tom Mix. He made and lost a fortune several times over, and his film career spanned over 50 years. During that time he rose from stuntman to star and faded to character actor. This is one of Hoot's best low-budget westerns. Hoot always chose comedy over violence, until the final reel. Great fun for Hoot fans and B-Western devotees.",1373587200,,420,4.6891891891891895
