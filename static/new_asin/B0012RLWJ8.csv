8247425,3,B0012RLWJ8,"ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Alpha's prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and reasonable cost make it a worthwhile purchase.

Former Miss Massachusetts 1925, Thelma Todd is best remembered these days for co-starring with the Marx Bros. in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MONKEY-BUSINESS/dp/B000F04VV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MONKEY BUSINESS</a>&nbsp;(1931) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HORSE-FEATHERS/dp/B000EWHSJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HORSE FEATHERS</a>&nbsp;(1932). This lovely girl (known as ""The Ice Cream Blonde"") had superb comic timing and a voice well-suited to the new medium of talking pictures.

Events surrounding Todd's carbon monoxide poisoning death in the garage of her home have always been mysterious. One theory is she was murdered by some of the underworld types that frequented (and tried unsuccessfully to buy) her Hollywood nightclub/restaurant, ""Thelma Todd's Sidewalk Cafe."" Supporting evidence: nobody had ever seen Todd despondent or in any way suicidal. Some also believe that a corrupt L.A. District Attorney's office barely investigated and abruptly closed the case after ruling Todd's death a suicide.

Thelma's best abilities are NOT on display in KLONDIKE, one of her lesser films.
PLOT: Dr. Robert Cromwell (Talbot) is acquitted of malpractice in the death of a patient he'd used an experimental surgery on. Cromwell is later the only survivor of a plane crash in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. He's taken to Armstrong's Trading Post and nursed back to health by a young lady named ""Klondike"" (Todd). Her boyfriend Jim (Robards) has the same illness that Cromwell had previously failed to treat. The reluctant physician is persuaded by Jim's father, trading post owner Mark Armstrong (Walthall) to attempt the delicate operation a second time.

Todd's last movie was Laurel & Hardy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BOHEMIAN-GIRL/dp/B000Y5EM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BOHEMIAN GIRL</a>, which was released a few months after her Dec. '35 death.

8247426,1,B0012RLWJ8,"Let me begin by saying I love old movies. Thelma Todd I know from her movies with Zasu Pitts and Laurel and Hardy. A fine comedian and actress. Unfortunately this copy of this movie is terrible.

I have other movies distributed by Alpha Home Entertainment. Most are far better and at least acceptable. However, this version of Klondike is badly focused throughout the entire film. Dialogue is virtually inaudible. I can't believe this was the quality of the original film so it must have been a badly denegrated version used by Alpha. Alpha did their customers a dis-service by issuing this copy.

On the dvd case are these words ""Due to the age and rarity of this print, some picture and sound anomalies are present"". This is a huge understatement. Don't give up on Alpha Home Entertainment, but save your money and take a pass on this copy of this movie. It is an oldie, but not a goodie.",1256601600,7,890,4.591194968553459
8247427,3,B0012RLWJ8,"Thelma Todd, noted for agreeable performances as comedienne in a good many feature films and shorts, is effective here in an essentially serious dramatic role, acting as linchpin about which a complex life or death decision must be made.  A mainstay of the Monogram Pictures catalogue for years, the film was eventually lost, a print being latterly rediscovered as part of a privately owned collection held in southern Arizona, where the sere ambient had caused some nitrate decomposition in addition to other problems.  It was, however, for the most part successfully restored and, now a public domain commodity, has been reissued.  Opening action takes place in New York City where surgeon Robert Cromwell (Lyle Talbot) is being tried for murder, charged with wilfully causing the death of a patient following a developmental operation to excise an intracranial tumour, a procedure that Doctor Cromwell believes was, in reality, a success, although the state's medical board's opinion differs from his, and additionally with the court's finding of innocence, as it subsequently revokes Cromwell's medical licence due to the incident and its attendant publicity.  As means of escaping from his subsequent torment, Cromwell accepts a proposal from his flying instructor, Donald Evans (Frank Hawks), to accompany the pilot through Canadian skies to Japan, but a fresh and drastic difficulty is to be part of Cromwell's lot, as the aircraft slams down in Alaska, killing Evans and leaving the unlucky doctor critically wounded in a frozen wilderness.  Rescued by a trapper making his rounds, Cromwell is taken to a close on trading post, Armstrong's, where he delightedly accedes to the ministrations of the post owner's fiance, ""Klondike"" (Todd), whose affection is soon gained by this ruggedly handsome surgeon on the lam, to the distinct displeasure of her future husband, wheel chair restricted Jim Armstrong (Jason Robards) himself.  Cromwell's agreeable stay at the post is sharply altered because an invalid Armstrong is afflicted, in true Hollywood fashion, with precisely the same disease that indirectly propelled the discredited doctor from the United States, and smitten Klondike and Robert agree that he shall perform an identical operation upon Armstrong to that which led to Robert's loss of honour, a dissection that, if successfully completed, will clearly bring about the end of romance between these newly-minted lovers.  Generally considered during the time of its original showings as somewhat above Monogram's routine programmer stock-in- trade, the work for its initial reissue is given proper consideration, a satisfactory print being a result.  Notwithstanding this, an Alpha Home Entertainment version is characterized by woefully poor sound quality, much of the dialogue scarcely comprehensible.  Both Talbot and Todd are well-established and consistently creative ad libbers, and they play well together here, while the supporting cast is a cut above the standard for most ""B"" films, with one highlight an appearance of famed aviator Hawks, who during one of his scenes  describes in some detail injuries he suffered in a greatly publicized air crash.  All in all, then, KLONDIKE must be considered a largely studio-bound potboiler, but remains quite good fun nonetheless.",1210204800,3,3298,5.459724950884087
