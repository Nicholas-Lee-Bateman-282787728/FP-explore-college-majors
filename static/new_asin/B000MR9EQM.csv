2739513,5,B000MR9EQM,"Unlike many of the reviews currently posted for this film, which concern themselves with the ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" I am actually going to review the film that is actually on this page!

The Gamers: Dorkness Rising is a fantastic feature film with the best of both sides of gaming.  We get to have a look at both the fantasy world these people are creating for themselves, as well as follow their lives back in the real world.

Unlike other gaming films this one actually has a real point to it... Of course they are still out to storm the castle and save the damsel in distress (figuratively speaking), but the film is also about the game master publishing his first mod.

Unlike many independent fantasy films which come across as awkward, this one was like a breath of fresh air.  It's not just for the people who game, as the writer/director Matt Vancil easily makes the content accessible to anyone who might watch the film!  Even my parents, neither of whom game, watched and enjoyed this film... how many people can say that about other gaming films... *cough* Dungeons & Dragons *cough*?

All in all, it's a fun ride from beginning to end with an even balance of life in the real world as well as life inside the fantasy completed with a little surprise in the middle... I won't give it away, but let me just say that ""Everything is better with pirates!""",1220313600,84,1359,4.545081967213115
2739514,5,B000MR9EQM,"Somehow the reviews for Red Shoe Diaries got placed under the review listings for ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"". This has been this way now for well over a month! You folks at Amazon need to get this fixed!  By the way, even though your list states that this DVD is not out yet, it is indeed out. I've already ordered mine from another online vendor. You folks need to revisit and fix this page fairly soon. Most of the people that will be buying this film are avid fans and I would venture to guess that the largest portion of sales will happen very shortly after it becomes available so you're losing sales.",1220227200,5,609,4.389380530973451

2739516,5,B000MR9EQM,"I don't know how to get them to catch on, but despite the credits I finally got removed, and despite the reviews and comparisons listed, this is not, actually, the Red Shoe Diaries.  It is an independent feature film that has nothing to do with the X-files, nothing to do with any of the reviews thus far... it's a comedic fantasy piece.

It is so REAL and true to every group I've ever played with, and it's fun to match up the characters with your own players.

Just a quick warning: this is not a B movie. The production level is lower than that. But it's got heart, and it's thoroughly entertaining.",1516665600,,402,4.661971830985915

2739581,5,B000MR9EQM,"As a gamer of the late 80s, this took me back. It's a fairly accurate picture of the foibles that getting half a dozen different people together to make group decisions in a fantasy world would look like. It's hilarious and true to form and can be aggravating when a character does things nobody expects, but it is SUCH A FUN MOVIE.  I recommend this for any and all who are curious about gaming, old time gamers and newbies as well. It is really well written, the characters are great, and the characters striving to stay in character is something we all struggled with when we were newbies.",1514332800,,592,4.481481481481482
2739582,2,B000MR9EQM,"Quick suggestions.  Don't spend the first 5 minutes cutting in and out of crediting actors and sound and production and writing when all of them suck.  The constant pauses between one person finishing their lines and the next person starting theirs just gives too much time to focus on how mediocre so much of it is.  Oh, and over-acting, so much of it its like watching Dora the Explorer but with nerds.

Since, I tacidly insulted so much.  The music wasn't bad, the sound just needed clarity and volume adjustments  And the special effects were pretty good (incredible in comparison to the rest).",1512864000,,598,4.757281553398058
2739583,4,B000MR9EQM,"Good writing makes good movies. And this film puts most of Hollywood's efforts to shame. It's well written, remarkably well acted, and engaging from start to finish.

If you like roleplaying games, you'll probably love this film. Even if you're not, it' still a worthwhile comedy. Yes, there's the requisite lowbrow humor for the target audience... but the story delivers gentle humor throughout. Sure, some of the effects are a bit cheesy, but they don't detract from the story. (The director didn't try to get too fancy with effects, so they're not distracting in their awfulness.)

It's a fun watch... not overly predictable... and suitable for most viewers. (A handful of suggestive moments may be a little much for smaller kids.) I came very close to going with 5 stars.",1512777600,,775,4.953846153846154

You are unlikely to enjoy it. If you are, however, you should really check this one out. It is a low-budget labor of love that both comically and genuinely examines archetypes in gaming and gamers. It does a great job of depicting archetypes (and stereotypes) of characters and gamers alike. The budget doesn't get in the way of the delivery, and in my opinion it actually adds an earnest quality to the show that might not survive a more lavish treatment.

It pokes irreverent fun at a lot of the more ridiculous aspects of the game, and also says something nice about why it's important to play for the experience - and not just play to win.

2739604,1,B000MR9EQM,"I guess I am logged in under my son's account.  Be that as it may.  This movie was so bad that it was funny.  Emoting rather than acting, jejune plot, silly characters, but what can I say?  I did watch it to the end.  I do think, though, that you need to be high or drunk to enjoy this due to its very unsubtle, over-the-top attempts at humor.  Were it not late at night I probably would not have bothered.  At the end of the day (or beginning of the night), watch this movie at your peril.  It is so bad that it will draw you in and, at the the end,  you will wonder where all the time has gone.

2739620,5,B000MR9EQM,Always enjoy watching this movie wish they had the first one The Gamers with the introduction to the shadow. As a long time gamer the story has so many things in it that actually can and do happen when you do play the games.

This one actually cobbled the storyline, material,  production and acting talent into a movie I enjoyed watching. It's a great testament to the fact that not all good movies need to have a huge fanbase, get massive publicity, released to a gazillion theaters and make gobs of money to be considered a success. I'll be honest, if it weren't for amazon prime, I'd probably have never run across this one, but hopefully the people that made this will keep creating movies, as I'd love to keep watching them.",1505088000,,744,4.552238805970149

I used to watch Astropia, where the lovely Ragnhildur Steinunn J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir (formerly Miss Iceland), played a woman with zero geek inclination toward roleplaying games.  This movie, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising follows a similar format except this one brings more hilarity and zaniness into the movie.  I find some of the scenes ""dorky"" and ""geeky"" but altogether very entertaining.

This movie makes me wish for more opportunities to roleplay with others in different gaming systems.  I definitely will be on the look out for the third one.

This movie and this company ARE gamers and they make media that if FOR gamers about games.  It is so great to be in on the joke and see yourself and your story on screen rather than being the joke and wishing you had never turned it on.  The whole movie from beginning to end shows that nerds, geeks and gamers don't need to be the outcast loser to be able to entertain.  They can be the star the hero and the sexball all at the same time.  Nerds and Geeks are wanting a space where we are seen in that light and the Gamers movies really give us that.  They have grown a lot from The Gamers and show even more range when you watch Gamers: Hands of Fate.

Then Kickstart their next project because all their content is viewer supported only.

The pacing is good, the acting isn't bad save for a few standouts, and production value is good enough to not take you out of the story.  I came to this movie with enough role playing video experience, but only an understanding of table top RPG's, having never played one. I didn't feel this made the movie any less enjoyable for me.

As for the special features, I would say the clear standout is the psychological analysis commentary. I would by this version of the movie simple for that alone.  Some of the other commentaries suffer from too much fighting among the participants to get a word in and, really, just not enough talking about the movie. If you are listening to the cast, you want to hear about their experience making the film.  there is a little of this, but it's more the exception than the rule in the cast commentary. However, the psychological commentary more than makes up for it and I recommend anyone buy this movie not only for its cinematic enjoyment, but the aforementioned commentary.",1487116800,,1151,4.509615384615385

An excellent film that remedied me of my gamming years.
We should sit around the table eating homemade nachos and anticipating the dawn.

The film was as much about the people that play as it is the characters; however watching the mock characters having fun made me want to join in.

Be sure to look at all the extra goodies on the DVD.

2739747,5,B000MR9EQM,"I'd say this is the best movie made by gamers (more or less) for gamers. The biggest issues I have with movies about people who play D&D is that it's usually from an outside perspective, portraying the players as awkward introverts who absorb themselves in an absurd fantasy world because they can't handle their inadequacies. This does not fall into any of those. You see a good range of the kinds of people who play the game, and more importantly, the game is center stage, including all the crazy details caused by players.

At the same time the movie is completely relatable for people who do game, from the arguments about story vs mechanics, to the struggling DM trying to create a story for his players.

This movie is the second Gamers flick, and improves substantially on the wonderful original in production quality and the development of both players and their characters. Indeed, the same actors who portray the players also depict their characters, which makes for numerous hilarious situations. The movie takes time to develop themes related to issues that commonly rise in RPGs, notably tensions between the referee and the players (like giving pride of place to story versus rules), tensions among players who want different things from RPGs (like hack-and-slay versus actual role-playing), and even the gender issue (girls can game too!). While there is emphasis on the goofy and sometimes neurotic preferences of the gamers, these themes run deeper and add narrative cache to the flick. A worthy successor to a beloved original. This one is more accessible to a non-nerd, non-gamer audience.",1451952000,2,1022,5.276073619631902

Commentaris, Making Of, deleted scenes, ect. my favorite feature is that it is subtitled in several languages, including ""d20"". This subtitle actually shows what is being rolled and the result of those actions and rolls, including some true demotivational inspiration. I only wish that the subtitles were better proof-read (E.I.: Great Cleve?) and maybe had more flare than looking like it was text from an 80s subtitled VHS.

I bought this movie, knowing that it is available to watch free at the Dead Gentlemen Productions youtube page, and i would buy it again if something happened to this DVD.

For those who don't get gaming, it is a great look at gaming culture (or at least a stereotypical version of it).  For gamers, it is a wonderful celebration of everything we love about and laugh at ourselves and our hobby.

The movie is about a group of gamers introducing a newcomer to the world of fantasy roleplaying games.  The scenes switch back and forth between the players sitting at the table bickering and arguing about rules and treasure and the characters (played by their respective players wearing full costume) acting out the adventure, complete with special effects.  The jokes are genuinely funny and can be enjoyed even by non-gamers, but there are plenty of in-jokes for gamers, ranging from off-handed comments and methods of interaction to the clothes they wear and posters on the wall.

This is a must have for fans of table top gaming everywhere, and if you are not a gamer yourself, it is a great gift idea for those in your family who are.",1372291200,,1078,4.671957671957672

The players are getting annoyed with their characters dying, so to make it more fair, they add a new player, who happens to be a girl.

Without spoiling the fun, expect campy costume make-up, colorful-costumes and all around zany chortle worthy entertainment. I have to say, the cast and writing is what makes this film great.

It is a movie for anyone that's played D&D, any RPG (pen & paper OR online), board games, etc.  The story and characters are handled in such a way that throughout the film you will find yourself saying, ""We did that!  That's awesome!""  It portrays gamers realistically and humorously without being stereotypical or painful.

I don't want to give out any spoilers.  I saw this without knowing much of anything other than I had to see it, and I recommend going that route.  Please watch it all the way through, though, as it starts off possibly a little slow.  The characters seem biased at first, but that's all part of the story ... just let it develop and finish.

Definitely the best gaming film out there along with the first Gamers, Astropia, Demon Hunters, Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake, and The Last Lovecraft.  There are cool extras on the DVD, too. In fact, ""Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake"" has the first movie along with a bunch of other cool extras.

Don't forget to watch the movie with the D20 subtitles turned on for that RPG experience - that's how we always watch it now.

Why not check it out?

Extras:  Subtitles (D20, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Latin, Norwegian, Portuguese, Serbian, Spanish), ""The Making of Dorkness Rising"", Extended Branching (with 14 extended and deleted scenes), Commentaries (cast, crew, dev team, producers, Monte Cook, Sean K Reynolds, Ed Stark, and Stan), SJ Tucker's ""Playing DnD"" video, Outtakes, Galleries, Trailers, Easter Eggs, scriptorium, production notes, soundboards, and more...

PLUS

There is a potential for a possible 3rd Gamers film, ""The Gamers: Hands of Fate"" BUT only if their Kickstarter Campaign is successful!  Only a few weeks left to sponsor and be a part of this gaming goodness... FUNDED.

UPDATE

It's happening, ""Gamers 3: Hands of Fate"" with an estimated delivery date of September 2013.  Watch JourneyQuest Season 1 and 2 until then...",1345680000,4,2007,4.934328358208956
2740036,5,B000MR9EQM,"I've never met anybody who has anything bad to say about this.  Everybody I know who's into gaming thinks it's hilarious.  I myself watched it several times and it makes me laugh every time.

It's also completely unexpected.  These were a bunch of amateurs in the Seattle area with very little money, and they made what is probably the funniest movie I've seen in years.  Certainly the most insightful movie about gaming I've ever seen.  Though I do warn you you definitely have to be into gaming to appreciate it.

On the one hand, you find yourself wishing they had more money to do better effects.  On the other hand, you suspect that not only was that not necessary, but a lot of the movie is hilarious precisely because their sets and costumes are so cheesy, and that if they had been better, the movie would have had a certain serious look that might possibly have clashed with the cheap comedy.

The only slight put-off I had was that these guys are using 3.5 edition, so it leaves you a bit cold if you don't know what they're talking about (e.g., ""five-foot step"").  But you'll catch the wave well enough, as the Mexicans say.

There are two things that sadden me:

#1:  Unfortunately, most of this movie is available you-know-how.  This is unfortunate:  if you watch it there, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Finally I felt so guilty I bought it the proper way and have been very happy viewing all the stuff I missed.

#2:  These guys -- at least the core crew -- are still at it, though they have gotten away from the chief thing that I found so inexhaustibly hilarious in this movie:  cutting back and forth between the fantasy world and the gaming table.

This game group is producing JourneyQuest, which is quite frankly not as good. The charm from this movie is the way the ""real-world"" personalities are represented in the game world. JourneyQuest doesn't have the ""real-world"" aspect and is therefore much more exclusive in it's audience and harder for a non-gamer to follow. Dorkness Rising is much more accessible.

You don't have to understand gaming to love this film (though understanding gaming gives you lots more in-jokes to enjoy); you just have to understand storytelling.  Gaming details are explained in context of the story, and the plot and jokes move fast enough to hold the attention of just about anyone.  It's low budget, but the dialog and acting are both first-rate.

The characters are hilarious.  Just about any gamer can recognize the archetypes of the rules lawyer, trickster, cop, newbie and arrow fodder, but non gamers will also recognize archetypes they know: jerk, funny guy, straight man, heroine, and hapless sap.

2740113,5,B000MR9EQM,"To see this flick is recommended to all players of Dungeons and Dragons (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th... 15th editions).  Even if you can't relate to specific rules of the game (I believe in the movie they use 3rd edition) most of us gamers can relate to the blunders and ridiculousness of the party in general.  There is the group 'rules lawyer,' the somewhat evil yet playing a good alignment guy (also being a guy playing a female character), the noob, the useless PC who seduces every NPC chick possible, and the stringent DM who has a specific story in mind and wishes the group would succeed (which they have tremendous trouble doing so).

I have been told by one of our D&D groups girlfriends that this movie made it easier for her to understand why we play D&D.  It probably at the very least should be watched with a person who plays otherwise the movie may seem lame (so if you have zero relation to D&D and know nobody who does, you will not likely enjoy this movie).  Watch the movie with your gaming group for maximum enjoyment.  I bought this movie to support Dead Gentlemen Publishing so hopefully they publish more for our delight.

During my younger (14-19yrs) days I would play many roll playing games like dnd on a regular basis. While watching this film I can agree that this film has touched on some of the greatest parts of the gaming culture. Many films currently out on RPG's tend to portray gamers as these quirky, over-dramatic outcasts who have no other life to live other than the character their playing.

Dorkness Rising gives a fresh, not to mention hilarious view of the gaming culture (much like an actual sit down gaming experience) based with a good story and cut with some epic calls.

So far I've watched this copy twice, I was lucky to catch most of the movie on you tube and always wanted to buy a copy only it took their dead gentlemen video intro's where they answered questions posted on you tube that got me to finally order a copy!

As I've said I'm STILL working my way through the disc, currently watching the d20 subtitles which are almost as funny as the extended branch version of the movie which i watched and wondered how they kept those deleted scenes off you tube!

I heartily recommend picking this up, its well worth the money and next i hope to pick up Journeyquest season 1!

2740149,5,B000MR9EQM,"The Gamers: Dorkness Rising... What can I say?

All I can say is that if you are a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP), then this movie is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a great deal of fun.

The acting is certainly not Oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm. The humour is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done, if you can spot it). The cast are very down to earth in their appearance, befitting the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary hobby.

The quality of the movie's sound and vision are adequate, but again, it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the Dungeons and Dragons movie, written and performed by gamers for gamers.

Not afraid to use terminology specific to one system, they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie, but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner. It also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have about other gamers and deals with that quite well.

All in all the movie is very much driven by an well-thought-out equal balance of character, plot and entertainment (the Bard is amazingly good value-for-money).

On to the DVD itself.

Here we see one of the advantages to technology becoming so much cheaper, allowing people to self-publish. This is a serious gem.

There is just so much packed onto a single DVD that many of the larger companies could do but don't. The number of easter eggs to find on the DVD are about on a par with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. THe big difference here is that these truly add something special to the experience. That is another advantage about self-publication, they can take risks.

The picture quality is wonderful. Having only previously owned this as a download (naughty me... hold on... wait a moment... that wasn't naughty... DGP said I could download it, the nice guys that they are), it is great to have a physical copy. The extras alone are more than worth the entry price.

In the end it does make scoring this movie quite hard, so I have given it 2 scores.

Score (for non-RP'ers): 4/5 (A few moments could go way over your head, but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more.) The extras, however, can be enjoyed by anyone (over a certain age, in the case of the drinking game...)

Score (for RP'ers): 5/5 (Everything fits together, in the perfect quantities, and with the perfect charm and sentiment). Watch it, love it, lend it to your friends ... then threaten to do unspeakable things to their characters if they don't buy it...",1310169600,5,2672,4.54375

Okay, the budget is low and it is not a slick Hollywood production. But it is all the better for that. It's one of those movies that I purchased to support the filmmakers because I want them to keep making hilarious, quirky, fun, genuine, real movies. I am thrilled that it is out in a new edition.

The gamers tend to be silly, and perhaps even sad as people, but in a more realistic and positive fashion than the characters in similar movies.

The humor is fantastic for any level of dork. It also is not just a man's world, the female lead is a great character who isn't super tomboy but not a complete girly girl, a perfect in between makes her a great addition to the D&D universe.

2740205,5,B000MR9EQM,"Let me first say this: Going into this movie, I was expecting that I would be turning it off ten minutes in. I knew it was an indie movie, and I knew that it was about gaming. Never has a movie been made that accurately portrays gaming - tabletop or otherwise - without being silly or taking everything to the extreme, so I certainly didn't think that this movie would get it right. But let me tell you, I have never been so thankful for being wrong.

I've never seen the prequel this movie is loosely based on, but I understand this movie centers around the same premise: Just a bunch of friends playing D&D and getting their characters into all sorts of awesome predicaments. All of the jokes are terrifyingly accurate, and the whole movie celebrates all that gaming can be. Though everything was made on a very low budget, the filmmakers somehow managed to make a story and characters so absorbing and entertaining that all of the cheesy sets and special effects get lost into the background, until all you want to know is how the adventure will end. And it all does come to an end, sadly, which is really the only negative thing I can say about it; I wanted more!

I haven't laughed so hard at a movie all year, and it's been awhile since I've watched something that I immediately wanted to watch again. THE GAMERS: DORKNESS RISING touches on so many aspects of what makes gaming a lifestyle of its own, and does so without compromise or disrespect. If you've ever played an RPG, be it on a console or around your kitchen table, you will love this movie, there can be no question. This is a rare gem that deserves high praise for its laughs, its intelligence, and for being one of the only movies that shines a light on a pass-time that has long since been ignored.",1281052800,3,1769,4.423312883435583

Okay, probably not that last one.  I'd never heard of it, but it sounded entertaining, and it was available on Instant Play, so I hit Play.  And shortly thereafter, my husband had to ask me why I was howling and clapping.  I then made him watch it, and I watched it again myself.  Since then, I've purchased a hard copy both to support the Dead Gentlemen with some actual monetary reward and to force my D&D group into watching it with me.  Win!

If you're a gamer, if you know a gamer, if you like D&D, if you spend any time in comic book shops, or even if you have a decent sense of humor about such things, you'll get a kick out of it.  The jokes are clever, the actors are extremely likeable (even the ""jerk""), and it's very watchable.  Is that a word?  At any rate, the scenarios the characters find themselves in will be familiar to many who play RPG's, and funny to many who don't.

This movie sidesteps every single mine in the field.  It's a fun movie that moves seamlessly between a group of friends and characters that they are playing.  It's goofy and silly and touching (there's even a love story arc!) with surprisingly good acting and action sequences.

If anything, it added to the flair of realism. Despite its shortcomings most of the acting was actually serviceable or better and one guy ""Brother Silence"" (Played by Brian Lewis) was a stand-out! The comedy writing was tight and even razor-sharp in several instances. I may sound like I'm gushing but I gave it a second watch a few days later, just to be sure. One other thing, the people involved in the making of this film were obviously having a blast and you can tell. Their fun is felt in the viewing. I loved it!

No spoilers from me; the movie follows a group of RPG players and the Dungeon Master (DM) as they try to complete a difficult adventure. The on screen action switches between the gamers and their fantasy alter egos. As the party fails time and time again to complete the task at hand, they realize that they need ""new blood"" and recruit a new player (the ultra rare girl gamer). The adventure takes off from there, both in the real world and in the RPG.

This movie perfectly captures the feel of many game sessions I have been in (we had an odd group) and the fantasy environment is really well presented. The players include the ""rules lawyer"", an excitable cross gender player (a male playing a female character), a hack and slash fighter type, and the new touchy feely girl player. Their real life attitudes translate into some very funny game action.

A really great movie, and not only for gamers, highly recommended!

Not exactly a hardcore one, I only picked up the hobby in college and even then was never all that invested in it as many are, but given an opportunity I'll gladly sit down to take part in a story and roll some dice around.  The oddity of that last sentence should serve well to illustrate how difficult it can be to explain the appeal of the hobby to the general public.  Now, if I'm ever hard pressed to explain why I find the experience rewarding, I point people towards this movie.
To put it simply, this movie is the first movie about gamers that's been able to come off sounding credible.  The characters are all well fleshed out, the script is as hiliarious as one would expect coming from the Dead Gentlemen, and at the end of the day it's a very well rounded movie.  I actually watched this with my family, none of whom had any experience or for that matter understanding of how RPG's worked, and much to my surprise they all found something to like.  It helps that they include a character who has never gamed until the events in the film, allowing for a certain degree of exposition concerning the mechanics and principles behind D&D to be seamlessly integrated into the story.  It's a simple touch, but it means that unlike the first film it's really quite easy for someone with no prior knowledge to get some of the in-jokes.
Putting the script aside for a moment, there's a lot more to recommend this film as well.  The film was put together with a low budget, and while you wouldn't mistake it for a major blockbuster that budget was put to extremely good use.  Frankly the movie looks like it should have cost a lot more to produce.  The picture quality is very good, and the sets, costumes, and effects all do their jobs admirably in selling the film.  So yes, you're not likely to mistake it for something you'd see in a theater.  But it's at least up to the quality of a decent made-for-TV movie, which is more than a lot of independent films can say these days.
I can't really go into much more detail without giving things away, but sufficed to say this rather disarming comedy does an amazing job of conveying all the odd ingenuity, fervor, and joy that can be drawn out by a good gaming group.  Gamers will appreciate it , and non-gamers will appreciate it for the insight it gives into their gaming friends.  Odds are if you're looking at this in the first place, you really don't need me to sell it to you much more than that.",1253836800,,2480,4.38646288209607

2740276,4,B000MR9EQM,"Dead Gentlemen Productions started life as a bunch of friends goofing around and making zero-budget movies for their own amusement. However, after the success of their first project, Demon Hunters, in 1999 they got slightly more ambitious for their second, The Gamers, which was released in 2002. The Gamers gained a sort-of sequel, Dorkness Rising, released last year, which was a quantum leap forward in quality.

By the time the team came to make the sequel, their fortunes had increased. The success of their first two films plus another one in the interim (Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake) had led to them being able to put substantially more resources into The Gamers: Dorkness Rising. This time the movie is 90 minutes long and features much larger numbers of actors and extras, as well as considerably more impressive effects, costumes, make-up, sets and locations. Also, whilst references in the first movie to the actual game they were playing were deliberately kept generic, this movie is sponsored by several major companies, allowing real gaming products to be used.

This time around the plot is more involved. The dungeon master, Lodge, is trying to write an adventure for official publication, but his party keeps getting killed whilst running it. Power gamer Cass is determined to beat the game no matter what, and the party decides they need two more members to be strong enough to beat the game. Cass' ex, Joanna, joins the group and immediately brings about a change in gameplay, as she is more focused on developing her character then min-maxing her skills. Unable to attract other players (due to the group's 'reputation'), Lodge has an NPC paladin join the party (portrayed as being played by himself during the in-game sequences). The other two players, Gary and Leo, emboldened by the change in group dynamics, decide to play outside their comfort zones, the former by playing a female sorceress and the latter by playing a bard (which attracts howls of derision for the perceived weakness of the bard character class).

The campaign gets underway. The party is charged with locating a magical mask that has been stolen by an evil necromancer. Progress is hampered when Lodge and Joanna's favoured tactic of investigating the situation through dialogue and roleplay is interrupted by Gary vapourising everyone in sight with magic and Leo using his high charisma score to sleep with every woman he comes across, whilst Cass attempts to 'roleplay' his monk by making up totally inane 'wise sayings' on the spot:

""He who stumbles around in darkness with a stick is blind. But he who sticks out in darkness is...flourescent.""

Unlike the first movie, the game in the sequel spans several sessions and there are sections inbetween showing how the change in gaming style is spilling over into the characters' real lives. There's also a hilariously random sequence in which the structural conceit of the film (showing the real-life game and events within the game) is applied to a pirates-and-ninjas board game with interesting results. The writer/director keeps a firm lid on things getting too emo or dramatic however, with the focus remaining firmly on the comedy and the characters. The movie's highlight is probably a sequence near the end featuring a very unique kind of 'undead' creature which may rank among the funniest things I have ever seen on screen (and gives the film a single extra-half star below).

The Gamers: Dorkness Rising (****) is a radical improvement on the original, with stronger production values, a more ambitious script and the presence of more professional actors sustaining the longer running length very well.",1237852800,13,3662,5.074750830564784

Due to some technical glitches, I wasn't able to watch the ending, so as soon as I managed to get enough money together to pick up the DVD, I headed to the local gaming shop to buy it. I HAD to know how it ended!

I rarely am willing to pay $20 or more for a movie. This is one of the few exceptions to that rule. It is worth every penny of the $24+ I paid for it at the gaming store.

The first Gamers movie was awesome, and my gaming group inevitably quotes SOMETHING from it every week when we get together to play. I have no doubt in my mind that the same thing will happen with Dorkness Rising. It is HILARIOUS. Make sure you pee before you watch it, or you will be in danger of wetting your pants from laughing so hard. :)",1223596800,2,831,3.8823529411764706
2740312,5,B000MR9EQM,"As I've written on the review for Galaxy Quest...this is a movie written by someone who loves the genre.  It was a laugh out loud, spill drink great time.

Every gaming group has their poor game master, who tries to straddle the line between the story and each of the players and their egos.  The look on the GM's face when his story created an unusal but satifying character boon for his NPC was priceless.

Every group has the ego nut who wants to stick with the rules when it suits him but wants to bring out a light saber and a machine gun when he's in a tight spot--and ends up arguing with all the players and the GM.

Then there is the newbie who finds a way to make her character work and because it is her first and only character, refuses to allow that character to die--or the mission to fail.  This forces the others in the group to actually finish the campaign--and for the rest of the group to enjoy the game.

The other two players were also priceless.  The gender reversal sorcerer was too funny...how many guys (or gals) try their hand at playing the opposite sex and find themselves in the unsavory position of having to play not just a character but a creature that they simply have no idea how they think or feel?

But my favorite ""gag"" player was the second of these two players...who kept dying.  It is the bane of all old time gamers...once a player learns that he can create another character, he loses his edge and the need to survive.

Anyone who has ever gamed will see themselves and others in this movie.

2740315,4,B000MR9EQM,"If you're a gamer of any type and can laugh at yourself then this movie is or you.  The Gamers: Dorkness Rising is movie that spoofs the role-playing and gaming cultures that anyone who has ever rolled up an imaginary character or played a collectible card game can relate to.

The movie begins in what looks like a low budget fantasy film but this is just a setup to what the movie is about.  The first scene of the movie is actually what is transpiring in the players ""imagination"".  This is a going theme throughout the entire film, switching between the real world and the imaginary one.

The story of Dorkness Rising centers around Lodge, a frustrated Dungeon Master who is trying to write a gaming module based on the adventure he is running with his players.  Lodges frustration stems from that his playing group are more concerned about just gaining loot and getting laid in his game world than trying to advance the story.  So throughout the movie he is in constant conflict with his group, mainly with the power gamer/rules lawyer guy.

All of this leads to some pretty genuinely funny moments in the game world and the real world portions of the film.

You have the power gamer playing a monk and attacking goblin totems and breaking of its ""gobdong"" and using it as a fake nose.  You have the goofy guy playing a girl, who subsequently forgets ""in game"" that he is playing a girl and tries hitting on the other female character in the film. Then you have the other guy trying to play the character who lays every female in the game including getting laid by his other friend in the film that is playing the female character(two guys making a roll to see if their characters can bump uglies then high fiving when they succeed, even though one character is a female seems a little bit...off kilter, but anywho!), and who even with a surplus of character sheets ends up dying in the movie up toward the count of 30 times.  He dies so much in fact that the heroes end up taking cover behind his mound of dead characters to attack a demon.

All of these elements allow the movie to have a good sense of humor and lets you get to know the characters in kind of a unique way.

I do have some minor complaints about the movie though.  I feel the movie at times tries to be a little too serious in spots than it has a right to be.  These scenes usually are in relation to the character Lodge when he is stressing out about getting his module written.  To me it just seemed a little more dramatized than what really needed to be in a movie like this.  Another thing that I feel may put off some other viewers is that I have read elsewhere on the Net that this movie can be watched by someone that has never gamed before or has only a casual knowledge of gaming.  I felt after watching the film this may not be the case. I feel the humor by and large would only be ""gotten"" by a gaming viewer and someone who didn't know anything about gaming or the people that play them would feel kind of lost.  There were some parts that even I felt the humor was a little flat, and I game.  But maybe that's just a personal opinion.
My final quibble with the film is that I felt sometimes the actors really Hammed it up more than was really required, and part of that was intentional due to the fact that when they are in ""the game world"" they tried to portray it in a way that was over the top and I understand where they are coming from, but there were parts I felt that some of the actors tried a little ""too"" hard in this regard.

However, don't let these minor objections get in the way of watching what is a very enjoyable, funny movie.  Despite it's low budget they do a very good job with their set pieces, The Inn scene is actually inside of a car garage,fooled me!  The actors by and large are pretty good and deliver their lines very well.

Highly recommended.

2740316,4,B000MR9EQM,"I love Dead Gentlemen Productions (DGP).  From the original Gamers movie to great shorts like the Rap video, the Universe is Big, to their spoof on a critical review of D&D 4.0, etc., I have been a big supporter and fan of their work.

As soon as I heard that they had a new DVD coming out, I immediately went out an pre-ordered it.

I feel a little guilty about confessing that I did not enjoy this production as much as earlier DGP works.  In retrospect, it is not that the DVD is poorly done.  This movie was different than what I had expected.

It is a good movie, and there are funny and clever bits.  The production values are excellent, and there is a lot more polish in the final version than in the earlier works.

But, it is not what I was looking for when I ordered the DVD.  The DGP earlier works were just purely ""put your mind in neutral"" silly romps.  This one made you think a bit and ponder a message (that there is a balance between storytelling and hack and slash).

There is real sexual tension between the GM and one of the players.  There are jokes, but there are also some serious moments and conflicts.

To be honest I was never a D&D player - I was just a video gaming nerd who read a lot of the manuals and once coded my own role playing game. I did play D&D a few times with friends and part of the reason I didn't play more was due to their making up tons of silly crap that distracted from the game. Characters boning each other...bags of magical weed to get them high...so let's just say despite not being a serious player the arguments between players and the zealous nature of the DM in this movie were spot on to my frustrations in trying to learn this game all those years ago.

I absolutely love the cast - they are all mostly normal looking people without model perfect looks so you can really relate to them. Especially since they are also nerds with stunted social skills. Their chemistry is hilarious and the transitions from the real world to the fantasy world of D&D is really done well.
