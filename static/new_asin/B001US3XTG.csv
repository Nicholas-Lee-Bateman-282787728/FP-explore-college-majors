3803720,4,B001US3XTG,"If you think about it, the world was a vastly different place in 1996.  Bill Clinton was President, Dolly the sheep became the first successfully cloned mammal, the first ever DVD was released in Japan, and eBay listed its first online auction.  I bring this up because that also happens to be the year that Case Closed aired on Japanese television.  Here it is 2009 and like eBay, Case Closed is still going strong.

Funimation continues to bring the super sleuthing to the domestic DVD scene and I recently had a chance to sit down and enjoy the fifth season of the program (which aired in Japan back in 2004).

Released across 4 discs, the Uncut and Unedited Case Closed Season Five consists of 25 episodes (# 106-130) in a pair of thin packs.  With a total runtime of 615 minutes, the set includes a few nice extras: Character Spotlight on the Junior Detective League and a Conan's Gadgets profile on the lead character's Stretchy Suspenders and Junior League Communicator.  Finally, the fourth disc contains a nice assortment of Funimation trailers.  Language options include both original Japanese dialog (with English subtitles if so desired) and English dub both of which are in stereo.  The set is rated TV PG but is definitely on the conservative side of the scale.  I imagine that the PG rating stems from the fact that many of the mysteries investigated deal with mature concepts such as murder or arson but it should be noted that never is there any real onscreen violence or gore.  The same goes for nudity and foul language- Case Closed is a class act all the way in its ability to discretely present adult-themes without resorting to uncivilized tactics.

The show, for those who have yet to experience it, follows a pretty simple formula whereby the title character happens upon bad behavior that requires a good deal of intelligence to successfully point the finger of blame.  Sounds like standard mystery-genre fare so far but what's unique about Case Closed is that the lead is played by a 17-year-old (Jimmy Kudo) investigator who has been transformed, via an experimental drug, into a child.  The kid goes by the name Conan Edogawa after two popular mystery writers and goes to live with his friend Rachel Moore and her private detective father, Richard.  If you're looking for back story, I strongly recommend considering Funimation's Case Closed DVD Starter Set as the fifth season wastes very little time retelling past events.  Instead the show follows its tried and true formula of setting up intricate mysteries for Conan to knock down.

A majority of the 25 episodes contained within are two-parters where in the first of the two spends its full 23 minutes setting the mood and establishing the mystery.  The second part, through a clever little trick, breaks the mystery down for the benefit of the police (and the viewer).  Keep in mind that it's young, barely noticeable kid Conan who is actually the brains behind solving the crime but is forced to disguise his voice to sound like the generally clueless Richard Moore when unveiling the facts, motives and so on.

It's formulaic and has certainly been done before but with a track record like Case Closed's, no sense fixing what isn't broken.  Indeed, the show does have a rhythm that I can only describe as addicting.  The first few episodes had me simply following along to establish of a baseline of what to expect, later episodes had me doing my best to solve the crimes before our hero Conan and to be honest, most of the time I wasn't successful (perhaps explaining why I'm reviewing anime right now instead of working in a forensics lab).

Sorry Scooby-Doo, but it's the depth of the mysteries that places Case Closed on a pedestal when compared to American efforts.  Perhaps not quite as deep as those found in a modern mystery novel, (keep in mind, we often have a mere twenty-three minutes to assemble then solve a mystery here) Case Closed does pride itself on a pretty realistic criminal mind.  As stated above, the themes are more closely related to what we may find on say a prime time mystery series like CSI or NCIS than they are Inspector Gadget.

Peppered throughout the 25 episodes presented here in the Fifth Season boxed set is single, stand alone episodes (as opposed to the richer two-parters) that typically feature Conan and his young classmates working together to solve cases (the Junior Detective League).  While enjoyable for their more juvenile tones (especially the antics of the goofy fat kid, George), these episodes often feel more like silly filler material to the more serious themes of the big cases.

As is always the case (no pun intended) with this show, the artwork and visual style aren't extremely rich or polished.  Instead the animation is fairly simplistic but gets the job done.  Focusing on the show's beauty (or lack thereof) is truly missing the whole point of what makes Case Closed so special.  This is suspense-driven story telling that goes the extra mile to make sure each episode provides sufficient resolve.

The English dub is pure Funimation which means is just nails the little language details that make the original mystery fun.  I can only imagine the work, planning, and translating this must require to get right.  The effort pays dividends though when you view the finished product and literally forget that this wasn't originally written in English.

In all Case Closed Season Five managed to dazzle without any of the traits I usually use to judge solid anime.  Rather than flashy visuals or over-emotional acting, Case Closed sticks to the simple formula of letting interesting story telling stand on its own merit.  The cases themselves are often masterful in terms of scope, motive, and resolve.  An interesting and likable cast of characters is just the icing on the cake.  When you look at it that way, Case Closed's apparent success and longevity is really no mystery at all.",1241308800,17,5933,4.848214285714286

Review

I kind of liked this season. Unlike its predecessor, most of the cases were quite good, with one that had a scene that gave off powerful emotion. It looks like Japan made some good choices when it came to what cases to put in as episodes 100-123 (Japanese count). All nine cases, except for episode 113 (Japanese count), which I cannot verify because the volume that contains it is not available in my country, were pretty faithful to their manga counterparts, with only one obvious, but understandable, omission between the anime adaption and manga counterpart. I also liked how I got quite a bit of a laugh out this season. It has been quite some time since I have been able to laugh about something that happened during cases. However, the thing that I liked the most was that FUNimation consistently fixed some minor problems that happen in Japan's fifth season, which is comprised of the final 17 (18, according to FUNimation's count) episodes of this set and then some. Many times, the Japanese version featured next episode previews for cases that either already happened or are quite a bit further down the line and FUNimation replaced those previews with the ones that are the real next episodes. This alone makes me glad that I watch the dubbed version of Detective Conan, instead of the subbed version. Outside of that, I cannot really think of anything else without repeating myself. The fact that most of the cases were actually decent and that I found something truly funny, as well as the fact that FUNimation fixed minor issues present in the original Japanese version, made this season fairly enjoyable.

Although there were I things that I liked about this season, there are some issues. First, many of the issues from the fourth season set, such as the removal of the Next Conan's Hint segments, have returned. The worst of which was the fact that FUNimation once again split an extended length episode into multiple episodes, the victim this time being episode 118 (Japanese count). As I said in my review of that case, I was hoping that they would not do that again, after I had complained about it in my original review of the fourth season on Amazon, but they did not listen at all. As a result, I lost any desire to repurchase any episodes I would have been willing to buy again and the desire to cover episodes 124+ (Japanese count) is barely existent. Another thing that I found wrong with this set, which again involves episode 118 (Japanese count), is that they removed a scene that was present in the Japanese version and the manga. While I may have been willing to overlook this omission, I cannot because of a far worse issue that I will bring up later. I also did not like how FUNimation's dub did not make any sense in a few places, whether it be because of a mismatched dub, like episode 123 (Japanese count), or their dub did not explain things that were explained in both the Japanese version and the manga (episodes 104 & 105 (Japanese count)). As FUNimation is supposed to be a professional dubbing company, I expect them to not do things like this. The thing that annoyed me the most about this set though was like its predecessor, the box says that this season set was unedited and uncut. Really? As I said before in my review of the fourth season, if the box says that it is unedited and uncut, I expect it to be unedited and uncut. However, with how much was done in this season set, it obviously does not deserve to be advertised as unedited and uncut. Fortunately, the Viridian edition, SAVE edition, and the iTunes edition do not have that false advertising, so many of the issues I have this set are not quite as bothersome in the newer releases, though the fact that the two episodes that made up episode 118 (Japanese count), like episode 96 (Japanese count), was never combined still bugs me. While there are issues that can normally be overlooked, the fact that this set was advertised as being unedited and uncut, which made most them issues to begin with, really ruined my enjoyment of this season.

Considering that there were things some things to like, this is definitely worth watching. I recommend this to fans of detective, mystery, and crime fiction, as well as fans of Detective Conan (Case Closed), but only if you get the newer editions, which are not advertised as being unedited and uncut. As for everyone else, since this is the last season set from FUNimation, at least until they decide to release episodes 124+ (Japanese count), I recommend getting one of the other season sets first.",1404518400,,5459,4.617131062951496
8344881,5,B001US3XTG,"Case Closed is a mystery show about a high school detective named Jimmy Kudo. Jimmy was the go to guy for solving mysteries until one night while at an amusement park with his best friend and love interest, Rachel Moore, he witnesses a suspicious man in black in the middle of a shady deal. Unfortunately for Jimmy, the man in black's partner sneaks up on him and ambushes him. Jimmy is then forced to take an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison ends up shrinking him. Afraid that the men in black might try to kill him and those close to him if they ever found out that he was still alive, Jimmy takes on the disguise of 1st grader, Conan Edogawa. To get possible leads on just who these men in black might be, Jimmy moves in with Rachael and her hack detective dad, Richard Moore. Because he looks like a little kid, no one takes Jimmy seriously anymore. Because of this, Jimmy has to find creative ways to solve the many murders and other mysteries that pop up around him all while trying to get his old body back.

If you are a fan of crime dramas and whodunits, then you will definitely like this series. The animation was done in the 90s, so the visuals are a little dated but the stories more than make up for this. The stories feature clever plots and fun characters. I recommend the episodes ""The Moonlight Sonata Murder Case"" and ""The Mountain Villa Murder Case"". Both stories are intriguing as well as exciting. ""Phantom Thief, 1412"" is also a good episode.

Also, there are six movies in English that you can buy in DVD format on Amazon. The movies feature a little better animation and some pretty excited stories. I recommend the fourth movie, ""Captured in Her Eyes"" and the fifth movie, ""Count Down to Heaven."" Both are thrilling stories that will keep you engaged until the end.",1384646400,2,1818,4.506060606060606

8344883,5,B001US3XTG,"Case closed(detective conan) is in english. This is season five. I own all 5 seasons available in the USA that are all in english.  It is a WONDERFUL series! It is action, adventure, love, mystery, murder all in one. For any case closed fan or anime fan or mystery fan!! I am looking forward in Funimation making more. There are well over 20 seasons in Japan. They don't make anymore in english but you can still get your hands on the series with english subtitles overseas not in the USA.",1271894400,,489,4.433333333333334
8344884,5,B001US3XTG,"I really enjoyed this series (I know it as Detective Conan).  Regrettably, the audience in America is not as large so Funimation has cancelled any further adaptations.  If you want to watch Episodes 131-300 and beyond, you'll have to get them from Japan.

Still one of my top 5 anime series.

Think Encyclopedia Brown (you see all the clues they do and can solve the mystery as well) + gadgets as an anime.

Top notch writing.

Also the quality of animation keep getting better and better.  It has greatly improved especially in the past few years.

Well we can always hope the rest get released in America eventually.",1260489600,4,618,4.657407407407407
