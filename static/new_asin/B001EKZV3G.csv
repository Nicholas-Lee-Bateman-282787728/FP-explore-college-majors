3555426,5,B001EKZV3G,"I have to admit I love helicopters and airplane movies for the stunts and flying scenes.  Blue Thunder was a movie I first saw growing up and didn't get to see too much in reruns on TV.  Decided I needed to buy it to watch again.  If you have never seen Blue Thunder, think of an Apache fitted for police duty and that sums it up.  Stealth has some fast paced flying scenes with a good story about futuristic jets to which they add an AI so it flies itself.  Kind of like terminator the plane becomes self aware and begins to make his own decisions about missions.  Two enjoyable movies in one box.",1451088000,2,598,4.201754385964913

3555432,3,B001EKZV3G,"Never Heard of this ""Stealth."" Loved ""Blue Thunder"" the movie, vaguely recall that I watched the 'Blue Thunder' TV series.

Well, I'm of to search IMDB for "" stealth lucas biel ,"" ie: it would help me for Amazon to say: button visit the page for
'Stealth"" /button button visit the page for 'Blue Thunder' /button and have those links open new tabs.

OK, from the customer reviews? this ""Stealth"" seems to be something I'd like only while in the range of quite tipsy to a
bit more than drunk while ""Blue Thunder"" seems like something I'd consider good to watch while sober.

My memories are that ""Blue Thunder"" the movie is good enough to watch every five or ten years. My memory is what it is.",1376092800,,694,4.4140625
