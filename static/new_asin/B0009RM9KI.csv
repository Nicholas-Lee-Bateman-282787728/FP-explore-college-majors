2313576,5,B0009RM9KI,"This box set is a must have for anyone who finds themselves constantly thinking about the bigger questions in life, unwilling to accept the stock answers inherited from our past.  This title was made around the same time as ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" and has some of the same scientists, as well as quite a few others who will probably go down in history as the forefathers of the scientific pursuit of consciousness.

Many of the biggest names in the field (Hameroff, Radin, Newberg, Woolf, Tuszynski, LaBerge, Ramachandran) are allowed to fully elaborate on their research, theories, thoughts, and feelings, without their words being edited out of context to fit some filmmaker's silly theory, which is what other titles are often critiqued for.  If you like your science served raw, straight from the source, with no middleman spin, this series is for you.

Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA, spent the final third of his life trying to solve the great mystery of consciousness, so it is no easy task.  Nonetheless, the 20 scientists in this series have essentially dedicated their lives to the quest.

The great thing about this series is that it was not created with an agenda, which is the flaw in many titles, and which is antithetical to science itself.  Some of the scientists argue persuasively that our brains can achieve a quantum state, and that this state would allow us to become entangled, or essentially become one with, each other, which would explain a lot of the feelings of connectedness we have.  Others in the series offer complete counterpoints to this argument, with theories that at first sound even more impossible, but which may in fact turn out to be accurate, like Sevush's theory that each of our neurons is individually conscious, but that we need billions of them in order to amplify the signal enough to make our body move.

There are persuasive arguments from all sides, making this title a very balanced, in depth exploration of this exciting new field of study.  I highly recommend it.",1153526400,68,2025,4.8604651162790695
2313577,1,B0009RM9KI,"When I ordered this DVD, I was very much looking forward to viewing it, but I was very disappointed. Many of the speakers being interviewed were obviously serious about their areas of study, but most seemed unprepared. This may be because this seems to be a convention or conference, and perhaps they were unaware that they would be interviewed. One person being interviewed may have explained my problem with DVD best when he was asked what the best answers or theories concerning consciousness were today. He said that there are none...that we don't have a clue. I really don't get the impression that anyone interviewed on this DVD has a solid clue, and it is apparent in their interviews.
  The most disappointing interview was the man who said he studied body types, he gave Santa Claus a body type and Twiggy a body type, and that he had met a woman at the conference who had a rare body type which he planned to explore more with her that evening. What does this have to do with consciousness?
  Probably the best interview was the woman who was not a PHd., but a student( I believe). She again seemed to imply that there is no clue to ""consciousness"", but it would take a collaborative effort and open minds.
  This DVD would be improved if it were in fact a collaborative  study. It should have included or made reference to the important history of the study, including psychology and philosophy.",1152748800,37,1406,4.645161290322581
2313578,5,B0009RM9KI,"The ramifications of the theories explored in this series are intense!  Basically, the idea is that biology might have found a way to detect quantum signals, similar to the way it optimized neurons to detect photons in our eyes, which are made of neurons and are extensions of our brain.  If neurons figured out how to interpret light, then perhaps they are developing to interpret quantum particles, which are simply particles even smaller than photons.  If the brain can do this, then the feelings of being connected are real, and would explain why some people have these feelings more strongly than others.  Imagine the first life-forms that could interpret light, how strange it must have been, and unbelievable to those life-forms that couldn't.  It also means we would be connected in real time to other similarly-built life-forms across the universe.  Of course, at this point, our quantum abilities are probably so rudimentary that we only detect these tiny particles/frequencies the way a bat senses light, with little accuracy or definition.

This series not only explores these theories, but also entertains most other major current ideas of the small but growing league of scientists brave enough to tackle this exciting new field.  Most of the people in the series are top professors at major universities, and this is the topic that consumes them most, so it's very much worth viewing.  And, it might well be that some of these people and their theories go down in the history books as revolutions in science, the way Einstein and Bohr and Heisenberg and their original theories of quantum physics are now acknowledged as revolutionary.  And, at $39.95, this is a steal.  Most series of academic quality like this cost several hundred dollars.  The company behind it is obviously more interested in dispersing knowledge than in making a buck, which is a refreshing attitude.  This new 5 DVD version should be a part of everyone's permanent collection.",1125360000,102,1965,5.046439628482972
2313579,5,B0009RM9KI,"The original 6 DVD series is no longer available, even though Amazon still lists it.  It was discontinued months ago, so any stores selling it, even via Amazon, are not authorized resellers, and you may be getting a bootleg version if you buy from them.  You can find the newly edited, 4 DVD version on several legitimate sites, including [...]  I bought a copy and loved it.  It is now fully edited.

From what I understand, the 6 DVD series was released early, before the footage was properly edited, because there were people who wanted it right away back in December.  The new version, which is 4 DVDs, has been edited, and flows very well.  For those not in the media industry, all interviewers ask a lot of questions and talk a lot to the people they interview, but that footage is typically chopped out during the editing process, so you never know about it.  The questions and comments are necessary for the interviewee, so that any possible comments or objections the audience may have are answered.  That's why there was so much of the interviewer in the 6 DVD version, he was trying to cover all of the possible thoughts, questions, and ideas the entire range of audience members might have.

In addition, much of the footage was shot back in 2002, years before Bleep came out, and years before millions of general audience members even had a notion that there even was a science of consciousness, so the interviewer was on the cutting edge of the most cutting edge science on the planet, so cut him some slack already.

At any rate, the new fully edited 4 DVD series is jam packed with the world's leading scientists in this field explaining the world's leading scientific theories on consciousness.  There are no channelers or prophets, just hard core science with professors from major universities.  An essential part of my permanent collection.  Enjoy!",1115078400,10,1868,4.743034055727554

It's rare to find individuals who straddle both worlds - the scientific and the contemplative - so it's easy to get hopes up when I believe I've found a resource that (skillfully) furthers this dialoge.  More often than not, those hopes are thwarted.  This series is yet another example of the latter (thwarted hopes).  There were some wonderful moments with the interviewees, but the interviewer was extremely clumsy in his approach.

8065590,5,B0009RM9KI,"Newberg is the presenter who stands out the most after watching this numerous times. You can feel the sincerity in his presentation. Some of the others felt less sincere (or maybe more aloof is a better way to put it), but still provided lots of detailed technical info.

Mostly what I like is it does not take one perspective and shove it down your throat as ""the truth"" ... in fact several interviewed give diametrically opposing opinions. That leaves it up to the viewer to decide and I think that's exactly how it should be. And that's so often missing from science-based productions like this. Scientists are often allergic to varying opinions.

I've watched this numerous times over the years since I bought it (back in 2008). And each time I learn (or re-learn) something from the viewing. Gonna watch it again. So, it definitely stands the test of time and I'm glad I bought it. It will not become one of the ones I watch just once and am never inspired to watch again. So, that's probably the best testament for this video.

I won't spoil any of the details ... what would you care about my personal perspective anyway :) I'll just say that as a moderately technically-minded person who's not trained in any of these technologies (bio-physics-cosmo etc ...) I was able to learn a tremendous amount of what science currently believes on this planet. The interviewers were very skilled in this video. Minimizing gratuitous questions and maximizing content digestible for the masses. Several times they asked exactly the question I was thinking when I watched the interview ... great feeling of synchronistic connection with the video that added a lot to my appreciation for this product.",1350777600,,1694,4.834482758620689
8065591,5,B0009RM9KI,I think this is a fantastic work done by conscious scientists who are helping us to understand the forces at work in the universe.

8065592,2,B0009RM9KI,"Nobel Laureates, before leaving this vale of tears, search for meaningful and profound challenges. Many of them settled on the question of consciousness and the brain. Jack Eccles proposed consciousness resides in dendrites and ""psychons""; Gerry Edelman suggested that it is inherent in coordinated firing within 'neuronal assemblies'; Francis Crick suggested that, astonishingly, consciousness is nothing but the sum total of neuronal activity whereas Roger Penrose, a physicist, speculated that consciousness may originate from quantum effects caused by ""non-computable collapses of the wave function"" in the brain.

Enter a gaggle of second order theorists who took these ideas and ran with them. People featured in this DVD range from semi-crackpots (Hameroff & Chalmers) to researchers who  capitalize on their empirical credentials  with preening speculation (Ramachandran). Much of this speculation begun with a psychologist named Pribram, who imagined the brain as a quantum holograph machine that channels Bohm's 'implicate order'. Like Pribram, who had no compunctions about extrapolating hard core physiology  to 'quantum free will', other theorists happily invent their own theories with fancy sounding names (usually including the word 'quantum'). Hameroff is an anesthesiologist who combined the least appealing and verifiable aspects of Pribram's, Eccles' and Penrose's hypotheses into the idea that consciousness is subserved by quantal entanglements at the level of microtubules (cytoskeletal scaffold molecules that impart rigidity to cells). Never mind that there is close to zero experimental evidence for macroscopic quantum effects in the brain. Or that Hameroff willfully displays fundamental ignorance of basic brain physiology. Thinking, like Chalmers and Bierman appear to, that the brain is a quantum machine that ""collapses wave packets"" sounds cool but is also unsupported by empirical evidence. And the idea that robots will  build ever more intelligent robots is, well, worthy of manga comics.

It seems that these guys have created an alternate scientific reality that operates in parallel to peer review system and the scientific consensus. Tis' simple: you create an unsolvable, ""hard"", problem and suggest an unfalsifiable approach to resolve it - and voila, you get a plum job at the University of Arizona. To paraphrase David Joravsky -  Hameroff, Pribram, Chalmers and friends ""invent mysteries or nonsense, or both together."" The only interviewee who actually makes sense amongst this roster of scientific, philosophical and intellectual  pretense is Willoughby Britton, a graduate student.

I think DVDs like this appeal to people who like ""The Secret"" or ""What the Bleep"" by lending a patina of 'science' to the belief du jour. But it has little, if anything, to do with real science. Or reality.",1271635200,6,2837,5.672169811320755
8065593,1,B0009RM9KI,"A lot of top researchers talking about consciousness but...one of them asks for a chalk board or a piece of paper to write down a simple drawing!

The ""cast"" is uneven - which makes for nice juxtapositions.  My favorites: Hammeroff, Ramachandran and the grad student in her mid-twenties (can't remember her name right off the bat).  Hammeroff - an intellectual ""tank.""  Ramachandran - succinct.  The grad student - probably a mirror image of a developmental state that most who'll watch this DVD set has gone through - the stage of intense intellectual seeking and idealistically contagious impatience for a paradigm shift.  The interviewer models a marvelously authentic immersion in the speaker's subject matter while at the same time maintaining - in some kind of meta-cognitive parallel - the capacity for tactfully challenging questions.  This was fun to watch: instructional, informative, panoramic, intriguing and pregnant with implications.  Time well spent!

8065595,5,B0009RM9KI,"This excellent DVD box set documented interesting presentations on several theories of consciousness. The presenting researchers included MD's and other individuals with world class credentials in: brain research, molecular biology, neurobiology, organic chemistry, computers and electronics, test engineering, math and statistics, theoretical and experimental physics, philosopy and even some part time poets. Although this box set was a bit pricey it was a high quality DVD production hosted by a talented and intelligent interviewer and very well edited. As far as presentation it is a discussion of each of the speakers findings and does not include any screen graphics or other visual materials. Excellent editing does a good job of making up for this omission.

One speaker indicated that consciousness may exist in the universe and is something that we are able to ""tap into"" biologically in order to acquire awareness of self. Furthermore, it is partially explainable on a quantum level using the Schrdinger equation.  A good case for this theory has been made to the satisfaction of a significant portion of the growing consciousness community. High speed quantum computers are currently at a prototype level and only beginning their technological evolution.

I am excited by this idea because it opens up the possibility that a sufficiently complex machine can acquire some form of consciousness without necessarily taking a biological path. Although we all ""experience"" consciousness, there is no way we can really convince another of our own ""awareness"" on philosophical grounds. I do have to admit that as a practical matter, I am convinced of my own consciousness as well as yours.  Notwithstanding, that is not what the philosophers tell us, and I believe it may be rooted in ""existentialism"".

Since an early age I have believed that the future held two very exciting possibilities. Either we will be able to construct a fully conscious machine, or we will by default, demonstrate the ""spiritual nature"" of self awareness, as this may be something that mankind will never be able reproduce no matter how clever we become with our computer technology.  This is sometimes referred to as ""the ghost in the machine"" and can be found in respectable literature and film.

It is for the above reason that I find sci-fi movies that deal in a serious way with ""conscious"" computers or robot developments especially fascinating. I have also been waiting (with considerable disappointment) for the development of AI and a fully autonomous humanoid robot. Although IBM's chess master ""Big Blue"" and HONDA's humanoid bipedal robot, ASIMO, have been two noteworthy developments, I have been waiting for at least 50 years and still continue to wait.

While we may never be able to produce conscious computers, there is still hope for constructing a machine similar to 2001's HAL computer which Arthur Clarke projected to possess intelligence (AI) by that year. At least during his early years, Clarke believed there was no practical way to test for consciousness in AI machines beyond something called the ""Turing test"", discussed below. I have only recently learned that later in life he believed not only in AI, but that the future held the development of conscious computers. This despite the failure of his prediction of an AI computer like HAL by 2001.  He may have changed his opinion due to the current state of development of quantum computers which are projected to be capable of computation speeds approaching that estimated for the human brain by 25 to 50 years from now. I personally believe we will be able to produce convincing AI and the fully autonomous robot within 20 years from today with some clever programming work as well as the speeds permitted by silicon chips.

I have until now found compelling the well known argument that there is no way to test for machine intelligence, let alone consciousness, beyond the Turing test. The Turing test is a proposal for a test of a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence if not awareness. Described by Alan Turing in the 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"" it proceeds as follows: a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which try to appear human; if the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine is said to pass the test. In order to keep the test setting simple and universal the conversation is usually limited to a text-only channel such as a teletype machine (as Turing suggested).

This DVD discusses new developments that make me uncertain about the limitations of our test capabilities for machine awareness, and the theories covered in this DVD hold hope for understanding human, animal and even machine sentience, as well as new practical tests for awareness.

Be prepared for some pretty articulate speakers and some unconventional people as far as behavior, dress and just plain brilliance are concerned. A couple of these individuals appeared to hold some very strange ideas; however, most of them are scientists in the strictest sense and deserve your attention.",1206576000,7,5141,5.151079136690647
8065596,4,B0009RM9KI,"This DVD set contains roughly 6-7 hours of ""talking heads"" imparting a wide variety of views and information on the topic of consciousness. Since the talking heads belong to renown subject matter experts, a high level of discussion is maintained throughout all interviews. Some of the towering figures in the philosophy department, such as Dennett and Searle, are conspicuously absent and as a result the discussion appears to be somewhat neuroscience-oriented; at times it becomes slightly technical. Yet, it is still easy enough to be understood by laymen with limited knowledge of brain physiology such as myself. Because present day science doesn't have a working theory of consciousness, the topic is approached from many different angles. Some examples: Stuart Hameroff explains how conscious experience may arise from quantum coherence in microtubules. Steven Sevush presents the single neuron consciousness theory according to which consciousness is a fundamental property which even subatomic particles (or collections of them) might have. V. Ramachandran explores what synaesthesia and cognition might tell us about consciousness. Susan Blackmore articulates a ""mysterian"" perspective on consciousness. Dick Biermann investigates the deep questions of quantum mechanics and how these questions relate to consciousness. Andrew Newberg investigates meditation and spiritual experiences and talks about the ramifications for science. C. Seiter elucidates an experiment that seems to show that consciousness of two persons can get entangled. Parapsychologist Dean Radin talks about a remarkable experiment involving random number generators and apparent correlations between numerical patterns and the collective state of human consciousness. - These are just a few examples. - I gave it four stars instead of five for the absence of a wider presentation of philosophical ideas of consciousness.",1206403200,5,1901,5.866425992779783
8065597,4,B0009RM9KI,"Overall I enjoyed watching the DVD.  I ended up viewing it over the course of a week, watching one disc per night.  I found some of the topics much more interesting than others, but there is a good amount of variety amongst the thinkers in this film.

If you are looking for fancy animations or backgrounds you won't find them in this set.  The person simply sits in front of a blue background and speaks on their field.  I'm not quite sure if it's entirely worth the $40, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  It's incredibly interesting, but I think it should be more like $25 or $30.

If you have watched What the bleep or have read any other books on meditation, spirituality or the brain, this DVD set will provide a more in-depth look giving many different viewpoints & opinions.  If you're into this sort of thing, you should definitely get it.",1173657600,18,869,4.3875
