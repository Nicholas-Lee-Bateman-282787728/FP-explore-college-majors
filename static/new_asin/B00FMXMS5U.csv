6015339,5,B00FMXMS5U,"Martin Short is a TERRIFIC voice for this cartoon. My kids loooove learning about nature and science with these videos! It's educational and very humorous so even if mom & dad are in the room watching it's enjoyable (no offense Dora...okay a lot of offense, your voice is like nails on a chalkboard). This is an A+ purchase.",1395619200,3,324,4.603448275862069
6015340,5,B00FMXMS5U,"My son loves it!  He plays all three DVDs continuously.  I will definitely purchase more.  Not only does my son learn from these stories, they capture his full attention. Great buy!!!",1391990400,,183,4.838709677419355
6015341,5,B00FMXMS5U,"My 2 and 3 year old can't get enough of Cat in the Hat.  These DVD's have saved us on most drives.  Martin Short does a great job of playing Cat.  The DVD's are educational, funny and even appealing to the adults.  I can't recommend enough!",1386201600,,240,4.1521739130434785
6015342,5,B00FMXMS5U,Love how the DVD's autoplay for my son. The price is competitive. Wish their were less previews and commercials on a children's video.,1372723200,,134,4.869565217391305
6015343,5,B00FMXMS5U,"Got this for my 1 year old as he loves cat. This is excellent for weekends when pbs doesnt air cat. It's alot better than the movie I have, as there are many episodes as opposed to just 1 movie to watch millions of times.",1367280000,,221,3.933333333333333
6015344,5,B00FMXMS5U,I have a 3 and 6 year old who love to watch these DVDs.  They sing the songs and reenact the adventures in our backyard.  We love the Cat in the Hat!,1366243200,,149,3.625
6015345,5,B00FMXMS5U,"I buy every Cat in the Hat DVD that I can find for my son.  They are funny, yet teach at the same time.  A young child can relate to Nick and Sally and will love the Cat and Fish, Thing One and Thing Two as they go on an adventure!",1361577600,,231,3.5098039215686274
6015346,5,B00FMXMS5U,"Got these for my son because our PBS station started airing this show at 7:30 am and he's never up that early. Now he can watch Cat in the Hat any time he wants, which is almost all of the time!",1355788800,2,194,3.7560975609756095
6015347,5,B00FMXMS5U,Good value for the money.,1454371200,,25,4.2
6015348,5,B00FMXMS5U,Nothing  more  to  add at this  time.,1442275200,,37,3.857142857142857
6015349,4,B00FMXMS5U,"It's a different cat in the hat than the books which is nice, this one voices by Martin Short is whimsical and educational instead of a trouble maker.",1430611200,,150,4.392857142857143
6015350,5,B00FMXMS5U,"I bought this for my 3 month old grand daughter and she loves cat in the hat and laughs at the show so I bought others on amazon,  great item!",1430611200,,142,3.7333333333333334
6015351,5,B00FMXMS5U,"I bought this with Prime and ended up getting it just in time for Christmas.  It was priced at $8.49 which is an excellent price for 165 minutes plus ""bonus content"".  The box says ""Run time: Approx. 200 minutes"" which might be close.  So, you get a LOT of time in these shows for the money... if you can get it cheap.  The shows themselves are pretty entertaining for the kids.  I like all of The Cat in the Hat shows because they help to teach the children about different things that they normally wouldn't be exposed to such as ocean life.  They might be exposed to some of these things at an older age, but they don't see a lot of it right now.  So, the content in these particular shows is excellent.

I think the best part about this series is that instead of The Cat in the Hat coming to cause mischief with the kids, he's coming to teach them.  Plus, Martin Short is a great person to play the voice.  Although you can watch this series on the PBS Kids Video app... that only plays on one of our Kindles (mine) and I prefer to have it available on DVD so I can choose which one that they will be watching.  If you can get this at a decent price then it is completely worth having!",1428278400,5,1189,4.126086956521739

6015354,5,B00FMXMS5U,"My grandson and I have watched and re-watched this video many times.  So many times that as a 70 year old woman, I tend to drift off into a light sleep.  He nudges me and then I continue watching the DVD.  These beloved video/DVDs help Edwin immensely with the monumental task in front of him:  learning English.  Just day before yesterday his teacher told him, ""You are above everyone in this class!""  He listens to every word, and within a day he is using that word in his own sentence.  Fantastic aid for children who has an interest to learn!",1408579200,,546,4.4
