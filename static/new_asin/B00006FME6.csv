1752118,4,B00006FME6,"I did not read he novel, but this movie is a really well told story and good acting. It runs a little slow at times, but gives the feeling of reading a novel.",1388275200,2,158,3.8181818181818183
1752119,5,B00006FME6,I found this in amazon list and took a chance - fine acting; thoughtful evocative story. Deeply touching. Watch in a quiet moment.,1388188800,10,130,4.695652173913044
1752120,4,B00006FME6,"And if you read the novel, you know this a ""thinking"" piece that stimulates reflection, so if you aren't motivated by that description, you will find it extremely boring.  I didn't.  Jeremy Irons played his part perfectly.  The movie actually helped me understand the novel more.",1388102400,17,279,5.021739130434782
1752141,5,B00006FME6,Makes you ponder on life...and chances taken...and passed.  Wonderful.,1478217600,,70,6.777777777777778

1752143,5,B00006FME6,"This a movie that brings me to recall some of the films of the 1940s; wonderful cast, wonderful location (Lisbon), great direction, and the story is one that grabbed my full attention for the opening scenes.  Jeremy Irons was excellent as usual as was the rest of the cast.  I wanted this story to go on and on.  The ending is particularly wonderful.",1470355200,,350,4.523809523809524
1752144,5,B00006FME6,"Brilliant. Beautiful scenery, important historical context, excellent story, great acting, Very moving. Highly recommend.",1449273600,,121,7.714285714285714
1752145,5,B00006FME6,Great acting . True story events . All actors and actresses compliment and blend well with each other during the moving .,1446422400,,121,4.545454545454546
1752146,5,B00006FME6,This book has haunted me.  i adore it.  I even went to Lisbon to try to recapture the essence of the book.,1442361600,,106,3.772727272727273
1752147,4,B00006FME6,"As soon as I began watching the film on Netflix, I was happy and relieved to see how well-made it is.  The plot is not exactly plausible, but that didn't bother me.  Irons is great.  So is Charlotte Rampling.  But as flashbacks with lots of exposition turned into essentially a film within the film, I lost interest.  Still, I recommend the film.  For a funny, negative review, see Stephen Holden's in the NY Times.  The many location shots did make me want to visit Lisbon.  I can also recommend Wim Wenders' Lisbon Story.",1439078400,,523,4.548387096774194
1752148,5,B00006FME6,"... I was drawn to this movie because of the fantastic performance by Jack Huston in Boardwalk Empire.  Jeremy Irons plays the lead in this fabulous movie, but Jack Huston as Dr. Amadeus DuPrado is a runaway best performance",1436832000,,224,4.743589743589744
1752149,4,B00006FME6,Both my wife and I enjoyed this well-acted movie. The plot is somehow intriging too.,1429574400,,84,4.666666666666667
1752150,5,B00006FME6,"We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  We actually had seen it on the big screen before, and enjoyed it so much, that we wanted to share it with some friends who were visiting our home.  We knew almost nothing of this historical period in Portugal. The brutality of and lust for power never ceases to amaze and appal.

The performances were powerful; the story line was textured and moving.  And I always love experiencing the beauty of another place via the movies.",1428019200,,462,4.666666666666667
1752161,5,B00006FME6,"One word. Amazing!.. A of now, my favorite movie of all times!",1426636800,,62,4.25
1752162,5,B00006FME6,"I first read the book and loved it.  I also loved the movie.  I was afraid it would not get it right.  Of course, they had to minimize the story for a movie.  But it has the same sensitive, thoughtful, longing quality, longing to understand life and it's mystery, as the book.  I plan to buy both, to have them with me in my home.  Books and movies are like friends, if you love them.",1424736000,3,384,4.053333333333334
1752163,5,B00006FME6,GREAT MYSTERY/DRAM/SUSPENSE FILM....I LOVE IT!,1421884800,,46,8.4
1752164,4,B00006FME6,"Gentle, reflective & introspective.  Jeremy Irons +++  I find any thoughtful story in scenic Portugal satisfying.",1420329600,,113,6.0
1752165,5,B00006FME6,"Literate, beautifully paced, gorgeous cinematography in a glorious setting with Jeremy Irons ... what more could one ask?",1420156800,,121,5.777777777777778
1752166,3,B00006FME6,Not particularly impressed with this one.,1416355200,,41,6.0
1752167,5,B00006FME6,An interesting film about the revolution in the 70's that changed Portugal forever. Wonderful cast and an unusual love story.,1413331200,,125,5.3
1752168,4,B00006FME6,"I first saw this film on a flight and more recently on HBO, and my first reaction was that it was a lovely little gem of a film, one that got little publicity, probably made no money, but how can you go wrong with a cast that includes Jeremy Irons, Lena Olin, Tom Courtenay and other terrific actors (and the young ones were also impressive)?  Curious about how the film was received generally, I was surprised to find reviews almost uniformly negative - on all fronts.  And true, there are some absurdities - mainly, why would all these people open themselves up to a Swiss schoolteacher who happens to want to get the story?  Who is he to them?  That said, it's a quiet and thought-provoking experience; something requires you to pay attention and immerse yourself.  And while the historical accuracy is open to question, it's not an entirely implausible scenario.  So give it a shot.",1411171200,,886,4.647435897435898
1752169,5,B00006FME6,Good movie! and a Amazon is the best!.....,1410652800,,42,4.375
1752170,3,B00006FME6,I thought plot was interesting and had some suprises.  Good actors and acting but first third to half of movie was somewhat slow moving.  My wife stopped watching the moving about of third of the way through.,1410480000,2,208,4.594594594594595
1752171,4,B00006FME6,"We were very pleasantly surprised!  Loved the book, very much enjoyed the film.",1406764800,2,79,5.076923076923077
1752172,5,B00006FME6,Supper movie,1405728000,,12,5.5
1752173,4,B00006FME6,I watched the film primarily because I am an avid Jack Huston and Jeremy Irons fan.  Both actors are dynamic and give so much to the movie going public. My hope is that Jack Huston will be offered dramatic roles in the near future that will truly show us the range he can give to make his characters multi-faceted and legendary. A wonderful film for those of us who think about our time in life.,1402704000,3,395,4.266666666666667
1752174,2,B00006FME6,"I had high expectation from the beginning. Gave it a chance, but the script went nowhere.  Watch Iron's other flicks.",1402704000,,117,4.85
1752175,4,B00006FME6,Elements of romance and mystery combine to pull the spectator into this movie.  An excellent movie for the sleuth who enjoys putting pieces together to solve a puzzle.,1402099200,2,167,4.964285714285714
1752176,4,B00006FME6,"Sensitive treatment about a past time I was unfamiliar with....acting at its best and a worthwhile film to see
..when this kind of talent lays it down, its a beauty to watch ,,see this one",1398556800,2,188,4.4
1752177,3,B00006FME6,"I wanted to love this film.  It has great cinematography, writing and acting.  However, I just didn't.  Slow and at times, painfully so.  I think it could have been shorter and made the point.  But it did make me want to read the book, which I'm looking forward to.  Irons never disappoints.",1398297600,,291,4.5
1752178,1,B00006FME6,I love Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Ramplingthis movie tries to be interestingbut never succeeds.my husband refused to keep watching.had to see the end myself following daysad to see such actors and such effort putting together a movie and then to fail so..,1397606400,,255,5.095238095238095
1752179,5,B00006FME6,"As always,  another great movie with Jeremy Irons. A must watch... Between the intrigue, loneliness, love and drama, there is always hope.",1397260800,,138,5.2727272727272725
1752180,5,B00006FME6,"Why can't Hollywood produce more movies like this? For those of you who's gag reflex can't take one more ""IronMan 23"" or whatever the heck number it is, then this movies a great diversion. Irons has always been a fine actor but it seems like he's so seasoned now that he can't do any wrong. He really makes you embrace the character instantly, in 5 minutes you care about what happens to him. This search for meaning in his life that brings him to engross himself in a mysterious history of another person becomes very personal to you as the viewer from the outset. I love it when an actor can do that, draw me in like that. I really enjoyed it. Reminded me a lot of ""The Words"" (another great Iron's role). This is one you'll want to buy, not rent.",1395187200,12,749,4.28169014084507
1752201,5,B00006FME6,"Beautifully acted, written, and directed, here we are given view to not one, but two stories, both of them worth telling.  Our story teller shows the longing of a quiet solitary life, the triumph and tragedy of a passionate life, and through their intersection, the redemption of both.",1394409600,6,285,4.9375
1752202,4,B00006FME6,Quiet movie that has a satisfying ending.  It feels like it was made from a book which it was.  Nice.,1394409600,,101,4.0
1752203,5,B00006FME6,"This film is well worthy of a watching -- Jeremy Irons' investigation of the mystery of a man's life and love constitutes a very engaging, entertaining, and lyrical piece of work.  Highly recommended!",1394150400,,200,5.0606060606060606
1752204,5,B00006FME6,"Bruno Ganz, Charlotte Rampling, Lina Olin and others made this film worth watching. Usually I need to see any film several times before writing a review.

And even on first viewing I felt the flaws in the narrative --too confusing especially about the revolutionary past and the deep friendships among three men--and yet for me the acting was so amazing that what I did not understand I figured I will on second viewing.  I loved this film. Recommend for those who  love foreign films and recommended for the hidden and the overt story and mainly  for the amazing cast.",1393977600,4,569,4.717171717171717
1752205,5,B00006FME6,"This is a lovely story that is well written, well acted, and beautifully shot.
And of course, Jeremy Irons, as always, is elegant.",1393718400,,130,4.695652173913044
1752206,4,B00006FME6,"Well performed movie.  Nice and somewhat special story.
For families and others looking for European culture, unexpected positive human behavior and well done acting.",1392854400,,166,5.916666666666667
1752207,4,B00006FME6,Really a superb movies with lots of twists and turns.  Jeremy Irons is top drawer in this one.  The cast and setting in Lisbon is awesome.  The ending is a surprise until the end.  Watch it!,1392508800,,190,4.194444444444445
1752208,4,B00006FME6,"Did not know much about this ""revolt"" and found the information interesting.  Jeremy Irons (as usual) is lovely.  The story was interesting but a bit slow.  It was interesting",1392422400,2,175,4.9655172413793105
1752209,4,B00006FME6,Good plot and development. Always wondering what was next. A reminder of things that are unpleasant in our histories we tend to cover up,1392336000,,136,4.708333333333333
1752210,5,B00006FME6,Wonderful story based on accurate information and movie better than the book. Pulls all the strings from the head to the heart.,1392336000,6,127,4.818181818181818
1752221,5,B00006FME6,"Contrary to many ""hollywood"" films today- this is a film about a good story-excellent acting across the film-good photography- and intelligent character roles. all well done",1392249600,6,173,5.6923076923076925
1752222,4,B00006FME6,"""night train"" seems to begin as a bit of escapist fluff with some lovely shots of lisbon; but the story deepens with gentle sincerity and approaches insights on life that older viewers will fully appreciate.

irons is a mature and dreary lyc&eacute;e professor in dreary berne who deters a woman from suicide and then impulsively uses the train ticket he finds in her abandoned coat to track down the author of a book of meditations he also finds in the coat pocket. (quite an impactful coat, so of course it's red.) in lisbon his search leads him to antiquated portuguese resistance fighters who retell in the amber light of declining life their gallant and love tossed lives as young people fighting fascism. this motivates a sextet of cameos by notable 20th century british and german movie stars, all perfect in their roles. their reminiscences are portrayed in flashback by a fine group of young actors.

these stories and the literary musings of the philosopher's book fire the professor's imagination and appetite for life; he gets new glasses and new clothes, he drinks, he smokes, he sleuths and vagabonds freely, and pretty soon a passably attractive optometrist in a mercedes SUV (quite a snappy SUV, so of course it's red), is pitching him woo, lisbon style. (""why go back to berne? why not stay here!"")

i won't apologize for spoilers because everything unfolds as if you have already heard it all; and besides, all the plot twists are in the flashbacks, which reveal the choices and suffering that have made the old people what they are. the beauty of this fantasy is that it shows how one's life is both inevitable and accidental, when viewed in retrospect, which is something old age understands with clarity. the film manages to recreate this delicate contemplative recognition without ever becoming maudlin or trite. completely charming and well done.",1391472000,6,1869,4.945859872611465
1752223,5,B00006FME6,"Night Train to Lisbon is a haunting tale of a contrasting ""boring"" life story of man who by chance crosses paths with the past and three ""vital"" lives.  It's a riveting story of love and rebellion again dictatorship.  The story has a wonderful rhythm that captivate the attention and interest of the viewer.  Of course, it's again Jeremy Irons that recreates the main character's inner self with power and originality.

1752224,5,B00006FME6,"This film is superlative in almost every way. The cinematography is artful but remains the context for the story, not the focus of it. Jeremy Irons is in top form as are the other actors. This is a film where if you miss a line or two, you can be sunk. Every phrase seems poignant and connected to everything else in the network of characters. And, one other feature I always examine closely in a film is the quality of the music. The composer, Annette Focks has scored this beautifully with the right combination of sweetness and melancholy.

My only negative comment is about the streaming itself. I've thoroughly checked my internet connectivity and it iss above national averages by a long shot, but this film, as with many from Amazon, halted about 20 times making a 1:51 film take almost a full hour more to finish it. I even tried re-starting two times to try and get the download from Amazon faster. Very troubling.",1390608000,2,923,4.593939393939394
1752225,4,B00006FME6,"The acting is very good, story is a bit confusing (especially keeping the characters in their older and younger versions straight).  Beautiful views of Lisbon.",1390435200,2,159,5.36
1752226,1,B00006FME6,Not a good story nor a compelling plot - - don't get your hopes up. This adaptation is a total mess,1389657600,,99,3.761904761904762
1752227,5,B00006FME6,"This movie is everything you could want in a story of love, hope, intrigue and friendship. A love story within a love story within a time of war, resistance and death.... Very powerful. I expect nothing less of Jeremy Irons and Mr. Ganz (who I dearly love as a actor)... The support cast was tremendous... the scenery compelling and the story timeless in man's struggle for love, life and freedom from tyranny.... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie...",1389571200,,457,4.725
1752228,4,B00006FME6,I really liked this movie. Its well written and makes you think about the events. Its more cerebral and not a lot of action. It makes you think and leaves a lot of factors up to your imagination. I watched it with my wife and we had a nice conversation about it afterwords.,1389225600,,273,4.169811320754717
1752229,5,B00006FME6,Thought provoking. Two equally interesting plots simultaneously unfolding. Not the simplistic blockbuster - everything is resolved- ending. Perfectly casted. Interesting little-known historical period in Portugal.,1388966400,6,213,7.56

7968082,1,B00006FME6,"Stunk. with or without ice. This was extremely disappointing movie. I did not read the book - maybe its better. but watched the trailer, I enjoy movies with a little history mixed in, but this was pretty bad story writing.",1499644800,,222,4.575
