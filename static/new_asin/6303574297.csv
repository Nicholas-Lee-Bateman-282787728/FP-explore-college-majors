8163825,5,6303574297,"Journey's End is a retrospective look back at the seven eventful seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation and a preview of the two-hour series finale, and it originally aired immediately ahead of the finale All Good Things.  You get a little summation of each character as he/she has evolved over the years, with a lot of emphasis on the first season, and the leading actors all have a moment to comment on their experiences over the years.  The character of Dr. Pulaski, who replaced Beverly Crusher as ship's medical officer for at least one season, is completely ignored, which sort of rubs me the wrong way (not that I actually liked her character, but she deserved at least a mention) - especially since I had to look at several old clips featuring Wesley Crusher (thankfully, though, there was no interview with Will Wheaton).
The special was hosted by Jonathon Frakes, and he takes you through a little mini-tour of some of the sets, answers a few questions people have often asked about the ship, and shows you how a few different special effects are brought to life.  The real stars of the special are the crucial men and women behind the cameras, as they get their moment in the sun to show and tell you a little bit about their jobs.  You also get a look at one of the largest Star Trek conventions of 1994 when Jonathon Frakes makes a surprise appearance among the throng of ardent Trekkies.
There are a lot of references to and previews of the final episode, which in itself brings everything around full circle with its revisit of the events from the premiere episode of the series.  Frakes also talks about the movie then in production which incorporated Captain Kirk, Scotty, and Chekhov into the world of ST:TNG, the series Deep Space Nine, and the upcoming Voyager series.
It's basically an informal tribute to the success of ST:TNG, and it was probably meant as a comfort of sorts to the legions of fans having to cope with the end of a beloved show.  If so, it performed both jobs quite well indeed.",1089936000,4,2020,4.612813370473537
8163826,5,6303574297,"After watching all seven seasons on DVD I felt it only appropriate to pull this one out of the VHS cabinet and watch it again.  Of course, since picking up a DVD player in late 98, the VHS cabinet took some getting into due to rust and cobwebs, but obviously the mission was successful.
I haven't watched this since I purchased it right when it came out at the end of the show.  At that time, this was all some great and fresh video about The Next Generation's cast and crew.  After watching all of the Special Features areas of all seven seasons, one quickly realizes that a majority of what is seen here was put on the boxed DVD sets.  That is perfectly fine though considering that are some things on here that weren't added to those sets.
Star Trek in so many ways represents what is good about humanity and its future that it is almost compelling to watch and Star Trek The Next Generation not only picked that up but took it ""where no other series had gone before.""  In ""Journey's End"" you will find it to be a short but fitting tribute to the great many things that took place on and off screen during the seven year run of this outstanding series.  You will also see a little bit about Deep Space Nine which was finishing its second year when this tribute was made.  Host Jonathan Frakes does an outstanding job as well!
I would highly recommend this VHS, if you can find it!  {ssintrepid}",1050883200,9,1397,4.346153846153846
