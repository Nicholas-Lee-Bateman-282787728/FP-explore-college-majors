5087121,1,B007HPNIL4,Picture not good and missing sound at certain times.  I felt like I was watching a poor bootleg.  Not quite sure how CBS puts something out with this poor quality.,1357257600,,163,4.4
5087122,5,B007HPNIL4,"The contestants in this season were definately different and colorful and made for an exceptionally fun and exciting season!  Keep offering in DVD for sale, I love it!",1356825600,,167,4.964285714285714
5087123,3,B007HPNIL4,"I've always remembered Johnatan & Victoria as the loud couple, they always had to do something to get attention and boy did they had it. The dvd in general was a bit scrathed and it skipped some parts, it is not as good quality as the ones from seasons 1 & 7.

5087124,4,B007HPNIL4,Enjoyable and nostalgic to see one of the best seasons. The earlier seasons had more colorful characters. Quality of DVD was good,1341792000,,129,4.909090909090909
5087125,5,B007HPNIL4,"I have now seen almost every season of the Amazing Race. I love sharing them with the kids - to encourage them to embrace new adventures and challenges and to show them how amazing travel can be. Excellent customer service from Amazon on this one, who quickly settled a delivery issue.",1341532800,,285,4.607843137254902
5087126,5,B007HPNIL4,"I've seen every episode of this series and think this is one of the rare reality shows with true value.

The thing I love most about the show are the locations.  It is the next best thing to traveling the world myself.  Not only do I get to see multiple and varied locales, including many that I will likely never get to travel to myself, but the show producers also do a great job of finding the most unique adventures to complete in each area.  I've learned more about world geography and different cultures than I ever learned in any classroom.

It's also interesting to watch the interpersonal dynamics between teammates and between teams.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to finding the conflicts entertaining . . . and the stress of travel and competition does bring it out.  But I always root for the teams that are nicest to each other.

And it's rewarding to see how the intensity of the race truly brings teammates closer together by forcing them to work together and rely on one another.",1340755200,,997,4.5
5087127,1,B007HPNIL4,I order this dvd more than 2 month ago still not here I don't know if I have to just wait or what?,1340668800,,98,3.3043478260869565
5087128,4,B007HPNIL4,"I decided to buy this season since I love The Amazing Race and wanted to watch a season I had never seen. The product is made on-demand which explains why when it came the cover was inserted the wrong way and there were no bonus features. But all in all,it ran fine in my DVD player. Having never seen this season,I did not know what to expect. There were a lot of couples,dating or married,which adds up to a lot of fighting and good drama for the show. Be forewarned that you will hate Jonathan. The guy is verbally and at times physically abusive to his wife. It's hard to watch that. Also,another contestant that I did not like was Kendra. Look up the word snob in a dictionary and her name is under it. Your jaw will drop when you hear some of the things she says about the places they are visiting. It's an embarrassment. Other wise I enjoyed this season. I couldn't stop watching and I'd recommend it to anyone.",1338940800,,918,4.312138728323699
5087129,5,B007HPNIL4,"That would make an average of 4.5, but since I can't give that rating, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a full 5.

This is one of my favorite seasons of Amazing Race, and I was stoked when I found out it was getting a DVD release. Overall this may be one of the most fun casts that the show has ever had (even if it does have terrible Jonathan). It also features some of my favorite challenges and one of the most fun race routes.

The set itself is a little disappointing for what it's worth. I'm glad that it comes in a regular-sized case to save shelf-space, but I'm a little disappointed that quality was sacrificed for having the season spread over a smaller number of discs. It's 13 episodes, 11 of which are 42 minutes and first and last episodes being 80 minutes each, on a mere three discs. Personally I would have been happier with four discs, with the extra space used to increase quality. The Survivor seasons are spread over five discs and have higher quality video/audio. I can't complain too much though, since just two years ago the possibility of this season getting any sort of home media release was practically nonexistent, so I'm thankful that it actually even got released.

The chances of this season ever getting a mass-retail release are practically zero, so if you're a fan of the season, this is your best bet. The prices on these sets fluctuate all the time, so wait for a price on this that catches your eye and jump at the chance. If you are an Amazing Race fan and you missed this season, I would highly recommend it. If you love the season like me, this is a must buy.",1336521600,,1619,4.336633663366337
5087130,5,B007HPNIL4,"For the first few episodes, I really didn't like TAR6 at all. It was by far my least favourite at the time and all the bickering couples (particularly from Jonathan) mixed with all the non-couples being elminated pretty quickly really wasn't doing it for me. However, around episode 4/5 I learnt to get over that and once you stop taking the season too seriously you really learn to enjoy it. As a matter of fact, most of the bickering had me in stitches towards the end and I ended up warming to a lot more of the endgame couples than I thought I would. So overall, it ended up leveling out for me as a top tier season and one I wouldn't pass up watching again. So glad to finally be having the first 7 seasons on DVD. Keep them coming!",1332201600,8,737,4.23404255319149
8516812,4,B007HPNIL4,"Other than NOT being in widescreen, I love the show and liked the DVDs.",1493596800,,71,4.142857142857143
8516813,4,B007HPNIL4,"My wife and I really enjoy the amazing race so this summer we decided that instead of waiting for the fall installment we'd get old ones and watch them over the summer. We started with early one's that I'd never seen (I began watching before she did and then got her hooked). This is the first season we ordered that I'd already seen but she hadn't.

I remember this season even after six years, it's pretty much the season that got me hooked on the show even though I was really disappointed with who won, a more inane, shallow and ignorant team has never appeared on AR before or since, well , maybe this past spring season but it's close. Ironically Kendra and her bf and the team I'm speaking of from the most recent season are all models...just a coincidence I'm sure.

Anyway, we're halfway through this season, we have to force ourselves to watch just one (ok, maybe two) episodes a week, and I thought because I know who wins it would kind of kill the thrill for me but it really hasn't. This is just an entertaining season with Rebecca and her ex boyfriend who we call horn boy (if you've watched this season you'll know why) constantly at each others throats and Rebecca proving over and over that she's one of the funniest and most fun contestants ever who gets the award for one of the best comebacks in the history of AR when confronted by Kendra about the time out; Kendra; ""why did you do that to us, why?"" Rebecca; ""so many questions..."", love it.  And speaking of Kendra; her utterance of increasingly more stupid, racist, offensive and inane comments every week, and let's also not forget the used car salesman type from LA who thinks he's the smartest man not only in the race but on the planet and isn't even close, and on and on. It's a great show and I think this was one of the best seasons....despite who won the million dollars in the end.",1470873600,,1864,4.412790697674419

1 and 7 were just fine, but Season 6 is blankCD's  will not place",1440806400,,92,3.6
8516817,5,B007HPNIL4,"This is such a good season. I'll skip over what the show is about. If you've seen any of the seasons, then you know what this is about.  It had a lot of interesting  couples and nice challenges.

I really disliked Jonathan. He was abusive- emotional, verbally, and physical against Victoria. He's the only low point in the season.

If you have someone in your life that loved The Amazing Race, then this is a must have for them.",1419033600,,428,4.379746835443038
8516818,3,B007HPNIL4,"Of the first six seasons this is the first one I found painful to watch all the way.  The reason was the abusive men and in particular Jonathan.  The yelling, lack of respect, and verbal abuse is bad but when Jonathan knocks Victoria down he should have been removed from the show.  There of course will be fights and disagreements in a race like this but some of these couples clearly don't respect each other or love each other.  It's not funny or entertaining.  The DVDs are spotty in quality.  There are bad spots on a couple DVDs, you wait until your DVD player gives up trying to play those spots or you fast forward through them but overall you can watch all the episodes.  It is silly that somebody can't buy good quality blanks and take the time to duplicate high quality DVDs for the price they sell these at.",1411171200,,819,4.3841059602649

8516820,5,B007HPNIL4,"I love this season, I can laugh so much on Jonathan and Victoria, and last but not least there are two episode filmed in Hungary, which is so much fun to me (as a Hungarian) to watch.",1385424000,,183,3.972972972972973
8516821,3,B007HPNIL4,"INSPECT THE DISCS ONCE YOU GET THEM!!! I'm basically agreeing with D. Hutton's review.  The season itself is great!  However, the discs skip a lot and the third disc has a huge gash in it and doesn't play the last 2 episodes at all.  Unfortunately, I didn't watch it during the first month I got it so now it can't be returned.  Everyone out there, learn from my mistake.",1357344000,,371,4.333333333333333
