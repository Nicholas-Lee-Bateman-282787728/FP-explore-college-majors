8237299,5,B00106VAPM,I have gone back and watched this film maybe 3 times over the past 2 years and I find it to be a very relevant film that addresses our situation today. It does a better job critiquing consumerist society and it's consequences than other films of longer length. I found the video content and editing to be interesting and well done in my opinion. The repetition of dialog in the film is appropriate but might make your housemates wonder what the hell your watching if they are not in the same room with you.,1334361600,,506,4.3936170212765955
8237300,2,B00106VAPM,"The most irritating and repetitive film I've ever seen. This is a glorified music video.
I dislike consumer culture we have but this documentary offers very little insight and virtually no solutions.
I'm convinced the creators of this film just interviewed Zerzan and then tried to make a movie out of a few snippets.

This is how the movie moves along. Someone will speak for 2 minutes criticizing consumerism in some way, THEN we are treated to 10 minutes of a beat with some phrases repeated over AND OVER AND OVER.
Maybe once or twice it's okay but it's basically the entire movie. The breaking point for me was about 17 minutes in a man is shown standing in a factory with his finger on a button as you hear Zerzan speak.
Once Zerzan says the word ""variety"" the man pushes the button and they repeat the ""variety"" soundbite. Then they repeat that literally seven times. Then right after the repeat the next thing he says twice. Then they ANNOY me ever more by repeating the phrase ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT ONE PERCENT
Theres so much repetition it made me just say f this pretentious crap.

You can tell the editors of the film thought they were so brilliant, innovative, & deep, when really it's just annoying.
They show some interesting stuff but don't comment on it. For instance there is this very disturbing clip of a man who makes sex dolls. It's a bit unsettling and yeah i can draw my own conclusions but i want to hear what they have to say about it. They just show you stuff like Steve Balmer acting like an ahole then they edit it and repeat something he said OVER AND OVER. Rice, beans, RICE & BEANS!
