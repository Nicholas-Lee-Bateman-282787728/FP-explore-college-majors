Jesse McCartney and Zac Efron I think are the hottest guys on this planet and I will be sooo sad if it doesn't come on DVD.

Summerland by far is and forever will be my favorite tv show. Not only does this show star amazing actors and actress such as Shawn Chrsitian, Lori L., Zac Efron, Kay P. & more but it's it also has a great plot to it. a must watch tv show for anyone!

1541590,5,B00005JO3Y,"One of the biggest reasons i love this show is because of Zac Efron,19 he is the hotest guy I have ever layed my eyes on. I also think his relationship with Kay Panabaker,14 in the show is so cute they look great together even though he is 4 years older than her she cant even drive and shes almost done with college isn't that so cool. Zac Efron I love you.

1541591,5,B00005JO3Y,"I really hope it comes on DVD so if it never is on TV again we can watch it when ever we want to and maybe if enought DVD's sell they will bring it out on TV more and make more DVD's. This was kind of the same deal when Full House came out and it wasn't for sure then a few months later I got a email from amazon saying  Full house was available to buy and thats what I'm hoping will happen with Summer Land!

1541952,5,B00005JO3Y,"I really really hope that this show comes out on DVD.  It is both bad and sad enough that they took it off the air, but to possibly not even allow us to buy it on DVD is horrible.  I miss this show so much and I want to be able to see more of it.  PLEASE bring the DVD to it's loyal viewers!!",1133049600,6,292,3.53125
1541953,5,B00005JO3Y,"I can't believe it's been taken off the air. We are stationed overseas and the show comes on satelite here in England. The show is on rather late and I've been staying up way past my bodies abilitly and went to look for it at the local shop on base and found there was no boxed set. To my amaizment I log on here and find out that it has been canceled in the states and I am completely ticked off. This show is the best I've ever seen. I don't usually watch these types of dramas but I'm hooked on this one and now it appears I won't be seeing any more.

Completely and udderly PO'D,

1541954,5,B00005JO3Y,i think it is stupid how they took the show off the air...i don't understand why they did it...a lot of people were in to that show and it should not have been cancelled...if anyone can tell me why it was cancelled then be my guest.....you don't just put a show on the air for almost a year and take it off,1127779200,4,306,3.9516129032258065
1541955,5,B00005JO3Y,"This is crazy. First you cancel the show, and then you say it might not even come out on DVD? I am completely *obsessed* with this show. And with Jesse McCartney becoming a teenage sex symbol, I think hundreds of millions of people--especially teenagers--would buy this DVD. Parents love this show too, and I think you would have millions and millions of people extremely pissed if you didn't come out with this on DVD.",1123545600,9,419,4.675675675675675
1541956,5,B00005JO3Y,"I have been watching the show since it started last summer, and i absolutly LOVE the show! now that the show is coming to an end and they are taking it off air, the only time i will be able to watch it is if they put the show on dvd!! The fact that they are taking it off air was a shock to most fans, i mean the show had high rating and dedicated fans! why WB would want to take it off in the first place is beyond me! all my friends watch the show and love it! the actors and actress are all wounderful and the concept to the show is great! i mean, come on if One Tree Hill, and Smallville could last why not Summerland? One Tree Hill is almost exactly like The O.C, now don't get me wrong i love both of those shows, but summerland brought somthing different to watch the concept was different from most shows! and the show sky rocketed when it aired! so now since they have decided to take it off air, all fans of the show have left are the hopes that they put both seasons on DVD! soo PLEASE put it on DVD!!!",1121644800,8,1013,3.9223300970873787
