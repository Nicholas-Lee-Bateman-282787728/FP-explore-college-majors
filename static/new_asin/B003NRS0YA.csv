8717731,5,B003NRS0YA,"This step show was actually pretty good.  It featured two shows at this one event and SEVERAL step teams that are not pictured.  I enjoyed the old-school alumni show more than expected.  The collegiate show was cool also.

Also check out their Florida A&M (FAMU) Homecoming step show.",1274659200,,284,4.854166666666667
