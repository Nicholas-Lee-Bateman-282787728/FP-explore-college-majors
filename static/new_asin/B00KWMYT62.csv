6452531,5,B00KWMYT62,I had previously purchased the Rurouni Kenshin trilogy so when I bought Gatchaman I knew I was getting an awesome movie and it did not let me down. Package arrived between the dates that was in my confirmation email. I am very pleased with the movie and with Amazon!!!!,1441929600,2,269,4.510204081632653
6452532,2,B00KWMYT62,"I'm a huge fan of the original Gatchaman anime and was very excited to see this live-action adaptation. Sadly, I was very disappointed. As I was watching, I felt as if the director, producer, and writers, have never seen a single episode of Gatchaman. The characters are not true to the original, especially the story's nemesis, Berg Katse, who was a complete disaster in character translation. The actors and actresses they chose to play the parts are hokey and lack any kind of charisma. The whole movie plays off as if you're watching Power Rangers or Mortal Combat. If you've never seen any of the original Gatchaman anime (or Battle of the Planets) then you might like this movie. Otherwise, someone seriously needs to remake this to a more accurate account of the original anime.",1437436800,3,785,4.822222222222222
6452533,5,B00KWMYT62,"I've been waiting for a bluray of this since I saw the trailer.  The picture quality is awesome, the DTS Sound ...... Whew. You want a review of the movie?  Read the other reviews. ",1432252800,,181,4.264705882352941
6452534,5,B00KWMYT62,"Oh Hell YES! if you seeing this them you where probably a fan of Gatchaman (i.e., Battle of the Planets) the anime of the 1970s.
Now, 40 years later, this franchise is getting a new anime and a live-action filmwhich debuted in Japan 2 yrs ago. Sadly, this attempt to reinvent Gatchaman has created nothing but a painfully clichd action movie BUT with watching.
Easily the most entertaining bit of the movie is its first fight. It is excellently choreographed and does a good job of showing how people with super speed and super strength would fight hand-to-hand. Also, the way they flywhich is half-flight, half-jumping off buildings to suddenly change directionis a ton of fun to watch.
When you know that they spent $40,000 per costume (for a total of $200,000), and then you see the film, you can't help but feel that maybe some of that money should have gone to the special effects instead. Every action scene of the movie is a mix of models, plastic sets, full CG, and CG characters pasted over videos of the real worldand you will have no problem telling which is which at any given time.
All in all. Its Cheesy action hero fun, plain and simple.",1430092800,,1152,4.597087378640777
6452535,5,B00KWMYT62,"I didn't know there was a live action version was done until I seen it on YouTube. ... Great story line & superb graphics, especially in blu ray....its worth buying",1417564800,3,164,4.5
6452536,5,B00KWMYT62,"Loved it, brought back Battle of The Planets/G-Force for me in live-action, cant ask for more!

Well maybe a dubbed version included, I like subs but I know for a fact some people I know would be put off just for it being subtitled and they'd be missing out sadly. great enjoyable film, 5 stars.",1410307200,2,295,4.363636363636363

8662210,2,B00KWMYT62,"First of all, I'm 41 and grew up on the inferior version of the cartoon called Battle of the Planets. I was attracted to the franchise after Alex Ross redesigned the cover art of the DVD/Blu-ray set. I then heard about this live action film and purchased it blindly and immediately. The beginning is really cool and starts off action-pacted. But, after that it gets excruciatingly boring afterwards. A LOT of dialogue, exposition, and overused flashback sequences. I was hoping that the ending would make up for the large boring middle section, but it didn't. I don't hate it, but was really disappointed in the slow pacing.",1473206400,,624,4.841121495327103
8662211,4,B00KWMYT62,"There are at least two versions of this movie that have wildly different subtitles and that change the story in significant ways.  I wish the costumes had been made closer to the original design rather than this darked-up ""modern"" look.  The helmets are way too similar and Ryu is WAY too skinny, Jinpei is WAY too old/big, and if they think Jun looks like a swan they missed that by a mile.  All that said, it's fairly entertaining even with the sub-par visual effects.",1472601600,,470,4.571428571428571
8662212,3,B00KWMYT62,"If you are a fan of Gatchaman, youll be a bit dissapointed.  The movie itself feels more like a big budgeted Power Rangers knockoff.  The storyline has nothing to do with the original show.
My biggest complain was that the God Phoenix was used for like only 5 minutes.  The coolest part of the show was reduced to a glorified cameo on the movie.
I really wanted to love this movie, but if you are a fan of the original series, you will be disappointed.",1466640000,,452,4.294117647058823
