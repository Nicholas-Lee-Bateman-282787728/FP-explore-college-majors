3853885,2,B0026IQTPY,This has entirely too much unnecessary cursing in it.  The storyline was sometimes hard to follow.,1277078400,3,98,5.125
3853886,4,B0026IQTPY,"This movie made you think.  But the beginning of it was very, very, very, slow.  They took you all around the block just to give Miss E character.  But once you get past that the movie keeps you on your toes.  Especially with a shocker that did not gross you out.  But made you understand sleeping around so much and lies may cause you to sleep with a little bit of yourself.  Very interesting movie.  The little boy was such a great actor even the audience clapped for him.  The Doggish agent was saying baby tooo much especially when he did not have that Louisiana twang.
The movie is a must see.  BUY IT!",1275523200,2,607,4.254385964912281

8352709,5,B0026IQTPY,"First I must say I absolutely love Vanessa Bell Calloway. She is so beautiful and talented to me and there is not a role that she's played that I didn't love. This story line was so relatable to me, because I believe that no one should ever give up on their dreams and passion. If the people around you don't support you, they are people you sometiimes have to let go. The drama and twist were great and it all made sense. I laughed, cried a little because I myself have one daughter and as a mother I know how hard it is to have a bond with your child. I just enjoyed this production and again I applaud Vanessa Bell Calloway. I love her and I think she is a beautiful sister! Great job!",1494115200,,688,4.103703703703704

8352714,5,B0026IQTPY,I purchased this DVD a while back and enjoyed it very much. I watched it again on BET last Sunday and enjoyed it even more. The story was well developed. It started slowly and then built up to a suspenseful climax. The characters were well developed. A play truly worth watching,1292803200,,278,4.470588235294118
8352715,5,B0026IQTPY,"I enjoyed this very much.  I initially purchased it because Mrs Vernee Watson was staying at my Resort and I wanted to tell her about something recent I had seen that she was in.  The ending was extremely shocking and I did not expect for it to turn out the way it did.  By the way, Mrs. Vernee Watson is the nicest person you would ever meet.",1283212800,,343,4.08955223880597
