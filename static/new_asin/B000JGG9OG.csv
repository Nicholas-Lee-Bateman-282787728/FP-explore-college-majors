8208367,5,B000JGG9OG,"This is an excellent way to get some beautiful and classic jazz standards under your belt. There's no notation at all, just Corey Christiansen talking you through the changes and melody, including some common variations/substitutions. Not for a rank beginner - this DVD assumes you know basic chord voicings and the notes on the neck. There's not much emphasis on soloing, this is more about learning the harmonic underpinnings of the tunes. He definitely moves along at a pretty fast clip. It's aimed at the intermediate player who's just getting into jazz. I got this as a gift for a friend I'm giving informal lessons to, and he loves it. Highly recommended.",1270944000,2,661,4.910714285714286
