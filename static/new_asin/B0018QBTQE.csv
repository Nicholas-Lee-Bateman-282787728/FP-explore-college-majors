8270646,5,B0018QBTQE,"I've followed Bart Sher's career for years. He is one of America's best, both in theater and opera.  His interview with Charlie Rose should be required viewing for all young artists today.

VIVA Bart and let's hope he continues to revist, reinvent, refresh, renew more of the great theater, musical and operatic traditions of America.

8270647,5,B0018QBTQE,Love hearing Bart Sher's analysis and points on his amazing 2008 Broadway Revival of South Pacific. This man is a brilliant director. Listening to his thoughts on stage directing and stage craft is fascinating. Fascinating to hear what a true artist has to say about the artistic process.,1215043200,3,288,5.020833333333333
8270648,4,B0018QBTQE,"Miliband is the British Foreign Secretary. He is the second youngest in British History. He reveals a strong U.S. connection having lived here as a child and studied here. He is confident and articulate. He expresses throughout the interview a great friendliness to the United States. He refuses to accept the proposition that the twenty- first century is not the American one. He points out that the U.S. is still the world's predominant power. Miliband is a diplomat not only in name, but in his presentation of things. He does not directly criticize anyone or anything. When Charlie Rose rightfully presses him on Iran's nuclear violations and the fact that Diplomacy has not worked to this time. Miliband makes the somewhat astounding statement that it has only been 'four years' of trying. Miliband however is good in pointing out the absurdity of Iran claiming its program is for peaceful purposes when it has no civilian nuclear facilities. Miliband prefers the diplomatic solution with Iran and in fact elsewhere. When asked about his party's loss of the recent elections he points to the three- fold crunch that the world and Great Britain are now facing. Tough credit markets, high - price of fuel, high food prices. He suggests that the test of a government is what it does in tough times, and that his government is now taking the decisions which will prove to be correct in the future.
Considering that he is speaking on American television Miliband does an excellent job in reassuring the  people of the United States that Great Britain is still with it, an ally who shares its values, and believes in its special superpower status.",1211328000,,1646,4.899641577060932
