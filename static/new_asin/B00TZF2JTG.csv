IF  you like Chuck Norris Movies, ... IF you liked the movie, ""Lone Wolf McQuade""  (from 1983, dating yourself, if you haven't and watch action movies,, all can say is YOU MISSED ONE) ,, IF you like the OLD WEST and Texas Rangers, and IF you enjoy Action/Police type TV shows (yes, there is shooting, shows Bad Guys getting shot and a LOT of BG's being knocked around by Walker and his pard Jimmy, which should get PG for violence (though compared to TV shows made in 2018- Walker is mild family show in comparison,,, getting high marks for trying to give 'morals and values for younger folks), then this SET for ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" was made to order for  you.

Entire show, all eight (8) seasons, having FULL 20+ shows PER TV season instead of the 13 shows becoming the standard today, Walker provides a LOT of Entertainment for your money, calculating the COST per HOUR FOR VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT makes Walker an OUTSTANDING VALUE IN $$ PER HOUR.  Plus a bonus extras, this BOX Set received relatively rare 5-stars from this reviewer who normally only gives 4 stars and holds back one for longevity, future problems,, etc.  Almost done with Season 2 and NO issues with any DVD so far, and quick viewing of remaining discs, doubt if any issues will be found.

CON: None really,  TAKE CARE removing disc as they LAYERED one disc over second to save space and overall SIZE of the set.  Press down on tabs in center while slowly lifting outside edge and you'll be okay.  NOT a problem, just a concern or caution on being careful removing disc from box.  Complete set, disc marked Season one, disc number,, booklet provides brief outline on shows subject matter

RECOMMEND.  You bet unless you disagree with anything said above,  well cannot please everyone.  davzway

OK here's what you get in the set: 8 seasons, 198 episodes, 52 disc, & the made for t.v movie Walker, Texas Ranger: Trail By Fire (2005)! All all episodes are as you remember them, great sound & great picture! All episodes are done in full screen and not widescreen, I always prefer full screen! Now on to the 2005 movie, the movie was ok but not great! The plot was good & a big twist toward the end! I didn't like the end of the movie - Alex gets shot & it ends that way, what's up with that! I love 4 them to do some kind of reunion show with the cast! It's  2018 so there's probably never gonna be another movie or reunion show!",1526083200,,797,4.076433121019108

7026490,5,B00TZF2JTG,"I bought the individual seasons as they were released over the years. When I saw this ""Complete Collection"" pack, I had to get it. The main reason was the ""Trial By Fire"" which I don't believe was ever released in any format.

The packaging of the series is very nicely done. I like the fact that it comes in a small box you can put on the shelf. It also sits with my individual seasons DVDs. So Walker Texas Ranger takes up a lot of shelf space for me.

Walker Texas Ranger is one of the best shows of the 90s. There are many great series from that era and Walker has a special place in all that. I remember watching the show many times after school and now I can enjoy it anytime. Even after all these years, the show is still great to watch.

There are certain predictability about the show. I'd like to point them out since I always thought they are funny or amusing.

1) Noble Willingham plays CD Parker for the vast majority of the series. In the show, CD Parker is a retired Texas Ranger with an awesome career. A career so great that they put him in the hall of fame. CD Parker also owns a restaurant and makes a world champion bowl of chili. He has numerous awards for his chillis and very proud of it.

CD Parker sounds like the kind of person anyone in Law Enforcement would dream to be friends with. You'd think that Walker would constantly be coming to CD for advice, or just general chatting about the day to day life in law enforcement. Maybe even coming to CD to discuss current cases or past unsolved cases. Right? Wrong. In the show, not once do we see any of his so-called abilities come out. CD Parker is more of a comic relief and gets frequently beaten to a bloody mess. He ends up in the ER frequently enough. Not once do we see him actually cook anything, too. Several times in the show he's in the main dining area with a stew pot, after hours cooking things. Why is he cooking things after everyone is gone? No idea, but that is when he usually gets pulverized by someone after Walker. Several times in the show, CD Parker goes after criminals only to get pulverized again.

Some of you might notice Noble left the show suddenly. If I remember right, Noble wanted to run for a political office and I don't know if he ever won that or not.

Overall CD Parker is a massive contradiction in the show. He sounds so great, yet they're all in the past. I think CD Parker lands in the ER more than anyone else in the show, and everytime he's there, everyone is just laughing at everything he says.

2) The plot of an episode can be predicted in the first few minutes, if you watch the series long enough. For example, if Walker is exercising with someone, and that someone is a good person who describes some troubles he's facing, then you can predict the entire plot will be that person is killed, Walker goes undercover, and uncovers a massive conspiracy. It seems like after the third season, the writers for Walker Texas Ranger simply gave up and just reused earlier plots to write out more episodes.

3) Along with the predictable plot, the show has many reenactment of movies. If you grew up in the 90s, you watched a lot of great action films. In many episodes of Walker Texas Ranger, you can see reenacted scenes from famous movies of that era. Take for example the Harrison Ford movie, Clear and Present Danger when he went to visit the cartels in South America. His car was ambushed with RPGs and automatic fires and they had to bail out of the car to save themselves. That entire scene was replayed in Walker Texas Ranger as well as many other famous movies of that era.

4) Sometimes I watch the show and think, ""You know I seen this somewhere."" Along with the reenactment of scenes from movies, the show reuse earlier scenes. One of the shows most popular scenes was when Walker was in a helicopter shooting out the tires from a truck. That same scene is reused multiple times for the remainder of the series.

5) By the last season, we can see a noticeable shift in characters' roles. As some of you know, Gage and Sydney came on the show starting from about the last two seasons. I recall reading that Chuck Norris wanted to retire, but he also wanted to keep his co-stars with a job. The network said they didn't want to continue the show without Walker, so Chuck Norris decided to show the network execs that they show could work without him. You can notice a massive shift with Gage and Sydney because they are the main stars in many of the last seasons episodes. Matter of fact, Gage is the only character in the entire show to actually save Chuck Norris from certain death. Also, Trivette was shifted from a series sidekick to that of the comic relief. With CD Parker out of the show, Trivette acted more like the comic relief. It is sort of sad to me that they decided to make him a comic relief than a serious partner in the show. During the last couple of seasons, Trivette was constantly getting pulverized by silly side stories with very silly plots.

As you know, by the last few episode, the network execs decided to pull the plug on the show. Chuck Norris returned the show to its original form during the last episodes with him taking over the main character, Gage and Sydney as a side story with the main plot, and Trivette as his trusty partner. The show went out with a bang.

6) ""Chuck Norris"" co-exists in the Walker Texas Ranger universe. I recall a couple of times when Trivette ended up with deep conversation about Chuck Norris with Walker.

7) The show is a massive advertisements for charities of Chuck Norris. Many of you might not know but Chuck Norris is a devout Christian and throughout the show we see various episodes where Walker tries to help school children stay away from gangs. In real life, Chuck Norris started the program ""Kick Drugs out of America."" I'm not sure if he started with George W Bush, who was a governor at the time of the show, or if it was George HW Bush, but one of the Bush's really liked Chuck Norris's program and endorsed it heavily. In many episodes of the show, Walker is conversing with Governor Bush with his Texas Ranger duties.

In any event, you might not even really notice it, but Chuck Norris heavily invested his charities in this show. I believe the only fictional charity is the one started by Walker's companion Alex Cahill. Every other charity in this show are actual real life charities that Chuck Norris was really involved with.

8) Speaking of Alex Cahill, Walker's girlfriend in this show gets frequently kidnapped and pulverized. It gets funny because Alex is supposed to be a really tough female in this show, yet whenever she gets captured, she's sort of a damsel in distress and only Walker can help her. In many parts of the show Alex helps battered women and there was only a single episode in the entire show where she decided to fight back and win. That episode was where she was helping these battered women and this ex-boyfriend captured one of them. They all joined in on the 2x4 clubbing and Walker just chuckled.

9) Many famous movie stars came on this show as guest characters. Mila Kunis, Hulk Hogen, and many more all had guest appearances in this show. Some were famous, some were going to be famous. Very interested to see that.

10) Criminals in this show are a complete and utter joke. In many episode, Walker is after a really, really tough bad guy with years of history at being a bad guy. These bad guys are also very professional with many of them having eluded international manhunts. For example, this one guy goes from contract killings to contract killings armed with a ice knife. He's so professional that he's able to stab someone surgically and he's able to escape before anyone can be wiser. Yet, Walker got this guy so crazed about him that somehow he decides to break his standards and go nuts trying to kill Walker for whatever reason.

It seems like Walker can trick many criminals in this show with simple things. One of the great interrogation techniques is where Walker tells a bad guy the other guy gave him up and somehow this causes the main guy to spill the beans because he didn't want the other guy to get off. Other times in the show, Walker tricks criminals with a simple, ""Betcha can't...."" Other times, Walker tricks criminals with simple logic like, ""Would you take 100,000 dollars or a penny that doubles everyday?"" And everyone without hesitation says they'll take $100,000 dollars.

Bad guys are so bad that they can't actually tell you how bad they are. This one bad guy was so gruesome that he told this captured woman, ""You know what I'm going to do to you? Do you!?!? I'll tell you..."" and he leans in to whispers into her ear and she's going, ""Oh no, not that! Please, not that!"" And later in the show Walker pulverize this person.

The criminals in this show are a complete and utter joke. It's almost like a really bad cartoon. Aside from Walker massive brutality cases, these criminals would be more of a joke than taken serious.

Overall I really like Walker, Texas Ranger. It is pure gold in some of the scenes and acting. It's definitely one of my favorite shows of the 90s and I would tell anyone to get it. This complete collection pack is definitely worth it as it comes with Trial by Fire which is very rare and I don't believe you'd find it otherwise. It isn't on the series when you buy the individual seasons.",1492214400,10,9395,4.446833236490413

7026527,5,B00TZF2JTG,"Walker Texas Ranger  What A BLAST !!!!!!!!!!

This is probably the most exciting Action series ever produced for TV, these episodes are highly addictive, Chuck Norris is not only a Ranger, but hes got the talents of a superhero. Every type of scenario you can imagine such as car/house explosions, machine gun battles, helicopter manoeuvres, high speed car chases, extortions, kidnappings, high karate fist fights,  brutal violence, non-stop action and suspense with the most heartless villains around  what a Blast!!!!!!

If you're a fan of early Gunsmoke and the newer Justified, this fits right in the middle. The series ran for 8 seasons in the nineties and theres nothing else like it. Chuck Norris was noted for action movies prior to this series (including Code of Silence, The Delta Force,  Lone Wolf McQuade, Missing In Action and Firewalker) , he even taught Elvis Presleys wife Priscilla in the art of karate, you can even catch some of his fights with Elvis on YouTube.

 Highly Recommended!!!!!",1478131200,,1007,5.0606060606060606

7026529,5,B00TZF2JTG,"I love Walker, Texas Ranger because, Every Program Has a Happy Or Positive Ending. In ""Every Episode"", Walker is out to protect, or defend the Innocent, or the Falsely Accused, The Down-Trodden, to help those who've lost hope, or guidance, for those who's traveling down the ""Wrong Path"" of Life, He points you in the ""Right Direction"" & will often correct your Trajectory ""should you stray from it"". He will ""Along with his Faithful Partner"" Kick-The-Crap out of the Bad Guys regardless of their ""Social Status"" or Position, while James Trivette is still trying to figure out his ""Half-Cherokee"" Partner, Walker, or as the Cherokee call him, ""Washo"", Meaning ""Lone Eagle"", uses the well taught Training of his Native American Brethren but, sometimes even he is caught in a dilemma, which is when he returns to his Cherokee Wise Man & Teacher for guidance & counseling. Stubbornly dedicated to the Texas Rangers, sometimes gets him into trouble with the ""Brass"", yet he always seems to find the right way to handle every situation. The Series, Always Heartfelt endings usually brings a tear to my eyes, and always ends with a bright future on the ""Ones"" that were Wronged. Yes, The Eyes of The Ranger are Upon You, Anything Wrong You Do He's Gonna See, When You're in Texas Look Behind You, 'Cause That's Where Th'Ranger's Gonna Be!!!!",1477699200,13,1335,4.88546255506608

7026658,4,B00TZF2JTG,"I LOVED this series when I was in high school. I had every episode on VHS until yesterday when I gave most of them away and bought this wonderful DVD collection. After having received this collection, I just want to make several things clear to others looking to purchase this.

This is NOT a boxed set! This, appears to be each individual season packaged as they originally came out (the packaging is not consistent throughout all seasons) and plastic wrapped around the whole thing to keep them together. I recall this may have been slightly more expensive than ordering them individually. You're not paying extra for a nice boxed set. This is not a complaint from me. I could care less. They'll actually shelve better this way! I just want people to be aware that while the picture looks like a boxed set, it's not.

Also, the reasons for me taking a star off: I don't see the ""Behind-the-Scenes with Walker, Texas Ranger"" anywhere on any of these discs. This was a one hour documentary thingy on the making of the show that was aired, I believe, during the third season. I'm bummed that it's not here. WHY?!?!?! It should be.

The other reason, is sorta not entirely valid for this, but I'll mention it anyway for those who may not be familiar with the spin off of WTR, called Sons of Thunder. In the fourth season of WTR, there was a two part episode called ""Sons of Thunder"". During some later season, they took the two main characters from that episode and created a short lived spin off. I think there were about six episodes, total. While the original ""Sons of Thunder"" episode is included here, as it was a true WTR episode, none of the actual spin off episodes are here. At this time (February 2015) I have not seen the spin off show on DVD at all. So, I'm kind of sad these aren't in this set, but I can also understand why, as they were a different show in their own right. Consider this, then, just an FYI.

Otherwise, as far as I can tell, all the episodes are accounted for and everything arrived in great shape. Just, for such a great show, I wish there'd been at least that one extra added on and I really don't know why it wasn't. I would have rated this five stars, if I were simply rating the TV show on it's own merits, btw, because it was that good. But the DVDs are slightly lacking in at least one area. lol.

That said, obviously, if you're a huge fan, you probably still need to own this. And if you're debating whether or not you would like this show, you should get it anyway, because you'll love it. Lots of kick-ass action, a long romance arc, true justice of the west being done. Sure, there are odd things like one episode Alex can kick-ass herself and the next she's completely helpless and getting kidnapped, but go with it, it's more fun that way.",1423699200,10,2783,4.406614785992218

I don't do business with Columbia House anymore. for one, they charge way to much S.H. and they can be very disrespectful when it comes to pre orders. they did this to me many times. Back when I pre ordered ""Man of Steel"" it took them months to get my copy to me. I had to keep on calling Columbia House, Where is my copy of Man of Steel? finally I gave up bought from Amazon. It cost me less then what Columbia House was charging. So I buy all my DVDs here from Amazon.

My dad and I loved watching it in re-runs through the years and now that he's no longer with us, I still feel like he's there whenever I watch Walker kicking some butt. I find myself saying the same stuff Dad used to when the fight scene is going on, ""Get him! Kick him! C'mon Walker, don't let him hit you!"" You get the idea. Happily the fact that Dad watched this show got my daughter interested in it. She loved watching it at college and now we can enjoy it together.

7026718,1,B00TZF2JTG,"I watched this steely jarred character a couple of times.  Cowboy hat Ninja.  What I want to say is this Chuck Norris is one of the most irresponsible public personalities right now.  On his Facebook page he and his wife are denouncing our President, Barack Obama, and claiming in pseudo mystical words that when our President is re-elected it will be the most terrible time for this country.  The end of the world kind of terrible.  Their rant is alarming.  Alarming because Mr. Norris has a supportive fan base.  And it is irresponsible simply because of that.  Say what you will about our President to state and use your fame to bolster your words that the end of the world IS quite literally on the horizon is irresponsible, unprofessional and just plain stupid.  John Wayne, another die hard steely jarred Republican would NEVER talk like this.  I don't know what the motive is behind the Facebook rant of Mr. Norris.  But I do know it is irresponsible and dumb.  About as dumb as most of his films, some of which I've seen, and as dumb as this series.  As an aside no more dumb than alot of current television.

But Mr. Norris, you'd better hope Mr. Obama wins another 4 years.  Because if Romeny/Ryan wins, this $119.00 price tag for your complete series will be totally beyond the abilities of the white working class people who from my perspective seem to be your biggest audience.  They won't be able to afford this at all.  Not after Romney/Ryan dismantles every program that is currently in place helping to put working class lives back together.

Mr. Norris your blatant words will come back to haunt you in the pocketbook if people are silly enough swallow your Facebook rant.  The poor will be even poorer and the middle class will become a cypher and none of these people will be able to buy any of you films.  No purchases, no money.

Another Republican ""acting"" against his self interest.  Why am I so suprised?

But I'll say one thing for Mr. Norris and that is by the early 80's he was one of the first who openly supported our Vietnam Vets.  How years later he can come up with this diatribe on Facebook, this ""Revelations"" style rant is beyond me.  I hope it will be beyond anyone one else who reads it too.",1346889600,6,2229,4.526315789473684
7026719,5,B00TZF2JTG,Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up from the discount box at best buy. Best purchase I have ever made! Walker has taught me so many life lessons so im now a man. Whether this is the complete series or not don't worry you will get enough texas ranger to think you live in arlingon. Also to finish my title ...and chuck broke the mold so no others would come after him.,1346716800,,376,4.236111111111111
7026720,5,B00TZF2JTG,"This is a great fun show to watch. I have all the seasons 1-8.

There is nothing new here. They just put seasons 1-8 in a box and that is it.

And they still did not put Trial By Fire with it. Sad deal! They should of put that with it. Then you would have everything.
I have been looking for that DVD. Still out of luck...

Have a good one people!",1346630400,3,347,3.7916666666666665
7026721,5,B00TZF2JTG,I like this series because Cordell Walker is a half indian and half white man who also is a Texas Ranger.  He believes in the law and justice.  He does whatever it takes to bring in the bad guys. He also is very well known and feared by villians and run when he comes their way.  Walker is very active in the community helping children stay away from drugs through a program he helped to create for the kids.  He also helps anyone who wants to change from being a bad guy to a good guy.  Walker even learns that love is the most important thing and living without it makes life less interesting.  He gets married and learns the challenges of marriage.  He also loses a very close friend but he uses it to reach out to people.  This is a really good series that shows how the law works and lives get intertwined through everday contact.,1346112000,21,835,4.2405063291139244

7026724,4,B00TZF2JTG,"I've always enjoyed this series, to the point where I occasionally choose an episode at random to watch again.  For a TV series, the plots are surprisingly well constructed, albeit considerably contrived, and many produce genuine excitement and suspense.  Of course, others are just plain silly.  The fight scenes are equally contrived but are nevertheless quite entertaining.  Chuck Norris might not have been much of an actor but he is convincing when holding a thug by the throat.  Finally, there is palpable chemistry among the cast, especially between Chuck and the delightful Sheree J. Wilson.",1330819200,8,599,5.2631578947368425

7026727,5,B00TZF2JTG,"I had to give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price.  I think it's a little pricey compared to other TV shows, but it's totally worth it in the end.  Walker Texas Ranger always teaches good values.  I wish there were more shows like this on  TV.

A word about Amazon... I purchased this set directly from Amazon and it was $5 less the following day and then $13 less the following week.  They would not credit my account even though I hadn't received it yet.  LAME.  I guess I could send it back and then buy it again, but that is more hassle than it's worth.  Many of the DVD cases were broken - so the DVD sloshes around inside the case.

UPDATE:  It's Walker.  It deserves 5 stars!  I watched the whole series in about 3 months.  The organization and descriptions of each episode are great.",1322870400,10,802,4.225165562913907

7026731,2,B00TZF2JTG,"After questioning others on message boards who already purchased this box set, I found out that it does NOT include the official last Walker episode/movie called Trial By Fire, which aired on CBS a few years after the season finale of Walker.  This is a real shame and doesn't make sense why they would leave this last episode out??  It's basically the ONLY Walker episode that is NOT included in this box set.  I LOVE the Walker series, but I can only rate this box set 2 stars, because it simply isn't the COMPLETE collection as others on here have falsely stated.  The ONLY official release of the last episode, Trial By Fire was place separately on an import DVD only in Europe, not in the US, and isn't compatible with US DVD players.  Maybe one day, they will release it as a separate DVD in the US.  The box set didn't come out til 2010, so I guess there's still hope.

7026739,5,B00TZF2JTG,"All of the seasons are here in this pack (Seasons 1-8), with of course the exception of the special made for TV movies.  There is technically no Season 9.  The reason being is because the first three episodes were ""Pilot"" episodes to see if the show would be a hit, which comprised a kind of pre Season 1/Season 1.  Once the show took off the creators made 24 more episodes, which made up the official first season.  Technically we can combine the three Pilot Episodes with Season 1, giving us a total of 27 episodes for a complete first season.  I do not have the box set but do have the individual seasons that I purchased as the shows were released.  If you compare the photographs of the complete box set with the individual seasons you will see they are identical.  I received Season 7 today, and compared the episode list with the one found here ([...]), and they match up (with the exception of the fact that the Wikipedia list in one of the seasons reorders a few of the shows when compared with DVD jacket, a minor error on Wikipedia's part I believe).
