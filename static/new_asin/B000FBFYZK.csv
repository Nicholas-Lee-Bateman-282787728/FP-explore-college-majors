8120158,5,B000FBFYZK,"We gave this 5 stars because there are no commercials, there are no previews, and the quality is good.

The content is exactly what I had expected, but it is the small details relating to getting the show on the road and lack of interruptions that rated this a 5 star product for us.",1378684800,,283,4.2407407407407405

8120161,3,B000FBFYZK,"Our family enjoyed watching this DVD, except for the way they ended it. Everything was going along ok until the last candy factory.  It was suckers with real insects inside.  Repulsive!  We haven't wanted to watch it again.  I guess you could say it left a bad taste in our mouths for the entire DVD.",1280880000,,300,4.4

Hershey bought candy-making equipment at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and went into business soon after in Lancaster, PA. Chocolate candy production requires drying, roasting, cleaning, and grinding cocoa beans, then mixing, heating and cooling, pouring and wrapping the product. Most cocoa beans come from Africa, South America, and Indonesia.

Sees Candy began operations in 1921 in Los Angeles.

Sugar from sugar cane was first made in 500 B.C. in India. Europe eventually learned of it, though little could be used until they learned how to grow sugar beets in the 18th century.

Some small local candy-makers (eg. Shimph's, since 1891 in Jefferson, Ind.) conduct their manufacturing in full-view of appreciative outside audiences.

Jellybeans were first made in the late 1880s - the product was seen as small Easter eggs. ""Candy"" goes on to show how jellybeans, salt-water taffy, Red Vines, candy canes, and high-priced candies are made.

Viewers also learn that unsweetened licorice sticks were found in King Tut's tomb.",1225411200,,1216,5.307291666666667

8120164,5,B000FBFYZK,"The captions are EXCELLENT--word-for-word, no mistakes, and no messiness. THANKS A&E!!!

The documentary itself is also fascinating, showing everything from the history and harvesting of cacao beans on down to eating in action, even such ""treats"" as candied scorpions and insects. I found it interesting to see where everyday candy, like Hersheys and Jelly Bellies, come from, as well as candy I've never heard of.",1218758400,,414,5.369230769230769
