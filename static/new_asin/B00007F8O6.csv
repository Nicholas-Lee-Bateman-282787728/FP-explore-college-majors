7975606,5,B00007F8O6,"OH MY GOSH!  I was totally duped into getting this video.  There was nothing I already didn't know (I know, it is a double negative).  No secrets were unlocked so it became a piece of low quality porn put on by a couple of the most unattractive women with bodies that just help in the argument against porn.  In short, this is a no information video that will make you appreciate your significant other's body more; so I guess there is some benefit to it.",1306886400,,455,4.317647058823529
7975607,1,B00007F8O6,"It's funny how it seems that most videos by Sinclair are just outright poor in pretty much every way according most reviews... This is no exception... Poor quality production value, very UNATTRACTIVE couples, crappy looking sex, simply all around unpleasant. If you actually do give MONEY for this, remember this review. Why you didn't believe I really meant *EVERYTHING* is bewildering...",1291593600,,389,5.39344262295082
7975608,1,B00007F8O6,"The female narrator throughout this DVD sounds like flight attendant giving routine instructions on flight saftey in a very robotic type way.  The doctors and professionals that were interviewed were insightful and tasteful, but when they cut to the actors and the play by play annoucing, it becomes uncofortable to watch - purely biological rather than sensual.  It's like watching a poorly made show on Discovery called ""When Humans Mate"" with new age elevator music in the background.  BUT, it might be helpful to 55+ year old couples out there.",1166227200,11,548,5.066666666666666
7975609,3,B00007F8O6,"Great video.  I went from ""Hey Shorty, is that all you have to Let's do it again"" using what I learned in this book. The word gets around when you give women what they deserve. I now have women calling me asking for a date.  What a change.",1128643200,3,239,3.9583333333333335
7975610,1,B00007F8O6,"It is really a shame that they sell this video to people who are looking for guidance in such a sensitive and important area of life.  This video is a real discredit to the instructional genre.  There are some truly great videos out there that teach everything you need to know about the G-Spot.  The best ones I would recommend are ""New Sex Now"" or ""Goddess Worship"" if you are mature and adventurous, or ""New Free Sex"" if you are a prude.  Don't let this weak Better Sex Video turn you off or ruin your experience with instructional videos.",1078876800,34,542,4.444444444444445
