1210673,5,B00000FCNI,"This is another of my favorite female movies. It is sensitive and moving
and funny.  Not to be missed in my estimation.
Can't count how many times I have watched it. This is definitely a time
that has passed us by and probably never will return.",1223856000,4,245,4.326086956521739
1210674,3,B00000FCNI,"I'm a Liza Minnelli MEGA fan and I had not had the opportunity to watch this movie of hers before, yet I wanted to add the film to my DVD library. Ms Minnelli's performance as ""Cara Varnum"" is fabulous, I also loved the portrayal of the homeless woman ""Mr. Goo"" by Kathy Bates... superb! However, I found the movie a bit boring at times and somehow very long with many senseless parts that do not add to the core of the story. It is just one of those hard to find but gotta have movies! Jennifer Grey's acting in this picture it is just appalling, very hard to believe she is actually Joel Grey's daughter...hummm...one of those occasions that the acting genes did not obviously carry down to the next generation. Liza as usual...one of a kind! Forever LIZA!",1179446400,3,758,4.460431654676259
1210675,2,B00000FCNI,"It was a big waste of talent.  None of the characters are developed..you never feel as you know or care to know them.  Too bad.  Each actress was doing her best, but it doesn't make up for the poor screen play and direction.",1145059200,4,224,4.162790697674419
1210676,4,B00000FCNI,Delightful little film with heartwarming performance by all 3 Academy Award Winning actresses. The only reason I'm giving this movie 4 stars is for the uneven transfer.,1077753600,10,168,5.2592592592592595

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017
Im not really sure how to categorize this movie. Its a friendship movie, its supposed to be a comedy, its supposed to be a drama, its mostly about older people, and its one of those older person and younger person help each other movies. And, pretty much every twenty minutes, the screen fades to black, making you think its the end, but the movie keeps going. Each section seems to take a new direction, so its not really a comedy or a drama or a romance or a tearjerker.

If a movie with a handicapped Shirley MacLaine, a socially awkward Liza Minnelli, a homeless Kathy Bates, and a heavily made-up Jennifer Grey, all helping each other with friendship appeals to you, give it a whirl. Its only 90 minutes, and even though its a little dated, it won't hurt you.",1498521600,,826,4.434210526315789

7908130,5,B00000FCNI,"I grew up on the upper West Side.  I lived at the ""Beresford,"" just a few blocks from the ""Ansonia"" the apartment/hotel represented in the film.  I knew people just like this bunch of characters who shared similar problems in life.  It was like ""going home.""  Nicely acted.  It could have been so overdone, but everything felt real. Really!!!",1244851200,6,342,4.728813559322034
7908131,5,B00000FCNI,"This is one of the best movies I've seen. Some of the criticism in these reviews is really nitpicking. The message, meaning, and acting in this movie puts it way up there in this wasted era of super heroes and special effects. Movies used to be about real people being human. Let us hope we will someday return to more movies that touch our hearts with stories about the human condition as this one does.",1227916800,5,404,4.4
