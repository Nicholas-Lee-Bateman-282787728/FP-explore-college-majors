8534964,2,B00930L7K0,The only reason I gave a second star is the accuracy to which it follows the book. Other than that the acting is HORRENDOUS!!!! Fanny Price is pathetic and totally unfit. The filming is good for having been filmed in the 80s. Lady Bertrams character is an attempt at portraying her lanquidity but comes across as very annoying. Avoid this version! Youre better off with the 1999 version (even with the lberalities it takes).,1529193600,,424,4.743243243243243

8534966,4,B00930L7K0,"Jane Austen wrote MANSFIELD PARK between 1812-14 and published it in July of 1814. This 1983 BBC broadcast is a thorough, well-made and acted adaptation.

Populated mostly by creepy, venal and dishonorable bluebloods, ""Mansfield Park"" has two likeable characters that endure various travails but end up happily ever after.

Le Touzel's demure Fanny Price is spot-on. Farrell, who was only 28 at the time, still seems a bit old for Edmund. Massey's scheming leech Aunt Norris is delighfully detestable. Too bad she never gets her comeuppance.

This six-part miniseries is worth the investment of time to see.
