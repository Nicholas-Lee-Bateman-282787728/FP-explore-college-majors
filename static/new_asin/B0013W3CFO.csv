8253137,5,B0013W3CFO,"This is one of the best instructional videos I have come across. I am a beginner and the techniques and adaptive techniques (variations of original technique which depends on attacker's actions) are shown multiple times and then reviewed and broken down in an easy to follow style (visually and verbally). The reviews of techniques have a dual visual with close up and a farther view so you can see the technique for contact and the footwork too, which I like. The techniques by the way are practical and brutal. I think it would also be good for new instructors to see it, in order to learn how to explain things better to their students. He shows the techniques both quickly and then slowly for educational purposes. I highly recommend it, and I plan to watch it again.....and again.",1399248000,,785,4.695652173913044
8253138,1,B0013W3CFO,"The adaptive techniques that are shown in this DVD aren't that very impressive or practical, except for two good ones. When Jerry Meyers executes the techniques, he does so without speed or fluidity, his explanations are disjointed and lack specifics. Disregard the review of the person who trained under Jerry Meyers for 30 years, it is extremely bias and is not objective.
Adaptive Kenpo is 60 minutes long, but most of the time is filled with the narrator repeating the basic mechanical steps for each modification, with no additional knowledge is gain by this. The DVD includes a total of thirteen of Jerry Meyers' own modifications of American Kenpo techniques, such as Clutching Feathers, Lone Kimono and Triggered Salute. In the explanation of his adaptations for Clutching Feathers it took him 25 seconds for the first modification and 20 seconds for the second modification. Being concise is a very important part of the learning process since inundating someone with too much information would hinder the growth of the student; but Mr. Meyers' explanations are not concise, they are just short and he does not explain anything in depth. In Adaptive Kenpo less than ten minutes are actually spent discussing modified Kenpo techniques. Some of the techniques, such as Lone Kimono, have only one modification and the first adaptation for Triggered Salute consisted of him listing different strikes that could be used",1319673600,,1423,5.1645021645021645
