8087887,3,B000BKDO9I,"Definitely for 'Kung Fu Hustle' fans (especially with the Landlady and her husband also costarring here!), though not nearly as good ... but still quite funny, and even with a serious storyline, within the humor, that will touch the heart. Not so sure I liked the ending - it felt sort of rushed/cut off - but overall a fun film, though I now wish I knew how to play Mahjong so could have understood those scenes a bit more!",1356998400,,424,4.379746835443038
8087888,2,B000BKDO9I,"<strong>Jeuk Sing</strong> (Siu-hung Chung and Jing Wong, 2005)

<em>Jeuk Sing</em>, released in English-speaking countries as <em>Kung Fu Mahjong</em>, was enough of a success in its native China that it inspired two equally cheap sequels (as I write this in August 2012, you can see the entire trilogy on Netflix Streaming, though how long it will last there is anyone's guess). But, honestly, this cheapie action-comedy is so badly-written and fails to rise above its potential for mediocrity so often it feels just like a typical Hollywood rom-com, only the ""rom"" parts are replaced by mahjong games. Does it work? Not really.

Plot: Chi Mo Sai (<em>Kung Fu Hustle</em>'s Wah Yuen) is a professional gambler who loses his shirt--literally--in a game and finds himself locked in a cage by a couple of loansharks. He escapes from them and ducks into a local diner to hide out, where he meets waiter Ah Wong (<em>Visible Secret II</em>'s Roger Kwok), known by the diner's regulars for his eidetic memory. Chi Mo Sai sees the obvious potential if he can get the kid educated in mahjong, and takes him to old friend Auntie Fei (<em>Rumble in Hong Kong</em>'s Qiu Yuen, returning to the screen after a twenty-year hiatus), the Queen of Mahjong, to train. There's more to it than that: Ah Wong is enamored of Cheryl (<em>Fatal Contact</em>'s Theresa Fu), an amateur badminton player he passes every day on his way home from work, and Chi Mo Sai concocts a way to get these two kids together...

...all of which is well and good, except that, well, it isn't. The loanshark plotline disappears into thin air after about twenty minutes, the romantic subplot after about forty. And Chi Mo Sai's lifelong pal, who he gets kidnapped with in the opening scene? Where did he go? No idea. All of this kind of gets swept under the rug as the plot whisks on too quickly for such niceties. Which makes this a fun, fast-paced little comedy, as long as you're willing to ignore the bits that go missing. **",1347235200,,1989,4.793002915451895
8087889,4,B000BKDO9I,this is not Kung Fu hustle but it is a good movie.  good enough that they made two more.  has a nice level of action and comedy slapstick.  there is not a lot of Kung Fu action through out.  and it is more on the subterfudge they use like counting tiles and cheating.,1269907200,2,267,3.981132075471698

8087892,5,B000BKDO9I,"The husband and wife of Kung Fu Hustle star alongside a hilarious cast in this entertaining film. This is actually one of my all-time favorite movies! The actors are all really funny, the storyline is great, and you will be surprised that there are some sad moments in the film as well. The storyline is a wacky gambler tries to outrun people he owes money to and accidentally stumbles upon a waitor in a restaurant who is a young man with a superhuman memory. He can remember any order anyone throws at him once and repeat them all perfectly. For example, "" I want egg omelet, with tabasco sauce on one side but not the other, three coffees, one with brown sugar and cream, one with the sugar and no cream, and one with only milk, 4 hashbrowns, 2 of them cooked halfway only..."" those aren't actual lines from movie but you get idea. The waitor has several people throwing outrageous orders at him that are long and complicated and he doesn't write them down, he remembers every word as soon as he hears. He can even read the phonebook just once and memorize each word perfectly in it. So the gambler sees him as opportunity and tries to teach the young man how to gamble and play mahjong so they can play tournaments and make big money. Unfortunately they are up against some pretty bad mob bosses and also the young man's aunt (the lady from kungfu hustle) who is dead set against him gambling and playing mahjong. Plus, the young man falls in love with a girl but it has deadly consequences. If you guys watch the film, you will laugh all the way through and fall in love with these memorable characters and constantly be surprised at each new twist.",1171238400,4,1654,4.462046204620462
8087893,4,B000BKDO9I,"Spin-off from Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer genre, cheerily contrived and hammed up.  Sad love story of mistaken identity whit the Mahjong prodigy hero and the casino boss's daughter...  Loved it.  Funny acting and great showdown ending.  Features the ""Ten Commandments of Mahjong"" sequence, perfect for students and masters alike.  Special features includes Mahjong for Dummies primer menu.  I'm happy to own it.",1136505600,12,417,5.4375
