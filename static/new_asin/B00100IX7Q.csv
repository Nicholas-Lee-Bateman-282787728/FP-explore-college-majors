You can do that fairly quickly with this as a guide and dedication and with in less than a month you will start seeing results.  Don't forget the body bands.

3044750,3,B00100IX7Q,I really like this workout but to do it properly you really need to have longer bands. I got the Pilates body bands that appeared to go with this DVD and found out right away that they are way too short for this workout. I wish that this workout DVD recommend what length bands to use for the best work out.,1389312000,,307,4.049180327868853
3044751,5,B00100IX7Q,"This is the second copy of this dvd I have purchased.  The first one lasted almost 10 years.  Any workout DVD that one wears out from regular use over years is a very good workout DVD in my opinion.

I like the way that this dvd includes clear but unobtrusive advice on modifying the moves to fit one's own range of ability.

Learning Pilates with a stretch band helps protect one from injuries because of the support the band provides. That said, it's always a good idea to, as the DVD recommends, do the workout without the band and with minimal effort to become accustomed to the moves.

This workout is very portable--I've taken it with me to other countries where gyms and pilates studios were not always available.",1359072000,8,720,4.550387596899225

A light but thorough workout using resistance bands, you can make this workout as challenging as you choose. Mimicking exercises that you'd do with a Pilates reformer, Ana Caban has created a program that works all muscles, and in a 35-minute time frame.

You won't burn 500 calories doing this but you'll definitely tone every muscle in your body and finish feeling revitalized and calm.

Would love them to re-shoot this in higher definition.",1500422400,,488,5.0

8236442,5,B00100IX7Q,I used this workout in my 20's to supplement my cardio with a resistance stretching routine. I was thrilled to find it again in my late 40's. I prefer to workout in my home. This is a wonderful workout because it can be modified by following the other instructor if you have an injury or neck or back problems that restrict your movements. The movements provide a great stretch without over doing it. I feel energized when I am finished not so sore that I can't move the next day. This is still my go to for a good stretch before my workout.,1489363200,2,541,4.262135922330097

8236445,3,B00100IX7Q,"I hadn't done much Pilates before this DVD it was a good easy intro and the band helped with resistance, helping you to tone a little faster.  Ana Caban was a likable instructor she had good cuing and led you through a good Pilates workout.  Though the band helped tone faster, I found it a little distracting to the Pilates.  You had to re-position it a few times and it just seemed to get in the way a little sometimes.  I guess I am more of a fan of a traditional style Pilates.",1446422400,,481,4.139784946236559

8236447,4,B00100IX7Q,"I originally bought this DVD a number of years ago in a set that came with three of the longer bands.  The DVD quit working after some years of use but I had such fond memories of it that I went looking for another copy.  (I have another bodyband DVD from the same instructor but it is somewhat more difficult.  I have not been exercising as much as I should have been these past few months due to life circumstances, so I wanted to (re)start at a more basic level.  Hence seeking out this DVD.)

First thing to note: you *do* need the longer bands.  I think the reason this is not mentioned on the DVD is because the DVDs were originally produced as part of the set I had -- so they came with the necessary equipment.  If you are looking for a band to use with this workout, Amazon has plenty in the 6-7 foot range, which should be more than sufficient for most purposes.  (Having one that is too long is fine.  Having one that is too short will not work.)

Please inspect your bands prior to doing the DVD.  You don't want want to snap on you!  (If you have extras, you can store them in a zip-top bag with some baby powder.  I had one last for more than 10 years this way.)

But on to the DVD.  The music is appropriate, relaxing even.  And not distracting at all.  This is done with three demonstrators in a serene outdoor environment.  Ana Caban, the instructor, does non-modified moves, as does the woman to the right of the screen.  The woman to the left does some modified moves that would be suitable for beginners.  You can also vary the intensity of the workout by switching bands.  You would probably also want a yoga mat unless you are working out on carpet (one of the thick, padded mats would be even better).  Ms. Caban seems friendly and capable.

This was my first experience with Pilates and it is still my favorite.  I often find Pilates DVDs too hard on my neck, but I did not find this one to be so.  Some moves are recognizable (you do ""the hundred,"" for example) and others are specific to the bands.

One thing you can also do is use some of the strength-type moves with the bands to create your own workouts with more repetitions.  Because you really don't do a ton of repetitions of any one exercise.

I do not break a sweat when I do this workout, and I was not in any kind of pain the next day.  You are probably not going to lose a significant amount of weight if this is all you do.  I am using it more as a stepping stone to get back into more difficult Pilates workouts, during a week in which I do cardio an average of 4-5 times and some strength training as well.  I do like the focus on the core in this, but you also do some upper and lower body moves, so it's pretty balanced overall.

Minor annoyance: There is a lengthy, non-skippable, non-fast-forwardable Gaiam commercial at the beginning, as well as an introduction by the instructor.  I don't want to watch these every time I do the DVD.  (Thankfully my DVD player remembers the last place I stopped, from which point I can go to the DVD menu.)",1439856000,6,3038,4.253496503496503
