This was really quirky and interesting, lol.  Caught me by surprise.  It opens kinda slow but once you see what this maid is up to, it's amusing to follow her voyeuristic adventures.  Those looking for action and erotica are going to be disappointed and will think this is slow all the way through... it's more on the cerebral side and you have to have an appreciation for things like silence and subtleties.

Lynn is a shy and obsessive-compulsive hotel maid with a history of being committed. She's crippled by her issues and lives a very solitary life, rarely speaking to or interacting with others... and yet she is endlessly fascinated by the minutiae of their private moments and personal things.  So fascinated that when she's not going through their personal things and trying on their clothes and such, she hides under their hotel beds and lives vicariously through their every action and interest. Sometimes she'll go to an empty room and wait under the bed until it's rented and just ride with it... spend the night... whatever, lol.  She sneaks out when they are in the bathroom. For a shy girl, this odd little maid takes some bold risks!!

And then there's the OCD cleaning.  Lynn is always cleaning.  She cleans her home and the hotel rooms obsessively.  She even goes under the bed to vacuum the mattress bottom, lol.  She cleans rooms that aren't even rented and already clean.  Clearly... she's got issues.

When she finds herself under the bed of a client with a hot bleached blond dominatrix... the light BDSM she encounters intrigues her.  Lynn wants to be hit.  She gets Chiara's number and arranges a meeting.  Soon they are seeing each other regularly and something close to intimacy ensues.

They are an interesting mix, these two...  Lynn so wholesome and this prostitute so.... other. One of my favorite things about this film is the casting.  I think Lynn is very attractive in a girl-next-door nondescript way... and the Domme is so striking and androgynous... such a womanly body and such a handsome face.  They complement each other physically and mentally and are very interesting to watch together. There is one slightly graphic F/F sex scene... but most of their get-togethers are more about how they connect after and that's all we see.  So don't come here looking for graphic stuff.

This is an odd one with some quirky charm... definitely worth a watch if you like these kinds of character studies.  This is definitely not a coming out story.  Nor is it a F/F romance.  Quirky and thoughtful character study seems a better fit.

* There are a couple of M/F sex scenes... one is kinda graphic.",1437782400,21,2672,4.789934354485776

7296455,4,B00ZZ8P8XG,"Along the Blue is the Warmest Color genre, much more edited, subtle and with a different twist. The fascination I had was with the emotions of Lynn, the Chambermaid, her repressed, stoic sadness and self-deprecating, slightly deranged outlook on life. She experiences a mysterious woman with a 'client' while hiding under the bed of the hotel room she cleans, and then pursues an unusual arrangement with this dark yet kind woman. Through sexuality she was looking to escape this desolation of self and find excitement and intimacy. The end leaves you questioning her psychological origins and mysterious relationship to her own Mother.",1442793600,2,636,5.245098039215686

7296458,4,B00ZZ8P8XG,"Some little films come along that challenge the status quo of current cinema menus. Such is the case with this little film that dares go places others fear  and it is to the credit of Film Movement to keep these before our eyes. Without the use of apocalyptic subject matter or robots or building explosions or cars crashes or potty mouth dialogue or the repetitious Marvel Comics backlog of reruns, THE CHAMBERMAID is simply a study of one young girls mind  the past effects of abuse and mental illness, and the need to be loved or at least truly desired.

The unlikely pairing of an obsessive-compulsive chambermaid and an androgynous dominatrix proves oddly liberating for the eponymous heroine of this film. The beauty of cleaning is that everything gets dirty again is the motto of Lynn (Vicky Krieps), someone who needs to cling to what she knows in order to at least feel safe, though routines, places and objects initially seem preferable to people. In time Lynn is seen handling guests objects and then secretly begins to spy on them in their rooms, it slowly becomes clear that she's starting to find other people fascinating, if perhaps a bit startling. In her obsessive-compulsive role as a chambermaid she crawls under a bed to vacuum the bottom of a mattress, or uses a dentists angled mirror to check that shes scrubbed all the dirt from the underside of a toilet rim. She rarely interacts with others, yet is endlessly curious about how others live, inspecting their habits with the kind of baffled interest generally reserved for other species. She tries on their clothes (mens as well as womens), examines the pictures in their wallets and reads the inscriptions on their rings. She even hides beneath their beds to observe them unseen. Along comes a guest (Christian Aumer) with a bottle-blond dominatrix, Chiara (Lena Lauzemis), experienced almost entirely through the use of sound and the brilliant face of Lynn, whos hiding under the bed and can only image what must be going on. Through Chiara, it dawns on Lynn that pain doesnt necessarily need to be negative and that intimacy can happen in a context thats a lot more controlled than in real life (read: paid for). This sets into motion the films last act, which may be predictable emotionally: the encounter has less to do with S&M than with a slow, careful initiation into intimacy, Chiara seeming to know just how to gently nudge her client into accepting, then welcoming, her touch; their sex-for-hire transactions morph into something deeper, their lovemaking achieving a unique blend of force and tenderness. Lynn learns to interact directly with another human being while Chiara discovers a genuine liking for her pupil. Chiara is amused by Lynns strictly regimented routine, just as Lynn is bemused by the lack of structure in Chiaras freelance lifestyle.

New subject matter realized in a very sensitive way, this film will fascinate those fatigued by movies that rely solely on special effects as opposed to human stories. Masterfully directed by Ingo Haeb. Grady Harp, August 15",1440806400,2,3064,4.94368932038835

7296461,3,B00ZZ8P8XG,"Quirky?  Ok, I'll give you that.  The dialogue is so sparse that you can turn the volume to 10 and not worry about waking the kids.  I'm sure the entire script could fit on less than 10 pages.  It's a slow moving story where a lot of time is spent watching the main character think silently about choices made or ones she's about to make, which can be refreshing after the typical Hollywood movie that requires 5 gun fights and at least 2 explosions within the first 15 minutes.  If you like watching a shapely woman undress and dress, there are quite a few scenes of that.  It's somewhat interesting and would be more so to those inclined towards mild S&M.  I found it a bit too slow and silent to give it more than 3 stars.",1439164800,7,725,4.248175182481752

Shy, underspoken, reserved, she is brought out of her shell by an escort she sees with a client while hiding under a bed and who she ends up calling.

8721176,4,B00ZZ8P8XG,"This is an extremely poignant movie about isolation. Lynn is a woman who emerged some time earlier from a self-imposed period in a mental hospital and who sees a therapist on a weekly basis but tells him nothing about the truth of her existence. She has obsessive-compulsive disorder which, as a hotel chambermaid, is an asset as it makes her excellent at her job. But yearning to connect with others and to understand them, Lynn takes to hiding under the bed in the guest rooms while the guests themselves go about their private business unaware of her presence. In this way she learns how others live and in some ways she seeks to emulate them, most notably by paying a dominatrix to visit her on her Saturdays off.

Not surprisingly, Lynn develops a crush on the dominatrix and not surprisingly the dominatrix does not reciprocate. In the end Lynn goes to visit her mother when her suggestion (and gift) of a two-week vacation is ignored.

If you like implausible action-packed movies full of clichd dialog, stock situations, cardboard characters and violence along with the requisite Hollywood necessity of firearms this movie is going to disappoint you greatly. There are no jump-cuts, no clumsy expositions (""Why is X doing this, Jenny?"" ""It must be because he had a difficult relationship with his mom."" ""My god! You're right!"") and no race to the great ""reveal"" at the end. This is just a painstaking gentle observation of one lonely woman's life. The tiny details are superb - such as when, near the end, Lynn tries to embrace her mother and puts her hand on her mother's shoulder and the mother tentatively begins to stretch her own fingers towards those of her daughter but... doesn't quite connect. An entire relationship is captured in this poignant moment. And that's how the movie works. Everything is understated. It assumes the audience is paying attention and can make connections without everything being spelled out.

Whereas Hollywood is Movies For Dummies, this is Movies For Adults. So if you're an adult and you like well-observed and well-acted films, this is one to add to your watch-list.",1444176000,,2115,4.902234636871508
