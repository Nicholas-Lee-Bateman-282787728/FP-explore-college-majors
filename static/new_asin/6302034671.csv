7820093,2,6302034671,About halfway through it got really slow.... and I just can't get past the ignorant remarks about injured servicemen- it left me feeling sick long after the documentary ended.,1506384000,,175,5.068965517241379
7820094,5,6302034671,"WOW!  This is one of those ""There but for the grace of God go I"" and an up close demonstration of how some friends and relatives can act civilized.
Wonderful documentary.",1502841600,,170,4.483870967741935
7820095,5,6302034671,"I wanted to start off by saying that this is without a doubt one of my FAVORITE documentaries ever, period.
Another excellent one which is similar is 'I Am Not A Freak' from 1987, it's just about an hour long, while this one is much longer. And unfortunately I Am Not A Freak is only on VHS (at the time of this review, July 23rd, 2017).
I have loved this documentary since I was a kid, I first saw it when I was about 10. I rented it on VHS from a local mom and pop video store here in Arkansas, expecting a horror movie (due to the cover), instead I got one of the most amazing documentaries I had ever seen.
Being 10 years old at the time, documentaries usually made me fall asleep within the first 10 minutes of me watching them.
But this one, I was glued to the screen. I was so interested in all the people. I couldn't help but wonder where they were today, how they were doing, and I wanted to meet them.
I eventually bought the VHS from the video store and I still own it. Later I bought the Japanese VHS online from 'Family Video Theater'.
But this Blu-Ray is pure gold. If you love this film, BUY IT!
I have never seen such a clean and clear copy. I have around 55 Code Red Blu-Rays right now, and I had been buying from Code Red religiously prior to the announcement of this release. When I found out Bill was releasing Being Different, I was totally shocked.
Not only is the picture perfect, but it's also Widescreen (1.66:1). Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think a widescreen copy of this film existed. When I was a kid, I had no idea what widescreen was, and shortly after films were being released on DVD in widescreen, I started hating widescreen. Now I love it since I understand what it is and why it's necessary.
This Blu-Ray is essential for fans of this film. It's the definitive release.
It also has and interview with the producer Robert Kline, and the original trailer.
I added a few screenshots of the new transfer so people can see how excellent it looks.
I highly, highly recommend it. Buy this immediately!",1500768000,2,2041,4.290155440414508
7820096,5,6302034671,Love this stuff... thanks to Code Red for taking the time to clean this up and give it a proper release. They always do an awesome job at digging these obscure titles out and putting them back into the hands of collections. I'm really looking forward to their Screams of a Winter Night release. I recommend Being Different to anyone who is a fan of Tod Browning's Freaks.,1498953600,,371,4.470588235294118
7820097,5,6302034671,"Code Red Blu Ray - of Being Different (1981), looks better than ever in WS.  Candid and somewhat exploitative.",1495929600,2,110,4.7894736842105265
7820098,4,6302034671,"I found this movie for sale at a local going out of business sale and to my suprise it was pretty good. It is not just an exploitation movie it is an informative documentary, although only good for about one watch, it tells the story of the people behind the freaks ( so to speak) and how they got to where they are today. I don't know how significant this video actually is, but it does go to show that just because people are different does not mean they are not ""normal"". IF you can get your hands on this video it is definitely worth the watch, but good luck because it has long been out of print and very hard to come by. VIVA LA FREAKS!!!",1093132800,6,644,4.078740157480315
