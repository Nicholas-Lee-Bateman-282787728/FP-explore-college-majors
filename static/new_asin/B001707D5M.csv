8264313,4,B001707D5M,"I'm pleased to have this DVD, even though it is rather short at 25 minutes.  This is the best interview I've seen on David and most of it is in close-up form which is nice.  I also enjoyed the concert footage clips I hadn't seen before. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is OK.  As its not easy for me to collect much on David these days due to half his music being download only and his books scarce, this is a valid item to own on him but I wish the interview had been longer.  I would recommend this for any new fans of his who want to collect him.",1357862400,,564,3.9646017699115044
