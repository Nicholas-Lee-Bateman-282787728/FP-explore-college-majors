7793656,5,0962718564,Larry Payne is an excellent instructor.  The relaxing manner in which he speaks brings inner peace.  I particularly find his simple instructions helpful as well as his reminders to breathe.  He demonstrates everything in an easy way and it's the only yoga dvd you'll need.  The stretching is excellent after my workout.  MOST important is one can choose between the short program and the longer program.,1452211200,3,403,5.045454545454546
7793657,3,0962718564,It's a very basic video for those that want to try yoga to see if they like it first.  I liked it but I prefer something a bit more challenging.,1422403200,,144,3.8
7793658,5,0962718564,"Gave this to my boyfriend as a gift and we have done it a few times together.  This is a very basic DVD -- so if you have never done any yoga, this is a great way to see if you like it.  If you do like Yoga, you will need to get a next level up.",1421452800,,245,3.280701754385965
7793659,1,0962718564,"When I played the DVD I found it contained only around 5 super simple poses on it which was disappointing. Worse than that is it is broken down into 1/2 program or full program giving you a choice of length of workout but both program are exact duplicates of each other. Its like they copied the 1/2 program over to the full program right down to the introduction of the DVD. Same introduction, same 5 poses, totally IDENTICAL. It makes no sense. If I wanted to do the same exact beginner poses again and listen to the same introduction I could just start the DVD over as opposed to selecting full program. For the money this DVD costs it is a joke. Don't waste your money!",1396483200,3,673,4.349206349206349
7793660,3,0962718564,"If you are just starting out, this is a good beginning.  I like the options of the two programs.  Relaxing.",1389830400,,107,4.3
7793661,5,0962718564,"I've taken a lot of yoga classes over the years and bought a lot of yoga DVD's along the way too.

Larry Payne's Prime of Life Yoga Series is THE best I've ever tried.

The Upper Back and Neck Problems DVD is one I've recommended to friends and they've been happy that I did.

The Beginner's DVD is perfect for anyone who has never practised yoga before or who is getting back to yoga after an extended break.

 I now use the Immune Booster Level One on an almost daily basis and love it. After a break from practising yoga on  a regular basis, this was a wonderful way to ease back into my practise. After only a few weeks, I have regained the ""ground"" I lost and have started to progress again too.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

7793662,4,0962718564,very basic poses very basic yoga routine not much on the art of breathing and how it works with yoga poses,1360195200,3,106,4.095238095238095
7793663,5,0962718564,I have many Yoga videos by different instructors but since purchasing this video I have no desire to use the others.  I find Larry Payne undoubtedly the best teacher.  His instructions are told simply in a relaxing voice and  the dynamic and static way of doing the poses is excellent. I also love the  fact that there is no time wasted at the beginning of the video waiting for  adverts to come to an end - Larry Payne goes straight to work.  I have  purchased his other Yoga video 'Yoga for a User Friendly Back'which is also  excellent.  Please Larry hurry up and get another Yoga video recorded.,961286400,16,599,4.472222222222222
