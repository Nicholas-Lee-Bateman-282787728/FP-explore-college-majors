8226082,5,B000WYGE68,"I wish more film makers could make genuine films and documentaries
about ET's as this guy did.  Good music, has a real feel to it, and even
seems genuine in truths.  This spiritual modern day hippie seems to have
great connections with ET's and has made contact.  It makes you wish we
all have the same experiences.  Perhaps the reason why this guy manages
to connect so well, is because he's honest and open minded.  Whereas most
people are either scared, angry, or agressive.  The lectures in the documentary
can be a little slow and drawn out.  But if you can get through them, it's worth
a look if you like UFO's and ET's.",1366156800,8,626,4.43859649122807
8226083,5,B000WYGE68,"An expert in filming extra terrestrial encounters, James Gilliland shows the reader his discovery and findings in E.T. phenomena. He filmed UFO activity, along with global earth change. The journey in Exploring of what is unknown to most is simply Amazing and Breathtaking.  His Fascinating findings raise many questions to the curious mind. Very Interesting and Enjoyable. Highly Recommended!",1341532800,3,393,5.661016949152542
8226084,5,B000WYGE68,"I received the DVD on time and in excellent condition.  This DVD is extremely informative and wished more people would request it. I feel this DVD is needed for information.  Now is time to find out more about our friends (Masters and ET's) who have been helping Gaia (earth) in becoming more aware of their presence. Seek and ye shall find.

8226085,1,B000WYGE68,"This Gilliland guy is nothing more than a ""New Age"" nut - - and his assemblege of other New Age freaks who come to a conference at his house, and explain how life began on earth from ET's - - and blah-blah-blah !  I respect good solid UFO reports and information - - but this was just plain STUPID !  He explains his abduction - - when he was in the bath tub....just so stupid !  He talks to his ET and she explains his former lives....AHAHAHAHA !  No doubt, he was a King in his prior life - - - certainly not a servant, right ?!!",1307059200,2,531,3.9345794392523366
8226086,2,B000WYGE68,"Have been researching UFOs since the fifties, and bought this DVD direct from the source.  Could have saved a lot by buying from Amazon.

This is more of a life story for James Gilliland; I was expecting more discussion on the ""contacts"".  Saw a few bouncing lights and little else.  Most of the claims and statements I had heard before.  Not a bad DVD; just not what I surmised from the title.",1278028800,5,394,4.416666666666667
8226087,5,B000WYGE68,"Excellent, don't really need to say any more than that.
A must have item for anyone who believes.
This is confirmation. Now all we want is disclosure.",1254182400,7,150,4.592592592592593
