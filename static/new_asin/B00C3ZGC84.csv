8577204,4,B00C3ZGC84,"This film is about three brothers whose father is dying. The father has a strange attachment to a cheap digital watch he won at the seaside and after an unfortunate accident the elder son - Noel - decides he has to replace the watch. Problem is he has no way of getting there unless he can `borrow' the bread van that he works on.

Well he is turned down so decides to nick it for the weekend - but he needs the help of eleven year old brother, Paudie and then the younger Scwally finds out and insists on going with them. So off they go for a road trip in a knackered van, with Scwally dressed as a Star Wars character (he is obsessed with the films - but has never seen them) and the more rebellious and challenging Paudie who is a champion `farter' - nice.

This is a gentle tale of brothers growing up and not understanding what each other are going through and also trying to come to terms with the loss of a loved parent. It is not a raucous comedy but there are comedy moments. It is, though, an entertaining drama that got funding from the Irish Film Board and I for one feel it was money well spent.",1401494400,2,1108,4.148837209302326
