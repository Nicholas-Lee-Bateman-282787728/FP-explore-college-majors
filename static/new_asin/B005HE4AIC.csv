4699223,5,B005HE4AIC,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller.

4699225,4,B005HE4AIC,"Ichigo Kurosaki is just your average teenage boy... except that he can see spirits.

So it's not exactly surprising that he gets involved in wild, dangerous adventures, in the first season of the hilarious, action-packed ""Bleach."" It starts off a bit slow, but rapidly winds into a thrilling, expansive adventure story, with lots of big swords, roaring monsters, and TV psychics.

One night a strange girl appears in Ichigo's bedroom, and is shocked when he can see her. She explains that she's a Soul Reaper, who helps the dead pass on to the Soul Society, and destroys evil spirits called Hollows.

But when Rukia is injured in a fight with a Hollow, all her powers are transferred to Ichigo -- and with them, the responsibility of killing Hollows. Ichigo soon finds out that it isn't easy juggling his new responsibilities with his normal, everyday life -- especially since the powerless Rukia is now attending his school, and living in his closet.

Even more distressing, his new powers are attracting all sorts of trouble: the Hollow who murdered his mother, the now-monstrous brother of his ditzy friend Orihime, an outspoken ""mod-soul,"" and classmate Uryu-- the last of the Quincys, sworn enemies of Soul Reapers. Moreover, Orihime and the gentle giant Chad start developing spiritual powers of their own.

But then two powerful Soul Reapers show up to arrest Rukia. Ichigo is left mortally wounded and robbed of his powers, while Rukia is taken back to the Soul Society to be executed. To rescue Rukia, Ichigo agrees to undergo a terribly training regimen that could leave him worse than dead... and the journey into the Soul Society may be even worse...

Most long-running series run out their welcome pretty quickly, or start following a formula. But ""Bleach"" has that magical mix of complex plot, kinetic action, likable characters and kooky comedy. Not only does it click, but the results are sort of a mad hybrid of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" and ""Inuyasha."" Its biggest problem? The first season ends with a cliffhanger the size of the Grand Canyon.

To keep us entertained, there's lots of action, monsters, blood, giant magical swords, spirit arrows and even a skyscraper-sized Hollow. But the writers keep an eye on the characters, and the first arc is used to establish them -- we get to see their pasts, their motivations, and why they want to fight Hollows. Even if it's simply a desire to do what's right and protect others.

And just as important important -- comedy. Every episode of ""Bleach"" has some comedy, whether it's crazy friends and/or relatives, TV appearances, or the wacky dialogue (""OH NO! I'M FRIENDS WITH A NERD! Maybe you need some thick nerd glasses...""). Even Ichigo produces some hilarious moments, such as his bloodcurdling scream when he wakes in Urahara's house.

Ichigo himself is the pivot of the whole series -- like many a good anime hero, he is rough, brash, sensitive and fights for those he loves. And though he's incredibly powerful, he still has a lot of training, fighting and learning to do, though he tends to jump in without thinking about it.

And he's backed by a colourful squad of characters: the prickly Uryu, quiet Chad, ditzy love interest Orihime, and the mysterious ""Mr. Hat and Clogs"" who trains Ichigo to be a full-fledged Soul Reaper. Not to mention Kon, a living lion doll who provides plenty of comic relief, whether he's getting bounced around the room or dressed as Marie Antoinette.

""Bleach's"" first season introduces viewers to a brilliant series, full of hilarity, tears, blood and big, bad monsters. Definitely a must-see, for anyone who likes any of the above.",1350950400,12,3628,4.911764705882353

4699232,5,B005HE4AIC,"I am 46 and have been reading Marvel comics for over 25 years and never thought I would understand let alone enjoy my daughter's manga or anime, as I know almost nothing about Japan or their culture nor did I think I would ""get"" something my teenager found so engaging. My daughter had been trying to get me interested for years. Now she is graduating soon & starting college in August. As most parents can attest, it's hard to relate to your child if you have nothing in common and for the past couple of years there hasn't been much communication. I finally got a break in my work schedule so I decided to let her show me her choice of anime. We watched the first season of Blue Exorcist and the first 3 seasons of Bleach in Japanese with subtitles so far. I would also highly recommend both of these amine but only in the Japanese format with subtitles. We made the mistake of ordering the next season in the English dubbed version and it was horrific in that the voice actors do not match the characters personalities & you just lose a lot in the English-speaking dubbed version as a previous commenter said including the comedic timing and so much more. The (what sounds like American) version just makes everything unfunny and ridiculous and they just don't capture the true essence of the story. The Japanese version is far superior, really engaging and funny and ironic and just more genuine and I agree that it is so very accessible to anyone who can read. (For anyone interested in how appropriate this is for small children, there is quite a bit of bloody fighting and a very small amount of innuendo but nothing in the way of actually sexually explicit content, not even any real kissing, and only a few curse words that aren't shown in the subtitles, I only knew it was a curse word because my daughter read the manga before watching the anime and told me what the Japanese word meant) Also, in just a few short seasons I have started picking up some of the Japanese language and rely less on the subtitles. My daughter has been reading mangas and watching anime for about 5 years and has learned a tremendous amount of Japanese, not just the ability to understand the spoken words but also remembers how to speak the language and a great deal about the culture, all without setting foot out of a rural south setting. In addition, now my daughter and I actually have something to do together and talk about and she is voluntarily wanting to hang out with her old mom. This alone is priceless. But the story is what really got me. I highly recommend the Japanese version of Bleach, you will not regret it. The story and artwork/animation is original and fantastic and actually improves through the seasons. Please do yourself a favor and find a way to watch this. It is amazing! I promise.",1489968000,,2801,4.5266272189349115

4699259,5,B005HE4AIC,"If you're on the fence about watching Bleach for the first time, definitely check it out. I recently watched the first two box sets and I'm dying for more! I will say that it's best to be patient, as it takes a few episodes to really get going, but it's worth it to stick it out. All the characters are unique, the story is compelling, the comedy is a good time, and the dub is pretty solid. If you are considering getting into the series, definitely make the purchase.

Just FYI, from one Bleach noob to another, if you buy box 1, you might as well buy the next two box sets as well. I made the mistake of only getting 1 & 2, and although the second set's last episode didn't leave me TOO hanging, it's best to just buy all of them at once to avoid getting infuriated by any lack of closure. Box Set 4a & 4b are a filler arc, so I'm assuming Set 3 wraps up pretty neatly, so just keep that in mind.",1454371200,12,899,4.022346368715084

4699271,5,B005HE4AIC,"Bleach is one the best Action Animes to date. The story,characters,and basically everything is great. Bleach is one of the best animes to date. With over 300 episodes,this is one good Anime with a awesome plot.

The Anime starts of with a 15 year old boy named Ichigo. He has the power to see Hollows. He comes across one,that hurts his family. A soul reeper,comes and saves Ichigo. Her name is Rukia. She gets hurt and gives him her power. Ichigo turns into a substitute Soul Reeper. The two team up and fight Hollows in Ichigos town. But,some other things happen. But what is it? You'll find out:).

There is plenty of Action in this Anime. Tons of fights makes it more fun. There is also blood,but it's not to bad. There are some very funny,strange,yet stupid times in this Anime. But,it's humor. For a Action Anime,it's quite amusing.

For one thing,it's very long. 369 episodes in the Sub. Some animes don't even reach 20 episodes!!!! 366 in the Dub. It will take awhile to finish,but it's worth it. Even through I never finished it,It's still cool. I have never seen any other Animes except pokemon,Naruto Shuppiun,One Piece,and Sailor Moon that had reached over 300 episodes. Bleach is one of them.

I highly recommend this Anime. StoryLine 9/10 Animation 8/10 SoundTrack 6/10 Overall 9.5/10. For a Anime over 10 years old,it still is a great anime that can always be at least number 5. Bleach is rocks!!!!",1437955200,,1413,4.708502024291498

The writing, while not always the most sophisticated, is solid, and even has some really nice moments here and there. Characters are also well done for the most part.",1429228800,,516,4.681318681318682
4699291,4,B005HE4AIC,"Ichigo Kurosaki is a 15 year old high school student with the ability to see, hear, talk, and touch spirits. While sitting in his room, a spirit of a samurai girl enters. Ichigo reveals that she's actually visible to him, and the girl named Rukia Kuchiki explains her identity and purpose. Rukia is a Soul Reaper, which are a group of spiritual samurai's from The Soul Society whose mission is to help wandering souls pass on. These wandering and harmless souls are called Wholes. However, another being of souls exist called Hollows. These are evil spirits with an endless hunger to devour souls and can even kill the living. The devoured souls eventually becomes Hollows themselves.

After a battle with a Hollow, Rukia is wounded protecting Ichigo. Unable to continue battle, she lends Ichigo her powers, thus turning him into a substitute Soul Reaper armed with an over-sized sword. After the battle, Ichigo must continue her mission to help all souls pass on plus defend the world from the Hollows.-summary

Bleach: The Substitute is the first of three continuing arcs in this portion of the series. Bleach is another one of those long running action series that are in large supply these days. It borrows heavily from series before it: such as Yu Yu Hakusho and Dragonball Z. Like DBZ especially, Bleach is a few seasons too long, but this first story arc along with the next two arcs does a pretty good to decent job delivering the story.

I like the premise of Bleach, even though the whole spirit world story has been done before in Yu Yu Hakusho. I think it's done a little better here. The origin of the Hollows and how they constantly spread are very interesting yet creepy as well. The Hollows are very crafty and formidable opponents. Some of the stories in the first arc are very good displaying their cruel nature. Many fans of the series that I know acknowledge this chapter as one of the best and most engaging in the storyline.

Unfortunately, the characters aren't as interesting as the Hollows. Ichigo is your average fearless shonen hero whom dives into battle with little to no strategy. You're either going to like him or you're not. The supporting characters are every bit as bland as he is, and they could fit comfortably in other series of its type: such as Darker Than Black, Inu-Yasha, and even Shakugen No Shana, which I'm sure says something about those as well.

Despite the characters uninteresting personalities Bleach works in other areas. Some of the comedy is okay to me, especially, the interactions between Ichigo and his father. The story moves at a pretty good pace and some background is given that moves the plot along. Other events begin to take place and later a twist is added to increase the suspense.

The animation is pretty good during the battles and gets better later on in the series. The scenes do not consist of the re-used cel format, but I won't say that the choreography is good, it's about as decent as one would expect from these shonen series. The artwork is nice, and the Hollows are the showstealers with some of their creative and creepy designs. Another area the series shines very bright in is in its soundtrack. Bleach is no slouch in the music department, but most Shonen Jump anime is packaged with a solid music score anyway. The opening rock song Asterisk, which is performed by Orange Range has a catchy sound with the lyrics to go with it. The BGM has a nice feel to it as well. It does enhance some of the action scenes a good deal, while at other times it can set the right mood during quite moments as well as during comedic segments; but it can use a bit of variety though, because the songs lose some of their appeal later on due to over exposure.

I have no complaints with the voice acting. I prefer the English language the best, because I find the dialogue a bit more entertaining. The series does contain a very small amount of foul language. The fight scenes can be pretty bloody but nothing too graphic in my view. Outside of maybe one bouncy character, the fan service is practically non existent.

In closing, Bleach is excellent for those whom consider Dragon Ball Z,  Inu-Yasha, and Naruto to be great anime. This is the type of series I can only get into when I want something simple, especially since I've binged on numerous series not of this breed. If you find yourself hooked on this first chapter, then immediately pick up the following two arcs: Bleach: The Entry and Bleach: The Rescue. This chapter is 20 episodes with a 500 minute length.

Pros: Very good opening song and BGM, lots of action, interesting beginning

Cons: Derivative of many shonen series before it, very bland supporting characters",1428105600,,4698,4.682424242424243

4699313,5,B005HE4AIC,Like most American live action and animated series this show has a slow begining yet picks up the pace and gets good at episode three and beyond. Like most reviewers say the price is expensive. I hope the complete series comes to America with this start and movies as well to be considered a complete series at a price of no more than $104 dollars due to not having funds to buy such an excellent series. If bought seperate sets and movies the price is almost $2000 which is to much for a series that is intelligent and funny at the same time and unedited due to America being to conservitive for excellent stories that requier some violence and language as it is part of the story.,1426291200,,682,4.377952755905512

4699350,5,B005HE4AIC,"I Love Bleach, I started watching around Episode 87 or so I had no clue what was going on, but it looked very cool so (at that time I read Shonen Jump but never bothered to read manga I didn't know) I continued watching it on adult Swim (before it was on Toonami) and before long I was in Love with the show, I love the characters, the Background music, the Voice actors they've chosen, the sense of humor (its pretty hard translate joke from the Japanese Ver.), and lastly the story, it the most well thought out story I've ever seen/heared in my life, overall I highly recommend this show for any one who love anime and who is kinda tired of slow action and too much talking.",1396137600,2,677,4.255813953488372
4699351,5,B005HE4AIC,"Bleach, for those who don't know, is a Japanese Manga series created by Tite Kubo. It's been ,and still is, running weekly in Shonen Jump Weekly Magazine since 2001. This is the first season of the anime adaption of Bleach and boy is it a great season. It follows 15 year old Ichigo Kurosaki, a teen that has been able to clearly see and interact with ghosts his entire life. His world get even more strange though when a Soul Reaper( death god or grim reaper type spirit) named Rukia Kuchiki shows up to battle evil spirits called hollows. These monsters eat souls and are attracted to people and spirits with high spiritual energy like Ichigo. After a crash course about Soul Reapers from Rukia,  one of these hollows attacks Ichigo's family and during the battle to protect Ichigo and his family, Rukia is injured and can't fight back. She gives him her Soul Reaper powers to kill the hollow and he has to take on the job of the Substitute Soul Reaper till her powers return. Wielding an enormous sword called a Zanpakuto, Ichigo with Rukia's has to protect his city of Karakura Japan from hollows and learn  all about Soul Reapers and their jobs of crossing over souls t othe Soul Socetiy and killing hollows.

The first season, which is made up of 20 episodes, shows Ichigo dealing with being a Soul Reaper, battling powerful hollows, protecting souls( and crossing them over) and trying to live a normal life with his friends and family.

Now then..

The animation and characters designs are decent though not as good as in later seasons because it's only the fist season and the animators haven't gotten comfortable with the characters yet. There's a bit too much brightness to the animation and colors at times that's a little strange, but it's till fairly solid overall.

The English voice acting is decent and like the animation, gets better as the series goes on and the voice actors/ voice actresses get more comfortable with their roles. All the voice actors/ actresses really fit their characters well, and after only a short while you can't imagine anyone else doing the voices.

The opening theme and 2 closing themes is quite good, though later ones are better in my opinion. They're catchy and fit the series well.

The story is the part most will focus on and quite so.. It's a unique and really well done story and the season 1 arc story line is quite a good for an intro to the 16 season, 366 episode long series. You do need to pay attention though as a lot of terminology get's introduced and use quite often, but fortunately it's all explained in great detail so by the end of season 1 you'll know what  terms like Zanpakuto, Konso, Hollow, Soul Reaper, Kido and much more.. which is good because you'll need this info for the other seasons since they don't really explain things more then once usually.

 Another good part about the story is how developed the characters get.. almost all of them get more developed as the series goes on and it's nice to see even minor characters get detailed back stories over time.

As good as Bleach is, there are some annoying parts to the series..for one thing, we have the character of Orihime Inoue.. she's way to stereotypical.  useless,dense, air headed, overly friendly, has crush on main character that only main character is oblivious to, and of course she has enormous breasts which seem to get bigger as the series goes on... she was rather normal sized in the original manga but get's ""upgraded"" for the anime to appeal to guys.. it's not appealing to this guy though.. it's too cliche. she looks like she shoved cantaloupes down her shirt by the final season.. it's not appealing.. but at least the sex jokes of the series isn't as numerous as some anime are.

Another minor complaint is that Ichigo is too much like other typical overly powerful shonen character. He has a few close calls, particularly with one brutal fight at the grave yard and the equally brutal last battle of the season which is against Rukia's older brother Byakuya and her childhood friend Renji. Ichigo of course survives but outside of that he's always the strongest character and doesn't loose much in season 1.. he's a bit too powerful at times I think is the problem, but it's not a huge one or anything and the series is still really good.. the best anime ever in my opinion.

+Decent animation
+Good character designs
+Good first season arc
+Interesting series premise
+Interesting and well developed characters
+God voice actors/actresses
+decent extra included on disc 5

-Orihime is somewhat annoying at times
-voice role are a little rough at first
-Animation can be a little rough at times

Overall,  it's a great anime series and a good first season.",1395273600,,4712,4.6909090909090905

This box set is absolutely amazing and anyone who wishes to collect the anime should do it on Amazon because the prices are cheaper than anywhere else and you can get them in 2 or so days. As for Bleach itself, anyone who is interested in this series should definitely take if for a whirl.
