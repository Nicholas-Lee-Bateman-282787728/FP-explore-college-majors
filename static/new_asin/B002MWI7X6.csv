8374129,4,B002MWI7X6,"""Ghosts"" (2005 release from Germany; 85 min.; original title ""Gespenster"" a/k/a ""Ghost, not in plural) brings the story of Nina (played by Julia Hummer), a teenager whom we first meet when she is doing community work in a park in Berlin. Nina happens to meet Toni (played by Sabine Timoteo), a twenty-something woman who is a drifter. Nina wants to help her in any way she possibly can (which is not much). In a parallel story line, we get to know a French couple, the wife of which seems a very troubled woman who is looking for a young lady whom she thinks is her long-lost daughter. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is written and directed by Christian Petzold, one of Europe's top directors in my humble opinion. Some of his other works include 2000's ""The State I'm In"" (also starring Julia Hummer), 2007's ""Yella"" and the excellent political thriller ""Barbara"" from 2012. I'll go see anything from this guy. Second, even though Amazon lists this as a 2009 release, it really was released in 2005. Third as already mentioned, Julia Hummer reappears in a Petzold film. Here she is pushing her age limit (she is 25 in real life, playing a 16 or 17 yr old), but it doesn't take away from the immense talent that she is. (She would appear also in Petzold's ""Carlos"" TV mini-series.) Fourth, the movie does a great job setting up the various characters, and is not afraid to let you wonder for quite some time as to how all the pieces fit together. A movie that challenges the mind, what a concept! Iron Man 3 this ain't. At just 85 min., this movie flew by in no time and at the end of it I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters. What better compliment can you give a movie?

Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that challenges your mind and lets you do some of the mental work yourself, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Ghosts"" is another great film from German director Christian Petzold that begs to be seen. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1395100800,3,2080,4.5
8374130,4,B002MWI7X6,"German director Christian Petzold brings to the screen another set of his characters destined to connect only temporarily if at all with each other and only incidentally with the audience. A teenage girl (Julia Hummer) on the drift between foster homes befriends a twenty-something vagabond (Sabine Timoteo) of no apparent address, who gets into scrapes with strange men in the park and seems to live on handouts, shoplifting and whatever she can steal. The friendship blossoms into a kind of romance, while a woman guest at the Berlin Marriott, outfitted in Prada (Marianne Basler), comes to believe that the teenager is her daughter who disappeared 15 years ago outside a supermarket. Like the more recent film ""Jerichow,"" there develops a degree of rough tension between the three central characters, which is resolved in a way not happily for any of them.

The ""Ghosts"" (""Gespenter"") of the title refers to a series of computerized image projections based on a baby photo of what a grown child could look like. All the characters we meet (there are others) are in some way ghosts of the fully realized people they might be were they somehow not users of other people, liars, thieves, manipulators, voyeurs, emotionally crippled, passive aggressive, or simply passive. Petzold's portrayals of the life he sees being lived are hardly reassuring. As social animals, his characters can be more animal than social, and the city they prowl through is lifeless and often colorless. A wash of rich color makes a stark contrast in what is supposed to be a party scene, but it's not a party where anyone seems to be having any fun.

This is not a film for everyone, but if you like a story that unfolds slowly and deliberately, with unexpected turns that reveal character and their motivations like pieces of a puzzle, Petzold does not disappoint. The DVD includes a making of documentary in which you get to see him at work.",1271980800,7,1919,4.901538461538461
