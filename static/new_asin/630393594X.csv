Episode Seven: Dragon, The Ninja Monster. Guillotine's gargantuan lizard-like monster crushes an experimental warplane from one nation and scoops up a top-secret submarine from its opponent. Each nation blames the other, and a world war ensues. The Unicorns call a peace conference, where a Gargoyle spy sneaks in with a time bomb. Johnny Sokki unravels the ploy just in time, and calls for Giant Robot's help. Suddenly, Dragon, the Ninja Monster re-appears ready for battle! It's a fist-flying karatefest of machine versus monster -- but Giant Robot triumphs by flinging the monster into the sea. When the missing plane and sub float up from the beast's watery grave, suspicions are laid to rest. The world is at peace again!

Episode Eight: The Gigantic Claw. Tests are complete. Not only is the new QQV metal the most durable substance on earth, it's completely transparent. The Defense Ministry decides to entrust its specifications to the United Nations in New York. But Emperor Guillotine envisions fleets of invisible bombers and crystalline ships, and he'll do anything to get his hands on the secret formula! The Gargoyles launch their latest weapon to intercept the shipment -- a mega-mean monster claw big enough to put the squeeze on our robot hero! Can Giant Robot escape the clenched fist of doom? You bet! And when he fires up his flame thrower to torch the treacherous talon, all the Unicorns jump for joy!

That's what's on the back of the box. I'm not making this up.",1125619200,,1521,4.980314960629921
