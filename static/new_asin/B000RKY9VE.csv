8201177,2,B000RKY9VE,"The cast of this drama was all actors I had seen in other works, so I was disappointed to discover the plot juvenile, slow & repetitive.  The subtitles caused frustration - too simple & inaccurate.  There was also a problem w/ the 2nd disc being changed out to a random other drama.  The seller was gracious & accepted the return, but there was the cost of handling for both of us &  considerable disillusionment.  I would work w/ this seller again, however for being quick and honest.  I will be careful not to order based on the cast alone and look for more solid reviews first.  Kdramas can break your heart in lots of way, I suppose.  But when you love them, you take risks, eh?",1382313600,,682,4.357142857142857
