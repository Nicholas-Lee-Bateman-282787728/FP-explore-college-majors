8337251,5,B001R3YRJY,"I purchased this program years back in 1992 when it was offered only on VHS.  At that time I was restricted to wearing glasses while driving on my driver's license.  After the fact of having this restriction, I purchased this program and the next time I went in to have my eyes examined for my drivers license the restriction was lifted!  It just doesn't get any better than that.  Since 1991 I have not had to have any correction on my glasses.  My optometrist is amazed and impressed.  One thing though, as with any muscle building program a person will have to go back and repeat the program from time to time to reestablish the eye muscle strength.  cc",1250121600,9,656,4.46218487394958
8337252,5,B001R3YRJY,I originally bought this back in the 90's. It was on 6 VHS tapes and cost over $100. The fact that it's now on DVD for a fraction of the price makes it well worth the investment!,1246147200,7,178,3.8378378378378377
