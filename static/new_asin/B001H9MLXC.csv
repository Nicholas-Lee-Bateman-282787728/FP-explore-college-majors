8308183,1,B001H9MLXC,"This has to be the absolute most boring workout ever. Thank goodness I rented instead of bought. This workout is for someone who has never worked out in their life.... very easy, even if you haven't worked out lately. I would not, not, NOT recommend this to anyone looking to really sweat.",1322611200,,289,4.576923076923077
8308184,5,B001H9MLXC,"Emily Passic guides all levels (beginner through expert) to improve their core strength. After having my first child I had to regain much of my core strength and balance, though I was not a beginner to pilates using a ball, this video helped me do just that.",1306886400,,258,4.51063829787234
8308185,2,B001H9MLXC,"I can't believe this workout got such great reviews. I've been doing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quick-Fix-Stability-Ball-Workout/dp/B001CDFXRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quick Fix: Stability Ball Workout</a>for months and decided to get another workout to add to the mix. I couldn't even make it through the whole workout. Not because it was too hard, but because it was so slow moving. I was bored within the first couple of minutes! Half of the exercises weren't hard at all and the pauses between each set were a bit irritating. There's no music and to be honest it looks like Emily Passic is doing this video as a project for a college class or something. Definitely not professional quality. A total waste of money.",1257206400,,772,5.721739130434782
8308186,5,B001H9MLXC,"This is an excellent Pilates video.  It has been a kind of physical therapy after pregnancy, which has put a lot of strain on my spine.  I feel more energized and I not as hunched over as I used to be.  I would recommend this workout to anyone since it is geared to all levels and Emily Passic does an excellent job of explaining and leading each exercise.",1241395200,,356,4.205882352941177
8308187,5,B001H9MLXC,"I originally started practicing Pilates in hopes of reducing my overall body stiffness from sitting behind a desk all day and to further develop my ""Lower Back"" strength.

I had read about the benefits that Pilates could offer and heard great things about the Stand Tall video.  What I realized after working with her exercises went far beyond my expectations.  I not only significantly increased my strength in core areas but also realized significant change in my body conditioning, balance, flexibility and general wellness. I move better than I did ten years ago and I can really see & feel the difference in everything I do!

Emily Passic has created a video instruction that can be personalized to your specific needs by level of ability and then reinforced by proper technique. She has a natural ability to be motivating and encouraging while at the same time providing clear and focused technical instruction.  The result for me was that in a very short time I saw rapid improvement in body strength and total body flexibility.

My hours with Emily's video have been challenging, energizing, and much more beneficial than any physical therapy that I have had in the past.

Whether you are ""Beginning"", ""Intermediate"" or ""Advanced"", I promise that you will see and feel a difference quickly. I have no doubt that the progress I make will continue as I advance through the Stand Tall Video.",1236556800,,1396,4.914893617021277
8308188,5,B001H9MLXC,"After a 9 to 5 day at work sat in front of a computer, the modern day torture, this Pilates DVD provides an excellent workout to increase general toning and strength, while also releasing body tension for improved posture.
The instructor shows great knowledge of Pilates with a wide range of exercises. She provides very useful and constructive comments to the 'brave!' students which certainly helps you correct your own position at home to maximize the workout.

8308189,5,B001H9MLXC,I highly recommend this DVD.  Emily makes it easy to complete a well rounded core strengthening workout at your own convenience and in a short amount of time.  The Pilates based exercises and stretches are demonstrated in segments so you have time to transition and adjust the number of repetitions.  I use it a couple times a week and I am more aware of my posture and feel myself getting stronger.  She's a great teacher and makes working out feel enjoyable!,1231632000,,460,4.6419753086419755
8308190,5,B001H9MLXC,"First, i have to confess, i don't generally go for these type of exercise video/DVDs, but was very impressed with ""Stand Tall"".  Emily Passic has effectively distilled years of experience as a fitness trainer, massage therapist, Pilates based instructor, nutritionist, etc. into specific exercises that focus on core strengthening, stability, balance and flexibility training. After just one easy-to-follow viewing, I felt much better !  These exercises are designed for busy people who spend too much time at a desk and/or table and have plenty of underused muscles. Emily's compassion and bright spirit helps greatly as well. Definitely recommended.",1231027200,,651,5.63265306122449
