8085193,5,B000BCJ4WM,"This is an outstanding training video and I continue to get more out of it every time I watch it.  Doug uses lymphatic pumping, muscle energy, joint manipulation, myofascial release and nerve manipulation techniques in an integrated way to release trapped and irritated nerves.  There's a lot here to absorb.  Every technique is gentle and non-coercive if done correctly.  I have to say I appreciate Doug's calm delivery and occasional giggle, although background noise is sometimes annoying.  Really helpful video angles, anatomical graphics and animations.",1418515200,,558,5.517647058823529

8085195,3,B000BCJ4WM,"Hmm mixed feelings about this DVD. I have enjoyed others from the same company: Myofascial, Pregnancy, etc..
This one makes use of great graphics in depicting a lot of details along nerve pathways (only the upper extremities folks!). However the presentation and monotone delivery is a little off seeting to my personality (boring). So i digest it in pieces.
As far as the many many techniques it claims to teach, well many are very simple and common sense (atleast to myself) so do not hold your breath on redefining your tool box too greatly. People interested in this type of work and serious about bodywork shoulde definitely look into ART (active release technique)- only problem being that they monopolize their products to seminars and big money investments.  There are some good things in this dvd, you just have to make it thru the slow hum drum presentation.",1203033600,9,868,4.904761904761905
8085196,5,B000BCJ4WM,I just wish nerves were talked about more in the massage field; we mostly concentrate on the muscles and that is just a portion of what we massage. This DVD will help you understand the nervous system and give you many techniques that you can perform on a client. The visual effects are cutting edge technology. This video gave me a whole new outlook on massage and it has changed how I perform my massage treatments. You will never look at another client without thinking about the nervous system.,1177804800,10,498,4.606741573033708
