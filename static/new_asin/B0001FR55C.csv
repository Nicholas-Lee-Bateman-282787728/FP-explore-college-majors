1997263,3,B0001FR55C,"""Call Me Madam"" is a musical that desperately wants you to love it. At times that love is genuine...at other times it seems forced. Ethel Merman stars as ""the hostess with the mostest."" She's bold, gregarious, irrepressible, manic, enigmatic and electrifying - in spots. But 2 hours of Ethel is like 20 minutes in a wind tunnel; it's exhausting! Yes, the Irving Berlin score will have you tapping and humming away with pleasure, and, yes, the supporting cast of Vera Ellen, Donald O'Connor and George Sanders are all welcome additions that compliment the divine Ms. Merman. But they are mere appendages to her performance and are given so little to do that without Ethel there really wouldn't be a show.  That aside, Merman proves why she was such a powerhouse on the live stage. She's like the female Bert Lahr (the cowardly lion from ""The Wizard of Oz"" for those who might otherwise not know to whom I am referring). She bounces from one emotion to the next, manically sucking up the atmosphere and expelling all things Merman in its place. Is she intoxicating? Suffocating is a more accurate assessment, but engaging nonetheless. Just make sure you've had your morning coffee first! Okay, make it two!
TRANSFER: A respectable transfer from Fox. Full frame, as originally seen, with rich, vibrant Technicolor, solid blacks and excellent contrast levels. Digital anomalies are rare, pixelization being of the greatest concern, for a picture that is overall quite smooth and satisfying, if somewhat softly focused from time to time. Age related artifacts are present throughout but they do not distract from your viewing enjoyment. The audio has been remastered to stereo but remains something of a muffled disappointment, particularly in the songs.
EXTRAS:  A wonderful audio commentary and precious little else.
BOTTOM LINE: Tackle the exuberant Ms. Merman...but only if you dare!",1082419200,13,1882,5.107142857142857
1997264,5,B0001FR55C,"I had been looking forward with anticipation for the release of CALL ME MADAM and now it is here. Like many fans of this movie we may wounder why this DVD is in Full Screen Format. Well some investagating on my part found the answer. While Cinamascope was the widescreen format of choice for 20th Centry Fox the stdio that made CALL ME MADAM. it was for some reasion Not shot in WIDESCREEN, in fact it is the last NON-Cinamascope Musical made by FOX n the 50's. The year folling the release of Call Me Madam the studio Released There's No Business Like Show Business, also staring Ms Merman and that was in WideScreen photographed by the same cinamatographer.
But we have this new DVD. It is a good time and is fun and full of energy. And it is one of only two roles Merman had played on Broadway that she was given the opportunity to Play on the screen, the other film is ANYTHING GOES made in the 30's. So if you are a fan then you will want to get this DVD.",1082246400,,960,4.194594594594594
1997265,5,B0001FR55C,"I am SO happy that it is on DVD! I can't wait to get it! This is one of my personal favourite musicals of all time.
There is SO many GREAT songs in this musical! I loved the performances of everyone in it! It's quite rare to have SUCH a perfect cast.. I'm sure you'd all agree when I say that I wouldn't change ANY one cast member.
Although Ethel (God Bless good old Ethel); is the 'main character', Donald O'Conner has probably got the best songs! So he has probably got the best role, although billed second.
One of my favourite scenes is the dance that Vera-Ellen and Donald O'conner do (she wears the most BEAUTIFUL dress!!!) It is a stunning number. Vera-Ellen is just gorgeous.
Another memorable moment is when Ethel's character (Mrs Sally Adams) is presented to 'his highness' at a ball. She walks perfectly to his throne and goes to bow.. then she falls over. It's the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.
If you are thinking of getting this DVD but aren't quite sure, just GET IT! It's a beautiful musical.  Don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it but, I assuse you, you won't be dissapointed! A great family film with lots of comedy, romance and som of the greatest songs of our time!",1080432000,15,1213,4.415178571428571
1997266,5,B0001FR55C,"After too many years locked away in the vaults, the movie version of CALL ME MADAM is finally getting released on DVD.
This is the only time Ethel Merman did a faithful screen re-creation of one of her famous Broadway roles.  Sadly she was passed over for the film of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN when the role was assigned to first to Judy Garland, then to Betty Hutton. And her greatest stage role, Madame Rose, went To Rosalind Russell in the movie of GYPSY.  In an interview with Miss Merman she explained ""the studios, in those days, they wanted picture names..but when they got to CALL ME MADAM I guess they figured they'd take a chance on me.""  Some chance. MADAM had played 644 performances on Broadway and had been acclaimed a big hit.
The story, a lightly satirical look at international politics was inspired by Harry Truman's appointment of Pearl Mesta as Ambassador to Luxembourg.  It was rumoured that Pearl got the assignment by being a great party-giver. So, Howard Lindsay & Russell Crouse created Mrs. Sally Adams, a wealthy Oklahoma widow who gravitates to Washington and thanks to her parties is appointed ambassador to Lichtenburg. The movie retains much of what worked on stage but embellishes it with some additional funny scenes.
Best of all most of the Broadway score is retained: ""The Hostess With the Mostes'""; ""Can You Use Any Money Today""; ""Marrying for Love""; ""It's a Lovely Day Today""; ""Something to Dance About""; ""The Best Thing for You"" and the showstopping ""You're Just in Love."" Added to the movie are two old Berlin standards, ""The International Rag"" and ""What Chance Have I with Love"" which becomes a hilarious dance routine for Donald O'Connor.
O'Connor also gets to dance to ""Something to Dance About"" with Vera Ellen.  Since the two secondary leads were played by dancers, the movie allows them to develop their romance through dance and its an effective change. It also takes some of the emphasis off Merman.
Ethel is still very much the star of the picture.  Belting out the songs and delivering the comic zingers with panache.  It is still a very theatrical performance....you still have the sense she is playing to the back row of the balcony. But that is was Merman was all about, and that is why the film is an important document.
Some of her best lines:
Congressman: When will you arrive at your post?
Sally: I'm not sure. Where the heck is Lichtenburg??
Congressman: Sally, you wouldn't like me to make a little farewell speech tonight?
Sally: That's right. I WOULDN'T!
Grand Duke: Tell me - How does this reception differ from your famous Washington parties?
Sally: Well WE have good time!
And in the best musical comdy tradition, everything works out in time for a happy ending.  Now that CALL ME MADAM is finally getting back into circulation we have a happy ending too!

1997311,5,B0001FR55C,"Legendary singer/actress Ethel Merman and tunesmith Irving Berlin followed one Broadway smash musical (ANNIE GET YOUR GUN) with another, CALL ME MADAM, a 1950 topical satire unusual for Berlin but a role tailor-made for Merman as the warm-hearted ""Mrs. Sally Adams,"" Madame Ambassador to tiny ""Lichtenburg"" in Central Europe.  While loosely based on the real Perle Mesta, President Harry Truman's appointee to Luxembourg, by the time 20th Century-Fox released this charmer in 1953 it had to be set back in 1951 -- by 1953 Dwight Eisenhower had become President, helped in some part by this show's song ""They Like Ike"" that had been adapted into a 1952 campaign jingle!

While that song had to be discarded for the movie, key elements of the show remain intact, most notably the pride of place given to Ethel/Sally as the ""Hostess With the Mostes' On the Ball.""  She is ably assisted by a Lichtenburgian potential lover (George Sanders), a starchy Embassy Charge D'Affaires she nicknames ""Fancy Pants"" (Billy de Wolfe), and the verstatile Donald O'Connor as her press agent, who falls for a reserved but highly danceable Lichtenburgian princess (Vera-Ellen).  Music and colorful dances abound; highlights include the ""Ocarina"" production number and Merman/O'Connor's outstanding duet on ""(You're Not Sick) You're Just In Love.""  I would much rather people see CALL ME MADAM than the following year's THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS, which was even more heavily loaded with name entertainers and Berlin tunes, and released in Fox's new CinemaScope widescreen, but emerged overblown and trite.  While this DVD of CALL ME MADAM goes for a little more than the standard ""Marquee Musical,"" a truly excellent commentary by film historian Miles Krueger helps seal the deal.

The songs, with the exception of 'Marrying for Love' are still terrific, but the plot, and an embarassing musical number called The Ocarina is right out of operetta. Ethel Merman on the screen reveals why she was great on the stage, and Vera-Ellen and Donald O'Conner who were both terrific dancers, did much better work in much better films. But at least they are a good couple. George Sanders seems to be looking for the exit. Or Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ethel Merman needed a comic to play off, and not a traditional leading man, but it never happened. I do worry about the number of people who think this is one for the entire family, though.

Other elements of the film are unintentionally amusing: George Saunders is evidently somewhat uncomfortable at being paired with this powerful woman, and Vera-Ellen's dance performance in what can only be described as an absurd Teutonic fantasy is hilarious if you can keep from feeling sorry for her.

And for me, that's the crux of this musical.  It's Ethel Merman.  It's all about Ethel.  She wails her songs to the balcony and she just isn't the elegant hostess that she's supposed to be.  It's ""Ethel as Mame"" without any of the glorious score and biting wit.  Ethel isn't ""class"" so much as BRASS.

Just all dressed up in Technicolor.

A musical super-duper stage star, a legend at this time in her career, needs a super-duper musical man.  A Gene Kelly.  A Fred Astaire.  Here, she is given the very, very servicable Donald O'Connor.  Sure, he could sing and dance, but Ethel blows him out of the water with her it's-all-about-me-and-to-hell-with-the-rest-of-you high falutin' shenanigans.

1997381,5,B0001FR55C,"This is a film of the highly successful Broadway hit, with songs (tunes and lyrics) by Irving Berlin and starring Ethel Merman on stage and screen. The show opened in October 1950 and ran for over 600 performances, so it was an obvious musical show for Hollywood to turn into a movie, made by 20th Century-Fox and released in 1953.

There was an admirable supporting cast in the film as well as the Berlin score. Merman played an American Ambassadress to the country of Lichtenberg and was partnered romantically by George Sanders as a prominent local general. Sanders proved to have quite a pleasing voice as he sang `Marrying for love' and partnering Merman in `The best thing for you'. Donald O'Connor was a press attach&eacute; to the ambassadress and was given the chance to sing `You're just in love', again partnered by Merman, and soloing on `What chance have I with love?' His dancing is more of the gymnastic Gene Kelly sort than that of the sophisticated Astaire but thoroughly enjoyable to watch. His romantic partner was the `princess' played by Vera Ellen, whose voice was dubbed by Carole Richards in `It's a lovely day today' that she sang with Donald O'Connor, and the duo danced their way through Robert Alton's wonderful choreography. Billy De Wolfe turned in his usual witty performance on the diplomatic staff at the American embassy.

But the star of the show was of course Ethel Merman, who gave her usual powerful solo renditions of `The hostess with the mostest', `International rag' and `Can you use any money today?' as well as overwhelming her partners in the duets.  I'm sure they heard her clearly in Lichtenberg! Oh yes, the plot, such as it was. The tiny country of Lichtenberg was trying to get financial aid from America, but I won't spoil the ending by telling you the result. An enjoyable feast of music and dancing for nearly two hours.",1345075200,,1873,4.7746913580246915

Though my favorite Berlin show is the ill-fated much-maligned and to me at least glorious all-hits ""Mr. President"" - I also love the songs from ""Madam"".  And though she's no longer the kid of ""Anything Goes"", Merman is tops.  I highly recommend this show for Merman and the wonderful songs.  The plot is actually good too.  I am not a fan of Donald O'Connor alas (I have the Merman/Dick Haymes recording of the tunes, and am a fan of Haymes - conscientious objector and all - only in America - or Germany!), but still think it's a great flick.  BTW the recently released TV production of ""Anything Goes"" without seeing it would NOT recommend for two reasons.  First, in a 50s TV production, I'm sure the title song is bowdlerized in the expectable ways (""now heaven knows"" and ""now only use three letter words"" - only in America - or China).  The other reason is Sinatra.  I won't have that guy in the house.  Even Porter, Lahr and Merman can't overcome my two objections.  And those objections must be very strong to overcome those three things!

Perry Como made several 45s from the show, and every house party was filled with the sound of his mellow voice.  I was overjoyed when the DVD FINALLY came out.

1997397,5,B0001FR55C,"Call Me Madam shines bright as one of the finest movie musicals ever made at Twentieth Century-Fox! The cast is superb and the acting is extremely convincing. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the way the songs are sprinkled throughout the picture works wonders for the film. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful and the script was very well written. The quality of the print is very good, too.

When the action begins, we quickly meet one of Washington, D.C.'s wealthiest socialites, Sally Adams (Ethel Merman), as she takes the oath to become the new United States Ambassador to tiny Lichtenburg in Europe. We also meet newly unemployed newspaper reporter Kenneth Gibson (Donald O'Connor) who boldly influences Sally that to be a good Ambassador she'll need a press attach; and that he's the man for the job! Sally doesn't know much about the tiny little kingdom so all it takes is a little maneuvering by Kenneth to let Sally recognize he can be useful to her.

Sally certainly has her hands full when she arrives in Lichtenburg; but between her own determination, self-confidence and with a little help from Kenneth she begins to sail along without major problems. Of course, the plot needs more than just that; Sally meets and falls for Lichtenburg's General Cosmo Constantine (George Sanders). The General falls for Sally, too. Donald also meets someone special; but his case is more complicated: he falls in love with Lichtenburg's Princess Maria (Vera-Ellen) who is unhappy about her arranged marriage to the callous Prince Hugo (Helmut Dantine) but there is nothing she can do about it even as she falls in love with Kenneth.

Meanwhile, Lichtenburg really wanted to manipulate Sally Adams to get a ""loan"" from the United States (one that they'll never have to repay) so that Lichtenburg can pay the dowry to Prince Hugo's family upon the marriage of Prince Hugo to Princess Maria. Although Grand Duke Otto (Ludwig Stssel) and his wife Grand Duchess Sophie (Lilia Skala) and the others in top government assume that Sally will be an easy target for the money, possibly even giving it to them out of her own pocket, they are in for quite a shock as Sally is no so nave!

I'll leave the rest for you to discover and enjoy; I could tell you much more but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that there are plenty of plot twists! It's also true to say that this is Ethel Merman's movie; she carries it brilliantly and her performance is outstanding. Look also for a good performance by Billy De Wolfe as Pemberton Maxwell, a stuffy guy indeed who works at the American Embassy in Lichtenburg.

The DVD comes with a few extras but what you really want is the optional running commentary with Miles Kreuger; the ""teaser"" trailer and the theatrical trailer. The rest are essentially ads for other movies.

Call Me Madam is a wonderful, charming musical. I highly recommend this film for people who like classic movie musicals; and fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections, too.",1263686400,2,3064,4.75
1997398,4,B0001FR55C,"Ethel Merman's greatest triumphs were on the Broadway musical stage, where she starred in such shows as ""Annie Get Your Gun"", ""Something for the Boys"", ""Girl Crazy"", ""Happy Hunting"" and ""Gypsy"".  On the screen, however, Merman wasn't so lucky.  The only stage performance which Merman was granted the opportunity to cement on film was Sally Adams, the Washington hostess with the mostes', in Irving Berlin's CALL ME MADAM.

Assigned to the tiny European duchy of Lichtenburg, Washington society hostess-turned Ambassador Sally Adams (Ethel Merman) is soon up to her neck in romance and mayhem.  The kingdom is broke and needs a loan from the States, but Sally won't be swayed by their overtures...until the handsome Foreign Minister (George Sanders) starts making overtures of his own!  Meanwhile, Sally's assistant Kenneth (Donald O'Connor) literally falls head over heels for the lovely Princess Maria (Vera-Ellen).

Ethel Merman's brash vocal style was best suited to the zippy music of Irving Berlin, and the CALL ME MADAM score was especially-tailored to her unique gifts. ""The Hostess with the Mostess on the Ball"" is a fantastic opener, and things get even better with ""Can You Use Any Money Today?"", ''That International Rag"", and ""You're Just in Love"". Merman doing pensive or romantic ballads was always an uneasy combination, but ""The Best Thing for You"" is actually the one number I adore most in this score.  George Sanders reveals a strong and emotive singing voice in a rare musical role; Vera-Ellen's vocals (for ""The Ocarina"", ""It's a Lovely Day Today"" and ""Something to Dance About"") were dubbed by Carole Richards.

The DVD includes audio commentary with musical theatre historian Miles Krueger, two trailers, plus sneak peeks at other musicals available from Fox (""All That Jazz"", ""The Rose"", ""The Commitments"", ""Star!"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Roxie Hart"").",1256860800,,1877,5.254180602006689
1997399,5,B0001FR55C,"Accept no substitutes---there's only ONE Ethel Merman, and what better way to preserve her unique power and presence than this fine film version of her 1950 stage hit?

And Donald O'Connor's performance is equally fabulous---in fact, the Amazon reviewer who feels that 2 straight hours of Ethel is too much should at least acknowoledge the fact that Donald and Vera Ellen occupy a major amount of screen time on their own. And whereas the performance of Russell Nype in the role of Kenneth Gibson on Broadway created something of a sensation, he was apparently not a dancer; thus the casting of Donald O'Connor in the film version added a whole new musical dimension to the character, while providing us lucky viewers with another prime example of the whimsical charm and dazzling artistry of Mr. O'C.

There's just too much to praise in this wonderful film;  I can only add to the chorus of praise by citing:  the physical beauty of the production, the sumptuous and colorful musical arrangements/orchestrations by the great Alfred Neumann (check the gorgeous opening verse of ""Marrying for Love""), George Sanders' charming and sympathetic performance (who?  George Sanders?!?), in which we have the pleasure of hearing his own mellifluous bass-baritone singing voice (confirmed by theatre historian Miles Kreuger in his excellent commentary), the super-charming ""It's a Lovely Day Today"" scene in the record shop, with clever on-screen plugs for this delightful song between Donald and Vera, Mr. O'Connor playing (and destroying) a giant Marimba with his twinkle toes, etc.... I could go on.

My only complaint is the very static direction in the duets between Ethel and George Sanders. There's only so long they can keep staring at each other adoringly before you want to shout at the screen: ""Move a bit, for Pete's sake!""  The great Berlin tune ""The Best Thing for You"", which I have always felt gets short-changed as the magnificent song that it is, is similarly affected by the blocking. Even the delightful ""Money"" song is sabotaged by this stand-and-deliver approach;  why couldn't Ethel have gone to her desk and started to write a check while singing---something---ANYTHING to give the screen a bit of movement! Then again, the dynamic energy of Ethel Merman just standing and singing at close range is perhaps as much as we should safely expose ourselves to!

In any case, CALL ME MADAM is a delight from beginning to end, and as fine a tribute to the bright, tuneful, fun-filled fifties as you are likely to find.",1253664000,,2526,5.023923444976076

Stage fans complained (as they did later when Audrey Hepburn substituted for Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady), but seeing Merman in Call Me Madam should silence the complainers. She sinks her own film version. Her presence is no more than a gross caricature: vulgar, utterly charmless and crude. Either she refused to accept any direction or the director found it impossible to guide her into giving a performance for film.

On the other hand, seeing Donald O'Connor in this film makes one wish that he had found more musical roles in film and on stage. Vera Ellen dances at the top of her game with her singing dubbed as usual for the terrific Irving Berlin score.",1194912000,2,831,4.770833333333333

Donald O'Connor's partnership with Vera-Ellen is enchanting - I've watched their dances over and over.  And Ethel Merman lights up the screen every time she is on - her interpretation of the memorable Berlin songs, whether belted out or sweetly romantic - is, I believe, unbeatable.

1997421,4,B0001FR55C,"Merman was fortunate in being born during the Golden Age of popular song and she worked with the best composers: Porter, Berlin, Rodgers and Styne. In collaberation with those people she created the leading roles in more classic broadway shows than anybody.  Ethel loved singing and she loved singing for YOU. Her legendary energy and generousity was not limited to the stage.  I have a friend who spent many of his teenage days in New York Hospitals and Ethel could be heard singing throughout the hospital on days when she came to volunteer by entertaining the shutins.  I don't think that ""Call Me Madam"" is as strong a show as ""Annie Get Your Gun"" but since we don't have ""Annie"" on film with Merman this is our chance to see the lady in action.  Subtle she ain't but when you gotta knock 'em dead in the back row, you don't need subtle.  Seeing this gives me another reason to hate Hollywood: 1, Not using Julie Andrews in ""My Fair Lady"" and 2, Not using Ethel Merman in ""Gypsy."" Two incredible opportunities down the drain.

1997423,5,B0001FR55C,"With a larger-than-life personality and a voice that could blow open a barn door at thirty paces, Ethel Merman was among the great stars of Broadway for some thirty years.  Hollywood, however, never quite figured out how to use her talents.  Although she made a number of screen appearances over the years, whenever an Ethel Merman show went to Hollywood, someone else always got the Merman role.  But there is a single exception: the 1953 screen version of CALL ME MADAM.

Although she actually had significant political credentials, Washington hostess Perle Mesta was best known for her parties--and her 1949 appointment as Ambassador to Luxemberg inspired Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse to create CALL ME MADAM.  With Ethel Merman in the leading role and music and lyrics by the legendary Irving Berlin, the show proved a popular ticket in both New York and London.  And surprisingly enough, when 20th Century Fox picked up the film rights, the studio decided to have Merman recreate her Tony-winning performance on screen.

Although Hollywood tweaked both script and score, the screen version is essentially the same show that delighted theatre-goers in the early 1950s.  President Harry S. Truman rewards Washington hostess Sally Adams (Merman) for her support by appointing her Ambassador to a European duchy.  Adams takes Kenneth (Donald O'Connor) along for the ride--and romantic complications with a European dignitary (George Sanders) and a love-lorn princess (Vera-Ellen) have farcial international complications.

CALL ME MADAM is what you might call a ""standard"" musical of the era; although the story references the Cold War and various political issues of the day, it doesn't go serious on you, and while the film is very obviously a take-off on Mesta the political satire involved is light and amusing rather than sharp and meanspirited.  There's no denying that Merman is clearly a performer used to the stage, but she translates to the screen extremely well, and when she opens her mouth to sing you know what all the fuss was about.  O'Connor, Sanders, and Vera-Ellen also fare extremely well, each one charming and playing up to Merman's larger-than-life style.

Although Berlin's score doesn't really compete with his more famous works, it is quite amusing and his lyrics have a satirical edge in keeping with story; ""Hostess With The Mostes',"" ""Can You Use Any Money Today?,"" ""It's A Lovely Day Today,"" and the roundhouse punch Merman-O'Connor duet ""You're Just In Love"" are witty and charming.  And everything about the film sparkles and shines in classic Hollywood musical-comedy fashion.  It's just enchanting, through and through.

Copyright issues kept CALL ME MADAM out of circulation for some twenty years, so any release would have been welcome--but this DVD transfer is quite good, with good sound and brilliant picture and nary a blemish to be found.  The only significant bonus is a commentary by film historian Miles Kreuger, and although it is on the mild side it is quite entertaining as well.  Recommended for fans of the ""old style Hollywood musical""--and Merman fans in particular!

Merman plays the same part of the ambassador that she played in the broadway stage version. She's sent to some small operarettic european county. Merman was never the greatest of actresses so her performance is stagey and should be because that's where all of her experience was. She meets George Sanders who stands tall and handsome and together they're attracted to each other and sing a few songs. Sanders used his own voice and it was quite good. Vera Ellen, who I was never that crazy about, plays a very prim princess betrothed to a prince who'd rather marry someone else. So the princess meets Merman's press agent, Donald O'Connor, and romance blossoms. Ellen never used her own voice as she couldn't sing, but O'Connor could dance circles around some of the best and he could sing too. There's one scene where Ellen and O'Connor dance through an underground wine cellar and it's just as good if not better than you've ever seen with Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly? (How come all the best dancers were always Irish?:)) Merman knocks out a few songs and belts them across the Atlantic.

1997449,5,B0001FR55C,"Sure, this is not the best musical ever, but it deserves to be a classic. Ethel Merman gave a loud and stagey performance that works oddly well in this film, perhaps due to Walter Lang's direction. Her Golden Globe win for this film is more than deserving. ""The King and I"" may be Lang's most acclaimed film, but I think ""Call Me Madam"" is his best work.

This may not be Irvin Berlin's best work, but the score is constantly listenable and the songs are delightful. The witty script alone is enough reason to recommend this film. Adding to the film is the great dancing duets by Vera-Ellen and Donald O'Connor.

Many people rates ""You are just in Love"" as the highlight of the film, but my favourite musical number is ""The Ocarina"", featuring Vera-Ellen in her only dance solo here and an energetic ensemble. Though it is a small-scale performance, the choreography is lovely and the cinematography makes it spectacular to watch.

Another musical number to take note is Donald O'Connor's solo ""What chance Have I"". Though best known for his show-stopping solo ""Make Them Laugh"" in ""Singin' in the Rain"", this number is equally(If not, more) impressive. Wrecking havoc in wine cellar in such an elegant manner, and not to mention his wonderful dancing. I also felt that his best performance was in ""There's No Business Like Show Business"". With that, O'Connor(along with Ethel Merman) is probably one of the most under-rated actors ever to work in Hollywood.

This film also give George Sanders a rare opportunity to play a Mr. Nice Guy, and he is surprisingly just as charming as the boyish O'Connor. I am not too sure if he did is own singing, but either way, it is still good. I highly recommend this musical to any musical lover.",1093132800,6,1733,4.70957095709571
1997450,5,B0001FR55C,"We just finished watching this DVD last night, after holding it back for some months. Glad I waited.

Ethel Merman is filled with joyous energy and vivacity. She isn't overbearing as she was in that later picture she did with Buddy Hackett where all the characters are chasing after money. Probably that picture did more to cement people's minds of one image of Ethel Merman as loud and obnxious. Here she's loud, but only sometimes, she seems like a human being instead of a monster. I love her arm and hand movements when she sings, especially dancing with the two men at the end at her Washington DC party, it's like a penguin dancing.

George Sanders was also very good. Number one, I never heard him act before with that accent (Mitteleuropean Eurotrash) which we heard preserved right into the singing, or whoever dubbed his singing voice for him, though it sounded just like his own voice. Number two, I remember him from REBECCA and ALL ABOUT EVE and dozens of other movies but don't ever remember him playing the leading man or at any rate the ""good guy."" Here he plays General Cosmo Constantine, charming and erudite and kind of sexy, you can see why Sally Adams falls in love with him as soon as he opens his mouth.

This was Donald O'Connor's followup to the famous SINGING IN THE RAIN and his numbers are better than those in SITR, sorry Donen fans but it's true. The one number that he dances to with Vera-Ellen (their first dance, not that underground one) at the reception for Sally Adams, and they sing ""It's a Lovely Day Today,"" is out of this world. And his drunk scene where he dances on a zillion colored balloons is a masterpiece of masculine power and grace. He's also sexy in this! It's a movie where the director took two unlikely actors (Merman and O'Connor) and kind of sexed them up, it's a miracle.

Finally, there's Vera-Ellen in what I believe was her last role. She is lovely and acts the part beautifully. The people I was watching it had never seen her before and found it hard to believe she wasn't herself from Lichtenberg. She wore a bunch of ugly clothes beautifully, and comported herself like a princess, even when wearing that hat in the department store scene that made her hair fall out the back of it. But too thin, and seeing her so emaciated reminded me of her tragic end and made me feel blue.

Can't get the big number out of my head, ""I hear music, and there's no one there,"" mixed with ""You're not sick, you're just in love."" When Donald O'Connor and Ethel Merman sing this, I challenge you to remain in your seats, otherwise you can't help dancing along.

1997452,4,B0001FR55C,"I wish that more movie musicals were done like this...
Okay, okay... I'll be the first to admit: the show is DATED. (In fact, had it not been for Miles Kreuger's commentary, I would NEVER have understood the phonecalls from Harry Truman.)  I am also not a huge fan of the stage score or of Irving Berlin's score (with the exception of a handful of songs).  BUT--I bought this DVD for basically one reason: the presence of the incomparable La Merman.  She is wonderful, and one can only wish after watching this that she had done the film version of GYPSY.
Any way, the film is very faithful to the original, which is admirable for a film musical, ESPECIALLY in that time period. (CHICAGO was particularly good about this, as well.) Pratically all of the songs from the stage score are kept intact -- even the inane ""Dance to the Music of the Ocarina,"" whish is, however, staged as a lovely dance routine.  Insanely, the film cuts ""They Like Ike,"" which was one of the biggest show-stoppers (after ""You're Just in Love"") in the original stage incarnation.
Merman gives a spectacular performance: those big eyes and that BIG voice.  Amazing.  Donald O'Connor is utterly charming, as usual, and finds the perfect foil in Vera-Ellen.  (Kreuger makes a fine point when he discusses why they dance so well together: her ballet-trained movements nicely compliment his vaudevillian-hoofer training.  Just watch and see.)  O'Connor and Merman are great in ""You're Just in Love.""  George Sanders plays a very striking Cosmo, and it is easy to see Merman's attraction to him.  Incidentally, Merman's figure looks GREAT in this film (when you can stand next to super-petite Vera-Ellen and not look huge, that's always a testament to something) and she is always costumed exquisitely by Irene Sharaff.
Kreuger's commentary will not be for everyone, but I myself enjoyed it.  Be forewarned, a good deal of it is focused on the bit players, and is generally a variation on the following: ""The actor in grey on the right is Bilbo Baggins, who appeared in over 500 films with the studio, usually playing a Nazi sergeant or drunken cowboy.  He's most remembered for his cameo in CASABLANCA where he steps on Humphrey Bogart's foot without saying 'excuse me,' etc.""  While this got tedious at times, I appreciated that he was recognizing these vetran actors, who did indeed have a large body of work: however, most just won't care.  He also gives some helpful set up into the story of Perle Mesta and her trip to Luxembourg for President Truman.
Anyway, not a great musical, but watch it for Ethel perfoming the hell out of great songs with a wonderful supporting cast, in a film that should be mimiced closely by those attempting to mave film musicals today.",1090195200,,2740,4.8
1997453,4,B0001FR55C,"The four stars are for the movie, which it's great to have on DVD - Merman given a chance to recreate one of her Broadway triumphs, a witty script, good songs and terrific dancing by Donald O'Connor and Vera-Ellen.  However...as other customers have pointed out, the colour and sound restoration could have been better, plus there is a strange glitch that no-one seems to have noticed - Fox have missed the first two notes of the credit title music!  I compared it to my old VHS to make sure I wasn't imagining things.  All in all, though it is definitely worth buying for the pleasures of the film overall, one hopes that Fox will do it properly at a later date.",1088899200,3,663,4.462809917355372
1997454,5,B0001FR55C,"This is the kind of quality film I'd kept hoping to see Donald O'Connor in after his bravura performance in ""Singin' In The Rain.""  In whatever vehicle Donald appeared, whether it was his movies as a child or teenager, or as an adult, he always shone brightly (""A glittering, glowing star in the cinema firmament,"" to quote Lina Lamont!), even if the material was not top notch -- and unfortunately, much of his material was beneath his great skill.  In ""Singin' in the Rain"" he proved he was worthy of great ""A"" material -- and he proves it again here.  At the risk of gushing too much, a documentary on O'Connor says that his name spelled backwards was Talent!  Amen to that.  Here, he proves it.  One is tempted to irreverantly murmer, ""Fred and Ginger WHO?"" when he and Vera-Ellen dance together.  And O'Connor and Ethel Merman are absolutely wonderful together, too.  The duet they perform, ""You're Just In Love"" is already being worn thin on my DVD from repeated viewing!  Ethel Merman is an acquired taste, usually, but in this film she's just plain fun from beginning to end.  Funny note:  Donald O'Connor had to wear ear plugs during this scene and others with Merman because of her sterophonic lungs!  Great movie, well worth the long wait for its release...don't miss it!",1083542400,5,1282,4.699551569506727
1997455,5,B0001FR55C,"It would indeed have been a nice bonus had this film been produced in CinemaScope, but the studio that first brought that process before the public, Twentieth-Century Fox, hadn't quite readied its first releases in that widescreen process and so ""Call Me Madam"" was given everything but a forty-foot wide screen to dazzle its audiences.  It's a pretty eye-filling spectacle, nevertheless, and the Technicolor used seems to be the original three-strip process which fairly leaps off the screen.  Wider might have been nicer but the film could hardly be better for all of us diehard musical fans!",1082505600,2,594,5.11340206185567
8012018,4,B0001FR55C,"It is not as good as the one I had that stopped working. I was actually disappointed. Yet, I do not wish to give such a good movie less than four stars. If the quality was really good I would have give five stars. It is by far one of my favorite musicals. Donald O'Conner was always one of my favorite people. He was excellent in Singing in the Rain, and just a delight to watch. I saw this movie (Call Me Madam) for the first time when I was twenty-two, and sometimes something I liked then doesn't seem as good now, but not this one. For the first time, I truly appreciated the talent of Ethel Merman. She was fantastic in this, and the gowns were so striking. Vera Ellen is also a great talent. The lyrics to some of the songs are very clever. The story is totally fictional, so brush your imagination and enjoy.",1513468800,2,815,4.197452229299363

8012020,4,B0001FR55C,"I had never heard of this movie until seeing it last week at my father's home. I fell in love with it, and insisted on watching it three times in a row. Is it fabulous? Not quite. Are the Irving Berlin songs topnotch? Not all of them. Is the plot light? Yep. And I love it anyway. It's one of those easy-to-watch, toe-tapping, fun little films that leave you smiling and make your day better. If you're a fan of 1950s clothes--like I am--Ethel's outfits are to die for. And Vera-Ellen's pink gown that she wears while dancing with Donald O'Connor at the palace ball is as breathtaking as the number itself. Donald is a superb dancer with a pleasant singing voice and solid acting ability. I like his dancing style much more than Gene Kelly's. And while I always enjoy movies with George Sanders in them, I am so used to him in sardonic, snide, or villainous roles that his performance as the suave romantic lead Cosmo was a complete--but charming--surprise. Who knew he could sing? As Ethel says so memorably about him . . . WOW! Ethel is a complete delight from start to finish. My favorite musical number is her singing the silly ""International Rag."" And the counterpoint duet she shares with Donald is just . . . wow. The commentary in the special features section is filled with all sorts of interesting trivia and background information. The movie is hard to find, but well worth the search.",1490054400,,1396,4.565737051792829
8012021,5,B0001FR55C,"Donald is adorable, Vera Ellen is charming, and Ethel is loud -- what more can you say?  Not Irving Berlin's best.  Except for the Donald/Ethel duet, ""You're Just In Love"" and some dancing by Donald and Vera Ellen, not much to recommend this.  Good production -- sound and picture are excellent.",1477872000,,295,4.745098039215686
8012022,5,B0001FR55C,"I am beyond pleased with this purchase.  The DVD for all regions was made in South Korea, and I was a bit nervous about buying it.  It not only plays no differently than a DVD manufactured in the USA, but is also of superior quality & cheaper.  I would encourage the production company to distribute other hard-to-find Classic Hollywood titles.",1476662400,3,344,4.7

8012024,4,B0001FR55C,"The 1953 film version of the musical by the same name.  A bit on the stagey side, most scenes are confined to sets that showcase a song or a dance routine.  It feels as boxed in as it looks.  Ethel Merman is a joy to watch, and makes the most of her role.  Billy De Wolfe is wasted as the sneaky charge daffairs Pemberton Maxwell.  Half the time Donald OConnor cant decide whether to wear his spectacles or not.  Vera-Ellen couldn't sing and was dubbed (she did her own dancing though).  George Sanders was an odd choice to play Ethels love interest.  Basically, its all about Ethel and the music, especially the oft-repeated Youre Just in Love.  Any opportunity to see Ethel perform is good one.",1471996800,,696,4.4603174603174605
