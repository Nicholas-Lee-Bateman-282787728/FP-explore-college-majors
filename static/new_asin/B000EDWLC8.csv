Mitch Woods, born in 1951, is an American pianist and singer. Since the early 1980s he has been touring and recording with his band, the Rocket 88s. Woods calls his music, ""rock-a-boogie,"" and with his backing band, he has provided a 1940s-1950s jump blues style. Woods is capable in four styles of piano playing: Chicago blues, Kansas City boogie-woogie, West Coast jump blues and the poly-rhythmic accents of New Orleans. In 2007 Woods was nominated for the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year Award at the Blues Awards in Memphis, Tennessee, presented by the Blues Foundation. Woods has released several albums.

The DVD:
Initially, this DVD left a bad taste in my mouth, as ""Mitch stated that he wasn't going to show us his best tricks"". The negative reviews reflect that others didn't appreciate it either. You do get basic boogie woogie moves, so this DVD is fine for the beginner-intermediate player who doesn't mind a review of the 12-bar blues. The first part of the DVD was pretty boring, but it did get better down the road. There is also a little booklet included in the DVD, something I do not see too often with other music instruction DVDs. I do give  Mitch credit for this. For those that need something more advanced, see my other reviews. I have reviewed nearly 100 boogie woogie books.

Verdict:
Since Mitch is making a living playing this piano style, I understand his decision not to share his signature licks. I appreciate his honesty for being upfront about it.  My advise would be to study the included booklet before you view the DVD, if you decide to buy it.  ;-)",1362873600,2,1606,4.7214285714285715
8108660,1,B000EDWLC8,"I had high hopes for this DVD, being both a fan of Mr. Woods' CDs and an intermediate-advanced pianist.

Unfortunately, this DVD is very basic and introductory- it's for beginners only.
Mr. Woods doesn't share any of his signature right-hand licks, and so, anyone with even a basic knowledge of boogie-woogie is unlikely to learn anything new.

Not recommended.",1296864000,,361,5.101694915254237
8108661,5,B000EDWLC8,"I can't believe all you the people rate this piano lesson so low.  I think it's fantastic.  Mr. Woods gives you a demonstration of many different styles then you use the booklet to learn to play that style.  Honesty, it's the best $15 lesson I ever had and I use it over and over.  If you want to learn boogie, this will get you going; and if you are gonig to get good at it, you will spent a lot of time playing!  I always buy on Amazon and never rate, but because of the other ratings for this item, I didn't want someone who really wants to learn the boogie and who will spend the time on playing each lesson in the book and watch it on the DVD, to overlook what this man has to offer!  There really is something good here!",1220054400,,726,4.006944444444445
8108662,2,B000EDWLC8,"For heart and soul learning to play boogie woogie this DVD has too much commentary that isn't helpful in this directiion. Mr. Woods comes across with an air of quiet, self satisfied arrogance that is off putting - plus a reluctance to his revealing his boogie woogie expertise. A student wants to feel the teacher is enthusiastic about his learning the subject.  That feeling isn't here.

To be fair, Woods does carefully demonstrate a number of left and right hand patterns. And there is a booklet of sheet music enclosed. However, from this reviewer's experience, some of the how-to-teach-yourself blues/boogie woogie books WITH A CD are a better value and more fruitful for the learner.",1212624000,,689,4.982608695652174
8108663,1,B000EDWLC8,"With all due respect Mitch is a quality player but this video does not showcase that in the least.  In fact, the video is a complete waste of time.  99% of the information on here is for complete beginners.  There is very little insight in to what makes this style.  Most of the information is common knowledge for anybody that's even remotely attempted to play blues.  I didn't need a 10 minute conversation in the middle of (60 minutes video) on how a blues progression works.  I would imagine if someone is attempting to play boogie woogie they already know how 12 bars blues is constructed.
  Here is the worst part for me.  I bought this video off of Mitch's site for $35 (with shipping and handling).  It's about $20 cheaper on Amazon.  I was ripped off.  I'm hoping I can prevent others from the same.  Skip this video.",1203638400,5,826,4.4630872483221475
8108664,5,B000EDWLC8,"Mitch Woods has produced an outstanding introduction to boogie woogie piano with this DVD.  He clearly demonstrates the essence of both left and right hand technique.  Additionally, he has included a very handy little booklet of transciption.  This DVD is definitely worth the price for any beginner interested in learning piano boogie woogie.",1159142400,,343,5.433962264150943
8108665,1,B000EDWLC8,"Waste of money, that kind of DVD I could make myself,

and I am only amateur musician. The guy even stated that's not going to show you anything.

I returned it!",1144281600,8,161,4.161290322580645
8108666,1,B000EDWLC8,"I bought Boogie Woogie Piano by Mitch Woods

because there is very little  about this style on the market

but I didn't know Mitch Woods at all.  I wasn't lucky.

Hoping for some good tips and examples, I got  beginner level of samples that kids even would be bored with.

BTW Played not very precisely as somebody would expected.

Also not a one even complete song was presented.

You won't learn anything from that DVD unless you are in kinder garden.

If you want to learn something buy great Dr. John instead.",1142899200,9,513,4.478260869565218
