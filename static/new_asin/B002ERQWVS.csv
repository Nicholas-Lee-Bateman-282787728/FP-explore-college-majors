8368301,5,B002ERQWVS,"Johnny Test is one of the better cartoons to come along in the last decade.  And there's a dearth of good cartoons that aren't just for little kids.  (I hate the dumbed down stuff, it is unwatchable)

But we're being ripped off by Warner Brothers on these DVDs.

They only hold 6 ""stories"" which is 3 episodes.  Johnny Test ran for 3 seasons of 13 episodes, so it will take us forever to get a complete set.

But wait, there's more.  In the UK, they've already released the complete first season, or 13 episodes (26 ""stories"").  This is more than they've released in the US!!

You can't play that on a US DVD player, you'd have to have one of those special DVD players that plays all ""regions"".

Those crooked corporations did the same thing to Jane and the Dragon.  They can get an entire set Down Under, but not here.

I hate big corporations when they do this.  Amazon should use their buying power to beat up these corporations until they scream uncle.

I want a complete Johnny Test box set and I'm willing to pay for it.",1266192000,5,1026,4.35978835978836
