8432972,5,B004KIYFZ4,"This is a very enjoyable series with lots of funny scenes and good story line. I'm a fan of Lee Da Hae after seeing her in MY GIRL. She is just as wonderful in this drama playing a sweet, naive traditional girl trying to save her inheritance.  The English subtitling was OK.  There were a few grammatical and spelling errors but it was  understandable for a non-Korean like me. I've had other K-drama DVDs that had horrendous subtitles that were totally gibberish. If you like light-hearted, fun, romantic comedy, you'll enjoy this one.  It's one of my favorites and one that I will watch again and again like MY GIRL.",1348012800,3,618,4.590909090909091
