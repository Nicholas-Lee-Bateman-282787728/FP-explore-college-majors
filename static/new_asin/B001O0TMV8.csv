8328665,5,B001O0TMV8,"I bought this boxset for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!! We had a
lot of these episodes on vhs and it's so nice to now have them on dvd. I was a
little dissapointed in the discription given because it didn't say what episodes
were included so I decided to write one of my own. All the episode in this set are
the original episodes and not new new cgi episodes. Each disc is
indivisually wrapped. It includes 10 dvds and they all have fun extras! There are a
couple of episodes that are doubles but my son enjoys watching them over and
over again so I didn't see this as a bad thing. Below is a list of the discs included
and the episodes on each disc. If your child is a Thomas and Friends fan like
mine then this is a great box set and I would recommend it for everyone!!
