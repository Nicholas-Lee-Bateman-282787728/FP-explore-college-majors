7870076,5,6304279507,The disc is in perfect condition and plays amazingly.  My daughter loves it and watches it over and over again.,1389398400,,111,4.55
7870077,4,6304279507,"I bought this when my two year old told her first outright lie after asking her if she had done something. She is now three years old and still loves watching this DVD from time to time. There is a story line of the boy who cried wolf and a kid lying about what his Dad does for a living to impress his friends. Of course this won't prevent your kids from lying or make them immediately want to stop, but it does make talking about the subject of lying easier. It gives you common terminology to use from the DVD that they will understand, and you can ask them ""are you telling the truth"" and they know what you mean because the show explains it in a storybook type way.",1386115200,2,670,4.122137404580153
7870078,5,6304279507,great story and perfect way to help teach your kids about lying. A must have for your collection!!! My five year old loves this story and has seen it many times.,1325808000,,161,4.225806451612903
7870079,5,6304279507,"My 22 month old is an Elmophile. I was reluctant to buy this one because while she loves Elmo's World and Elmo's Potty Time, she will not watch the chaors that is Elmo's Guess that Shape. Anyway, we tried it and she watched intently. For some reason, she is terrified of Dennis Quaid in his jumpsuit in the air. It doesn't make common sense to her, maybe? Who knows. Still gets 5 stars because she loves it up to that point. I personally think it's a 4 star, but...",1178928000,,465,4.235955056179775
7870080,5,6304279507,I rented this DVD from the library for my two year old son so many times that I decided to buy it.  He watches this DVD everyday and I enjoy watching it too.  It's not only funny but it teaches the valuable lesson on telling the truth in a way kids can really understand.,1163376000,,271,4.0
7870081,5,6304279507,"This movie is hilarious-a fun one to watch with your kids.  Centers around the day care center where the buzz is all about going to the circus.  Telly feels left out that he didn't go, and thinks in order to be someone you have to go to the circus.  He ends up telling everyone that his uncle Tommy is a ringmaster in the circus.  Meanwhile, Gina reads a story about the boy who cried wolf, and Elmo dreams that he is in the story.  The boy, Leo, is really funny, as he feels really important because everyone comes running when he yells wolf.  The sheep he is watching even have some pretty funny lines like, ""You're not so faaascinating yourself, Leo.""  It ends up that Telly has to tell the truth when his uncle (Dennis Quaid) comes to pick him up and finds out he lied about his job.  It turns out Uncle Tommy is really an astronaut, which the daycare kids think is way better than a ringmaster anyways.  Definitely worth buying!",1140048000,,933,4.3468208092485545
7870082,5,6304279507,"My 4 year old has loved this since he was 3 - every few days he will want to watch it again, and I don't mind becuase its charming, and there's some adult ""wit"" sneaked into the dialogue.  The scenario - Telly telling a lie about his Uncle being a Ringmaster of a Circus, Gina telling the Story of the Boy who Cried Wolf, Elmo Dreaming Himself into the Story, & Telly's Uncle unexpectedly appearing (Dennis Quaid) with Telly having to admit he told a lie all combine well.  The songs aren't bad either - my Son likes to have me sing along and yes, I've memorized them.  Definitely worth buying.",1111795200,5,594,4.333333333333333
7870083,5,6304279507,"The world we live in is so full of false hopes and promises that so much of the time people forget to teach their children that being truthful, our word and our honor, is the most important thing we can offer.  Children need to learn that telling the truth is a good thing, and not a thing of the past.  This Sesame Street video reminds us, as adults, and them as children that although it's not always the easiest road it is always the best choice.",1013644800,9,449,4.209302325581396
7870084,4,6304279507,"My 14 month old is quite a handful, except when he is watching Sesame Street.  He is especially fond of this Kids Guide to Life video!  The story revolves around Telly and Elmo and various muppet monster and child friends  who are in Gina's Family Daycare, Sesame Street's child daycare center.  All are discussing how great the circus is.  Some children and monsters  already went and some will be going that evening, including Gina.  Telly  feels very left out.  Gina proceeds to read a story about the boy who cried  wolf while Elmo takes a nap and dreams he is in the story and is  responsible to help the muppet boy watch the sheep, with results that teach  children it is very important to tell the truth for many reasons.  This is  illustrated by the muppet boy ""crying wolf"" so many times his  muppet family does not believe him (and of course Elmo) when the real wolf  comes.  If you have the Learning to Share video, you will recognize the  wolf, but he has a bit of a French flair to him, which is quite  entertaining.  Before the story has ended, back at the daycare center,  Telly has decided to say that his Uncle Tommy (played by Dennis Quaid) is a  ringmaster in the circus, in order to feel important and gain attention!  Of course, this is not true, and he then has to ""fess up"" and  tell his friends that what he said was a lie, even though he is nervous  that no one will want to be his friend anymore.  The musical numbers and  comedy, which is also aimed at adults, is very well done.  This video is  suggested for all children and parents, as we all have to deal with truth  versus fiction in many real-life situations each day.",964656000,12,1651,4.370860927152318
