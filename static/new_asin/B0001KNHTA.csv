2008846,4,B0001KNHTA,"This is a documentary. Do not expect big battle reenactments.  Not a lot of digitally rendered battles or anything either. Visually, this is a fairly dull documentary.

It is very informative, however, and I thought the pace and narration was good. It covers a swath of time, from the origins of Spartan civilization to their decline. It is not simply a description of various battles and wars and I think it offers you an interesting and rounded understanding of Spartan society and culture.

This is probably interesting to someone very curious about the Spartan with little to intermediate knowledge or someone happy to hear what they may already know from a slightly different persepctive. I enjoyed it and will watch it more than once.",1127433600,13,740,4.951612903225806
2008847,5,B0001KNHTA,"Most modern documetaries take one of two paths: the Kenn Burns type (lots of vintage photos, celebrity voice-overs reading period material), or the Michael Wood type (modern expert in jeans wanders modern site of historic importance, describing the events and showcasing artifacts). This one takes the Wood approach, with a charming host reminiscent of the young Diana Rigg. Bettany Hughes is our expert, having a BA MA Hons in Ancient and Modern History from Oxford. She often delivers information with the hushed relish of a buddy sharing a particularly juicy bit of gossip. It's a great series that draws you in with nice visuals and music. Of particular interest are the Hoplite reenactors, who have the commands and troop movements down flawlessly. This is worth re-watching for the depth of information, even if some of the conclusions (obviously from Paul Cartledge's book) are controversial. Ms. Hughes has a forthcoming book on Helen of Troy which should be worth a look.",1111017600,12,980,5.13125
2008848,5,B0001KNHTA,"I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of ""The Spartans"" here on Amazon, because I honestly thought that this program was quite good, maybe just not quite in the style of what some viewers were expecting.  I first saw it by chance on PBS and couldn't wait to get the DVD.

I can understand some of the comments about how it doesn't do things like get a variety of researchers and historians together for commentaries, or show 3D animations, or that the battle reenactment gets a bit repetitive after a while.  However, it seems to have been the filmmakers' intention to use more of a ""walking tour"" approach, with host Bettany Hughes taking the audience by foot or by car around sites as they are today and explaining how things were like back in the day.  The style of the program is very similar to walking tours I went on when I visited Italy back in college.  This DVD is probably the next best thing to going over to visit the Spartan sites in person!

The location photography was terrific and the music was pretty solid as well.  The presentation content was also strong and fits the walking tour format - informative and accessible to pretty much anyone, touching on major themes and ideas, and not getting too overly crammed with detailed statistics.  All the major people and events in Spartan history are vividly described and analyzed.  Alcibiades comes off like a rascal and Lysander seems like a clever fox.  I highly recommend this show if you want to go walk around Greece and hear ancient history all in the comfort of your own chair!",1101686400,12,1560,4.59927797833935
2008849,4,B0001KNHTA,"Having taught ""Ancient Greece"" on the college level I was impressed with the PBS production of ""The Spartans"" and will no doubt make use of the video in class the next time around.  Here is serious history in a comfortable format.  Part travelogue with ample views of the pertinent areas in Greece (Hellas) this program transports the viewer to the important sites and makes history seem contemporary.  Bettany Hughes serves as an amiable, well spoken, and informed host who is as engaging as the subject matter.  While most subjects are handled quite well, Spartan society and constitution, the Persian Wars, the Peloponnesian Wars, and the singularly distinct status of Spartan women, there is one weakness.  A bit more could have been said about the rise of Sparta's late rival, Thebes, and its great leader Epaminondas (who is not even mentioned).  Beyond that watch, learn and enjoy.",1094515200,35,888,5.0479452054794525
2008850,4,B0001KNHTA,"Thorough but has a slightly out-of-date feel due to no computer animated battle scenes as seen on History Channel's programs of the ancient Greeks. The Spartan's cruelty to their slaves and rampant homosexuality in both sexes could have been analyzed through interviews with a couple of academics (along with some moderately strong comparisons to Nazi Germany). Doing this would have broken the monotony of constantly having the middle-aged actress explaining everything.

An overall okay effort enchanced by the severe scarcity of productions about the Spartans.",1093305600,7,563,5.623529411764705
2008851,5,B0001KNHTA,"An engaging documentary artfully assembled, this 2003 British production has been a hit for PBS in the United States, with the videos and tie-in book (the US edition of Paul Cartledge's The Spartans) often on backorder status.  It is a rarity in that it gives Sparta its due for helping Greece resist the Persian threat and credits Sparta for its more enlightened attitude toward women.  Although at times it may project a faint pro-Athens bias, host Bettany Hughes is a sympathetic and knowledgeable narrator.  THE SPARTANS boasts terrific location photography by Douglas Hartington, with some impressive aerial shots of the Taygetus gorges.  For the first time in a television documentary, we are treated to detailed examination of many artifacts in the Sparta Museum as well as shown many photos of archaeological excavations at Sparta.  The atmospheric soundtrack  is composed by Anthony Burke.  Evocative reenactor footage is used - not as much as in the A&E production ""Rise & fall of the Spartans,""  maybe, but effectively presented, even if the footage tends to be come repetitive by Part 3.

Part 1
THE SPARTANS opens at Thermopylae and with the epitaph of the Three Hundred -- and very stirring it is to hear this spoken in the original Greek -- before introducing some of the topics that will be addressed in the program.  (Hmm.  The claim that ""male homosexuality was compulsory"" is extremely dubious; the first boldfaced assertion as fact of a subject hotly debated among ancient and modern experts.)  After the introduction, we journey to the Dark Ages of Greece, the end of the Achaean Age and the coming of the Dorian Greeks to the Peloponnesus and Laconia.  An effective look at the development of hoplite warfare is presented.  Next comes the Messenian conquest, then the establishment of the Spartan constitution.  The upbringing of Spartan youths, warts and all, is then addressed at length.  A good point is made that the sublimation of the individual as practiced by the Spartans can be very liberating - ""the possibility of transcending your limitations as an individual and becoming part of something bigger and better.""  Spartan institutions are credited for initiating a system of political rights and responsibilities among its citizens centuries before other Greek states conceived of such things.

The finding of the so-called statue of Leonidas in 1925 is used to introduce the Persian Wars, which are then examined in detail.  There is much footage of Thermopylae, including the eponymous hot springs, and the commentary casts the Spartans' self-sacrifice in terms that hearken to the Japanese samurai's bushido code.

Part 2
This segment begins by exploring at how Sparta and Athens fell out after the Persian Wars, with a look at Athenian politics and society and how these contrasted to Sparta's.  This is a refreshingly non-partisan treatment, not hesitating to be equally critical of Athens.  Women's life in Sparta is given much attention.  Sparta comes off as considerably more enlightened, by modern Western standards, than Athens.  (Interesting sidebar - in her remarks during a November 24, 2003, online chat with Channel 4 (UK) viewers, narrator Bettany Hughes, when asked where she'd have rather lived, Sparta or Athens, replied ""Sparta.  No doubt."")  Hughes wryly notes how Spartan women were ""objects of fear and fascination"" to non-Spartan men. The legacy of these ""radical"" Spartan customs on later societies is discussed.  Amusingly, whether by design or not, Hughes wears a scarlet dress for much of this sequence - fit garb for a Spartanette - and conducts her narration while  striding purposefully about the Laconian countryside or riding on horseback in full exhibition of energetic Spartan vitality.

Lastly, the Laconian earthquake of 465 or 464 BC and subsequent helot revolt  is noted and seen as the event that lit the sparks of conflict between Greece's two leading cities.  The opening clashes of the Peloponnesian War and the Spartan disaster at Sphacteria ends Part 2.

Part 3
The last section of the film opens at Delphi and takes a look at Greek religion and Spartan attitudes toward the gods and oracles before resuming the history of the Peloponnesian War.  Alcibiades, the Syracuse expedition, and Lysander are all examined, taking up half of Part 3.  Then the period of the Spartan Hegemony is briefly described, shaped by the ""crippled kingship"" of Agesilaus and marked by power struggles among Sparta's ruling factions.  Hughes notes the critical decline of Spartan citizen manpower and the rise of Thebes as a rival.  She takes us to the battlefield of Leuctra, where Spartan military superiority was broken in 371 BC.  The remaining sequences very quickly sketch how classical Sparta became a second-class power and finally a tourist attraction for wealthy Romans.  The show concludes with a summation of Sparta's influence on Western philosophy.

THE SPARTANS is a standout documentary, wonderfully photographed and directed, and is highly recommended as a visual overview of Spartan history.

2008852,5,B0001KNHTA,"The ancient Spartans were perhaps the most intense people to ever walk the face of the earth! I thought I knew all about them - I was wrong. I barely knew half the story.
This is a lengthy documentary: running over three hours. It's also surprisingly formatted in 16x9 widescreen, which was a joy. The picture is clean, bright, and mastered well. There's some re-enactments herein, a nice use of re-created ""Spartan"" music for the background score, and plenty and plenty of info, facts, trivia, ancient and modern quotations, and tidbits.
You'll get the whole story here: they leave little out - from Sparta's early beginnings, to it's strict social code, to it's intense training, it's subjectism of the neighboring Messenians, and the city-state's eventual decline. The only thing the documentary failed to capitalize on is the rise of the Macedonian powers and the fall of the various Greek city-leagues to Phillip II and his son Alexander the Great.
This documentary is excellent! It certainly helps that your host throughout the tour is a gorgeous British brunette with a sexy voice who walks around the various parts of Greece in tight bluejeans and sexy red tank tops. Aristophenes would have agreed no doubt. It's certainly a whole lot more interesting watching this intellectual beauty story-tell her way around the Greek islands than it would be to have a dull, monotone, male narrator VOG. She's alot easier on the eyes and her voice would launch a thousand ships to make Hellen of Troy seem pitiful. (I think I'm in love).
I've since watched this DVD from beginning to end several times now and it does not get redundant in the least! Indeed, I would recommend several viewings to absorb all the details it's so rich in research and information about ancient Sparta. Both the novice and casual observer will be highly entertained by this DVD, but hardcore scholars and history students will find a well-researched documentary that will add to their expertise as well.
Well worth every penny. I am proud to have it as part of my DVD collection for years to come.",1078876800,86,2073,4.875354107648725
2008872,5,B0001KNHTA,"Let me start by saying that while I am a ""History Buff"", I'm no expert on Ancient Greece. I'm sure there are those out there that know enough about the subject to find fault with this essay, but I am not among them. This is another fascinating study presented (and largely researched) by Mrs. Bettany Hughes. And while I am a fan of all of her work to date, this along with her study on Athens are my two favorites. Rich in detail, ""The Spartans"" is a logical and concise walk down the timeline from the Trojan war (the ""other"" Spartans... who knew?)to the fall of Athens and the ultimate demise of Sparta. There is such a large and fascinating trove of detail about the Spartan way of life as well as their history that I came away with a much fuller sense of who these people really were and feeling that I could watch it all over again and pick up things that went by me on the initial run through. Even the highly stylized reenactment sections (usually a low point in these kinds of productions) are compelling and ""in charachter"" with the rest of the work. And the soundtrack is somehow eerily appropriate for the ""exotic"" subject. As always, Hughes is spot on and fully on top of the subject matter. Her command & passion for the topics explored are always impressive and are a big part of what makes her work so special. Never more so than here. I know some people seem to have issues with an historical essay being presented by a beautiful lady(?). It really doesn't bother me at all. She is clearly all about the work involved in putting these documentaries together and she is without peer at making it informative and entertaining. She is not just some pretty talking head added to ""spice it all up"". And as with all, of her work, the on location theme of the study makes it visually exquisite on a whole other level as well. Along with a great look at Spartan ruins and locales, the extraordinary beauty of the countryside is well represented. So in closing, if you are like me and have the hunger to learn more about the world that shaped the world we live in today, this is an excellent place to start. Bravo, Bettany and your highly competent team. Keep them coming.....",1292803200,,2185,4.451371571072319
2008873,4,B0001KNHTA,"This film should appeal to those new to the history of Sparta and ancient Greece in general. Experienced observers may have a few qualms about the presentation, but nothing serious.
The photography is visually stunning, with panoramic shots of the terrain. Important historical locations, and their present-day monuments, are used as production locations. The only historical footage is the unearthing of the statue of Leonaidas (though that may only be because so little is available). I thought the use of geographic maps, though, was too sparse. The viewer could benefit from consulting an atlas during certain parts of the presentation, in order to better understand where the events being related are taking place, and how they fit together spatially.
One interesting thought that occurred to me watching this concerns Hughes' conclusion that the Spartan's elitism was the cause of their ultimate downfall, which resulted in their ever-dwindling numbers that eventually made them uncompetitive. A very similar thing happened with the Japanese in WWII. Most all of their bomber pilots would have made excellent fighter pilots in any other nation's air forces -- but the elitism of the Japanese selection process relegated them to service in bombers. As a result, later in the war they were unable to replace the decimated ranks of their fighter pilot corps -- and this was a key reason for their defeats in the last years of the war. They seem not to have heeded this lesson from the Spartans.
Hughes' assertion that the Spartans instituted systematic pederasty will be controversial, mainly because she asserts it as established historical fact without citing any sources. You just have to take her word for it. I have my doubts here. While it probably is true that during certain periods in Spartan history this happened in certain quarters of Spartan society, I think it's quite possible that this is just an exxageration. As Hughes herself states, the Spartans themselves did not record their history -- that was done by means of commentary by external observers, and most all of them had axes to grind. If I were commenting on the Spartans with a disapproving attitude, it would be very tempting for me to describe them as just a bunch of fags.",1292371200,,2253,5.059139784946237
2008874,5,B0001KNHTA,"I will be a bit briefer than the other reviews. I have seen the entire series twice in HD on WNET PBS out of New York and will be purchasing the DVD - unfortunately there is no Blu-ray version, which is a shame. As a student of history and philosophy, and a lover of well-told stories and cinematography, this series shines in every respect. This is easily the best modern examination of the Spartans available. When most people think of ancient Greece, they usually think of the Athenians. This series will change their minds. In reality, the Spartans are just as important to ancient Grecian history. I also appreciated the very realistic and straight-forward depiction of Spartan society. As another reviewer mentioned, homosexuality was the norm for Spartans, who where amongst the greatest warriors in history. So much for the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy of the US Armed Forces. It is an interesting contrast to our modern American ""values"". Homosexual soldiers didn't seem to affect the Battle of Thermopylae.

Lastly, Bettany Hughes is an absolute revelation. She can be my history professor anytime:) Seriously though, Hughes brings a great charisma, charm, and immediacy to this presentation, which she also contributed greatly to as a scholar as well as ""host"". The production values are also outstanding. This is a first-class production all the way. In my opinion, the only historical documentary in the last decade to surpass ""The Spartans"" is Michael Woods immensely ambitious ""The Story of India"".",1247702400,2,1515,5.108870967741935
2008875,4,B0001KNHTA,"Bettany Hughes' video ""The Spartans"" is a vivid exploration of ancient Greece's second city-state from the Bronze Age through its later rise and decline as a political and military force.  Ms. Hughes, a writer and BBC television personality, who holds Oxford degrees in ancient and modern history, presents her material in a relaxed and informal style that charms as well as informs the viewer.

 She begins her story by acknowledging that when most people think of ancient Greece, they think of Athens.  She then suggests that we also owe Sparta a debt for our political and cultural development.  For example, she says that Sparta was the first Greek city to define both rights as well as the responsibilities of citizenship.

In describing the disconnection between the end of the Greek Bronze Age and the historical black hole that followed it, she says, ""The thread of history snapped.""  She also says Athens is where, ""the blueprint for Western Civilization got its first draft.""  This is a woman whose ability to write and to paint word pictures is so good that it's a match for the stunning Peloponnesian visuals which would otherwise dominate the video.

Following her introduction, Ms. Hughes gives a detailed account of Spartan social and military development, including high and low points in Spartan history.  Lows include invading a nearby territory and enslaving its Greek population to provide both a labor force and a breadbasket for the Spartan homeland.  On the plus side of the ledger, she describes the last stand of the three-hundred Spartans killed defending the pass at Thermopylae against invading Persian hordes.  She's right to do so. For that achievement of human will and spirit echoes down the corridor of centuries and confers on those antique warriors a kind of collective immortality.

Throughout, she speaks to us from actual locations, such as modern Sparta, or the pass at Thermopylae, or we're seated with her as she drives from one locale to another in search of her vision of Sparta.  The driving sequences are especially effective. As viewers, we can't help but feel as though we're passengers, riding with her as she chats about what's coming at the next stop.

There are a few exceptions, but Ms. Hughes usually does not cite sources for her commentary.  There are also very few interviews, either with locals or with historical experts.  At one point, as she describes Spartan life, she tells us, ""Male homosexuality was compulsory.""  She cites no academic or historical sources for this remark.  Had she said that homosexuality was common, or even encouraged, in this warrior state, evidence might support her assertion without quoting specific sources.  What she does say may very well be true.  The remark, however, is so provocative that I believe she should have provided immediate and thorough corroboration.

That comment also brings into focus what had been a slight, almost unconscious, uneasiness generated by the lack of substantiation throughout the production.  In retrospect, it's an uneasiness that prevents me from assigning this otherwise excellent video a five-star rating.

Ms. Hughes has two newer historic Greek video documentaries to her credit:  ""Athens:  The Dawn of Democracy"" and ""Helen of Troy.""  Both, in their individual ways, effectively use documentation, such as historical sources and expert interviews.  Ms. Hughes presentation techniques seem to have evolved and improved with experience.  These last two videos, especially her ""Helen,"" do rate the full five stars.",1205020800,,3543,5.199294532627866
2008876,5,B0001KNHTA,"The dvd covers the salient historical events, but also covers aspects of Spartan male life that they never taught us in high school.  Covers Spartan women (enjoyed the story of Kynisca ... as will you).  A cerebral/intellectual approach which exposes the very many unpleasant aspects of Spartan society.  The roots of many of our English words is enlightening.  Any chance the Spartan  Crypteia was the source of the name for the street gang known as the Crypts?  Yes, and the hostess is easy on the eyes.
Excellent dvd.

2008877,4,B0001KNHTA,"I watched this documentary on PBS and thought it very good overall.  I don't need CGI battle recreations, just tell the story, it's compelling enough.  Ms Hughes did a good job of telling the tale, her narration was interesting and the direction and photography was very interesting.

OK, drawing the parallel to Hitler's ideal is overdone, but, if you realize that a vast majority of people who could watch this documentary would not be in possession of the knowledge required to draw this parallel, it's fair to include it.

Compulsory homosexuality?  This assumes facts not in evidence, mainly that, at the ""adoption"" stage of the Spartan warrior's training, he was ""adopted"" by someone with homosexual tendencies, implying that anyone of ""marrying age"" who isn't married, is gay.  With that said,  the social norms of the time were different and it's quite possible that there wasn't the social stigmata associated with it that there is now.

The portrayal of women in this society as very liberated, while mildly inaccurate when compared to modern liberated women, is pretty accurate when you compare the Spartan women to their contemporaries.  While it's safe to say they weren't ""liberated"" in a modern sense, it was the best of a bad lot...assuming of course you were ok with giving over your male children to the state at 7 years old, also assuming that you were ok with killing any males at birth that didn't live up to the state elder's ideal.  So if you watched this documentary, and paid attention, you saw that if was far from a feminist paradise.

All in all a good companion piece for ""The 300 Spartans"" and the upcoming  ""300"" movies.  The main thing to realize is that, all documentaries and even written histories, all put forth a personal agenda of their creator.  You can't take any one particular source as absolute fact in any history.  Conclusions made by others are based, at least in part, by the facts at hand and then are filtered through an individual's experience.",1172275200,9,1994,4.8579881656804735
2008878,2,B0001KNHTA,"This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a ""feminist wonderland,"" but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: ""Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother."" Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians.",1167177600,16,1468,4.872
2008879,1,B0001KNHTA,Its borning. The host sucks and is annoying. The history channel did a much better job.,1165449600,4,87,4.5
2008880,2,B0001KNHTA,"This documentary covered what I had seen in other documentaries without anything really new.  The only new thing I really couldn't stand was Bettany Hughes comparing the Spartans to the Nazis.  This was so juvenile.  It was a cheap sensationalist way to fill her narrative.  She did it on more than one occasion.  Comparing everything militant to the Nazis is old and out of date.  Yes, the Nazis would have liked to imitate the Spartans is many ways, but the two cannot be compared.  Please skip the cheap sensationalism when dealing with a very interesting ancient Greek society.  There are much better documentares available made by the history channel.  Its a shame to have such an otherwise good PBS production be wasted on poor narration.",1158105600,21,744,4.888
2008881,4,B0001KNHTA,"The Spartans is actually three separate documentaries, which attempt to bring to life the legendary heroes of Lacedaemon.
On the positive side:  1) Shot on location, Bettany Hughes does a good job of presenting the actual setting for the events that unfolded.
2) She presents the Battle at Sphacteria of 425 BC, the Syracuse expedition of 415 BC, and the involvement of Alcibiades very well and very accurately.
3) The re-enactment of the hoplite phalanx throughout the documentaries added a nice touch.
4) The theme is Sparta after all; that in itself is a positive aspect!
On the negative side:
1) She does not mention half as much as she should about THE most heroic battle in world history; the Battle at Thermopylae; a three day battle (August 18th, 480 BC through August 20th, 480 BC) for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates) between an immense Persian host under King Xerxes and a small Greek force led by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans.  Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand, and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, the
Spartans and Thespians willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against overwhelming odds.  When told that the Persian arrows would block out the sun, they replied 'Good, we will fight in the shade!'
2) Bettany Hughes mentions homosexual relationships between men, when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece, and especially in Sparta, was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial; therefore, calling for EXTREME CAUTION when dealing with such matters.  She even goes as far as to proclaim that it was compulsory!  What people do in their own bedrooms is their own business, but to involve Greece's great men and legends in alleged homosexual acts, shows complete lack of respect as well as lack of basic/elementary knowledge of the era in question, with most frequent the misinterpretation of love between friends which did not include anything sexual or homosexual whatsoever!  The warrior-heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.
3) Moreover, there are so many stories relating to the honor and glory of the Spartan hoplites, which are left unsaid; instead only a few and mediocre at that were mentioned.  What ever happened to:
i) The reason why they wore red cloaks.
ii) The reason why they had two kings and the names of the Royal Houses i.e. The Agiads and the Eurypontids.
iii) The story with the boy and the fox that ate its way through his stomach, but he did not cringe.
iv) The story of the stranger who asked the Spartans what happened to adulterers in Sparta, only to be told that they would have to pay as compensation a bull big enough to stand on Mount Taygetus and drink from the river Eurotas, meaning that there are no adulterers in Sparta.
v) The story of the mother who killed her son for having been hit with an arrow in the back (i.e. having turned his back to the enemy).
vi) The story of the mother who upon seeing her son's friend asked how the battle had gone and when her son's friend replied that her child had died, she told him that was not what she had asked; her question was whether Sparta had been victorious.
vii) The Queen of Sparta Gorgo, (and wife to King Leonidas) who when asked by a foreign woman 'how is it that Spartan women are the only ones who rule men?' she answered: 'Yes, for we are the only ones who give birth to men.'
viii) How in Sparta only men who died on the battlefield and women who died during, or shortly after, giving birth were entitled to having a tombstone erected in their honor.
ix) Pausanias' words following the Battle of Platae of 479 BC as to why his Spartans were eating Melas Zomos (the broth) instead of feasting like the rest of the Greeks, 'We are Spartans.'
x) Pausanias' fate after setting up a monument in the Hellespont commemorating the victory over the Persians.
4) In addition she does tend to go off and talk about the other city-states more than she should when the theme is Sparta and not Greece as whole.
Nevertheless, The Spartans will bring out interest in the famed inhabitants of Lacedaemon, and hopefully more books, movies, and documentaries will present these heroes (both men and women) with the reverence and respect they truly deserve.
Strongly recommended is the 1962 film The 300 Spartans; a movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Greece and Freedom.",1151539200,24,4695,4.732273838630807

8013631,5,B0001KNHTA,"This Excellent Documentary about the Ancient Spartans by Ms. Hughes was the first time that I saw her on the small screen. (That is if you consider my 100 plus inch TV a small screen) All together, I was very much impressed by her width and depth of knowledge that this film presented about the history of the  Garrison State of Sparta. For Example.  The telling of the Tom Boys / Women of Sparta was a excellent example of a  real eye opener for me by the way. I think that this film helps address the story about Sparta as it seems to me. That they always neglected by the over emphasis of study of the Athenians as the Fair Hair Boys of Classical Greece.
  Bottom line. If ones is interested to learn about Ancient Hellenes and a strange and interesting society. Then this would be a very good start in my humble opinion. My Only complaint is the lack of mention of the rise of Macedon and that over achiever Al the Great. That and I only wish that this film had come out earlier as I could of really used it in my classroom. Oh well!",1469145600,,1037,4.217171717171717
8013632,5,B0001KNHTA,"Given the Spartans really didn't leave much behind to ponder beyond what the classical writers tell us, Hughes does an excellent job here sorting out what is known and what could be inferred. The cinematography is well done and some re-enactments give it all a little extra bling. Ancient Sparta was doomed from the start due to their draconian system but managed to hang on for many generations making a note in history and sharing some ideals with other countries even today.",1459382400,,477,4.829268292682927

8013635,4,B0001KNHTA,"Very informative.
The Spartans of antiquity showed how a society can be stable over hundreds of years by a constitution that places power in the hands of beings wit accent on the welfare of the society rather than the ego.
 I would (as my native language is not english)have wanted subtitlesin the DVD. At times I did not manage to hear what was said.",1396224000,2,351,4.484375
8013636,3,B0001KNHTA,"THE SPARTANS, (2004).  A BBC Channel 4 British television series by popular presenter Bettany Hughes that focuses on the ancient Greek city state of Sparta.  It is a historical documentary that gives us a lot of the military history of this famous society. The viewer might consider it a prequel backgrounder for watching the recent sandals and sword epic THE 300 about these  fearsome warriors.  Among the various Greek city-states, Sparta was distinctive because of the rigorous military regimen it ingrained in its people. The program examines the militaristic, collective and organized social construction assembled by them.  Less well-known factors in its profile appear to have been compulsory  yes, compulsory  homosexual relationships in its military; its enslavement of its neighbors, the Mycenaean, so that they would do all its dirty work, and the unparalleled in the ancient world freedom given its women.  It  was a highly  interesting society, whose influence is felt worldwide to the current day. The documentary arrives as one 180 minute disk, consisting of three one-hour episodes presented by Hughes.  It has subtitles, which most viewers will find welcome in dealing with this largely unfamiliar material.

The episodic nature of the material means that there is a certain amount of repetition, both verbally, and visually, in the reenactments of historic events.  Some viewers may find this  boring.  There is also, for better or worse, quite a lot of footage of the good-looking presenter, in outfits on the skimpy side, driving around and scrambling around present-day Greece.  The series touches on the famous battle of  Thermopylae, of course, also on the battles of Salamis and Marathon, and the fall of Athens to the Persians.  It also introduces us to some well-known ancients, Alcibiades, Lysander,  Themistocles.  In fact, we know a great deal of ancient Greek history, and much of it is presented here.  I studied ancient Greek history with an excellent teacher, who single-handedly reenacted for us the battle of Thermopylae, at Cornell University, granted, many years ago.  And I was unable to absorb all the information presented at one binge sitting: I had to go back and watch the episodes individually.  So, a warning: don't try to get all this in one viewing.

The London-born Hughes, the child of actors, discovered an interest in classical history at the age of four, after watching a documentary on the ancient King Tutankhamen of Egypt. As a teenager, she learned Latin and Greek. She won a scholarship to St. Hilda's College, Oxford. Upon graduation, she was offered a fellowship at Britain's highly esteemed Victoria and Albert Museum, but instead chose a research grant that allowed her to travel through the Balkans and Asia Minor, examining ancient public spectacles and amusements. She's written articles, and published a book, HELEN OF TROY: GODDESS, PRINCESS, WHORE , in 2005. She wrote and presented a radio series on medieval history. And, of course, she has written and presented numerous popular TV documentaries for the BBC, PBS, and the Discovery Channel. Among the best known: THE SPARTANS; HELEN OF TROY; WHEN THE MOORS RULED IN EUROPE; and MINOTAURS ISLAND, all of which I have reviewed in these pages. This handsome and vital young woman, who seems always to have been bound for glory herself, is also the mother of two young daughters, Sorrel and May.",1386288000,,3411,5.16
8013637,5,B0001KNHTA,"As an Ancient History major, many decades removed from undergraduate school, I found the DVD breath taking.  The research that went into the production appears to be spot on.  Moreover, the documentaries analysis of Spartan policies, and their results, speak for themselves.

Sparta was a land / society of vast contradictions and this wonderfully entertaining DVD makes them jump off the screen.  Women's liberation was there in spades, put they terrorized and murdered their fellow citizens (Helots) to keep them in line.  They had the best hoplite army of the era, but they could not win a peace.  They beleived in ""freedom"" for those equals who were Spartan citizens, but enslaved a sister Greek nation.

Really good documentary.  Many lessons to be learned.",1344297600,,762,5.138211382113822
8013638,1,B0001KNHTA,"I have to believe that many of the favorable reviews on this DVD were sponsored by Bettany Hughes.

I was disappointed when I viewed this DVD. There are two reasons: (1) There are very, very few meaningful images in this documentary. Most of the images are stock images that have little to do with the history and character of ancient Sparta or its inhabitants; (2) This film is long on contemporary propaganda and very, very short on facts, history or interesting aspects of Sparta and its people.

Much of the film is feminist revision. I welcome films which point out the important roles that women have played in history. I do not want to waste my time and leisure hours rehashing decades of feminist cliches super-imposed, inaccurately, on ancient civilizations.

This documentary is a poor imitation of Michael Wood and his excellent narratives of history filmed in the 1980's. Unlike Wood's excellent documentaries, this film is almost devoid of images of Spartan artifacts and the narrative never coincides with the images being displayed on the screen. Most of the time, It repeats the same images, over and over, and over, and over, of a modern town in Peloponnesia as a representation of ancient Sprats, or a fertility symbol with prominent genitals that has little to do with the history or culture of ancient Sparta. The are very few references to art depicting the Spartans in history. The film lumps a thousand years of Spartan history into one homogenous period that illustrates the writer's personal modernist views.

The truth, as any student of history about ancient Greece knows, is that the Spartan culture evolved over many centuries. The roles that men and women played changed over time and included many varying social paradigms over many centuries. This film would lead you to believe that all women were repressed in Sparta (notwithstanding the many notable achievements of Spartan women in history) and that men were glorified. The roles of men in Sparta that are portrayed in this film are severely limited to sensational narrative about the brutality men endured in Sparta. The men are portrayed merely as expendable fanatics of violence and engines of destruction (much as they are mis-portrayed in our modern day culture). The roles women played in Sparta, as portrayed in this film, are seen in the very limited light, and limited intellect, of a modern day bourgeois urban feminist. I want to hear facts, and, see meaningful and powerful images that support those facts. What this film presents is a collection of attitudes that could be gleaned from Cosmopolitan magazine and mainstream ""new feminism"" in British magazines. ""Why is your MAN such pig? (and so forth).""

Sadly, Ms. Hughes has read ancient history at Oxford. I would have welcomed the opportunity to admire her intellect. Instead, I was subjected to vignettes about how Spartan women (because they were similar to twenty-first century women) were superior. She delivers to us an allegory about a foreign visitor to Sparta who wrote that Spartan women were very beautiful, and, because they engaged in athletics, had ""well-dveloped"" buttocks. . . . . ""Finally, some real talent at the BBC.""

This film was certainly a waste of money (and time) in terms of gaining information or insight into Spartan life, history or culture.

For a legitimate scholarly treatment of ancient Sparta (well-documented from classical historians) try: Sparta: To Krypton Tes Politeias Ton Lakedaimonion. (The book is in very well-written English, Cambridge University Press, 1964). (The subtitle is ancient Attic Greek.
