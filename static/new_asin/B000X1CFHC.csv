8226397,4,B000X1CFHC,"Desperate is a 1947 B drama from RKO directed by Anthony Mann and starring Steve Brodie, Audrey Long, Raymond Burr, and Jason Robards.

Popular B film co-star Steve Brodie (1919-92) plays a truck driver in one of his few headlining roles. He made more than 100 films between 1944 and 1988, many of them with film noir themes (Out of the Past, Crossfire, Armored Car Robbery).

Audrey Long (1922-2014) plays Brodies wife. She was also a popular actress, usually with minor roles, and often in film noir (Lost Weekend, Born to Kill). Here she is at the peak of her career.

Raymond Burr (1917-93) plays a heavy, which was his normal role prior to the successful Perry Mason series (1957-66) for which he won 2 Emmys. Of his film roles, the killer in Rear Window (1954) is probably his most memorable.

Jason Robards Sr. (1892-1963) plays a detective. Hes billed as Jason Robards since his son was not acting at the time (Junior started in films in 1959). Robards was a prolific actor appearing in nearly 100 films, most of which are forgettable.

Douglas Fowley (1911-98) plays a crooked P.I. He appeared in over 200 films but is probably best known as Doc Holiday from the TV series Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955-61). I remember him best as the soldier in Battleground (1949).

Brodie gets in over his head and then must run from the Police and from gangsters in order to protect his wife.

Director Anthony Mann (1906-67) was nominated 3 times by the DGA (El Cid, Men in War, The Glenn Miller Story). He directed 44 films between 1939 and 1968 and is best remembered for his work in film noir (Border Incident, Side Street) and in westerns. Many of Manns film have a strong tendency toward sadism which is apparent here.

George Diskant (1907-65) is the cinematographer. He worked for RKO in the 40s and early 50s and then transitioned to TV where he was nominated 3 times for an Emmy. He worked mostly on crime dramas (e.g., They Live By Night, Between Midnight and Dawn, On Dangerous Ground) and was known for his film noir angles and crisp black and white photography.

Variety called it a ripsnorting gangster yarn. They said Surprise ending gives film a lift. Anthony Manns direction mainly stresses suspense, being done skillfully.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were Miracle on 34th Street and Gentlemens Agreement and the box office leaders included Unconquered, The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer, Mother Wore Tights and Life with Father. Other notable films that year were Dark Passage (Bogart), The Lady From Shanghai (Orson Welles), and Possessed (Joan Crawford).

This isn't a top film noir but it is good. Some of the major elements are missing (e.g., femme fatale) but many are there.",1441584000,,2728,4.74630021141649
8226398,4,B000X1CFHC,"Released by RKO in 1947, ""Desperate"" is a particularly cynical film noir, more strikingly so for its good guy and girl protagonists. Steve (Steve Brodie) and Anne Randall (Audrey Long) are a happy couple, married just 4 months and expecting a baby. Steve owns a small trucking business, and he gets an offer to haul some perishables for a high fee just as he and Anne are about to sit down to an anniversary dinner. Walt Radak (Raymond Burr) insists that Steve drive the truck on a heist his gang wants to pull. Steve refuses, but Walt and his cronies beat him senseless and threaten to disfigure Anne if Steve does not take the rap for Walt's younger brother, who shot a cop. Sure the police won't believe him and that Walt intends to kill him, Steve takes Anne on the run.

A happy guy with a loving wife and a life ahead of him takes one trucking job and his life spins out of control. Now he is hunted by police and sadistic thugs. The Randalls must change their identities. Anne's elderly Aunt and Uncle, Czech immigrants who own a farm, help the young couple, but the film takes a dim view of the human character. A car salesman takes Steve's money and won't give him the car. A police officer to whom Steve wants to turn himself in, Lt. Ferrari (Jason Robards), would rather use Steve as bait to catch the criminal gang and couldn't care less that Steve's life is in danger, even after he is proven innocent of the shooting. The brutality, randomness, and injustice of life outside is contrasted with the trust and tenderness of Steve and Anne's relationship -though it should be noted that Steve is never completely straight with his wife.

Raymond Burr plays a terrific obsessed sociopath. Walt Radak is an imposing figure, not intelligent, but big and brutal and single-minded. He is hell-bent on saving his little brother from the electric chair. Through some strange logic, he believes that finding Steve will accomplish that. It's a flimsy motive for pursuing someone for the better part of a year, but Burr makes us believe that Radak believes it. Interestingly, the fellow whom Radak hires to track Steve down is the only person not afraid of him. Pete (Douglas Fowley) knows just how to play big, mean, dumb, megalomaniacs. ""Desperate"" is a solid effort from director Anthony Mann with a sensibility similar to ""T-Men"" (1948), Mann's best film noir. Though Steve Randall does not succumb to moral chaos, as the T-Men do, he must sometimes betray his own values to survive in a world where no good deed goes unpunished.",1425513600,,2534,4.666666666666667
