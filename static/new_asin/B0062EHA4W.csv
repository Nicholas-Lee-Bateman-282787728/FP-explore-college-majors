8491126,5,B0062EHA4W,"Watch only if you plan to keep your teeth! An eye opener, this dvd is clear, precise, and very educational. Should be shown to all smokers and non-smokers alike.",1331424000,,161,4.586206896551724
8491127,5,B0062EHA4W,"Amazing, informative, and extremely well presented. This should be mandatory for all school age children. The dvd should be available at all doctor and dental offices to better inform and educate smokers, as well as the general public, on the hazards of smoking and the need for good dental care.",1329350400,,296,4.94
8491128,5,B0062EHA4W,This should be mandatory viewing for middle schoolers and teens.  It is well presented and informative.  Hopefully the appeal to vanity and the shocking images will help prevent any one from even trying a cigarette.  Interesting and highly recommended.,1327449600,,252,5.410256410256411
8491129,5,B0062EHA4W,"This presentation is different from anything else I've seen about smoking.  I can't imagine anybody being tempted to smoke after seeing these pictures!  It's scary!  But it wasn't just about the pictures - the whole thing was very informative.  I learned a lot.  Smoke-Free Smiles is definitely not entertainment or high tech... it's educational.  And you do need to be over 12 or 13 years old to understand it beause of the science.  How come nobody tells you about what hapens inside your mouth from smoking... and so quickly!  Everybody is so concerned about how they look these days, so I recommend this DVD, especially to teenagers who might be tempted to smoke or maybe just started.",1323043200,2,689,4.829059829059829
8491130,5,B0062EHA4W,"Trying to explain to a teenager, in particular, that smoking is hazardous to your health is virtually impossible.  As a high school student, we had an assembly every year where a laryngectomy patient came to speak about smoking and its ill effects.  He literally croaked his words into the microphone, with seemingly no impact on anyone in the room who already smoked.  But this DVD is different.  It SHOWS you the effects of smoking.  That brilliant white smile we are all aspiring to hides a sea of troubles behind and within the mouth if you smoke.  You can only keep that smile for so long before the consequences of smoking literally take over your teeth and gums.  This is, indeed, a great way to reach young people who may be tempted to start smoking, and affect those who already do (of all ages) who take a hard honest look at their mouths.  For adults, it is a reminder of how much smoking truly costs, and not just for the cigarettes themselves.  All they have to do is ask any dentist how much it costs to be referred to a periodontist for a full-mouth teeth cleaning or even more severe, for gum replacement.  And it affects your overall health.  The messages are clear:  Smoking makes you ugly; it's expensive in and of itself and its consequences. Great presentation.",1322438400,2,1282,4.599118942731278
