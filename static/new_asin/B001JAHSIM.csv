3656125,1,B001JAHSIM,I'm sure my review would have been a 5 star if this DVD would become available. I wanted to buy the series last year and it wasn't available. The show ended this year and I was hoping to buy it this year for my kids for Christmas. Not sure what their waiting for.,1323216000,,263,3.981132075471698
3656126,5,B001JAHSIM,"We in Europe are so lucky that this DVD-set was issued several years ago in Germany and as everything except the paper-case is in english it is just as good. The best part is that all the sequences that has been cut by Disney in Great Britain in the telecast shows are included, and sure makes you wonder who is sitting and cutting out kisses, cardplaying, belching and other quite innocent stuff. In the US you will nor understand this. Furthermore there is a show that has never been shown on European Disneychannel, Ghost of Suite 613, quite incomprehensably as this is arguably one of the best shows of all with a fantastic acting by the Sprouse Brothers (and every one else).This is only a review of the set where there in good European tradition are no extras. The Sprouse Brothers are my favorite actors and the whole crew incl. writers, directors etc. are fantistic. This is by far the best show ever produced by Disney now in all 6 years and that must certainly be the reason that is has not like all other Disneyshows been published on DVD. These are however not worth buying or watching as they are pure speculation. We were lucky that Disney got hold of the Sprouse Brothers before the new management turned it into a pop-channel, You may indeed look forward to the release of this set and also the following which has not yet been published in Europe.",1309046400,3,1364,4.548780487804878
3656127,5,B001JAHSIM,"When I bought a movie called 'The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things' I thought the Sprouse brothers did an awesome job as Jeremiah, and then I found out about this show. I love it! I'm 20 and I watch kids shows, because I'm awesome! If you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Zack and Cody Martin live with their mom at the Tipton hotel. Cody is the smart one. Zack is the one always making trouble. Mr. Moseby is the manager who must put up with their shenanigans. London is the dumb spoiled rich girl who is an heir to the hotel. Maddie is the hot blonde who works in the candy department who often helps with Zack, Cody, and London with their problems. I highly recommend THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY!!!",1291939200,9,716,4.233576642335766
3656128,3,B001JAHSIM,I would like to own this item. It has been listed on Amazon for about 5 years now that it would be coming out. DISNEY is just being cheap by not releasing the whole set. If they were smart they would release it while people are still interested in it instead of sitting on it for years!,1265587200,14,286,4.035087719298246
3656159,5,B001JAHSIM,My daughter and I watch this together whenever we want to chill out together and relax. Fun show with great episodes.,1472947200,,117,4.619047619047619
3656160,5,B001JAHSIM,I absolutely love this show and I think that it is by far the best of Disney Channel,1472256000,,84,3.7222222222222223
3656161,5,B001JAHSIM,This is one of the best Disney channel shows ever! This show was one of the best tv shows of my childhood. Thank you Amazon for having it.,1470787200,,138,3.9642857142857144

3656164,5,B001JAHSIM,I used to love watching this show when I was in middle school! It has been ten years and I never grow tired of watching each of the early episodes from time to time. The quality is enough for me to continue getting ahold of some of the newer ones.,1453680000,,247,3.96
3656165,4,B001JAHSIM,"I've always enjoyed this show. I like how Zack and Cody have such well-defined personalities. They're very different but they're always there for each other. The relationship between London and Maddie is great: The rich, spoiled, airhead heiress vs. the working class, down-to-earth, intelligent girl. Mr. Moseby is a great character. While the twins may drive him crazy most of the time, deep down he really cares about them. Supporting characters like Arwin and Esteban are there to lend laughs as well. Ten years after it first premiered, this show still makes me laugh!",1430438400,,573,5.1063829787234045
