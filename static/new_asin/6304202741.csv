808533,4,6304202741,"Many say that this film suffered both financially and critically because it was released not long after the cinamatic death penalty hit ""Dead Man Walking"" and consequently tried to measure up.  Personally, I think there is some truth to that as I watched the two films further apart and enjoyed them both.  Granted, this film isn't ""Dead Man Walking"" but it has it's merits and raises a few issues that the other one didn't (i.e. race and perception.)  So ultimately, timing was this film's downfall.  Sheran Stone was great to watch as the woman on Death Row who is coming around to the idea of being sorry for what she's done when she was involved with killing two people (this is loosely based on the real-life case of Karla Fay Tucker from Texas.)  Rob Morrow plays an attorney whose brother got him a job in the office of the Governor of South Carolina, working on the clemancy requests of, among others, the condemned whose time is now upon them...like Miss Stone.  I do wonder about one thing...Rob Morrow's character is said to be a slacker who never took anything seriously.  Law school's no easy thing...how'd he manage to not take that seriously?  Anyway, Mr. Morrow's job originally seems straight-forward:  investigate Stone's character and ""make a recommendation"" to the governor, who makes the ultimate decision as to sparing the condemned's life  Note that there is a second, African American gentlemen also facing an impending lethal injection and his case, while being handled by another attorney, does come up from time to time.  Anyway, it is interesting to watch as both Morrow's and Stone's characters go through their individual transformations while growing closer to one another in the process.  I am glad that there was no traditional love story thrown in here because that would have ruined things.  Rather, the intamacy shared between these two mirrors that shared by the characters in ""Dead Man Walking"" (I hate to keep making comparisons, but the timing of the films' releases and the subsequent critical reviews stemming from this idea make that impossible.)  Stone and Morrow do have a sense of chemistry and when she's dissappointed that he didn't visit one day, it shows.  If you enjoyed ""Dead Man Walking"", you'll find this a decent runner-up worth watching...just wait a little while.  Enjoy.",1380240000,,2328,4.961340206185567
808534,5,6304202741,I watched this as a recommendation from my girlfriend.  It is not something I would watch too often.  I felt sad all day after watching it lol.,1365724800,,143,4.2592592592592595

808666,4,6304202741,"Last Dance  DVD

Last Dance is a movie starring Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow.  Stone is a prisoner sitting on death row facing execution with a new attorney (Morrow) trying to defend her, get a stay or something?  Stone gives a commanding performance right down to the prison  ""tat"" on her hand.

If you like Sharon Stone, you'll like this movie.

Recommended for fans of Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow.",1208736000,2,399,4.614285714285714
808667,3,6304202741,"Trying to save a convicted person from execution as time runs out is an inherently dramatic situation, and that is the basic plot of this film. However, having previously seen ""I Want To Live"" with Susan Hayward's academy award winning performance as convicted murderess Barbara Graham, and ""Dead Man Walking,"" with Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, I found this film's plot to be a predictable rehash of these others.  Even the dramatic last minute reprieve of Sharon Stone before her final execution shortly afterward was also done in ""I Want to Live."" Nor did the performances of the players seem to come across as compellingly as those in the two films mentioned.

  The film should appeal primarily to those who have an intense interest in issues touching on the death penalty and, in particular, in its application.",1195516800,,817,4.9416058394160585
808668,5,6304202741,"OK, I bought this movie to try a movie on my iPod - there weren't many to choose from and I was hesitant because I don't usually particularly enjoy Sharon Stone - but, wow.  This is a must see movie in my opinion, well acted, etc.  Too bad it somehow didn't get noticed because of ""Dead Man Walking"" - which was a good movie, but would not get 5 stars from me.  All movies have some plots that are used over and over - I believe the saying is that there are really only 5(?) plots - so this one, as all of them do, has intermingled things we've seen before, but they are extremely well interwoven with each other.  As I said, I am not much of a Sharon Stone fan, but she's ""typed out of cast"" in this one, and is very impressive.  Rob Morrow does a great job too, and as, almost, always, Randy Quaid.  I'll watch it many times over - my true judge of whether a movie is good or not.  And, I was fortunate enough to get the widescreen version, I can no longer enjoy the full screen versions - what can I say?",1168387200,,1007,4.005
808669,5,6304202741,Touching social drama about the topic of death penalty with Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow. The fate behind the criminal offense is uncovered. Despite all efforts they don't succeed in averting the execution. The questionableness of the death penalty is shown in all distinctness.,1135987200,,277,5.318181818181818
808670,4,6304202741,"I stumbled across this movie on television recently and was mesmerized by Sharon Stone's performance. Her looks were down-played for her role of death row inmate and what showed through was luminous acting and touching vulnerability. Her character, bred from white trash and convicted of a brutal double murder, brought a new insight into the circumstances surrounding violent crime and the reform found in prison. This movie made me doubt my firm stance in support of capital punishment (and that's not easy to do). Rob Morrow is both sensitive and powerful as the rich kid attorney that finds something to fight for in his defence of this woman. Overall, a moving and tragic movie not to be missed, and definitely notable among other death row dramas for its gender reversal and the new perspective that brings.",1011657600,24,813,4.985294117647059
808671,5,6304202741,"OK, I haven't seen dead man walking, so I'm not as mad as most people who think this is a rip-off of that movie. The movie isn't lame, it isn't very powerfull either, but it still makes a sad compelling movie. Rick chooses his first case, that of Cindy, who was convicted of a double murder. After she, not having close relatives but a brother whose also locked up, isn't intersted of being saved, he thru showing her compassion and caring, she finally realizes that there's so many things for her to do, she didn't want to die, but she didn't want to be locked up in there forever, but after that, she just doesn't want to die. So, I liked the movie, I was surprised by the ending, because it seemed that rick had done so much, but really, it just seemed that way since you get so involved in seeing how he tries so hard to save her. It shows you how some people can really change, and the dilema of having less than 30 days to save someone you've gotten so involved with.",1010793600,6,973,4.236559139784946
808672,3,6304202741,"Yes, released on the heels of Dead Man Walking,  it suffered in comparison. But it does have strong performances by Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow.  Other good actors grace the cast list too. It's nice to see  Chicago Hope alum Jayne Brook in something else--wish she'd had more to do.  Randy Quaid and Peter Gallagher could have been used to better effect. The  gender switch makes the prison movie cliches a bit more tolerable.",959644800,3,426,4.702702702702703
