4665403,2,B005EIHMUE,"The first half of this movie is sustained by our dull interest in a collection of characters sprung from the lunar landscape of Long Island's affluent North Shore. Frozen in place and cut off from themselves and each other by some kind of common, underlying rage, the drama's damaged heroine, Laura, is the only one of this happy bunch stirring to some kind of actual life.  She is the recognizable, pained woman who loves her husband in spite of his infidelities (the early scenes between herself and her husband Bob are the best in the film) and whose unfulfilled longing for her own identity crowds out the needs of her child, in this case her young son Dennis.  We're not sure, as things begin to unfold, where the story is leading and the actors don't seem very sure themselves and this is not a bad thing, as the writer stays closer to life rather than hewing to the dead weight of movie formula. Although the machinery creaks a bit and the wheels visibly grind away, the film's set up at least holds out the possibility of moving in some spontaneous directions.

But this is not to be.  The story comes to a crashing halt, midway through, when Laura and her brother in law Paul, another lost soul dressed up as a ""free spirit"", have their first real scene together. In his annoying and sickly way, Paul explains to Laura that he has loved her for the past twenty years, since their days in high school together, and has married her overbearing sister Kathy as a way of being ""near"" to her. Now, a woman with just an ounce of intelligence and adult awareness and one who possesses a real family and not just a movie family would have responded by at least acknowledging, if not yielding, to the moral obstacle posed by Paul's confession.  How else can the plot of the film be driven forward? This passive-aggressive creep is telling Laura that he has used another human being who also happens to be her sister, for the past twenty years, and who has also by extension betrayed his own children just so that he could continue to look at Laura's ass from time to time. Laura handles Paul's scummy revelation by retreating into a look of childish nothingness, as if she can't quite comprehend anything going on around her. She questions his self described sham marriage with a line culled from Sarah Palin's talking points: ""So how's that working for you?"" Huh? Is this the first time since high school that Laura and Paul have seen and spoken to each other?

From this point on the writer obliterates any semblance of an adult world on screen by sucking everything into the idiotic vacuum of almost pre-teen fantasy.  We come to learn that in this movie's sealed universe what is moral and what is good, camouflaged within the phony guise of ""soulfulness"", is equated with being physically attractive and with what one can get away with. Paul rapturously tells Laura that although her sister, his wife Kathy, is fat and ugly (and thus morally bad and deserving of her husband's betrayal), her hair, seen in a certain light, is just like Laura's! What a relief: Paul has been able, after all, to derive some infantile satisfaction from this willful horse of a sister he is tethered to.

Consider, too, as to just what Paul in this scene is revealing about himself. If he's gotten his sexual kicks in his own marriage by being within Laura's general physical vicinity, he must also be getting his kicks knowing that another man is sleeping with her each night, just nearby.  It's as if the writer is portraying through Paul the sociology of male impotence.  Notice how the male characters who are sexually active - husband Bob, the radio DJ, the guy who pounds away at Laura while being watched by the writer himself in the form of his ""King of Queens"" sitcom - are represented as boorish, morally repugnant people; and one of them, Bob, is even deserving of death.

As things proceed, the actors, in a kind of dazed panic, appear to have to search for things to say to each other just to get to the end of their scenes.  The level of cringing, arbitrary conversation in this film - Paul's referring to his daughter's food arrangement as ""vaginal"" - is astonishing. By the time Laura and Paul have gotten through their obligatory big kiss scene and Laura is afterward mute and panting like a dumb dog (signaling to Paul, we suppose, the adrenaline rush of both of them betraying her sister), and later on uncomfortably holding each other looking as if they haven't a clue why.... well, we feel as if we are witnessing the finish line at a Special Olympics event for emotional cripples.  The thoughtless grunts of teenage angst passing for dialogue, Laura's ""Remember when you said you liked me, well now it's in reverse"" frame ""A Little Help"" not in the intended post 9/11 era but to an earlier time when someone actually listened to Dion, and when radio DJs and millions of teenage boys referred to placing a ""bag over their head"" when pumping their narcissistic fantasies upon those unattractive but lucky women with whom they agree to have sex. Such are the joys of this film.

And then there's the business of the barking dog, next door to Laura's house. Not content with letting the dog alone to act as a symbol of incessant family encroachment that has driven Laura nuts all these years, the writer inexplicably creates a scene literally showing us just who the dog really is. And lo and behold it's someone's old, crazed and shriveled mother, Mrs. Bates from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", brought back from the dead and let out of the cellar to hysterically menace Laura and Dennis on the front lawn.  As this nightmare of a woman, filmed in a kind of dream sequence, has no real connection to the story, it's as if the writer is suddenly throwing aside his fictional characters and screaming at us as if to say, ""you think my characters have problems, take a good look of what I've carried around all these years.""

When the son is clumsily exposed in his fraud at an outdoor lawn party, after having participated in an excruciating scene that smacks of child pornography in which his stomach blubber hangs over a chair while his back is tattooed with a full length image of the burning twin towers (I looked to see if this grotesque image included bodies jumping from the top floors), mother Laura enters a tracking shot right out of ""Night of the Living Dead"".  The house lawn suddenly looks like a cemetery and everyone's been transformed into muted zombies. ""Enough of my stupid characters"", the creator of this movie again seems to be saying, ""I'm going to show you what the world looked like to me when I was a kid!""

Laura's final screen moments with her Dad (that old pro Ron Leibman), when she questions why he hadn't stood up for her when she was young, completes not anything remotely anticipated by her story but rather suggests another, presumably more intimate family history than the one portrayed within this film.  What devolves into a cold, cynical, mess of a movie views in many ways like an extended therapy session wherein the audience is forced to puzzle through images of an arrested and tortured psyche. But I suppose, on some level, ""A Little Help"" represents an advance in Freudian self awareness as compared with the writer's previous animated television series, ""The Adventures of Baxter and McGuire"", which chronicled the saga of a pair of testicles being menaced by a huge penis.

Anyway, until we consider this writer's next cinematic effort it's safe to assume that Vittorio de Sica's film legacy remains unchallenged by ""A Little Help"".",1321228800,4,7571,4.682468021068472
4665404,1,B005EIHMUE,"It's not uncommon for stars of popular television shows to move on to feature films, and the US version of The Office has certainly aided in elevating the careers of several of its actors. After starring on the sitcom as the clever, lovable Pam Beesly, Jenna Fischer began landing parts in high profile comedies, and with A Little Help, she emerges in her first major starring role. Fischer is somewhat neurotic dental hygienist Laura Pehlke, mother to Dennis and wife to philandering Bob. When Bob suddenly dies, Laura is faced with the task of putting her life back together, both for her and her son. Though that synopsis may not clearly indicate it, A Little Help is a dramedy that focuses on its characters' quirky coping methods, and though Fischer makes the best of it that she can, I mostly felt the film was a bit uneven, with a subpar script and some puzzling choices made for its likable lead.",1320710400,5,904,4.65625
4665405,1,B005EIHMUE,"Pam is still hot but doesn't make up for possibly the worst script ever.
I'm not sure I could write a better script but I'm fairly sure if I wrote that script I'd toss it in the trash where it belongs.",1320451200,2,201,3.926829268292683
4665406,2,B005EIHMUE,I thought the movie was poorly done and the story line was just alright. The language was bad and all of the provanity was unnecessary.,1320019200,2,135,4.44
4665407,2,B005EIHMUE,"Found this in the markdown bin.  Sometimes you get lucky digging thru there.
I've read the reviews of the others here.  Outside of their synopsis of the movie, I cant really agree with them.  See, I was looking for a light hearted rom-com based on the cover art.  I really need to start wearing my reading glasses when I shop.  I was not expecting an overbearing mother & sister tag team, pot smoking brother in law who married the sister cause in certain ways, she reminded him of his true love, Jenna.
The kid did a decent job, trying to fit in & deal with his father just dying.  Can't say I wasn't happy to see O'Donnell's character die.  I cant take the guy seriously.  He's what, in his mid 30's?  When is your voice gonna drop?  I could take you seriously if you didn't sound like an 11 yr old doing an impersonation of Mickey Mouse.
Maybe I wasn't in the proper mood to watch it.  Maybe Dylan's soundtrack drove me to distraction.  Maybe it was just slow for me.  Maybe, everyday life sucks & watching it drag on in a movie is not an enjoyable thing.  Who knows.",1320019200,3,1070,4.285
4665408,5,B005EIHMUE,"I was hooked by the opening scene of Laura (Jenna Fischer) playing a dental hygienist. She is pretending everything is fine while she complains to her patient that her husband has one lone fault: he uses waxed floss. Clearly her life is not together as she is late picking up her porky 12 year old son Dennis (Daniel Yelsky) from camp while extinguishing the Marlboro Light she gave up a year ago. He clearly prefers dad (Chris O'Donnell) who frequently must work late, to being with his mom.

Jenna drowns her life, which really isn't that bad, into a Budweiser product placement (later replaced by Absolut Vodka) and lies to her mother (Lesley Ann Warren who has aged gracefully) about her life. While sad, it is done in a manner that we must laugh. When Chris dies from an ""anxiety"" attack brought on by Laura's sudden sexual demand, Laura goes to work the morning of the day of the funeral because it isn't until three o'clock. When Laura is at home, there are times when a dog is barking in the background. It is cleverly symbolic of her tension level.

The movie has some quick dry dark comedy wit:

At the funeral Paul is talking to a woman while opening a bottle of wine:
Paul: This is my second funeral this year, my dad died earlier.
Woman: Oh I'm so sorry.
Paul: Don't be. It was for the best.
Woman: Was he sick?
Paul.: No

Dennis goes to a new school and has the ""opportunity to make new friends"" as the new fat kid in school. Things don't work out too well until he tells the kids his dad died ""in 9-11.""

Meanwhile Laura is sent to a lawyer who specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits. Just when you think the movie is going to turn sad and dramatic,like so many indies going down the road of ruin, it doesn't. Even the sad scenes have some dark humor to them.

Jenna Fischer was great. The film boasts a great supporting cast as well as a quirky script with excellent direction. This is what indie production should be.

F-bomb, pathetic sex scene (by design), pot smoking. No nudity.",1319846400,6,2004,4.459016393442623
4665409,3,B005EIHMUE,"This film receives a deal of praise here about the performances, and I agree Jenna Fischer's performance is worthy of many accolades, but in the end the film and BD have too many annoyances to give it a super-high star rating.

The story follows a soon-to-be-widowed mom as she traverses her personal vices of drinking and apathy towards parental responsibility while her family, her lawyer and almost anyone else around her manipulates their way into her decisions - which accumulates to an underwhelming ending of each thread introduced. Her acting was superb, believable and really without fault for all that she had to do, as was some of the supporting cast input (especially Kim Coates as the lawyer). But so many scenes piled up of multiple characters yelling, dog(s) barking, kids having tantrums, and more yelling - that it became more irritating than worthy each time. By the end, the screening audience was not impressed with the film, but loved Jenna's determination to get it right.

The Blu clarity is solid, the 5.1 DTS gets overused in the yelling matches (which helped make the scenes even more intolerable as all five channels had people yelling/dogs barking for what seemed like minutes on end), but the supplements are too fluffy to recommend. Each of the interviews last several seconds followed by long clips from the film. Chris O' Donnell is given 2nd billing on the cover and in the credits but only has a few scenes so I would say this film is not a must-see for his fans. Region coded A with English subtitles only. Rob Benedict gives an average shot here and was much funnier to watch in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-Unrated-and-Raw-Blu-ray/dp/B000PMGS6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting... (Unrated and Raw) [Blu-ray</a>]. As a side note (and I know I get riddled with hate mail on this sometimes) but the cover art was thrown together again without checking as they flipped the shots so the car is driving backwards, and also the film title is what she never really gets...if you do watch I hope you enjoy it.",1319328000,3,2094,5.119883040935672
4665410,4,B005EIHMUE,"""What's a cooler way to die, 9/11 or a arrhythmia thing?"" Laura (Fischer) and Bob (O'Donnell) have a strained marriage. Bob works all the time and Laura drinks a lot. Their 12 year old son is stuck in the middle but prefers the dad. After an argument leads to Bob's death, Laura is left to figure out how to raise her son and support her family. This is a movie that is very different from the preview. The preview makes it look like a comedy, while there are some funny parts this is more of a drama. That said this is one fantastic movie. Watching each character deal with the situation is great to watch. There are parts that you laugh at that you feel like you shouldn't. This is also one of the best mother-son bonding movies I have ever seen, and there are scenes with her family that will make you mad. The fact that you have these feeling marks the sign of a good movie. This is one of the biggest surprise movies of the year. You expect one thing, it's another, but an absolutely fantastic movie to watch. Overall, an extremely entertaining and enjoyable movie to watch that won't disappoint. I give it an A.",1319328000,13,1117,4.349282296650718
4665411,5,B005EIHMUE,What a great movie. I saw it twice in the theaters. Jenna was so good in this movie and Chris O'Donnel was so good with her.  It was nice seeing a cameo by comedian Jim Florentine.  I just wish he would have done an upper decker in the movie.  That would have been great.

After the husband dies of a heart attack, monetary issues become a concern. This is a very well done drama, with characters that were engaging and who bring real-life drama to a film that is attention-grabbing throughout. There are no dull moments, as this movie brings different challenging scenarios for the protagonist. The film is carried very well by an outstanding Jenna Fischer.

4665413,1,B005EIHMUE,As much as I like Jenna Fischer as Pam in The Office I really wanted to like this movie. It started out good & I thought I was going to like it but towards the middle it began to fall apart. A Little Help was disappointing because it turned out not to be such a great movie. I don't know what it was but I didn't care too much for the ending either. I guess I had my hopes set way too high,1432080000,,389,3.6987951807228914

4665415,3,B005EIHMUE,"Jenna Fischer does a pretty decent acting job in this one, the main problem though is that there isn't a story to tell with this one.  Her husband who hasn't been interested in her since in his words, she has stopped taking care of herself, dies at the beginning of the film.  Her son who didn't want much to do with her, preferring the company of his father who himself preferred to be doing something else, doesn't like her any more than he did before now that it's just the two of them.  She gives into bullying by a nasty sister who resents her for being the pretty one and sends her kid kicking and screaming to a new private school.  There the kid has no friends until he makes up a story that his dad died as a firefighter on September 11.  Of course the kid was too dumb to realise saying his dad died while having sex is actually probably a pretty cool way to go out in most school aged boy's eyes.

There really is no storyline with this one, it's just like we're a fly on the wall of some depressed people's lives, who didn't bother with life insurance to pay the bills. Then seeing others try and take advantage of them or push them deeper into unhappiness so their own lives seem better in comparison.  In the end when the credits roll you wonder what the point of watching that was and wish you'd picked something else instead.",1415145600,,1341,4.276679841897233

But then her husband dies suddenly and she is left trying to take care of her son alone while dealing with depression and a dip into alcoholism. She is such a bad mother at times you just want to shake her and say what are you doing? The son is one who really needs help in this film. Of course things turn around, but the movie itself is pretty predictable. Jenna Fischer's performance saves this movie from being a one or two star rating - she does a good job with the material given to her.

4665422,3,B005EIHMUE,"The only thing good about this movie is Jenna Fischer, and she's very, very good. Otherwise, the acting is mediocre at best and the story, dialog and direction are pretty bad. Only Fischer's perfect performance in a ridiculous movie makes it worth watching.

It IS a comedy, by the way, despite what other reviewers have said. It just doesn't work as a comedy, or as a drama, or as anything else... except as a vehicle for Fischer's unique gift for playing likeable, thoroughly and consistently entertaining losers, who also are totally believable human beings - not by any means an easy feat. She's almost a female Woody Allen, except she's not an obnoxious, whining, passive-aggressive, self-aggrandizing pervert.",1369094400,,715,5.111111111111111
4665423,4,B005EIHMUE,"A Little Help starring Jenna Fischer is a strange but interesting little film. Fischer's performance is what saves this film, she is so believable as Laura, a woman who's husband has died and her son makes up a lie about how his father died to his classmates to impress them. Laura is rough-around-the-edges, she's high-strung, she's neurotic, and can't make sense out of her chaotic life. This film isn't for everyone, no fairytale ending but I did enjoy this film.

I was led to A Little Help by two things: Jenna Fischer and the trailer. Fischer delivered what I expected of her and was a pleasure to watch, but the film didn't come close to delivering on the promise of the trailer. I anticipated a pick-me-up--something heartwarming, if not entirely lighthearted. What I got was a string of agonizing relationships and choices, discordant families, and people full of regret, their flaws on display for the world (and not in a celebratory way). This is a movie about crisis, and while I found it engaging and worth watching, it was also emotionally exhausting.",1353801600,7,770,4.711111111111111

It's a funny, charming, predictable film which allows Fischer to go well beyond her sweet perky image from The Office. She swears, smokes, has sex, and fails in many of life's little and not so little tasks just like a real person. This is a low key comedy, not a laugh out-loud ""romp"" It avoids many cliches, but not all. It's the kind of film where you need to let yourself be entertained.",1332720000,2,480,4.228260869565218

4665431,5,B005EIHMUE,"It's movies like this, about real people, that remind me why I fell in love with them in the first place.  This story is not only refreshing but comforting, reminding us that we aren't always as alone and hopeless as we think.  Life is truly unpredictable and its curve balls, as this film depicts, are thrown when we least expect and certainly before we are ready or know how to deal with them.

Life has happened to Laura (Jenna Fischer) in a way that suggests this isn't the life she dreamed of but it's close to the one most of us end up with.  You can relate to these characters.  They are both charming and flawed.  There isn't an actor in this film that doesn't shine.  While Jenna Fischer is the epicenter of the story it's definitely an ensemble cast; including a smart and honest performance from Rob Benedict, an against type Chris O'Donnell, and a without-a-doubt rising star, Daniel Yelsky.  There is also something very poignant about the world writer/director Michael J. Weithorn creates in this movie.  Setting the story in the late summer on Long Island gives you the sense that change is on the horizon.  Everyone wants to hang onto summer but that's impossible.  No one wants to grow up, but at some point we all have to and it usually takes a little help.

This is a sincere slice of life film that fuses both comedy and drama as life often does.  It's one of those movies that you want in your collection and eager to lend your friends.",1321488000,2,1457,4.494296577946768

Like a lot of the comparable ones I'm thinking of--Little Miss Sunshine, Rachel Getting Married, The Giant Mechanical Man, the Way Way Back, Adventureland--it manages to be funny, contemplative, wistful, introspective, etc. It's sad and quirky, with characters that seem realistic, imperfect and unsure of exactly what to do. They're NOT perpetually articulate, and chock-full of witty comebacks, smart-ass repartee, and instantaneous recognition of all the circumstances shaping their lives; and the plots are not full of dramatic and thrilling action every second. Instead, the characters seem like real people, good actors are allowed to act, and the viewer is allowed to linger on a scene for longer than 1.5 seconds. This is the second time I've seen this, and I can recommend it.",1444176000,2,864,5.313868613138686

8468285,4,B005EIHMUE,"I'm surprised how good A Little Help was.  Unfortunately I fell into a deep sleep immediately after it was over, and when I woke up to write a review the next day I almost completely forgot about the story, haha.  I hate when that happens. That's not to say the storyline is forgettable- more like I desperately needed sleep after several grueling days in a row of strong heat and humidity.

Anyway the story is rather the perfect blend of humor and drama.  I don't agree with all the negative reviews here on amazon- I felt the movie was really excellent in every category.  Well perhaps it wasn't great in one area- the story does sometimes drag a bit, but only slightly.  I'm close to giving a Little Help 5 stars but I suppose it doesn't quite blow me away enough to warrant 5 stars.  It's close though.

It's about Jenna Fischer who's an immature mom.  She gets confused easily, and succumbs to pressure all the time because she just doesn't know what to think or do when it comes to important decision making situations related to her son and finances.  Basically her son is a brat who walks all over his mom, which is honestly a perfect representation of a single mother trying to raise a single son.  This is pretty normal and believable behavior, the proof being I see it all the time in real life.  You can tell the way kids act when they're being singled out and spoiled.  They don't seem like they appreciate much.

Anyway before this, it turns out Jenna's husband starts developing unusual chest pains after a fight where he runs after Jenna one night.  He goes to the doctor but the doctor writes it off as no big deal.  Later during a sex act the chest pains come back and he actually dies on the spot.  I don't think I'm spoiling too much here since this segment serves as the basis of the story.  The story from here on out relates to Jenna expressing immaturity and confusion whenever she argues with her family which happens frequently.  Her one sister played by Brooke Smith acts a certain way that I'd DEFINITLEY not get along with if I knew her.  Talk about completely stuck up with a superiority complex. Yikes!  I understand Jenna's immature and not the sharpest knife in the drawer but geez, you don't have to act like *that* and basically write her off as garbage for goodness sake!

Anyway Jenna eventually sees a lawyer about the medical malpractice of her husband.  She can make a lot of money (thousands... hundreds of thousands) and this lawyer knows what it takes to make it happen.  Clueless Jenna though... she doesn't understand a single word this lawyer's saying and almost chooses not to go through with any of it.  Though to be fair I'd probably act the same way if I were in her shoes.  Big lawyer words?  Not part of my understanding I'm afraid!  Anyway I love the scene that we all knew was coming eventually involving getting revenge on the neighbors dog who won't stop barking whenever Jenna and her son have a simple conversation!  Yeah that had to be addressed eventually, haha.  That was probably the only moment I actually stood up for Jenna's bratty son.

Throughout the story Jenna reminisces with friends including one guy during a late night trip down memory lane who expresses his sincere emotions to the point I started to feel sorry for him.  He really pours his heart and soul into expressing how he always felt for Jenna since grade school.  He was getting personal to the point I actually wanted to see him and Jenna hook up!  I also couldn't help but notice that Jenna looked and acted like a girl I went to high school with.  It was startling for me.  It made me wonder what would've happened if I had asked this girl out on a date.  I was tempted to!  Just picture Jenna with blonde hair, with the personality and facial similarities remaining the same.  Yup, just like this girl I once knew!

Overall a Little Help is a great film.  It's not for everyone as evident by the many negative reviews here on amazon, but I sure loved it.  Great storytelling, drama executed right, laughs that are done in just the right way (neither overbearing or few and far between- a perfect amount).  The humor is never exaggerated that it interferes or changes the quality of the storytelling either.  A film worth watching!",1435190400,,4268,4.53735255570118
8468286,4,B005EIHMUE,"Released in 2010, A Little Help stars Jenna Fischer as a nearing-middle-age mother from Long Island whose marriage is troubled and her family overbearing. She turns to smoking, drinking and worse to cope and fill the void. Chris O'Donnell plays her husband (in a small role), Ron Leibman & Lesley Ann Warren play her father and mother, Brooke Smith & Rob Benedict her sister and brother-in-law,  and Daniel Yelsky her son.

Some people complain that this movie is depressing because it deals with heavy issues, like adultery, premature death, lawsuits, alcoholism, rebellious children and the like. While this is true, the tone is too quirky and light to regard with dismal seriousness. Some complain that the son is a little too disrespectful and its infuriating. This is also true, but its intrinsic to the plot. The films all about Jennas character escaping the manipulations of those who take advantage of her and try to control her. Jim Florentine from That Metal Show appears in an amusing sequence that reveals the emptiness of casual sex. The movies not great, but its good enough and, despite the amusing aspects, it smacks of real life, not to mention the subtexts are great and Jennas a cutie.

The film runs 109 minutes and was shot on Long Island, NY.
