7899674,4,7115147280,"My daughter is in Chinese Immersion Kindergarten and loves the English version of Dora, so she was very excited to see this version.  I can't read Chinese, so it took me a minute to figure out how to turn on the Chinese audio. There appears to be no Spanish in this at all, it looks like it's designed to teach Chinese kids how to speak a little English.  For example I've watched the Chocolate Tree episode in English and Dora always called her grandma ""abuela"" the Spanish word for grandma. In this version she calls her ""grandma"" in English and the English word appears at the bottom of the screen.  The same thing happens with other words that would normally be in Spanish. One small disappointment is when the Map is naming their 3 destinations, they're all in English. I was hoping to have that extra bit of Chinese vocab, but overall the show looks good. We will definitely watch these and buy the other sets too.",1478304000,,920,4.497005988023952
