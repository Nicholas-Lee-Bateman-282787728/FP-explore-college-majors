151082,5,0792843622,"I bought this VHS because it is the only version that was originally broadcast on Showtime.  The DVD, special edition included is syndicated TV edit.  I know the series evolved beyond the outright sexuality of the first season, but why is not a DVD version of this.  I have not seen the Blue-ray version; so, I can not speak for it.  If you wondering what I am referring to, look no further than what network it was on.  There was full frontal female nudity in it.  If you want to see the syndicated version, it is still airing or you can download it.  If you want the broadcast version, buy this VHS.  Good luck finding a VCR.

151086,5,0792843622,"This DVD includes the original two hour pilot ""Children of the Gods"" along with ""The Enemy Within"" and ""Emancipation"".

""Children of the Gods"" kicked but. It was packed full of action, it had some great character moments in it as well as some humorous bits as well. And the performances are great. Five stars.

Next we have ""The Enemy Within"". It has a little bit too much drama in it for me, but it still has it's moments. Like when the Goa'uld parasite inside Kawalsky takes control of him, and the distrust everyone has about Teal'c, and Colonel O'Neill defending Teal'c at every turn, and the way Teal'c gained everyones trust at the end by killing the parasite inside Kawalsky, and him finally joining SG-1. In all, this episode wasn't all that bad. Three stars.

Last we have ""Emancipation"" where Carter tries to free a popluation of woman, enslaved by their men, on a planet SG-1 visits. A great story about equal rights, and it was also adventurous and suspenseful too. Four stars.

In all, this DVD is a great buy.

Highly recommended!",1273708800,,1044,4.683060109289618
151087,4,0792843622,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and hopefully die and are forgotten.

That wasn't the case with the spinoff of the 1995 movie ""Stargate,"" an okay science fiction movie that spawned an excellent television series. The first volume of the first season -- a TV movie and two more episodes -- shows that it wasn't quite on even ground yet, but had more promise than most sci-fi shows.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year -- until it is activated, and a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap a young officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement to learn what really happened on the planet of Abydos, and where these mysterious aliens have come from.

O'Neill and a small team go to Abydos and encounter Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) who has been learning about a vast network of Stargates over the past year. But when Daniel's wife Sha're and brother-in-law Skaara are abducted by the same warriors, O'Neill, Jackson and Air Force scientist Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) use the Stargate to venture to where they're being kept.

What they find is an alien race who inhabits human hosts, the Goa'uld, and their ruthless slave warriors, the Jaffa. Carter, O'Neill and Jackson are captured by the powerful Apophis -- but to escape, they must have the help of an unlikely ally: Teal'c (Christopher Judge), one of the Jaffa.

""The Enemy Within"" strikes when Major Kawalsky (Jay Acovone) starts acting oddly, and they find that he's been infected by a Goa'uld symbiote in the previous battle. O'Neill is busy defending the prisoner Teal'c, and trying to support his buddy as scientists try to extract the symbiote. But to free Kawalsky, they may have to destroy him...

""Emancipation"" was the first standalone episode, when the newly-formed SG-1 team arrives on a planet of Mongol descendents, where women are treated as chattel. Sam is understandably peeved by this, especially when she is captured and traded as part of a Romeo-and-Juliet situation. Now the guys have to get Sam back without sparking off a little war.

The first volume of this series is kind of awkward -- the characters are still at arm's length, Teal'c is an enigma, and everybody gets overly worried whenever the SG-1 team doesn't show up on time. But it shows the seeds of what would become an excellent TV series, both in the overall arc storyline and the standalone episodes.

One of the best things about this show is the snappy dialogue, mostly provided by the cynical, tart-tongued O'Neill -- after sending a ""message"" box of tissues through the Stargate, he says sarcastically, ""Well sir, they could be blowing their noses right now!""

The Egyptian-styled sets and effects have a slightly low-budget style, but the script adds some brilliant twists to the original idea, such as hundreds of Stargates scattered through the cosmos. And the makers add some warm scenes, such as the eager Abydonian teenagers celebrating with O'Neill and his pals, which really makes the characters seem human.

The cast is also quite good -- Michael Shanks and Richard Dean Anderson have excellent chemistry as the cynical military man and the enthusiastic geek. Tapping is also quite good, although her character takes awhile to fit in, but Judge sadly doesn't get to show much of his formidable range as Teal'c, and O'Neill's demand that he be part of SG-1 seems very forced.

The premiere episodes ""Stargate SG-1"" are solid ones, although they have flaws that the succeeding seasons have since smoothed out. A solid, interesting beginning to a good series.",1155859200,,3649,4.975369458128079
151088,5,0792843622,"This version-the VHS-DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SECOND EPISODE. It only includes the pilot, Children of the Gods.

This pilot is a great viewing experience, as are most of the SG1 series. It combines action, aliens, great acting and great writing to make it a must see show for almost all sci-fi fans.",1107216000,,295,4.673076923076923
151089,4,0792843622,"At the end of Season 2 of ""Stargate SG-1,"" Hathor (Suanne Braun) was holding out a parasite to the human members of SG-1 and wondering which one of them was going to be the new host for this Goa'uld.  Volume 1 of Season 3 resolves that cliffhanger and then gets the SG-1 gang back to the normal Stargate range of problems:
Episode 1, ""Into the Fire"" (Written by Brad Wright, Aired June 25, 1999) finds things getting worse for SG-1 as Hathor decides Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) should be the host.  Meanwhile there two ongoing efforts to rescue SG-1.  The first is on Earth with General Hammond (Don S. Davis) and Colonel Makepeace (Steve Makaj, while the other is on Chulak, where Teal'c (Christopher Judge) has joined forces with Bra'tac (Tony Amendola).  Obviously the idea is to get the show back to ""normal"" by the end of this season premier episode, and while this was an interesting cliffhanger, it pales in comparison to what we had a season earlier.  Solid but not specatular.  Four Stargates.
Episode 2, ""Seth"" (Written by Jonathan Glassner, Aired July 2, 1999) has Jacob Carter (Carmen Argenziano), Sam's father and Earth's liaison to the Tok'ra, visiting SGC to report that the Goa'uld Seth (Robert Duncan) has been hiding out on Earth ever since the Stargate was buried in Egypt several thousands years back.  Apparently Seth has managed to keep on being worshipped as a god having formed the Cult of Seth.  Meanwhile, Jacob has some unresolved issues with his son.  The idea of a Gao'uld doing a cult is a good one, but over thousand of years he has never tried to go global?  I do not think so, Jack.  4 Stargates.
Episode 3, ""Fair Game"" (Written by Robert C. Cooper, Aired July 9, 1999) starts off with Carter (Amanda Tapping) finally being promoted to Major and O'Neill being whisked away in mid-sentence by the Asgard.  It seems the Gao'uld thinks that killing Hathor makes Earth a threat, so the System Lords want to pay a visit.  However, the Asgard want to mediate a non-aggression treaty between the humans and the System Lords to that Earth is one of the planets protected by the Asgard (and you thought intergalatic treaties were confusing in the ""Star Trek"" universe).  The negotiations are compounded by the fact that apparently some System Lords are more trustworthy than others.  I am not sure what the point is in trying to suggest the Gao'uld are not the bad guys of the series, so this one comes with a grain of salt.  4 Stargates.
Episode 4, ""Legacy"" (Written by Tor Alexander Valenza, Aired July 16, 2003) is where Daniel (Michael Shanks) goes insane and SG-1 has to deal with Ma'chello's anti-Goa'uld technology.  Of course, Daniel is not really insane and there is a tangible threat to Earth behind what is happening.  This is the best episode in Volume 1, mainly on the basis of Shanks' performance and the way in which the truth slowly emerges.  We know he cannot really be insane, but figuring out what is really going on is difficult.  5 Stargates.
Although she is not the focus of any of these episodes, Sam Carter is showing some interesting abilities off of the Goa'uld protein marker left by Jolinar of Malkshur.  These are all solid episodes but none of them qualify as ""Stargate SG-1"" classics and the best of Season 3 is yet to come.",1069718400,6,3288,4.683478260869565
151090,5,0792843622,"I have stumbled across ""Stargate SG-1"" on cable television from time to time and so it was a real treat to go back to the beginning and see how Showtime was able to turn a moderately successful science fiction film into a very good science fiction television series.  There is a special edition version of the 1995 theatrical film starring Kurt Russell and James Spader so even if you have seen it before you can refresh your memory as to what happened and get some added scenes as well.
The pilot movie, ""Children of the Gods"" (Written by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright, Aired July 1997) has General Hammond (Don S. Davis from ""Twin Peaks"") dragging Colonel Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson in the Russell role) back for one ""last"" mission through the Stargate.  Since the huge, shimmering ring of glowing matter that allows instant transportation between different worlds could be used by the evil Egyptian-like aliens to use to Earth, it was supposedly destroyed.  But there is now evidence that Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks in the Spader role) might still be alive (a great use of Kleenex by the way).  The pilot takes O'Neill and his team back to Abydos, where they have a confrontation with the Goa'ulds, who are now led by Apophis (Peter Williams), a Ra-wannabee.  What makes this a good pilot is that not only does it assemble what will be the SG-1 team, adding Captain Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), a theoretical astrophysicist, and Teal'c (Christopher Judge), a high-ranking Jaffa for Apophis who defects to the humans, but it establishes several elements for the series that can be exploited down the line.  5 Stargates.
Consequently, the first season of ""Stargate SG-1"" offers a blend of episodes that have the quartet visiting new worlds through the Stargate and those that deal with the continuing evil efforts of Apophis and the Goa'ulds.  Many times, even if the Jaffa are not running around, the have had an impact on the planet being visited.
Episode 1, ""The Enemy Within"" (Written by Brad Wright, Aired August 1, 1997) is basically a continuation of the pilot with one of O'Neill's officers and friends, Major Charles Kawalksy (Jay Acavone), the host of one of the Goa'uld larvae.  The contrast here is between a friend being turned into a traitor against his will by one parasite while Teal'c has to prove his loyalty.  The attempt to get the larvae out of Kawalsky continues the theme in the pilot of making the conflict with the Goa'uld extremely personal for O'Neill.  5 Stargates.
Episode 2, ""Emancipation"" (Written by Kathryn Powers, Aired August 8, 1997) sends the SG-1 crew back out through the Stargate and makes it clear that each trip to a new planet is usually going to confront them with a people who are not as technologically advanced (there are a couple of key exceptions in season one).  This episode also establishes that most of the people they are going to encounter come form Earth stock, such as the Shavadai, a tribe related to the Mongols, on the planet Simarka.  The Shavadai consider women to be inferior, which means Carter is in for a series of rude shocks.  The plot is rather predictable, but the episode does have its comic aspects and shows that Carter can hold her own with the boys both in terms of cracking jokes and fighting her way out of duel to the death.  4 Stargates.
Even if you never saw or were not overly enamored of the original ""Stargate"" film, if you make it through these first three episodes (keeping in mind the pilot is basically a movie) you will be impressed enough to move on to the next volume.  I would encourage you to keep going because you should get seriously hooked on this series by the time you get to the fourth volume, let along the season-ending cliffhanger in volume five.
Let me put it to you this way.  The first season of ""Stargate SG-1"" is a lot better than the first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" and you know how good that series got.  It is also helping me avoiding suffering serious withdrawl from the end of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""",1058486400,10,4061,4.721357850070722

151092,3,0792843622,"Not everyone who loves Star Gate has watched it from the begining. If you're one of those late comers then this DVD is a must-see. It answers numerous questions of the who-how-whys behind the characters and especially the ever-mysterious Te'alc. While none of these episodes are ones you'll want to see more than once, everyone needs to see them at least once.
1) Children of the Gods, the made for TV pilot, brings back Daniel's wife Shar-rae and O'Neill's (with 2 L's) friend Scara, and sets the stage for the Daniel's constant search in later episodes for his lost wife.
2) The Enemy Within, answers more questions about the symbiote/host relationship.
3) Emancipation, a typical shallow 1st season episode, assumeably meant to build up Capt(Maj) Carter's character. Good casual watching & one of the rare episodes that is safe for younger viewers. Bonus points if you can identify the actor in this episode who later played a major voice character in a Disney animated classic.",1044835200,,981,4.951515151515151

I am a big fan of Sci Fi and I must say that this DVD was above and beyond my expectations. Lot of action very well written stories and no waste of time, I mean some Sci Fi seriecs spend more than half of the time of the episode speaking about some feeling or personal changings or even love stories in between some of the characters with no action, while in Stare Gate one, those issues are blinded and mixed perfectlly in the  story and not Just a waste of time
I have ordered Season 1 Vol. 1 and 2, and I could not sleep unti I finished them all,
Also I used to see some episodes of stargate sometiems on TV, but I had a million question on my mind, but this answered them all,  for example I used to wonder how on earth Teal'c got to be on the group, and how come a supposingly ""MILITARY"" group is having two sientific minds on it and one of them is not a soldger? and alot of mroe but this DVD really answered every thing.",1028332800,2,933,4.010752688172043

Because I missed the beginning, I didn't understand some of the references -- such as the references to Kowalski or O'Neal's wife/son in later episodes.  It also explained how he Jafar fit into the picture -- I always wondered why they were not Gau'uld (don't know if I spelled that right) warlords as well.  The inital story was fascinating, and gave me the ""story behind the story"", some of which I had put together on my own, but this filled in the gaps.  Over time, I can see that the series has maintained its quality promised in the pilot -- good plots, solid acting, well written dialogue and good special effects.",1009324800,,760,4.478260869565218

It's not widesreen, but it's sometimes choppy and the audio isn't always synchronized. But this still doesn't diminish how great the show is. The best writing and FX.

The episodes on this disc set up the series nicely.  If you're an SG-1 fan this disc is a must. All I can say after watching it  is, ""more, more, more!"" I'm ready to preorder the next disc now.",952041600,11,510,4.510869565217392
151115,4,0792843622,"No sense in my telling you what the plot of the pilot is since it's been talked about enough. I am very happy the DVD version included not only the pilot (Children of the Gods), but also included the first two episodes  (Enemy Within and Emancipation). Gives any Stargate fan who hasn't seen the  series a chance to fall in love with it. Now the transfer to DVD is average  at best. Lots of noise in the picture specially in dark scenes and  everybody looks like they've had a bit too much of a suntan. The  soundtrack, well, what can i say, i was expecting better given that it's  supposed to be Dolby Digital 2.0 but it sounds like most other videotapes  you may rent out there. The dialogue gets excessively muted down as soon as  the action starts and very little base. Those of us who have the Stargate  movie on DVD will know what I mean when the wormhole is opened and they go  through the gate. The scene in that movie has enough bass to rock the  house, in this DVD i had to turn the bass all the way up just for it to  sound decent. Now i know i cant compare Dolby Digital and Dolby ProLogic  but if they can make the soundtrack on the Terminator 2 VHS tape amaze you  they can sure do the same with this DVD! Well, in conclusion, I love the  DVD for having the pilot and the first two episodes but was rather  disappointed with the video and audio transfer. Get it if you absolutely  love the series like i do!",952041600,3,1421,4.165441176470588
151116,5,0792843622,This an excellent movie and a great TV series. Anyone who gives this movie less than five stars is an idiot. I think the cast of the new movie is much better than the last. Anderson is much better and more comic than Russell.  And Shanks is a lot better than Spader. I think my favorite character would  have to be Teal'c. (Sorry if I didn't spell that right.),951350400,6,360,4.202898550724638
151117,5,0792843622,"I have watched SG1 all the time on a local station that shows it.  I LOVE the stargate storyline and think that it deserves better.  This is a GREAT episode, I recommend it HIGHLY!  It is both exciting and sad.  (Sad if you  like Skaraa or Shau'ri.)  I think it is absolutely great!",947980800,,282,4.226415094339623
151118,5,0792843622,It's good.  You don't need to see the movie to understand this pilot episode.  It sets up everything for the first season.  The acting is on the money.  (in fact at first it's hard to tell Shanks from Spader).  Anderson  plays O'Neill much better than Russell.  I kinda wish they re-made the  orginal Stargate with these two.,947894400,20,325,4.578947368421052
151119,4,0792843622,I really liked this movie. At first I couldn't get used to the new cast (Being different from the origional movie) but once I got adjusted I like the new cast even better!,947462400,9,171,4.212121212121212
151120,4,0792843622,"Forget eBay.  If you've been trying to get the 1997 movie that kicked off the television series, this is it.  Apparently ""Children of the Gods,"" the movie considered ""rare"" by fans, has been  re-released with this new box cover.  It is, however, definitely the same  as the movie listed by Amazon as ""currently unavailable.""  Thought those of you pining over it would want to know.  The only place the  actual title appears on the box in on the back.  Way to go, MGM--and  Amazon!",947030400,31,480,4.607142857142857

151122,5,0792843622,"I missed it when it was first shown on Sky, and I couldn't wait for it to be repeated, so I rented it from the video store (at 2.99 a day) and kept it for a week, when I finally remembered to stop watching it and take it  back before the shop closed.
Two daays later I rented it out again.
The  acting is fun, though predictable at times (Sam Carter's response to  Kawalksi's put downs, and you could always ell the Daniel was going to be  assigned to SG-1), but the good moments, like Jack's face when Sam mentions  McGuyver (Richard Dean Andersoon played McGuyver in the series), and Jack's  offhand comments, not to mention the great action, wonderful FX, and  stirring music, far outweigh the occasional bit of  predictability.
Basically...I recommend this video.  A lot.",928108800,2,775,4.598540145985401
