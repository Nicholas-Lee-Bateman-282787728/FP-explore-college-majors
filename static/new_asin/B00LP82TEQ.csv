8667544,3,B00LP82TEQ,"Black Widow or Kurohime: Shikkoku no Yakata (2002-2003) is another odd one.  On the one hand this is an all too common movie subject: several not-the-sharpest-knives-in-the-drawer young people are very slow to figure out just how much trouble they are in at the mysterious mansion theyve wandered into until they start dying one by one, but rather unusual as a hentai, at least I don't recall ever seeing or hearing of one like it before.  In addition there is a very clever surprise twist that will probably compel you to watch it at least twice in order to see what you missed.

On the other hand during said rewatch you are likely to notice a number of events that simply do not fit with this revealed plot twist, like the supernaturally sized insect larva and the masked thugs.  In addition there is the surviving witness that either denotes another plot point screw up or, perhaps, was going to be the basis for a so far never made sequel.  More problematic though IMHO is the, uh, taste of the creators, based upon what they have produced.  On the one hand you get lots and lots of rather disturbing rape scenes that seem to continue on for an extraordinary amount of time.  On the other hand the death scenes (a staple of horror as seen so famously in the otherwise problematic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another/dp/B00C3JUGZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another</a>&nbsp;series) are cut so ridiculously short that you are likely to find yourself wondering if certain characters have actually died.  (There are longer and clearer, not to mention more explicit death scenes in Leiji Matsumotos old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Harlock/dp/B00DELKA2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Harlock</a>&nbsp;prequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gun-Frontier/dp/B01MDNDZ1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gun Frontier</a>&nbsp;than are displayed here, and it was neither a hentai nor even an ecchi!)

Note: This two episode anime OVA has both Japanese with English subtitles and English voice acting, and IMHO the English voice acting should be avoided at all costs, something you could probably guess from the voice actors lame pseudonyms.",1527811200,,2280,5.948012232415902
8667545,3,B00LP82TEQ,"Liked the setting and premise of the movie but it was really not that good. It was good for the time it came out but it has not aged well. Also, the 2 episode feels rushed and leaves with zero conclusion. It looks like they were supposed to have another episode. I would say pass unless you really love the character design which is alright.",1474416000,,341,4.2615384615384615
8667546,5,B00LP82TEQ,"This Anime reminded me of the first Resident Evil game, where a group of people venture into a mansion in the woods, only to find out that there are all kinds of horrors running around the gigantic mansion. But the difference is that in this mansion, in this Hentai, all the characters disappear and are found in some very nasty and shocking acts, which is all masterminded by one Woman of the mansion, The Black Widow.

If you like adult anime with shocking scenes, this one delivers.",1466726400,,485,4.574712643678161
