I did not look at the film.",1388188800,,126,4.08
8229098,1,B000XQ1NYI,"This DVD is totally another movie than the Joan Crawford film I was expecting.  It is an independent movie called 'Autumn Leaves'.  I am extremely disappointed.  I didn't see anywhere on the page that it was not the Joan Crawford movie.  In fact, it is pictured with a DVD of ""Mildred Pierce"" and said ""frequently bought together"".

Since I already opened it, looking forward to a great afternoon of watching Crawford, I'll watch this.  I'll write another review on it after I've seen it or if that isn't allowed will add on to this one.

I wish Amazon would offer copies of Joan's 'Autumn Leaves'.",1335312000,14,598,4.6380952380952385
