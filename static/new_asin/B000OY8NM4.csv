2801996,5,B000OY8NM4,Great to view without some one just running their mouth about the landscape.,1446422400,,76,4.923076923076923
2801997,5,B000OY8NM4,"I love this video and everything it has on it is just absolutely breath-taking. It's almost like being there. I love the Southwest as well, although I don't live there, but want to visit.",1439942400,,187,4.529411764705882
2801998,4,B000OY8NM4,"Stunning photography beautiful music.
Sometimes they dwell overly long on less interesting scenes.
They could have been a lot more adventurous and gone beyond the National Parks, State Parks and paved roads.
The most beautiful and interesting landscapes in this region require human effort to enjoy.",1435363200,,299,5.521739130434782
2801999,4,B000OY8NM4,Very informative.  I liked the mapping of the areas,1426723200,2,51,4.666666666666667

2802002,5,B000OY8NM4,"I am an avid collector of nature dvds.  I love them as background while I complete tedious chores around the house.  This series brings something different into the genre.  Each disc is a destination, not just a theme.

The Sacred Canyons disc has a musical soundtrack that enhances the disc viewing.

I recommend this series to any nature enthusiast, and I encourage all office bound working folk like myself to add something like this to your viewing collection to provide an escape to a tranquil locale at any time.

These titles are shot in HD, and I can only imagine how much more spectacular the picture is on an HD set since I do not yet have one.

More titles are due to be produced in this series, and I will be first in line to get them.",1203206400,2,747,4.369565217391305

8187216,5,B000OY8NM4,"I originally purchased this video for the scenery, but soon learned to love the music much more.

I cannot say what it is about the music that I like more that most of my other videos, but  this has become my go to video when I really just want to relax. It is a peaceful tune which I find actually makes me stop and just listen to it. I am not a very visual person and like to ""hear"" more than see things. However, when this tune plays I often stop and picture memories of the past of times outdoors.

It is like having two different entertainment vehicles in one. One that allows me to see and enjoy the canyons as the music plays and the focus is on the scenery. The other that is more the music and transport you to a different place than the video itself. Quite unique and pleasant.

I hope to find more videos like this one.",1473811200,,830,4.104938271604938

8187218,3,B000OY8NM4,"Love the photography. My favorite scenery. Music gets a little boring, it needs variety and a faster pace. Wished there was some narration and specific location information. If there was something that caught your eye and you wanted to plan a trip, you couldn't find that place from watching the video.",1468800000,,302,4.9411764705882355
8187219,5,B000OY8NM4,"Beautiful scenery and soothing music as I go through a double mastectomy due to lobular carcinoma in-situ in both breasts
Helps me to focus on the GOOD GOD who is still in control of everything which seems so scary right now",1468800000,,224,4.487804878048781

8187222,5,B000OY8NM4,Having visited many of the canyons and National Parks in the southwest it was a pleasure to watch  this video,1458691200,,109,4.45
8187223,2,B000OY8NM4,"This video has beautiful scenery and good music. But there are no words. (They could have at least added some text as they transitioned to each new area). That is good for video wallpaper but if you are interested in finding out more about each park, you are out of luck. There is no way to tell what are where you are looking at. You have to just guess.",1457913600,,354,4.144927536231884
