8311204,5,B001INZ2LK,"This is an excellent continuation to the Original Series.  Again the audience is introduced to the world of Aria and the in training Undines.  New characters are introduced in this part of the series, and interestingly enough the series will still show you things that you might recall from the previous series.  Its the attention to detail and an actual flow of time that that can easily be noticed throughout all of the Aria Episodes that make these enjoyable.  If you watched the Previous series I would highly recommend this one as well.",1308873600,2,541,4.78494623655914
