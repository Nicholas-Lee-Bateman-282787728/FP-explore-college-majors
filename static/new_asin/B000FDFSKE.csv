Their recordings are great textbooks for bands across the nation which prepares us for the quartet sound that will sell records for decades to come.
Please buy their Cds. you will not be disappointed.",1292976000,,334,4.583333333333333
8121240,5,B000FDFSKE,"I suppose this review would be a bit biased, since my nephew, John ""Jubu"" Smith, plays guitar and sings lead on several songs on this project.  I met these brothers in Oakland, CA when they performed live in October 2005.  They have the energy of youth, and the style of accomplished quartet singers.

You'll enjoy this debut project immensely.",1192233600,,344,4.796610169491525
8121241,5,B000FDFSKE,"These young brothers are absolutely awesome.  Amazing!  Never in a million years would I have expected this powerful quartet sound from such a young group of men like the Soul Seekers.  The music touches your soul at its core.  This is a MUST HAVE for your music/dvd library.  Trust me, you won't be sorry.  As a matter of fact, EVERYONE will be crowding around the tv dancing and clapping when they see these young brothers perform gospel music, quartet style, at it's best.  They simply didn't give me enough stars to rate this one.  I'd say a 10+++++  Buy it.  You'll love it!",1146787200,7,579,4.533980582524272
