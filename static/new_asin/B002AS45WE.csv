3891282,1,B002AS45WE,"Skip this and buy the individual releases instead.  Side A contains the lousy 1998 DVD transfer, not the remastered quality present on the special edition from a while back.  Worse, the back of the box touts director's commentary, but it is NOT on the DVD!!!  An unbelievably sloppy release from Warner.",1253059200,43,303,4.901960784313726

3891331,5,B002AS45WE,WOW!!What a movie..About a single mother moving her 2 sons to San Carlos California to live with her Daddy. To find out in the town they are vampires....And they come out at night to feed...I liked the movie. Very action packed....,1425859200,,231,4.658536585365853
3891332,5,B002AS45WE,"Mostly a fun movie! Don't let the vampires scare you! Since I watched the movie the first time years ago, it became a favorite. I love horror movies and vampires but this is more a fun movie. ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" is an added bonus but I was looking for ""The Lost Boys"". There's nothing complicated here, just some vampire kids and a ""head vampire"" building a family!",1409011200,,368,4.426470588235294
