8689649,2,B00PX7SOS0,"Somewhere in the product description it should be noted that the film has not been restored. I didn't notice any major problems with the audio quality but the video quality is poor. Video shows good detail, however contrast and color varies throughout. Color varies in intensity and tint, facial colors range from pale lemon-lime to dusty rose.",1439596800,,344,5.052631578947368
8689650,4,B00PX7SOS0,"I have been searching for this movie for years as it bowled me over as a child. I loved the old Dorothy Lamour sarong films - it was part of my childhood. The DVD quality is very good for it's age. Picture is clean and clear and the 1930's sound is perfectly acceptable. Where are the other Lamour sarong movies: ""Aloma of the South Seas"", ""The Jungle Princess"", ""Beyond the Blue Horizon"" and Rainbow Island""?  There is a very bad copy of ""Typhoon"" available and a good one of ""Hurracane"". Come on Paramount, let's have some good quality versions.",1432512000,,547,4.525252525252525

8689652,3,B00PX7SOS0,"Not at all a bad print, with sparkling colors and mostly pretty clear sound. I vote for more Dotty sarongers -- THE JUNGLE PRINCESS ('36), TYPHOON ('40), ALOMA OF THE SOUTH SEAS ('41), ...",1423094400,2,188,4.5588235294117645

8689655,2,B00PX7SOS0,"I loved the film..it's the DVD quality that is horrible. I have never had a problem with the Universal DVD-R's that they put out until now. As a matter of fact, I personally think that the Universal Vault series is far more superior than any other other DVD-R's that have been released! Fox is by far the worse in these manufactured copies IMO. This copy looked like it was copied from an old VCR video tape. Crinkled and wrinkled is how it looked to me. First half was the worst. The last 35 minutes of the film was OK with no problems. I had two copys of this DVD and they were both exactly the same. Amazon was great and did refund my money. I also called them and explained the situation so they could further investigate the problem.",1419465600,12,738,4.316546762589928
