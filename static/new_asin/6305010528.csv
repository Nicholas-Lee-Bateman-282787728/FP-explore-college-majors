947762,5,6305010528,"""Men in War"" may just be the best pschological study of combat ever made and should be considered a cult classic (and probably is) even if it is a cult of one. Anyone who claims this is a ""Standard war film set in Korea"" might also claim ""The God Father"" was a standard gangster movie or ""The Wizard of OZ"" was a standard children's flick. ""Men in War"" is a concise, classic study of combat that just happens to be set in the Korean War. Anthony Mann's direction impacts every aspect of humanity  subjected to sustained combat. Amid the horror we see from the all-but-doomed patrol kindness, depravity, valor, self-interest, despair, hope, and, finally, relief without joy. In short we see how desperation exponentializes human emotion. The unusual camera angles give it a Film Noir ""look"" that highlights the conflicts and tragedies played out by the forlorn platoon. Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray are the perfect dueling co-protagonists who show that our toughest fights are not always with the ones defined as the enemy. The movie is all very real, all real personal, and all very difficult to watch sometimes because of the graphic truths, not the least of which is the insight into the final thoughts of several doomed souls. There is no going back with this film. Once you watch it you are hooked. It would be best for some esteemed critics to actually watch it once before reviewing it.",984096000,37,1388,4.735537190082645
947763,5,6305010528,"Anthony Mann's ""Men in War,"" along with Sam Fuller's ""Steel Helmet,"" is the most realistic, tough-as-nails war film made in the '50s.
This is ANTYTHING BUT your standard Hollywood treatment. ""Men in War,"" along with Mann's famous Westerns is a demonstration model of the 'vulgar subtlety' with which Mann subverts Hollywood convention to craft a masterpiece.
And what can you say about Robert Ryan? Easily one of the greatest actors of all time, and one of the coolest. Ryan OWNS this film like he owned Ophuls' Noir film ""Caught,"" (even outshining James Mason in that one) and Aldo Ray steps up to Ryan's challenge with a truly phenomenal performance.

947764,4,6305010528,"""Men in War"" makes one wish Anthony Mann had directed more war  films. This is an excellent, character-driven story. It is a prime example  of the mature, unflinching kind of war film that began to appear after the  Korean conflict. Undeservedly neglected, this picture ranks with Lewis  Milestone's ""Pork Chop Hill"" and Robert Aldrich's  ""Attack"". And it is the progenitor of ""Platoon"" and  ""The Thin Red Line"". with their complex characters and  situations.
Every actor seems to give his best, with exceptional moments  from Robert Ryan, Aldo Ray and Robert Keith, as a shell-shocked Colonel.  And it is always good to see the admirable Pine, Morrow, Persoff and  Edwards. The film has a stark, yet pleasing black & white look which is  appropriate for the bare bones conflicts the story sets forth. Moreover,  ""Men in War"" features a very fine score by Elmer Bernstein,  utilizing an authentic Korean folk song.",965606400,52,914,5.013333333333334

Adapted from Van Van Praag's WWII story,( ""Day Without End"") ""Men In War"" rises with each viewing once you realize it lacked the grand scale of the former, concentrating on the damage to a single re-supply unit as it struggles to find its way back to the Hill#465 (possibly) bringing supplies and ammo. Lt. Benson (Robert Ryan, ex-Marine) stands tall here as the grizzled combat leader in charge of his platoon that faces day-long harassment from the deadly silent North Koreans and artillery. Sgt. Killian (James Edwards) as expert mechanic fails to revive a damaged jeep along the road back to their objective, nurturing a battle-fatigued Cpl. Zwickley (Vic Morrow). A jeep heading in the opposite direction driven by Sgt. Montana (Aldo Ray) gets hijacked and re-assigned to Benson's unit. Montana's mute passenger, ""The General,"" (Robert Keith) does not protest, another surprise casualty of the war. At first Montana butts head's with Benson, but proves over the day to be indispensable for the unit, having exceptional ""killing"" skills, shooting first asking later, much to the disgust of Benson, going only ""by smell."" But he's never wrong. This is Aldo Ray's best performance, standing up to Benson and eventually sealing a great bond of admiration. Anthony Mann, director (""Naked Spur"") never lets the action lag even when the unit relaxes. The cinematography is exceptional (graphics like ""Pork Chop Hill"" or ""Manchurian Candidate"") in black and white by ""Gone With the Wind"" camera ace Ernest Heller.enhanced to psychological pitch with a musical score by Elmer Bernstein.  The war gear in the film is superb with half-tracks, jeeps and tanks lying all over the place. When the embattled unit reaches its objective, faced with almost total annihilation against two machine hill emplacements and countless numbers, Benson gives his men purpose and brings their minds and equipment (machine guns, grenades, bazooka, flame thrower, BAR 1917s) to full force. ""The General,"" so immobile for a long while, comes alive, moving forward and up into the action joining ""his men"" in every way to heroic stature. When you have brutal confrontations, pushing insubordination and death from your squad and enemy it makes for high drama. ""Men In War"" ranks alongside ""Steel Helmet,"" ""Fixed Bayonets"" or ""Hell Is For Heroes,"" without the laughs in its realism.

Robert Ryan stars as the lieutenant of an Army platoon, cut off from its battalion; trapped behind enemy lines.  His sole mission is to get his men to safety, which amounts to a dangerous trek of over fifteen miles.

Soon, a wild card is thrust upon him.  Sergeant Aldo Ray, accompanied by his shell-shocked colonel (Robert Keith), arrives in a jeep, which Ryan, who needs the vehicle to carry ammunition and other supplies, commandeers at gunpoint.  Lone wolf Ray, an astute fighter, and the by-the-book Ryan continue to clash during their journey to safety, which along with frequent encounters with the enemy, provides for plenty of tense moments in the otherwise leisurely-paced film.  As would be expected, Manns battle sequences are gritty and superb.

Brilliant shot set ups and great acting make this one for the ages. The setting for the film, somewhere east of LA no doubt, takes place in a dry river bed, a walk through some trees, and an attack on a machine gun nest at the top of a hill. Nothing more. Yet look what they get out of it by supplying great character development, a lathering of psycho drama, good action scenes, and some of the best character acting to be seen in any war film: Ryan and Ray are fantastic in their grizzled nihlism, the supporting actors are great.

947990,3,6305010528,"It is a watchable film, with flaws.

See it only after seeing such classics as the 1930 All Quiet on the Western Front, which director Lewis Milestone cast only with real combat veterans, in order to avoid the kinds of mistakes we saw in the 1969 remake of that film, or that we see in Men in War.

The acting, cinematography, and characterizations were good, but much of the time I had the sense that I was watching a bunch of Hollywood actors walking around in the hills of Southern California.

The music was distracting at times. For a similarly low-budget war film with drama, one that does make you feel that you are there, see Saints and Soldiers.

If Korea is your interest, see JSA: Joint Security Area.

My main problem is that I didn't have the sense that it was realistic, apart from Lieutenant Benson being twice as old as the typical lieutenant.

For example: You don't have to fire a rifle with a fixed bayonet very many times to know that it changes your point of impact, and not in a good way.

And walking around in the open, to draw enemy fire? Not for more than one walk.

And snipers who couldn't hit their target at point blank range? Really?

Did the Korean Army choose their very worst shots to be snipers?

Come on.

And using World War I Mauser rifles (the Gewehr Model 98: Look at the rear sight)!

And soldiers falling out of trees to surrender? Don't think so. And Korean artillery crews who fired in groups of three, always landing in the same impact craters, near the road, but never hitting the road (the jeep travels along it later).

947995,3,6305010528,"Men in War (1957) is a standard small unit war drama film, which depicts the remnants of a platoon from the US 24th Infantry Division during the opening stages of the Korean War. All of the events occur on a single day, which is listed as September 6, 1950. The main protagonist is Lieutenant Benson (portrayed by Robert Ray) and the main antagonist is a Sergeant First Class Montana from the First Cavalry Division (portrayed by Aldo Ray).  The film begins with the aftermath of a North Korean attack on Benson's unit, which has left him isolated from his normal chain of command. Apparently the rest of his battalion `bugged out' or was killed and the sole radio is soon knocked out by a sniper. Ray shows up with his catatonic colonel, in the process of `bugging out' himself. This film was produced without DoD cooperation and on a very low budget and it shows throughout. Indeed, the quality is about that of an episode of the later TV series Combat! (and since Vic Morrow has a minor role in the film, it really feels like Combat!, just minus LT Handley and Kirby). Overall, Men in War is a pretty mediocre war film, which is why one reason that it is so obscure, but it is mildly entertaining and the other reason for its obscurity derives from the amnesia that the United States has about the Korean War.

While the enemy only make rare appearances in Men in War, there are a number of other items that were omitting that greatly reduce the verite of this film. First, there are no Korean civilian refugees, even though this was a major problem for the US Army in Korea in September 1950. Second, there is no indication of US aircraft overhead, even though the US Air Force was pounding the North Korean Army pretty hard at this point. Third, heat does not appear to be a major factor in this film but in the real Korean War in September 1950, heat exhaustion and dehydration were real problems, too.  In addition, the filming location in California is a poor substitute for the mountainous terrain along the Naktong River - it simply isn't even close. Put it all together and you get a rather generic war film, as if Platoon had been filmed in somebody's backyard.

The film is obviously set up to focus on the conflict between LT Benson and SFC Montana, despite how silly that appears to anyone with military service experience. This device has been used repeatedly by Hollywood, including in Platoon and later movies, but it usually just nonsense inserted to add dramatic tension. It's a war for Pete's sake, isn't their enough dramatic tension already? Despite what other reviews have expressed, I found Robert Ryan's portrayal of LT Benson as rather weak. Ryan himself was nearly fifty when he played this role, which makes him ludicrously old for this rank. He also spoke pretty good Korean, too, for someone who could only have been in country for at most two months (more than I could speak after a year as a LT in Korea).  I was struck by his casual lack of concern for the welfare for his men and his pig-headed pursuit of a `mission' that was clearly OBE (overcome by events). Aldo Ray's character is far more in tune with the situation and most of what I liked about this film was SFC Montana. He knew the deal and seemed to be the only one with any real combat savvy.  Ryan leads his half-platoon to utter obliteration in pursuit of a ridiculous objective and then seems to shrug his shoulders, ""guess my boys are all dead.""  He reminded me of Rip Torn in Dr. Strangelove: ""My boys let me down."" Not exactly paternalistic leadership.

The other thing that's memorable about this film is the sense of defeat and isolation, which is something that modern audiences are not so accustomed to seeing in a film about American soldiers. Most modern war film tend to emphasize technology and how ours is so much better than the opposition's, but in this case, it's just not a factor. The US Army suffered some terrible defeats in the opening months of the Korean War and it was not unusual for small units to find themselves on the run, as depicted in Men in War. Despite possession of atomic bombs and strategic bombers, the US infantry were hard-pressed and often fighting for their survival. Today, war is almost seen as a ""safe thing"" (low casualties, robot drones, minimal risk of defeat, etc), but if Men in War can remind even a few people today that there are no guarantees in war - even that our troops can lose - it may still have some value.",1327276800,3,4465,4.55860349127182

Often most soldiers are so busy surviving that they in reality don't analyze anything other that surviving. There's no deep questions to most people other than living , fear, being miserable, comradeship, desperation and not deep psychological delvings. the psy drama usually begins when people are far away from war and now must deal with things that they completely shut out at the time.  pst and it's like which is 99% treatable if people don't drug or drink themselves into a even worse situation.  Still in reality the korean war was a nightmare of death. in fact the incoming chinese did wipe out whole batalions and many people were cut off. but most of them just tried to survive and didn't have time to reflect. But a straight war movie this is not , it has excellent actors though and that helps. The great robert ryan in the lead is a solid plus. Roberth kieth also adds luster to this flick.

948041,5,6305010528,"MEN IN WAR is reportedly director Anthony Mann's personal favorite. Mann thought he could invest every asset of his personal beliefs into this film. Raw psychology of fighting men, dynamism of landscape and a conflict between two different moral standards. Beyond any doubt MEN IN WAR is those things.

The film is the most simple war tale which I have ever seen. Yet, it is sometimes more powerful and obseving than ATTACK! or PATHS OF GLORY. We don't see any domineering generals, flash back family memory of the soldiers, smart tactics, or phony patriotism. A platoon was cut off from bigger outfit in unknown Korean land, and the platoon must make effort to rejoin with the big stuff for its survival. Consequently, the film offers us an almost endless march of exhausted soldiers. Of course we will see some actions including shooting, bambing, exploding, and attacking along the way, but they are treated with quite restrained manner, so that the entire texture of the film remains strangely calm and even beautifully meditative. I would say that is quite unique and innovatively original for a war film, and I believe that is why MEN IN WAR proves itself as a cinematic art. By encountering this silent yet dreadful atmosphere, we are able to sense meaninglessness of war, and stupidity of mankind. Furthermore, the film itself does not make any ovbious judgement, and this uplifts the film to an almost philosophical poem.

Lt. Benson, a leader of the platoon, played by Robert Ryan, is a steady officer who tries to do everything to save his men, however he mercilessly confiscates a jeep from an unwell colonel and his subordinate. Sgt. Montana, the opponent of Benson, played by Aldo Ray, is a deserted soldier with rude attitude, but he sincerely respects his unwell colonel. These two deliver excellent performances and they have succeeded to project the film's depth and sophisticated ambiguity.

MEN IN WAR persuades us to make our own reasoning of mankind. So, I must admit the film is an existential masterpiece from its director and it proved Anthony Mann was a great cinematic philosopher.",1265932800,4,2108,4.9660056657223794

Following a disastrous North Korean attack that produces hundreds of American casualties, the sun rises on the remnant of Lt. Benson's platoon.  Not knowing where battalion is or if headquarters has been wiped out or even where the lines are, the platoon begins the 17-mile march to their original objective, Hill 465.  Along the way, they come across a sergeant transporting his shell-shocked colonel to an aide station, something A Bridge Too Far would do 20 years later.  On the march, the platoon tangles with snipers, minefields, hidden artillery posts, all leading up to a bloody finale at the supposedly unoccupied hill.  Director Mann puts a nice touch on this film overall, the camera work is very strong, making you feel like you're in the dirt with the platoon while also showing the chaos of the battle.  The action scenes are quick and startling, made that much more effective that North Korean soldiers are rarely seen.  They're more of a presence than anything.  This isn't a hugely known movie, but it packs a wallop so give it a try.

  The always reliable Robert Ryan delivers a strong performance as Lt. Benson, the platoon commander who must keep his men going and together as they march through the Korean countryside.  It's the type of role Ryan was made to play, especially when he's got someone to go up against the caliber of Aldo Ray.  Ray plays Sgt. Montana, the driven soldier determined to get his shell-shocked colonel (Robert Keith) back to safety.  The scenes between Benson and Montana are tense and overall very believable as the duo wrestles with what they should do.  Keith is good in a part that doesn't require him to talk, but you believe his performance.  Phillip Pine as Sgt. Riordan, Benson's radio man, and Nehemiah Persoff as Sergeant Lewis, the vet who slowly becomes more unhinged, are good in supporting roles as the only other experienced soldiers remaining in the platoon.  Some of the other members of the platoon include Vic Morrow as Zwickley, the cowardly soldier trying to redeem himself, James Edwards as Killian, L.Q. Jones as Davis, and a handful of actors who don't get more than a line or two apiece throughout the movie.

The DVD is an odd one, but not in a bad way.  It offers no menus and therefore no special features.  Pop the disc in and the movie starts right away, and when the credits roll the disc just stops.  The black and white standard presentation is pretty clean and a good print overall.  Not the best DVD presentation, but the movie makes up for it.

This movie is a classic, for those who enjoy war movies. Robert Ryan (Lt. Benson) and Aldo Ray (Sgt. Montana) give First Class performances in this Anthony Mann film.  The supporting cast of Robert Keith (Colonel), Nehemiah Persoff (Sgt. Lewis), Vic Morrow (Pvt. Zwickley) and James Edwards (Sgt. Killian) were excellent.

Ryan and Montana (or is it Willamette) have a constant sparring match, then seeing Vic Morrow (SGT Saunders of ""Combat!"" acting like a sickly coward, was a bit much.

948128,1,6305010528,"Men In war is one of those films whose script was written by someone with no Military, let alone wartime experience.  I feel the film was an insult to the men who fought and died in the Korean War, in that the author, screenwriter and director lacked any real-world knowledge of Military People (Men or Women).  The total lack of discipline and Military organizational skills was more reminiscent of Corporate America than any Military organization I have ever served in.  Cap all that off with bad costuming and acting that would embarass a High School drama club, and you come up with a screaming:""DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!"".  It was also extremely BORING! Since I was a child I've made it a point to watch every war film I can find. I am a Combat Veteran, Former Marine, Former 101st Air Borne Division, former 1st Cavalry Division, seventeen and a half year Veteran who was put out on a Medical Discharge.  I've seen it all, and this film is BAD, REALLY BAD!. I had never heard of it, so I bought it. Not worth the plastic it is burned into. It resides atop my DVD cabinet, as a reminder that: If I haven't seen it, it isn't worth seeing, certainly not worth buying.  Next time I'll rent it from Netflix to see if it is worth owning.

In addition to all the fine comments made about the actors and action, I would like to add the cinematography (sic?) is ahead of it's time. The camera angles and lighting are not what are usually found in a 1950's war movie.

948130,3,6305010528,"The filmmakers were obviously trying to address some of the psychological issues of warfare. However they've done it in such an over-the-top fashion that it becomes caricature. The unit depicted is entirely undisciplined. The men call the coward ""sick"". This would never happen. Men in combat aren't going to risk themselves to protect a coward. Each and every order given by the officer is argued with. The supposed platoon sergeant panics at the thought of being in a mine field. Later a deserter shows up in a jeep with another mentally collapsed Colonel and states his intention to go back to the States.

There's more, but the effect of all this is to depict the most useless bunch of non-soldiers ever. Rather than feel any empathy for the horrors that combat soldiers undergo I found myself either laughing or yelling at the Captain to shoot one of the unruly disobedient soldiers in front of the others. Cripes. The funniest scene is where the rear guard takes a break and puts flowers in his helmet.

This was the Korean War not some Haight-Ashbury fantasy. If the filmmakers had played it lower key and only had one or maybe two characters with severe issues I think it would have been better. Having done a tour in Vietnam I think I know a bit about stress under combat. Cracking up is a luxury that usually happens in the rear. This movie does a disservice to the soldiers. Though I'm sure that was not the intent of the filmmakers. In this case less would have been more.

Oops. Now that I've admitted I did a tour in Nam I suppose that will invalidate my review. We're all crazy, you know, and brainwashed tools of the Imperialist American Murder Machine yada yada more sophomoric idiocy yada yada Bush Cheney yada yada Zionist tools yada yada....",1189987200,4,1761,4.674193548387096

948136,5,6305010528,"Korea. September 6, 1950. Lt. Benson (Robert Ryan) has one objective: to get what's left of his platoon out of this bloody mess alive.  The rest of the army has retreated and Benson's platoon is now cut off from communication and surrounded by an unseen enemy that lurks in the trees and bushes. Benson keeps on trying to reach HQ by radio, but they get no answer. Because HQ no longer exist. Battalion doesn't exist. Regiment doesn't exist. Division doesn't exist. The USA doesn't exist. The only thing that's real to these doomed men is the hellish situation they're faced with. They know that they really don't have a chance of surviving, but they refuse to give up hope.

Their truck is busted, so they have to carry their own ammunition and supplies on their backs. But out of nowhere a U.S. jeep appears with two soldiers, one a shell-shocked colonel (Robert Keith), and the other a sergeant (Aldo Ray) who's dedicated to protecting his beloved colonel at all costs. Benson commandeers the jeep by force and uses it to haul the platoon's ammo, and the colonel and sergeant come along ""for the ride."" It isn't long before Benson realizes that the sergeant is an experienced combat veteran who seems to know all the tricks of the clever North Korean enemy, so he uses the sergeant to help him get his men back to American lines.

But when they come to their destination (after losing a few men to snipers, artillery, and landmines), Hill 465, they discover that it's no longer occupied by U.S. forces. Instead, the North Koreans are well entrenched and have several bunkers with multiple machine-guns. At this point, Benson has just 12 men left, and the only way to reach the American lines is to go straight through the entrenched Koreans. So he orders a suicidal frontal assault and throws everything he's got at the hill. Even the colonel and sergeant join in the assault, as it quickly becomes obvious that the only way they'll make it out alive is to work together to blow up the enemy bunkers.

1957`s ""Men in War"" was directed by Anthony Mann, a legendary director who could do wonders with a low budget. Already a master at film noir and psychological westerns, he also proved to be quite gifted at making a war movie. ""Men in War"" is very grim and has strong noir overtones. In fact, the Film Noir Bible ranks it as #55 in it's list of the most significant noir films of all time. The only thing I'd change is the ridiculous song that's played at the end, but otherwise this is a near-flawless classic, with great performances from Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray. Recently released at a bargain price from Geneon Entertainment, the picture quality is superb. The audio has some background noise in some places but is mostly excellent. Unfortunately, there are no bonus features, not even scene selection. There isn't even a menu. Still, at this low price I can't complain much. If you enjoy war movies then you'll definitely want to add this gem to your collection.",1134604800,52,2972,4.666030534351145

7880514,5,6305010528,"There is a penchant to overlook the Korean War.  The Director, Anthony Mann was capable of superb portrayal of the realities of combat.  Cut off from the rest of their U.S. Army Brigade with no communication, nevertheless the Lieutenant was determined to lead his platoon and overpower the enemy that occupied a hill.  During movement towards that objective the Lieutenant (Robert Ryan) had several burdens:  With his Sergeant Montana (Aldo Ray), the Lieutenant has two soldiers stunned by the shock and devastation of war.  Then Sergeant Montana was ordered to escort a Colonel (Robert Keith) in the throes of Battle Fatigue to a filed hospital.  The setting is 1950.  Shelling, snipers, and landmines from the North Koreans are a constant threat.  This overall plot in this movie in black and white is  an experience like actually being there as a military member of that platoon.  This DVD movie is worthy of a five-star rating because I was ""boots-on-the-ground"" as a military member in the Middle East and the similarity in that experience came alive again in a positive manner by watching Men In War.",1483920000,2,1106,4.961956521739131
