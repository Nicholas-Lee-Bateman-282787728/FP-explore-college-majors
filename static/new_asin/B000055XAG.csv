1393706,5,B000055XAG,"Apparently ratings were horrible and Fox dropped Escaflowne just as it got to these episodes.
After watching this disc their decision seems very very wrong. If the first 8 episodes weren't good enough, these 3 are among the finest I've seen.
Even if the mass market won't accept Escaflowne, every anime lover should own this series.",989539200,,332,4.946428571428571
1393707,5,B000055XAG,"this DVD is great! If your looking for anime that has action, suspence, romance, humor, and an engaging plot with lots of twists Escaflowne is the one to get. But makes sure you don't get the version fox kids puts out that version was hacked to death. Im my opinion the best version to come out is on DVD, it has great extras like music videos, and club escaflowne, and it has both English and Japanese soundtracks with subtitles.",981763200,,430,4.455696202531645
1393708,5,B000055XAG,"This has been one series that everyone should see. Escaflowne has everything in it, action, romance, suspense, which all blend nicely to create an exciting storyline. I found that one of the things I love most about it, is its astounding musical scores. Escaflowne should not be dismissed as another children's cartoon. This is far from it. It deals with complex relationships, mature emotions, and (cough,cough) illegitimate children.",981504000,,435,5.411764705882353
1393709,5,B000055XAG,"There isn't anything new to be said that hasn't already been said in reviews of previous discs. It's just more goodness of Hitomi, Van, Allen, and the other supporting cast. This disc contains the next 3 episodes of the continuation of Hitomi's adventure in the mystical land of Gaea (""Memory of the Wings,"" ""The Prince With Blue Eyes,"" and ""Prophecy of Death""). More of the the important points in the story are revealed with flashbacks and backstories in these episodes. As usual, the excellent soundtrack makes you feel like you are a part of the world or watching a good drama.",978739200,,581,4.762376237623762
7931013,5,B000055XAG,This is an excellent series. Well worth the money.,1479254400,,50,4.666666666666667
7931014,5,B000055XAG,A must have for any fan of the series or anime in general! A true classic!,1468195200,,74,3.6875
7931015,5,B000055XAG,"Hitomi is having some disturbing visions. Visions of death and destruction; and they all involve Van. Meanwhile, Allen is wounded in battle. They take refuge in the Kindom ruled by The Duke of Freid. The Duke is gone on business, but his son, Chid, is taking his place. Chid is the son of Princess Marlene, and the Duke. He looks shockingly like Allen, and has been told many heroic stories about Allen by his late Mother. The Zaiback Empire sends a spy to find out more about Hitomi's powers. When he invades her mind, he sees the visions that have been tormenting Hitomi, and he is terrified. Upon returning he tells of what he saw, and the Zaiback launch an all out attack.

the is the first truly great volume. It takes time for a series to get going, and this is when it happens for Escaflowne.  The plot thickens, and the stakes become higher. As more characters become involved, and more drama unfolds, Escaflowne begins to shine. This is truly an anime legend.",1358726400,,968,4.557471264367816
7931016,5,B000055XAG,"Hitomi discovers that Van is a rare heir to the Draconians, the winged people of Gaea, a race that is viewed with suspicion by many humans.  The first episode mixes history, the story of Van's parents and childhood with the very real present dangers they face in flight to the kingdom of Freid.
The following episodes explore Freid, and Allen Schezar's efforts to stave off and invasion from Zaibach, who are implacably chasing Escaflowne across the surface of Gaea.  Folken makes use of a Doppelganger to infiltrate Freid and influence the judgment of Prince Chid, who is acting as regent. With Schezar recovering from wounds, Hitomi and Van must discover the source of their betrayal.
Millerna's relationship with Allen Schezar expands.  It has been obvious that she loves him, but our initial impressions were of a selfish and spiteful young woman.  Now we find unexpected depths and dedication to more than her own satisfaction.  This is true of most of the characters in Escaflowne, just when you think you have them pegged, they grow unexpectedly.  This is one of the factors that make this series exceptional.
Some thoughts about the dubbing.  Since my Japanese skills are rudimentary, I have to rely on the English.  And naturally, I would prefer spoken dubbing to subtitles.  In Escaflowne, the English script generally follows the subtitles, with minor deviations.  For the most part, the voice actors also seem appropriate to the parts.  There are one or two exceptions though that do make it worth going to the trouble of listening to the Japanese, especially Dilandau, a psychotic warrior, who sounds menacing in the Japanese, and a complete idiot in the dubbing.
Even so, this remains a wonderful series, full of action, romance, and all the other things that make an adventure story more than just a battle of opposing forces.  If you have got here by watching the first two episodes, you know what I mean.  For newcomers, I suggest you track down the entire series.",1051488000,,1981,4.930722891566265
7931017,5,B000055XAG,I like it because of the storyline. A good story is all that matters. I hate sub vs. dub debates. A good anime transcends language and age barriers. I like the film quality of Escaflowne but most anime is overrated. Ignore sub vs. dub debates. A good anime will not be altered by the voiceovers it will be more believeable and connect with the audience better.,1044835200,,360,4.46969696969697
7931018,5,B000055XAG,"escaflowne is one of the best anime ever.  It has incredible art, soundtrack, japanese voice-acting (bad english dub, though) plot, and characters.  A must have.",1016928000,,161,5.4
7931019,5,B000055XAG,"When Hollywood discovers Anime a lot of writers, actors,directors and musicians are going to be looking for jobs. This story has it all, action, romance comedy and intrigue all wrapped together in eight exciting volumes. I'm in awe of the Japanese. Their sense of timing, the camera angles that they use, the sense of grandeur and majesty that they are able to pull off is nothing short of a miracle. Escaflowne represents the best this medium has. The powerful but mysterious Guymelefs, Van the dragonslayer, Hitomi the fortune-telling girl from the ""Mystic Moon"", Allen the dashing white knight, and Dornkirk the alchemist and his fate-machine. Escaflowne is an epic in the true sense of the word and a sweet little fable where all the characters have pointy noses. If you're tired of waiting for the good Hollywood directors to come out with a decent movie (James Cameron, etc.) check into Escaflowne and Japanimation. You may forget about live-action movies altogether.",1009152000,,973,5.0875
7931020,5,B000055XAG,"In this installment of escaflowne we learn that Van is actually half draconian, and that his mother has dissapeared , we also see a boy who looks a lot like Allen. It is a series that can only improve , and i will surely buy the 5 remaining dvd's.
The meleths are just amazing , and the fights between them are very impressive. It is not just about the battles though , the story is wellwritten and Hitomi's powers are becoming all the more interesting. Everyone who likes manga must own this.",1005264000,,493,4.369565217391305
7931021,5,B000055XAG,"The uncut Escaflowne still isn't quite as good as the original with subtitles, but it much better than Fox's version.  Thing make more sense now because Fox was cutting out important scenes.  This series is a must have and this tape is definitely good and with every tape I get the series seems to get better and better.",1004745600,,320,4.5
7931022,4,B000055XAG,"the uncut version is much better, although more expensive I think its worth it, because you don't have the 'memories' just the straight out facts of event to event, although I have seen that the uncut version does say , damn, alot,  but other that that its GREAT!",1002758400,,263,4.479166666666667
