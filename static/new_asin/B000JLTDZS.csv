8151783,5,B000JLTDZS,"I totally enjoyed screenwriter, Callie Khouri, (won the oscar with her first screenplay, Thelma & Louise) and Mike DeLuca (very cool movie executive) in this episode. Callie is extremely insightful about the business of making movies. She is also an accomplished director (Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, Hollis & Rae, and Mad Money). Callie possesses tremendous depth of character and talent--a real lady of substance. I look forward to seeing what she will do next. Her best advice to writers: ""Show Up For The Muse.""",1240012800,,527,5.068965517241379
