Go no further.  Do not buy the video.  If on the other hand, you feel that as a mature adult concerned with historical accuracy, truth and justice, you are entitled to hear the truth, please order the video, share it with friends, or show it in your church basement or local progressive group.

I really enjoyed this informative video and highly recommend it. It is a Jewish narrative that has not been told by the mainstream media.  Rabbi Weiss is a pious Jewish gentleman and kind soul who believes that the State of Israel is in direct violation of the Torah.

This is not some mere fringe group within Judaism, as apologists for Israel like to claim.  Rabbi Weiss is a member of Neturei Karta, but there are many Jewish people who are opposed to Zionism.  In fact, their numbers total in the hundreds of thousands.  How could they not?  They offer compelling and authentic rabbinical evidence that contradicts the Zionist claims to Palestine.

The video is of a high quality.  Interspersed throughout Rabbi Weiss' speech is footage of everyday life for Palestine living under a brutal and suffocating military occupation.  The musical score of Shamanic tunes is soothing and also underscores the poignancy of the extreme predicament the Palestinian are in.

Well, I notice that some here are reviewing Wendy Campbell rather than the excellent video interview itself, so a few words are in order:

My one disappointment is the filmmaker herself, Wendy Campbell, is not in this particular documentary.  She has largely removed herself to give voice to the Rabbi, a voice that indeed has been shut out.  As a fan of Wendy Campbell, I look forward to listening to her upbeat and pleasantly modulated voice, seeing her poise and bearing, as well as hearing her incisive and thought provoking commentary.  She is a well spoken documentarian  possessed of perfect diction,  grace and endearing etiquette, as well as being a tireless advocate for the Palestinians.  What's not to like?",1142294400,6,2152,4.894736842105263
8091516,5,B000BRM99C,"I found this video featuring a discussion with Rabbi Weiss very informative and enlightening.  The Rabbi is a very simple and well educated man who doesn't preach but explains in everyday language why this group of Jews is against the formation of the state of Israel, how the establishment of a Jewish state is contrary to scripture, and why it's imperialistic, ethnic cleansing policies against the Palestinians are bringing on strong anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish feelings among so many people. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.  That should be everyone.",1141516800,5,594,5.177083333333333
8091517,1,B000BRM99C,"As any regular reader of the Indymedia sites is aware, ""Truthseeker"" is simply a pseudonym for the filmmaker Wendy Campbell (the canned and predictable rhetoric of this review makes that clear as well). She is simply posing here as a disinterested consumer while in fact praising her own work. Mark P. Green is her boyfriend and one-time fiance. They live together in La Quinta, California. Apparently they could not find anyone outside their circle to review and praise this film (now they'll probably send one of their friends to rebut this).",1138579200,8,544,4.989010989010989
8091518,4,B000BRM99C,"Mainstream ""news"" about Israel and Zionism generally gets a kosher stamp of approval, particularly when the source is Jewish.  Fortunately, some iconoclastic Jews are leading the way towards openly and fairly criticizing Israel as it was created, and cautioning us about America's continued ""special relationship"" with the Jewish State.

Rabbi Weiss sets an example for us all.  It's time to re-think an alliance which has undermined American values along with our national reputation.",1131667200,4,485,5.616438356164384
8091519,5,B000BRM99C,"This rare documentary is an interview with Rabbi Weiss who is a prominent leader of the Ultra Orthodox Jewish organization called Neturei Karta, which means ""Keeper of the City"" in Aramaic.  They consider themselves to be keepers of the Torah-based religion of Judaism, and believe that the political offshoot Zionism is in fact the complete opposite of Judaism.  Rabbi Weiss, in a down-to-earth manner, explains in detail the history of Judaism, including the various movements that have mutated out of Judaism, such as the Reform Movement and Zionism. There is recent footage of the apartheid situation that the Israelis have created in Palestine, as well as the general persecution of the indigenous non-Jewish Palestinian people by the Israeli army, including demolition of Palestinian homes.  A fascinating analysis of Zionism and how it is contributing to terror in the world today.",1131667200,5,888,5.328571428571428
