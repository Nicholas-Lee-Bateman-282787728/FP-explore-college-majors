5572467,4,B00BC1UP6K,Having studied this case somewhat I was eager to get more details and this video did not disappoint. I'm not sure we'll ever know the truth about this incident but the evidence is certainly compelling.,1368835200,,201,4.771428571428571
5572468,3,B00BC1UP6K,"I expected a higher production value with computer generated animation of the abduction. This is a video of a SEMINAR presentation in a conference room. The lighting is not very good. The camera is off to the side, not directly centered, and capturing video slide presentations just as the audience would see them. Betty Hill's niece Kathleen Marden delivers the presentation. She occasionally plays audio recordings of Betty and Barnie's hypnosis sessions. It's hard to make out the words in some of the recordings; there are no subtitles. I like the recordings very much. The angst and terror in their voices seem genuine. The presenter also displays pictures of what the various sites look like today, as well as drawings of the aliens and spacecraft taken from the recollections of Betty and Barnie.

Kathleen debunks many of the myths surrounding the abduction of her aunt and uncle. I have to take her word for it since she had access to Betty other researchers didn't. The second part of the video consists of another tape recording of another seminar, this time co-led by Kathleen and UFO researcher Stanton Friedman. Much of the information and presentation is the same, word for word practically.

If you are looking for accurate information on the this abduction case I believe you would enjoy this video. It would have been nice to see video recreations of the abduction, as well as video of the abduction sites around the White Mountains.",1368576000,3,1451,4.942622950819672

8565764,5,B00BC1UP6K,I like knowing the details.,1497398400,,27,4.6
8565765,1,B00BC1UP6K,They don't tell you in the description it is a documentary  I was expecting the actor  James Earl jones  what  a rip off,1473638400,,120,4.086956521739131
8565766,4,B00BC1UP6K,"As other reviewers say, the production of this ""documentary"" is not of the best quality. But....if you have the patience to put up with some of the flaws, I think you'll come away convinced that the Hills did not fabricate this story.
The most tedious part of this film is that when the first lecture by Betty Hill's niece, Kathleen Marden is over, it just goes right into what must be the lecture she gave the previous day where she is joined by Physicist, and UFologist, Stanton T. Friedman. It's basically a repeat of the first lecture shown........do NOT bother watching this second lecture unless you're into wasting time with repeat information.
I gave it four stars because it does present a comprehensive look at what happened to the Hills .......and even though it's from a family member, I never felt she was doing this for her own gain, but because she truly believed the Hill's story and uses the actual tapes from the hypnosis sessions so we can draw our own conclusions.",1467504000,,984,4.69364161849711

8565769,3,B00BC1UP6K,"I was familiar with the incident and thought the movie stayed pretty close to the facts.  The only problem I had with the DVD was that it's picture quality was very poor.  It was blurry and color was faded.  Other than that, I enjoyed it. T",1382918400,,240,4.173913043478261
