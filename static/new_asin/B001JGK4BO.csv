3657781,5,B001JGK4BO,"I don't know how much more I can add to the reviews on how spectacular this DVD is. When I watched it last night, it only took me about 10 minutes to realize how much I loved it! I am open to many styles of belly dance, but Egyptian is what I tend to be drawn to the most, so it's great to see a DVD that thoroughly explains this authentic Egyptian style.  One of my favourite aspects of this DVD is the live musicians.  For those of us who aren't blessed with working with a live band (Myself included) it is a real treat to watch real live musicians play the baladi music, and to see Ranya performing with them.  The beauty of it is, if I am ever lucky enough to get more opportunities to perform with live Egyptian music, this DVD will be a valuable tool in helping me learn the structure of the baladi songs, as well as the style of movement that is generally used, and tips on how to improvise.
  Ranya has a great sense of humour, and uses clearly defined explanations throughout...it almost feels like you are getting a 5 hour private lesson with her.",1245801600,2,1058,4.217821782178218
3657782,5,B001JGK4BO,"I am AMAZED by this DVD! FINALLY, a high quality product with an instructor that not only inspires but TEACHES!!! Enough of the artsy, poor quality products that I have been buying for 10 years. When I put the first DVD in to watch it yesterday I didn't really expect much...I have a closet full of videos and DVDs. But, WOW!!!! Ranya Renee should be very proud of this work.
  I actually stopped what I was doing, sat down and watched the entire set! Her dance style is very authentic...not a ""fusion"" style that is seen so often and called ""Egyptian"". And, her time and effort in going to Egypt and dancing with the people in the ""country"" style really shows! When she uses the expressions of ""flavor"" and ""coming home"" while explaining the sections of music it is evident that she really understands the passion of the ""Baladi"".
  I would LOVE to be able to purchase the music that she uses for her drills!!! To be honest, I have never really enjoyed the highly orchestrated music of the ""Egyptian "" style...but..I see it from a new perspective now. I am even willing to deal with the modern accordion!! I wish that during my dance career I might have the opportunity to dance with a full array of musicians. Until now, I have enjoined the singular dumbek..now I wnat MORE!
  I cannot recommend this DVD more highly! And,I look forward to receiving her other products...which I ordered after seeing this first offering in the ""Egyptian"" series!!!!!!",1244246400,,1452,4.65234375
3657783,5,B001JGK4BO,"The captivating beauty of Egyptian Style Baladi is presented by Ranya Rene sharing deep wealth of information with us. I have been several weeks into this program before writing this review. This program allows the veiwer to capture it in depth, as it brings the baladi to the spotlight that it well deserves.  Baladi is built from rich random music and comprised of improvisational nuances.
This program is presented in a double dvd set.

Disk One Structure and Technique
The instructor ilustrates the structure of the baladi using simple visual aides. The technique and body positions engaging the deep psoas muscle, the placement of the pelvis and ribcage where the dance style originates and returns are very well explained .

To begin, baladi is defined  as the dance of a country or the people. The parts of the baladi begin with a taxim, the slow movement danced to the accordion, a drum section called sekat, also maksoum  which follows. Here is more flowing  steady dancing often with call and answer sessions and  tempo changes. The dance includes sections for both women and men, as well as costuming. Terminology, proper framing of the arms, variations of shimmy, and maqsoum moves are placed in visual explanation.

Disk Two is an array of practice drills with improvisational demonstrations of nuances for taqsim, sekkat, maqsoum, etc. sections.  The origin of Egyptian style baladi is derived of basic belly dance  movement yet taken into a complex style. For this reason I would suggest that  perhaps the intermediate dancer will begin here with ease, especially if in search of a definite style or just to explore the vast dance spectrum.
The instructor is energetic, knowledgeable and skilled at her love of dance.  The practice sections with music and voice or music alone are always convenient. I felt that the instruction is lengthy and detailed, I found it best to dissect and execute drills in intervals of days with plenty of repetition. For the beginner with entrance skills, this would be a good practice.
The improvisational performances by Ranya very well define baladi and the freedom to flow to the music.
 Baladi is a beautiful dance; if it originates in the heart, the body will soon follow.",1239494400,,2223,4.975675675675675
3657784,5,B001JGK4BO,"DVD  has a lot of or may be all information, that you need to know, to be able to dance Baladi in a y it should be done. It's 5 hours long, but every minute is valuable. Ranya would tell about music and history. She would split Baladi by parts and types. All this is important for understanding and dancing. Each part, she would break down by appropriate moves for the music and in the second DVD from the set, she would give you plenty of drills to practice. I wanted to dance Baladi for a long time and it was to much of a challenge for me, because I could not do right interpretation and was not familiar with proper technique. Now, I started to dance it. This DVD is very useful for experienced dancers as well as for beginners. All moves and muscle work is explained in a very simple manner and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this DVD set for every dancer, who is interested in Baladi or even just in Egyptian type technique and specifics of muscles work and how to put it to movements. It has much more than dancing Baladi.",1239062400,,1039,4.247474747474747
3657785,5,B001JGK4BO,"My favorite new DVD has got to be Ranya Renee's first in a series of three DVDs on Egyptian Dance, this one on Baladi.  I have longed for a video or workshop about baladi, not just a choreography demonstration, but something that explained the essence of baladi.  Baladi, in terms of this DVD and Egyptian dance, is a specifically Egyptian dance performed to their baladi (or country) music.  Ranya explained that baladi can mean other things in the surrounding Arabic countries.  It is commonly done at weddings and parties, by both men and women, but Raks Sharki performers will often do a baladi section to their full routine.  The DVD is all I hoped for, and then some.  It is actually a two DVD set, containing 3 hours of material.
The first DVD focuses on the baladi music, and movements stylized for baladi. She spends the first 30 minutes explaining the music, with live musicians, one of whom grew up on Mohammed Ali Street in Cairo. He demonstrates on the accordion how the baladi is different in Alexandria, Upper Egypt, at a street wedding, or a nightclub. Ranya Renee also had the drummers demonstrate the different rhythms you will hear in the progression, and how they play off the accordion. She demonstrated the differences between a women's street baladi, men's street baladi, and a nightclub baladi.  Then, she demonstrates each style, in costume.
On the second half of the first DVD, she teaches techniques for each section of the baladi and demonstrates how to make them more ""baladi"" style.  The drills are separated into movements for each musical section, the taqsim (musical improvisation) that starts each baladi, then the call & response section, the maqsoum rhythm - slow and fast - and the 2-beat Ingerara.  The ingerara section (the fast section at the end of a baladi progression) was a challenge in the past for me.  I always felt like I couldn't dance that fast and didn't have enough ""fast moves"" to fill the time.  I would look for baladi progressions with a very short Ingerara.  With Ranya Renee's DVD, I am no longer limited, except my own endurance!
The technique section begins with posture and even an advanced dancer should not skip over it.  First, it is taught in a most charming way using props to demonstrate.  The use of the amusing props, such as a miniskirt to show how your muscles are tight but fluid around that area, or the zipper up the pelvis to show how you are ""zipped up"" through those muscles, brought the points home to me in a new way.  I have talked to several others about this DVD and all have remarked on this section, how it made them feel very different.  Given these postural changes - and understanding the muscle mechanics - I feel I am getting a juicier look to my abdominal isolations.
With all this in mind, she talked about framing.  She demonstrated the hows and more importantly the whys.  I was thrilled that Ranya showed that you can in fact use your arms in baladi to express the music.  I had a private lesson where I was taught not to use them as much, and I found it a little restrictive.  It is just a matter of understanding how to use the arms.  The abdominal core and hips are still the main focus of musical expression in the body.  Ranya also talked about making it personal, letting the music sing through your body.  As this music has always moved me to dance, I felt freer hearing this - I had let other people's hang-ups about what you should and shouldn't do creep into my mind until I became insecure dancing baladi.  I loved the way she described this dance as one where you feel confident in yourself, your body - proud and strong.

While the movements she teaches in the instructional section will all be very familiar - aside from a new type of ""jewel"" that I had not seen before - the student may find they feel entirely different when engaging the muscles as instructed in the postural section.  The fluid taqsim moves were quite delicious with that sense of holding and fluid tension in the core!  The ingerara section could serve as a workout in itself - Ranya has endless energy.
The second DVD focuses on improvisation, as baladi is an improvisational dance.  Ranya talks in general about improvisation in baladi, and then leads the student into drills.  There are three baladi progressions on the DVD for improvisations.  For each one, she discusses the music, danced through it twice, and then goes into the drills.  It was not clear to me if the dancing section was intended for the student to watch, follow along, or dance alone to the music.  In the drills, Ranya loops sections of the music over and over and you can follow along with her, although there is no voice instruction.  You also have the option to flow into the music and dance your own improvisation.  However, I found it instructive to ""follow the bouncing  butt"" so to speak, and follow what Ranya chose to do - to try to capture the essence of it into my own body.
In summary, this DVD is extremely economical for everything you receive with it.  I am looking forward to the next in the series - on Modern Cairo style.",1237593600,54,5093,4.595132743362832
3657786,5,B001JGK4BO,"If music and dance are the heart and soul of a country, in this 5 hour DVD 2 disc set, you will not only learn how to dance Baladi, which in Egyptian dance means ""country style,"" but also learn how it is a response to the music, which is authentic and wonderful  and explained by the musicians, getting a delightful slice of the regional culture. This is ""down home"" dancing, the way Egyptians dance in their homes and the streets of their neighborhoods.  This doesn't mean that it is easy to learn, as it is subtle and  improvisational, but Ranya Renee shows us the fine art of it. Voluptuous and beautiful, with a fabulous mane of red hair, Ranya is a gorgeous dancer, and a superb teacher.

Disc 1 has an in-depth explanation of the music, and several marvelous performances which are a pleasure to listen to and watch. The musicians are:
Maurice Chedid, oud
Nebawy, accordion
Mohamed Abdullah, violin
Beshai, qanun/nay
Mohamed Yhya, tabla
Said Fahmy, doff/riqq
It continues with Ranya giving instruction on the basic technique, terminology, positions, posture, use of muscles, using some good ""visuals"" (like a zipper) to drive her points home and make them memorable.

Disc 2 has Ranya explaining improvisation and how to go about it, and has numerous practice drills for every rhythm, danced just with music, no verbal instruction. Practice, practice, practice! This is done in a bare and brightly lit dance studio, and every movement is easy to see.  This ""Belly Dance Egyptian Style"" DVD is a terrific introduction to the newcomer to belly dance from Egypt, and an excellent ""tune up"" for the seasoned dancer.",1237248000,3,1617,4.861818181818182
3657787,5,B001JGK4BO,"Belly Dance Egyptian Style the Baladi

Intermediate/advanced

This is a 2 dvd set; the first 135 minutes, the second 170 minutes

Ranya covers an explanation of the music and the rhythms of Baladi and the different styles of Baladi music, then on to the dance.
This is in a ""follow along"" style.  You need some familiarity with moves, as there is no extensive break-down of the moves.
The posture section is very amusing!  Ranya Rene'e is a hoot!  I'm looking forward to the rest of the Egyptian Style series.  There is a nice section on framing  and a section on arm paths.
The second dvd is your Improvisation and drill dvd.  This will help you work on improv  and give you several drills to work with, or, if you have the stamina, a couple hours of dance practice.
This video really leads you into the music and encourages and helps you learn to relax and do your improvisational dance.  If you need help on improv, you want to get this video.  There is a nice section in which Ranya encourages you to dance with her for a bit, then improv on your own with your back to the screen.

The company that puts out these videos keeps getting better and better.  I love the quality of their videos and the fact that they have listened to dancers and what dancers want in an instuctional video, and what they want in a performance video.",1236211200,21,1332,4.42798353909465
3657788,5,B001JGK4BO,"My wife knows the instructor, so I got to see a preview copy of the DVD. I teach W. African drum and dance and am NOT a belly dancer myself. So consider that as you read on...

I was impressed by several things about this 2-DVD set:

1) The production values were outstanding. They shot on HD, and did a great job with lighting, sound, and editing. That makes it very easy to watch and absorb.

2) The instruction is tremendously detailed. I was surprised by how in-depth Ranya went into the cultural nuance of the movement and music, so it has great appeal to beginners and more advanced dancers.

3) The musicians are world class, so you will be dancing to traditional music done by people who care a great deal about the authenticity of their art form.

I've been involved in teaching traditional W. African music and dance for 17 years, and had a career in video production, so I've got high standards for this kind of project.

Luckily for belly dance students around the globe, the instructor and producers also have high standards, and have turned out a DVD worth serious study.

3657789,5,B001JGK4BO,I have had the opportunity to take her workshops in New York and she is an awesome instructor and beautiful to watch. This video and her others will inspire you and teach you the true culture,1411084800,,191,4.333333333333333
3657790,5,B001JGK4BO,"I am very pleased with this purchase as the instructor touches upon all aspects that are necessary in order to understand this style: she explains characteristics of baladi music, commonly used rhythms, she reviews correct bellydance technique and posture, explains the ""feel"" of the dance and how it differs from other oriental styles, and she gives very useful advice and drills to help develop improvisation. And of course, she gives some beautiful performance, as well.

Beginners should beware that a fair understanding and mastering of the basic technique is expected. This is in not really a DVD that will teach ""basic steps"" or offer lots of drills that improve technique. It focuses more on baladi movement vocabulary and would probably be more suitable for an intermediate and advanced student.

In any case, it is a very useful tool for a dancer. I found it very educational and pleasant to watch even as a documentary-style film on baladi.",1398124800,,951,5.050955414012739
3657791,5,B001JGK4BO,"I love all of Ranya Renee's videos, and this one is truly great! She is so knowledgeable about music, culture and language as well as the dance, that she really gives you a multi-dimensional understanding of the subject.

3657793,5,B001JGK4BO,"This DVD is really well made and provides a thorough look at Baladi. Ranya is great explaining in great detail the nuances and different styles, musicality and performance styles of the Baladi. She also shows the moves thst would be appropriate for each musical accompaniment. The musicians are wonderful and some of them offer valuable insight in the art of Baladi dance. She also talks about which costumes would be more appropriate for which music and how to include it in your performances. If you are a beginner (or even an advanced belly dancer) this DVD could be a little overwhelming because there are a lot of things thrown at you. Luckily, this DVD is well formatted and edited so that you can go back to sections. The DVD is good quality and pleasant to watch unlike so many new ones that are just a by-product of star dancers. Ranya's discussions are solid, informative and will benefit anyone looking to delve deeper into Baladi.",1378771200,,942,4.75
3657794,5,B001JGK4BO,"I don't use this enough - but it is really good - it has given me a lot more confidence in improvising dance.
Very cleverly put together - deceptively simple.  But Ranya explains the structure of baladi very well, and gives very good examples of how to use the music.
The drills are very useful.

Found out baladi was what I wanted, and many on other sites recommended this DVD set. THIS was a gamble that paid off. Her breakdowns are clear - and silly-fun at times. Her segments on the music are wonderful. She shows you the component parts she uses, explains how to listen to the music so it guides you, then shows you how to apply various techniques to the music, and provides sections so you can either follow her suggestions, or concoct combos of your own. This is one of my top-ranked favorites, right out of the gate!",1353715200,,687,4.504
3657799,5,B001JGK4BO,This dvd is probably one of the most often viewed videos in my collection.

The practice section has been the most valuable teaching tool. I have learned so much more from this dvd than any of the others.,1353715200,,342,4.359375
3657800,5,B001JGK4BO,"I had the opposite opinion of the person named ""LaLa"" who wrote a review. This is definitely for advanced dancers, as it tackles the inner rhythms and styles of baladi, which is what you get into after really studying the dance and needing to get beyond basic moves and rhythms, and are looking for more than just a great choreography DVD, trying to get to REALLY know the music. I would not recommend it for beginners, as it is assumed you know a certain level about music and dance based on the content. I REALLY love this DVD and will consider it a valuable resource, and I believe it would leave beginners with too many questions.",1330905600,3,634,4.474137931034483

3657802,5,B001JGK4BO,"I read the reviews and found that it was very helpful in making my decision whether this DVD would be beneficial to me.  I received this DVD yesterday and was really pleased.  I think Ranya is a very good teacher and she does a great job explaining why posture is important and takes you through a nice warm up before choreography.  I enjoy how she repeats sections in the choreography a few times to let you get the sense of it and then shows that section of an actual performance.  She has a great grasp on the complexity of middle eastern music and does a great job explaining how it is constructed and therefore, how the dance enhances and is enhanced by it.  I am an intermediate/advanced dancer and teacher myself and feel strong about having a good understanding of body mechanics, posture and music awareness.  I enjoy an interchange of encouragement by experiencing other dancers teaching techniques.  There is something about this DVD that is special and I think it is Ranya herself.

This is the one dvd that I own that is still teaching me. I watch it a few times a year. I always learn something new every time I watch it. It is full of so much information and so many tips for dancers. As a beginner, this video flew straight over my head in its entirety, but I learned what a baladi was, even if I didn't understand her detailed breakdown. Coming back to the DVD at a later point in time, I was able to understand a little more and a little more. My point is, she gives you so much information that this DVD will be valuable to you for years to come.

3657806,1,B001JGK4BO,"This is more of a chat, with music, by a pretty out of shape lady wearing shockingly bad outfits.  I was 50 minutes into the DVD before any dance instruction was even hinted at.  Maybe for beginners the overview is great, but I wasn't interested in history or musical style distinctions, I was looking for an excersize DVD that would help me stay on course when I cannot make it to classes.  This was pretty disappointing, because it was supposed to be intermediate/advanced.  It's definitely beginner level, mostly introductory technique.  There just isn't enough to justify purchasing the disc.  You will only listen to all the chit chat once, if that.  Which will leave you with significantly smaller time for actual work.  I was not impressed by the style or skill level of the instructor.  I am in classes with women of a similar skill level and they would not presume to call themselves instructors.  She is more of a Middle Eastern restaurant dancer - she can do a few basics, but certainly doesn't exert herself.  Also - the clothing choices are so awful as to be distracting.  And in belly dance there are certainly lots of bad outfits, so this is saying something!  Maybe she should concentrate on dancing halidja in abaya instead of the Egyptian style she is doing.",1302825600,3,1276,4.719457013574661

I love love love this DVD,1260921600,,367,4.333333333333333
3657815,5,B001JGK4BO,"Not only is this 2 DVD set chock full of information, Ranya is absolutely hysterical in her descriptions of how to do things.  She makes it so much fun!  I really enjoy her easy going teaching style while getting across very key Egyptian style concepts.  This DVD is an excellent value for the price!",1257206400,,300,4.518518518518518
3657816,5,B001JGK4BO,"This is a fantastic beledi workshop in two DVD's.  Lovely production values, technical knowledge of the dance, a dash of theory (so I now know which part of a beledi I'm listening to!), and as for the second DVD - this is a treasure!
The first DVD shows technique, theory and some of the movement vocabulary useful in beledi dance.  Don't miss the posture section - it's not only a real laugh, it's got some excellent imagery that makes an enormous difference to movements.
The second is my absolute favourite: sections of beledi that are looped to allow you to go over and over pieces until they hit your muscle memory - with options to go right through the whole piece, or have a voice-over, or play each section without a voice-over.  I particularly enjoy being able to put it on and just move, while becoming familiar not only with that piece of music, but how my body responds to it.  it's true, too, that when you get 'tired' it's from then on that REAL improvisation starts to happen.
I'm not sure of all the information in this DVD, one person I respect suggests that it's a fairly 'North American' interpretation of just a couple of beledi styles - whatever it is, I've so enjoyed this set that I'm sure I'm just about wearing the finish off it!  Definitely worth buying.",1256428800,2,1280,4.523809523809524
3657817,5,B001JGK4BO,"As there are here a lot of detailed reviews very well explained, I just want to share my general feeling about this DVD.
It's not a simple DVD who teaches you a baladi choreography.
It's a real tool in order to introduce you to the wonderful world of the Egyptian Baladi.
I'm impressed by the amount of material covered on this 2 set DVD.
The first DVD (135 minutes): Baladi structure & Core Egyptian Technique
The second DVD (170 minutes): Improvisational Practice Drills
Before dancing to a baladi music, you have to understand the concept and the structure of this style of music, and Ranya Rene did here a great job; she gives you the opportunity to understand what is the Baladi, its keys, the connexion between the instrument and the different parts of your body, how to feel the music in order to dance your own interpretation.
This DVD is really unique.
She explains along with musicians the different musical components of the Baladi with its progression and also the various style of Baladi.
Then following these different parts, she teaches you the various appropriated dance movements, with a lot of tips on posture, muscles used, the feeling, how to connect the movements with the music and how to interpret it.
Then you will drill improvisation with her on the second DVD and you can put into practice what you have learned on the first DVD in order to make your own interpretation.
This DVD is very well constructed; explanations are clear, and with the WDNY high quality DVD production.
Don't miss the opportunity to learn and enjoy the essence of Baladi.

3657818,5,B001JGK4BO,"I do like this DVD, despite I always prefer tribal fusion. I like it most about the posture thing. Ranya spends over 10 minutes in explaining posture and alignment, which I think already worths the whole DVD's price (although not a lot for 5 hours' lessons in a 2-DVD sets). Imagine you have to pee and hold it, this is the way to dance, it helps you feel grounded to the floor, gives a saucy twist to the moves. My Goodness! Aren't we talking of the same thing all the time? The chi in Chinese Kung Fu, the hole just a few inches below the belly button, the K exercise for strong inner muscle recommended by doctors,....all boiled down to the special lower abdomen strength.....then Ranya put a soft ball between her thighs to show the pulling in of the inner thighs, also a red spandex to pull butts inwards.............., to contain everything together.....like inside a cylinder! Oh, I forgot the zip that she stuck to her lower garment. Imagine a zip in the muscles at the middle front of the hips, yes, zip the muscles in ..And she put on a beautiful pink bra to show us how to open up the chest (breathe in first), & the back but at the same time keep the back muscles engaged as if being held by the bra straps....and with everything lift up (by pulling of the upper body uuuuuuuuup including the hands and then putting the hands down) so to create a space between upper body and lower body, so that movements become more fluid.....I wish I can spell out as clearly and interestingly as she does in the DVD..but it does open up my eyes...once I practise what she teaches, mine! My stomach naturally sinks in and my legs become firmer (I just ordered a ballet conditioning workout to help strengthening my lower abdomen, now I know I don't really need it.)!

No other belly dancers had told me the above, or as interestingly and in such great details as she does, which makes the DVD stand out. I have just told R, my son, that we need to have characters or to stand out amongst a group of persons. Like Tiramisu, the brandy makes it stand out, or chocolate orange mousse cake sold at Conrad, the orange peel makes it stand out....but not any ordinary cake with sugar, white flour, cream and butter (or even not butter but transfat) but no characteristics. In addition, the dancer is very sexy in her body language, including how she speaks, moves, pauses and dances .....so yes, this is a wonderful DVD!

In addition, she dances with live musicians too! With very sexy (feminine, I mean) moves,...very different from my favouite belly dance - tribal fusion (sort of modern)...I consider it is a must for my belly dance library. In any event, the posture thing is worth every penny of it!",1247961600,4,2695,4.50920245398773

8312847,1,B001JGK4BO,"I wish I could get my money back. It's a ton of time just talking for 1 minute about this move, 1 minute about that move. Then a ton of time before you ever really learn anything beyond that talking about this instrument and that. You don't learn any real coordinated belly dancing from this. And she is always talking in the background so it is very awkward to follow an exercise video in this format. Hate it.",1472083200,,411,4.282051282051282
