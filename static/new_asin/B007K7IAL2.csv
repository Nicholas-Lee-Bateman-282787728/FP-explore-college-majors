8518779,2,B007K7IAL2,"Well, if you're into small ensemble (3 character) acting you might find this tolerable. But know that it's basically a filmed stage play on one set (a rather dark basement), so you have to really like getting into actors' heads. It includes kidnapping negotiations, troubled masturbation and a botched abortion. There are no funny lines or scintillating sophisticated dialogue. It's verbal revelations of three twenty-something small-town folks caught in a steadily devolving whirlpool of bad choices. It's kind of believable but it's definitely not going to cheer you up... so now you're forewarned.",1457222400,,600,5.462365591397849
8518780,4,B007K7IAL2,"I started watching The Wages Of Sin because I wanted to watch something that wasn't big budget and I had basically exhausted my other choices,I never thought it would capture my attention so fast and keep me glued to the screen as it did.
The players which included only 3 actors were all good but the stand out by far was Lauren Martin who portrayed the character of Celee. The film is about a kidnapping that unravels so many secrets and a couple of OMG moments plus it takes us to places that I would never have imagined us going in this little kidnapping for ransom film.
It is not action packed and there is no gore although there is blood so if you are looking for a slasher flick look elsewhere but if you like smart dialogue and a cat and mouse of wits so to speak I most highly recommend this film.",1366502400,2,807,4.246753246753247
8518781,5,B007K7IAL2,"If you like thrillers, I highly recommend Wages of Sin. It starts off easy like the southern summer day where it begins. Then the young couple's mistakes begin to compound, creating consequences more dire and acts more desperate until... (no spoiler here!). Wages of Sin is terrific across-the-board. A good story, excellent acting, and a well-crafted production combine to create a memorable and disquieting movie. Excellent job Little Dog Productions, I'm looking forward to your next one.",1341360000,,491,5.3896103896103895
8518782,4,B007K7IAL2,"A short way into the movie, while trying to figure out where the plot was going, I got hooked on the characters and felt compelled to see where they would take me.  The surprise ending was out of nowhere but yet believable.  The acting, writing and directing were all<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wages-Of-Sin/dp/B007K7IAL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wages Of Sin</a>&nbsp;quite good and paid off in the end.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful yarn.",1341187200,2,520,6.095890410958904
8518783,5,B007K7IAL2,"This little film was a great thriller with a shocking ending! The acting was great, and the film was shot very well. I highly recommend it!",1341187200,,139,4.384615384615385
8518784,5,B007K7IAL2,"Wages of Sin is a small film with a shocking ending. The plot started a little slow and I thought I would get bored, but that was what sucked me in. You start off thinking these people must be pretty stupid to do things the way they did them, but by the end, you can't believe what they did. Great script, which will have you thinking about this film for the next week. Great acting too! Little Dog Productions (who produced, wrote and directed this) has got a BIG bark! I'm glad I bought it! I can't wait to see more by these guys!",1340150400,,532,4.125
8518785,4,B007K7IAL2,Great little surprise of a film... Bought it on a whim as I enjoy finding unknown movies. I wasn't expecting much but thoroughly enjoyed it. The actors were good and it looked great. I recommend it.,1339632000,,198,4.527777777777778
8518786,5,B007K7IAL2,"WAGES OF SIN seemed like a little movie when I first watched it -- not a lot of locations, small cast... but it really grabbed me.  The acting is great.  It's beautifully shot... and it has a lot of surprises.  I would highly recommend this intense little film",1338076800,,260,4.375
