8533812,4,B00916UEXM,"Ki Ho Tae is a tough guy and a former gangster with a warm heart. He betrays the gang and has to go into hiding. He comes to find himself living at and working as a part-time employee at a traditional restaurant, called Heaven, Earth, and Man, that makes all kinds of kimchi. Lee Kang Sun, who's upbeat and hot-tempered, runs the restaurant with the rest of her family and friends after her father disappears to find a boy from their past. That boy just happens to be Ho Tae. Although, the family doesn't know that her father is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. As Lee Kang Sun and the others learn to run the restaurant on their own, they honor the family traditions of kimchi making and keep the restaurant a happy place for customers to return to. After all, good kimchi can comfort the soul of anyone and give hope to those who need it.

There is more to the story than just food though. The owner of a large chain restaurant has set its sights on Heaven, Earth, and Man and will try anything to take it. But the owner is connected to Ho Tae. His past and secrets of his life are also being revealed little by little. Gangsters are still searching for Ho Tae and causing many other problems. They also have many quirky people with troubles of their own that frequent the restaurant. Even some complicated love starts to develop between characters.

There is so much going on in this drama that makes it very entertaining. It's a comforting and heartwarming show about food, family and love, with a little bit of darkness, mystery, and action-packed fighting added in. Though it can be sad and dark at times, there is many likable and funny characters in a story full of twists and turns. (24 episodes)",1390089600,,1708,4.471153846153846
8533813,5,B00916UEXM,"Just finished watching the 24 episodes last night - this is a positive modern  family show dealing with an incredible showcase of  different korean kimchee in the midst of family drama.  There is a family of an ""uncle"", 2 daughters and a father who run a traditional Korean restaurant Chung Ji In (Heaven Earth Man restaurant) in a gorgeous traditional home setting in the mountains with financial problems. One day a young gangster (Song Il Gook) beaten up and bloodied is brought to their home and says ""I'm hungry"". He is put to work as one of their chefs.  The story commences with the sudden disappearance of their father (who is in search of someone he believes he has wronged) who has left no note but sends boxes of vegetables periodically  which reassures the family, the machinations of a giant food company that wants to take over the picturesque restaurant, the local gangster group looking for Song Il Gook (known as Gi Ho Tae  ""Quixote"")and the proud, cold Chairman of the giant Food company.
I really liked this drama for several reasons - the stars and actresses of course, but also because the story line is so achingly sweet and there is a happy ending that ties neatly. There are some Korean dramas that have a bittersweet ending - Soulmate, Winter Sonata,Song of the Prince, Hwang Jini,(loved all of these by the way) but this one ends mostly good for most of the characters.  Alzheimers is dealt with, and the cast of characters include a little girl abandoned by her mother, a traditional doctor of oriental medicine, a son who has never been smiled at by his cold mother (we later find out why), a young gangster who grows up obsessed with finding out about the death of his beloved father who died when he was 8 or so, a ""goblin"" who kidnaps directors, a detective team of two following a case of 8 years ago.  There is a surprise twist to many characters as the show goes on, but the show is held entirely by the love between the family members for each other.  Very very warm and wonderful show.  This is a keeper! I don't know about the subtitle quality on this version selling on Amazon so please beware of the quality of the subtitling first.  The",1361059200,,2176,4.5681233933161955
