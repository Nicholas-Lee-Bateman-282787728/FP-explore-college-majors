7949101,5,B00005OOPY,This gives you a look at how this show has been edited to make it suitable for younger audiences.  The music from battle of the planets makes it more dramatic and enjoyable.  The music is missing from the G Force edit.  The original cartoon is too violent for younger kids hence Battle of the planets.,1399334400,,301,4.4363636363636365
7949102,1,B00005OOPY,"the edition of this dvd is really disappointing, beside the content of the dvd's is very poor and non-attractive.... a pitty that they didn't make a better edition for such a good tv animation serie. Let's hope they make it better next time.",1252713600,,241,4.627906976744186
7949103,3,B00005OOPY,"Lots of other reviews here do an excellent job covering the content of this DVD.  I just wanted to mention that there is a slight technical problem with this DVD (and the rest of vols. 1-4).  The English language track on the G-Force episode is virtually inaudible, which is a real disappointment and knocked the DVD down a star.  I tried on two different players (Pioneer DV-626D and Playstation 2), and they both have the same trouble.  I even wrote in to Rhino's technical support and they kindly exchanged the discs for me, but sadly, the replacement discs are the same way.  I just wanted to put out the warning here.  The rest of the disc is fine and has great content - it's just that one problematic audio track.",1086652800,,720,4.5
7949104,4,B00005OOPY,This is one of my favorite tv series from the 70's and 80's. I was so happy to hear this was finally coming out. The only thing i was disappointed with was there's only six of these and there's not my on the way of dvd features. But the eposodes themselves make up for the lack of extras. give it a look.,1062288000,,304,3.9193548387096775
7949105,4,B00005OOPY,"OK, I'll admit it -- when I picked up volume 2 of Battle of the Planets, I was hoping that the annoying brat in ""The Space Mummy"" suffered a less kind fate in ""The Giant Mummy That Calls Storms"".
Seriously though, it wasn't an old-fashioned Godzilla-style stomping that I was looking for; I was looking forward to watching the sanitized U.S. versions of the show and then comparing those episodes to their corresponding stories in the original Japanese. (For the uninitiated, Battle of the Planets was a very loosely translated version of Science Ninja Team Gatchaman. The latter was an edgy, groundbreaking anime that didn't feature any cutesy robots.)
Now that Rhinomation has gotten me watching Gatchaman again, I can't stop. I hope they won't confine themselves to releasing the 85-episode run of Battle of the Planets episodes; after all, they don't cover the entire run of Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, which ran 105 episodes.
Can you imagine if a publisher decided to print only 85 pages of a 105-page book? And in the missing 20 pages were some of the best parts of the story as well as the ending? I'm very much hoping that Rhinomation doesn't force us to ask those questions.
Come on fans, don't settle for anything less than the whole series! There are 105 episodes to be seen so tell Rhino (or its parent company, Time Life Warner) that you want to see them all!",1015200000,5,1374,4.729166666666667
7949106,3,B00005OOPY,"The second volume of Battle of The Planets, a classic Japanese cartoon that appeared on American television in the late 70's and early 80's.  The G-Force is five teenagers who don bird costumes and fight evil.  There major weapon is the ability to join together and form a fiery Phoenix.  The cartoon has some cool animation and storylines, but the fact they only put two episodes per DVD is fairly weak.",1010707200,,404,4.661971830985915
