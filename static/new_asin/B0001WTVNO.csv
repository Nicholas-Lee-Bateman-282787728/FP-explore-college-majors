8017020,3,B0001WTVNO,"When BCI's COLD STEEL HOT LEAD 4 Movie Pack was released in 2004, it was touted as a celebration of the independent film maker. Being a ""maverick"" brings with it the freedom to create, unhampered by interference from above. On the other hand, a lack of polish in the finished product is all too common a result without studio guidance and money. It's up to the viewer to decide if in the end the trade-off was worth it.

CONTENTS:

THE GHOST-- A mobster on the verge of taking over a drug cartel is plagued by a heavily armed man (the Ghost) seeking revenge for his murdered wife and missing son.

THE MAD BOMBER-- Directed by cheap-o monster movie maker Bert I. Gordon. This is a story of revenge through dynamite. Chuck Connors portrays a man spiralling into insanity after the death of his daughter and divorce. To get back at those he blames his misfortunes on the ""Mad Bomber"" bombs.... madly.....

A PACKING SUBURBIA-- Teen living in a bad Long Island neighborhood refuses to join a local gang and his girlfriend is murdered as a result. Seeking revenge, the boy gets a pistol and learns how to use it over the internet. Very amateurish-looking movie.

SPREE-- The van carrying a group partying teens crashes in the desert. While walking for help the kids come across the camp of some drug dealers who aren't at all pleased to see them.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
