7859385,2,6304001339,"Why do they keep making these films?  Plot Summary for ALL Witchcraft movies.  Hot girls are introduced early on.  Then the ""magic user"" shows up.  This person is either a shirtless stud or a female acquaintence (like a neighbor or tour guide).  The ""magic user"" is always trying to free a demon or possess a unborn baby.  The director pumps a bunch of fake smoke around the set and then they roll the credits.  Kinda like a softcore porn with some fangs.  The End.

7859386,3,6304001339,"Basically the only people who are going to watch this movie are those who are already into watching the series. Once again its a paper thin plot with lots of nudity and sex thrown in to keep the viewer interested. If you are a fan of cheesy horror flicks then this is for you. I recomend the whole series if you can find them and actually sit through them. Basic plot. A ancient witch was burned and burried and sealed in a tomb. A new teacher moves into the salem area and finds a secret room in his basement that is, guess what, the ancient tomb. A relic is removed and the witch is set free to wreak havok and make this guys life hell. and thats about it.",991785600,3,658,4.108527131782946
