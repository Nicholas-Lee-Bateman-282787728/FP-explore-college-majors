2261918,1,B000935TVI,"Sorry, but this SIEGFRIED is a total failure. Well near-total: Hermann Becht is very good as Alberich. He really feels the role and makes his voice appropriately ugly.

The rest of the cast is awful.  Even Heinz Zednik is too splayed and all-over-the-place as Mime.  Like the Scarecrow in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  He's much better later under James Levine.

Particularly poor are Manfred Jung in the title role, Donald McIntyre (surprisingly) as the Wanderer, and Fritz Hubner as Fafner, who sounds choked and artificially wooly, like he's been doing bong hits or something.  Jones fully lives up to her reputation for wayward pitch and inconsistant tone.

Except for DAS RHEINGOLD, this whole RING flops, not because of the controvercial (at the time)  staging but because of poor singing and acting by the cast. It's surprising, because the RHEINGOLD is fantastic, with some of the same cast--Donald the Big Mac is fine as young Wotan, expressive but cool under pressure; Zednik's just brilliant as Loge, Becht does a world-class sympathetic Alberich.  Young Matti Salminen crowns the performance, making Fasolt into a main character.

The GDAM is unwatchable. It's in the running for worst Wagner I've ever seen.  All three principles--Jung, Hubner, and Jones--absolutely suck.  Plus, Franz Mazura, usually one of my favorites, ruins Gunther by trying to make me feel sorry for him.",1229904000,,1379,5.134529147982063
2261919,5,B000935TVI,"I will not say anything about the music and Wagner's art. I have commented upon that when I reviewed the same recording but in the CD format. I will insist here on the video side of the recording. Since it is a live recording done in 1980, the DVD is the digitalization and re-mastering of the archive probably one camera recording of the production at the time. This of course makes it rather static because the video-director decided to use the 3D processing he could use in 2005 with moderation. I would say that was a wise decision. Siegfried by Wagner is not The Matrix or Star Wars. We can really have a feeling of what happened in 1980 due to the only shooting point that was frontal and that was kept in this DVD, more or less. Boulez and Chreau chose to make the opera a very dark tale. It all happens in dark forests, in the night, in a dark smithy, in a dark cave, in some dark castle, etc. All the characters are dressed in very uniformly brown or grey or black clothes. They all have the same kind of attire, long coats, except Siegfried, And the two women are dressed in vast robes that are shapeless and colorless. It is a tale of the night, a tale of the darkness depth of the mind that is awakening to the final scene of daybreak and daylight. The second choice was to make the singers really act their parts. That was not always easy but they were chosen for that and they all tried even if they were a little stiff at times, like Siegfried himself, whereas Mime is a lot more flexible. On this choice of the actors-singers we can regret, but that was quite difficult to do otherwise in 1980, that Siegfried is not even close to his real age which is supposed to be 15. He is at least three times that age and it shows. In the same way the Walkyrie, Brnnhilde is not exactly the age she should be in the story and her German is not as good as that of the others singers. She is not German obviously and has some problems with her vowels. But all together Boulez and Chreau managed to get a pretty nice result, particularly in 1980 in Bayreuth. The third choice was to make things rather simple. The smithy and the hearth are both stylized and simplified. They are symbolical of what they are. In the same way the bird is nicely alive in a cage rather than on the branch and stuffed with straw. The dragon is on a chariot moved around by four or more stage operators, just a big hardly articulated prop that is replaced by a man when he is finally stabbed by Siegfried. We will say that is very symbolical or metaphorical but after all that's what the theater, operatic or dramatic alike, is all about: illusion and make believe or just the suspension of our disbelief with our eyes wide shut. The best part of this production is the effort to direct the actors as actors and to introduce in the acting enough expression to provide a meaning that is not obvious in the text nor in the music. The teenage rebellious mood Siegfried demonstrates against Mime is essentially made visible on top of the meaning of the words and music, even if Siegfried's music is quite vivacious in those moments as compared to that of Mime. That is one example. Another is right at the end when Siegfried and Brnnhilde come together in a love movement and fall on their knees, one facing the other. Three attempts of a kiss are made, two that abort and a third one that becomes an embrace. Nowhere in the text or the stage directions it is said there should be three attempts or even a kiss, even if the last two lines are sung in uni son. Not only is the number particularly important and meaningful, but it is done in an absolutely convincing way that shows how Brnnhilde resists the idea, the appeal, because she considers herself as having been violated in a way, and yet she yields to the three calls from Siegfried a little earlier in this scene: ""Sei mein! Sei mein! Sei mein!"" It is such elements that turn this production into a very lively show that we will never see again since it is the property of Bayreuth and apparently they did not like it at the time, and what's more most of the singers are today beyond reprieve.

2261920,4,B000935TVI,"This is Chereau's production of ""Siegfried,"" on DVD.  While I do not always accept his scenic vision, I always find it interesting. For instance, the large wheel in the opening scene. As others, I find ""Siegfried"" the least of the four operas in ""The Ring,"" although I think that its best scenes are among the best in the entire Ring. I like the beginning of each opera, with the ""drive"" up the road to the Bayreuth Theater.

Siegfried is childlike--almost annoyingly so.  But Manfred Jung sings it dead on, as the character was conceived by Richard Wagner. He sings credibly. Some of the top scenes--the Wanderer (Wotan, sung capably by Donald McIntyre) bantering with Mime (sung excellently by Heinz Zednik, who was great also as Loge in ""Das Rheingold""); the powerful and well sung ""Forging Scene,"" in which Siegfried reconstructs his father's sword, itself having been broken by Wotan in ""Die Walkure""; ""Forest Murmurs""; Norma Sharp's brief but effective singing of the ""Woodbird""; the encounter between the Wanderer and Siegfried, with the Wanderer bested this time--unlike the case with Siegfried's father; Siegfried's awakening of Brunnhilde, who is competently sung by Gwyneth Jones.

The childlike, self-absorbed quality of Siegfried can be disturbing and off putting (e.g., his dispatching of Mime and Fafner); however, it is the character.  This version is interesting for several reasons: Chereau's production vision; Boulez's very nice conducting of the Bayreuth Orchestra; generally solid singing (Jung isn't Melchior and Jones isn't Nilsson or Traubel, although they are capable in their respective roles).  This is one of the better versions of ""Siegfried"" that is available.",1194739200,,1691,5.338345864661654
2261921,2,B000935TVI,"What have Michael Schulz, Renee Listerdal and Dirk Becker done?  I had high hopes for a modernized staging of the end of the Ring Cycle, since I have only the Met's wonderful production from years ago on DVD.  This set and costumes visually turns the opera into the equivalent of a cheap, low-budget, hole in the wall production.  Fortunately, the orchestra under Carl St. Clair plays very well and most singers, particularly the three leads, are very good (many of the secondary singers are not up to par).  The efforts of the leading singers, however, are nearly lost to this short-sighted concept.  Modern opera directors often have brilliant ideas, but there were none here.  Sorry, guys, this was a design and direction failure, not a good recipe for a DVD.",1327708800,,762,4.823076923076923
2261922,5,B000935TVI,"Many have said it better than I can,Jennifer Wilson is FANTASTIC- she should be a lot better know than she is. Her voice is mighty and clean and to my ears a great Brunhilde. Bravo to this magnificent cast and maestro Mehta.",1309305600,,224,4.357142857142857
2261923,5,B000935TVI,"The more I watch this production from Valencia, Spain, the more I like it.  The conducting by Zubin Mehta is very slow but also very detailed.  And the engineers have captured it all in superb sound.  All the singing is first rate, especially the astoundingly beautiful soprano of Brunnhilde.  The acting is also well done.  And the concept, while quite startling, is intelligent and would I think find Wagner's approval.

Visually this production is utterly a knockout.  I have never liked projections much, but here they are about three quantum leaps ahead technically of anything I've seen.  Often quite beautiful, they are almost always a major player, and they play their  part very well indeed.  The inspired concept plays interestingly with putting much of the setting in cavemen times, yet the house of Hagen is rather modern/corporate and appropriately sterile and scheming.  Sexy, caveman Siegfied enters that world, is forced to take a shower (he smells!), and emerges from the shower as the man in the grey flannel suit...totally sexless.  Really interesting.

I highly recommend the whole Ring in this production.",1293840000,,1126,5.154696132596685
2261924,4,B000935TVI,"Well I cant fault the sound, the orchestra, the lead singers, and the conducting.  All excellent but I still prefer the Furtwangler to the Solti version....and the Karajan to this.  The old Suthaus/Flagstad/Furtwangler version is how Wagner should be interpreted.

However, no-one should take the staging or the plot for this as other than silly.  I know that we are supposed to be, Oh, so refined to see deep underlying philosophical meaning to Der KunstWerke but personally I think it is total nonsense.  And the staging on this DVD version illustrates this taken to an absurd extreme. It is impossible to take it seriously, and  it justly merits the derision of my teenage children as to what on earth is Dad watching.  It is Circe Soleil or worse.....floating around on trapezes against TV background images.

I would much prefer the boring traditional staging.  If Wagner had depended on the music drama for anything other than the music itself, he would have disappeared into obscurity long ago.  Dont get this for the Blu Ray (picture quality excellent) but the best advice is to turn off the visuals and just listen to the sound.",1280275200,6,1137,4.875
2261925,4,B000935TVI,"I was doubtful about this before watching, how on earth could these Spaniards, with no significant Wagner history, keep it up. I had had reservations over the visual casting of Brnnhilde in both Walkre and Siegfried and just felt this last gigantic conclusion might prove a bit too much. I need not have worried! In fact Brnnhilde was one of the two highlights of the event. Her mighty physique and non nubile appearance may have been of some concern in the earlier parts but not here. As a weary and worldly wise Walkyrie preparing for the doom laden inferno her power and gutsy determination to see it through was an asset. Her scene with the equally aging Waltraute was magnificent. Two over the hill maidens perhaps but they were NOT going to be outdone by Hagen! The other tour de force was Matti Salminen as the evil Hagen. His scene with Alberich was particularly well done. The Rhein daughters were their ever sexy selves and the rest of the cast were all up to the mark.

I did not care very much for the stockbroker suits of the Gibichungs although Hagen's make-up was particularly stunning. More like a Yakuza gangster or an up to no good Oyakata than a Shanghai stockbroker in my view! The special effects were similar in style to the earlier dramas and even if they could not quite match the jaw-dropping impression made by Rheingold they were still pretty good. Again I felt the orchestra and Mehta struggled to deliver that last punch but aided by a splendid recording they were more than adequate. I did not care for the way Siegfied's funeral march was handled - too much of Mehta - but that is just a personal view.

As a set this Ring is remarkable and the bar has been lifted to unforseen heights for any future Blu-ray Rings. I watched this Gtterdmmerung straight through, something I have never done before and felt very satisfied at the end. Overall this is by far the best overall Ring set on video disc and can be highly reccommended. If only Blu-ray had been around when Solti did his Ring and just think what Wagner would have demanded!",1273276800,10,2063,4.572972972972973

The last, cataclysmic installment of Wagner's monumental Ring from Weimar is very much a vision of the director, Michael Schultz. His strong philosophy is most manifest here where his pessimistic views are aided by the apocalyptic story. ""There are tears in the world/as though God had died..."" The grief is never ending.

To the cruelty and murder so prevalent in the drama the director adds his own issues: cruelty to women and even to defenseless animals. The 2nd act turns into a pandemonium of mass rape by the Gibichung thugs (reminding us of British soccer hooligans). Brunnhilde's horse, Grane is portrayed by a wonderful pantomime actress with flowing white hair much abused throughout by Hagen and the adolescents also added to the production. The Director believes that children of the world are cast out, helpless therefore alienated and aggressive. They witness all major turn of events but unable to participate and move around in curiosity, with blood-stained hands.

Difficult to describe this theatrical experience with words, one really has to see how powerfully it's handled by sparse visual means. . Stage background is black throughout; there are virtually no sets and lighting pays a prominent role.

I recommend for anyone to read the very intelligent and detailed program notes where Schultz explains his viewpoint for the production.

Young American conductor, St. Clair keeps tight control and never lets the tension sag . The cast is very strong.

2261928,5,B000935TVI,"I just finished watching this entire cycle and wanted to review Gotterdammerung first. A few comments about the cycle as a whole to begin: This is the most consistently sung, marvelously played, conducted, and beautifully produced cycle I have ever seen! I am a big fan of the Copenhagen Ring, a devout disciple of the Bayreuth/Chereau Cycle, and, yes, even an admirer of the ultra-traditional Met staging. This cycle, as a whole, blows all of the competition out of the water.

Across all four operas the filming is well done and the Blu-ray imaging is wonderful. The sound, as heard on my Boston Acoustics surround system, is very realistic and detailed with the orchestra in front of the singers. There is no spotlighting of the voices and one hears a realistic opera house sound. This is very important since Zubin Mehta draws powerful, passionate, and incredibly accurate playing from the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valencia. This is no small feat since, as a former orchestral musician, I can attest to the extreme difficulty of these scores. The orchestra plays this music as if it is in their blood. All the more amazing if one considers that this is a brand new ensemble made up of players who appear to be mostly very young. Of course, Mehta is an old hand in the pit. His interpretation is sweeping and dramatic.

Gotterdammerung clocks in at about 4 hours and 30 minutes. It always seems just right. The brass playing is spot-on with special mention going to the horn section and individual horn players who perform the various horn calls with a tremendously brassy tone. No mellow horns here! The wind section is amazing...especially the great clarinet duet at the beginning of Act One, Scene Three: beautifully phrased. The orchestra always plays in tune, even the first E-flat minor chord that opens the piece, often a tragedy even in good cycles, is right on pitch. There is never any scrappy ensemble in this performance.

The singers are all top notch. The Norns are appropriately mournful, the Rhine Maidens are sexy and sound great, and the fabulous Waltraute of Catherine Wyn-Rogers is menacing instead of resigned. What a voice. The Cor de la Generalitat Valencia is powerful and well-disciplined. The summoning of the Vassals (in Act Two) is quite an aural experience. I was a little disappointed that the horn calls (on trombones) for this scene weren't more primitive and overbearing.

The Gunther of Ralf Lukas is well sung. He plays Gunther as a real whimp, which is appropriate for this production. Ultimately, he is a helpless and sympathetic character. The Gibich clan inhabits a modern, technological, money obsessed, polluted world, that is a far cry from the rough and tumble, wilderness retreat of Siegfried and Brunnhilde. One moment of humor occurs when Gunther reacts to the smell of Siegfried (who probably hasn't bathed in years).  I enjoyed the trash in the Rhine River as Siegfried approached the Gibich Hall. By the way, there is a boat and it does go up river. Well done. Gutrune is a modern woman who seems obsessed with staying in shape and looking just right. Elisabete Matos sings and acts well.

Hagen is portrayed by the incomparable Matti Salminen. He looks and sounds terrifying. He is the Hagen of our day. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. He is impassive and yet he manipulates the action that leads up to Siegfried's death with the accuracy of a surgeon. His acting is never less than very good. His huge voice always comes over the orchestra with ease. When he calls the Vassals it is a hair-raising experience. The terrible, brooding night watch scene is Act Two brought a tingle to my spine. Alberich, who has aged horribly, floats in above Hagen's head. Truly frightening.

The Siegfried of Lance Ryan is amazing from a vocal standpoint. He never sounds tired and always looks heroic and handsome. Listen to that ""high C"" in Act Three, Scene Two...solid as a rock. No strain at all. He is a natural Heldentenor. He plays Siegfried as a simpleton; an immature teenager. I thought some of his acting was a bit much (he plays to the audience several times) but it was consistent with his interpretation. The scene with the Rhinemaidens is, for once, truly funny (and looks great). The scene leading up to his death is sung with perfect musicality and his death is truly touching. The funeral march, played to perfection, is especially moving as the Vassals carry Siegfried's body off of the stage and into the hall.

The highlight of this production is the AMAZING Brunnhilde of Jennifer Wilson. Her voice is powerful across a wide range and her high notes have razor sharp precision. There is never a wobble of any sort in her voice. Her voice just never flags. She is an excellent actress. Her Brunnhilde is not a perpetual victim. Her valedictory performance of the Immolation Scene is the crowning jewel in an impeccable interpretation. She will be the Brunnhilde of our age.

The production is a feast for the eyes and the ears. Realistic fire and water, shifting colors that project the inner world of the characters, and costumes that powerfully illustrate the clashing worlds of this story. I have never, never, never seen the final scene done as well...incredibly moving. Vahalla literally comes apart amid the flames. The multi-media projections are always used to grand effect. This production, though very modern, never does violence to Wagner's conception. A must see and hear for all Wagnerites. DON'T MISS THIS!",1268006400,31,5488,4.873526259378349
2261929,5,B000935TVI,"I am a Wagner fan of long standing; I have attended Bayreuth as well as various other international Ring performances. I also have seen most the generally regarded Ring versions on DVD. Excluding the less impressive Valencia Siegfried, my conclusion is that the Rheingold, Walkure and Gotterdammerung performances from this source(as seen on DVD)  must stand as my most exciting Wagnerian experience in years.

The performance under discussion sees a continuation of the virtues that I have described in my previous reviews of Rheingold and Walkure. Mehta's conducting is dynamic and his shaping of the musical line is unerring. The singing is generally excellent; Matti Salminen is an appropriately malevolent Hagen and Lance Ryan (a name new to me), while hardly a Melchior or a Windgassen, turns in  a solidly sung  Siegfried. It is a pleasure to newly encounter a firm voiced heldentenor; this is certainly a rare species in today's vocal firmament. The undoubted star of the show must be Jennifer Wilson's powerful and steely singing in the role of Brunnhilde.

The production in this last opera of the cycle becomes very modern. It is punkish at times and is peppered with humorous and sardonic touches. The filmed projections, somewhat busy but always appropriate, adds tremendously to the visual experience. The amazing final scene is a fitting ending to wondrous production. The busy realisation of the action might not appeal to those that like their Wagner in the style of old. It is worth noting that a  friend,who is a great Wagner buff, found the business on the stage during the live performance quite distracting. I think that the filmic production on the DVD version might be an improvement.

I generally have an antipathy towards ""modern"" productions but here I feel that everything works. Compared to the oft lauded Copenhagen Ring (which is less well sung, conducted, produced and filmed to my mind), the Valencia Ring is a far superior experience visually and musically.

The quality of the sound and filming are excellent. If you watch this on a good home theatre system the experience should be sensational. Bravissimo.",1267574400,15,2142,5.1
2261930,3,B000935TVI,"I could just say ""ditto"" to Charles Miller's review here...as I think he captured my feelings perfectly.  I'll add my two cents, though and cast my vote of three stars.

This was the first Wagnerian opera I've seen so my impressions are not those of a seasoned opera lover and you take them for what they are.  I was impressed by the setting--very austere, lots of smoke and haze, which gave the feeling of being in another time and place.  The costumes are monochromatic, grays and browns that fit the forest setting and the mythic sense of the piece. The music is extraordinary--no one can dispute that.  To people who have become used to twittering and too many lattes from Starbucks, this story unfolds very slowly.  I kept telling myself this was part of its charm and to sit still and enjoy the music.

I did.  The main problem I had personally in enjoying the presentation was the character of Siegfried, who was, after all the hero. I'm supposed to like him and root for him.  I guess I like my heros to possess some virtues other than brute strength and the courage born of stupidity.  This Siegfried is a bully, who spends the whole first half of the opera abusing Mime, the man who raised him from his birth, the closest thing he's had to a parent.

The blame for my distaste should lay on the shoulders of Wagner, I suppose but I think that better casting and perhaps some acting coaching would have helped.  Siegfried is, after all a young boy, probably a teenager who has been raised in the woods by a character who is a bit of an oddball, himself.  The casting of Manfred Jung wasn't helpful because of his age and fully developed, robust, stocky physique.  He comes off looking like a bully, throwing the diminutive Mime around like a ragdoll. If Siegfried's  youthful innocence/ignorance/enthusism had been emphasized more and his sheer bulky strength less, the character would have been more sympathetic. Jung's voice is fine but his acting ability is very limited.  He's great at playing fierce but when it comes to the tender scenes, he's a total washout.  His few attempts at smiling are wooden at best and almost embarassing.

Gwyneth Jones is also beyond the age of Brunhillde but she is beautiful and looks every inch the romantic heroine.  She sings well and her acting ability is  good enough. She conveys the feeling of a goddess-waking-up-to-be-a-human very well.

Heinz Zednick is a brilliant Mime and I agree with reviewer Miller that the story would have taken a better turn if Mime had offed Siegfried in the first act.  I found Donald McIntyre to be enchanting as the Wanderer/Wotan.  His gorgeous face is perfect for the imposing role and his physical movements were elegant and somehow very touching. The woman who sang the role of the forest bird was lovely as was the woman who played the part of Erda.

The third act in which Siegfried finally meets Brunhillde is the dramatic high point of the opera, but since Jung had not succeeding in winning me over, I just couldn't get into it.  I kept wincing and feeling sorry for Ms. Jones when it looked like Jung was going to kiss her.  If I were to buy a DVD of Siegfried I would shop around for a romantic hero I could believe in.",1240531200,,3215,4.5964912280701755

8056964,5,B000935TVI,"Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.

It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.

Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.

However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.

For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.

The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.

Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).

Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.

Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired double comic act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personally romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. Especially Kupfer/Barenboim were blessed with extraordinary singing.

Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Barenboim/Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was he who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz makes a biting Fricka firm of tone and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on the stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring recording, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness (on record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson do that). Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Jerusalem by the way gives a cameo here as Froh which is very effective. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her thinking that her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl do it I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, der got [Rest now o god] early in her immolation scene. That send shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer even has or probably ever will!

A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention. Chreaus directing is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim Bayreuth Ring betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and relays that amazing Bayreuth glow.

8056966,4,B000935TVI,"As Harry Kupfer's Liceo production draws to a close, the World Ash Tree recedes as a scenic element, crowded out by technological elements. Brnnhilde and Siegfried live in what looks like a missile silo, Hagen keeps watch amid satellite dishes and Rhinemaidens -- now pallid hags -- take refuge under sewer grates. In the concluding *coup de theatre*, the ring crumbles in a despairing Alberich's hand whilst two children clutch at a sapling -- the New World Ash?

Vocally, it's Deborah Polaski's show. She paces herself well and displays a combination of Heldensopran tonal production, dramatic involvement and sheer womanliness that make her the focus of the drama, even when events keep her offstage for long stretches. She is only surpassed by Anne Evans (Kupfer/Bayreuth), who succeeds at creating a lyrically oriented Brnnhilde, the voice riding effortlessly on the breath. Dramatically, the odds are even.

The Gibichungs are a negligible bunch in Kupfer I. Not so here. Elisabete Matos is a substantive Gutrune, right up there (well, almost) with Jeannine Altmeyer's va-va-voom vamp in Boulez/Philips. Matti Salminen repeats his ubiquitous Hagen and is a dominant presence, although I remember him not being so sloppy and smeary on Levine/DG. Unfortunately Falk Struckmann (we can't escape him!) lets the side down, his voice rattling like an empty wagon. Admittedly the standard for the role of Gunther is low but Franz Mazura (Boulez) and Iain Paterson (Luisi/DG) show it can be done quite well. Also, Kupfer over-eggs the pudding in terms of depicting the Gibichungs' decadence.

Both the Norns and the Rhinemaidens make ensemble well, and Julia Juon contributes an handsome-sounding Waltraute, keeping pace with stiff competition that includes Christa Ludwig (Levine) and two doses of Waltraud Meier (Barenboim/Kupfer I and Luisi), along with Gwendolyn Killebrew (Boulez). Whatever ailed Gunther von Kannen's Alberich in ""Siegfried"", he is a new man in ""Gotterdammerung,"" regaining his ""Rheingold"" excellence. The Hagen/Alberich dialogue is one of the high points of the show.

That leaves John Treleaven and either one has simply gotten used to his leathery sound or has to concede that he's hanging in there surprisingly well, although the high notes are pitches shoutd. The Siegfried-as-Gunther episode is actively good, in fact. Let's face it: It's a tough job and there aren't many people equipped to do it. Bertrand de Billy's conducting proceeds in fits and starts, although it's got more profile than Luisi's, which sounds like a reading rehearsal much of the time.

That being said, Luisi's is my default recommendation for ""Gotterdammerung."" Yes, Deborah Voigt's witchy tone requires some indulgence but Jay Hunter Morris is a perfect Siegfried and all the lower-voiced male roles are cast from strength, just to enumerate a few assets. There's no easy solution to assembling a ""Ring"" on video. I reckon I would cherry-pick Karajan/DG for ""Rheingold,"" Thielemann/Opus Arte for ""Walkre,"" Barenboim/Teldec for ""Siegfried"" and Luisi/DG for ""Gotterdammerung."" If forced to choose one set for the whole cycle, it would be Kupfer I, the Barenboim/Teldec cycle. This doesn't take into account the recent proliferation of ""Ring"" cycles on Blu-Ray but life is only so long and I've already given short shrift to some cycles, notably Chereau/Boulez/Philips, the most historically influential of the lot (but not one you'd buy for the singing) or Lehnhoff/Sawallisch/EMI, which is rarer than hen's teeth. Then there's the Schenk/Levine/DG set, which tries to wish away, Chereau, Wieland Wagner and basically any idea postdating 1951.

8056968,3,B000935TVI,"The weaknesses of this performance are, in the main, the weaknesses of the work itself.  Yes, there are a number of sublime moments in the score, but there are also some bad miscalculations on Wagner's part. Number one, the ""hero"" is almost impossible to like, unless you subscribe wholly to the opera's racist and anti-Semitic subtext (Aryan hero representing masterly, instinctive Youth and Will overcoming gruesome, mis-shapen, proto-Jewish dwarf, yuck.)  Then, Wagner wrote the Siegfried part, supposedly meant to represent an impetuous, naive teenager  in such a way that only a mature, adult tenor could sing it. So we get in the title role an overgrown lug with a pea brain, seemingly just returned from a Trump rally.  Zednick is excellent as the dwarf, but his part goes on for too long; he should have died sooner. Gwyneth Jones as Brunnhilde is perhaps an acquired taste. There is a lot of loud singing from S. and B. in the final scene, before they finally fall to the floor for a quick shag.

I very much admired Boulez' conducting, superbly paced and attentive to orchestral coloring.  The playing, too, is uniformly wonderful.  I remember, when the production was new,  the scandal around Chreau's staging of this cycle, but he seems to me, for the most part, right on and clearly focussed. For instance, the dwarf lives beneath an industrial sewer grating rather than in a cave, but why not?

8056972,5,B000935TVI,"This staging of Gotterdammerung by Fura Dels Bausto owes much of its success to the consistently high standard of singing and orchestral playing throughout. The musical values of the singers in this production can only be described as outstanding and, in my opinion, there is not a weak point to be noted anywhere in this regard. It therefore seems to me that it would be invidious to single out particular performers for particular praise in this review. Sufficient to comment that the remarkably consistent high quality achieved in the previous issues in this cycle are fully maintained in this latest issue.

The use of high quality projected backdrops to create scenarios or to imply long journeys, such as the descent from and return to the world of the Gods, are also very impressive and surely an advance in technology that would appeal to Wagner himself. This sense of realism would be hard to match in any `normal' stage production without using this modern technology.

The use of mechanical hoists to move the Gods about on raised platforms by on-stage scenery movers during the singing and as mentioned at the beginning of this review are, for me, the most invasive parts to my enjoyment of this production. However, I have found that upon repeated viewing, one adjusts and accepts the concept given the wealth of virtues otherwise present.

The camera work and imaging are both of a very high standard as one would expect from an HD recording and the same can be said of the sound which is frequently spectacular. The sound is presented in DTS 7.1 and stereo. There is also a 27 minute bonus feature that focuses on the making of this episode of the Ring.

A most enjoyable production overall therefore, but not, in my opinion, sufficient to entirely replace the Barenboim/Kupfer version on DVD complete with bleeding colours at all points of fast movement (and there are many)which still reigns supreme. Buy both if you can. The differences between the two are such that this is musically justifiable even if financially stretching!

Despite my preference for the earlier Barenboim version therefore, I still feel that this is well-worth the full 5 stars as such a preference may be more of a personal response. Both versions are equally worthy of 5 stars on any even-handed basis and we can be grateful that such a high quality choice has been put before us.",1343520000,,2373,4.849382716049383
