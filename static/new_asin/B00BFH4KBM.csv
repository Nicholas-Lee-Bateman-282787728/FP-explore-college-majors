8567779,5,B00BFH4KBM,"Set in 1971, the sisters of the Adoration monastery in a remote town in Rizal lead quiet and peaceful lives. Remy, an extern nun or someone who is able to leave the monastery from time to time to do errands for the nuns, learns from her mother that her activist brother was missing. She asks their Mother Superior Ruth for an indefinite leave of absence to help her family search for her brother. Since her request was turned down, she starts attending meetings of families with missing relatives secretly. Lourdes, who joined the monastery just recently, decides to become an extern too to go alongside with Remy and attend a meeting. They fell victim to violence on their way back.

Jodi Sta. Maria does a great job in her role.  I would recommend this movie to those who are curious about the life of Catholic Nuns and how it is affected by events outside their community.",1371859200,,875,4.602564102564102
