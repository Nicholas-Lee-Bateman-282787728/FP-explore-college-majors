8238063,2,B0010O90JM,"This DVD is, thankfully, very short. The singing is screechy and proper punctuation isn't used. My 2 year old learned sight words quickly and easily from a different DVD series so maybe he is too advanced for this but it didn't keep his attention. As a parent I can suffer through nerve-wracking sound effects on toys and terrible songs on DVDs if it means my little one is learning something or enjoying himself but the pain this causes isn't worth it. My kiddo has zero interest in it.",1454630400,,487,4.545454545454546
8238064,5,B0010O90JM,"This DVD is very well done.  It goes over the spelling and meaning of each word, as well as how to write it.  It's really well done!  The songs are catchy, while further instilling the word's application.  It'd be great if I could find more DVD's in this series.  I'm pretty particular about which ones I get (as there is plenty of so-so done stuff out there), and this one is great!",1409356800,,383,4.263888888888889
8238065,5,B0010O90JM,"My toddler knows the alphabet and I wanted to introduce some sight words.  Well this is a nice DVD that is enjoyable to listen and watch the entire 20 minutes.  The music is very catchy and enjoyable!  I only wish that there were more sight words taught on the DVD being that it only covers 13 words (I, we, go, see, like, can, the, my, you, to, in, on, and).  I did check the Youtube video out first before buying (which is short) and I can say that I don't regret buying this DVD.  It's educational and even teaches how to write the words.  All in all, it's great.  I wish that the DVD was longer than the 20 or so minutes but that's OK, it keeps my toddler's short attention span and gets to the point!  I would recommend this DVD to others, especially those with children who respond well to music.  I think that the music helps the concept stick.",1362009600,,851,4.203703703703703
8238066,5,B0010O90JM,"this is a great DVD. I saw it while subbing and the 1st graders loved it! It is simple and that always works best! Great, too, for young ones at home.",1320192000,,150,3.870967741935484
8238067,5,B0010O90JM,"I love this video! Just purchased it and my 2 1/2 year old has picked up on the words already after three viewings! My 1 1/2 year old is bopping to the music too! Upon the first viewing, my 2 1/2 year old kept asking to play it again! This video is age appropriate and is wonderful for beginning readers.",1309478400,2,304,4.083333333333333
8238068,5,B0010O90JM,"The I Can Read Songs for Reading DVD and Cd's are both suggested in the new book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Autism-Sisterhood-A-brief-Manual/dp/1452895465/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Autism Sisterhood: A (brief) Manual</a>.  I was thrilled when I received the opportunity to review this wonderful product.  I can definitely see why Michele Brooke suggested this product in her book.

The I Can Read Songs for Reading DVD teaches children to read 13 high-frequency sight words through songs.  During each song your child will see:

  * a child trace the word on paper
  * the word used in sentences
  * an adult and child correctly form each letter in the word
  * learn through formation chants (very similar to the Letter Formation Chants on the ABC Jesus Loves Me website) how to correctly form the letters
  * children form the word with their bodies by sitting and lying on the floor

My children were very drawn to the video (Little Man forgot to sit down through half of it because he was so enamored).  Bubs recognized several of the words from sight words that he is learning at school.  Sweet Pea was drawn because she wants to have sight words just like her big brother.

On their website - I Can Read Songs.org - you can download many free printables that coordinate with the DVD and Cd's.

  * Big Words - poster size prints of the sight words
  * First Books (similar to the ""My Color"" books on the ABC Jesus Loves Me website)
  * Second Books (a little more difficulty)
  * Sing Along Charts and Take-Home Sheets
  * Music Scores for each of the sight-word songs

These songs can be used in a school or home setting very easily.  This coordinates very well with what Bubs is learning in Kindergarten and will be something that Sweet Pea will enjoy watching and apply as we read together.  A great introduction to reading!  Plus, you have the opportunity to use these songs in DVD or CD form!

Thank you to I Can Read Songs for giving me the opportunity to review this product!",1291161600,4,2045,4.862973760932944
8238069,5,B0010O90JM,My son learned very quickly from this DVD. HE often sings the songs when he finds issues related to the words of this DVD. Just wish there were more volumes,1281398400,3,156,4.233333333333333
8238070,5,B0010O90JM,This dvd is the best I've seen for teaching my students their sight words.  Bravo!,1255305600,2,82,4.466666666666667
