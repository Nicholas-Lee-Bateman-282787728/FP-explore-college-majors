8223262,5,B000WGWZZU,"My Grandmother loved Patsy Cline and she was an avid Grand Ole Opry listener and viewer!  I was ecstatic when found these after my Grandma had been diagnosed with cancer.  My Aunt would put these DVD's on for my Grandma and my Grandma could enjoy her favorite Country music and Country music artists even when the Opry wasn't on.  She would gently rock in her chair, keep time with her hand, tap her toes, and fall asleep enjoying the videos.  My Aunt and I are not country music fans, but these videos are so nostalgic and such quality entertainment that they delighted us as well.  We highly recommend these.",1442275200,,610,4.559633027522936

8223268,5,B000WGWZZU,"Fifteen of the very biggest female country stars of the 1955-1974 era are gathered together here singing some of their greatest hits make this an absolute must for fans of classic country music.  The collection spans from the queen of country music Kitty Wells to 70's country starlet Barbara Fairchild and includes seven members of the Country Music Hall of Fame (Kitty Wells, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Jean Shepard, Connie Smith)  as well as at least three others whom we should be seeing in there within the next decade.  These are vintage performances from old syndicated country music shows.  Most of these ladies are singing their signature hit with a few notable exceptions (Wells, Cline, Lynn, Smith).  There are 8 number one hits here as well as five that peaked at #2 (it was much harder to hit #1 pre-1970 as songs would sit on top of the chart for months back then).  Here are the tracks and stars with the chart peaks for the songs also with year of the dvd performance included if different.) All footage is in color except for the first four performances:

JEAN SHEPARD - Second Fiddle to an Old Guitar (#5, 1964)
KITTY WELLS - Making Believe (#2, 1955, 1956)
PATSY CLINE - She's Got You (#1, 1961, 1962)
SKEETER DAVIS - The End of the World (#2 1963, 1965)
CONNIE SMITH - The Hurtin's All Over (#5 1966)
JEANNIE SEELY - Don't Touch Me (#2, 1966)
LORETTA LYNN - You Ain't Woman Enough (#2, 1966)
DOTTIE WEST - Country Sunshine (#2, 1973)
LYNN ANDERSON - Rose Garden (#1 1970, 1973)
JEANNE PRUETT - Satin Sheets (#1 1973)
TAMMY WYNETTE - Stand by Your Man (#1 1969, 1973)
BARBARA FAIRCHILD - Teddy Bear Song (#1 1973)
DONNA FARGO - The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA (#1, 1972)
SAMMI SMITH - Help Me Make it Through the Nigh (#1, 1971)
DOLLY PARTON - Jolene (#1, 1974)

These ladies are well chosen although the set curiously leaves out Jeannie C. Riley who hit #1 in 1968 with Harper Valley PTA and was a bigger star than Seely, Fairchild, or Pruett but they all deserve their slots, too.  I'd also like to have seen the underrated Jan Howard, Goldie Hill, Susan Raye, and Jody Miller in this set and since they each had top 5 hits they could have squeaked in had Time-Life decided to give us 20 queens instead of fifteen.  Still this is a wonderful collection and well worth the money.  You can buy this disc individually or in the complete boxed set by Time-Life.",1355184000,3,2410,4.517241379310345
8223269,5,B000WGWZZU,"Every Lady that performed left me breathless as I meet some of them for the first time through these video's but every song was a hit that I knew.  They didn't need to do some dance as there voice was all that it took to please me and the audience.  The other important thing is I will enjoy playing this DVD with my others over and over again as you had more quality in those days as people took pride in what they did.

8223270,5,B000WGWZZU,"Another great volume in the 8-DVD Time-Life collection of classic country music performances from Grand Ole Opry. This disc focuses on Nashville's greatest female performers -- Lynn Anderson, Patsy Cline, Skeeter Davis,  Loretta Lynn, Connie Smith, Dottie WestTammy Wynette and, of course, good old Dolly Parton (singing ""Jolene""! Yay!)  Some of the oldest material comes from Kitty Wells in the 1950s, while the later end of the set stretches into the early '70s with newcomers like Donna Fargo, Jeannie Pruett and Sammi Smith.  Cult favorites such as Barbara Fairchild and Jeannie Seely are also included -- if only Melba Montgomery had made the grade as well!  All in all, a great collection focusing on the ""better half"" of the Nashville scene.

This disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans. The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand."" The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, the way it used to be. This collection is a true gift -- highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1197244800,12,1401,5.021551724137931
