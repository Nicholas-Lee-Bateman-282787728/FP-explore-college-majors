7768081,1,B01GWC2VUG,I only could watch about 10 minutes.  That bad.,1425081600,,47,4.222222222222222
8763725,4,B01GWC2VUG,"Not bad, lots of interesting twists in the last part. Bet you don't guess correctly.",1502323200,,84,4.666666666666667
8763726,2,B01GWC2VUG,"Do not allow yourself to be cooled by the high ratings posted here. This movie isn't good. It starts off ok, and holds your attention pretty good. It is suspenseful, there are several suspects to choose from, but the kill scenes that eliminates the first few characters aren't good, and the last 15 minutes or so that reveals the killer, destroys this movie.",1488067200,,358,4.698412698412699
8763727,1,B01GWC2VUG,Too slow. Love Ms Cook better off on Criminal Minds. Did not like characters,1481760000,,76,4.5
8763728,4,B01GWC2VUG,"Surprisingly, this held my interest through the whole thing. A lot of these ""Horror"" movies on
Prime don't do that. It seemed to move along fairly well, and the acting wasn't bottom-of-
the-barrel awful. I would say it's even worth a rental, if it's cheap enough. The character of
the detective is a dead ringer for Jurgen Prochnow. Amazing.

For a Prime selection, not bad at all. I've seen many, many worse.",1460678400,,409,4.680555555555555
8763729,4,B01GWC2VUG,Good show.,1459209600,,10,4.5
8763730,1,B01GWC2VUG,"Horrorable and atrocious script with the usual suspects of post adolescent and adolescent college kids going on a hunting expedition; who become the hunted by a fiendish throwback to 1888 London serial killer!  Boring, stupid and full of needless profanity!  Not fit for human consumption and is indicative of the neocon gen that thrives on blood, gore and superfluous violence!",1450569600,,378,5.283333333333333
8763731,4,B01GWC2VUG,lots of  suspence  and you could not figure out the ending which was a surprise.,1439164800,,80,4.266666666666667
8763732,5,B01GWC2VUG,"I've thus movie at least 3 times now.  It's not completely the best movie out there,but A.J. Cook does a really good job as do the rest of the cast.",1437177600,,148,3.933333333333333
8763733,1,B01GWC2VUG,"I watched about 10 minutes, fell asleep, woke up and went out to watch paint dry.",1432944000,,81,4.125
