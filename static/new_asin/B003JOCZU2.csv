4131120,5,B003JOCZU2,"I rented this movie on Netflix, and found it so engaging that I wanted to own it.  The story about a beautiful Mustang who becomes a ""Friend"" (My Friend Flicka) is told beautifully in this lovely movie.  I liked the ending.  Won't give it away to those who have not yet seen it.  Watch it, and watch it with your kids.",1306886400,4,318,4.163934426229508

4131122,3,B003JOCZU2,"Sorry, my original review was for ""Flicka"" (the remake with Tim McGraw). Flicka2 is a sequel to that movie, but is much less satisfying. Some of the story line is contrived to fit the sequel requirements, which is annoying. Nevertheless, if you like the premise and you like movies about horses, this movie will entertain you.",1292889600,,326,4.839285714285714
4131123,4,B003JOCZU2,"For having to come after the 1st Flicka with all different actors, this group did very well.  My wife would give it even more.",1288396800,,126,4.25
4131124,5,B003JOCZU2,"I love horses & will watch any horse movie, Flicka was a favorite as a kid & still is, so I had to have Flicka 2.
Love this movie.",1277164800,,130,3.5172413793103448
4131125,5,B003JOCZU2,I love this movie. I'm a big  Clint  Black fan and have all his movies.,1276387200,,71,3.6666666666666665
4131126,5,B003JOCZU2,the movie was shiped very quick and everything came very well packaged. The sight was very easy to use. Thanks!,1276214400,,111,4.6
4131127,3,B003JOCZU2,"Our family LOVED the first Flicka movie. We have watched it over and over with the kids. My 10 year old daughter was SO excited when they announced Flicka 2 was coming out. She is a big horse fan and takes riding lessons, etc. The first one was a wonderful, touching story and we waited eagerly to see what had happened when Katy took over the wild mustang ranch with her dad (Tim McGraw) and her brother went off to college.

Don't get your hopes up. Flicka 2 has NOTHING to do with the original Flicka. None of the carachters are the same. This movie is totally different. Flicka, the horse, IS in it, but that is the ONLY carachter that is the same.

This one is about a ""skater"" girl,Keri, (Katy's cousin) that has to go live with her father after her grandma (who cares for her) gets ill. She is a city girl and she has to go live on a ranch with her dad. It's all about the city girl going country and the struggles that ensue with her adjusting to her new life with her dad. Apparently her dad was either Katy's dad's brother or Katy's mom's brother because through the movie Katy is referred to as this girl's (Keri's)cousin. They are keeping Flicka while Katy goes off to college to become a veterinarian. Confused yet ? I was.

Ok.....

1---Where is Katy's family ? Why can they not keep Flicka ? They do OWN a horse ranch! Why is Flicka with these people?
2---In the first movie,Katy said she did NOT WANT to go to college, she wanted to take over the ranch. Now she's in vet school ?
3---Katy's brother wanted to go to college. He is not mentioned in this movie.
4---Katy's uncle is never mentioned in the first movie, nor is Kate's city girl cousin Keri.

The acting in this movie is horrible. Ok for kids, but adults will notice. I cannot stress enough, the FIRST one was great with great actors. You can tell this one was an attempt to make a decent movie, but it falls short. If you have NOT seen the first one you WILL enjoy this one. If you HAVE seen the first one, don't expect this one to pick up where the first one left off or you will be disappointed.

ALL that being said, it IS a safe/clean movie for families and children. :) Horse lovers will like seeing the beautiful horses.

My daughter likes Flicka 2 but was let down, she just wanted to see the rest of the first story, not a totally new plot.

The whole first movie was about how Katy did NOT want to go to college and how she fought to keep Flicka/take over the ranch with her dad, and how her brother was dying to leave the ranch and go to school. Now Katy is in vet school (?), Flicka is somewhere else, and nobody else is mentioned. LOL.",1275436800,19,2624,4.2235528942115765
4131128,4,B003JOCZU2,"We rented Flicka 2 and watched it.  I suppose people with a lot of horse knowledge could pick it a part but we enjoyed it.  It was a good story about a teenage girl restoring her relationship with her Dad. I enjoyed seeing Patrick Warburton play a sympathetic character instead of his typical ""dufas"" kind of role.  The leading lady was likable and the story spent a little time, at the beginning, creating awareness of the Wild Mustang roundups that are going on in our nation. Our family enjoyed it.",1274140800,4,501,4.544444444444444

4131203,5,B003JOCZU2,"sequels  are rarely as good as the original. Flicka 2 falls into that category too. However instead of trying to continue on the story from where Flicka left off, Flicka 2 is a new story, although basically the same idea. There are all new characters, all new issues all new solutions.

a horrid neighbor ends up getting Flicka. Carrie has to get her back, during this story, Carrie learns to go from city girl to sorta country girl. She learns to ride, learns to love the horses. Flicka in particular. She over comes problems her way and adapts to life on the ranch.

She and her Dad learn to be a family., save Flicka and have a happy ending for all.

Flicka 2 did not make me cry like Flicka did. But I still think this movie is one worth buying. If you like family friendly horse movies that is.",1404000000,,799,4.306666666666667

We know there is a third, and my granddaughter has begged me to get that one too, but as I understand it, it is the same story as Flicka 2, just the Dad's version... I do not think my granddaughter would like it as well, although I probably would!",1360886400,,447,4.1976744186046515

8398352,1,B003JOCZU2,"What is it about movies today where kids are brats portrayed as a hero in the end???  Yes, the child had a hard life, but to show her doing illegal acts and dangerous things as okay, its not good!!!!  The girl steals a horse she lost because she wanted her way, and in the end she is the hero of the story!  We threw this one away also.",1517788800,,336,3.911764705882353

8398357,1,B003JOCZU2,"This movie was laughably terrible. City girl who has never seen a horse ends up chasing down a herd after a few lessons. Faraway shots of the stunt double riding and close up shots of the actress riding were night and day: She rode like she was sitting on a couch and that poor saddle took a beating carrying such a floppy seat. I about died when she told her dad, ""I already know how to ride"" after two lessons. She then goes and rides this thing bareback in the dark, rainy night into the mountains alone. Movies like these are grossly fake to people who have spent years learning how to ride. No wonder most non-horsey people think riding is so easy. If you know anything about horses, your eyes will roll out of their sockets. And the main character is impossible, annoying and rude. Why would anyone want their children to mirror that?",1511481600,,840,4.425806451612903
