7901293,5,9089701648,"Beautiful and interesting locations.
You pass someone occasionally and you get to see some simple dwellings, making you admire the natural lifestyle.
More shrubs and plants than palm trees but very lovely just the same.
It is so worthwhile to see places I will probably never have the opportunity to visit in this life.
Education through travel.
An excellent use for DVD technology indeed.
No regrets.

7901294,5,9089701648,"The DVD is very well suited for a treadmill with incline adjustment since the walking goes uphill very often. You walk or run past many palm trees, here and there you meet a few people and animals and sometimes you pass houses. It is very sunny, the sky is bright blue, you almost feel the warmth of the tropics. The images are often accomponied by birdsong so you have the feeling of really exercising in nature. There are four videos on the DVD, two of which are very slow. I use these two for walking, the other two videos I use for running. I like the DVD very much, it shows a wonderful landscape with bright colors. Exercising is a lot more fun and you even feel holiday mood.",1443744000,,682,4.294573643410852

7901298,1,9089701648,"It is filmed at too slow of a pace. I don't think I could actually walk that slow if I tried. I can put it on fastforward, but then I lose the sounds and the music. I would not recommend this to anyone.",1360022400,,202,3.7209302325581395
7901299,5,9089701648,"Love this virtual DVD.
Took me awhile to find Fitness Journeys - Tropical Palm Trees by Tony Helsloot and Liz Jones.  There's several virtual DVD's available from other sellers that are unprofessional.  Seems like anyone with a movie camera thinks they can create virtual experiences!  I loved these especially because there is no music, so I can listen to my own.
If you love working out in nature but can't make it this is a great dvd.
I use in my home gym.
Thank you Liz and Tony.
Well done.",1291852800,5,494,4.466666666666667
7901300,4,9089701648,First time I've watched a video like this. At first it was alittle bouring but it got better. On rainy days I enjoy walking on the treadmill and found this passed the time quickly. The video is a little machanical as it just moves on a straight direction. I would have liked it to pan to the side from time to time like most people would do while they walk but I found myself trying to find object of to the side and made my walk kinda fun. I could see owning a few of these as I like scenery when I walk,1289520000,5,504,3.9029126213592233
7901301,4,9089701648,"Recent studies have shown that we should give our brains a break from our electronic devices once in a while. Exercising is a great opportunity for that and I found that turning ""Fitness Journeys"" on while I am on the treadmill helps me clear my mind and get more from my exercise than when I watch a show or listen to loud music on my iPod.

I recommend it!",1285632000,5,358,4.188405797101449
