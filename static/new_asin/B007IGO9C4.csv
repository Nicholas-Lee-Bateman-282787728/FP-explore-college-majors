They will play on computer.  Suspect bad quality control on part of supplier.  Region 2 discs probably even though computer does not ID them as such.  Useable but not what I wanted.",1519084800,,334,4.222222222222222

8517486,2,B007IGO9C4,"The Series itself is 5 stars....however, do NOT buy this 3 disc version. For some reason, someone released this set and it is incomplete. The full series is 13 episodes in a single season. There are versions of this out there in 4 disks so double check to make sure you have the FULL documentary before you buy. This version of the set (3 discs) stops at episode 9 around the time that France is liberated. Four additional episodes that wrap up the documentary series was, for some reason, left off this set.

That being said, I highly recommend the full series as for once it details the war without making America the focus. It's nice to see what went on from the perspective of all the other countries. In fact, America is barely touched on and this is refreshing as there is so much more history to this war than just the United State's involvement. I am an American and was pleased and proud to own this set. Just be sure you are buying the full 13 episode series!!!",1453507200,10,971,4.394444444444445
