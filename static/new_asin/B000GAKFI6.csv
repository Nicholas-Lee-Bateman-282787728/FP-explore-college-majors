2603382,4,B000GAKFI6,"The Moonstone is classic vintage BBC from a time when there seemed to be much more interest in portraying 19th century literature for eager viewers. As a great fan of Robin Ellis (Poldark) I have been wanting to see this production for quite some time. The production values, acting and story were all quite wonderful with one exception: the costuming of Mr. Ellis was quite horrible. Although probably historically accurate, the plaid suit, bow ties and round crowned hats were less that flattering, and gave him the look of a 10 year old school boy. As the major love interest and hero of the story, a more mature look was essential to his characterization. Call me superficial, but as his sweetheart I would have had to laugh at his clothing choices and wonder aloud at his level of romantic sophistication. Other than that, it was a great show to look forward to. If only there were more on the way....",1286928000,,906,4.66875
2603383,4,B000GAKFI6,"As a period piece, this BBC adaptation of Wilkie Collin's ""The Moonstone"" kept my attention quite well and was a pleasure to watch. For individuals who are unaware of the solution to the 'mystery,' I believe the adaptation will be even more enjoyable, although some people may have a difficult time accepting the solution to the mystery in turns of its improbable nature.

The acting in this adaptation, as well as the picture quality, are quite adequate to watch. Of course, as is true for any miniseries from the 1970s, the picture quality (4:3 aspect ratio) and style (ex: long shots rather than short 5 second clips edited together) might leave some people born in the age of high-definition, fast-paced television a bit disappointed.

However, I would certainly recommend this BBC adaptation, especially since I detested the late 1990s Masterpiece Theatre adaptation, which modernized the dialogue and behavior of the characters and could hardly be said to follow Wilkie Collin's intent.

As a final point, this BBC film adaptation released by Acorn Media does NOT contain subtitles, which was a disappointment.",1275696000,11,1116,5.154696132596685
2603384,4,B000GAKFI6,"At long last! I first viewed the multi-episode ""Moonstone"" on PBS after being captivated by ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and the ""Mystery"" series. I recognized various actors who seemed to move in and out of other series ""The Pallisers,"" etc.  John Welsh -- Sgt. Cuff here, was the dotty old retainer in ""Duchess of Duke Street,"" and Peter Sallis, Mr. Bluff in the Moonstone, shone as Mr. Bonteen in the aforementioned Pallisers, and continues to shine in ""Last of the Summer Wine.""  The production values of the Moonstone is high; the costumes are downright rich and elegant. Clothes do tell a story -- at a glance you discerned different stations in life, occupations, values.  However, the sound wavered from soft to softer, and I had to remember to turn the volume down on my TV after using the DVD player before switching back to regular TV.  Hint: buy this series for yourself and after viewing, if you don't want to keep it, donate the DVD to your public library so others can enjoy it.",1168560000,16,987,4.72093023255814
2603385,5,B000GAKFI6,I have been waiting  for the BBC to reissue this excellent Masterpiece Theatre production -- much superior to the shorter version released several years ago.  It was worth the wait!,1167782400,10,181,5.0
2603386,5,B000GAKFI6,"What a pleasure to see the original production of Collins' The Moonstone at last! The recent version was good, but this one seemed far more satisfying. I've always been a sucker for John Welsh, who was splendid as the detective. I've always been a Robin Ellis fan, so his presence was a bonus. The production held up well for its 30-odd years. I would recommend this production to those who love great British drama.",1163030400,31,416,4.635135135135135

8129902,4,B000GAKFI6,"I remember this from Masterpiece Theatre, so many years ago. I bought it because I'm such a big fan of Robin Ellis and apparently I didn't remember that he was in this!
A little problem with the episodes being numbered on the 1st disc, but every episode IS on the discs.

Really interesting story and great charactors",1459296000,,317,4.56140350877193
8129903,4,B000GAKFI6,"It was sort of a hoot to see Robin Ellis play a role other than his signature performance as Ross Poldark in another 1970s series. The acting felt a bit constrained to me and might have benefited from a bit more passion or emotion.  But overall I enjoyed this production of one of the first mystery novels to be written. I haven''t read the book, so I didn't anticipate any of the small plot twists along the way.  The final episode seemed to progress faster than the previous episodes had, so if it feels slow moving to you, try to stick with it The dialogue is pretty good and the characters are not two-dimensional, which is an accomplishment when there are so many characters.  I don't expect to watch it again, so I would suggest borrowing or renting it rather than buying it. But watch it if you like British costume dramas.",1443657600,,830,4.447368421052632

8129905,5,B000GAKFI6,"A good telling of the first true detective novel.  The only flaw lies in the original Collins' book:  not enough Sgt. Cuff.  He brings everything alive and when he disappears for a long, long stretch the story loses strength. But he comes back in the end.",1408060800,,255,4.5
8129906,4,B000GAKFI6,"Before there was Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, there was a tale of drugs, suicide, a stolen Indian diamond and a reported curse.

Specifically, there was ""The Moonstone,"" Wilkie Collins' long and twisting Victorian tale that is considered the first mystery novel in the English language. And the 1972 miniseries adaptation is a pretty faithful one, interlacing a love quadrangle with a mystery about a stolen diamond said to be cursed -- while it slows down somewhat in the middle, it's a pretty suspenseful little story.

After ten years in continental Europe, Franklin Blake (Robin Ellis) returns to England to bring his cousin Rachel Verinder (Vivien Heilbron) her eighteenth birthday present: a massive diamond called the Moonstone. It was left to her by her vile uncle, possibly as a malicious act -- three Hindu priests are lurking nearby, hoping to reclaim the sacred gem stolen from them long ago. Everyone except Rachel really wants the diamond split up, so it will no longer be a danger.

At the same time, Rachel is being wooed by two men -- the somewhat irresponsible young Franklin, and the prosperous but less attractive Godfrey Ablewhite (Martin Jarvis). And a timid, lame young maid named Rosanna (Anna Cropper) has fallen desperately in love with Franklin (though he's completely oblivious to this).

Then after a dinner party, the Moonstone vanishes, leaving a smudge on a newly-painted door as the only clue. It seems that only someone in the house could have stolen it. But it doesn't turn up in any police sweeps, the priests have alibis, and Rachel flatly refuses to let Sergeant Cuff (John Welsh) investigate further. She also refuses to speak to Franklin again. And after several months, Franklin learns of some new clues that could reveal who stole the Moonstone. With the now-retired Cuff and a disgraced doctor's assistant helping him, he sets out to unravel the mystery once and for all.

""The Moonstone"" contains a lot of the tropes that later detective novels would use -- reenactment of the crime, red herrings, the culprit being the least likely suspect (in fact, barely a suspect at all), and an English country house where you wouldn't expect a theft to take place. It even has TWO detectives -- a quirky police sergeant with plenty of brains, and a gentleman who is bright but kind of inexperienced.

It's presented in the same way as every 1970s British historical miniseries: rather stagy sets, paired with dramatic acting and very accurate hairstyles and costumes. While some of Collins' quirkiness is lost in translation, the writers maintain some of the humorous subplots -- such as Miss Clack's hyperpious ramblings that nobody listens to, or Godfrey's ""Awkward. Very awkward."" Strangely enough, they also keep in the subtle hint of a same-sex relationship AS WELL AS the drugs.

The third episode kind of gets bogged down -- due to a year, two deaths and a brief engagement happening between the theft and the crime-solving -- before lurching back into the main plot. Most of that middle section is devoted to all the personal turmoil in Rachel's life because of the Moonstone's theft, as well as a subplot involving a money-lender.

It should be noted that this DVD release is... not very good. The volume is set low, the picture sometimes becomes a bit wobbly and has not been remastered at all, and there are no subtitles. Honestly, they should remaster this and release it with other historical adaptations.

However, the actors all do a pretty good job -- Ellis gives a very passionate, strong performance, and Heilbron is likable and charismatic despite playing a rather hostile character at times. Lady, if a guy stops smoking and spends days painting a DOOR for you, he's not just toying with your affections. And Cropper captures the poignant longing of a woman who has no actual hopes of being loved, and just wants the man she adores to notice her.

""The Moonstone"" is a pretty decent adaptation of the classic mystery, with some solid acting and a third episode that drags a bit. But what it really needs is a new remastered edition.",1403136000,,4092,4.917391304347826

8129908,3,B000GAKFI6,"Not the best version, but not too bad.  The characters were a bit over done for my taste.  I donated this to the public library.",1382313600,,128,4.08
8129909,5,B000GAKFI6,"Intriguing play like dvd of this famous story. Usual BBC adaptation that is well done. Good acting, interesting story from Wilkie Collins' mystery stories..",1358726400,,156,5.541666666666667
8129910,5,B000GAKFI6,"An enjoyable story, full of suspense, mystery, and all the trappings of period (mid 19th century) drama done well. It is BBC 1972, and has the film impression of theater style miniseries done at that time. Not normal by 21st century standards, but for those who enjoy an occasional theater performance, this Masterpiece Theatre DVD set is almost as good as live. So expect little background music, as typical in modern TV, and don't expect the sudden nano-second change of view, so typical of today's filming. Younger generations want speed, not time for thought.

This filming allows for the best to come from the actors expressions and movements, and several very accomplished actors appear in this version of the Moonstone, considered by many to be the best, even better than more recent attempts. This set stars Basis Dignam (The Pallisers- excellent series); Robin Ellis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poldark-Series-2/dp/B0038M2SBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poldark: Series 2</a>- a must own set); Martin Jarvis (Lorna Doone, Pallisers); John Welsh (The Duchess of Duke Street- such a delightful & long lasting series); and Peter Sallis (Last of Summer Wine, and also a major voice in Wallace & Gromit- gotta love that.) Oh there is more...

The story is unique and comes from Wilkie Collins, a long friend and colleague of Charles Dickens. Thus you get the Dickens flavor in this story, one of Collins' best known works, the other being ""The Woman in White."" This is partially why my belief that the theater style of filming of The Moonstone is truer to the story, since only theater, not TV, existed at the time of the writing. I'd bet the author would be pleased. A realistic adaptation. 5 episodes, 221 min, no CC.

At the date of this review, you can buy it at half the original retail cost, like I did. That is a huge plus. My wife and I agree, a keeper, one to watch again. Or share with family and friends.",1338422400,4,1961,5.046296296296297
