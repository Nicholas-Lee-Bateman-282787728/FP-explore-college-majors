8491798,1,B00634ML7W,"I <3 Chris Sarandon so much! This movie though, was aweful...it does not hold ones interest in the least and the romance between Sarandon and Tenant does not work at all! Also, not a good horror flick in any sense...it was torture sitting through this one....If you <3 horror and Chris as well, go with Fright Night (1985)...this man smokes the screen in this movie and takes the lead Way over the top....",1361577600,,405,4.561643835616438
