8245165,5,B0012DQC0G,"Going back to 1964 is heartbreaking for any Phillies fan as they lost 10 games in row to blow the pennant.  However this film brings back so many wonderful memories that any fan from that time should view this.  For me it reminds me of my childhood, my neighborhood, and my visits to Connie Mack Stadium.  Richie Allen was my favorite player of that time and actually of all time.  Only a non-Phila fan would rate this less than 5 stars.",1204156800,3,437,4.3580246913580245
