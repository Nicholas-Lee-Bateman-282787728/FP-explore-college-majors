1350902,4,B00004TJH4,"If you enjoyed watching UFC hits volume 1, i expect you will get a good time by watching this DVD. The fights on this DVD are somewhat different than the ones that can be seen on UFC hits 1. The other reviewers of this DVD also mentioned this. What i especially like about this DVD, is that most of the fights shown lasted longer than the fight on UFC hits 1. You can watch the complete match of Frank Shamrock vs. Tito Ortiz. That means more than 15 minutes of action. What an athlete Shamrock is. I am a great fan of the fighting style of Marco Ruas and for that reason find it great to see Pedro Rizzo representing the Ruas Vale Tudo style. Especially the match against the vicious 'Tank' Abbott in Ultimate Brazil.
There are som extra features on this dvd that are worth mentioning. The multi-angle kamera fight of Orlando Weit is one that you should not forget to watch.
Also the interview with Bas Rutten is quit interesting. He tells the viewer that in highschool he was't a popular guy at all and he had astma. A while ago he had a reunion and met his old classmates and they all turned out to be losers in a bad physical shape. He got the microphone and asks if there are persons who still wanted to fight with him. Great guy, Bas Rutten. Also a great fight can be seen on this dvd with this former King of Pancrase.
Interesting fights with KO's as well as submissions. A great DVD.",1017446400,6,1391,4.2727272727272725
1350903,4,B00004TJH4,"This tape does a good job of editing out some of the ""slower"" sections of the bouts...we have all seen extended periods of ""ground and pound"". I don't mind the absence of Pride's bizarre music and fireworks, and the narration is educated. Ranks in the top quarter of MMA choices.",1005782400,3,279,4.6
1350904,5,B00004TJH4,"Who is this guy?  It doesn't matter, just buy the DVD to see the KO",1004486400,,67,3.466666666666667
1350905,4,B00004TJH4,"If you watch Hits 1 & 2 back to back, it's like watching the evolution of MMA tournaments.  The first DVD contains quick bloody brawls with lopsided matchups.  As the DVD progresses, the opponents become more diverse and the fights become a lot more that simple brawls or 1 minute knockouts.
The fights in Hits 2 are far more technical and the opponents are more evenly matched.  Some spectators might complain that these fights are boring compared to the ones in Hits 1, others may complain that the rules have changed for the worse, making ""No Hold Barred"" a thing of the past.
I think Hits 2 is equally enjoyable, just... different.  There isn't the mad adrenaline we saw in the first... but there's a lot of strategy.  The new breed of MMA fighters draw their talents and skills from a lot of tools, and althought the matches are quick, they take their time and utilize their enrgy more efficiently.
So, if you want the nasty fights, be sure to buy Hits 1.  If you want to see strategy, get this one.  If you're a big fan, you'll get both.",997747200,5,1043,4.457894736842105
1350906,4,B00004TJH4,The first UFC Hits tape was the first MMA tape I ever watched.. seeing Taylor Tuli get his head kicked clean off it's shoulders and into row 9 (ok maybe I'm blowing the story up a little) freaked me out so much I had to pause the tape and ask myself if this was the sort of [stuff] I wanted to watch........14 NHB tapes and GRACIE sweatshirt later I suppose that YES it's the sort of thing I like to watch. This DVD is a little more technical than UFC Hits 1... but that actually makes it a better show to watch ...except for the Tank and Vitor parts. The feature match between Frank Shamrock and a young Ortiz is one of the best matches you'll ever see.....I'd like to see a rematch in UFC soon.,989625600,2,696,4.125
1350907,5,B00004TJH4,"As a dabbler in mixed martial arts myself, I love getting the oppportunity to see different fighters try their skills in a one on one, (almost)anything goes environment.  I've seen most of the early UFC's, but due the current cable ban, I'm unfamiliar with most of the more recent ones.  This DVD is a great collection of some of the best fights of the more recent UFC's.  Although not all of the fights are shown in their entirety, there are some classic moments.  The Tito Ortiz vs. Guy Mezger rematch is great, if not for the utter domination Ortiz shows at the end, then for the confrontation between Ortiz and Mezger's trainer, Ken Shamrock after the bout.  The Tito Ortiz vs. Frank Shamrock fight alone is worth 5 stars for the unbelievable action and skill displayed by these two.  A definate must for anyone into martial arts, fighting, boxing, WHATEVER.  Get this!",987811200,3,873,4.703947368421052
1350908,4,B00004TJH4,"Love UFC and other MMA competitions.  This is a great DVD for those people who do not want to buy each and every UFC out there.  It covers the best fights between UFC 17 up to UFC Japan.  The first 8 fights are cut and edited, so don't expect a lot of action (average showtime for each fight: 2 minutes).  They go by pretty quickly.  However, they are taken from some of the best fights ever, and reveal just how diverse a fighter needs to be in order to win UFC (unlike the first UFCs, where it would be kickboxer vs. grappler- now it is strictly MMA vs. MMA). The last 5 fights are unedited (nice length), and fantastic!  Tito Ortiz vs. Frank Shamrock is one of, if not, the best.  Eugene Jackson shows some great patience against a newcomer in UFC Japan, and in the very last fight, Rizzo vs. TK, both fighters try to prove once again why he is one of the best fighters of all time. Much more defense in this video than a lot of the earlier UFCs.  This video does not have the violence and gore held in the previous videos.  It is more likely to please those audience memebers who are intensely interested in MMA (like myself).  However, the average guy on a few beers will most likely drool over this DVD as well. The interview with Bas Rutton is really cool, though the two ""special"" fights (where you can switch camera angles) are pretty lame.  They come from the earliest of UFCs, and are over pretty quickly (although they are pretty intense, even for being strictly ""one-discipline"" fights). Overall, a great buy.  The 13 (plus 2) fights are great, especially the last 5 unedited fights.  Great selection of fighters, from the names (Tank, Tito, Rizzo) to the unknowns.  Buy this DVD if you are a fan of MMA and UFC.",976147200,15,1725,4.383647798742138
1350909,5,B00004TJH4,this video is great! it lacks some of the gore of the early ufc's but has plenty of ko's. this video is the first to have a complete and unedited version of the greatest ufc fight of all times: frank juarez shamrock v tito ortiz. also includes vitor's unbelievable fluke against vanderlei silva,975024000,,294,4.566037735849057
1350910,4,B00004TJH4,"This is a good follow-up collection to UFC Hits 1, but as probably expected the first video contained the better fights.  Still UFC Hits 2 managed to collect a number of classic bouts of fighters such as Tank  Abbot, Pedro Rizzo, Tito Ortiz, Jerry Bohlander, Hugo Duarte, and Mark  Coleman.  Also features an interview with Bas Rutten.
Given the large  storage capacity of the DVD format, I hope that they eventually come out  with perhaps a cheap, boxed set of the series.  Watching a collection of  ""highlight"" fights is okay, but for real UFC fans and martial  arts afficionados like myself watchingthe entire/unedited fights at times  is more thrilling.  Not to mention educational.  Also, many of the fights  in the earlier UFCs, featuring stand-up fighters vs. grapplers, which have  high ""eye-opening"" value for martial art practitioners, were  notably absent in both videos.
Again, this is a great disc especially for  those who already purchased the first.",964828800,4,965,5.089743589743589
7922839,1,B00004TJH4,if your interested in this movie.i wouldnt buy it if u own ufc ultimate knockouts 1 and 2 its basicly all it is besides a couple fights.i hope the first one is better cuz i just got it and have not watched it.,1207699200,,209,3.883720930232558
7922840,1,B00004TJH4,Just terrible and not worth the money.  The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill.  Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.,1152489600,,179,4.741935483870968
7922841,5,B00004TJH4,"These are some great fights from the mid-stages of the UFC.  The DVD takes you from UFC 17 through UFC 23, selecting some of the best fights to be revisited in this volume.  Although the bulk of the footage is just from really good fights, there are a few legendary knockouts here.

We get to see Tito at the beginning stages of his rise.  We see him here in UFC 18 & 19 - and we also get to see him getting his first taste of talent at the level of Frank Shamrock early in his career.

Pedro Rizzo makes a few appearances on this collection.  His strikes are always blazing and precise.  Eugene Jackson also has a few good fights included.

This is a good collection.  There are certainly boring moments, but the action always picks up quickly.  The knockouts of Mark Coleman and Steve Judson alone are worth the price of the DVD.  These fights were previously only available on VHS - so they make a fine addition to your UFC and mixed martial arts collection.",1142553600,2,961,4.342696629213483

7922843,4,B00004TJH4,"If you love the sport of MMA or the UFC promotion in itself...this is a great DVD.  Some people won't like it compared to UFC Hits vol. 1 cause the UFC became a sport and left the toughman tournaments behind.  But I think this DVD is a great showcase of fighting techniques.  Just as volume 1 left off showing the evolution UFC was making.  Another great thing for some people is this DVD has several Tito Ortiz fights, Tito was one of the big reasons why UFC survived through the rough period of MMA in the Unite States.  Last 5 fights are complete.  2 bonus fights from UFC 2 have multi-angles.  My only problem with this DVD is that a few matches are dull to the point of wondering why they put them on here for any reason.  a few fights lack any technique or movement.  But its only a few.  And its still a 4 star DVD.  Great companion to Volume 1.",1085875200,3,852,4.1656441717791415
7922844,4,B00004TJH4,The UFCs started the grappling trend in the U.S.  If you want to learn how the professionals do their techniques go to USBJJ.COM and for $7.99 you can get the US Military Brazilian Jujitsu Manual and 105 short videos.,1069286400,3,217,4.564102564102564
7922845,1,B00004TJH4,"There are far fewer matches than volume one, and some fights seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought.  My opinion is that this was rushed to production.  Hands down I would recommend volume 1 over volume 2.
Special features on the DVD are minimal, but do include an interview with Bas Rutten.",1039219200,3,294,4.528301886792453
7922846,5,B00004TJH4,"Imagine all of the best moments and best fights in UFC history, and now imagine them all on one tape.  (Or on one DVD in some cases.)  I love the UFC.  It's very good stuff.  Painful to watch at times, but still very awesome.
The cool thing about this is that all of the long moments of fights were nothing is really going on are taken out.  You're taken to the beginning of a fight, or to one that's already in progress, making sure that you only see the best.
Great fighters in this one.  You get to see Tank Abbott, Tito Ortiz, Steve Judson, Mark Coleman, and many, many more.  It's pretty long too, about 118 minutes.  Pretty sweet deal if you ask me.  I'll have to check out Vol. 1 when I get the chance.
Very nasty and brutal knock-outs included.  Brutal submissions.  Intense competition.  And yes, the very popular confrontation between Tito and Ken Shamrock after one of the matches.  Wow....Tito not a very good sport, I guess.  He just gave Shamrock the ""Steve Austin"" gesture!
If you love the UFC, buy this now!  I recommend that you see the actual full length events that are available on tape to fully appreciate this, but this is a great companion, and great for when you only want to see the best of the best.  A very worthy purchase, or at least I thought it was.",1026518400,7,1280,4.337552742616034
7922847,5,B00004TJH4,"This dvd holds some great fights. None as great as the Frank Shamrock VS Tito Ortiz though...  I watched this just to see the championship bout between these two great fighters. Why is this fight so great?  Almost the entire fight Frank is on his back getting bombed by Tito Ortiz's punches and various attacks. Why does Frank Shamrock come out the winner of the fight? Because he is in better contition then Tito, and he knows it. Tito wants to be on the top, ""dominating the entire fight"" which is what Frank wants. He wants Tito to wear himself out so he can deliver a spectacular move at the end, which you will see when you buy this dvd.  YOU WILL BE STUNED.",1023753600,,663,4.330645161290323
