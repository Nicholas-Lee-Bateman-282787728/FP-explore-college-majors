8077782,5,B000AC7P4M,I bought this anime because I'm a fan of Wendee Lee.,1426377600,,52,3.8181818181818183
8077783,4,B000AC7P4M,The Art Box is really cool and the dvds are even better. I was glad to finally own this series and even more impressed to know it was in art box too. The item received was in great condition with no problems. Can't wait to watch. Fast shipping and everything.,1351123200,,259,4.2
8077784,4,B000AC7P4M,"The series, over all, is OK but the extras do add to the value.  Audio commentary on every episode, interviews and bonus material.  Also, the episodes are full of action, fan service and great artwork.  True, it is for 13 year olds and up, but I think younger kids, with an adult, could watch them without too much trouble.
Get it used or new - enjoy!",1246752000,,351,4.287878787878788
8077785,4,B000AC7P4M,"I enjoyed this entire series from start to finish, and not just for the obvious fan service.  I thought the action sequences were well done and the English dubbing was better than most I've seen.  The little kid does get annoying at times but that's her job so I can live with it.  I'd found the first DVD for pretty cheap on its own so it was nice to find the option of buying the third one with the box to hold all three.  As far as this particular DVD, it wraps up the story nicely without leaving any real cliff hangers.  Being a short series there's no real time for origin episodes, but they did their best with the time they had.  All in all, a good series if you're looking for something light, playful, and able to watch all the way through on a lazy Sunday.",1238457600,,767,4.148648648648648
8077786,3,B000AC7P4M,"Tendou Rushuna is a female Senshi with very ample assets, and a knowledge of the handgun that would put and sharp shooter to shame. Her love of baths, her long blonde hair, and her bubbly personality are accented by her seemingly endless supply of ignorance.

Basically, a blonde bimbo with a big gun.

Now don't get me wrong, im all for a gun wielding scantily clad women, but i was also hoping there would be a driving storyline and some plot twists along the way.

Its mostly one misadventure after another until the end when everything comes to an end very abruptly. They did all the could with what they had, and it was an enjoyable 12 episodes, however it won't rank among my favorites.",1232323200,,692,4.52
8077787,4,B000AC7P4M,"As Yajiro, Rushuna, and Mikan continue to journey through the mountains on their way to a final confrontation with Tenshi, Yajiro sees a floating figure in the snow that looks just like a long lost comrade named Fuuka who had accompanied him on a mission years ago. It's implied that she was more than just a friend, but is it really Fuuka, or is it just in his mind? The Jester, Tenshi's personal guard, is also still hanging around, harassing and plotting the deaths of our heroes. What will happen when they finally meet up with Tenshi? Will they get an explanation about why she has seemingly turned away from her dearest beliefs? Or will they get killed before that can happen?

Grenadier was a fun show to watch, even though it could get a little too cute for my tastes, especially after Mikan and her arsenal of balloons joined the cast. But the look back at Yajiro's past is an effective antidote to the fluff and is actually pretty heart-wrenching stuff. The lowpoint of this volume is an underwater battle between Rushuna and a Juttensen which she wins in an entirely unrealistic manner. The rest of the episodes were very well-done both in terms of animation and writing. No matter how serious the subject matter might get in terms of life and death, Rushuna's glowing smile and ""all you need is love"" philosophy, while at times surreal, gives you hope for a better future for all of us.",1158019200,,1398,4.614457831325301
8077788,4,B000AC7P4M,"This is the last DVD in the set for Grenadier.  It covers the apparent dual personality of Lady Tenshi, the identity of Jester, and other tid bits.  The last episodes also bring back several of the characters introduced in the previous dvds.  The animation style is as one would expect from current anime releases neither going above the cut nor is it below what the general audience expects from Japanese anime these days.  There is a Lot of ""fan service"" in the form of bouncing [...] and sexy women.  None of it ever goes over too high for broadcast tv but its still risque (hair falls in censored spots, worse you get is a buttcheek shot).

Still the anime stresses the non-violent dogma that Rushuna believes in.  Also, it is interesting to see how the three main travelling companions have evolved.  For the evolution of the characters, I would give it 3.5 stars.  Unfortunately, amazon doesn't give out 1/2 stars, so I'll round up.

Not recommended for children under high school age.  If you are amused by this series, try Tenchi GXP.",1150156800,,1042,4.670329670329671
