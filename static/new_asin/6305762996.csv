7894099,4,6305762996,This Movie was great! It had my friends and I rolling around on the ground in laughter. Don't expect a hardcore Kung Fu film because this isn't one. But the ridicules fight scenes with impossible moves is just all out fun to watch. To really enjoy this film you have to sit back relax and look at it for how silly it is and not as serious fight film.,997660800,,350,4.086956521739131
