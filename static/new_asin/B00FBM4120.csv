It really gets my heart up there.  I normally use 2 risers with all my other Amy Bento, Seasun Zieger and Cathe workouts, but I only use one riser and still burn just as many calories.  She uses 3 long, creative routines then 2 short ones.  She never puts them all together for a finished product, which made me bummed.  My other huge gripe is that during the stretch at the end, the editor cut out of a back leg stretch, inserted some deep breathing, while she is still discussing the back leg stretch then goes back into the back leg stretch.  I'm really surprised the mistake was not caught and edited-not as professional as her other workouts.  But given all that, I would buy the workout again in a heartbeat.  Truly advanced step workouts are not released very often, so you've got to grab em while you can.",1391817600,3,979,4.383333333333334
