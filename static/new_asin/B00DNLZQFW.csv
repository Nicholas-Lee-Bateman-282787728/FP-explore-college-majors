5836780,1,B00DNLZQFW,"Despite being listed on Amazon as widescreen, the two movies I wanted most (which are broadcast yearly in HD widescreen, (Most Wonderful Time of the Year and Moonlight and Mistletoe) are presented here in the old square TV aspect ratio.  Al the movies here are in low resolution (not even as good as an average DVD) and none of them look as good as they do on TV.  So don't waste your money.",1383955200,37,391,4.342465753424658

5836828,2,B00DNLZQFW,I would LOVE this but the discs do not play through.  Halfway through the first movie it hung up and did not go further no matter what I tried.  Since that was one of the main movies I wanted I am less than happy with the whole pack.  Otherwise it is nice in a can and with a lot of padding but if they do not play not worth what I paid for it.,1486166400,,344,3.6216216216216215

5836857,2,B00DNLZQFW,"My husband and I are obsessed with Christmas movies.  We LOVE most of this collection.  It comes in a nice metal tin worthy of a collector.  HOWEVER, these movies are such low quality, my husband kept telling me to send them back. I did not want to hassle with it, and I grew up with antenna-TV so it doesn't bother me as much.  I was a little embarrassed because I got them for him as a gift, but we DVR'd the movies so he is happy now.  Not quite sure what I'll do with these.  NOT RECOMMENDED due to low quality video.",1480982400,8,521,4.0588235294117645

5836912,1,B00DNLZQFW,"Coming off a five-day Thanksgiving Vacation, I was ambushed by my wife and daughters into watching rotten Hallmark Christmas movies. So, in an effort to give you more time to spend with your families, and waste less time watching them, I will give you the plot of every single movie in just one brief post:

Single woman, usually a mother of a small (and troubled or sick) child, finds herself heading into the Christmas Season without a boyfriend, and usually struggling to make ends meet.  Soon she meets her prince and things look good for the relationship until either (A) a rival of the woman does something,  (B) the disapproving parents of the boyfriend interfere, or (C) a simple misunderstanding breaks up the relationship, and (wouldnt you know it) right before Christmas. The new boyfriend is either (A) tremendously wealthy, (B) poor but cute and wise, or (C) royalty.

Then, a Christmas Miracle occurs to repair the relationship just in time for Christmas, and everyone goes on to live happily ever after. The (town/child in need of operation/struggling business of the woman) is saved!

Finally, if you're a male watching this sissy stuff, turn in your ""man card"" - you'd have to be a wuss to like this!",1448841600,,1217,4.831730769230769
