5261277,5,B0094GMRV6,"I never thought I would admit this. But it actually is less annoying than the original Dino Dan. Same horrific acting, same painfully stupid plot line. But my 3 year old is quiet the entire time it is on. So, yeah. 5 stars from me.",1388793600,,231,4.155555555555556

Not only does it keep him interested but he has learned a lot from it after watching it only once or twice he went from every dinosaur just being a dinosaur to knowing the actual types and nearly getting out the full pronunciation.",1361404800,,378,4.263888888888889
5261285,5,B0094GMRV6,"My 3 year old son LOVES dinosaurs, from his T-Rex flashlight to the full-size remains at our local museums.
This DVD is exactly what we were looking for...a DVD he loves to watch and we love to watch him learn from.
Thanks to Dino Dan, my munchkin just turned 3 and can (accurately) name more dinosaurs by sight than most adults I know.
Not only is he learning about dinosaurs, but he's applying the vocabulary to the world around him.

The DVD has several episodes giving you the option of how much or little he watches without being upset that the show ""wasn't over yet"".
This DVD is now at the top of the rotation and will be for some time to come. I HIGHLY recommend this buy!",1357862400,,680,4.3125
