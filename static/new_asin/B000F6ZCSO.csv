8597162,5,B000F6ZCSO,"I remember watching this episode of C.C. when it was first on..the murderer is such a scumbag, especially when he is being interviewed for the episode, describing his relationship with his wife as ""...having more time for each other.""
It is devasting that his wife was treated so horribly while she was married to him...a classic case of a spousal abuser who should have been dealt with a long time ago.",1262304000,,403,4.690140845070423
