6095020,5,B00GOC74I4,"I never watched this show in primetime, only in syndication. When I saw it being offered by Amazon, I quickly bought. This show has a great ensemble & chemistry. Each actor has their own quirkiness, but David Spade, for me, is the most hilarious. He just feeds off of everyone & zings them.
This show lifts me up when I'm feeling down.
Question, how does Wendy Malick [sp?] look younger now in Hot in Cleveland? Love her sculpted arms, which she still has.
If you want to laugh & like the spin on Cosmo magazine, buy it.",1399766400,4,520,4.371134020618556

6095022,5,B00GOC74I4,"its about time they re-release this show. I love this show, I wished they had more seasons out, which hopefully they do release more out. I own the first 3 seasons so far an still watch them over an over again. the first an second season was a great start off point. one of my favorite episodes on this is ""lemon wacky hello"". in that episode the crew ended up eating this candy from china that has opium in it, its a funny episode. its worth buying an owning, just hope more seasons come out on dvd. the last episode of season 3 was kind of a be continued episode which was kind of a downer since season 3 was the last to be released.",1385942400,4,635,4.088

6095044,5,B00GOC74I4,"This hilarious show has brought me a lot of joy, it's just wonderful comfort food. David Spade, George Segal, Laura San Giacomo, Enrico Colantoni, and Wendie Malick are such a fun group, and the Lemon Wacky Hello episode alone is worth the price of the set. The first season of this show (only a few episodes) isn't as funny as it grew to be, but it still has a lot of heart. The second season really hit the ground running and is full of hearty laughs. Release the later seasons!",1480809600,,480,4.344444444444444

6095065,4,B00GOC74I4,"I'm finding that a lot of these old sitcoms don't really stack up when compared to anything since Seinfeld; i.e., one or at most two subplots, laboriously followed, but Just Shoot Me! is pretty good. I like all of the actors (except one), and they live up to my expectations.",1434672000,2,275,4.52

6095068,5,B00GOC74I4,"Quite funny, even if it's a little dated.  I think this falls pretty much into the category of ""smart-ass"" humor (I wouldn't rate this as family entertainment, but that's just me).  I really like the price on this, also.",1427068800,,220,4.615384615384615
6095069,4,B00GOC74I4,"Just Shoot Me was an under-rated sitcom on NBC's prime time lineup. The cast included Oscar nominee George Segal; Laura San Giacomo; Wendie Malick; Enrico Colantoni; and the fabulous David Spade.

The premise was a fashion magazine named Blush in New York City. Father Jack Gallo (Segal) runs and owns the magazine. When Maya loses her job and is blackballed, she comes to her father. Maya is the antithesis of the magazine's contents so they but heads occasionally. Spade plays Dennis Finch, Jack's trusty assistant. Malick played Nina Van Horn, the fashion editor. Colantoni played Elliott DeMauro, the photographer.

The writing complimented the cast's abilities. The cast appeared to work well together in the series. Guests included Chad Everett, Cheri Oteri, Carmen Electra and others. This series is a lot of fun to watch in syndication and even on DVD.

The first DVD is the 9 episodes in the first season. The second and third DVDs have 11 episodes each. The second season was a full 22 episode season. I believe the series was a midseason replacement in its first season. I remembered and enjoyed the series then and now. I only wished Mill Creek would offer extras.",1422230400,,1176,4.929292929292929
