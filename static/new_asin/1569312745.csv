Also, Ranma's voice is also in Gundam Wing, along with Kunos. And Goku's voice from DBZ is Dr. Tofu in Ranma. Uh oh, we used the same voice actors, I guess that means the entire anime is a flop. My advice to the assumer: watch it subbed, not dubbed. Genius...",1117152000,,458,4.275862068965517
7796985,4,1569312745,"I would of gave it more but they change the voice of Ranma. Who ever has watched Inu Yasha knows who voice it is. Now it's hard for me to look at Ranma with out thinking of Inu yasha. And I have notice some trade marks in Ranma 1/2 that Inu Yasha has as well. Like the nuckles in the hands, the bad attitude, same acting personality that really reminds me of Inu Yasha, But in all it's still good,  but i really wish they didn't change the voice of Ranma. To tell you the truth you should just rent this tape. It's not really worth spending the series. Outta Control series is really not all that great, but it's still funny. And it has some good plots lines in all Ranma series.",1050192000,,679,4.105263157894737
7796986,2,1569312745,"This was the start of the 4th season of the Ranma  series and honestly, I'm a huge fan of the series but this was not at all my favorite one and I was a little let down for a few reasons.
First episode, the Head Master (or Principal) of Ranma and Akane's school (Furinkan HS) has just come back from a long vacation from Hawaii and now he has Hawaiian fever!  He is totally obsessed with the Hawaiian ways, clothes and coconuts?!  The other thing he's obsessed with is the haircut policy after meeting Ranma.  Now he wants to give the boys mandatory crew cuts and the girls bowl cuts.  He's agreed that he will pardon the kids from the nasty haircut if the kids can find a Hall Pass he hid in a coconut.  It's up to Ranma, Akane, Ukyo and Kuno to come through so they can avoid the ugly haircuts.
One Episode 2, the Principal wants to make the halls of Furinkan a little more secure and that all of the students are on time, ALL THE TIME.  So where does he go for help?  He goes to Furinkan's champion Kendo club leader, Kuno.  However knowing that Kuno's track record against Ranma is 0-99,999,999,000 the Head Master from Hell enlists one of Ranma's greatest foes to help out Kuno, the Happosai.  With a little ""training"" from Happosai, Kuno becomes a formidable adversary.  Now the question is, who will bear who?  Will it be Ranma who saves the day again and makes sure that the grip around the HS isn't so tight or will it be the Sword Swinging Kuno?
Like I said, I love the Ranma series but out of the previous 3 lead off episodes/videos, this one was the weakest.  First, the Principal is really annoying, loud and stupid.  Plus he's not that great of an enemy for Ranma.  Aside from the Gambling King, the Principal is the series' dumbest character.  This really bothered me (and other people as well) but the voice of male Ranma has changed drastically (new voice actor).  I didn't think he sounded that great at all.  I will admit that as usual, there are plenty of laughs.  Unless you need this one for collector's purposes, I'd skip this one because honest to God, this is one of the least favorite ones.",1044403200,,2116,4.37948717948718
7796987,4,1569312745,"I am a great Ranma 1/2 fan and I think that this is just another great video. It is a lot like all other videos, a new character comes and makes lots of trouble. This is one of the funniest videos I have seen",964828800,,208,3.75
