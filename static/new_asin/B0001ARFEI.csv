1984283,5,B0001ARFEI,"A friend of mine knew that my husband and I are trying to conceive, so she bought this video for me as a gift.
I cannot express how much I LOVE this video. It is wonderful. I've been doing yoga little over a year and I rank in the intermediate range. I found the video to be clear, peaceful, and interesting. Brenda Strong is a beautiful woman, she has a very kind voice that guides you though the workout and the setting is out in a garden with birds chirping in the background. The moves that are done are very loving to the body and help increase energy around the reproductive areas.
This video is slow paced, effective, loving, and very feminine. I would highly recommend it to any woman.",1042329600,43,693,4.338461538461538
1984284,5,B0001ARFEI,"Being a yoga teacher, I have utilized the postures and philosophy from this DVD with several yoga students who wanted to get pregnant, to wonderful success. In addition, I've purchased the DVD many times to proudly give as a gift to friends and most recently to my daughter-in-law. Brenda Strong's study of yoga for fertility, as well as her calm, encouraging words are a bounty for all.",1323388800,3,387,4.791044776119403
1984285,4,B0001ARFEI,"I'm pretty new to yoga. Not that flexable and not that used to exercising. And I'm overweight, which can make things get in the way during some of these poses.

BUT, I go through the DVD about everyother day. And though I may not be able to do each pose exactly the way she does, I do what I can.

I Know that this program is making me feel better and I can tell I'm getting better at doing the poses every day because I'm getting stronger and more flexable.

I've not tried any other fertility yoga dvds, but I'm happy with the one I bought. I find her voice to be soothing, the moves to be pretty easy for me (a beginner) and its so relaxing! I nearly always follow my afternoon yoga with a nap =)",1304553600,,699,4.050724637681159
1984286,5,B0001ARFEI,"I tried having a baby for 5 years, with 2 failed IUI's and 2 failed IVF's.  I finally gave up and started to do yoga on a regular basis with the DVD.  I didn't have high hopes... but I was amazed when I got pregnant after using this DVD for only 3 months!!!!!  My daughter is 2 now, and I started using this DVD for yoga again to conceive my second child.  I just found out I am pregnant again!",1298419200,13,394,3.8875
1984287,4,B0001ARFEI,"The yoga moves are actually explained in this DVD, which on the mental level, it helps you to understand what each move is for.  The actual movement/practice section runs for about an hour that includes the warm up and warm down.  Although there are no alternative moves for the inflexible, none of the moves are that difficult, bar one ot two, but I would recommend that you stretch as far as you can and don't push it if you can't get there.  There are some yoga moves that are very familiar, if you already down some form of yoga, and there are some non yoga moves that I know I was really loosinging up my second chakra!

It is a great supplement to other fertility yoga treatments and if you have an hour then this is a great option.  The DVD also includes 4x one minute information about the breathe and some very basic information about the benefits of yoga.  The menu allows you jump right into practice after you first seen these mini information sections.",1294790400,,965,4.454545454545454
1984288,5,B0001ARFEI,Wonderful DVD! Used it for one month..and voila...Pregnant! Great for stress relief and your body feels amazing. Brenda has a great voice for narration and you feel really in tune with your body afterwards. Would recommend to anyone trying to concieve or...just getting started with Yoga.,1284249600,,288,5.282608695652174
1984289,5,B0001ARFEI,"I felt relaxed as soon as I heard her voice, and then the back yard soothed me even more.  I use to do yoga and I have a few DVDs, I think this is the best so far.  It's more than yoga.  She adds some qigong, massage, and certain type of yoga breathing.  Her instructions are clear.  It's about an hour long.  Great for de-stressing - I think that so important.  I'm doing it a bit at the time because I'm pretty stiff.  Excellent for just doing yoga and I believe it will help with regards to infertility.",1275177600,,506,4.091836734693878
1984290,5,B0001ARFEI,"I'm so glad I bought this DVD - the workout is really great! And since it is specifically designed to encourage fertility I don't worry about doing this workout while also trying to conceive. (You know how some yoga DVDs have the big warning at the beginning? I didn't feel comfortable doing my old yoga DVDs with that warning on them)
We're only just a few weeks in to ""trying,"" so I can't comment yet on whether or not the workout ""works"" in that regard. But hopefully I can amend my review soon with that news!
It is a really great yoga DVD even just on its own as a workout, so that is a bonus.",1274140800,,598,4.163793103448276
1984291,5,B0001ARFEI,"I used the workout on this video for 5 months and got pregnant at 45. Everyone that I have given this DVD to that has used it regularly in a regimen of exercise and a healthy diet has gotten pregnant. The DVD is very calming. The routine is not difficult. The routine is not long. However, it can be broken up into 2 segments if you have limited time for exercise. I definitely recommend this DVD.",1272067200,13,397,4.2368421052631575
1984292,1,B0001ARFEI,This DvD is the pirated version of Brenda Strong's Yoga 4 Fertility.  The current DVD version is the one with Brenda in pink top and blue pants.  Shame on you Amazon.,1270598400,2,166,4.32258064516129
1984293,4,B0001ARFEI,"I have 2 Yoga DVDs for fertility.  The other one is ""Bend, Breathe, and Conceive"" with Anna Davis.  I enjoy both and like to alternate them for variety and also to give my body a break.  ""Yoga 4 Fertility"" with Brenda Strong does a lot of downward facing dog and forward bends.  I find this somewhat strenuous on my shoulders and especially my neck so it's nice to do the other DVD on alternate days to give those parts of my body a rest.  The workout is good though and focuses on stretching your waste and hips which is universally good for fertility.  Brenda does a very good job of talking you through the exercises so you'll know what to do even if you're not able to look at the TV screen.  There is no music, which personally is a relief because sometimes it can be cheesy and distracting.  Instead, you hear sounds of nature and birds chirping.  I find this DVD enjoyable and relaxing.  The only minor criticism I have is that the relaxation at the end is abbreviated but Brenda suggests pausing the DVD for a few minutes.",1270252800,2,1030,4.373684210526315
1984294,4,B0001ARFEI,"I bought this DVD along with Yoga Practices for Fertility, which I slightly preferred to Yoga 4 Fertility. Still, since I need a little variety, this is one that I could see using repeatedly. When I got the DVD from Amazon, I thought I recognized the instructor - turns out she is one of the characters on Desperate Housewives, the narrator. She spends a lot of time at the beginning providing background and explaining the benefit of the yoga routine. The movement section is just Brenda in what looks like her backyard. It starts out very slowly with a lot of moves to loosen the lower back and hips. Sometimes I skip that part if I'm shorter on time. There are some moves that are very specific to fertility, such as massaging your ovaries and directly energy toward your reproductive organs. At the end I feel limber and relaxed. I've been practicing yoga a few times a week for over 6 months so I found it easy to do, but complete beginners may find the routine a bit challenging.

One thing I didn't like was how the menu was set up - there is a lot of talking prior to the actual yoga practice, and there isn't a way to start at the beginning of the routine without having to fast forward through Brenda talking. The other slight drawback for me was that this was very geared toward women only and I don't think my husband would have felt comfortable joining me in this practice.",1254268800,3,1386,4.435294117647059
1984295,4,B0001ARFEI,"I recently returned from a very expensive retreat for fertily.  We were taught about 30 mins over an entire weekend of yoga, with no way to remember like a video, what to do when we got home.  This video is wonderful and fits exactly what they were trying to teach.  Soooo...I highly recommend this yoga for fertility!",1229040000,,318,4.543859649122807
1984296,4,B0001ARFEI,"I have used this fertility yoga dvd and enjoyed it.  Not surprisingly Brenda Strong's voice is very soothing and warm.  Some of the poses are a little difficult (even when I wasn't in the middle of a cycle) but overall, the background and her explanations of the poses are great.",1224720000,,279,4.56
1984297,5,B0001ARFEI,"I highly recommend this DVD. It's very relaxing, but it's a great workout as well! I love the routine. Brenda is an amazing instructor. She explains every detail and is really very calm, nice and encouraging. She is a lovely person to have in your living room :-)

This DVD may be a bit difficult for beginners with short hamstrings, but it's not a problem to bend your knees!

You need just a yoga mat. No other equipment which is great.",1211932800,5,438,4.395061728395062
1984298,5,B0001ARFEI,"I enjoyed the practice and the pace of this DVD. The instructor had a  soothing voice and I found it very relaxing. I can't say if really helps with fertility and more than any other Yoga practice as I just found out I was pregnant before it arrived!(After 1 1/2 yrs trying) Perhaps all you have to do is ORDER the DVD and then you'll get pregnant!:-) Seriously though, I was already practicing a lot of Yoga and having energy healing treatments. I do believe Yoga and energy work will help. Good Luck! I liked it much better than ""Fertility Yoga"" with Monica Morrell. You can read my review on that one!",1206489600,6,604,4.392857142857143
1984299,5,B0001ARFEI,"I'm a novice to yoga, and have been doing the yoga on ""Yoga 4 Fertility"" for two weeks now.  I am very impressed by the program.  The instructor, Brenda Strong, clearly explains all of the positions and demonstrates these in a very peaceful garden setting.  She provides well-timed cues to prepare you for the next move, and offers helpful hints to get you to move to greater levels of stretching and flexibility.  Her voice is both calming and encouraging. I truly look forward to doing the program each time, and find myself incredibly relaxed by the end.  As an unanticipated bonus, in just two weeks, I've noticed that my posture and flexibility have improved.

Brenda Strong has been an advocate for fertility issues for years, and is a board member of the American Fertility Association.  At the beginning of the DVD, there is an informative section about how yoga can contribute to enhancing fertility.  This section can be skipped on subsequent viewings. The actual yoga program shares four steps: observation - helping you become aware of where you unconsciously hold tension; breath - a great tutorial on how to use ujjayi breath to calm the nervous system linking mind and body; movement - using yoga to activate the relaxation response, releasing tension and balancing hormones; and surrender  - simply letting go in each moment and being present.  The program takes about 50 minutes  to complete - longer if you pause the DVD for additional stretching or final resting and relaxation.

A word of caution:  there are several versions of this DVD available.  The copy with the photo of the woman in the dark leotard on the front is a PIRATED version. The version with the photo of a woman (Brenda Strong) in light blue pants and a pink top is the most recent version.  I HIGHLY recommend that version of the DVD.",1205107200,19,1823,4.798076923076923
1984300,5,B0001ARFEI,"This DVD is excellent for relaxing! She takes time to explain every pose, even the breathing technique in detail. I have only been using it for three weeks and already noticed some ""shifts"", so to speak. I will say some of the moves are more advanced, even as I have been practicing with a yoga class during the week. I am really enjoying this DVD!
Best of luck for healthy babies in 2008,
Jamie Lynne",1201737600,5,401,4.36
1984301,4,B0001ARFEI,I like the yoga workout but Im new with the yoga positions so I was trying to keep up and understand the moves. The explaination on the breathing technique was excellent.,1196380800,,170,4.516129032258065
1984302,3,B0001ARFEI,"I tried to use this DVD at least 3 times a week when I first bought it.  I have been practicing yoga for over a year; I wanted to add something else to my routine to increase my chances for conceiving.  However, I found a couple of the poses to be so painful for me, that I became discouraged from doing the practice.  As one other reviewer noted, there are no modifications for a novice.  Not as relaxing as my weekly practice with an actual instructor... but I will try to stay with it.",1194048000,4,488,4.159574468085107
1984303,4,B0001ARFEI,I attend Yoga classes twice a week but I bought this video to see moves to focus on fertilty.  This routine has diffcult parts but I enjoy it very much.  And in the end I am totally relaxed.  I would not suggest this to women who have never done Yoga before.  Or if you haven't try sections of the video before doing the entire thing at once.  Anything to help me relax in this process is helpful.,1190678400,8,397,4.103896103896104
1984304,3,B0001ARFEI,"For someone who's been trying to have a baby and NOT very flexible. I think this dvd is a bit hard, especially the forward bends! Don't get me wrong I LOVE BRENDA STRONG and her need to help people conceive. It's just her positions are hard to get done and I feel like I'm not completing her exercises, therefore, really stressed out thinking if i can't do this correctly how can i conceive. I'm sure some of you would understand what I mean. - I found a DVD with a few similar positions (with help for people who can't bend so much) its called Yoga for Weightloss. I would play the DVD and then pause it so I may add the positions in Ms. Strongs dvd that I could do and think might be important. I find it less stressful for me to do. I hope this helps anyone else in my position (ha!)",1181347200,2,786,4.1103896103896105
1984305,5,B0001ARFEI,"I haven't used it much since I bought it but I found it easy to follow and extremely relaxing.  I have never done yoga before using this DVD.  The DVD taught me about a certain kind of breathing (can't remeber the name, something like oojiyee breath), but I can honestly say that I have never found a way to make myself so relaxed.  Half of the time I followed the DVD, I quit half way through, got in bed and went to sleep because it made me so relaxed, which is exactly what I was looking for - a way to reduce stress.",1168041600,10,520,4.029126213592233
1984306,2,B0001ARFEI,"The yoga routine in this DVD has a very high level of difficulty. You would already need to be a super-flexible yogini to be able to perform most of the moves.  Brenda Strong very rarely suggests modifications, and she sounds critical of those who can't do the poses as perfectly as she can.  For example, she will say ""if your hamstrings are so inflexible that you can't so-and-so.""  They only show Brenda doing the poses, rather than a range of people.  I much prefer the Monica Morrell video, because Monica seems to be more of an expert in this area, the poses are much more doable, and it shows a few different women doing the poses.",1160438400,16,638,4.474137931034483
1984307,5,B0001ARFEI,"Not having practiced yoga in the past, I was pleasantly surprised that the poses presented here were easy to execute after only a few attempts.  I now look forward to using this DVD to relax, especially before bedtime.  It appears to help me sleep better, clear the sinuses (!), and increase flexibility.  My running workouts (I am a half-marathoner) have even been enhanced since I began using this DVD.  I am hoping that this practice will positively affect fertility by improving my overall health and well-being.  I'm not pregnant yet, though!",1135209600,8,547,4.967032967032967
1984308,4,B0001ARFEI,I really enjoyed this DVD and the ultimately am glad that I bought it.  I have used this DVD on and off for about two months.  It is peaceful and calming.  It did not help me with my fertility though because I have discovered that I am not ovulating regularly. Yoga does not help with that. I will continue with the yoga while seeing my fertility doctor.,1123113600,8,354,4.253731343283582
1984309,4,B0001ARFEI,"The journey to conception can sometimes be stressful, and from what I understand, stress is supposed to be kept to a minimum in order for your hormones to function properly.  This DVD is very relaxing, while effective in opening up blocked areas of your body.  Brenda Strong's intentions are so positive, and it feels like you're doing yoga with a friend.  The only thing that I would change is how fast she goes through some of the poses, but that's where my ""pause"" button comes in handy!",1110412800,10,490,4.609195402298851
1984310,4,B0001ARFEI,"I have been doing Brenda Strong's ""Yoga for Fertility"" practice for about 3 months now. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 2 years, and although I'm not naive enough to think this will be the magic answer to our struggles, it's nice to know there is a yoga practice out there specifically geared towards women who are experiencing difficulty conceiving.

 I found the poses to be easy to learn (I'm more of an aerobics person, not a yoga person), and they have increased my flexibility tenfold, which I never thought would happen. The breathing techniques really do relax you as you're doing the practice, and I feel like I'm doing something different and good for my body. Brenda Strong has a calm, soothing voice and explains the poses very well, which I think is important for a first-timer like myself.

 The only thing that I was a bit put off from in this DVD is that at the very end of the practice, during the ""surrender"" portion, she suggests you turn off or pause for 5-10 minutes to fully relax. I feel like it sort of defeats the purpose to have to watch out for time, so I never surrender for that long! Other than that, I do this practice basically every day, and it is something I look forward to each morning.",1090281600,52,1245,4.447368421052632
1984311,5,B0001ARFEI,This is the best yoga tape I have ever done.  I feel more at peace now than I ever have during this search for fertility.,1074038400,3,121,3.84

8009286,3,B0001ARFEI,Didn't work for me.  Still I nice workout.,1429920000,,42,4.25
8009287,5,B0001ARFEI,11 years ago February I started doing yoga with this video every night. We were pregnant by the end of May. I have shared this video many many times and the women who have exercised regularly with Brenda became pregnant.,1429747200,,220,4.525
8009288,4,B0001ARFEI,Very nicely done yoga session. Only one disadvantage of this DVD - after watching it for the first time it is difficult to start the DVD from the beginning of the exercise (skipping the introduction) as it is located in the middle of the sector/block on the DVD so trying to get to the right spot  forwarding was a challenge.,1423526400,,325,4.416666666666667
8009289,5,B0001ARFEI,"Yoga4Fertility was the first yoga video that I actually loved doing. I love Brenda Strong's calming, mother-like voice. She also was the first one to teach me how to breath properly. I highly recommend this yoga video.",1422576000,,218,4.918918918918919
8009290,5,B0001ARFEI,I found this dvd great when I was trying to get pregnant. It was great at stress management and self care reflections. I loved all the moves and will start this dvd when I look to conceive again.,1416355200,,195,4.157894736842105

8009292,5,B0001ARFEI,The exercises are excellent and easy to make. It made me feel good. I just hoped it would have some relaxing music to go along with.,1395187200,,132,4.115384615384615
8009293,5,B0001ARFEI,Brenda Strong's voice is soothing and relaxing. The poses are not too difficult and the pace of the yoga is well timed. She explains the benefits of many poses and how they encourage fertility. Best wishes to all TTC.,1388016000,,217,4.589743589743589
8009294,3,B0001ARFEI,The video was good and Brenda Strong did a good job of explaining everything in detail so you know what you're doing.  Some of the moves were a little more advanced for me since I don't practice yoga regularly but I did find it doable.,1359504000,3,235,4.222222222222222
