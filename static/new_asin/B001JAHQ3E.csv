3653049,4,B001JAHQ3E,"FAMILY TIES was a comical sitcom about a Midwestern family that lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio from a cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's that foremost expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic Mallory(Justine Bateman), tomboyish Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross).

FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and even won various awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

This 1988-89 Season was also the last season of them all since it cancelled in the Spring of 1989 after 7 wonderful seasons and 180 lovely episodes and I was so bummed out when I got word that NBC was showing FAMILY TIES series-finale episode on Sunday May 14, 1989 since the ratings seemed strong enough for an 8th Season to be underway, but apparently the Keatons were getting tired and the cast and crew of the show had ran out of steam.

FAMILY TIES final season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 16 years old and a Sophomore in high school and when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to the Best"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1988 thru the Summer of 1990.

3653109,5,B001JAHQ3E,"This was a great TV series with so many great family and other important issues addressed, but with smart/unoffensive humor.  About the only show on now that is anywhere close to it is ""The Middle"".  Watching Family Ties is very nostalgic for me as well, as I grew up in the 80's.  I watched the first probably 4-5 seasons, then life got busy.  It's sort of neat to go back and find out how things ended on the show and for all the characters.  Also interesting to look back on some of the individual characters, knowing some of the dramatic twists their real lives have taken.",1454457600,,577,4.40566037735849

3653151,4,B001JAHQ3E,"I remember growing up with this series and it was truly fun to watch.  While some of the scenarios may be a little out there, there was some grain of truth and you did get the feeling that everyone in the family was supporting others in their own way.  Parents--if you have the time and see a few episodes with your kids that at least relate to what you are going through.  Even if you don't, some are just fun to see.",1444176000,,418,4.073170731707317

3653222,4,B001JAHQ3E,I chose this ratings because it was a catch up and final season after the Writer's Strike.  Mrs Keaton couldn't stop Alex from leaving home after graduation.  It wouldn't work.,1402012800,,176,4.833333333333333
3653223,5,B001JAHQ3E,I loved watching this show years ago and still do. The episodes are still funny. I do not care for their 'liberal' point of view but I love the caring of each family member that is woven through out the series. Wish they made shows like this now!,1400112000,,246,4.145833333333333
3653224,5,B001JAHQ3E,"Love most of the old citcomes from back then. Alex and father have the best acting. Was final season and end was sad , but final episode was slight let down",1396396800,,156,4.064516129032258
3653225,4,B001JAHQ3E,I am a huge fan of Michael J. Fox. This really is one of his best shows of all time. I love the ones where Alex is moving away from his family off to move to NYC.,1395705600,,162,3.4054054054054053

3653250,5,B001JAHQ3E,"I had been looking for the Last of the Family Ties to come out, so I could compete the set of shows, if was one of my shows growing up. Most of the stores didn't carry it and had to order online, but was much higher than at Amazon.",1382313600,,231,3.7346938775510203
3653251,4,B001JAHQ3E,"It was great to finally see the last season released on DVD after a long wait. Overall I liked the DVD set in that the picture and audio quality for all of the episodes were very good. I believe this last season was recorded in stereo (new to TV broadcasts in 1988-89), and it appears they preserved the audio track. It was also great seeing the final episode uncut instead of divided into two parts like it was for syndication, and I especially liked seeing the cast come out and take their final bows as I saw back in May 1989 when it first aired.

The only disappointments I have with this last season is that there weren't any extras included. It would've been nice to hear some thoughts from the cast & crew about that final season and how they came to the decision to end the show at that point. Particularly since creator Gary David Goldberg has passed away and sadly will no longer be able to share any more stories about this show.

Still, though, it's nice to have the complete series on DVD at last. Some notable guest appearances this season include Jane Adams (who later played Mel on Fraiser), Maura Tierny (though I never watched that show, I recongized the name), and Dan Hedaya (played Carla's ex-husband Nick Tortelli on Cheers).",1380067200,4,1247,4.513274336283186
3653252,5,B001JAHQ3E,"What a great series!  Not all comedies actually make me laugh, but this one sure does.  Now, thanks to Amazon, I have all seven seasons in DVD format.",1379548800,,150,4.321428571428571
3653253,5,B001JAHQ3E,This show is a must have if you enjoy shows with family Michael J fox does a spectacular job playing Alex Keaton and the series finale is great,1379376000,,143,4.142857142857143
3653254,4,B001JAHQ3E,"Finally, I own all seven seasons!
  Having waited and waited to buy the sixth and seventh seasons of Family Ties, I was finally able to get Season 6 in April and Season 7 in August.  Of course, I watched all the episodes of Season 7 in rapid succession, and I enjoyed most of them very much.  I think that Gary Goldberg realized in Season 7 what he didn't quite get in Season 6...that the members of this family are all older now and that their concerns can't be the same as they were when the show started years before.  Of course, the humor and the irrepressible Alex P. Keaton are essential, but the shows deal with serious themes as well.  Steven's heart attack is a three-episode event that doesn't leave much room for humor, and the theme of racism is tackled when Steven's black co-worker and his family move into the Keatons' neighborhood.  In the final episodes, Alex is off to his dream job in NYC, and the other Keaton children aren't far behind in leaving the nest (with the exception of Andy), and so Family Ties comes to a very natural and appropriate end when Alex bids his family farewell to leave for the Big Apple.  Season 7 is very satisfying and a great improvement over some of the rather silly and inane episodes in Season 6.",1378512000,11,1247,4.43859649122807
3653255,5,B001JAHQ3E,A big thank you to CBS/Paramount for releasing the last two seasons of this excellent series! Finally my DVD collection of my all-time favorite show will be complete!!!!,1377907200,2,169,5.071428571428571
3653256,3,B001JAHQ3E,"The set is fine -- just like the other sets. I was happy to see the entire cast come out in the final episode. It was moving to see all the actors crying. In the grand scheme of things, though, I only bought this so I could say I had the entire series. The only truly memorable episode is the final one.",1376956800,3,303,3.903225806451613

3653258,5,B001JAHQ3E,I was so glad when Paramount/CBS decided to finally put out the rest of this series. This was my favorite show during the 1980's.  As a teen I had a crush on Mallory/Justine Bateman.  I even got to go to a taping while serving in the Army in California. In fact I still have the autographed T-shirt (signed by everybody) that I won for singing the theme song at the taping.  I jumped right to the last episode when my DVD set came in the mail and let me tell you that you will not be disappointed.  From what I can tell this is the original episode and not a cut down version.  Paramount/CBS did the fans right on this one.  The final curtain call is included at the end of the episode.  I don't think it was included in the re-runs nor is it in the netflix streaming version of the episode.  I emailed CBS years ago when they first started releasing the show on DVD and ask that they include the curtain call on the DVD if they ever put out the final season and it looks like someone actually paid attention.  Please buy the DVD and finish your collection of this great series.  Thank you Paramount/CBS for releasing the rest of the series and for doing it right.,1376438400,16,1164,4.226244343891403
