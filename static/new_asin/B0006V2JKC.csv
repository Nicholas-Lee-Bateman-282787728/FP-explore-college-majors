8043534,4,B0006V2JKC,"I have had the video cassettes for these for years and can see the end of the vcr era just around the corner.  Figured I better get them in dvd format to keep the entertainment around a few years longer.  Lots of good footage, lots of neat places and a bunch of beginner tips and stuff I didn't care for in between.  Dvd makes it nice to skip ahead or fast forward.  Glad to have them around until the next big technological advancement makes them obsolete.",1422489600,,457,4.27906976744186
