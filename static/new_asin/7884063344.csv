7900836,1,7884063344,There are a lot of bootleg versions of the Ghibli movies on Amazon.  Most are of dubious quality and definitely illegal.  They usually come without any extra features and have been pixelated due to copying and adding subtitles.,1413590400,,227,4.947368421052632
7900837,3,7884063344,"Well Im giving this 3 stars because it did include the 6 disks listed. However upon removing the outside cover box inside is a cheap fabric covered cardboard box that fell apart upon removing from the cover. the disks are inside this in 6 flimsy plastic sleeves (like what would be inside a cd book) no plastic cdcases for the disks, no info inserts, just 6 disks stacked in flimsy plastic sleeves. perhaps my expectations were too high but basically im just left with the option of buying a cd book so they don't get scratched. it would of been nice to have had them individually packaged in disk cases. Very cheaply done for 50$.",1304726400,10,631,4.495652173913044
