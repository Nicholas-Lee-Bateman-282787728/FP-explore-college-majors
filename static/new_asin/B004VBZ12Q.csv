8443185,5,B004VBZ12Q,"In fact this film was indicated by my girlfriend. So after this, I really needed to see if it was a great film. Well... it is a kind of love story, a bit sad but it was very nice for a German movie. I strongly recommend you to buy this movie. Sometimes you probably will laught a lot, the cast is nice and the policeman and Emma are very  funny.  Concluding... you can try this to get out of commercial circuit and have a bit fun with a unusual film.",1339459200,,450,3.988888888888889
