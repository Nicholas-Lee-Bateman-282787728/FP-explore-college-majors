7857121,3,6303927858,"This was the first in a series of movies that went under the title of ""Onna hissatsu-ken,"" or ""Lethal Fist of the Woman,"" intended to showcase the talents of Shihomi Etsuko, a female Japanese martial artist trained in Shaolin Kenpo.  It is not a Sonny Chiba film, and as other reviewers have pointed out, he only has a small part.
That said, the movie is best enjoyed on its own campy terms.  It takes itself perfectly seriously, although it's nothing more than a pastiche of elements swiped from contemporary Hong Kong films-- and pretty much every villain tries his level best to imitate Bruce Lee's deadpan fighting style.  In true Japan style, however, the fights are over the top, extremely bloody, and sometimes just ridiculous.  In short, it's hilarious.  The fights get more and more brutal (and laughable) as the day-glo blood pours.  This movie is sure to satisfy those looking for surreal, cheesy fun, but certainly won't appeal to people looking for a high-quality martial arts film.  I really enjoy watching the star, since she always manages to appear so sincere in her roles and isn't a bad martial artist.  Sadly, her talents were squandered in increasingly formulaic and silly movies.
Please note that I can't vouch for the quality of this release, since I've only seen the Japanese original.",1059868800,3,1309,4.891402714932127
7857122,1,6303927858,"THIS GIRL CAN FIGHT, BUT FIRST OF ALL, WHY DID THEY SHORTEN CHIBA'S PRESENCE TO A CAMEO JUST TO DEVOTE A MOVIE TO A GIRL WHO CAN'T HOLD HER OWN AGAINST HALF THE MEN IN THE MARTIAL ARTS INDUSTRY? HERE'S THE WACK PLOT; A COP DISSAPEARS WHILE TRYING TO BUST A MAJOR DRUG CARTEL, AND IT'S UP TO HIS SISTER TO FIND HIM. DON'T BE FOOLED. DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF SONNY CHIBA'S PICTURE ON THE COVER, CHIBA VERY SELDOMLY APPEARS IN THIS ONE. LET'S FACE IT, THIS ONE RUINED WHAT COULD'VE BEEN A BETTER SERIES OF SEQUELS. NOW REALLY, I FIND IT STUPID THAT THIS GIRL CAN FIGHT HER WAY THROUGH ALL THESE MEN LIKE IT'S ALMOST NOTHING. THE FILMMAKERS REALLY SHOULD'VE THOUGHT LONG AND HARD BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE SONNY CHIBA AS THE STAR FOR THIS LAME GIRL. HOPEFULLY, THEY WOULD LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES BY THE TIME ''THE STREET FIGHTER'S LAST REVENGE'' WAS RELEASED.",1059177600,,861,4.490445859872612
7857123,4,6303927858,"Martial arts film is a beautiful genre.  Seagal, Van Damme, they've ruined it, made it into the ""action movie"", which [is bad].
Sister Street Fighter is a VERY good 70s martial arts film, starring Sue Shiomi.  It is very stylish, with good cinematography, and well-choreographed fight scenes.  This is some of the last and greatest kung-fu filmmaking.  Sonny Chiba has about 3 fight scenes (he is not the star), all of which rock.  Your basic kidnap/revenge plot...  there are FIGHTING AMAZONS...!!!!  Not a waste of money, despite what that narcoleptic guy said.",1057449600,2,563,5.054347826086956
7857124,2,6303927858,"Well, honestly I fell asleep about half way thru the movie. It was given to me as a present so I didn't waste my money. You are better of buying something else. This was the first time I've seen a Sonny Chiba movie, and I was not impressed.",1053648000,,240,4.020833333333333
7857125,5,6303927858,"I'm a fan of the STREET FIGHTER films, starring Sonny Chiba. This psuedo-sequel has him playing a different character, who's on screen for only about 15 or so minutes, and makes way for Sue Shiomi (aka Etsuko Shiomi) to make haer own story. Her character is Tina, a girl who goes looking for her brother, whose been kidnapped by drug dealers. She's not the shoot-em-up type, of course, but she is the most dangerous girl you'll ever meet, because she can karate chop you death like that. This was definitely equal to the other STREET FIGHTER films, and way past the third one, LAST REVENGE. Shiomi's a babe and knows martial arts like few women do. It's not exactly sqeaky clean, but it just plain ROCKS!!!",1053388800,,706,4.611111111111111
7857126,4,6303927858,"While bearing little to no resemblance to the three Sonny Chiba/Street Fighter films, this last entry is the best in the series.
The simplistic plot is: Shihomi goes to find her missing brother, an undercover agent kidnapped by drug smugglers. She begins to nose around, and incurs the wrath of the main dope fiend and his silly henchmen. They smuggle heroin to the rest of the world in wigs. Her uncle rats her out, thanks to a convenient rape of his daughter, and she is thought dead, but comes back in time to find her brother and defeat the army of villains, with the chauvinist help of Sonny Chiba.
I do not think this was an official ""Street Fighter"" entry because Chiba has a handful of scenes, and his character's name is different from the first three films. The karate school and its instructor, all major forces in the first three films, has been replaced by a different instructor and karate school (which has a swastika as its emblem, I know it was a religious symbol first, but it is still unsettling). Chiba's role is a glorified cameo, and he spends most of his screen time telling various women their place is in the kitchen.
Shihomi, who had a tiny part in the third film, and was killed off early, is excellent here. This is not exactly Lady Macbeth, but she is cute and can kick the sushi out of any man around. The film has more fight scenes than the first three films combined, the action is literally non-stop.
The silly villains look like they stepped out of an old 1960's ""Batman"" episode. They have colorful names like Hammerhead, and wear shiny costumes and silly phallic helmets that are more funny than threatening. Another weak scene is the graphic rape scene. While Sue's uncle is forced to watch, his daughter is raped by a giggling fat guy so the uncle will rat out Shihomi. The whole film is very violent, but this little piece of ugliness was completely uncalled for. Also, where is it written that all police and detectives must meet their informants in strip clubs, just so we have to see bare breasts? Just wondering, since even this foreign made film gets into the same routine.
This is definitely the best of the series, and I even think it can be watched by anyone who has not seen the first three films in the series, you will no find any closure here. Sister is doing it for herself!
Rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual violence, female nudity, some sexual content, and drug references.",1022803200,2,2454,4.592255125284738
7857127,3,6303927858,"I first saw the beautiful and deadly protegee of the great Sonny Chiba in Chiba's brutal karate cult-classic,THE STREETFIGHTER.Though her appearance was brief,it was certainly cool to see her pit her skills against Chiba. She now comes into her own as the lethal SISTER STREETFIGHTER.
Although in no way connected to THE STREETFIGHTER films series by story or character,(Sonny Chiba co-stars in the film but not as Terry Tsurugi,The Streetfighter.)it gives Sue Shiomi a chance to shine all on her own,but of course with a little help from Chiba.
This movie has a few dull,even awkward moments but with spell-binding action scenes that wll keep your eyes glued to the screen. Overall,I found SISTER STREETFGHTER to be an entertaining film featuring who I consider to be one of the best as the most underrated female martial arts film stars. I also recommend the film,DRAGON PRINCESS,with another entertaining performance by Sue Shiomi...",1014336000,,936,5.2052980132450335
