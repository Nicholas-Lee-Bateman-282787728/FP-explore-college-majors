462815,5,630243078X,This is the best movie I have ever seen. Melanie Griffth and Michael Douglas were excellent. The two of them had excellent chemistry that showed through so well. The movie also documented World War Two so well. It was so  exciting and action filled. I loved this movie so much that I feel like I  could watch it everyday and never get sick of it.,946339200,,346,4.3076923076923075
462816,4,630243078X,"For all this movie has been poorly reviewed by the professionals, I felt it has mass appeal to anyone who enjoys a mystery/suspense based on war efforts.  Michael Douglas did what he does best, intimidates and charms,  and Melanie Griffith was very genuine and talented in her portrayal of a  woman in love as well as that of a newbie spy.  Liam Neeson is his unique  gentlemanly self, much more attractive than in Schindlers List.  Germany  during the bombing is expectedly dull, but the filming was well done.",944697600,3,511,4.738636363636363
462817,5,630243078X,I saw this movie last year and absolutely loved it. I love suspense and romance and this film does an excellent job of combining the two. Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith make a wonderful duo on screen. The movie  keeps you on the edge of your seat all of the way up to the dramatic  ending.,943228800,4,295,4.25
462818,3,630243078X,"I just saw this movie for the first time. I confess i only wanted to see it because I heard it was terrible and thought it would be kinda fun for  that reason. I was pleasantly suprised to find it is a pretty good  suspense/drama. Melanie griffith is not bad, despite her babydoll voice.  Michael Douglas is kinda stiff though. The film is beautifully directed and  photographed. Not so bad after all.",941328000,,401,4.527777777777778

462904,5,630243078X,"Shining Through was based on a huge bestseller from Susan Isaacs. It is a favorite novel of mine.  Needless to say I went to see the movie on opening weekend. Melanie Griffith and Michael Douglas do a wonderful job in the lead roles. The story based in the New York, Washington DC and Berlin, Germany is very interesting.  Liam Neeson, Joely Richardson and John Gielgud all have important supporting roles and are wonderful. Although the movie is presented as an action/melodrama set in World War II, the romantic story is what makes this movie so enjoyable. Griffith and Douglas have good believable chemistry. The set direction and cinematography are a throwback to the old 1940's movies.  If you like romantic stories with just enough action and mystery thrown in, watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.",1513555200,,815,4.934306569343065

462906,5,630243078X,"A great film. I don't know why it is not on bluray. This DVD does pretty well though as far as picture quality. The story revolves around the leading lady and to me is all about the beauty of women. It's the way that she is presented and her view of the war. The way that the character is presented is just beautiful. Based on a book written by a woman and my favorite film. I love the other actors in the film. I think it's a great family film with slight, breif sex and nudity. I do not see why it got a lot of bad reviews at the time. I find it totally plausible and completely well done.",1506470400,2,591,3.933333333333333
462907,5,630243078X,Outstanding story - could have almost been believably true.  Excellent acting - very talented set of actors.  Very small bit of language could be muted out - did nor ruin enjoy-ability of time spent watching this movie. The acting delivery made the movie watcher think these were the real people in real life. It was that  good. Everybody seemed to get their fair share (5 minutes of Fame) in front of the camera. The script was well  packaged with a surprise ending - and a good one that - provided a warm feeling about what could have easily been just one of many true stories that took place during early years of  WW2 at the spy level.  You won't be disappointed with time spent on this movie.,1504742400,,697,4.448818897637795

462959,5,630243078X,Not only do I own this movie I also watched it on prime because I moved and it was still packed away one night when the mood hit me. I love this movie. I love the history and the romance and the whole 9 yards! If you are into romance and drama about the second world war and the hitler regime this is a flick for you! Both of the main charactures were well portrayed by the stars! A perfect flick for anyone!,1502323200,2,408,3.927710843373494

462966,5,630243078X,"I love this movie. Recently, I read many reviews that stated it was a very bad movie, collecting a lot of RASBERRIES. It's entertaining, and it appeals to many different ages. For the past twenty years, I've shown this movie to my AP European history classes after they take the exam in May. The kids, who are just finishing the tenth grade, love it...boys and girls alike. It's entertainment not a documentary. They can sit back (or sit on the edges of their seats) and just enjoy! It's a winner despite what the sophisticated movie critics may think.",1494892800,,552,4.642857142857143

462995,4,630243078X,"Takes place in the European theater in WW2. Was a good movie. There are some good twists so I won't comment much and a bit of romance as well. Great acting by all three main characters. It stars Michael Douglass Melanie Griffith and Liam Neeson.

It is what I would call a romantic suspense spy thriller. Much of the story takes place behind the lines in war torn Germany.

When replacing VHS tapes this was one of the first I ordered. Good value. If you order you won't be disappointed.",1488672000,2,487,4.4

463132,1,630243078X,"*****SPOILERS*****Wow. This movie is mind numbingly, eye-rollingly and embarrassingly bad. It just gets worse and worse and less believable the longer it goes on.  And it goes on and on. At the beginning, the ""heroine"" is being interviewed for the BBC and looks like present day (90s) except she looks way to young if she was around 30 ish during the early part of WWII. Then one would think the character would have told the story enough times that she'd be able to speak a little faster. Every word drags on like she can barely remember it or worse like she's really slow mentally. Going back to the beginning and how she got involved with the war, one of her early triumphs is that she ""cracks"" the ""code"" her boss is using to write spy communications, which was so bad a four year old could have cracked it. She's a pathetic weekling and hysterical woman who makes an idiot of herself in a public place over her boss who dumped her. Then she goes into Nazi Germany as a ""spy"" with absolutely no training. She doesn't blend, trusts everyone, and thinks a German woman can walk into a slum with two Aryian kids and visit her Jewish relatives who are in hiding. OMG. Seriously? Liam Neeson's character decides she's a spy because she pretended not to know a woman who is a close friend of Hitler's. She could have played it to her advantage but the character is extremely stupid. She eludes the whole gestspo, then gets shot in the stomach and somehow doesn't die with no surgery or medical care. There are just so many things wrong with this movie and its so bad that I'm actually boring myself to death writing about it. Read the book, which was actually pretty good and much more credible.",1474156800,,1693,4.514657980456026

463134,2,630243078X,"Don't be deceived by the positive reviews for this film here and elsewhere. This so-called drama is really a melodrama cum chick flick. Michael Douglas plays Ed Leland, a top level New York lawyer who is also a top level spy for the United States into Germany prior to and during WWII. He holds the rank of colonel. Nevertheless despite his elite education and high rank in the military intelligence, Leland can't read, write or speak German. You know, that's kind of like being Vice President of Ford Motor Company but not knowing how to drive an automobile - happens all the time. Melanie Griffith plays Linda Voss, a kid with no education from the Bronx who has no problem winning the affections of an elite lawyer and colonel in the armed forces. This kind of thing, too, happens all the time. Leland agrees to use Voss, who DOES speak German, in an covert operation into Germany to uncover the plans for the V-2 Rocket. Since in real life, Germany managed to launch over 3,000 V-2 rockets against the Allies, it is hard to see what Voss's penetration into Germany accomplished, even in fiction.

Other incredible aspects of this film include Voss running through the deserted streets of Berlin at night in a full length formal evening gown,pursued by the S.S. and somehow escaping their detection. I live in a small town in the American Midwest and I couldn't escape detection from the police, let alone and elite military unit, if I was fleeing in blue jeans in the streets. Also at the very end of the movie it falls upon Leland to get himself, who can't speak German, without proper papers, and an unconscious Voss across the Swiss border at a regular German-patrolled border crossing. Another example of stuff depicted in this movie that happens all the time.",1472601600,,1768,4.7216828478964405

Melanie Griffin was very good  as the young American - Jewish girl  who wants to help her cousins,  who are hiding from the Nazis, and get them out of Berlin.  She decides to become a spy.  Michael Douglas is the spy master, who is unaware of her real intentions, and allows her to become part of  a mission to get into Berlin to find the information that the Nazis are creating a bomb.  Liam Neeson is the German general who has this information and she becomes a nanny for his children and is able to have access to these papers.  A good spy thriller.

463498,5,630243078X,"I have never written a film review on Amazon before, or anywhere else that I can recall, for that matter. But I fell in love with this film so much that I feel compelled to write something.

It is really sad to see how poorly this film has been reviewed and rated by some36% on Rotten Tomato, along with apparent actual winnings of several worst movie"" awards.

I stumbled onto this film on Netflix and saw it only because it is free and has Michael Douglas in it--I figured any film featuring him can't be THAT bad. Well, less than 48 hours later, I probably have savored parts of this film more times than I feel comfortable revealing.

One version of its trailers says ""they used to make movies this memorable; they used to make movies this powerful; they used to make movies this romantic.... and they still do."" I don't think this is an overstatement whatsoever. ""Shining Through,"" in my mind, is one of the most under-rated and overlooked film ever.

As someone who likes intelligent dialogues and female leads who have more to offer than a pretty face, I thought this movie has some incredibly well written--and well delivered--lines. I honestly am not sure what are some reviewers' problems with Melanie Griffith. I had never seen her films before, so I was not any biased fan, but I thought her performance in this flim is very memorable and inspiring. She delivered her lines just right and her character is a rare find of a women who exemplifies intelligence, wit, grace, and guts to stand up for herself and speak her mind--and doing so with such delightful playfulness at times and authentic vulnerability at others.

Stumbling into this movie this weekend felt like serendipitously coming across a piece of buried gem. This movie hijacked my emotions and thoughts all weekend but it was well worth it.

This film really touched my heart and soul. And after all those negative reviews and ratings, I hope the crew and cast are aware how much many viewers like myself absolutely appreciate their work and love this film!",1448150400,3,2032,4.709859154929577

463693,5,630243078X,"I watched this last night which was the first since it originally came out in the theaters. I haven't changed my mind in the least. Yes, this is a great WWII story but it is also a great romance with Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith at the top of their acting powers. Well, he is still pounding out the great roles but he is no longer the great romantic lead since he is now 70. But he was certainly a tremendous romantic lead in this film. Griffith matches him though scene for scene.

I also read the book upon which this was based, written by Susan Isaacs, which also was excellent.

The gist of the story is that the Melanie character comes to work for the Douglas character in WWII because he is inept at languages although he is a Harvard grad who is deep into WWII spying for the USA. She grew up in an American German speaking household so speaks it like a native. Plus she basically is a better spy than anyone else in their office. She is far more intuitive than the rest of them. She is also half Jewish which makes sending her into Germany all the more dangerous.

There are other solid performances throughout as well. We have early Liam Niassan here as a German officer who is a bit softer than your average Nazi, for what that is worth! Then there is Joely Richardson who plays a German woman who is a double agent. She is superb. She convinced me she was German and at the end of the movie I finally recognized her as the UK actor she is (Vanessa Redgrave's daughter). But this film is Douglas's and Griffith's all the way and if you are in the mood for a grand romance, look no further.",1441584000,2,1607,4.279605263157895

Yes, there are a few gaps in plausibility here and there, but still, kudos to David Seltzer for turning a hopelessly treacly novel into a better-than-average movie.

464144,1,630243078X,"It was actually physically painful to watch Melanie Griffith in this movie. The role would have been more credible had it been portrayed by any of a dozen other actresses. I only made it half way through this film, before I had to give up. (I am not into physical pain). Maybe she gets better later on in the film, I don't know. There seemed to be an inverse relationship between her job as an actress and the amount of pain I was experiencing. The longer I watched, and the more involved the story became, the greater my pain he came.",1433548800,,535,4.306930693069307
464145,4,630243078X,"It's an extremely entertaining film. But there are some warnings. If you are a fan of the ww2 spy genre this movie may disappoint. This movie falls into its own genre. It has nothing in common with the action oriented spy thriller. It really never makes it on a moral ,ethical statement of why war is bad. .So what makes this a film worth watching. Its the absurdity of how an American secretary who speaks german is sent into wartime Berlin to find the v1 rocket factory. And what qualifies this women for this extremely hazardous duty. She can size up any situation by recalling a movie she has seen where something similar has occurred. A truly amazing gift . Sounds like Play it Again Sam by Woody Allen. But this is not a comedy. Its played for true drama. This secretary(Melanie  Griffith) is so convincing that her spy boss (Michael Douglas) has to take her seriously about doing something for her country. She appears to be very clever as she can resolve a situation by recalling a similar situation from a film she has seen. Her qualifications. She does speak german. She is truly motivated as she is half jewish with family still in Germany.  All the elements are there except she has no training and no experience that qualifies her for even a sniff at being considered for one of the most important missions of ww2. However,she conviences all around her of her untested skills based on how she can size up any potentially dangerous situation using her movie memories. These are the best scenes in the film. .How she does this is very entertaining. We are actually convienced that she is perfect for this romp. Nothing in this film is even remotely believable about the true ww2 horrors. They make no real attempt at showing the reality of war.
THE PLOT AS SEEN BY HER SPY BOSS :"" Okay, we will get you into Berlin ,meet Sir John G. (a double agent) and he will get you a job with a high ranking gestapo officer. From there you will find the plans and meet me at the Berlin train station in two weeks with the micro film."" BRITAIN IS SAVED FROM THE FUTURE BLITZ. Tough to believe that is what the audience is being sold. But we are.
Why it works. Melanie Griffith gives the performance  of her career. She is good. Really. There are some heavy hitters in this film. Liam N. Sir John G.,Michael Douglas and Joely Richardson. She is in almost every seen with one of the above and carries them. Truly. She really has you convienced that she will pull this off . The suspense occurs as there are backfires to each part of the plan. How will she get out of this one? She does though. Remember she has seen lots of movies. Is there true nail bitings suspense.  Of course not. But her character is so likeable you actually find yourself rooting for her.

The end is so improbable (no spoilers) that you think you are watching a film played for comedy.
For a true lover of spy, ww2 , or action genres you do not get anything you haven't seen before . Those films are done better with more suspense. True drama . But you do get to see Mellanie Griffith carry an entire film with a very entertaining character. It is worth the time and money for this alone. If this is not enough then stick to the classic films of the spy master writers. It is nice to see something presented in a different way. Albeit, improbable.
2 Stars for an interesting premise.""Walter Mitty vs. nazi Germany"". And a big 2 stars for Ms. Griffith's performance. Played for drama not comedy. This film premise is so unlikely that it actually works.",1433462400,3,3521,4.469673405909798

464219,5,630243078X,"Douglas seems a bit less believable than Griffith, but the story is well told, suspenseful, and charming, though about a period of history that is difficult for a civilized person to fathom.  Melanie is lovely as the young, brilliant, movie-going half-Jewish applicant for a secretarial position in a law firm. She charms the boss (Douglas) and discovers his secret life as a spy. Her inveigling to accompany him, after a lengthy time apart, to rescue and transport her Jewish family members, results in a tense drama with heart. A young Liam Neeson makes an appearance as a Nazi officer under scrutiny, who ultimately hires Griffith as his children's nanny.  Sir John Gielgud is also a spy.

Melanie Griffith is superb as a foreign spy in Germany.  Michael Douglas has always been a superior actor in every role I have seen him portray.  Together they are just wonderful.  This is a wonderful example of being 'tried in fire' and how two people can overcome when their priorities are in the right place.  There is some shooting so remember this is a war movie.

Then try to imagine the incompetent German Gestapo being unable to catch a woman in an white evening gown running through the streets of Berlin in high heels at midnight. I can't either.

466477,2,630243078X,Melanie Griffith's fifteen-year-old voice doesn't work in this type of movie.  The tired script is a cliche of the 1950s spy-movie genre.

466479,2,630243078X,"Quick story recap: Jewish/German Woman finds herself working as secretary for a spy, she proves herself to her boss, gets sent to WWII Germany for spying work, Spying ensues.  I will start by saying as far as entertainment value, you can be entertained by this movie but not worth money to buy. The movie does deliver on a few moments of suspense and action but that's about the most praise I'll give it as a film.

The acting of Melanie Griffith in her breathy and labored delivery especially from the beginning to the middle, was so painful to listen to that it distracts from the film.  She gets slightly better as the movie continues but she is in no way believable in her role.  I think Micheal Douglas and Liam Niesan did a fair job with what they were handed which didn't amount to much for either of them to do.

I wanted to like this movie because spying, WW II, and women  do make for an intriguing subject matter.  However, there is no redemption for the stupid things included in this movie.  It would be tons better if the narration and television interview scenes could be cut completely. But there are far too many plot problems to save it either (Entire German army can't find a woman in an evening gown running around the city, Liam Niesan's character suspicious of Melanie Griffith but still allows her free rein in his house and with his children, Melanie Griffith sent to WW II Germany as a spy with only training on using a microfilm camera, a secret room has the key above the door, the list goes on)  If you are reading this don't get sucked in by overblown ratings, this one isn't worth three stars.",1422057600,2,1623,4.47457627118644

466557,2,630243078X,"Not a bad story but casting Melanie Griffiths as the heroine was a casting mistake. I know she was popular in the 80's, but her breathy voice was a distraction.

466558,2,630243078X,"This film was nicely staged, probably with a hefty budget, but in terms of wartime intrigue, it falls as flat as a Pfannkuchen. Melanie Griffith is inept in her role as a would-be spy in Nazi Germany. With her character's stupidity and embarrassingly unconvincing command of the German language, she would not have lasted a half-hour before being discovered by the Gestapo and sent back in a boxcar to Hollywood. Michael Douglas's performance was good during the first part of the film, but his ""heroic"" rescue of Linda Voss was implausible in the extreme, almost laughably so. It was a miscalculation to have Linda narrate the story in a long series of flashbacks, as we in the audience were consigned to feel no threat whatsoever to her survival. And why do the native Germans speak in (subtitled) German for much of the film but then revert to English in other parts? That strains our suspension of disbelief. Worst of all, a spy thriller should never be a boring as ""Shining Through."" I had trouble staying awake, which surely is not a good sign.",1420588800,2,1050,4.743169398907104

466736,1,630243078X,"I went against my better judgement and bought a movie with Melanie Griffith as the star.  I have only myself to blame, but in my defense I so hoped that having Michael Douglas and Liam Neeson would keep it out of the dung heap that is Griffith's filmography.  Mea culpa.  This movie is so improbable, so implausible, so horribly acted by Griffith, has such terrible dialogue, so little chemistry between the two leads, and such an outrageously ridiculous storyline that it fully deserves every bit of negativity leveled at it.

Please do yourself a favor and read the one-star reviews before buying this or even renting it.  If you like Melanie Griffith, or if you really, really love romance stories, go ahead.  Just don't expect good story-telling or even adequate story-telling.

The costumes, sets, and score are well done, but my overall impression of this movie will always be that of Melanie Griffith, who's just been found out as a spy and now has nazis looking for her, running through the darkened streets for some distance in a long white evening gown, and no-one notices.

With a different lead (a good actress, instead of a Name) and a better screenplay and script, this could have been a very good movie.",1417824000,4,1218,4.766666666666667

A movie loving Jewish/Irish girl living in America winds up working for the Government in a rather cloak and dagger way. Determined to do her part and save her Jewish kin, she throws herself into Germany as an undercover Cook, which she fails miserably at, but then lucks out with a Governess position.

I thought this was a well made film, and I love that it features women in primary roles not just as the hapless girlfriend of the guys who get to be heroes. WWII has a significant number of real life women, military and civilians, who did heroic things which helped to win the war and it's great to see a fictional film that references some of those things such as working for the OSS.

Michael Douglas, Melanie Griffith, Liam Neeson, Sir John Gielgud give this story by Susan Isaacs a movie to own and enjoy over and over.

But it's a wonderful story!  And probably not a terribly far-off interpretation of what life in Berlin was like during that awful, awful time in our history.  I loved the movie when I saw it as a teenager (okay, maybe more of a ""young adult""), have since read the book, and still love it to this day!

Griffith is luminous in what I firmly believe is her best role, and Douglas perfect as an old school, taciturn, military hard ass, and the suspense is thrilling. Among its achievements the film manages to create a sense of what life  was like in a German city towards the latter stages of WW2. Neeson, and Guilgud are excellent.

467370,1,630243078X,"Someone I love and respect very much and whom I find highly intelligent and well-versed asked to me to watch her favorite movie. She knows I love movies and write reviews and wants to hear my opinion about this supposedly exciting, suspenseful, romantic movie.

I hoped for the best but was ready to possibly be disappointed just in case. I wasn't ready for this level of disappointment. I could barely get through the first half of it. It is so poorly written, acted, and directed: The bad movie hat trick.

It's supposed to be a drama but it is utterly unbelievable to the point of laughter. It's like it was written by a teenage girl with ADD. It has a cliche-ridden and unnecessary narration read by Griffith - who has the voice of an 8-year-old. She falls in love with Douglas for NO OTHER reason except that he's the male lead. He says nothing positive to her for 99% of the movie. He doesn't say much at all, in fact. He never shows any emotion at all except frustration and discomfort. He gets frustrated with her job interview, hires her as his secretary anyway, gets frustrated when she sniffs him out as a spy, then they are suddenly having sex, with no intervening relationship development apart from a discussion of Charlie Chaplin - but the narration says they are lovers, so they must be!

And (Mary Sue Alert) suddenly the heroine is solving all the intel problems of the war because she learned about spying from watching a lot of Hollywood movies. And since she speaks German and makes great strudel, she is sent to Germany as a spy - never mind that she sounds like an 8-year-old from New York.

I am trying to find SOMETHING positive to say about this movie. Griffith's character has a few great lines in the first act that establish her as a smart, strong woman. One wishes the rest of the script were as quick-witted. It's also set during the 1940s and the costumes and hair are extremely authentic. And Michael Kamen's score is nice, if not one of his best.

It is the story of how a secretary ends up volunteering to go undercover in Berlin in the early days of WWII in order to try to get some important documents. After a number of adventures, she ends up being rescued by her handler with whom she is in love. In addition to the espionage aspect, the heroine is also part Jewish which adds another dimension to the movie as she has some relatives in hiding in Berlin. The story is interesting enough to be entertaining. The only part I am somewhat dubious about is the casting for the lead role. Melanie Griffith doesn't seem that convincing. Her German accent is horrific and she would never have actually passed for a real German. She also seems a little flimsy for this type of role.

Hey, it's not an historical documentary, it's entertainment!

She got on my nerves with her voice. Michael Douglas doesn't do much more than look stoic throughout here. Liam Neeson has a nice early turn as a Nazi who takes in Griffith as a maid, only she is a spy. If you can believe that she is a German Jew, then I guess you can believe anything. This is very slow off the ground, and doesn't pick up any suspense at all until more than half-way in when we finally get into Nazi Germany and the only question is will the good guys beat the bad guys?

468063,4,630243078X,"""Shining Through"" shines with its stars, Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith, as well as beautiful location, fantastic cinematography, direction and script. The opening scene shows a older Linda Voss (Melanie Griffith) giving a WWII Spy story to the BBC.  The film pans back to a young Linda growing up in New York with a German Jewish father (who teaches her the language) and an Irish mother.  Linda uses her smarts to get a job as secretary in 1940 New York City.  She is savvy and soon suspects her boss (Michael Douglas) is a spy.  When America enters WWII, his key contact and operative in Berlin is killed.  Linda has Jewish relatives in Germany she wants to help, and also feels the need to be part of finding information on the German bomb research site.  It is a new technology that puts bombs on rockets, and the USA wants it destroyed before it is put into operation.  Linda convinces her boss she can help fill the position, although he is very worried the Germans will find out about her Jewish background.  She begs him to let her go undercover and become a secret agent. This was the one part where I smiled - Linda bakes a strudel to show her boss the German's will love her cooking and accept her as a fantastic cook. She comes to Michael Douglas and begs him to believe in her as well as her German cooking.  However klutzy, the scene worked. He eventually lets her go over to Germany as a secret agent.  It is a very interesting time and the movie captures the Germany in a surreal time.  Throughout the movie, there are many twists and turns as Linda uses her smarts to learn about her relatives and get the information on the rocket bomb development site.

Linda's tale of her adventure in Nazi Germany is just good story-telling and overall fun, well worth the watch - if you like good old-fashioned spy thrillers.",1292716800,,1838,4.536363636363636

468065,5,630243078X,"This is one of my favorite WW II romance dramas...even better than ""Notorious"". Also I cannot really see any similarities between the two movies, but obviously the movie critics see a certain resemblance.
Melanie Griffith was perfect in her role as Lina Voss (but she was even better in ""Working Girl""), so was Michael Douglas, Liam Neeson and Joely Richardson.
This is one example where the movie is a lot better than the book (by Susan Isaacs). The first 300 pages in Isaac's novel are not very interesting. What we enjoy in the movie are the last 100 pages from the novel, so this movie director did a very smart thing and eliminated the first 300 un-filmable pages.
I can watch this film over and over again which I don't do with too many other WW II movies.

468240,5,630243078X,"I was on the edge of my seat during this movie.  There were so many different turns, between the romance and the WWII espionage aspect of the movie.  Subtle humor and wonderful performances.

Melanie Griffith plays Linda, a young woman born to immigrants: a Jewish, German father and an Irish mother.  She has been raised to speak both German and English. Her ability to speak German with fluency allows her to become a secretary for Ed Leland (Michael Douglas), a spy. Her sharp eye for details frustrates Ed to no end as she points out that she would make a better spy than he does.  Stubborn to a fault, she convinces Ed to allow her into Germany so that she can spy on high-ranking Nazi officials ... undercover as a German domestic.  Through a series of turns, she is fired from one job but is quickly re-hired by another Nazi officer (Liam Neeson), who trusts her as a nanny to watch his children.  Linda struggles to maintain her cover and to try to save her cousins -- Jews who are struggling to hide in Berlin.  Linda is tutored in espionage by the legendary agent Sunflower (John Gielgud), a German spying for the Americans.

Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith have great chemistry in this movie.  Melanie Griffith speaks German with such a convincing accent she is to be commended.  Liam Neeson and John Gielgud add to the film nicely.  All in all, a good WWII/spy movie with the right amount of romance and adventure.",1237766400,,1431,4.612648221343873

And then, when she drops the microfilm right in front of a Gestopo agent, she simply covers it with her foot until he loses interest and goes away! By this time tears were running down my cheek!

  And then there's unilingual Michael Douglas racing to her rescue, traveling through Nazi Germany with a bandaid around his neck and a sign that reads, ""Wounded soldier, can't speak"". I guess that if they asked him to write something in German he could have just cramped up and shrugged. But fear not, he emegres in the end, none the worse for wear, even after being shot in the back, repeatedly, at point blank range with a German Mauser.

Linda's hopeless life. Her alcoholic mother, John Berringer esquire and her ridculous hope that their shotgun wedding can result in true happiness. John's cold ruthless sexuality. Linda's belief that she is SMARTER than they are!  Nan Leland (John's wife then John's ex and her incredible socialite spite).

  The movie? Who cared? Who could believe that the OSS would use a German speaker in Germany who was not a native of that country. I could rewrite the novel and the movie and make it much better. Leland could not possibly be running around the world as a ""spy"" He was never a spy. He worked for army intelligence, got to law school and became a beaurocrat.
His job was management and coordination and reporting to congress.
  Laughable moments. Linda goes to work for Ed.  without any dialogue, character development or anything not even a little kissy face, we suddenly see Melanie in black garters on top of him in a brief 'love scene."" Michael Douglas does not touch Melanie one time in this scene. Get it?
  Melanie engineers for herself an exact copy of the famous ""goodbye"" scene between Rick and Ilsa in ""Casablanca' The prop engine plane the night, the fog and the hat are so stupid I had to turn it off to recover.

  Ed naturally rescues the stupid spy who gets caught. He goes to Berlin although he does not speak German apparantly at all or he wouldn't have needed a translator in the first place. ""The Spy wore Red"" supposedly a true story of Aline countess of Ramonones (A spanish contessa) and American model who worked in Europe all her life and who never got caught would have made a much better story. Susan Isaacs can't write a decent plot to save her life.  She's wonderful with characters though.

468423,5,630243078X,"This is one of my favorite DVDs.  It's set between the USA and Nazi-Germany about 1945.  Melanie Griffin and Michael Douglas are the primary actors, of course, with great supporting actors/actresses.  Melanie is half Jewish, living in Queens, in search of a job. While looking for a secretary job, she gets the not-good-enough treatment because she's not from Vassar. Things change quickly, when they hear her speaking German to a cleaning lady.  Just so happens that the head honcho (Michael) needs an interpreter secretary cause he can't speak German. Turns out old Michael is a secret spy for the USA and makes trips back and forth to Germany and needs letters translated and such.

When one of the other spies gets whacked by the Nazis, Melanie decides she wants to go into the spy thing for the US, so she can check out her Jewish relatives, last seen in Berlin, and maybe get them to safety in the US, somehow.  She manages to even mix in with the German elite.  Liam Neeson is also great as a high-ranking German officer.  And John Gielgud is a spy too.  As always, he is outstanding in everything.

There are great plots, characters, twists and turns, and lots of suspense.  It's a spy thing, run-and-hide from the Nazi's (who are snoopy little suckers), get the secrets, and get out alive type movie.  It's also a love story, cause Melanie falls in love with old Michael along the way and he acts like the coldest mackarel in town.

468480,5,630243078X,"To be honest I am surprised that I have not managed to see this movie before now, considering my weakness for espionage movies and specifically World War II spy pictures (I list WHERE EAGLES DARE and THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS among my favorite 100 movies).

I did see parts of this movie before, as it played in the background of a house party I attended over a decade before. But it was perhaps the presence of Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith as the leads that led me to think that it was just some lame action adventure that Hollywood sometimes has a tendency to unload on us.

Boy was I wrong!

My TiVo picked up the show as a suggestion when it played on HBO and as I sat down to watch it I realized that this movie was more drama than action and more suspense than adventure. A true revelation and factors that really heightened the quality and provided compulsive viewing for the next two hours-plus.

The story centers around a bilingual (English and German) secretary Linda Voss that begins to work for a rather shadowy businessman Ed Leland (played by Douglas) at the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Soon she suspects he is a spy and after taking down a particularly strange message she confronts her boss with her suspicions.

Fast forward and upon America's entrance into the conflict Ed reveals himself to be an operative for OSS (the precursor to today's CIA) and an Army officer to-boot.

With her knowledge of German and highly keen observation skills Linda is soon attending top secret OSS meetings and (against Ed's better judgement) sent into Germany to steal secret plans for the V-1 and V-2 rockets.

What follows is a thoroughly entertaining story that shows a truly frightening and at points terrifying depiction of life in Nazi Germany that includes some top calibre acting talent in the lead roles. In addition to Douglas and Griffith we also have Liam Neeson as a German officer, Jeoly Richardson as a German civilian and John Gielgud as an old spymaster. All give tour-de-force performances and although sometimes the plot can be somewhat predictable (we suspect early on the true allegiances of one of the three supporting characters may not be what they seem to be) but it is always compelling and wonderful entertainment.

The DVD is available in widescreen (always a plus) and although its rather light on special features it is available for under $10.

But I would ignore the negative criticisms of the film and seek out this underrated gem, finally out on DVD.

It looks stunning, and I credit Fox for giving us an excellent transfer.  The widescreen looks fabulous and for $10, this is no cheap pan-and-scan write-off.

In proving an interpretor as being a possible double-spy she becomes privy to some of the inner goings on of Ed's office.

She does finally cause him to smile and they do fall for each other and become lovers.  Their relationship suffers a seperation after Pearl Harbor and Ed disappears for several months.

During the War she is relagated to the secretarial pool in the basement where she is always searching some word of Ed.  He never contacts her.

She spends some time at the USO and in walks Ed Leland with a brunette on his arm.  He doesn't see Linda until he starts dancing and then all hell breaks out emotionally.  She begs him to tell her how to quit loving him.

Watch it to find out how she convinces the powers that be to send her to Germany as a spy.  Boy does she goof up.

There she meets up with Sunshine, Margrete Von Eberstein and Horst Drescher.

Drescher sets Linda up [in hiring her to cook]to meet Franz-Otto Dietrich and his two children.  Linda then disappears from all aquaintances [and scares the crap out of Ed] as she takes over the job of nanny to the high ranked German.

Even Margrete does not know where she is.  Linda pursues her quest for her cousins.  And tells Margrete and Ed [when he shows up undercover]that she has located her cousins.

During a bombing raid she has Dietrich's children with her as she locates the address of her cousins [only to find them gone] and learns of a hidden room in Dietrich's basement.

She has film and Ed is waiting to help her make an escape from war torn Germany.  You have to see her flight and Ed's daring rescue of her and the other twists and actions to fully enjoy this love story.

Do not pass it up - see for yourself just how good it really is.

468485,5,630243078X,"This has always been one of my favorite films. Apparently it's supposed to be a guilty pleasure. I can't imagine why though. It's not a deep or socially important work of art, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's just a glorious, old-fashioned piece of entertainment, gorgeously shot on location in Germany, with one of the best scores the late Michael Kamen ever wrote.

Alright, so Melanie Griffith convinces Michael Douglas to send her as a spy into Nazi Germany because of her phenomenal streudel baking skills. It's that kind of movie. Either you let yourself be swept away by the storytelling, or it's just not for you.

The big news, however, is that this great movie is finally on DVD in the US. And it's in widescreen, a vital piece of information that was left off the listing here. I was really afraid I'd walk into Tower today and see a Pan and Scan atrocity and have to leave it there unbought. Worry not, the film is presented here as it was in theaters in 1992.

The makers of this DVD have also kindly left the original burned-in subtitles for the sequences in German, instead of replacing them with those ugly player generated ones you see so often. I always liked the font the filmmakers chose, so this was a pleasant surprise.

It would have been nice to have a director's commentary, or some of the approximately half an hour that was removed from the version that was shot. However for under $10 what we get (two trailers) is fine.

It took long enough, with the US just about the last country on earth to get ""Shining Through"" on DVD, but it's here at last, and looking as good as I could have possibly have hoped.",1105401600,103,1634,4.488215488215488
468486,5,630243078X,"I am so pleased this title is finally getting a DVD release - and at only $10!  Shining Through is based on the novel by Susan Issacs and is a melodrama at it's core - but a damn fine one.  Lost among the hoopla over the ""other"" Michael Douglas film that year (""Basic Instinct"") Shining Through never got the cred it deserved as a film made in the classic Hollywood style.

The plot is relatively simple, for a film about espoinage : Melanie Griffith, a Jewish secretary, is hired by Michael Douglas for normal secretarial work, and eventually learns that her boss moonlights as a ranking member of the US military.  Through a series of cleverly timed events, she is drawn into the world of intelligence and becomes a Nazi Germany spy herself.

All of the actors were at their prime when making this film - Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson join the picture part way through and do an excellent job, as do the leads.  Although at it's core it's really a love story, there is enough action and tension to entertain anyone who can suspend the disbelief that Melanie Griffith could become an international spy.

If I make it sound like ""Alias"", it's not - it's just a wonderfully crafted film that is a worthy addition to any collection, especially anyone who is a fan of classic Hollywood melodramas.  Shining Through has never gotten it's due credit - I hope that a wider audience finds it on this excellently priced DVD!",1105142400,3,1421,4.58893280632411

468560,1,630243078X,"This film is a complete waste of celluloid.  The target audience is, apparently, frustrated female secretaries who wish that romance and adventure would drop into their laps.  Sadly, however, the film fails utterly in believability, unless you're an 8-year-old insomniac on prozac.

The acting is painful.  Mike Douglas has done better, but given the childlike simplicity of the dialogue, plot, good-guys-vs-bad-guys theme, empty romance based on nothing more than a weak adrenalin rush... well, you can see where I'm going with this.

You'll get more bang and excitement out of a wet, spent firecracker than you will from this film-- unless you put it on a hearth and toast marshmallows over its charred remains.  Don't forget to throw champagne glasses into the fireplace, for that extra touch of romance and a touch of shards-of-glass-as-critical-film-review.

In the words of some professional film critics:

If the fate of the free world were being threatened by goose-stepping Nazis, who would you send to the rescue? In Shining Through they send Melanie Griffith. What, you mean Betty Boop wasn't available?  ""Hal Hinson

[Melanie Griffith] sounds like a 7-year-old reciting poetry for the delight of grown-ups. Its enough to make you want to turn her in to the Nazis.  ""Desson Howe

468561,5,630243078X,"I saw some of the other (negative) reviews on this movie, and I think they're missing the point. I wasn't very interested in the individual acting performances, as much as I was in the story itself. I haven't been able to find many movies that were done in the WWII setting as this one was, so that was a unique, refreshing perspective in and of itself.
The ""Romance"" element is essential to any war story, so putting it up front in the movie set the tone for everything else, to me. Even the conflict caused by Liam Neeson's character, which showed some humanity within the borders of 1940's Germany, was a nice change from the expected ruthlessness that's typical in these settings.
I'm obviously not a professional critic. Not even close. I'm a typical guy that likes good movies and good stories. I didn't even know that this movie was based on a novel. I don't wanna know. All I know is that the movie works for me.",1042502400,6,920,4.482142857142857

Can the same close-knit group of spies be on different sides without any one of them noticing or having it cause any of them problems except the heroine?  How can they expect people not to notice this?  (By putting a shoot-em-up romantic happy ending so that no one thinks at all about what has just happened.)

Linda (Melanie Griffith) is employed by german general of high standing without any Gestapo examination. Obviously, it was impossible in real life.
General says about ""secret room"". Even his children know about it, but Linda doesn't. Is it really a ""secret""?
Furthermore, key can be easily found at this ""secret"" door. And this room keeps documents about new secret German weapon. Actually, during that war many american, british, russian agents died, trying to get such documents.
But Linda, who arrived to Germany only a few days ago, got that secrets only in a 5 minutes! Only stupid can believe it!
Film contains also many other incredible, unbelievable, false scenes. Only stupids or people who have never heard about 2nd World War can believe it.
During 2nd World War died about 50 000 000 people!

Works on all levels: action , drama, romance, intrigue, war and even suspense. Griffith is good as the heroine spy who penetrates deep behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany 1942. This film is also superbly shot showing the beauty of Berlin before it was bombed. Neeson makes a good film appearance too, and is well cast, he goes on to be a Jewish sympathiser in Spielberg's Schindler's List. Douglas is once again top class, and the final scene where he is carrying Griffith is truly spectacular. This film as it should be isn't a tragedy but one of hope. Offers a look deep inside Nazi Germany in the early 1940s (and also the effects of air raids on morale). Of mention is the Nazi parade which was superbly shot, likewise the train journey from Berlin to Switzerland. There are also a few good plot twists to please suspense viewers, but this multi-genre movie will certainly please all.

Both lovers get more than they bargained for when Linda ends up in the home of a high-ranking German official and risks her life trying to discover the location of her Jewish relatives hiding in Berlin.

This is about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and how they react to those circumstances -  and to each other. Melanie Griffith does a credible job as Linda Voss,  although it is obvious she had to take a crash course in German before the  filming started.  (The actor who played Ed Leland's assistant had a much  more authentic accent, and obviously knows German.)  Michael Douglas's  performance was a little stiff, but his persona works well with Griffith's,  and together they make the storyline work.  All the other lead actors gave  what I thought were authentic and well-done performances. The set designs  were excellent - especially Ed's apartment in New York and Margerete's  apartment in Berlin.  They were SO 1930's!  Kudos to the set designers who  did their research well. The storyline is a little slow in places, but the  viewer hangs on because you don't know what is going to happen next.  The  plot could have gone in several different directions, so the viewer stays  with the story to find out.  And, although this film is based on Susan  Isaacs' novel, I think it is safe to say that something along this line  probably happened during World War II.  As I said earlier, it was about  ordinary people in very extraordinary circumstances.
