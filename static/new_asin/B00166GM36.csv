8261091,5,B00166GM36,"I have enjoyed this DVD tremendously. The menu starts with the Ankara-born pianist playing his best seller tune Black Earth. The setting is a large room overlooking the Bosphorous strait in Istambul. Put your high fidelity headphones on, and the cameraman takes you up close to Fazil, a marvelous steinway, and Istambul. I watched many Fazil Say YouTube videos on the web, but this High resolution DVD is different. Through many interviews and the music he plays, you are left with a desire to know the man even more. Through his interpretation, Bach's genius is rediscovered, Mozart's joyfulness explodes in the Jazzy Alla Turca, the Appasionnata (played on a Bosendorfer) opens us to Beethoven's heart as it rubs peace through unabashed fury. Fazil Say's own compositions (Nazim Hikmet) interpreted by choir and orchestra is sheer delight. The DVD comes with two bonuses: The jazzed up and popular Paganini variations and Silk Road (Fazil Say composition). No regret buying the DVD. It's a keep!",1402531200,,997,5.122699386503068
