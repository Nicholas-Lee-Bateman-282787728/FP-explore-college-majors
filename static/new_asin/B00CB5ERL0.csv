5710906,3,B00CB5ERL0,"Guido had a natural instinct to kill and not being killed.  He was a warrior.  Nothing special with flare to martial arts, just a plain John Doe whose head was messed up with stored ANGER from his experiences of WAR which killed his family.

5710917,4,B00CB5ERL0,"Every so often you run into a B movie that hits the spot. This is one of these. The acting is so so, the plot, lets just say aside from the unique and quirky touches is pretty mundane but it all mixes into something interesting and quirky.

Without spoiling the plot it's the typical anti-hero who finds redemption and goes on to do good things, though Guido seemed to be doing good things all along.... just really violently.

5710945,4,B00CB5ERL0,"Guido works for a boss who has rules of no drugs or prostitutes which is the kick-off for the plot when they get tangled up with Armenians who traffic in girls and everybody is trying to get a bigger piece of the pie.  The real story is the relationship that develops between Guido and his landlady as they travel cross country.
Reasonably good acting from most of the actors and some fun bits. I agree that there are a few fight scenes that should of been reshot, due to them appearing no more lethal than a WWW fight.

If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and give it a watch. You've got nothing to lose.

(please don't talk about  losing hours of your life watching movies, you know you've done much less with more time)",1413676800,2,721,4.318518518518519

5710947,4,B00CB5ERL0,Nice surprise better than I expected,1412121600,,36,5.166666666666667
5710948,4,B00CB5ERL0,"Some days, the knight in rusty armor's a CIA and Mossad trained Iraqi Kurdish assassin in exile called Guido, whose quest is saving the defenseless. And making me laugh while he's so damned bizzy in absolutely believable hand-to-hand fights with bricks, guns, knives, hymnals, sacred candlelabra, and pantyhose.

Let me say up front, after getting cheap takeout sushi, I wasn't expecting much from GUIDO, considering the actors I knew in this film, who are no longer, well, leading men, but after aging out of their prime roles a decade or two ago, are now rarely seen character actors perhaps known best for certain over-the-top performances. But...in black comedies, over the top, that's mostly OK. Which is why someone else mentioned it's campy. Maybe it was all the director's craft this time around. Somehow, it worked, and I was laughing at Guido, with Guido, and in the face of certain nasty Death. But believing every scene.

So like the first hit of Wasabi, I was surprised. Now I'm thinking GUIDO's my new favorite cult gangster film. Even though it's a black comedy, it is based on an all-too-true crime scenario that recently grabbed world headlines, with a 91-person bust in L.A. just the week before I watched this film!  Plenty dead bodies, and it sure looked like they all deserved it.

While another review points out how low-budget GUIDO is no flashy BOURNE LEGACY, I say the acting is high up there on the believability scale. Particularly Guido and The Mexican-American Florist Lady, and top cop Armand Assante. Villain Billy Zane is always ironic, so his bits with campy knuckle knocks and maybe an eyerolling instance or two seemed typical quirks of his character's minor gangsterness.

So if you're on the fence about renting this film, I'd say jump in when you're up for something light. Wrapped up in this tight and darkly funny gangster film, there's another solid indicator of better-than-average crime flicks in general on board: every single one of the 30+ fights Guido is in is refreshingly realistic.  No obvious cutaways or tricks marred Guido's fight scenes, though I did see a fight scene Guido was not in that had a sloppy fake punch or two. But if you, like me, do find yourself looking for some *Even though I personally am not Jason Statham, maybe I could learn to do some of that chopsocky, just in case* moments,  Guido's fighting seems to be right out of the CIA-Mossad  close combat manual. It looks like a disciplined non-super-hero guy using some Mossad martial arts to beat down less disciplined but determined pros.

Couldn't find this film in Wikipedia, and had to blow up the credits and then check IMDB to figure out who played Guido. Ready to be as shocked as I was? Turns out, the excellent fighter, and brilliantly understated black-comedy actor is...A FREAKING CYPRIOT-GREEK MEDIA MOGUL, LIKE A BILLIONAIRE TV BROADCASTER. Alki David??? On my screen it was distorted and looked like *Alkx Dayoi*. Had to lookup this ""promising new star"". I thought I might be watching the next Jean Reno. Turns out this guy's a very experienced producer, director, financier, and actor, and has actually been in a Jason Statham film!!!

Real life aside, something about this character, like legendary Jean Reno in THE PROFESSIONAL, has the down and outcast, balls to the wall, unstoppable dedicated get-it-done guy from the slums essence that is hard to look away from. How does this happen? How does  a billionaire media mogul do this impoverished Arab lonester killer so believably? Maybe he helped finance the movie...maybe he paid someone to write his role and juice it up...Whatever, it's still a surprise tour-de-force that made me shout GET HIM, GUIDO so loud the  UPS delivery guy who brought my file cabinet up the stairs said *Wow, what are you watching?*",1411948800,7,3801,4.912636505460219

It looks like the movie was probably a fun movie to make. It delivers: decent action; self-less tongue-in-cheek; and acting far superior to mine. Ok, I don't act but I do get easily distracted by bad acting and there were only few instances that I even paid attention to the acting; the rest of the time I sat back and watched a three star movie make my four star list.

In short: if you are looking for eyegasms put this on your 'watch later' list. If you want something where you can feel good about giving overlooking a few flaws in return for a fun story with soul watch Guido.",1400457600,3,724,4.3161764705882355
