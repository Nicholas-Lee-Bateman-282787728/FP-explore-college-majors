8397586,5,B003INBNZ2,"A low-budget independent movie with a talented cast and highly original premise that gives a whole meaning to the phase ""Grrrrl Power""! The true ""monster"" in this film is misguided ideology and what happens when it goes too far, giving it a timely (and timeless) relevance. If you're looking for a change of pace from the usual horror/thrillers coming out of Hollywood, give this Baltimore-originated production a stab!",1392249600,2,419,5.176470588235294
8397587,2,B003INBNZ2,"I thought this was tongue in cheek, and had the potential to be ""so bad it's good,"" but it was actually just bad.",1374364800,,113,3.9565217391304346
8397588,1,B003INBNZ2,"Yes, within 15 minutes I could tell you virtually verbatim how the movie would end. What surprised me was the incredibly poor quality of the acting.......not most of the characters but virtually ALL did absolutely DREADFUL jobs.
Gotta hand it to the producers....there hasn't been a '70s era ""feminazi"" movie made in 30 years until this......thing.
I would give anything to get my money back this movie was so dreadful. Thinking VERY seriously about joining Hulu Plus on top of Netflix and weaning myself off of Amazon.
And why no ""specials""? You can view some through the Amazon site using your Roku....but shouldnt Amazon have a separate category for say $.99 cent movies or $1.99 movies? The few rental stores that still exist do....why can't Amazon? Perhaps they do and its just hidden somewhere. If it is hidden I would appreciate it if Amazon would make it clear just where to find such categories of selections.
Back to the movie. I made a HUGE mistake in renting this movie......I regret the heck out of it. PLEASE take my advice and avoid this movie like the plague!",1335744000,2,1075,4.78494623655914
8397589,3,B003INBNZ2,"I was surprised that the plot was actually interesting.  Sometimes I felt the acting was mediocre, at worst...but some of that might have just been the fault of an implausible, choppy dialogue script.  Character development was very poor, in my opinion.  I would have liked to see a bit more depth in a movie taking such a serious stab at cultural issues.
I don't regret taking the time to watch it, so that is always a good indication that it had some merit.",1309910400,,459,4.506024096385542
8397590,5,B003INBNZ2,"I just got this movie and I was so excited that I had to watch it the night I got it.  Great movie......it's one of those thrillers that has some dark humor in it.  It also contains some interesting social commentary that actually adds to its appeal.  The acting is quite good (surprisingly good for an independent film).  The story line is easy to follow and has a great flow.  The fight scenes are even pretty good.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to my friends.

Favorite scene:
""A daughter is one of the goddess's greatest gifts.""
""And a son?""
""Sure""

When you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.  =o)",1284422400,2,620,4.464285714285714
8397591,5,B003INBNZ2,Unusual for a horror film.  It actually has an interesting story line.  Very good for an independent film.,1280707200,2,106,4.833333333333333

8397593,5,B003INBNZ2,"Lonnie Martin's Women's Studies has been on the festival and horror con circuit, and it's just brilliant. Truly a labor of love on the part of the Martins (and you can go check out their website and blog to learn all about the saga of making this film).  The movie itself is a tongue-in-cheek homage to slasher flicks with a dash of old school thriller thrown in, and made by someone who holds the horror genre close to his heart.",1271980800,4,430,4.375
