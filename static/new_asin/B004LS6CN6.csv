4404667,2,B004LS6CN6,"THE WORMS CRAWL IN THE WORMS CRAWL OUT
THAT'S WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT...
Too bad it's not all that frightening.  This addition to SyFy's prolific amount of giant creecher feechers offers nothing new and even durable Sean Patrick Flanery bombs.  The rest of the cast is downright awful.  Producer/actor Andrew Stevens pops up out of nowhere in a who is this guy role and gets sucked up by a killer worm!! WTF?
I've enjoyed a lot of these SyFy ""originals"" but this certainly isn't one of their shining moments.",1304121600,4,513,4.615384615384615
4404668,4,B004LS6CN6,"The title alone warns you this wasn't meant to be taken seriously.  Another tipoff, Sean Patrick Flanery's performance, delivered for laughs, even when he's being tortured.  This film is rampant with dopey bad guys, bumbling fools, and pompous pinheads.  Good sense wasn't involved (rule number 1, when you hear a rumbling under the ground, don't go and investigate.  Rule number 2, when hiding from the bad guys at night, don't start a camp fire...because nothing says `you can't see us' like a roaring fire!).  None of this should/could be confused with great art.  It wasn't supposed to be.  Take it as it is: a joke.  Even producer Andrew Stevens pops in...just in time to be eaten!  Yes, it's cheap and cheesy and obviously quickly made.  Yes it's bad.  But it's not terrible.  It's a hoot.  Take it that way and you won't be disappointed.
It's a keeper!",1303948800,22,859,4.761904761904762
4404669,1,B004LS6CN6,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It's low grade can be attributed to a marginal plot, and poor acting performances throughout.  Even the flesh eating grubs or so called death worms leave alot to be desired.  Don't waste your time on this one!",1303776000,7,260,4.375
4404670,5,B004LS6CN6,"Its the best creature movie yet and a treasure guarded by killer man-eating worms only a genious could think of a movie like this.

Nice level of gore like the one where blood and chunks of meat came flying out of the well, A-W-E-S-O-M-E.

Good action like guns and explosions that are big and cool.

How can it get better than this, then all of a sudden a giant one came out of a big crack in the wall and ate a couple of people but still awesome.

BEST MOVIE YET",1298505600,4,464,4.065934065934066
4404681,5,B004LS6CN6,"I'd like to begin by stating that the Mongolian Death Worm is a real creature that has been described to science. Well, to scientists, by people who have spoken to other people who might actually be eyewitnesses. Which is good enough for the Sci Fi channel, you, and me.

Now, don't dismiss this movie as your typical low budget bad acting CGI monster romp. Set in Mongolia in the modern day, this film tracks nonprofit doctors fighting a mysterious water borne plague, foreign oil managers having plant trouble while smuggling stolen treasure on the side, a freelance mercenary archeologist and his straight cop buddy, and some bumbling bandits. That's a lot of plot lines to keep in mind, except that basically everyone on a mission (medical, engineering, smuggling, archeology) keeps having everything go wrong for the same reason. And that reason is Mongolian Death Worms, of course.

I'm sure everyone here is familiar with the book ""Jaws"" by the late Peter Benchley. For all its overt focus on the shark, the real theme of the book, if you will, is how the shark serves as an amplifier, let's say, for the tensions and instabilities of the community, the connection between politics, business speculation, the mob, Brody's relationship with his wife- all thrown into focus by a shark attack. In a similar way, the Mongolian Death Worms that underlie (literally) everyone's problems in the movie are in fact a metaphor for the very real problems in Mongolia at present, that threaten humanitarian missions, responsible investment, and communities there- poverty, remoteness, and most of all corruption.

There is no way to know if this message was the intent of the filmmaker, but the metaphor is definitely there, elevating this budget picture from an entertainingly watchable adventure into a bona fide political statement.",1373155200,4,1830,5.093333333333334
4404682,5,B004LS6CN6,"The title and cover art are a bit deceiving in my opinion. This looks like it's going to be just another monster horror film. Well it isn't. Sean Patrick Flanery's character in this is hilarious! He reminds me of a Han Solo type, always wise-cracking even in threatening circumstances. Flanery's performance alone makes this worth owning. No joke. I don't usually leave reviews, but I just enjoyed this so much I didn't want anyone to pass it up for ""first impression"" reasons. Don't judge this one by it's cover (which isn't bad, but the worms aren't as big of a focus as it appears).",1370649600,4,585,4.634615384615385
4404683,4,B004LS6CN6,"I am going to do something here that I rarely do with a TRUE B movie,,,, this one gets 4, you read correctly,  >  4  < full STARS !!!  Why?  Because it is so VERY entertaining!!!  Almost every actor involved did a fine job in his or her part.  But the overacting, the exceedingly animated overacting, was FANTASTIC!!!  Kudos especially, to Sean Patrick Flanery and his equally over the top nemesis Drew Waters!!!  Is there real creature terror, you bet NOT!  Are there epoch FX?  No, Nodda, Zilch!!  However the Mongolian Death Worms themselves are  pretty cool, I mean, who could not love growling, snarling, caterpillar styled, 500 pound, flesh eating, behemoths such as these!

Gun runner / smuggler / treasure hunter / self proclaimed scientist Daniel (Flanery) has been searching for the tomb of Ghenghis Kahn, or more specifically the reputed treasure entombed with him.  His method of finding it?  Track the (not so) mythical Mongolian Death Worms who, by folklore, are the guardians of the tomb.  Enter oil company.  Enter drilling.  Enter Patrick (Waters) as drill site overseer / scheming bad guy.  Enter overacting and some good entertainment as long as you realize this IS NOT a serious film.  If you take an analytical approach you'll miss iit's true value!!!  Worth every penny, times 10, of what I paid, which was $1 at a pawn shop.  This is a fun film my friends!!!  If you want a change, check it out.  Hats off to Mr. Flanery and his cohorts.  Thank you!",1356480000,2,1472,4.719367588932807
4404684,1,B004LS6CN6,"I knew about the death worms from the writings of the real Indiana Jones, Roy Chapman Andrews. I was hoping for a decent adventure tale, instead I got this piece of crap that had to have been written on toilet paper. When you think of Mongolia you think of deserts, so why was it filmed on Texas grasslands instead of Death Valley or Arizona?  The local Mongolian lawman looked and sounded like a Texas sheriff. This movie is so unspeakably bad and disappointing on so many levels I can't believe it.(At least it wasn't filmed in Romania like High Plains Invaders!)

This movie is the most expensive coaster I'll ever put my drinks on.",1343088000,,635,4.56140350877193
4404685,1,B004LS6CN6,"How can you go wrong with a movie that has a title like this? I mean who DOESN'T want to see a movie with a death worm? Better yet that the title creature comes from Mongolia! My honest guess is that most people (especially younger ones) have no idea where Mongolia is let alone why it would be plagued by death worms. That's a good thing too because most of this movie looks like it was shot in a woods near the film makers home rather than Asia.

An American oil company (it's always nice to have a convenient bad guy in films) is using a new technique to drill in a region of Mongolia. Unfortunately when they do so they awaken a den of death worms, huge slime covered creatures with retractable shooting tongues that swat out to catch their prey. So far so good. Now let's toss some more plots into this.

A rogue archeologist named Daniel is on the run from some smugglers he's apparently crossed paths with. They apparently were helping fund his search for the tomb of Genghis Khan.  Only his friend, a local policeman, saves him. But you know what they say about payback. When a truck transporting two physicians involved in Doctors Without Borders to a small village breaks down and the policeman has another crime to handle, Daniel is recruited to take them to the village.

Complications arise in various ways. Daniel and his doctors are captured by the man trying to find him. They are only saved when the death worms intervene and the bad guys are killed. And if we didn't have enough plots to follow, it turns out that the man overseeing the oil drilling plant was also waiting for the bad guys to transport an illegal shipment he has waiting at the plant. Of course this is where everyone eventually arrives including the death worms.

The story has way too much going on here. The acting is standard but not outstanding. Then again you can only do so much with what you're given. Worst of all is the effects. If this movie wasn't made specifically for SyFy then I would be surprised. It features that same poor CGI creature of the week effects seen in so many of their made for cable movies.

While this isn't the worst movie ever made, it is pretty bad. If you find that it's the last movie on the rental shelf then I would suggest you pull out a deck of cards and play solitaire.",1342569600,,2296,4.416075650118203
4404686,5,B004LS6CN6,"This is a newer SyFy movie. For the most part, the effects are good. The main character is not someone you will like until about halfway through the movie. It's exciting and well-made for a b-movie. This is one of my favorites.",1330732800,2,227,4.428571428571429
4404687,3,B004LS6CN6,"Looks like a Re-Make of the 1980s-90s Sci-Fi Classic ""Tremors"" set in Mexico and SW USA, co-starring Michael Gross. Stick to the original.",1330387200,,138,5.043478260869565
4404688,4,B004LS6CN6,This is a fun movie not to be taken too seriously. Sean Patrick Flanery is good as the slayer of the Mongolian Death Worms. Oscar-worthy it's not but an enjoyable movie for a rainy afternoon.,1316044800,5,191,4.485714285714286
4404689,4,B004LS6CN6,"I admit, after so much crap I've watched recently, I wasn't expecting much from this one. Okay, it's not a blockbuster at all, but  what should one expect from this kind of movie? The acting is convincing for the most part, and the effects are decent. The plot is a clich, but the story is fun nonetheless. I'd recommmend it to fans of the genre like me.",1310169600,10,354,4.2835820895522385
4404690,1,B004LS6CN6,"Lately I've had a rather unhealthy obsession with bad movies. Generally ones from the '70s and '80s are better, but I by no means limit myself to those decades when it comes to bad acting, plot holes and laughable effects. So when I saw the name Mongolian Death Worm I got really excited. Sadly, even on the level of entertainingly bad movies, this had very little to offer...

8434779,4,B004LS6CN6,"RELEASED IN 2010 and directed by Steven R. Monroe, Mongolian Death Worm chronicles events on the Mongolian steppe when W.H.O doctors are forced to team-up with a treasure hunter searching for Genghis Khans tomb (Sean Patrick Flanery) to face huge worm-like creatures aroused due to the drilling of an experimental oil plant.

Monroe is a quality horror-budget director, as witnessed by Sasquatch Mountain (2006), Wyvern (2009) and I Spit On Your Grave (2010), so theres nothing wrong with the overall filmmaking in Mongolian Death Worm. Speaking of the title, it should be Mongolian Death Worms seeing as how there are a lot of em, unless its referring to the main (bigger) worm shown at the end.

In any case, the movie worked for me because of (1.) the unique location and situation, (2.) the quality protagonists and their budding relationship played by Flanery (aka Powder and Young Indiana Jones) and cutie Victoria Pratt, who was 39 during filming and looks jaw-dropping in her safari outfit throughout, and (3.) the CGI worms, which are well-done for a TV flick.

A couple of armchair critics dissed the film for not looking like Mongolia, but the Texas prairie basically looks the same as the remote Mongolian steppes (which is all we see in the movie, no villages or cities). True, you usually see vast mountains in the distance in Mongolia, but not always. As far as the police vehicle with POLICE written in English, thats the way it is in Mongolia due to the fact that, although the main language is Mongolian, English has been gradually replacing Russian as the second language.

THE MOVIE RUNS 90 minutes and was shot entirely in central Texas, with studio work done in Dallas. WRITERS: Neil Elman, Kevin Leeson & Monroe.

But alas, the worms were only really, really, really big.  So I was disappointed.  Can you hire some bigger worms for the sequel please!  As for the worm acting.  Well... I believe there are better worm actors out there, but obviously, they are a rare bread... so understandably the production crew had to settle for what they could find.

One aspect of the 'human' acting that I found amusing:  When there was a worm lurking and on the verge of attacking it would make a non-human growling grumbling monster sound (i.e. ""Grrroworworoowwraaaarh""), but the human actors would inquire, ""who's there!  Who is that?"".  Me?  .... if I heard a monster sound like that... I wouldn't be asking such a question.  I'd be getting the F*** out of there.

I give this charming film 4 stars for the fourtitude of the production staff, since ""fivetitude"" doesn't sound quite right.",1380844800,4,1005,4.773255813953488
