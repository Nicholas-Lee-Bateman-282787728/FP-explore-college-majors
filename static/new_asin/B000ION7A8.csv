2661140,5,B000ION7A8,"A wonderful deal! These films are remastered and corrects flaws found in the previous releases. I cannot express now important and entertaining these films are!

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT- Best romantic comedy ever..Period..everything else is a copycat

MR SMITH- small honest hick VS big corrupt politics. The best movie hero ever portrayed!

YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU- caused me to actually live my life the way I want to without worrying about what others think. This is a riot!! Best version of 'Meet the Parents'

MR DEEDS- is 100times better than the remake. The best courtroom scene I ever saw!

Get this Box! Even if you have the other films on DVD allready! Give the old ones to a friend (or better yet an enemy). After all...You Cant Take it with You!",1167782400,12,757,4.661654135338346
2661141,5,B000ION7A8,"Frank Capra's films were always a joy to watch.

They had those characters whose goodness, honesty and will were enough to take America away from the Great Depression era. Something that could only inspire and make you look at the world with brighter eyes.

This box contains FIVE trully memorable films from his best period. FIVE films that really are among his BEST.

MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is one of his best films. In it, James Stewart gives one of his best performances as the young idealist who fights corruption in the Senate. A major American film.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a legendary romantic comedy with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - the first film to win all five major Oscars (go figure why... :P). Delightful!

MR.DEEDS GOES TO TOWN stars the great Gary Cooper who just inherits 20 million Dollars and feels he must give it to those who really need it.

YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU packs another stellar cast with James Stewart, Jean Arthur and Lionel Barrymore. The best corn you'll ever see!! (-laughs)

AMERICAN MADNESS is a lesser gem with Walter Huston as a bank president in the depths of the Great Depression.

PLUS: a great documentary about Capra's life, style and work filled with great insight by many top names like ROBERT ALTMAN.

This box contains 5 films not to be missed at a great price... full of extras... commentaries, remastered picture and sound... everything to give you a great in-depth look into one of the greatest director who ever lived.

...Someone who really had something to say.

Get this box and treasure it.",1162166400,53,1566,4.74169741697417
2661150,5,B000ION7A8,"Frank Capra, the film directorr, directed movies that are very well done and often inspiring.  Many of his movies are easy to recognize by his own craft that goes into them, good dialogue performed with perfect timing, the capturing of the beauty or wonder of life portrayed in a simple scene... And I think that one could say also that the major thing that most of his movies have is heart.",1474761600,,391,4.507042253521127

2661154,5,B000ION7A8,"IN ORDER FOR A MOVIE OR SERIES TO  BE GREAT, IT NEEDS TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY THE VERY REAL STRUGGLE THAT EACH OF US MUST FACE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.  STORIES THAT ARE MORALITY PLAYS TEACH US ABOUT LIFE WHILE ENTERTAINING US.  WE CAN'T HELP BEING REMINDED ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES WHEN WE WATCH THEM.  GREAT PRODUCTIONS LIKE SVENGALI (1931), MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (1936), MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939), WIZARD OF OZ (1939), MEET JOHN DOE (1941), SUPERMAN, STAR TREK, STAR WARS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (TOS), WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, AND SPARTACUS (MOVIES & SERIES) WILL ALWAYS BE HELD IN HIGH REGARD BY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT SEE THEM.  SAME WITH BIOGRAPHICAL FILMS OF INSPIRATIONAL PEOPLE SUCH AS QUEEN ELIZABETH I, ""AMAZING GRACE"" (WILBERFORCE), THE FOUNDING FATHERS, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WINSTON CHURCHILL, ""SCHINDLER'S LIST,""  MARTIN LUTHER KING, ETC.  SUCH PEOPLE ARE HEROES OF FREEDOM AND MORALITY.  CHRISTIANS!  CHRISTIANS ARE THE MOST LOVING, FORGIVING PEOPLE THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN!  WITHOUT US FREEDOM WOULD NOT EXIST!  WE SERVE THE GOD THAT LOVES EVERYONE AND HAS GIVEN ALL WHO ACCEPT HIS SON AS LORD AND SAVIOR THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE!
GOOD VS EVIL PRODUCTIONS ARE GREAT WAYS TO EDUCATE PEOPLE OR YOUR MINOR RELATIVES ABOUT GOD, WITHOUT THEIR REALIZATION THAT THE FILMS HAVE GODLY VALUES IN THEM.  SUCH FILMS FACILITATE DEEP DISCUSSIONS.  VIEWERS WILL MORE LIKELY ACCEPT/OBTAIN BIBLES/MOVIES ABOUT THE BIBLE, AND USE THEIR TALENTS TO LOVE GOD AND OTHERS.
PRODUCTIONS THAT ENTIRELY DENY GOD, THE DEMONS, AND ABSOLUTES, TEND TO LEAVE YOU FEELING WORSE THAN BEFORE YOU WATCHED THEM.  THEY TEACH YOU TO EAT, DRINK, AND BE MERRY AND TAKE EVERYONE FOR EVERYTHING YOU CAN, FOR TOMORROW WE DIE.  IN THEM, THERE ARE NO PEOPLE TO LOOK UP TO, NO HEROES THAT RESIST EVIL WITH LOVE, TRUTH, JUSTICE AND THE AMERICAN WAY!  THEY TAKE AWAY HOPE.  THEY TAKE AWAY LOVE.  THEY ENCOURAGE HATRED, GREED, AND DECEPTION.  THE god OF HATRED, GREED, AND DECEPTION (SATAN) WINS MORE SOULS FOR HELL BY ENCOURAGING EVERYONE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.  THIS ""NEW WAY OF THINKING"" GOES BACK TO SATAN'S SUCCESSFUL TEMPTATION OF ADAM AND EVE.

2661156,5,B000ION7A8,"I thank Turner Classic Movies & IMDB for helping me build up my Video Library of the greated movies ever made. This boxed gem of movie icons giving there best in acting & directing just boosted my library of some 600 titles a half star.  I am very knowledgeable of the movie industry & a buff especially the Western genre.  Closely behind the 1930s to 1940s Classics in all genre with a favorable taste for Screwball Comedic Romanicism with a slight twist of light Drama.  The greatness of a classic movie having 2-3 flavors in it with a cast of some of the best actors in lead & supporting roles being directed by a master will win Oscars. This box set is a Masterpiece.  It's to bad Lionel Barrymore had come on in age since leaving  the Silent era he performed in. We all would of had more of him for he was such a great. In fact my 1st viewing of a Silent film, he was the star in it. There is a treasure trove of great films in the industry. They are as good today as they were in there era. & can be viewed in your own Home Theater. Generations change, but funny is always funny  & these icons have passed away leaving Masterpieces behind.  I do miss seeing them at the Academy Awards & I remember when some classic movies first appeared on tv before cable  our mother would tell us.  The tv networks would call it ""The Sunday Movie of the Week "" .or "" The 5 O'Clock Big Show "" weekday.  Better then 70 % never made it to TV until "" Turner Classic Movie ""  was introduced some 20 yrs ago.  A rebirth of the 30s & 40s movies came alive. My younger wife had said she didn' t know how good they were as I introduced her to some Oscar winners & nominated ones. I told her she was watching a remake & the original was so much better  The industry is formatting them in BD little at a time,  remastering those in DVD  for audio/video,  creating  more box sets with extras in them from the icons themslves..  The TV Smart technology  with large  screens .. These classics being played on audio/video components or streamed to devices, one could not tell the age of them looking like they were just made.  I do not mind a black & white , it's a better b & w today.  Some  have  been colorized & that will become  a choice.

2661185,5,B000ION7A8,"Watching these films, I've had my heart opened again.  Modern filmmakers give it a great shot--they do some good work, They still make it seem like a possibility.  But is it a possibility that real Americans (or anyone) would still pull together in times of even the minutest, personalized and localized trouble is the real question, isn't it?  Capra believed it like ultimate truth.  In a world of diverse individualists (and I'm not saying that individualism is a bad thing), with our media as it is, it's difficult to recognize how often we really do stand  up for the little guy--which is all the time. Yet, all that pulling together for personal and larger causes seems like fantasy in a world that promotes so much division, so much fighting, so much ""me first"" -ing (I'm so much better than you-ing, which makes me more deserving, bah!).

Nobody made the message of our interdependency, on either a large or small scale, seem as essential as Capra--and he did it with such finesse!  Anyone is capable of it--and everyone.  His films depict how real people emote, right or wrongly, over their lives, and how one person can stand up and make a difference or how one person standing up for another is just as important as the larger, national act. For Capra, all acts of this kind were the basis of what really made a country the greatest country in the world.

That world is a lot different now, larger, less and less to do with countries, so applying Capra's theories to a larger scale seems even more impossible than ever.  But he did see reality.  The core of human spirit can still forge an entire country to greatness.  And he knew something else about the human spirit--that we (as individuals) would always crave to be great like that, always.  No matter what the real world hands us, in our hearts, most of us will always seek exactly that spirit--through heart and through action.",1414886400,2,1894,4.668674698795181

2661221,5,B000ION7A8,"Frank Capra was famous for an unrelated series of films that were described as Capracorn by many.  In these films an American 'everyman' took on the establishment and won.  He always got the girl and the love of what might be described as the crowd of unknown Americans- average citizens who had been given the short end of the stick in our society durring the depression.  This set contains his best films made while at Columbia Studio in his early days of directing.  These films, with my ratings, are 1. American Madness(3 stars), 2. It Happened One Night(5 stars), 3 Mr. Deeds Goes to Town(4 stars), 4. You Can't Take It with You(4 stars), and 5. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington(5 stars).  This set also has a DVD with some excellant extras on it.  The best movie in this set is It Happened One Night-the best love story ever put on film.  Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is the best film about the way American politics should be every made.  Even American Madness, the movie I rated lowest in this set, is enjoyable.  If you watch any movies at all, and i mean ANY movies at all, you will be glad you have this set.  Highest possible recommendation.",1388102400,3,1149,4.480769230769231

I also appreciated the bonus feature, ""Frank Capra's American Dream"", giving many more details about his films and mostly his creative genius in capturing the ""American experience"" of the 1930's.

In the 1995 movie ""The American President"" staring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, she has a discussion with the Security Guard as she enters the White House for the first time.  He described the ""Capra-esque feeling"" she is experiencing and I believe this feeling is a warm & fuzzy that the DVDs in this collection give you as you watch.

All of the movies here were interesting, clean fun and well done.  Make sure you watch the Narrative section with Mr. Capra's son.  You will learn a great deal of the back stories behind the movies topic, filming schedule, people's opinions and just nice stuff about his Dad.  We were so pleased to watch movies without language, scenes and violence that so crowd our screens today.  This is well worth the money.

It includes three of Capra's most essential films--Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), It Happened One Night (1934), and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)--and two enjoyable but ""second tier"" entries--American Madness (1932) and You Can't Take it With You (1938). Meanwhile, bonus disc, ""Frank Capra's American Dream,"" narrated by Ron Howard, is one of the best and most comprehensive documentaries about a director I've ever seen. Indispensable.

That said, I can't understand why any serious Capra collection would omit the remarkable yet historically-overlooked classic, Meet John Doe (1941), starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, both at the top of their games. If you buy The Premiere Frank Capra Collection, make sure you augment it with Meet John Doe. You may or may not agree with my opinion that it's the best Capra film of all, but if you like Frank Capra, I promise you won't be disappointed.",1352160000,,994,5.098159509202454

2661269,5,B000ION7A8,"I discovered this box because of an interview in which one of my heroes Emir Kusturica deplored the junk Hollywood makes nowadays, referring to Frank Capra as one of his heroes.  Apparently, the heroes of my heroes turn out to be my heroes too.

When watching this box, I vaguely remembered having seen some of those pictures as a boy in the '70s on television.  What a revelation to watch those pictures again, and becoming aware of the greatness of Capra.  Capra was an engineer, and began in Hollywood as a gagman.  He stepped up the ladder, and became the first director to win the five most important Oscars for one of his films (the romantic comedy ""It happened one night"", 1934).  He later on had his own studio, but that was one step beyond, although the name of his own studio revealed his political stand : LIBERTY STUDIOS !

The pictures I most loved from this box have to do with it.  The liberty of moral choice : what would you do would you receive, out of the blue, an inheritance of 20 million dollars ?  (""Mr Deeds goes to town"", 1936).  And what has happened to our democratic liberties, what happened to the government of the people, by the people, and for the people ?  The political corruption has seldom been displayed so well as in ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"", 1939.

But above all, Capra is a great moviemaker.  The message is an essential part, but you will watch witty dialogue, complex characters, great acting, smart storytelling, romance, hope and dreams.  And a laugh from time to time.  This is what movies are really about.  How great Capra was in his time, and how low Hollywood has sunk nowadays !  I am a fan, yes.  And I hope I can convince you to become one also.

What people sometimes forget is how well it's aged. Sure, it's a black & white film from 1939, but it feels surprisingly modern. The film is pretty sophisticated about how politics is really conducted, but also has a feel-good outcome. I recently re-watched this movie to help explain to my little sister how a filibuster works. It helps to know a bit about politics before watching the movie, or at least know what a filibuster and quorum are. It also raises some interesting political ethics questions (is it right to filibuster a whole bill just to oppose one bad provision), but that's probably beyond the scope of Hollywood.",1301184000,,866,5.936

They are personal favorites of mine and I watch them regularly.  Clark Gable never shined so brightly in a movie and Gary Cooper had a light side that glows in his Capra films.  They are having fun and it is contagious!  Jimmy Stewart is able to be a nice guy who has some tough choices to make in his movies.  You Can't Take It With You is a fun film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1937.  It is a madcap romp about a fun wheeling family whose daughter is marrying into a moneyed family.  What is right?  Having fun all the time or working all the time, what is the balance?  American Madness is a good film and very interesting in Capra's repertoire.  The documentaries are very interesting and I came to enjoy the commentaries by Frank Capra Jr. for all the films.  A necessary collection for film buffs.",1263686400,,946,4.318181818181818
2661273,5,B000ION7A8,"This is a review of the five film box set entitled THE PREMEIERE FRANK CAPRA
COLLECTION released by Sony.  It contains five of Mr. Capra's biggest movies plus
a bonus disc with a documentary entitled ""Frank Capra's American Dream.""

The films included are:

AMERICAN MADNESS (1932)  Walter Huston, Pat O'Brien, Kay
Johnson, Constance Cummings. Supposedly the only time Capra used a
sympathetic portrait of a banker, I guess savings and loan officials aren't
bankers, this is a really fine piece of movie artistry made just as  Capra
really found his voice and all the elements are already here.
Beleagured hero saved by his own pluck and his many friends' willingness to
believe in his honesty and acumen. Truly enjoyable, another Depression era
classic...and still relevant today almost eighty years later.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT(1934).  Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert,
Walter Connoly, Rosco Karns. It's impossible to over- rate this comedy
classic, one fine scene after another. From a hitch hikiing tutorial to
donut dunking lessons and learning the second chorus of ""The Man On the
Flying Trapeze"" to discovering The Walls of Jericho this multi- Oscar winner
as it all. Worth seeing many times over.

MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (1936). Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur,
George Bancroft, Lionel Stander, Douglas Dumbrille. Frank Capra and writer
Robert Risken hit thier stride with this Depression era comedy drama
featuring wonderful performances by Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. At this
point Cooper almost didn't have to say anything, his facial expressions and
body language acted for him. Another marvelous film, one to watch
repeatedley.

YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (1938).  Jean Arthur, Lionel
Barrymore, James Stewart, Edward Arnold, Spring Byington. Film version of a
hit Broadway play seems kind of flat to me. I thnk that it was filmed a
little late to be effective, again the Depression seems to hang over the
proceedings despite the protagonsits insistance that they are going to go
through life doing whatever they and the other household members want to do.

That ideology does not include the two servants who are treated qiute well
although it's doubtful that they enjoy doing most of the laundry, cleaning
and cooking, freeing everyone else to pursue their artistic careers. In any
event, the big bad wolf comes knocking at the door and somehow everyone's
bacon is eventually saved.
The weakest film in the five movie Capra box set but still interesting.

MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939).  James Stewart, Jean
Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold. A Capra milestone,
controversial in its time as well as instructive and almost hopelessly
idealistic. A truly terrific film with great performances and chock full of
drama and comedy as well as a bucket full of freshly popped ""Capra corn.""
An important movie which presented a pretty fair picture of our democracy to
the world just before WWII broke out. Even places that didn't have elections
still had greed and corruption and could understand and identify with our
problems.

Even the least of these movies is well worth seeing more than once and also
included is a documentary entitled ""Frank Capra's American Dream,"" which just
adds even more value to this excellent box set.

You cannot go wrong with this fine collection of classic Capra.",1260144000,7,3321,5.101476014760148
2661284,5,B000ION7A8,"This set is a great value and excellent quality!  So far, we have watched only ""It happened one night"" but that was a great way to start enjoying this set. The picture and sound are about as good as it gets for movies of this age and the price per movie that you pay in this set is well worth the money. Enjoy!",1257638400,,310,3.9206349206349205

It is beyond wonderful... it is Capraesque. & though it doesn't include It's a Wonderful Life, it really captures his aspirations of inspiration. He's not trying to beat you over the head with meanings and messages. He lets you sort them out for yourself to your liking. Other than Hitchcock, I really can't think of any other director more classic than Capra. Personally, I prefer Capra. He let his stars shine and become the characters he truly wanted them to be. In a sense, he was early Hollywood's answer to the daily trials and tribulations of everyday people. He let his ideals walk the tightrope we call life through his films and prove that they were both worthy of being called classic.",1237766400,,758,4.75
2661287,4,B000ION7A8,"Frank Capra Collection is essential viewing for anyone who loves movies.  The acting, the quirky stories, the humor and seriousness all resonate today as they did 60 years ago.  The stories are timeless in their views into the human heart.  Look at ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in the light of the Obama ascendency.

I also like the slightly ""wacky"" point of view of several of the movies.
They are a national treasure.",1235952000,5,421,4.726027397260274
2661288,5,B000ION7A8,"Frank Capra was one of the greatest pioneers in film history.  He made movies that made you think about life and what all was involved in it.  He warmed our hearts by trying to remind us that there is still good in the world.

My personal favorite thing is the music.  Whether it was him personally or just the musicians he was fortunate enough to work with, the music in a Frank Capra film is astounding.  Wonderful intros and outros and wonderful momental music that grabs your attention.

If you buy one set of Capra's works, this is the one.  These films are among his most celebrated.  All of them are on one disc a piece, no dual discs (having to get up in the middle of a movie) or anything like that.  I recommend getting this with It's a Wonderful Life, then you'll have all the Frank Capra you need!!!",1230422400,,811,4.317880794701987
2661289,5,B000ION7A8,"This was exactly what I expected it to be. My husband LOVED it for his birthday present. It had all the Capra Movies you could want, with the exception of Meet John Doe. And the price is right!",1227052800,2,193,4.105263157894737
2661290,5,B000ION7A8,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is not only the best Frank Capra film, it's one of the best films ever. Some would want to limit to that to a genre, but if popularity counts for anything, it would be the people's choice. What's number two in the Caprian list? I'd say Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. In my view this Cooper vehicle is quite a bit better than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, although in some ways they seem to be the same movie. But Capra arguably had one message, which he said over and over again. In Mr Deeds, he says it with wit and savvy. It's a plain man/ common man anthem that makes you rejoice to be alive.

Longfellow Deeds is what Chesterton called ""another kind of priest"", a poet, and a particularly looked-down upon sort-- the sort that writes greeting cards and rhyming verse. Cooper's co-star is the unsinkable Jean Arthur. Modern audiences dismiss such films out of hand: they're black and white, for one thing; predictable for another; and the inevitable happy ending doesn't sit well in a cynical world. All that aside, as the people at the Library of Congress knew when they restored this film, and the people at Turner Classic Movies knew when they showed it, and which many viewers of this set know when they watch it, there are a lot of things going on here that are frankly dazzling, and in a filmic sense, for moderns tired of the switch it on, fast, hard, and, in its own way predictable modern fare of Hollywood, black and white is the new color.

You Can't Take It With You plays well as a play, which is what it once was, and often is, as it remains one of the most popular comedies for small theater groups to put on, but it largely fails in this movie, for the same reason that many early cartoons similarly do. Both were made to fill their bill in the theater line-up (at a time when a newsreel and cartoon presented the feature film), and the fact of animation was dazzling enough on it's own without the later Disney innovation of a story line. In retrospect, this film would make a better musical, and I'm surprised someone hasn't redone it as one. Nevertheless, it provides yet another angle on Capra's populist dream at a time when the melting pot of America was sorely in need of an injection of celluloid hope.

And humor. It Happened One Night is the quintessential screwball comedy, which the stylish Claudette Colbert was barely induced to play in. That already gives it a bit of a twist. Add the chemistry of Clark Gable who, again, was not entirely up for the film, and you get a spontaneity of the Buster Keaton sort without the spinning houses. TCM has a very deluxe package version of this film, but here one can see for oneself what the much-derided genre of screwball comedy was all about, with the result that one may just become an addict of it like this reviewer.

If you like Capra at all,  you likely already own some version of It's a Wonderful Life, so here are a few more of his Cupid's arrows from the days when cinema had a heart, which just may make you fall in love with life all over again.",1217116800,3,3049,4.408525754884547

2661320,5,B000ION7A8,"It was a happy day for me when I learned that this collection was being isssued and when it arrived from Amazon my first act was to cancel all my appointments, take the phone off the hook and settle down with a bowl ofpopcorn and discover just what made Frank Capra one of the leading directors of his day and indeed for all time. I was not disappointed. Along with favorites like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""You Can't Take it with You"" were ""It Happened One Night"" (which I had not seen in years and did not recall how good it was) and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" Also included in this set is a fabulous collection of films documenting just how Frank Capra was able to produce his fabulous collection of films. It is rare that great classics of American cinema get the attention and treatment that they deserve, but this is one of those rare instances of the material being treated in the appropriate manner.

It really would be silly for me to try to capture the magic and craftsmanship that went into making these fabulous films. Capra had a particular talent for being to tap into the fundamental aspects of what it meant to be an American in the 1930s and 1940s and this talent is on full display in this collection.  They contain some marvelous performances, particularly by Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Claudette Caulbert and in particular Jean Arthur.  While Capra's autobiography does contain it share of myths, the chapters that detail the efforts it took to get these performances down on film is probably worth consulting for the insights it provides.

If I were to fault it for one or two things it would be the omission of two classics in the Capra canon.  These are ""Meet John Doe"" which really is crying out for a restoration and a proper release on DVD and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" These movies are probably excellent examples of Capra's creativity, but as this fine collection proves, they are by no means the only ones.

I hope that other directors are in line for similar treatments in the future.  However it is doubtful if future efforts will surpass this one for its overall excellence.",1180569600,39,2127,4.596306068601583
2661321,5,B000ION7A8,"This DVD collection is obviously going to be popular with sure fire entertainments such as ""You Can't take it with You"" and ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" but the package goes much further by providing lengthy interviews with Capra's son about each of the films, a detailed documentary about Capra himself, expert commentaries with each film and a detailed booklet.  This is outstanding value.

All of the films are excellent and Amazon themselves provide worthwhile summaries.  Here are a few observations:

- ""Mr Deeds goes to Town"" is my least favourite and probably most guilty of what is called ""Capra corn"".  Gary Cooper was often a mannered actor and for me he overdoes his ""Aw shucks"" country bumpkin. Jean Arthur compensates enormously, making believable that this worldly ""babe"" could fall for Mr Deeds. She helps Cooper enormously to pull off his performance.
- ""American Madness"", made in 1932 before Capra really hit the bigtime, benefits from a shorter running time with a fast pace created by the editing. At the height of the Depression, a story about a run on a bank was timely and the note of optimism sounded by the resolution was refreshing.  Walter Huston is outstanding as the head of the bank and the serene Kay Johnson, a poised and beautiful presence in any film, plays his wife.  The film has one great set and Capra moves his camera around it, including some powerful overhead shots.  His crowd scenes are outstanding as always.
- Jean Arthur was a wonderful actress and if her parts in each film are quite similar, it doesn't matter. With her husky inimitable voice and warm smile, she is memorable.
- Clark Gable is very funny in ""It happened One Night"", a very underrated comedian.
- ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" has similarities to ""Mr Deeds"" but is superior in every way. The documentaries tell that in fact, it was originally conceived as a sequel. James Stewart is much more convincing than Gary Cooper and the yarn has far more tension then the earlier film.  It is much less dated. The film was very popular on its release except in Washington where the depiction of political corruption was considered ""un-American"".

All of the prints are good, although ""It happened One Night"" suffers from grainy scenes.  The films benefit from Capra's attention to detail, particularly the character actors which populated his films. The documentaries tell us that actors lived to appear in a Capra film because they knew that even the smallest part would be treated with loving attention. The most amusing story about this is the casting of Harry Cary in ""Mr Smith"" as the Speaker in the Senate. On paper, the part was minor but there are numerous telling close ups as he reflects the audience reaction to what is happening. It is a very important role.

The documentary about Capra himself tells of his beginnings as an Italian immigrant.  Undoubtedly, his own rise from humble beginnings influenced his view of America as the land of opportunity and his depiction of the power of the people.  He lived the ""American Dream"". Even if you are uncomfortable with the idealism expounded in most of the films (Capra corn), each film tells a good story and provides great entertainment.",1180483200,6,3206,4.858715596330275
2661322,5,B000ION7A8,"Mr. Capra is an excellent, pro-American director.  He believes in the USA.....his movies prove it.

I have to add one thing: I got this at a brick-'n'-mortar store for $7.50.
I asked the department manager  WHY a 6-disc collection [with a small book!] was priced at a
