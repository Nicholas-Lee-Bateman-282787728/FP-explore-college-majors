2057889,5,B00023E88U,"I watched this when I was ten, back in the days when fifty cents would buy you a pack of baseball cards, a candy bar and a fountain Coke at the local drugstore and the cards came with that stick of gum that tasted lousy, but if you threw it at your siblings, they stayed out of your room for days!
Ever since Cartoon Network created those bumper promos poking fun at the Legion of Doom (for example, having the Powerpuff Girls wipe the floor with them and Braniac complaining that he never had a pair of pants), I've been hoping that the entire series would come out on DVD. Finally, after putting out just a few of them, they came out with the entire season, complete with a documentary, commentary by two comic book writers who weren't afraid to point out some of the silly parts of the show, some entertaining bios of the entire lineup, but more importantly, all the episodes, uncut.
For many of us, this was our first look at a lot of the DC heroes, such as my favorite, the (Hal Jordan) Green Lantern, while all of the top heroes were there to actually fight villains from the comics and not deranged scientists or alien invaders.
The writers even added some of the multi-cultural heroes and surprisingly, worked them into the stories best they could instead of just having them hang around for appearances sake. Ironically, while there was a black Superfriend, and Asian Superfriend and a Native American Superfriend, there was no hispanic Superfriend.
Some of the plots were a little out there even for a cartoon (trying to trap Superman, Wonder Woman and Hawkman in a storybook? Come on, Mojo Jojo could have come up with something better than that!), but most of them seemed plausible in a comic book hero world and kept us interested.
Best of all, the DVD is 100 percent Wonder Twins free!",1089676800,5,1799,4.555555555555555
2057890,5,B00023E88U,"This series is my favorite of the entire ""Superfriends"" bunch because it has the coolest villians of all, the Legion of Doom,
fighting against all the best members of the Justice League, without all the annoying ones like the Wonder Twins or Wendy and Marvin. The extras are nice too...I esp. liked the bios of all the heroes and villians. All your favorite characters are here...you certainly get our money's worth with this one, and the feeling of nostalgia produced by watching these episodes is
worth the price of admission.",1089158400,3,528,4.877777777777778
2057891,4,B00023E88U,it's really good to have the super friends all together on this DVD.this use to be a really cool Show to watch early in the Morning back in the day.it's cool that it's finally coming out on DVD.,1088208000,2,194,4.131578947368421
2057892,5,B00023E88U,"I remember being 6 years old and waking my brother up every Saturday morning so we could watch the Superfriends.  Looking back on this show now, I'm amazed at how campy it is, especially with the disco music soundtrack.  But this show is one of my fondest memories from my early childhood, and watching it makes me wish that I was still innocent and oblivious to the problems of the world.  From watching the Superfriends, I learned that good always triumphed over evil, that stealing a pack of gum would get you a lecture from the Wonder Twins, and to make sure you are in control when riding your skateboard downhill.
This season (and I do believe there was only one season, so I'm not sure why they are calling it ""The Complete First Season"" instead of ""The Complete Series"") was the best.  I loved the concept of this band of superheroes battling against a counterpart band of supervillains.  The seasons tend to blur together, but I do believe this is the one with the hokey Safety, Arts and Crafts, and Magic vignettes at the very end of each show.
The other versions, like ""World's Greatest"" and especially the Darkseid ""Galactic Guardians"", don't hold a candle to ""Challenge"".  It's too bad they didn't make more episodes with the Legion of Doom.  I wonder why they went the direction they did.",1087948800,10,1302,4.6347826086956525
2057893,5,B00023E88U,"SuperFriends was an escape for me as a child because it kept me out of trouble and mostly it was enjoyable.  You don't get the same of cartoons today as you did in the 70s or 80s but having said that one of my favorite characters are the Wonder Twins.  The Cartoon Network televised that during the Basketball Allstar's Favorite Cartoon pick and Jersey Net's Jason Kidd also said that he liked the Wonder Twins.  As a result, we were treated with 4 short episodes of the Wonder Twins.  Now if only the rest would come out on DVD Complete Season Sets.",1087689600,2,550,4.362745098039215
2057894,2,B00023E88U,"I remember watching Challenge Of The Superfriends and it was an hourlong show. The first story was a Superfriends story which had the main Superfriends (Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Wondertwins and Gleek) followed by the Legion Of Doom stories. Now I don't know whether the Superfriends stories shown on Challenge were wiped or whether the people putting out this collection are deliberetly ignoring those stories. Regardless of the reason, this is not a complete Challenge Of The Superfriends collection and I won't buy any Challenge collection unless it's complete because it's only fair to us if it is complete.",1087344000,2,637,5.254901960784314
2057895,5,B00023E88U,"""Banded together from remote galaxies, are 13 of the most sinister villains of all time - the Legion of Doom! Dedicated to a single objective: the conquest of the universe! Only one group dares to challenge this intergalactic threat - the Superfriends!""

That's how announcer Stanley Jones (voice of Lex Luthor) opened this classic show from 1978. The opening scenes showing the Riddler caught [like a deer in headlights] in Batman's spotlight, and Black Manta tied up atop a whale ""piloted"" by Aquaman still look cool.

The appeal of Challenge of the Superfriends is in the fact that they waged an ongoing battle against actual villains from the comic books. Most of which were direct counterparts i.e. Green Lantern/Sinestro, Flash/Captain Cold, Batman/Scarecrow, etc. So the battles never got repetitive the writers wisely mix-matched the contenders. And don't forget the Legion's very cool Darth Vader-headed headquarters based underneath the swamp.

THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA: Superman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern, Black Vulcan, Samurai, and Apache Chief.
VS.
THE LEGION OF DOOM: Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Solomon Grundy, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Bizarro, Cheetah, Black Manta, Giganta, Gorilla Grodd, Sinestro, Captain Cold, and the Toyman.

2057915,4,B00023E88U,The perfect series to introduce my kid to superheroes. The story are fun without being to complicated or too violent. The focus is on fun stories even if they don't make a lot of sense. The best part is there aren't any twins.,1427673600,,226,4.27906976744186
2057916,4,B00023E88U,"Like so many vintage animated features that are now iconic classics, new generations don't always bond with these iterations as well as those of us who actually grew up watching them new. The Super-Friends was certainly one of the most colorful animated features of it's days, loaded with heroes and villains galore. What I personally enjoy most about these animated classics, is the fact there is an innocence and black and white perspective not skewed by the pop psychology of today's social media generation. There is good versus evil and the sides are defined.

But what I think really established Super-Friends as a long sustained hit through the 70's into the 80's was it's unabashed pride in showcasing so many heroes and villains in the DC universe. There had never been a show that dug so deep into the comic vaults before the Super-Friends, and Hanna-Barbara took great pride in exploring that universe. Believability? Plotting? Realism? What person of any era sits down to apply those expectations to a universe inhabited by this cast of players? This is for the young and more importantly young at heart. If you can believe a man can fly, the rest should be icing on the cake. The Super-Friends serves up a good time for all.",1425168000,,1237,4.834905660377358

As an added bonus, since this is a sealed DVD set, I also got a coupon to save $12 on 2 tickets for the movie Catwoman.  I have wanted to see it since it was released (in July 2004) so I can finally cross it off my bucket list.",1424649600,,408,3.7209302325581395

The problem was, we didn't have a lot of options back in the 70s for superheros on TV so I didn't care or notice that they talked a ton, didn't really fight anyone and the stories moved slow. So in a last ditch effort, I bought this one because it was the first year with the Legion of Doom and I figured maybe that would help. What a difference real villains and interesting adversaries make. This was the Super Friends I remembered! My son loves this one, whereas the original one he got bored with quickly. It is still vintage, bad 70s kids cartoons, but in a good way. Skip the original seasons and start with the Challenge of the Super Friends.",1423612800,3,779,4.27027027027027

2057932,5,B00023E88U,I bought this dvd from the Superfriends dvd  set because it was to me the best season. The Challenge of The Superfriends was the beginning of how we see the  DC Comic characters as we do now. I like the fact they put a lot of thought into the episodes and I also liked the Wonder Woman scenes. I bought it for that alone. I know they did a Justice League dvd that sort of brings this back for this day and age. It was called Justice League Doom.

Though not as sophisticated as the Justice League, as an adult there is still an appreciation for seeing Black Vulcan, Apache Chief, and Samurai in one collection. All the exposition tends to get on my nerves as an adult, but as a child, this was must-see Saturday morning television. The voices and characterizations were interchangeable, but nonetheless, enjoyable, then and now.

2057947,5,B00023E88U,"This DVD brings back some of my most cherished childhood cartoon memories.  I can remember watching these on Saturday mornings, and when I found out that they were released on DVD, I snapped this up right away.  What a great treat!

Now, let's state a few obvious caveats.  The video quality is almost 40 years old, so it's clearly not as good as today's standards.  The stories may not be very intricate, but again, we've come a long way.  Also, the stories may not reflect the full details of the histories of the Superfriends and the Legion of Doom, but a lot of fictional history has been written since them.

But are these reasons good enough NOT to buy this?  No.  If you saw this show as a child and loved it (like I did), then this set is for you.  The episodes are short (~20 minutes) and the stories are fun to watch.

Perhaps one of the greatest parts of this set is that it makes one want to go explore the origins of the Superfriends and the Legion of Doom.  By searching the internet, you will learn that the histories of these characters is a lot more intricate than that which is portrayed in this DVD set.  But that's OK, because these stories were not meant to give exhaustive details about the characters.  They were just meant to be plain fun, and that's what they are.

For all of those 1970s children (like me) who can fondly remember their Saturday mornings, this set is for you.  For all of those younger people who want to see how we got where we are today, then this is worth watching, as long as you don't watch it with too critical of an eye.  Let's face it...these were not the best made shows, but for their time, they were state of the art.  And now they are back again for all of us to enjoy.

So go ahead and enjoy them....you will have hours of fun!",1374364800,4,1783,4.268656716417911

2057955,1,B00023E88U,"First, I have to say that I did not watch this show as a kid, so I am not as indulgent as I would have been if nostalgia and happy memories prepared me to watch this. By today's animation standards, this series is almost unbearable to watch. The scripts were obviously written by people who only had very superficial knowledge of the characters. Dialogues and situations are so clumsy that they verge on parody. Although the characters designs are faithful to their comics look of the time, the animation is mediocre and ""action"" is reduced to a minimum. Limited animation was used way better on other Hanna Barbera productions such as Johnny Quest. So my advice is : if you have not watched this when you were a child, and if you enjoy ""Batman the animated series"" , ""The adventures of Superman"" , ""Justice League"" and the other great series produced by Warner in the 90s and later on, don't inflict this on you even by curiosity.",1356220800,,931,4.580838323353293

I really enjoyed watching this series as it ran on the cartoon network in the 90's and just had to get this DVD. There are other seasons out there but they do not include the full cast like this season did. Also if your looking for the kids with the dog or the wonder twins you won't find them here, which in my opinion were the best episodes. Some of this is a little cheezy but I really enjoyed almost every episode and would recommend to anyone whose considering it to purchase this season.",1338508800,,747,4.5
2057957,5,B00023E88U,"Thank you very much to Amazon, and the sub-company that worked with Amazon, to send me this classic cartoon! At first I ordered it from Best Buy, but they said it would take three weeks to a month to receive it, so I took a chance and came on Amazon, and BOY, am I glad I did! I received this DVD set about a week after I ordered it, and even saved a few dollars compared to the price Best Buy was going to charge me.

When I began to watch I was IMMEDIATELY taken back to my childhood of being an 8 year old boy and sitting in front of my little, old black and white television, until my Mom was able to get a color one, and watching these episodes as a little boy. I sat there with my bowl of Cap N' Crunch or HoneyComb cereal and you could not rip me away fron the t.v.! Now, as an adult, I still get so excited simply watching the introduction to the show. I get chills and such a HUGE smile on my face. The feeling for me is unmatched as far as childhood memories go.

I guess this was the beginning of my love of a variety of things because to have 13 super villians and 11 super friends to choose to focus on: Which hero or villian will speak? Which villian will have the next plan to take over the world? Which super heroes will save the day now? Will it be one of them or all of them? I LOVE the anticipation!

Once again, thank you Amazon, and thank you to the company that worked with Amazon to bring me back to a precious time in my life when the world for me was seen as a place of innocence.",1322784000,3,1505,3.9278688524590164

The other seasons have their charm but are a bit dated and can be numbingly boring especially over the course of the hour long episode seasons.  With this particular season we jettison the Silver Age Snapper Carr nods in the likes of Marvin & Wendy or the Blunder I mean Wonder Twins and Gleek!  Those guys are great and kids love, love, love them.  But what do we get instead that makes this set worth owning?  Three words: LEGION OF DOOM.  We retain the awesome music, the coming right at you episode introduction, and the ever present narrator's voice.  All Hannah Barbera awesomeness.  This season tosses in Chairman Lex Luthor giving orders to the likes of swamp zombie Solomon Grundy, sentient computer Brainiac, and kitten costume Cheetah- just to name a few of the 13 (!) super villains.  And while the Hall of Justice just sits there in downtown NYC the Hall of Doom flies, travels through time, and sprouts robo legs to do its occupants nefarious biddings.

2057965,5,B00023E88U,A birthday present to a comic book collector who was very happy with his gift.  Arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.,1245542400,2,126,4.25
2057966,5,B00023E88U,"""Challenge Of The Super Friends"" debuted when I was too young to originally watch or be aware of. Thankfully, this show, and other incarnations of it that ran from 1973-1977, were in reruns(and often partnered up with current versions)for years, so I felt like I grew up on it too, if not during most of the original airings. The show went on until 1985/86 or so, so some of it I saw originally. But this one?. This one takes the cake. Easily the best version of the long running superhero series, ""Challenge"" had what other versions lacked, but were still good and enjoyable. We will get to that in a minute. First, what exactly was this version, which only lasted 1 season and 16 episodes, about?. Read on....

""Challenge"" had the best of the DC heroes, Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and The Flash. There were other heroes included, like Apache Chief, Samurai, Black Vulcan, and Hawkman. They resided in the Hall Of Justice. Elsewhere, there lurked something evil in a menacing swamp. It was none other than the Legion Of Doom!. Residing in an ultra cool hideout(which somewhat resembled Darth Vader's helmet)in a murky swamp, the Legion consisted of some of the worst criminals in the superhero gang's history. The leader of the bunch was Lex Luthor(although it seemed there were others who were bigger, stronger, and could easily overtake Luthor if they wanted too!), and the rest included Bizarro(my personal favorite), Solomon Grundy(an interesting one indeed), Grodd, The Riddler, The Toyman, Cheetah, Brainiac, The Scarecrow, Captain Cold, Sinestro, Giganta and Black Mantra. These dastardly criminals planned and schemed week after week, but our mighty superheroes could always stop them just in time!....and, apparently, could always lose the gang of criminals so they can strike again the following week!.

Episodes were, sadly, too few of this great animated series. Here is what you get - ""Wanted : The Superfriends""(dream machine makes the superhero gang steal valuable items); ""Invasion Of The Fearians""(Aliens want to colonize earth, and enlist the Legion to help do so); ""The World's Deadliest Game""(Members of the gang are sucked into a black hole in outer space); ""The Time Trap""(Legion use a time machine to go back in time to steal valuable riches, and trap the SF in another time); ""Trial Of The Superfriends""(The SF gang have to fight robot copies of themselves); ""Monolith Of Evil""(The legion discover an evil energy source); ""The Gates Of Doom""; ""Secret Origin Of The Superfriends""(Luthor goes back in time to when the SF became superheroes); ""Revenge On Gorilla City""(Grodd enlists the legion to conquer the African city he came from); ""Swamp Of The Living Dead""(SF battle zombies raised from the dead); ""Conquerors Of The Future""; ""The Final Challenge""(The Legion and the SF are swept away to a planet to partake in 1 on 1 battles); ""Fairy Tales Of Doom""(SF are put into fairy tales); ""Doomsday""; ""Superfriends : Rest In Peace""; ""History Of Doom""(The Legion have supposedly conquered earth, and a couple of aliens reverse the damage).

Earlier versions of the show, from what I hear, had the violence and action toned down a lot from concerned parents. ""Challenge"", while not necessarily violent or packed with action to the rooftops, seems to have avoided some of that. It's more fun, adventurous, with the superfriends doing more, and the evil villains as well. Like I said before, all of this easily makes it the best version of the show. It offered the best, in terms of scripts and villains, for the superhero show. But how is it, really?. How does it hold up?. The series, and it's heroes, come from a long ago time when it wasn't all doom and gloom, and the people saving you weren't on the fence of being a hero or villain. Things were a lot simpler. How refreshing it was to go back to something lighter and simpler. It may seem pretty cheesy and dated to some now, but that's the beauty of it. Part of the charm and nostalgia of it all. It was a comic book come to life, with superheroes being superheroes, the way we originally remember them. As for the animation, a lot of reviewers on the web have called out the show for it's old school, dated animation, and how crude it was. Not to mention, some drawing mistakes. To me, all for the better. It looks how I remember a lot of cartoons to look, and how I prefer them. With very, very few exceptions, I loathe a great deal of today's TV animation, especially ones dealing with superheroes. Just not a fan. A lot of people see these animation things as a drawback, and something that hurts the show, but it's part of what makes it for me. What I want to see. And finally, the voices. Some may not be household names, but they are some of the best voiceover people ever. Danny Dark as Superman, Olan Soule as Batman, Casey Kasam as Robin. Ted(""The Addams Family"")Cassidy as Brainiac. Good work here.

As for special features, nothing earth shattering, unfortunatley. We get a very short featurette called ""Saturday, Sleeping Bags And Super Friends: A Retrospective"", which is a brief examination of the show. It's pretty fluffy stuff, but the people interviewed are clearly fans and are ecstatic to be there, talking about it, and that the show is now currently available on DVD. Elsewhere, we get character bios of each member of the Hall Of Justice and Legion Of Doom. There is also commentary on two episodes by comic book writers Geoff Johns and Mark Waid.

""Challenge Of The Superfriends"", in all it's 1970's glory, is a warm trip back to Nostalgia land for a lot of people. It was the best Superhero cartoon, and now it's on DVD for everyone to go back into the past, and maybe pass it on to their own kids or grandkids. The animation and writing may not be 100% up to snuff for some, but as something I fondly remember with great feeling, I couldn't ask for more. It brought back the memories, and I loved going thru this set tremendously. I think everyone will. And the best part?. No Gleek!.",1243900800,4,6020,4.779058597502401
2057967,5,B00023E88U,"While babysitting our friends' son and daughter, the topic of superheroes came up.  The superheroes of today have nothing on the Superfriends we grew up watching.  They spent two hours on the computer just learning about all the superfriends, the Hall of Justice, and the Legion of Doom.  The boy's birthday was the next week and the choice for a present was a no-brainer.  He loved it.  Now he and his sister can enjoy the superheroes we all grew up watching.",1227052800,,460,4.62962962962963
2057968,3,B00023E88U,"Well I finally completed my tour of the first Superfriends box set and can honestly state that this volume is seriously the equivalent of a caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis.  How so? Well it's clear that the early episodes contained residual spillover from the 1977 (and earlier) seasons in that the writers weren't quite familiar with the power of the Legion of Doom at their disposal.  As such the initial episodes retain plots with very grand schemes laced with loads of space travel, black holes, inter-dimensional portals and so on.  By about the halfway point of the first disc, things take a turn for the better.  It's as if suddenly the show's writers realized that they had 13 villains (each with interesting back stories) at their service.

The plots become richer and better fleshed out as the season progresses and the ridiculousness of helmet-less space travel and Flash with the ability to fly along-side Superman begin to disappear.

Interestingly enough, the first 8 episodes of this set have been released before: The first four as Attack of the Legion of Doom and the next four in United They Stand.  Despite having purchased both of these stand-alone sets prior, I had to order this one as well so as to enjoy the remaining 8 episodes of the 1978 season.

Also oddly enough, there are special features on the stand-alone sets that, for whatever reason, didn't make it on this complete season box in the form of episode introductions by story editor Jeffery Scott (which was surprisingly interesting).  However, I suppose Warner realized that such differences may be beneficial in maintaining sales of the prior releases.

However the good news is that in addition to all 16 episodes from the 1978 season, we are treated to commentary on both the first and last episode of the set by DC writers Geoff Johns and Mark Waid.  There is also a nice little retrospective called Saturday: Sleeping bags and Superfriends.  While this could have easily been a three disc set, WB decided to instead make the second disc dual-sided to fit the final two episodes and final commentary pieces.

Included on this set are the following episodes:

1 Wanted: The Superfriends
2 Invasion of The Fearians
3 The World's Deadliest Game
4 The Time Trap
5 Trial of the Superfriends
6 Monolith of Evil
7 The Giants of Doom
8 Secret Origins of the Superfriends
9 Revenge on Gorilla City
10 Swamp of the Living Dead
11 Conquerors of the Future
12 The Final Challenge
13 Fairy Tale of Doom
14 Doomsday
15 Superfriends, Rest in Peace
16 The History of Doom",1201132800,8,2551,4.807780320366133

2057970,5,B00023E88U,"I never grew up watching the Superfriends as most of the reviewers have. I do remember catching it in re-runs on weekday afternoons...usually at 3:30...so i never caught it on the Saturday morning line-up. I had always liked the shows...i liked all the versions of SUPERFRIENDS that i have been able to see through the years. The one that sticks out by far is CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS. As one reviewer put it, the villains and their over-the-top zeal at everything they do, make the show even more enjoyable. Another thing i like is the narration by Bill Woodson...his voice is heard in every episode as the narrator plus in several episodes, specifically FAIRYTALES OF DOOM on DVD #2, Woodson gives voice to Captain Nemo. That scene takes place inside the book 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Toyman had created a device that inserted people into fairytales and the Superfriends only had a certain amount of time before they become permanent characters inside the fairytales: Jack and the Beanstalk {Hawkman}, Gulliver's Travels {Superman}, and Alice in Wonderland {Wonder Woman}. I love the episode REVENGE ON GORILLA CITY and i also like THE SECRET ORIGINS OF THE SUPERFRIENDS, THE TIME TRAP, INVASION OF THE FEARIANS, and SWAMP OF THE LIVING DEAD. I do however want to clear up something about Flash. Several have noted that he flies...well, in my eyes, he isn't ""flying"" as Superman would...Flash i think creates enough super-energy to lift himself into the air...especially on the episode when  the Fearians and the Legion of Doom trick the Superfriends into changing the atmosphere of the Earth to make it like Venus. In that episode, Captain Cold goes on a freezing spree...Flash defrosts all of the cities which causes the air to become smoggy. In another episode, dealing with an invention called Liquid Light, Bizarro {the backwards version of Superman} dumps it out and it begins to devour everything in it's path. Flash circles around at high speed and it acts as a vaccum and sucks the Liquid Light up and it falls back to the earth ""in the form of harmless falling stars"" as narrator Bill Woodson explains. Green Lantern's power ring, i think, enables Aquaman and the others to appear to be ""flying""...especially in the episode called GIANTS OF DOOM where Captain Cold freezes the regular-size Superfriends and Toyman ""airmails"" the Superfriends to the planet, Saturn. In that episode, it frequently shows Aquaman up in the air with the rest of them...flying...as with Flash and the others. I liked all of the episodes and i give the entire collection 5 stars. As far as the animation goes, i am aware of the mistakes. There are several...i can't make any excuses for it beyond saying whoever looked over the final cuts before they were aired on Television didn't pay close attention to detail. Outside of those errors that have been talked about, everything else about this series is great. This collection is billed as the First Season but it's the ONLY season...so any newcomers to all things Superfriends, do not look forward to a second season of CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS because there won't be one. Another thing about the animation before i conclude the review...this is 1978 animation...i know how superior and technically advanced animation has become since 1978 so there's no comparison...but the lack of superior animation shouldn't dictate what one would watch...at least for me it doesn't.",1177200000,,3425,4.998248686514886
2057971,3,B00023E88U,"I get upset with people who slam these collections on the basis of comparing them to today's standards.  There is no debate that Justice League and the Unlimited incarnations of these characters are simply wonderful examples of how we've advanced as a culture in the past 30 years.

That said, I have to admit that going back in time through this little collection (4 episodes) while nostalgic, certainly does reveal many of the limitations of 1978 animation.  Most notable are the overly simplistic storylines that require thorough narration of what is clearly taking place on screen.  Next, after the viewer is brought ""up to speed"" by the narration itself, we are then treated to another set of explanations usually from the villain at hand who audible hatches his scheme to the rest of the Legion of Doom.

The other major flaw in the Superfriends (aside from the standard Hanna Barbara sound effect library shared with Scooby-Doo, The Flintstones, and Captain Caveman to name a few) is the lack of character depth.  The unfortunate reality is that all of the members of the Justice League of America are basically cardboard cutouts.  There is almost no discernable personality between heroes other than their abilities which are often cheaply used for resolve.

Oh well, it's all in good fun and there is no denying that this is the closest thing to real-life time travel we have.  Slipping in the Challenge of the Superfriends simply begs its viewer to get into their pajamas and pour themself a tall bowl of sugary cereal.",1176768000,3,1529,4.895348837209302

It is however, the season that was called CHALLENGE OF THE SUPER FRIENDS. And it is complete in its original running order. The real first season of THE SUPER FRIENDS featured Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog. Remember them? For those reviewers that lambasted this show in comparison to JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED,(which in fact are awesome shows) that's a very unfair assessment. Not only was the budget limited so was the general additude of the animation industry at that time. Remember these were cartoons, and ""cartoons"" were geared to small children on Saturday Mornings. Back then 12 year old boys were expected to mow lawns and rake leaves not sit around watching tv. But now with the advent of DVDS giving us back the Satudays Mornings we lost, we expect the production values to be low, but the fun invaluable. Sometimes simple animation with cut and dried stories of good vs evil is what we need to get us through the rough times in our lives, no matter how old we are.",1172966400,12,1128,4.760204081632653
2057973,4,B00023E88U,"I remember growing up as a child, sitting in front of the television on Saturday mornings watching these cartoons. I loved it back then and I still do now! The electrifying musical score under the supervision of Paul DeKorte and the direction of Hoyt Curtin prepared you for what was about to take place, as well as the narration voice-over from Stanley Jones. It was an amazing feat to gather 13 villians to go up against the Super Friends! I think William Hanna and Joseph Barbera did well and the show really reflected the time, which was 1978. Yes, there are a few blunders in the animation, but the scripts are well-written, although you will find that some of the dialogue, again reflected the time in which it was made. All in all, it is a very good show.
My favourite episodes are "" The Time Trap, The Monolith Of Evil, Secret Origins Of The Super Friends, Swamp Of The Living Dead, Fairy Tales Of Doom, Super Friends: Rest In Peace and History Of Doom.""
The transfers and the audio are quite good for the time and the age(1978) of the prints, although Warner Brothers should have done some restoration work on this collection. The audio should at least be in 2.0, but they gave us 1.0 with this collection. The special features are good, espically ""Saturday, Sleeping Bags & Super Friends: A Retrospective.""

Each week the Super Friends battled the Legion of Doom and tried to protect the world from evil. This show is pure entertainment for the whole family. The DVD picture and sound are really good but the video does suffer from age related issues and debris but not enough to detract from the overall viewing experience. This show contains some of the greatest Super Heroes and memorable Villains DC Comics has to offer. After all these years the Super Friends message is still evident, good conquers evil and truth, honesty and justice are standards to live by. Some very nice special features are included in this set and I found them interesting to watch. Even though I'm much older now, I still enjoy the opening theme song and characters from this show. They just don't make them like this anymore, five stars all the way!

2057977,5,B00023E88U,"This amazing DVD box set is a time machine. It will instantly place any viewer over the age of about 30 back in front of their TV set on Saturday morning chowing down on the Crunchberries in their pyjamas out in the living room, absolutely rivited to whatever cushion or bean bag they had at their disposal as the fate of the whole world would be battled over week after week. This is hand-drawn animation for TV at it's attention deficit disordered best, with fantastic color that provides instant wish-fulfillment for any other grown up 11 year old who like myself was forced to grow up with the cruelty of black & white TV as some obligatory punishment for an offense that was never quite understood. All the cool kids had color, we had B&W, but you know, I think we maybe enjoyed it a bit more because we had to use our imaginations to color what we were seeing in grayscales.

The original Superfriends were great of course, and as a classmate from grad school pointed out to me once, one of the important things about the show is that these super heroes were FRIENDS before all else. Yes they worked together to fight crime and protect the American consumer culture which spawned them, but they cared about each other just like the rest of us care about our friends & family. It made them more human, and even apprentice super heroes Marvin, Wendy (one of my earliest crushes) along with the annoying Wonder Dog and later Gleek the Super Chimp always came across as actual people. With ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" the core Justic League outfit was expanded with the addition of several other DC Comics heroes. There were even ethnic super heroes added for cross-cultural appeal, all of them incorruptable, honest, modest and totally devoted to upholding justice.

BUT THE REAL STARS OF THE SHOW WERE THE VILLAINS!! and that's where this particular 16 episode series really outshined all other incarnations of The Superfriends. Without a good villain super heroes can be kind of boring, even silly, and this series' creators were well aware that while we may have been rooting for The Flash & Green Lantern, the real reason we kept tuning in week after week was because of the fantastic array of super villains they populated this series with: Black Manta and Solomon Grundy were always my favorites. They had a Dark Side mentality to them that allowed the kids watching to actually precieve a threat that required Superman or Wonder Woman to intervene on the behalf of mankind lest our whole planet be doomed.

Super villains also require super plots at global domination to make them memorable, and this show had plots to set the world on fire, send it back or forwards into time, enemy invaders from the cosmos who were indifferent to the meek, humble ordinary humans populating the planet. No nation was safe from the chicanery of The Riddler or Captain Cold either -- the Russians, Chinese and Arabian nations were just as likely to be clobbered by some super plot as the USA, linking those of us on the world together in needing to oppose tyranny from wherever it came. The USSR may have been bad news but they weren't as bad as the Legion of Doom.

Gone are the days of hand-drawn animated cartoons of this nature, and this DVD set is a treasure trove of material that continues to look fresh and exciting when placed next to the computer rendered animation of today. Sure some of it was goofy, the repetitive, over-excited music gets kind of routine after a while, and some of the plots border on the ridiculous: Trapping the Superfriends in the classics of literature anyone? It may have been clumsy but ultimately that episode might have encouraged young viewers to read the books in question, so in the end you wound up learning something even if it wasn't as cool as ""Swamp of the Living Dead"" or ""Revenge on Gorilla City"".

I simply cannot recommend this box set enough: Any kid will be delighted and any parent will be oddly compelled to go out and find a box of Quisp or Freakies to wolf down. Just remember to get an extra box of cereal for the kids too, since traditions are best handed down from generation to generation intact.",1156032000,6,4155,4.655313351498638

2057980,4,B00023E88U,"Get ready to experience again the ultimate battle of good versus evil in the classic animated comic book series ""Challenge of the Super Friends - The First Season"". From their secretive swamp-based headquarters, the Hall of Doom, thirteen of the most sinister super villains have banded together for a single objective: intergalactic conquest. Now, the fate of the entire universe rests in the hands of the eleven powerful members of the Justice League of America. Based on the popular DC Comics' superheroes, ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" was one of the early ""Super Friends"" cartoons produced by the creative team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in the mid 1970s. The Saturday morning favorite premiered on ABC in 1978. ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" featured a colorful roster of heroes and villains and old-fashioned comic book adventure. The 1978 version ranks as one of the most memorable of the ""Super Friends"" cartoons due to its simple ""Heroes versus Villains"" storylines and no goofy junior sidekicks. Though the stories, characters and animation are pretty straightforward, the half-hour animated series does offer some decent amusement.

If you grew up watching the TV show as a kid, then ""Challenge of the Super Friends - The First Season"" will truly impress you. All 16 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains a fine-looking video transfer and a fair Dolby Digital sound. Its special features include two audio commentaries on selected episodes, character biographies, the 14-minute ""Saturday, Sleeping Bags & Super Friends: A Retrospective"" featurette and promos of other Warner animated titles.

2057988,5,B00023E88U,I loved this show as a kid and I still love it! I've had a wonderful time watching these episodes. This is a nicely designed package too and I enjoyed the extras. It's great having the Challenge of the Super Friends on DVD!,1104710400,2,223,4.209302325581396
2057989,5,B00023E88U,"I asked for this DVD for Christmas because I thought it would be fun to watch all these episodes again - I was always GLUED to the TV every Saturday morning to watch the Super Friends throughout most of the 70's.  It has been a blast watching these episodes and I'm amazed how many of them I actually remember once they get started.  The animation is classic 70's and it's fun to catch animation blunders such as Batman talking without his Utility belt on and then the next few seconds when the camera is back on him, he has it on!  Also hilarious is the Justice League computer that prints out information instead of talking, and some crazy plot points such as the Super Friends always catch up with the Legion of Doom, but can never find their headquarters!?!

By the way, the Legion of Doom are the bomb!!  They are so kooky and fun!

I have enjoyed every minute of watching these episodes... they are so corny now-a-days that I simply laugh all the way through them, and it's been great re-living my childhood again!",1104364800,5,1020,4.456989247311828
2057990,5,B00023E88U,"Oh, the memories: of watching these on Saturday mornings; of racing home after the last school bell so I could catch reruns in the 80's; and of the pure joy of seeing so many heroes and villains that I had heard of, all in one show. Cheesy? Predictable? Sure, but I loved it!

The older I get, the more I appreciate how good those of us who grew up in the 80's had it. Today's cartoons can't hold a candle to the characters and stories like you find in The Challenge of the Super Friends. Sure, the animation may be tons better today, but it takes lots more than good animation to make up a good 30 minute show.

The extras on this DVD box set were great too. The commentary was cool. It was cool hearing comic book writers relive and talk about things I had seen and remember in episodes. The hero and villain bios were too short in my opinion, but the sound bites and music leading up to the voiceovers which were included, helped balance these short comings.

The only disappointment I have with this series is that it didn't last longer. Oh well, it just makes the Super Friends seem all the more unique, and desirable. Personally, The Challenge of the Super Friends was, and still is, my favorite version of the Super Friends. All in all, a great box set that every fan, whether remote or passionate, of the Super Friends should have, especially if you remember the ""good old days.""",1104019200,2,1387,4.389105058365759

As compared to the current Justice League Unlimited, it is more realistic and Superman do get hurt with powerful laser beams or forces and this makes the show more exciting.

2057992,5,B00023E88U,"Challenge of the Super Friends - The First Season is a must-have DVD set for any fan of DC Comics' most memorable and exciting Saturday morning cartoon series ever created. Even if you're not a fan and are just looking for a fantastic adventure, I would encourage you to check this out.

Back when Saturday morning cartoons were geared only towards toddlers, along came this ""adult-themed"" science-fiction and fantasy adventure for the ""older"" crowd. Pushing the boundries of science, imagination and characterization, Challenge of the Super-Friends introduced real drama, conflict, heroism and horror into one fine cartoon series.

This is a classic tale about good versus evil. The Super Friends (consisting of Aquaman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, The Flash, Hawkman, Apache Chief, Black Vulcan and Samurai) face off against a team of villianous foes calling themselves the Legion of Doom (Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Gorilla Grodd, Giganta, Black Manta, Sinestro, Solomon Grundy, Scarecrow, Cheetah, the Riddler, Bizarro, Captain Cold and Toyman). In each episode, the evil Legion of Doom hatches a horrific plan, and in each episode the Super Friends fight to stop them.

Although originally produced as a Saturday morning cartoon, this series boasts two very distinguishable attributes:

The first is that of incredible characterization. Each hero and villain has his or hew own unique look, personality and voice characteristics. In fact, the voice-over work done on this series is the best ensemble voice work ever done on a series of this magnitude. Indeed, no one can argue that the the voice of Black Manta is not the creepiest in cartoon history.

Second, the stories may be geared towards youngsters and teens, but there are elements in them that take it well above ""kiddie-fare"". There is an inherent quality of gothic horror in most of the tales (marauding zombies/attacking gorillas/evil swamp hags) that take this series up to a higher standard in cartoon story-telling.

The DVD also contains extras, such as commentary by current DC Comics writers. In addition, you haven't lived until you watch Challenge of the Super Friends dubbed in Spanish! (Just listen to them dub Black Manta's voice through what sounds like a tin can!)

Bottom-line: If you watched this series as a kid, you're already hooked. If you haven't watched this as a kid, then watch it now. This is a guaranteed winner!",1094342400,14,2425,5.202564102564103
2057993,5,B00023E88U,"I love Batman and the Superfriends.  I can still remember watching this cartoon on Saturday mornings and after school back in the seventies and early eighties.  I still watch it every so often on Boomerang.  Watching these cartoons has brought back some very fond memories.

I am so glad that this is all on one set so I do not have to have lots of individual videos with four or five episodes on each.

If you liked the series and you like watching the shows over again then you will be super happy with this set. The picture is great, I liked the stories and this is the series that featured Lex Luthor and the Legion of Doom- no Marvin and Wendy.

Boomerang is always showing the Marvin and Wendy or Supertwin episodes and lately they have shown the newest Superfriends episodes.  Now I do not have to wait for them to  to get around to showing the Legion of Doom shows.  I have then in my hand to watch any time.",1093737600,3,916,4.27906976744186
2057994,5,B00023E88U,"...the world's greatest super heroes unite to keep a watchful eye on the planet earth.'  And it's so cool to be able to be back with the Super Friends once again!  Kudos to the creators of this once-in-a-lifetime and unprecedented Saturday morning series event that is certain never to be equaled again.  Because of complex licensing issues producing a similar show on television today with all the same characters would be utterly impossible.  And so a reunion of the 'World's Greatest Superheroes' is sadly unlikely as well.

Well, if you've seen even one episode of ""The Challenge Of The Super Friends"" you know it's no Hall Of Fame animated classic - at least not as far as the continuity is concerned.  There are some very grievous errors that are hilarious to spot.  For instance in the episode ""The Time Trap"" three sets of the Super Friends get trapped in various eras of earth's past, among them Batman & Robin who are captured and held by the troops of one of the Roman emperor Caesars.  In the present day Superman discovers a clue that can pinpoint the time frames each of the set of heroes is being held so off he goes to the lab to have the piece of evidence analyzed; and who should be there amongst the other Super Friends waiting for the analysis - none other than Batman himself!  Maybe he was just there in spirit and only we (the fans in Saturday morning TV land) could see him?  Another sparkling moment comes in the episode ""The Monolith Of Evil"" when suddenly Green Lantern has three arms - I can't tell if he has more than one power ring.  Other blunders that happened periodically were Hawkman missing his wings; the inversion of colors and/or direction of logos on the uniforms of Batman & Robin; Green Lantern's power ring would emanate a yellow (!) glow instead of green and, best of all, the Flash would go flying off (!!) with Superman and Hawkman whenever it was convenient to the plot.  The Flash had no capability of flying in any of his comic book appearances that I can remember - and you'd think the creative staff behind the show would be aware of that.  But these are all forgivable mistakes to the fans of the series because it's the strong points of the show that make it the classic that is revered by fans still to this day.

The positives of this program are many beginning with the vibrant theme music; heroic and majestic sounding it is reminiscent of the theme for the classic early 60's animated cult favorite 'Johnny Quest'.  It certainly wouldn't surprise anyone to discover that this quite probably was the inspiration behind it.  The idea of 'The Legion Of Doom' is a great concept that is still unsurpassed.  Scavenging back through the vaults and archives of DC Comics to get the right mix of villains must have been daunting at the time and not as easy to piece together as it appears when seeing the show.  There were literally tons of adversaries, antagonists and nemesis's to choose from and creating a balance - that is a viable and believably powerful enough force to challenge the Super Friends - wasn't something that just jumped out at you I'm sure.  Seeing such archenemies as Sinestro, Gorilla Grod and Gigantress in television animated form is a rare treat that is doubtful to happen ever again.  The headquarters for 'The Legion Of Doom' is equally as impressive.  They could go anywhere they pleased as a group; outer space, inner earth, backwards or forward in time, etc.  The Super Friends on the other hand all have their own separate forms of transportation - and the Hall Of Justice is anchored to the ground permanently.  While the stories are unquestionably juvenile in conception some of them still remain quite entertaining.  My favorites are ""Fairy Tales Of Doom"" and especially ""History Of Doom"", and the episode ""Secret Origins Of The Super Friends"" is also memorable.  There are other positives about this show I could list but they are already mentioned in other reviews here on this webpage so I encourage you to read them also.

The DVD set is nicely packaged and has an excellent 13 minute mini-documentary titled 'Saturday, Sleeping Bags & Super Friends: A Retrospective' that I think every fan will be pleased with.  Also included are bios on each of the Super Friends and also the members that make up 'The Legion Of Doom' that I found indispensable.  If I had one quibble at all it would be the title of the set ""The Challenge Of The Super Friends: The First Season"" - was there ever a second season?",1092787200,28,4488,4.653992395437262
2057995,4,B00023E88U,"After 25 years, Challenge of the Super Friends is finally released on DVD! Saturday morning viewers may or may not recall Hanna Barbara, the creators of Scooby Doo and Yogi Bear, brought the Silver Age of DC Comics more popular exposure with their earlier version of the Super Friends saving the world from catastrophe. They had Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and the Dynamic Duo with Wendy, Marvin, Wonder Dog, the Wonder Twins, and Gleek?! But after those campier seasons, DC Comics may have talked privately with H.B. to make the series more accurate to DC's storylines. Therefore, H.B. came up with JLA's archrivals, The Legion of Doom, in a 16 episode clash of good v.s evil warfare. ""Holy turf wars Batman!"" Yes those one liners were cliche and silly. But some of those episodes had some shocking moments.

Wanted: The Super Friends - Lex Luthor uses a dream machine to make the Justice League commit crimes.

(My personal favorite) Super Friends: R.I.P. - the Justice League pay their final respects to their fallen comrade Batman.

Some of the Silver Age heroes were different from today's Justice League series. Barry Allen was the Flash. Today his nephew Wally West is the current Flash. Hal Jordan was the Green Lantern. Now it's John Stewart. (In the comics, Hal Jordan is likely to return as Green Lantern again.)

And I was really surprised this series inspired today's comic-book artists and writers. This series was meant for those who are from the 70's and watching the current series still brings back those Saturday morning moments.",1092441600,13,1553,4.938697318007663

With ""first season"" in this title, it does imply subsequent season of the show. Anyhow this DVD edition is enjoyable with welcomed and somewhat amusing commentary in two of the episodes. If I had any negative to express it would be that I wish the bios of both the heros and villians were more detailed. For example, where did Sinestro come from, why did he have a fallout with the Guardians of Oa, where did he get his power ring, what/where is Qward, etc?

The plots for these shows were soo intellectual...no wonder we children from the late 70s-early 80s turned out so well.  I wouldn't be caught dead watching the dribble/fluff they have for cartoons now.  Even twenty years later, the Superfriends are still standing the test of time.

Now, if they will just release the rest of the Superfriends cartoon catalog on DVD, I will be grateful (even though I hate the Wonder Twins!! LOL)!!",1089763200,4,945,4.713414634146342

Glad it worked out. Now I can move the stars from a 3 to at least a 4.

Hope this helps.",1503360000,,324,3.953846153846154

8021263,4,B00023E88U,Blast from the Past! The shows have been fun to watch again all these years later. My only complaint is with the disc case.
