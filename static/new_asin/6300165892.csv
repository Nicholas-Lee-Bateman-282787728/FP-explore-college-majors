I couldn't stop laughing. The writing, acting, and cinematography is horrible. There were better actors in my Jr. High drama class.  From smoking hand grenades that take two minutes to go off, explosions that launch 20 men through the sky, and one liners that put all others to shame, this is one of my favorites. Get your buddies together and laugh your heads off.",995846400,10,532,4.659574468085107
211184,5,6300165892,"This IS the best movie ever made. With BREATHTAKING action and documentary scenes from NAM this film is going to take your breath away. I can also identify myself with the hero, Michael Ransom, his performance as an actor  is astonishing.",948931200,5,238,4.804878048780488
7803480,3,6300165892,I should edit this down. Strike Commando WAS CERTAINLY A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. I had a spelling fit there. I'm better now. This movie made scream JAKODAAA!! and AMERICANSKI alot. I wish they explored the realtionship between JAKODAAA!!! and Ogle more. Are they a couple? What's one of their dates like? Do they go to Shakey's Pizza? GARLIC BEARD! Is that enough? Sure.,1513382400,,368,4.951612903225806

7803482,4,6300165892,It's a pretty good movie if you're just looking to kill some time. Pretty long a drawn out but lots of action throughout.,1510876800,,121,4.304347826086956
7803483,5,6300165892,"Likable Reb Brown plays Mike Ransom, an elite soldier during the Vietnam War.  He is best known for his work in the one of the greatest war movies ever made, Uncommon Valor.  Another old time favorite playing the colonel is the late great Christopher Connelly.",1506124800,,260,4.7555555555555555
7803484,1,6300165892,This movie is about the worst movie I have ever seen. A poor take off on Rambo which is obvious a real d movie. Bad acting and very unrealistic. I was in Viet Nam and nothing in this movie is realistic.,1505606400,,202,3.951219512195122
7803485,5,6300165892,"My faith in humanity is restored by the fact that everyone who sees this unanimously agrees it is a great movie. Reb Brown reminds us of a better America where the popcorn grows on trees, the only good Russkie is a dead one and the Vietnam war never really ended and just kind of switched over to the Philippines for most of the 80s. If this movie doesn't make you want to unleash a testosterone packed scream while shooting walls and trees randomly then check your pulse.",1504569600,,472,4.436781609195402

7803487,5,6300165892,"I don't really care what kind of moviegoer you are, you need to see this film.  This film is probably the greatest thing ever filmed by ""Vincent Dawn"" (not his real name.)",1372896000,,171,4.34375
7803488,5,6300165892,"Oh man, this movie will make you a fan of Reb Brown.  It's a rip-off of Rambo mainly, but incorporates a couple other movies as well (including, but not limited to: The Terminator, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome; interested yet?).  I mean, just look at the cover!  The gun in the cover isn't in the movie (though I would loved to have seen that), probably due to it being low budget and using stock footage at brief moments, but it sets the picture for just how over the top (unintentionally) hilarious this movie is.

To sum up the plot, Reb gets wounded and recovers behind enemy lines in Vietnam, tries to help a Vietnamese village out, but finds out Russians are killing people too, so he gets out of Vietnam for debriefing, returns alone under the same plot-line as Rambo 2, finds the Vietnamese village massacred, gets captured by the Russians, eventually brakes free, has a bunch of shootouts and one of the goofiest fights I've ever seen in my life with the big macho Russian guy (who looks like a regular American guy trying to make some sort of accent), and ends it with the way Rambo 2 should have ended, shooting up both the place and the guy who backstabbed him twice in the movie.  And if you didn't think you saw enough goofiness, over-the-top acting and moments (and Reb Brown screaming) at that point, he has one last fight afterwards (which I won't spoil, but it's got to be the greatest ending moment I've ever seen in a movie like this).

Highlights include Reb's yelling (of course), the cheesy acting, the Disneyland death speech (impossible not to laugh hearing that), more Reb Brown yelling, the fight with the Russian, and the last and 2nd to the last explosion in the movie.

Bottom line, you have to see this movie.  I've never seen a movie this bad that was this entertaining in my life, and I've seen Plan 9 From Outer Space.

On a personal note, when I purchased this movie supposedly brand new from a seller on this site, it ended up being used and was missing a small amount of footage from the beginning.  Be careful who you buy this from.",1296345600,2,2068,4.505347593582887
7803489,5,6300165892,"Directed by the amazing ""King of cheese"" Bruno Mattei, using he name Vincent Dawn for this project. Brings you Part one of two part series called ""Strike Commando"". This is an amazing movie about a strike commando (Reb Brown), is no ordinary soldier... he's the best, most highly trained war machine in Vietnam and nothing can stop him!

While on a mission he gets caught be hind enemy lines and discovers a deadly platoon led by Russian sadists. He escapes from the savages only to be thrown right back in again for another suicide mission, objective being to document the Russians involvement and liberate the Vietnamese who who saved his life.

From Italian film maker Bruno Mattei brings you this instant classic, which one day i hope will get a DVD release... full of hilarious acting, awful dialog, and tons of stock footage that makes this the most amazing Rambo: First Blood part 2 rip-ff to ever be made! Also because of this films wonderful success, Bruno Mattei made 'Strike Commando"" part 2!",1194393600,3,1003,4.791907514450867
