Take it from a mother of 2 children, this is the best investment to help your kids hang on to their =heritage and become more inquisitive about their culture.",1020470400,2,281,4.64
7794263,5,0970738307,"This is a very high-quality video, much better than I expected. The characters look like Muppets, and the singing and the teaching is well done. While the focus is on learning the alphabet, the program works hard to introduce viewers to important aspects of Ukrainian culture (dancing, geography, famous Ukrainians, etc.) It kept my attention even as an adult, so I'm sure that children will want to watch Boomchyk and friends over and over again.  Recommended!",1010016000,4,461,5.065789473684211
