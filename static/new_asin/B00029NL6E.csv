The story lines were great and helped explain the fruits of the spirits on my 6 and 8 year old level. I could really tell that my 8 year old would had rather this been animated. As well as myself because I love cartoons that have an Christian meaning! Thanks for shipping to APO!!!",1198886400,2,410,4.074074074074074
