5731364,4,B00CO75N7C,"This film was totally unexpected -- from the beginning to the end.  I liked that the viewpoint came from the boy's perspective and narration.  It intertained you in many ways, and gave us some reminders of the struggle we deal with growing up.  We can dream, but fairytales usually don't come true.  The fact that it was in French didn't bother me at all; the English subtitles were fine.",1379894400,25,388,4.579710144927536

5731369,1,B00CO75N7C,"Sorry, but I'm amazed at the reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I admit that the English subtitles probably didn't help in the dialogue, but it was stilted to say the least. The acting was horrible and I am still trying to figure out what the message of the movie was. I usually like foreign films because they are not ""Hollywood"", but this one just didn't cut it. I forced myself to watch to the end hoping to find some redeeming ending, but alas, there was nothing. Save your money on this one.",1448323200,2,527,4.227722772277228

5731371,5,B00CO75N7C,This was a pretty good movie. I had seen it on a foreign channel a while ago and decided after coming across it that I wanted it. Its a good rainy  day film.,1446681600,2,157,3.757575757575758

8583881,5,B00CO75N7C,"Cyanure (or Cyanide?) is a chilling story of child neglect and the damage it could cause. The boy had a hard roll to play, but pulled it off extraordinarily well. Even though it is English subtitled the viewer doesn't need to read the dialog to understand the story. It is clear just from the video what is going on.",1470528000,6,316,4.372881355932203
