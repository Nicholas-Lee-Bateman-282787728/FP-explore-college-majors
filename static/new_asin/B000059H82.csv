7933199,2,B000059H82,"TRAITOR'S HEART has an unexpected haunting opening sequence in which slomo soldiers and helicopter run through the landscape accompanied by a soprano's operatic vocals.  It's such an antithesis to the violence going on around it, it's hauntingly beautiful.  After that, though, it's all downhill.  In an over the top let's eat ham performance, Bryan Genesse plays an amnesiac who can't remember his past five years.  What happened to him?  Shady governmental conspiracies arise and Genesse finds out he's one of four special ops agents who is targeted for elimination.  Lovely wife Kimberley Kates may even be in on it?  And what about his dad?  As one reviewer noted, the final courtoom scene is so ridiculous, it's laughable.  Also what happens between Genesse and the dastardly Mahoney is so veiled, we never fully understand just what did happen.  And why does the last man come to kill Genesse?  Who is he?  Does anyone even care by this point?  A shame since it had such a promising opening, but Genesse joins Stallone in the hunks who can't act category, but he will never be as famous, that's for sure.",1111449600,,1110,4.871657754010696
7933200,1,B000059H82,"when this movie came on my cable server, i looked it up on amazon to see what was up. when i saw that it had not been reviewed, i decided to watch it, to see if i could help. ...this picture is not even bad enough to be good. it's just not good.
an ex-government 'highly-trained killer' (you were the best of the worst, son) has his memory tampered with by his ex-commanders, but starts getting it back by dint of several implausable occurences. the action sequences that follow are unconvincing, unbelievable, and derivative. the acting is, well, i'm sorry, but words fail me here. the father 'fessing up, any scene in which the son, sean, appears ...
i mean, i really like court-room scenes, but these court-room scenes are just awful, so manipulated as to be simply ludicrous (how many times can a judge say, 'this is turning into a circus'? i believe that this movie holds the world record for this banality catagory).
is there anything redeeming here? yes. the female lead, kimberly kates, enchanted me (the male lead is presumably a 'hunk', but that's not my department). i even thought that she delivered her impossibly hackneyed lines with verve and flair, but as i mentioned, i may have been enchanted.  she did enchant me. let's hope that she gets many more roles, because i want to see her again, but maybe not at the cost of sitting through this turkey again (but i will if i have to, as i said, she enchanted me)
in short, this is not a movie to avoid, it is just a movie to ignore.",1044576000,3,1495,4.476190476190476
