7921254,3,B00004RF6O,"I really wanted to like this! It started out good; boy, rescues girl & being a gentleman(not many guys are these days)takes her in and tries to help her.  The plot/story picks up from there & he meets other characters who help him.  Watch it yourself.  You just might be suprised! The only ""gripe"" I have with this; is the producers/directors, or whoever made this, stopped short & didn't make a sequel.  This could have been a great RPG anime like Record of Lodoss War, the 1977 animated The Hobbit, etc. If I had millions, like MOST stooges in Hollywood, I would make sequels of animes like this one that never got a continuation!",1511049600,,632,4.517543859649122
7921255,2,B00004RF6O,"I read the back of this video and picked it up, because it appealed to me.  A special girl?  A hero?  However, I felt disappointed, as if the story was incomplete.  It wasn't as though I was unsatisfied with the story itself, but so much more could have been done with this and it seemed as though the writers simply stopped midway.

The characters have potential and this story could have been made into a sequal.  Otherwise, I wouldn't bother buying this--too pointless.",1122076800,,472,4.626506024096385
7921256,5,B00004RF6O,"True, this is a little cheesy, but it is very nice, and the lines are very memorable.  I have watched this thing about 30 times, and I am starting to know the lines in certain scenes verbatim. This is the perfect cult movie.",1046131200,2,224,4.209302325581396
7921257,4,B00004RF6O,"I watched this last night, and found it to be a really fun anime to watch. I really liked the story and the characters. The animation was good as well.
I found out this morning that they didn't make any sequels to it. Thats unfortunate. The story was just getting started!",1037836800,,272,4.352941176470588
7921258,3,B00004RF6O,"A critic named Pauline Kael has once said that there are such things as good trash and bad trash when it comes to movies. Her theory could certainly be proven under ""Dragoon"", an anime so goofy that since then NO SEQUEL's been made to follow up with it, even though the story is not yet completed. From the dubbing to the animation, nothing is pitch perfect, but it could be worth a chuckle or two, and it makes for great fanfiction material.
""Dragoon's"" story is one of the oldest stories of all time. Basically, Sedon, a young man with an aging father, must now carry on his father's skill and courage to survive the future. That future arrives to him in the form of a lost and beautiful woman, who doesn't remember that she is part of an evil plan, and therefore many villains want her. Along the way, the young man must protect the woman through his healer sister, a lance-wielding prince named Lain, a fiery beaut named Lilith and her trusty knife-wielding assistant.
That's about where the differences end. The animation is corny, nothing as skillful compared to Digimon or anything from Clamp. But there's a ton of nudity included in this one. The shiest character, the woman May, has a nude scene almost every 10 minutes!!! If that doesn't get your noodle nutty, read this; Sedon's sister and Lilith also bare their bums too. This is a guilty-pleasure anime that's just ambrosia to anime nerds who dig naked women in a medieval setting.
You want violence? There is some, especially some graphic explosions and swordplay with blood shooting everywhere. But it's very tame compared to the nudity, which no doubt is the explanation for the anime's +17 rating.
The characters can be good for some, bad for others. Let me explain. The characters have hardly a mite for any development. They are often involved in predictable situations (e.g., sibling rivalry, uneasy inheritance of power) that you've seen before not just in anime, but in ""Dawson's Creek"". My favorite characters are Lilith, Sedon's sister and Lain. I couldn't gather much info, but I think Lain and Sedon's sister make quite a couple. I wouldn't mind Sedon and Lilith, but I have no idea who May really is. She's not a character, just a plot point that will have men leering at her from all angles.
Maybe you folks could spare a view of ""Dragoon"", but if you really like it, be warned; there's no sequel made for this story. Then again, why don't you conjure your own sequel? That way, you could imagine all the nudity that you want.",1022025600,,2504,4.680272108843537
7921259,4,B00004RF6O,"To all those who seem put off by the nudity in Dragoon I suggest you read an article in the Fall issue of Anime Invasion. To the question of Why is there so much nudity(in anime) AI explains and I quote..""Quite simply, nudity isn't a big deal in Japan. It's merely a cultural difference. You might have noticed the same thing if you've visited Europe and watched TV. In America, naked bodies are naughty and kept hidden away, but in other parts of the world, thats just not so"" end quote. So for all you prudes out there complaining of nudity in Dragoon and other anime for that matter..GET OVER IT!
That said, I really liked Dragoon, it had all the makings of a good anime series: good drawing, damsel-in-distress with a shady past, well-meaning hero with potential, a burgoining love story, and side characters that were worth a damn, plus the omnipresent 'bad guy'..and ok, I admit..the nudity doenst hurt *smile*. I thought the series was very good and was way more interesting than Ray Earth which they seem to be making more titles of.  I really hope the studio comes to its senses and makes some sequels of it, but im not holding my breath.  All in all Dragoon wasn't the best anime, but it was far from the worst and worth continuing.  And by the way..if you thought the nudity in Dragoon was distasteful..rent Urotsukidoji sometime, or the La Blue Girl series and then see whatha think!  :) - A.N.",998265600,3,1406,4.545454545454546
7921260,4,B00004RF6O,"Dragoon starts off with a swordsman named Sadie training in the woods. As he hides from approaching Imperial soldiers, he spots a naked girl in the snow. He takes her to his cabin, finds out that her name is Miu and that she's lost her memory, and Sadie decides to protect her and find out why the Empire is after her. It's a pretty standard plot, but accompanied by decent characters and a considerable amount of nudity (which is a plus in my book). You can't go wrong with a woman who spontaneously throws her clothes off to prove she wasn't cheating in a card game. What is interesting is that the party tends to avoid confrontation with Imperial soldiers whenever they can instead of engaging in an all-out battle with them. This makes the situation a bit more believable, and is something I really haven't seen in any other anime. The ending, or should I say non-ending, left me wanting another three parts to watch of this OAV series, but it doesn't look like there are any sequels in sight. The last fight scene, although somewhat unresolved, is done very well. Dragoon is not always spectacular, but it is never boring. I'd buy the sequel if it were made.",992908800,,1163,4.542857142857143
7921261,4,B00004RF6O,"The story line gets interesting and has funny parts...if you catch them. Some are real subtle or just so silly that you have to laugh. It is kinda cheesy but how can you not be when during a time period some of it is based on, they say some of that becoming a great sword fighter and to honor thy father or what not. At first I was getting sick of the nudity but you soon get desensitized to it if you watch a lot of anime. So it's no big deal. I like the storyline and it's a good sci-fi/fantasy anime. I'd recommend it if you like swords clashing with machinery!",970531200,,564,4.044642857142857
7921262,3,B00004RF6O,"I personally felt that it was a good film, but the storyline wasn't anything new.  A boy is practicing swordsmanship in the woods when he stumbles across a girl who can only remember her name.  He joins forces  with her on a quest to find out her past and to know why the Empire is  looking for her, and what sort of connections she has with  ""Dragoon"".",963619200,,353,4.208955223880597
