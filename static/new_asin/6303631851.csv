700273,1,6303631851,"This was supposed to be a charming caper reuniting star Hepburn and director Wyler.

Unfortunately, with a miscast leading man, (I love OToole, but Cary Grant he aint) this turned out to be quite a misfire. Theres absolutely no chemistry between the leads. It shows you that directors, no matter how revered, should know when to call it quits, and that stars, even of this caliber, when sensing they're in a stinker, invariably resort to the kind of overacting that simply cannot save such a misguided project. Half the picture takes place in a broom closet!  So unfunny and predictable that even the Paris locations don't help. And Hepburn, a fashion plate in her 50s heyday, seems to have lost her way in the 60s, and gleefully flaunts the most ludicrous get-ups of the excessive Op era, and sports the most unflattering make-up of her entire career. Only her most rabid fans will treasure this. Could the film have worked better with Twiggy in the lead? The mind truly reels...",1509840000,2,980,4.758823529411765

700275,4,6303631851,"There was a time when Audrey Hepburn was the talk of the town. The ton of talent packed in the small package was one that everyone enjoyed. Guys thought she was attractive and women thought she exuded class. She was all of those things and more and was in some of the greatest movies ever made. Like most actors not every movie was a mega success but even those she was in that didn't reach that level were made better by her being in them. Case in point HOW TO STEAL A MILLION.

Hepburn stars as Nicole, the daughter of master art forger Bonnet (Hugh Griffith), a man who sells his forgeries as real paintings but has this need to show them off as well. She warns him that theres no reason to do so any longer and that one day it will lead to trouble. Which of course it does.

Passing off a statue of Cellinis Venus his father forged years ago as the real thing it is now on display in a prestigious museum in Paris. With such a huge value for the piece it is insured and the insurance company is planning on sending an expert in to validate its authenticity. Once its discovered to be a fake all items sold in the past by her father will come into question. Not sure of what to do her answer comes one late night in their home.

Nicole comes downstairs in the dark to find a burglar in their home about to steal a replica her father made and showed to someone earlier that day. The burglar is Simon Dermott (Peter OToole) and his appearance provides Nicole with a solution to her problem. Rather than turn him in, she recruits him to use his skills to help her steal the statue and thus save her father from going to prison. What Nicole doesnt know is that Simon actually works as an investigator for a company that looks into forgeries who was sent to find out if her fathers latest painting was legit or not.

Playing along Simon and Nicole plot out the method to steal the statue, under heavy guard with tons of security measures in place. The heist itself becomes the focus of the rest of the film as well as the mutual yet slow boiling attraction between Nicole and Simon. This is what romantic comedies were like in their heyday during the sixties. Whether or not they succeed in their attempt to get the statue is questioned alongside the question of will these two finally admit their attraction to one another.

The movie is a fun romp for all involved. For Hepburn it allowed her to play the befuddled young woman that shed made a career around. Fresh from a short hiatus after MY FAIR LADY, this was a vehicle for her return. For OToole it gave him a chance to play something a little different than audiences had grown accustomed to having just come off the success of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, BECKET and LORD JIM. It was a comedic role that he plays with ease, turning in a performance that reminds fans of the classic Cary Grant.

This film reminded me of so many others from the time period, cloaked in the pop culture and clothing designs of the time that date it but don't ruin it in doing so. The interplay between the two leads as well as the funny performance by Griffith made this one a treat. The heist is perfectly timed so as to not take too short a time to enjoy and to add a bit of suspense waiting to see just how they will pull it off, the novice and the professional working side by side. Its a movie worth multiple viewings.

Twilight Time presents the film with a beautiful 1080p hi def print. Extras are interesting this time around as well including an isolated music track, audio commentary track with actor Eli Wallach who is also in the film and Catherine Wyler, the original theatrical trailer and AUDREY HEPBURN: THE FAIREST LADY a documentary that appeared on the Biography channel.",1505001600,,3719,4.373371924746744

700348,4,6303631851,"Film has always been interested in crime, but in 1955 the French film RIFIFI touched off the heist film genremovies in which a crime, usually a robbery, is detailed in a meticulous and suspenseful manner.  In the 1960s, Hollywood often mixed the genre with comedy and romance, and the result was a series of films like GAMBIT, THE PINK PANTHER, and TOPKAPI, to name but a few.  HOW TO STEAL A MILLION came along in 1966, which was pretty much the crest of the wave.

The story concerns French art collector and dealer Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffith), who secretly forges, promotes, and sells paintings attributed to master artists.  When he lends a famous work to a Paris museum for exhibition, he unexpectedly risks exposureand daughter Nicole (Audrey Hepburn) determines to steal it back.  She obtains the services of a thief, Simon Dermott (Peter OToole), who she caught trying to burgle her fathers collection.  But is Simon really what he seems to be?  And can they defeat the museums seemingly impenetrable security system?  We pretty much know the answers to these questions from the get go, but the players are so engaging it doesnt matter.  Were happy to go along for the ride.

MILLION has an extraordinary pedigree.  It was directed by William Wyler, photographed by Charles Lang, edited by Robert Swink, art designed by Alexandre Trauner, and scored by John Williams.  The cast included Audrey Hepburn, Peter OToole, Hugh Griffith, Eli Wallach, and Charles Boyer.  Between them, these artists had over one hundred Academy Award nominations and no fewer than sixteen wins in competitive, honorary, and humanitarian categories.  Surprisingly, however, this is not the film for which any of them will be specifically remembered over time.  They all did better work on better projects.  But that said, MILLION has something that even great masterpieces sometimes lack: a sort of charm that makes it possible to take pleasure in multiple viewings.

MILLION is a little uneven, the comedy is rather mild, the plot is looseand the whole thing requires considerable suspension of disbelief.  But Hepburn and OToole are beautiful people and make an engaging couple.  Hepburn plays Nicole as daffy, a little gawky, and prone to double-takes; OToole is cool, witty, and at his drop-dead-gorgeous best.  Griffith gives a notable turn as Charles Bonnet, Wallach is memorable as a neurotic art collector, and Boyer is always a pleasure.  The whole thing is light and frothy and fun, and the production staff keeps it going at a pleasant pace.  Recommended for the fun of it.

Bonnet hides his art studio through a secret passage accessed by his wardrobe in his bedroom where he forges paintings by great art masters and sells them to millionaires who have too much money. He claims he only cheats the millionaires. Some time ago, he forged a sculpture supposedly created in the early 16th century. When a curator and collector comes to his home to buy the sculpture, Bonnet, fearing his scheme will be found out, willingly loans the piece to France for exhibition in a prestigious gallery.

Enter Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) who appears to be trying to steal one of the Bonnet family's artworks on the night of the unveiling of the sculpture. Nicole, in bed at their house, didn't attend the opening, and confronts Simon with a gun. In probably the best scene of the film, she realizes he's not a hardened criminal, and becomes strangely attracted to the intruder. She even drives him back to his hotel, the Ritz in Paris, a rather odd place for an art thief. The next day after the opening, Bonnet signs some insurance documents which will lead to the sculpture being appraised by art experts. Bonnet and Nicole realize the work will be deemed a fake, and Bonnet's previous sales of artwork will probably be scrutinized. He will not only lose his art-faking operation, but most likely he will be arrested and put on trial for fraud.

Then Nicole dreams up a crazy scheme: she'll steal the sculpture before the art experts get their probing intellect onto the figure. She solicits none other than Simon, the ""art thief"", to help her. Their mission: to steal the sculpture, although essentially the artwork already belongs to Bonnet and Nicole. And they're off on their hair-brained plan. Simultaneously, Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), an American businessman and art collector, desires both the sculpture for his own collection and the affections of Hepburn. A strange mnage a quatre ensues between Hepburn, O'Toole, Wallach, and the sculpture. The first third of the film is setting up the premise and the plans, and the middle third is the actual lifting of the sculpture. In the third act, everything comes out into the open, mostly.

While the film is mostly fun, the characters are more like cartoonish caricatures than real people, except for Hepburn and O'Toole. Bonnet the artist sports a beard and wild hair, the guards at the museum are lazy overfed nincompoops who ring more like the Keystone cops. And the art collectors, such as Wallach and others, are portrayed as easily-wowed buyers who are constantly mesmerized by the works offered by Bonnet. They shiver and quake when they see the artworks in Bonnet's possession, and when he refuses to sell, it only heightens their desires to have the works. In one stunning reversal, Wallach chooses art over Hepburn! Even I wouldn't trade a lifetime with Hepburn for a Da Vinci. Let's not delve into pure fantasy. Also, the music is somewhat like a Warner-Brothers cartoon with little effect-phrases complimenting the action. Certainly, it was very in vogue then, but it comes off as rather dated today.

The storyline is okay, but I wish it could have taken itself a bit more seriously. Other offerings from the period which were a little more serious have faired bettrer, such as ""The Thomas Crown Affair"". Still an enjoyable flick and Hepburn always brings so much magic to the screen. However, the cartoonish behavior of some of the characters, like the guards constantly fiddling with their ""French moustaches"", and the overly colorful music make the film a bit hard to swallow these many decades later.",1439596800,,3876,4.886018237082067

702117,4,6303631851,"I have often commented on the fact that no question the late 1930s, early 1940s were the golden age of screwball romantic comedies with such treats as It Happened One Night and Sullivans Travels just to name a couple. And I stand by that proposition as I review another screwball romantic comedy from the 1960s, How To Steal A Million. Maybe during the 1930s it was because movie audiences desperately needed a few hours off from the class struggle or just the struggle to get by day to day but this fatted calf 1960s effort lacks that pulling power despite the fine cast.

Heres the story line and maybe you can figure out why the thing fell a little flat. Bonnet, a high end French art forger (although art forgers are not always French), is a little bored with ripping off the culturati with his fake paintings and decides to show the world a sculpture, a fake by his father of Cellinis Venus in public in a well-known Paris museum. Daughter Nicole (played by fetching there is no other word for her, Audrey Hepburn) flips out at the idea since this stunt will get his a long stretch in the infamous French prisons, maybe Devils Island if that was the throw of the dice, but someplace harsh. The good Bonnet proceeds anyway despite Nicoles trepidations. As it turned out various law enforcement officials and reputable art dealers are on his trail, especially one Simon Dermott (played by he of the Lawrence of Arabia blue eyes, Peter OToole). He is out to stop Bonnet in his tracks, and clean up the art world a little. And that was an admirable ambition until he saw the fetching Nicole and was, well, smitten right off (and nobody on this good green earth could blame him taking the fall).

Heres the tricky part though, an American art collector Davis Leland (played by versatile actor Eli Wallach) is crazy to have that Cellini for his vaults and is bound and determined to get the object by fair means or foul. Along the way Leland plays with Nicole to use her to get what he wants. Nicole though is worried, worried to perdition, that dear old Dad is a goner so she tries, tries not very hard as the case turned out to have the dashing blue-eyed Simon cook up a plot to steal the statute from the museum and keep Dad out of the Bastille. And, well, smitten Simon takes the leap, falls for those brown moon-glow eyes.

The rest of film is filled with little off-hand capers (and kisses) as Simon goes low tech, very low tech by todays security standards in order to steal the thing. And as such things go, cinematically anyway, Simon pulls the caper off. And guess who gets the fake Cellini. And guess who gets Nicole. And guess who is not going to be having a diet of bread and water. Sure there were some madcap moments but the tension that held the 1930s romantic comedies audience in thrall even though they too knew the boy was going to get the girl or vice-versa is lacking here. Still I wouldnt mind having been in Simons shoes, wouldnt have minded at all.",1435276800,,2972,4.479704797047971

With art fakery once again in the public eye, there is a certain relevance to the (contrived) premise that underlies the film.

703169,4,6303631851,"It's silly and dated, but How to Steal a Million is still an engaging caper film.  Hepburn is charming and beautiful, O'Toole is handsome and quirky, and the supporting cast is clearly having a lot of fun with the outrageous, ridiculous plot about a woman who is trying to steal back her own property.

There's an inevitable love story which may or may not engage you.  I didn't feel a lot of chemistry between the leads, but when they're that pretty, and you're having that much fun, who really cares?  This isn't high art, it's a romp, and they do sell it.

I would single out Hugh Griffith in particular for a performance so completely over-the-top that it makes everyone else look sedate by comparison.  Eli Wallach doesn't seem terribly comfortable in his role, but he doesn't have a lot of screen time, so it's not distracting.  All things considered, if you're a fan of any of the actors, or if you just enjoy a light-hearted, clever caper film, give HtSaM a try.  It'll probably make you smile at the very least, and even laugh out loud with its sheer, good-natured silliness.",1419292800,,1084,4.609375

Not only were O'Toole and Hepburn radiant on their own and together, but even their cars were enchanting and sexy! They perfectly captured the lighthearted quality of the film set against the glory of  Paris. Not long after I first saw this film, I had my first babysitting job - the father came and picked me up in a ...... YELLOW XKE JAGUAR!!! I nearly passed out! I remember going back to see this film at least 4 more times. Now 48 years later, watching on a 11 x 14 computer screen, I am completely and totally enchanted. If this isn't proof of great talent with superb chemistry, I don't know what is.

Then you have Peter O'Toole at his loveliest.  And the two of them together is just beauty personified.  But looks aren't everything here.  The story is sheer delight, a finely crafted caper comedy with a twist of romance.  The acting is wonderful, from the leading stars all the way through to the minor supporting cast from Hugh Griffith, Eli Wallach down to Jacques Marin and Moustache.  And what can go wrong here with William Wyler at the helm.....absolutely nothing.

I don't recommend it as family entertainment only because Ms Hepburn's father while lovable is a shady character, he copies the great artists and sells only to the rich- fakes.  Also a family heirloom is seen as a priceless piece of art when in reality it is a nude statue of Grandma.  The statue's infamy is the reason for the story.  It is really quite fun but I do not endorse it as a moral lesson.  Everyone will enjoy Audrey's fashion-especially her mysterious look in black lace!",1416182400,,547,4.787234042553192

Nicole Bonnet, a smart young Parisian, comes from a proud family of art forgers. When her father allows a museum to display her grandfather's forged ""Cellini Venus,"" she ends up staging a desperate museum break-in to save her father from prison. In the effort to foil the high-tech security system, all kinds of ridiculous hijinks ensue (starring a boomerang, a broom cupboard, a wine bottle, and an ear-splitting alarm).

If you've never seen it, give this classic romantic comedy a chance!",1401408000,,768,4.517985611510792
704510,5,6303631851,"I am a lover of classic films and ran across this little gem on HBO Go that I was trialing. Why haven't I seen this stupendous film before???!!! Now I have loved Audrey Hepburn since my first classic film ""A Shot in the Dark"" from my film class, but I have only seen Peter O'toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.

First and foremost I didn't know that Peter O'toole was so handsome, he really was never on my classic radar, now Cary Grant was instant love. O'toole has one me over though with his charming on screen wit, charm, and leading man ability.

Now enters the ever beautiful and glamorous Audrey Hepburn and you have a cocktail for perfection. These two together steal the show. I love the over the top plot of this film, yes it may be unrealistic even for the late 1960's but it doesn't matter, because the comedic timing, and cat/mouse romance is so engaging that is just makes me laugh and smile time and again! The supporting cast is just as engaging, and set in Paris (who doesn't love Paris)! Wonderful actors, Art, great location, Audrey Hepburn's wardrobe....It has it all. And the score is done by none other than THE John Williams! That alone was an unexpected discovery, I will have to hunt down the film score now.

I could go more into the story of the characters, but alas I don't like it when people give things away to me, so I won't rob you of the intimate details. Suffice to say......if you are a lover of Hepburn, O'tool, Classic films or just films in general then please do yourself a favor and see this movie. I have added it to my personal collection, as well as my digital collection(I love it so much I wanted to be able to watch it anywhere).

I would give this film more stars if I was able too, simply for the fact that I can watch it time and again, and it never gets old, and I still laugh & smile knowing the outcome. Classic film perfection!",1401062400,,1911,4.359550561797753

How to Steal a Million is a great 'caper' film with some fantastic stars. Eli Wallach, Charles Boyer, Audrey Hepburn, and- oh my!- Peter O'Toole in his prime. If that's not enough, Ms. Hepburn's costumes by Givenchy are to die for! (A couple are a little over the top, but when you're designing for one of Hollywood's most glamorous ladies I guess you go all out.)

This isn't a madcap comedy like Bringing Up Baby or What's Up Doc?, which are classics in that genre.

Audrey Hepburn dressed in Givenchy, Paris in the 60's, Peter O'Toole, wonderful works of art, these are all worth seeing the movie for. The script is light in substance, and and there is no real chemistry between Hepburn and O'Toole, so it is scarcely believable that he will go along with her caper.

Wait just a moment, I also remember there is what I am forced to admit is a fantastic supporting cast, so that has got to get it one more star. And that makes three. Oh yeah, okay, Audrey Hepburn is at her remarkable best so that's got to be at least two more. That's already five stars, and I'm not allowed to give more than five stars, so I have to stop now. I can't give another star for this being one of the rare movies I watch again and again. No more stars allowed for good production values. I always laugh a bit while I watch it, but mainly I just smile through the whole thing so terribly much that my smile muscles hurt, but I don't mind so much my smile muscles hurting because this movie really does make me feel good.

Peter and Audrey's chemistry is pretty good (not as good as her and Gregory Peck) but enjoyable to watch. the film itself unfolds very entertainingly. and the way the heist is actually carried out is so simple and ridiculous that it just makes it (i'll say it again) fun.

Then they discover that it is scheduled for a technical exam, to validate its authenticity, and she decides the only thing to do is to steel it from the museum before that can happen.  She asks the only person she can think of that might be able to help her, a ""thief"" she caught in their house the night before, played by Peter O'Toole, but she has no idea what he was really up to.

705085,4,6303631851,"This movie based and filmed in Paris, is a guilty pleasure, delectable and satisfying as a rich French dessert for example Crepes Suzette, Cherry Clafoatis or Baba au Rhum!  The three primary figures most recent film efforts prior to filming had been rather challenging and most likely exhausting.  Audrey Hepburn had portrayed Eliza Doolittle in ""My Fair Lady"",  Peter O'Toole had two intense roles in ""Becket"" and ""Lord Jim"" while master director William Wyler's last two films had been the controversial ""The Children's Hour"" and the grim ""The Collector"".  They all probably welcomed this chance to have some fun, to relax after these weighty endeavors, and have the opportunity to just entertain an audience rather than having to be profound.  ""How to Steal a Million"" certainly does that, it won't mentally challenge the viewer, but it will lift your spirits!

Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffith) is an artist and art collector who has made a fortune selling masterpieces by such masters as Czanne and Van Gogh from the renowned ""Bonnet Collection"". However he is a master forger, selling off his own creations with no one the wiser except for his daughter Nicole, (Audrey Hepburn), who is understandingly anxious his duplicity will ultimately be revealed and wants him to retire.  He tips his hand when he rashly loans a marble statue of Venus by Cellini to a museum.  Actually his father sculpted the figure using his mother as a model.  The museum insures the ""Cellini"" Venus for a million dollars and Bonnet happily signs the release for the museum.  Too late he finds out that in signing the release he authorized tests of authenticity.  At this point in time (1965) although the technology wasn't there to test the genuineness of paintings, it was in fact there for sculpture.  Once the Venus is exposed as fake, the whole Bonnet collection will be under suspicion, and Bonnet will most likely be revealed and jailed.  Somehow the Bonnets must get the Venus back from the heavily guarded and alarmed museum before the test can be done.  Nicole decides to enlist the services of a very charming burglar Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) whom she has recently surprised in the act of stealing a Van Gogh from the Bonnet Collection one night.  However this amiable gentleman is unknown to Nicole a private investigator whose specialty is art forgery, and has in fact been hired by Bernard DeSolney (Charles Boyer) an art dealer who suspects Bonnet is a forger to prove it.  To further complicate matters an American industrial tycoon and art collector, Davis Leland (Eli Wallach), is obsessed with possessing both Nicole and the Venus.  Will Simon help Nicole steal the Venus?

No expense was spared to give this film a classically elegant style  The production design by Alexander Trauner is sumptuous in all respects, with photography in and around the City of Light.  Ms.  Hepburn's impeccable wardrobe is designed by her favorite designer and personal friend, Hubert de Givenchy, and her jewels are by Cartier.  The screenplay by Harry Kurnitz is light and nimble with the occasional nugget of wit, such as the title line of this review, or the best line which is a very adroit "" in"" joke uttered by Simon when Nicole makes a wardrobe change in his hotel room.  I won't spoil it and give it away, be on the watch for it though.  The sprightly musical score is courtesy of ""Johnny"" Williams, an early effort by the now famous composer John Williams.  Although celebrated director William Wyler forte was usually drama, he was versatile enough to master sophisticated comedy as well as proved by this and an earlier effort also starring Audrey Hepburn ""Roman Holiday"".

 Moving on to the principal players, although Audrey Hepburn doesn't really get to stretch her talents as a serious actress, that would happen next year with ""Two for the Road"" and ""Wait Until Dark"", she is enchanting as the damsel in distress.  This is a performance that relies heavily on her legendary charm and star quality which are very much in evidence.  I once read a quote about Ms. Hepburn that said she was kind of a barometer of fashion, looking each year as if she had been born for that moment in time, and that certainly applies here.  Ms. Hepburn sports a new ""mod"" hairstyle courtesy of one of the ultra-chic hairdressers of the era, Alexandre of Paris.  Her most spectacular costume is a slinky black lace cocktail dress with matching stockings and mask over her eyes, in which she is especially ravishing and sexy.  Also after three older leading men in her last films, Cary Grant, William Holden, and Rex Harrison, it's a refreshing change to have Hepburn teamed with a leading man that is actually two years younger than she!

After seeing recent images of Peter O'Toole, fragile, worn and cadaverous, this film is a reminder he was once a very dashing, handsome, vigorous young man with an engaging twinkle in killer blue eyes that rival Paul Newman's, and a powerhouse actor to boot.  Here he easily matches Hepburn with his own potent Gaelic charm; there is a delightful chemistry as they deftly play off each other.  Hugh Griffith's specialty was playing engaging rogues and scoundrels, and he does nicely here as Charles Bonnet with a manic gleam in his eye!  Although Eli Wallach is a good actor, he's not given too much to do with the role of Davis Leland.  He actually was a replacement for George C. Scott whom Wyler fired in the first day or so, for being late on the set.  In a very brief cameo, Charles Boyer rounds out the cast.

Regarding the extras, there is a commentary by Eli Wallach and Catherine Wyler the director's daughter that like most of the commentaries has some interesting facts and anecdotes.  I wish Peter O'Toole had given his insights, as he did in the DVD of his earlier film ""Becket"".  The best special feature is a biography of Audrey Hepburn from the A&E Biography series from 1997 entitled ""Audrey Hepburn: The Fairest Lady"".  The tribute is well done with commentaries by both her son Sean Ferrer and her companion Rob Wolders.  Finally, there is the standard trailer for the film, always fun to see how the film was advertised.

If you're a fan of either Hepburn, O'Toole or Wyler, sophisticated romantic comedy, the genre of the caper film,  or are just looking for a pleasant diversion, you want to give this film at least one viewing.",1352332800,3,6369,4.824125230202578

705087,5,6303631851,"How to Steal a Million deserves much more notoriety.  It is one of the best comedies I have ever seen.  Lest I give away the entire plot, I'll just say it's got all the things you want in a comedy:  clever banter/repartee, a complex plot, characters who are believable but also very quirky, madcap scenes, and absurd musical touches composed by none other than John Williams!  The casting and acting are perfect.  Audrey Hepburn plays the energetic kind of role she does best, and Peter O'Toole is outstanding for playing a Cary Grant kind of role without seeming like an imitator.  Hugh Griffith adds outrageous personality to the character of Hepburn's father, an art forger (who justifies it on the grounds of just selling it to rich people and not to poor people :-) ).  Eli Wallach makes a perfect high-strung art lover who ultimately ends up with the stolen work of art.

705167,5,6303631851,"- Nicole Bonnet, having recently shot Simon Dermott and now observing him grab his left arm: ""Your arm is much better.""
- Simon: ""Oh, no, no. It hurts, it hurts!""
- Nicole: ""It's the other arm!""
- Simon: ""The infection is spreading.""

Audrey Hepburn, with her timeless glamour and that delicate swan neck, is so damn disarming, I wish she'd shot me, too. When she accidentally pulls the trigger on Peter O'Toole - he was burgling her home, after all - the sequence which follows showcases not only her talent for light comedy and not only her not-too-shabby gams glimpsed thru the nightie, but also her sparkling chemistry with her male lead. I've seen O'Toole in his more highly touted flicks (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR, etc.), but I honestly have never liked him more than in this breezy romantic caper. And maybe part of it is because we see him thru Audrey Hepburn's eyes. Throughout the film, she bestows on him alternating glances of admiration and exasperation and bemusement. Of course, Hepburn, channeling her inner screwball, also has O'Toole reciprocating with his own series of wondering sidelong looks. And while O'Toole still comes across as wicked smug, to me, at least, it's not nearly as insufferable as in his other pictures. Here, he demonstrates an effortless comic timing and oodles of charm and is just a lot of fun.

The plot: Looks like French aristocrat Nicole Bonnet (Hepburn) had pretty much given up on reforming her master art forger of a father. At this stage she focuses more on minimizing the trouble he could land into. But when he donates the fake Cellini Venus statue to a museum and the museum then plans on an art specialist to examine the piece, a frantic Nicole hits on this brainstorm: Why not have a thief steal the Venus? Luckily, a dashing gentleman burglar had just broken into her home and although she'd ended up shooting him, they parted ways on good terms (because it's that kind of movie).

Based on a short story by George Bradshaw, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION hits the two hour mark, something which I really didn't note until the movie ended. The frothy storyline, the lighthearted score, the often playful dialogue brought to life by the bankable stars, and the romantic setting in the City of Lights - all these elements combine to make the film an entertaining watch, and it's really okay that HOW TO STEAL A MILLION isn't considered an ""important"" picture or regarded as one of the best ever produced by Hepburn or O'Toole. As she often does, Hepburn brings an air of style and sophistication, and in this one she's sensational in Givenchy, and, really, can a terrific romance be too far off? Peter O'Toole, he flashes those electric blue eyes and that rich, lordly delivery of his and motors around in that sleek canary yellow Jaguar two-seater. Their interplay is really fun to watch. Still, the centerpiece of the film features the overnight art museum heist, and how that caper unfolds is a demonstration in sheer cleverness. And then we're also treated to an unexpected brand of togetherness exhibited in a cramped broom closet. To echo Hepburn's breathy sentiment: ""Marvelous.""

Hepburn and O'Toole get good support from a veteran cast, from Hugh Griffith and his out-of-control eyebrows to a bit cameo from Charles Boyer.

He is known for his great art collection, but what people don't know is that he forges a lot of the art and then sells it.

However when Nicole and her father find out that a test of authenticity is required as part of the insurance coverage, Nicole is desperate to get it back and save her father. In her desperate attempt Nicole asks and pleads for help from Simon Dermott, whom she has mistaken for an art thief. Simon plays along with Nicole's request, as he plans the theft and romances Nicole at the same time. However Simon is not who she thinks he is, and he has ulterior motives.

Dressed to the nines in some gorgeous Givenchy ensembles, Audrey Hepburn is Nicole Bonnet, the daughter of a professional art forger (Hugh Griffith) who has made millions auctioning off ""long-lost"" pieces from the great masters.  The trouble starts when a Paris musuem wishes to exhibit Bonnet's rare Venus statue - another forgery!  Realising that the statue will be routinely examined by leading art specialists while on loan, Nicole teams with handsome art thief Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) to stage a daring robbery and ""steal"" the fake statue before anyone uncovers her father's illegal practices.  But is Simon all that he seems?...

This delicious romantic comedy, filmed on location in Paris, zips along at a fast pace despite it's quite hefty two hour running-time.  Audrey Hepburn dazzles with one of her most adorable performances, looking every inch the fashionable Parisian in her choice wardrobe of Givenchy clothes.  Peter O'Toole also has a fun role; though Eli Wallach is wasted as Nicole's would-be fiancee with his own designs on the Bonnet art treasures.  The musical score by John Williams is memorable, too.

705291,5,6303631851,"This movie was directed by Academy award winning director William Wyler, who directed classics such as; Mrs. Miniver, The Best Years of Our Lives, Roman Holiday, and Ben-Hur (1-4). It is also a pleasant surprise to see Audrey Hepburn team up with Peter O'Toole in this hilarious romantic comedy. Audrey is known for some pretty dramatic roles but this is one of the few movies that she played is a real screwball comedy. The plot of the movie is; Nicole Bonnet (Audrey Hepburn), the daughter of Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffith) tries to steal forged Cellini (statute, a work of art) from a museum with the help of an art investigator, Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole). Nicole is forced to take this risk because her father refuses to listen to her, since the forgery was committed by her grandfather and authentication process of the art by insurance companies would reveal the forgery and that could put the family into serious problems with the authorities.

The chemistry between the Hepburn and O'Toole is perfect. It is not surprising that the two would fall in love with each other even though their friendship starts and remains at a tolerable level of hostility; kind of love-hate business relationship. This is the second time; Director Wyler is teaming up with Audrey Hepburn, after their successful team work in his earlier movie Roman Holiday for which Hepburn won Academy award in best actress category. Davis Leland (Eli Wallach) and Bernard De Solnay (Charles Boyer) provide supporting roles as wealthy collectors of art.

My favorite scenes of the movie are when Simon breaks into Bonnet house to steal a fake Van Gogh, and Nicole catches him red-handed and accidentally shoots him in his arm. Later, when the two would-be-thieves are locked up themselves in a small closet space inside the museum, and Simon's crafty ways help them to unlock the door from inside. Highly recommended to all fans of Audrey Hepburn.

(After this, it was off to ""introducing"" Barbra Streisand to movie audiences in FUNNY GIRL.) HOW TO STEAL A MILLION is attenuated, it is slight and often feels elegantly elongated (almost as much as its two gorgeously emaciated stars) but Hepburn is at her most stylishly refined (though there are jokes when she dresses as a charwoman and still maintains her sangfroid and her style) and Peter O'Toole displays his comedy style (though if he underplays his nonchalance any more, he'd be asleep). As a counterpoint, Eli Wallach and Hugh Griffith mug outrageously, it's filmed on some lovely locations, and it's certainly a pleasant film (though that might seem to damn with faint praise).

705344,5,6303631851,"William Wyler's ""How to Steal a Million"" is the very best Stanley Donen picture that Stanley Donen didn't happen to make--just as Donen's ""Charade,"" also with Audrey Hepburn, is the very best Hitchcock picture that Hitchcock never made.

This is a truly stylish film.  ""How to Steal a Million"" looks like ten million ... a hundred million ... aw, in this inflationary era, let's call it a billion bucks on the screen.  Hepburn's roughly two hundred costume changes, her preposterous little car, her hats, her chateau, and everything else shout that this is what the (expensively) good life looks like.  In one scene, O'Toole invites Hepburn--for once looking a bit dowdy--to come as she is.  ""Give Givenchy the night off,"" he says.

A quick glance over the previous Amazon reviews shows that those who know and care about this film use the language of people discussing a classic.  And yet, whatever its considerable merits, ""How to Steal a Million"" was not a particular success at the box office when it first appeared nor is it widely remembered today.

I can only speculate why this should be.  Perhaps it was the proximity of ""Charade.""  Good as this film is, ""Charade"" was better--a tighter script, a better balance between thrills and comedy and the overwhelming presence of Cary Grant.  O'Toole has always been excellent in comedy, but his part in this film is unquestionably a Cary Grant part and nobody did those as well as the old master, Archie Leech, himself.  On the other hand, it may be that ""How to Steal a Million"" is a Willy Wyler film and it doesn't feel right or entirely at home among that director's works.  Somehow I doubt that Wyler's many admirers are likely to list this one high among his masterworks.  Or maybe it came out when the public was satiated with well-acted, lavishly produced, well-made films and it just fell between the cracks.

Whatever the reasons for its present semi-obscurity, ""How to Steal a Million"" is a gem and highly recommendable to anyone who believes that quality in movies extends beyond CGI effects and stuff blowin' up real good.  Five stars!

A NOTE ON CHANGING TIMES: When I saw this movie during its first run, along with everyone else in the theater, I thought a million dollars was a lot of money.  Just listen to the 1960s prices quoted for major works of art; they are laughable today--and a little sad, too.

A FURTHER NOTE ON MARKETING: This is a movie about high-end art forgery.  It is filled with exquisite paintings and sculptures in almost every scene, all of which were forged for the movie.  Part of the publicity campaign for ""How to Steal a Million"" was a public exhibition of the forged artworks.",1166745600,9,2672,4.752711496746204
705407,4,6303631851,How to steal a million was a light-hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right.  Audrey Hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by Peter O'Toole an expert in forged art works.  The two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper.  Once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances.  Greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork.  It is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone's head.  Dishonesty doesn't enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax.  Everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets.  The two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch.  Mind candy doesn't necessarily have to rot your brain.  It can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night.,1163376000,6,992,4.816568047337278
705408,4,6303631851,"The Bonnet's are a family of art forgers.  The current patriarch (Oscar winner Hugh Griffith) forges the masters.  He has just sold one of his masters.  The problem is that his daughter wants to break the family tradition.

To complicate things, dad has agreed to loan his Cellini Venus statue to a local Paris museum.  Of course this was really made by grandfather with grandmamma as the model.  While Nicole (Audrey Hepburn) has misgivings, there is little chance that the forgery will be discovered.  That is until dad signs an insurance policy and this means that the statue must be authenticated.

Now there is a problem.  Nicole decides to steal back the statue with the help of an art thief, Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) but what she doesn't know is that Dermott is a detective hired to prove that her father is a forger.

After a while Dermott agrees to plan the heist.  What follows is a great comic heist.

William Wyler is a master director at this time towards the end of his career.  But he proves that he still has his flair.  Hepburn was at a turning point in her career and proved that even with some fluff, that she has star quality.  O'Toole was early in his career and showed flair but you can tell that Hepburn held back to make him look better.

This is a fun piece of fluff and Audrey's fans will not be disappointed.

705410,4,6303631851,"Mr. Bonnet (Hugh Griffith) has an eye for fine art of the masters. You might say he also has a hand for it -- from counterfeiting. A burglary is interrupted by his daughter, Nicole Bonnet (Audrey Hepburn). Realizing that the police may bring the less than genuine art under scrutiny she lets him off easy.

Mr. Bonnet is generous enough to allow one of his (forged) art pieces to be temporarily displayed in a local museum. With an estimated value of one million dollars, naturally they want to insure it until it is returned so an authenticator is scheduled to arrive the next day. By now the film title makes sense. Parts of the movie are a bit silly but enjoyable nonetheless -- after all HOW TO STEAL A MILLION is a romantic comedy highlighting Hepburn's superb acting talent. Equally appreciated on the DVD is the well documented 45-minute biography chronicling Hepburn's rise to stardom -- which in itself is worth the price paid.

705411,4,6303631851,"How to Steal a Million is a very fun film that marks the pairing of screen legends Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. Hepburn plays the daughter of an art collector who is really a master forger that has painted everything in his private collection. When he loans one of his statuettes to the museum, Hepburn must find a way to steal it back before it is discovered to be a fake. She enlists O'Toole, a burgular she caught in her house, but who is in actuality an investigator out to unmask her father.

It's a very fun caper flick from the director that introduced Audrey Hepburn to the world in ""Roman Holiday,"" but it's biggest strength lies in the interaction between its leads. If you like either Hepburn or O'Toole or both, you'll love seeing their verbal sparring and interaction. They definitely don't make films like this anymore, and the character moments are quite enjoyable. Otherwise, there really isn't much of a ""caper"" here. If you're expecting something like the remake of Ocean's 11, you'll be very disappointed by how silly the actual heist goes down. Marks for creativity, but not for believability. If robbing museums was as easy as buying a boomerang and bucket, I'd be set for life.

The disc also includes an A&E biography of Hepburn, which is a nice capsule of her life and a good extra. How to Steal a Million is pure fluff, but its very fun and finely crafted fluff, and is worth checking out.",1141257600,3,1419,4.626984126984127

705414,3,6303631851,"Pretty young Audrey Hepburn enlists the aid of debonair burglar Peter O'Toole when it becomes imperative to her family's good name that a famous statuette be stolen from a heavily guarded museum.

 William Wyler's HOW TO STEAL A MILLION is a whimsical bit of fluff, an engaging boy-meets-girl tale that pits its charming and charismatic stars against a somewhat plodding and long-winded story.  The stars win, of course, but it takes them more than a long two hours for them to do so.  In the meantime, Audrey's papa (Hugh Griffith) donates a forged Cellini's Venus to a Paris art museum, and for it to be insured it must be inspected - an impossibly calamitous prospect for the rich, talented, and as-yet undetected forger.  A young Eli Wallach plays an art-loving American industrialist with an eye for expensive beauty.

 All the parts are in place, the Parisian surroundings are sumptuous, and Hepburn's Givenchy wardrobe is dazzling.  And yet there's something a little leaden about the whole thing.  O'Toole's character was apparently written for Cary Grant, but by 1966 Grant was much too old for the part, and, more the pity, O'Toole is too good an actor to do impersonations.  HTSAM seems to want to be a screwball comedy, but it's too long, the dialogue is at best functional, the pacing is too leisurely, and O'Toole has too many feet in reality to pull it off.  Either that or his character is so obviously tailored for Cary Grant you miss him despite yourself.

 Still, Hepburn and O'Toole are charming and appear to be having a good time.  A strong three stars for this ingratiatingly unexceptional comedy.  Also included on the dvd is a good A&E Biography of Audrey Hepburn.  Although you can knock these A&E bios for superficiality, or the eerie ever-presence of Richard Dreyfuss, I appreciate their generous use of film clips and broad outlines of the lives of the legends of the silver screen.",1140220800,4,1911,4.851851851851852

O' Toole is gorgeous with his blue eyes and soft English voice (sigh) the dialogue is so catchy, witty and intelligent. Art lovers everywhere should appreciate all the obvious (and obscure) innuendos that zig from Audrey to Peter, Peter to Charles Boyer, Audrey and Hugh Griffith (her father in the movie).

Lovely movie that shows a wonderful and beautiful pictorial of 60's Paris. The story a young women (Audrey) lives with her father in France. Her Papa is a forgerer of Art, his father before him did the same. Her father lends his ""Venus"" to a museum for a exhibition in order for the museum to do this he must sign Insurance papers in case of theft, it is insured for 1 million dollars after signing the papers the clerk tells him that it will be authenticated for the purpose of the museum... upon hearing this her father (as well as Audrey) flips out since they both know the statue is not real but a fake done by his father. Audrey must devise a way to get that statue back before the museum has it examined. As luck would have it Audrey meets a cat burglar who was in the act of (she thinks) breaking into her house.. played by Peter O'Toole she asks O' Toole to help her in this caper and eventually he agrees.

I won't tell much more than that as the reviews before me did a wonderful job of telling the details. I will say this I found it delightful, charming and very SMART in it's carefully placed ""zingers"" :) Eli Wallach as the american that is enamored but the Venus AND Audrey was funny too really good Sunday movie.

705473,4,6303631851,"This movie I give a solid four stars, but Peter O'Toole gets five because it's the most I could give.  (Hey amazon, how about a little room for upward adjustment under extenuating circumstances like these?)

I'm an Audrey fan and she's her usual delightful self in this movie, no longer the ingenue but every bit as lithe and fetching as ever.  She was a dazzler, but in Peter O'Toole she met her match.  He is something else -- the Jude Law of his day, I suppose!  (The highest of high compliments I give).  In ""How To Steal A Million"" O'Toole is suave and self-assured but never arrogant ... spectacularly good looking (hey, it's not his fault) ... witty but flawed, not what he seems and in the end, you're glad of it.  He can burgle my objects d'art any day!

The movie also has that very ""1960's"" look and feel to it that allow you to time travel, but not so far back you feel as though you've been whiplashed when it ends.  The '60's were in many ways more modern than the '70's, and played against the backdrop of Paris those burgeoning modern sensibilities find an excellent foil.  Audrey is her usual ""au courant"" self, except for one scene in which she has to play a cleaning lady.  Like Liza Doolittle, she would shine through a burlap sack.

O'Toole and Hepburn are very, very winning here.  The assorted cast of characters are daffy but mostly harmless, and if I'm not completely mistaken, the movie does poke gentle fun at the French.  (Not that terribly difficult to do, but then again we re-elected ... oh, never mind).",1102723200,70,1535,4.494584837545126
705474,4,6303631851,"How to Steal A Million was one of several elaborate heist comedies that formed sort of a subgenre in the 60's (Topkapi and Gambit to name a few others) This was Hepburn's first film after My Fair Lady and marked her last collaboration with William Wyler (who directed her in her Oscar winning role in Roman Holiday and The Children's Hour). Set in Paris, the tale involves a daughter (Hepburn) who hires who she thinks is an art thief (O'Toole) to steal back a statue sculpted by her art forger father (Hugh Griffith) before museum authorities test it for authenticity. The film is light and breezy, if a bit slow paced in the beginning. Neither Hepburn or O'Toole is required to do much acting, but they have star quality in spades and that elusive cinematic term called CHEMISTRY that is all this movie requires. Lots of eye catching Parisian locations, fashions and production values make this entertaining piece of fluff very easy to enjoy. The closet scene is a classic and Hepburn wearing washerwoman's clothes is a wonderful cinematic joke! (She even manages to look chic in that get up!) John Williams, pre-Jaws, provides a catchy score. They don't make movies like this anymore.........NOW IF ONLY FOX WOULD RELEASE TWO FOR THE ROAD ON DVD! This was one of Hepburn's finest performances and films and its shameful of Fox to keep it in their vaults!",1102550400,7,1357,4.778723404255319
705475,4,6303631851,"Charles Bonnet, Nicole Bonnet's incorrigible father, makes a living forging long-lost masterpieces and then selling them at auctions or to private collectors, such as American business magnate David Leland.  Bonnet's quite a character and is an artist, albeit a forger, living the moment, but also being the artist.  When he paints a Van Gogh, he IS Van Gogh.  Nicole is exasperated, worried that he'll be caught and sent to prison.  Charles' flippant response is ""The trouble is, you're so honest.""  So when he authorizes the loan of the prize of his collection, the Cellini Venus, a copy of it sculpted by her grandfather which her grandmother posed for, Nicole thinks her father has flipped his wig.  It is worth a million dollars--hence the title.
What Nicole dreads the most occurs when the museum announces that one Professor Bauer will be conducting tests to determine the statue's authenticity.  To that end, Nicole enlists the aid of Simon Dermott, a burglar she caught in her father's house trying to steal a Van Gogh (fake, of course), to steal her father's sculpture to save him from being jailed for fraud.  She doesn't tell him the real reasons, of course.  Dermott thinks it's a crazy idea, given the high-tech security devices and the numerous police detail milling around the museum, but combined by Nicole's persistence and her charm, finally gives in.  But just what does he hope to accomplish with a toy boomerang?
The actual heist and scenes in the museum are worth waiting for, as that's where the exciting parts are.  The cramped quarters in the broom closet underlines the tension of two people scared that they'll be caught, although it furthers the budding romantic storyline.  And Dermott's ingenuity is well demonstrated.  As he says, ""wait for normal human reaction.""  A particular comical touch comes in the form of a portly museum guard who has a large mustache and quite a fondness for the bottle.  Oh, and that alarm is pretty annoying, so beware!
Audrey's Givenchy fashions become ridiculously funny, such as the pillbox hat and large-rimmed sunglasses in her opening scene, and even becomes a point of parody when Dermott remarks at Nicole dressed as a cleaning woman, ""It Givenchy a night off.""  As it turned out, one night turned into thirteen years, as Givenchy was pressed back to work for Bloodline.
The last comedy Audrey acted in, How To Steal A Million, originally titled Venus Rising, was the third and last film Audrey did for William Wyler, after Roman Holiday and The Children's Hour.  It was also the first time Hepburn acted with a leading man closer to her own age since Anthony Perkins in Green Mansions, Peter O'Toole being three years her junior.  Her wide expressive eyes and that winning smile are put to good use here.  And she does have a great line:  ""You don't think I'd steal something that didn't belong to me?""
Hugh Griffith is fun to watch as the rascally Charles Bonnet, with the same bulging eyes, funny hair, and goatee.  O'Toole (Simon) is also an asset, suave, calm, clever, and quick with one-liners.  So is Eli Wallach (Leland), an excitable and impulsive millionaire with his sights on the Venus.  And Jacques Marin, who is the befuddled senior museum guard, previously appeared with Ms. Hepburn in Charade, as the chief of police.
Panned when it first came out, I'm not sure why this doesn't hold out even today.  Hepburn herself acted in it because she felt indebted to Wyler, who made her what she became, but at least she had fun with O'Toole, as the two were gigglers and many takes had to be required, especially in the broom cupboard scene.  It's an enjoyable and frantic caper film, a genre popularized by Topkapi six years ago.",1087948800,58,3707,4.846031746031746

The cast... Peter O'Toole has a very nice voice. Of course being Irish he would. He also possesses the prettiest eyes I think I've ever seen. He was perfect for the part. Nothing ruffles him, ever. Audrey Hepburn was wonderful too. Although one or two of her outfits left much to be desired... particularly the kooky one she wears on her first appearance in the movie. Her hair was definitely 60's, too. The dude who played Davis Leland was one winner. Once again they picked the perfect person. He had just the right measure of weirdness. The man who played Audrey's pappy was really weird too - with the beard and the bug-eyes and crazy hair. And I mustn't forget Senor Paravideo... for the two minutes of screen time he was given he did a superb job worshipping the phoney Van Gogh.
The plot and dialogue were both sparkling. No matter how frantic Audrey gets, Peter has a calm wisecrack to throw back at her. I love the part when he pretends to be seriously injured and she drives him home. Every museum scene was splendid, particularly the long museum scene when they steal the Venus. Very romantic and humourous. You gotta love the 60's music that plays when he's fooling with the key to the closet. Also the scene when she recruits his assistance to steal her own statue. She is wearing an outfit she should have won an award for. I have never seen such a weird outfit in my life! Black lace tights, slinky black dress, and a black hat with a lace mask over her eyes. And nobody thought she looked suspicious???

Coming in at a close second are the fantastic supporting actors.  Griffith is a riot as Audrey's father; just ignore the fact that they expect you to believe a guy who looks like that produced a daughter who looks like Hepburn.  His wife must've been Venus!  Eli Wallach is wonderful as Nicole's (or her father's?) suitor.  Had it not been for O'Toole's knock-out performance, Wallach would've stole the show.
Now, I'm most likely going to be lynched for saying this, but Hepburn's role was not up to par with her other performances, in my opinion.  When Nicole finds out why Simon is helping her, she quips ""I'm so stupid"".  Well, she said it, not me.  There is a fine line between naive and stupid, and Hepburn's character crosses it one too many times in this film.  You can also tell that she's looking, um, older in this movie.  It wouldn't have been so obvious had they not tried to make her look 20-something.  Of course, she's still beautiful and charming throughout.

Since this is a light romantic comedy it did not get as good reviews as his previous  works with Ms. Hepburn.  But the movie does its job, to entertain with  humor and style withouth overacting by the leading roles, just what a giddy  plot requires.  The details of the robbery plan is exquisite, alsmost  unplausible, wherein lies the intrinsic humor.
One important aspect of  this film is the work of Givenchy at his best.  He gave Ms. Hepburn what  the fashion critics called ""the Mod-ish"" look of the 60's.  Her  hair cut in the style of a helmetlike beehive, thick eyeliners, big bubble  sunglasses, all gave a funny as well as spooky touch to her look.  Promptly, followed suit a new wave of imitation lookalike after her,  including Sophia Loren.  On one level this movie ravished me with her new  fashionable clothes and looks.
There is a picture in pp. 188 of the  ""Complete Films of A.H."" by Jerry Vermilye, that show her face  half in the dark, it is one of her most stylished photos, and also a  wondreous example of photography with shades of darkness.
