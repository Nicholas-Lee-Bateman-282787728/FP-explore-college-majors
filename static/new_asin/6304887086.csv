There's a certain geekyness about the story, but it holds it's own up against the ignorence of the towns folk. It has some really original scenes, great music, and the actors really work well with eachother. It is totally believeable and certainly brings the sunshine into your home.",1184284800,2,379,4.757575757575758
936819,3,6304887086,"Not terrible, just too many problems for me to really fully enjoy.  The basketball coach is a complete dork, and the housewife is overweight and frumpish, so no way can you ever feel like there is anything hot going on. The love scenes were awkward, un-sexy. And the naked basketball playing? Uhhh, no. What worked was the reality that this kind of thing happens (the falling in love between women thing), the feelings between the women, and their developing love is sweet. The ending was very unrealistic though. If you absolutely have nothing else to do one day, it's not an entire waste of time.",1181952000,3,598,4.695238095238095
936820,4,6304887086,"I liked this film a lot and found myself smiling through most of it.  The lead characters look like school teachers, not actors, the script handles their emerging attraction in a fresh way, warts and all, and the situations they find themselves in feel real. There is a scene where they face their colleagues which seems a bit contrived, but maybe that's how they do it in Canada! In any event, the scene brings out the issues attaching to gay teachers quite well. All in all, a really entertaining film, especially for gay women past the baby dyke stage.",1178496000,2,555,4.606060606060606
936821,5,6304887086,"Falling in love with a woman, for the first time in mid-life, as many of us have experienced, is an astonishing occurrence. LATE BLOOMERS shows this to be true by including large doses of engaging tenderness and realistic scenes of stark honesty. In this film there are no women wearing slinky dresses, seducing one another in a pseudo-romantic Hollywood setting. Instead, Late Bloomers portrays finding love, and finding it just around the corner, all as it often happens. Quite unexpectedly, the lovers discover one another, and find the closeness and romance previously missing from their past involvements. One of the women is married, so if you first fell in love with a woman when married with children; you will appreciate the character's struggles and those of her family. However, alls well that ends well and this is without a doubt what this film portrays. LATE BLOOMERS is believable, with fine acting and a great story line. The women who play the roles of the two lovers are perfect, uninhibited in their lovemaking; funny, tender, and even sometimes fearful; yet always finding a way to stay the course together. LATE BLOOMERS creates an entirely possible story and presents it by using, not only some drama, but also a great deal of humor. Buy this film. You will absolutely adore it.",1096243200,33,1300,4.940639269406392
936822,4,6304887086,"Late Bloomers is an enjoyable sweet love story about two women who find love in the middle of life's journey. One woman, a school secretary, married with children, finds that her long marriage has died on the romantic vine many years ago. The other woman is a geometry teacher and girl's basketball coach who has never been in love. Through the learning and teaching of basketball, each woman finds in the other a love that they never thought they would find at this stage in their life.
I love that this movie portrays love and sex between two women who are not beautiful hard-bodied teenagers. It is fun however to see them react like giddy hormone driven teenagers in love's first blush.  The actresses did an outstanding job playing two women awkward at love and there was a nice chemistry between them.  I will never look at basketball the same way again and enjoyed the sport that plays as the platform for the women's romance.
The movie is meant to be part of the ""feel good"" genre so it is hard to criticize what appears to be unrealistic actions and reactions by some of the characters but I do have to say that the husband's reaction to his wife's new found love was quite implausible.
I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a lovely simple love story and would especially recommend it to anyone like myself who at middle age wants to see a semblance of their own life on screen.",1063670400,70,1405,4.5058823529411764
936823,3,6304887086,"Alright what I liked about the movie.
1. The two main characters were interesting. I liked seeing two middle aged women acting like hormonal teenagers. The early scenes between the two were funny and heartwarming.
2. There was more then one bedroom scene. To call them sex scenes would be slightly wrong. You didn't actually see the sex but you did see them together in bed talking like lovers. I liked that. Too many movies have one big love scene and thats it. I simply like to see two grown women having a passionate affair.
3. The husband/ex-husband. I liked him. He was a nice guy who seemed to be at a loss for why his wife fell in love with a woman. He had two really good scenes. One with the woman who stole his wife and at the end of the movie where he tried to expain why the two women got fired... I've read a few reviews that said he was unrealistic, and maybe he was, but I've heard stories about men who acted like him. Yeah they got angry but in end they were still nice guys.
What I didn't like.
1. The daughter. Don't know why. She just got on my nerves.
2. The ending. Don't know either. Just got on my nerves.
3. Some diaglog was awkard. Some characters were awkward.
All in all I'd give the movie a B. Better then some. Worse then others. But definitly a good movie to watch.",1054512000,17,1296,4.208835341365462
936824,5,6304887086,"Poignant story about two women who are surprised when they fall in love in the prime of their lives.  One, a spinster (coach), who probably grew up as a tomboy, and didn't really see the possibility of love.  I don't think she even considered loving anyone intimately.  She sees men as brothers to play sports with.  I'm not sure what her perspective on women is before this, probably just a person to have a superficial friendship with.  She is very lonely.  When she falls in love, she is like a little kid; pretending to play the clarinet while lying on her living room couch with relish , playing footsie under table during a faculty meeting, enjoying the hell out of her new relationship.  The second woman (mom) is married, but the romance died in her marriage a very long time ago.  It sounds like mom married very young, and she is afraid her daughter will get trapped in a young marriage too.  Mom is having difficulties trying to communicate with her daughter and her husband regarding her daughter's overflowing sexuality.  Mother and daughter have a very explicit discussion regarding sex.  The part I like best about the movie is the way basketball is used between the two as a method of seduction.  Mom starts the seduction at a school dance that the two are helping chaperone doing a very physical bumping dance.  Both women really get into it.  The two continue the seduction as coach teaches mom to play basketball.  Mom never having been good at sports is learning that there are things she can do better than she ever realized.  Then there's a great nude basketball playing scene - it'd never happen without a lot more privacy - at least not in any town in the good ole USA that I know of - but it's fun - very seductive.
Maybe being middle aged, I can better relate to this.  But I do not see coach as being a tired depressed individual.  I see her as a Martina Navitarola (sorry if I misspelled your name Martina), or Detective Tennison looking kind of person.  I also see her as honest, able to speak her mind without trying to be overbearing.  I see them both as sweet people who want to enjoy their relationship, without bothering other people, and without other people bothering them.
Super movie!!!!!!!!!",1044316800,27,2230,4.597468354430379
936825,4,6304887086,"There are lots of lesbian themed movies out these days, but this one is one of the sweetest so far... not for the homophobic - but a very positive view of true love between women... for the naysayers, if you are not a fan  of lesbian cinema,  don't rent it.  But for those of us who hunger for a  piece of their own lives in celluloid, this is definitely a must-have for  your lesbian video collection.  By the way,  Lisa Peterson was NOT 22 when  the movie was filmed. When it was filmed she was 25. When the moview was  released on video, she was 28.  Still, even at 25, she was not as  believeable as, say, a REAL TEENAGER would have been.

936922,1,6304887086,"This was a really difficult movie to watch.  In fact, I gave up on it twice and only returned to it for the sake of completing something I had started.  It certainly wasn't the LGBT theme that made the movie difficult to watch, but it was bad acting, a story line that doesn't feel like it was actually written by a lesbian, the tempo of the film was incredibly slow, and the cast weren't people I could connect with.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched!  If you're looking for a good lesbian themed movie, I would suggest you save your time and money with this one and look for something by Nicole Conn.",1360800000,,619,4.264957264957265

936926,4,6304887086,"The main story involves an under-appreciated hetero wife who falls for a mannish b-ball coach.  Their romance turns their school coworkers and parents' association on their small-minded heads but eventually many in the community recognize the true love these ladies have found with each other. Prejudices are examined and cast aside by many, including the unappreciative husband and slutty teen daughter.  Both actresses are touchingly poignant in their portrayals of two women swept up by unexpected emotions that affect everyone in their world.  For any woman ignored by her spouse because of her weight gain, and for any woman who feels sexless because she doesn't exhibit society's ideas of femininity, this film will give you hope for the possibility of love coming your way.

The teacher....looking into the unknown land of women with women.  Late bloomers?  Hmmm  I see more in their 50's.  But this is a story for the heart.  Their bond became solid in no time.  How wonderful!  It was never in doubt.  As it should be.  And to end in a wedding was the very best.  I wish I was that lucky!

This is so very sweet.  Their faces light up with a look at each other.  They know what they need to do and do it.  A love story I really, really love.

Driven by the roles they have chosen to play in their lives, one a working mom and wife, while the other is a teacher and the basketball coach...neither has felt alive or happy for quite sometime. In a wierd twist the two find each other. That may actually be the message here.  Love is filled with wierd twists and turns; you never know how it will come to you. In spite of the usual bigotries of a small town and its right-wing Christian mentality...love rules the day. Just like Jesus intended.

After watching this film I just felt good for days. It was refreshing to watch some very real people living real lives and being sincere about their feelings.

7878807,4,6304887086,"When high school basketball coach Dinah (Connie Nelson), teaches school secretary Carly (Dee Hennigan) how to play basketball, an impromptu kiss sends the women headlong into an unexpected romance.

Both in mid-life, the women finally find the love in each other that has been missing from their lives. After Carly leaves her husband, she moves in with Dinah and they begin an idyllic life together. When word gets out about their romance however, the school administration feels that they are a bad influence on the students and eventually the women's jobs are threatened.

Julia Dyer has created a wonderfully honest portrayal of two women in midlife finding love for the first time and how they deal with the challenges resulting from their affair. The sex scenes between the women are light, funny and tender.

Leads Connie Nelson and Dee Hennigan have portrayed incredibly well the dynamics between two women beginning a lesbian romance for the first time in their lives.
