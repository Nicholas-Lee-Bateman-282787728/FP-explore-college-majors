VANISHING LEGION trivia:

We never see the face of the villain in VANISHING LEGION. The character's voice was provided by Boris Karloff, who received no screen credit for the role.

Olive Carey, who appears as the Nurse in Chapters 9-12, was the wife of this serial's star, Harry Carey.

Frankie Darro was the son of circus aerialists. Being 5' 3"" meant that Darro was typecast in juvenile roles well into his twenties. He was an accomplished horseman, and also performed his own stunts out of necessity-- there weren't any stuntmen Darro's size to double for him.

Speaking of stuntmen, the actor portraying ""Stuffy,"" Joe Bonomo, is best remembered as stunt-double for Lon Chaney in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" Bonomo's precipitous rope-slide in that silent film is quite an amazing feat.

764151,4,6303987710,"I admit that ""very good"" is subjective & relative in this case.  This was made early in the sound era, and the overacting, especially on the part of child actor, Frankie Darro, is overwhelming, but I find that part of the fun.
Harry Carey portrays a character who is probably the oldest serial hero ever.  At least, I don't know of any older.  However, he is quite good and quite believable in the role.
Frankie's father is accused of murder, and attempts to clear him lead to seeking the identity of ""The Voice"" who is the leader of a gang.  In 1931, audiences may have been surprised to find out who ""The Voice"" is, but chances are you'll have him fingered before the end of the first chap;ter.
There are some good chapter endings, for a western serial, and some poor ones, but basically, it's a good action serial.  There are a few great photographic effects, and some very good directing.
It's dated, and it's pretty hokey, but it's fun and highly recommended to serial fans who are willing to make allowances for the time it was made.",1041033600,,1039,4.50531914893617

7859537,4,6303987710,"I guess that Harry Carey is one of my favorite western actors.  The top one of his era, and in the top five of all-time.  This is a Mascot serial.  Mascot made the best serials, in my opinion, and perhaps you will agree with me after you have enjoyed this one.  The bad guy, un-masked in the final chapter, was a surprise.  So buy this - - - you'll be infor a treat!",1393027200,,366,3.958904109589041
7859538,5,6303987710,"Mascot may have been a low-budget studio cranking out quickie westerns and serials during the early '30's, but their lack was actually their gain. While other studios had bigger budgets and bigger stars, Mascot's product - particularly the serials - had a grittier, almost documentary feel precisely because of tight budgets and shooting schedules. Retakes were rare, filming was largely on location, sets were worn and shabby, and action scenes involved real stunts performed without the aid of trick photography. This lent a spontaneous edge often missing from the more polished product the major studios were known for.

In 1931 Mascot's producer, Nat Levine, released the 12 chapter serial, THE VANISHING LEGION. Directed by Reaves Eason, the plot concerns a band of horsemen known as The Vanishing Legion who, it seems, are trying to ruin an oil company. Veteran character actor Harry Carey is the stalwart hero, and pretty Edwina Booth is the gang's duplicitous leader who, in turn, takes orders from a mysterious, unseen criminal called ""The Voice"". The actor supplying his sinister lisp is none other than Boris Karloff, the same year that he played the mute monster so memorably in FRANKENSTEIN for Universal. Acrobatic child actor Frankie Darro gives an exceptional performance in a supporting role. It was purposely decided to co-star Carey and Booth in order to capitalize on their appearing together in the great African adventure, TRADER HORN (MGM, 1931).

Kind of a semi-western, THE VANISHING LEGION has its generous share of thrills and intrigue as the identity of ""The Voice"" is sought after by Carey. Lots of fist fights, shootouts, daring rescues, and high speed car chases keep things moving in the traditional style of old time cliffhangers. This being an early talkie, as well as having to make do with Mascot's cheaper production methods, THE VANISHING LEGION betrays this at times when the whir of the camera motor is picked up on the soundtrack. There's also extensive post dubbing of dialog and sound effects as well as some undercranking in several scenes. None of this is meant as criticism; it's only a reflection of the time it was made.

Serial Squadron has released a digitally restored, complete version of THE VANISHING LEGION that looks beautiful, especially since such quality is rarely obtainable today in a Mascot serial. This DVD-R transfer employs slight tinting throughout, with a cooler black and white tone for night and indoor scenes, and a warmer tone for exteriors. The audio is clear and hiss free; all you hear is what exists in the original recording. An alternate commentary track is provided for chapter one. This is definitely worth picking up if you enjoy vintage serials.

Highly recommended.",1375142400,,2747,5.125

7859541,1,6303987710,It was totally forgetable. I never heard of these Saturday afternoon serials or any of the actors. It is obvious why. Your money can be much better spent.  I regret buying it as I;m stuck with them.,1345075200,2,198,4.351351351351352
7859542,3,6303987710,"THE VANISHING LEGION is alternately interesting, thrilling, confusing, and unintentionally amusing, but there's always something that keeps you coming back for the next chapter. Shot on a noticeably low budget by Nat Levine's Mascot Pictures (in only 18 days), this 1931 serial is an outdoor action tale that morphs into a Western and back again throughout its 12 chapters. Harry Carey and Frankie Darro, who had first worked together in 1924, are reunited and have lost none of their chemistry. Carey plays Bill Cardigan (oddly renamed Happy Cardigan in the later chapters, although nobody addresses him as Happy!), two-fisted foreman determined to stop whoever has been sabotaging the development of an oil field. Darro is an adolescent whose father is wanted by the law, and Carey looks out for him after his father disappears. Carey and Darro are easily the best actors in the film, and their sincere portrayals distinguish the serial.

The rest of the cast varies. Edwina Booth (Carey's co-star in M-G-M's TRADER HORN, hired by Mascot for name value opposite Carey) gives an expressive SILENT-film performance, clutching at her throat in dismay or reacting with sweeping arms and defiant stances, but her dialogue skills are limited and will probably invite chuckles. Tom Dugan, usually a resourceful comic, will not invite chuckles as a hanger-on who repeats whatever his colleagues just said. Dugan has absolutely nothing to work with, and should not be judged by his terrible turn in this one. Most of the other players are silent-film veterans who recite their lines as best they can. The mystery villain, ""The Voice,"" is enacted by Boris Karloff, who is never seen, but his easily recognizable voice is filled with foreboding.

The story has various gangs of marauding riders attacking the heroes and each other to secure the oil field. Between one faction representing The Voice, another representing the field's rightful owner, and one representing Carey's crew, you might lose track of who's chasing whom, and why. Director Breezy Eason keeps it moving just the same, and the outdoor photography and locations are impressive. Many scenes were filmed silent, with sound effects and incidental dialogue added later. Thus, the most strenuous action is unnaturally fast and/or noiseless, with sudden bursts of sound. (At one point Carey rescues Darro on horseback, and Darro's captors are only steps away, but neither they nor the viewers can hear the horse approaching!) Speaking of horses, we mustn't forget another silent-film veteran: Rex, the King of Wild Horses. The stubborn stallion hates everybody except Darro, and displays his temperament frequently. Movie villains never learn: don't get Rex steamed.

All in all, THE VANISHING LEGION is like some vague, vintage knick-knack that you'd find in a flea market: cheap and weathered, somewhat obscure, an obvious antique, but fascinating and endearing to the right customers. If you like Harry Carey or Frankie Darro, make allowances for the early-talkie awkwardness and you'll have a good time. The Serial Squadron set (on two DVD-R discs) is nicely restored from surviving prints. Another reviewer has problems with playing the Serial Squadron DVD-Rs, but the ones I have play just fine on two different machines.",1300233600,2,3282,5.247619047619048
7859543,3,6303987710,I've really enjoyed the Movie Serial's I've seen so far.  This one didn't keep my interest and I fell asleep while watching it.  I'll give it another try one of these days.,1297123200,,172,4.34375
7859544,5,6303987710,"Mascot made such wonderful serials; surreal, dream-like, yet having an almost documentary feel to them, as though you're right there, mixed into the bizarre goings-on. When the mysterious VOICE is unmasked in the final chapter it just can't be that person because he was present several times in the presence of others when the voice would broadcast over shortwave!!! An error in plotting? Nah, it's just Mascot being Mascot and such things are of no matter in the Mascot universe of things.
Harry Carey plays Happy Cardigan, oil rigger trying to bring in a well and battling both The Voice and The Vanishing Legion at the same time while helping Jimmy Williams clear his father Jed Williams of a murder charge. Edward Hearn plays Jed, sexy Garbo-ish Edwina Booth is heroine Caroline Hall, the best child actor of the time Frankie Darro is young Jimmy, former silent Western star William Desmond is the sheriff, and Rex, King of the Wild Horses is, of course Rex. The usual posse rounds out the cast of henchmen and others: Bob Kortman as The Voice's right hand man, Joe Bonomo, Yak Canutt, Dick Dickinson as The Vanishing Legion. Old timer Lafe McKee plays Hornbeck, an attorney and Olive Fuller Golden (Harry Carey's wife) plays Miss Lewis a suspicious nurse.
The Alpha dvd is watchable, dark in spots, soft and fuzzy in others, poor sound in general, quality varying from chapter to chapter. Serial Squadron (you have to go to their web site to order) put out an excellent re-mastered version, the picture image being generally clear and sharp. The audio is also light years better than Alpha's however sprocket noise is unavoidable. My problem with Serial Squadron is that their menu is difficult to access and their discs don't always read. I had to keep trying to get things going. Also the image froze a couple times but then played fine when I reversed play then went forward again.
All in all I'd recommend buying the Serial Squadron version. The problems were minor and the difference in quality is astounding!
A previous reviewer listed some VANISHING LEGION trivia...I'd like to add some more:
1)According to his wife Olive Carey, Harry Carey could not drive a car and never did learn. All his driving scenes were faked. She used to drive him to work every day, hence her casting in VANISHING LEGION.
2)Edward Hearn who plays Frankie Darro's father Jed, the accused murderer on the run, was a known homosexual. His constant hugging and kissing of young Darro must have raised some eyebrows at the time.
3)Silent Western star William Desmond wore the same clothes as he did in his two silent classics THE RIDDLE RIDER (Universal 1924) and THE RETURN OF THE RIDDLE RIDER (Universal 1927). Desmond also starred in THE VANISHING RIDER (Universal 1928).
4)When Voice henchman Bob Kortman (he's the real ugly guy) is seen in a pin stripe suit Olive Carey tells the story, ""...Bob Kortman needed a buiness suit. He'd forgotten to bring one with him. The scene had to be shot. Nat (Levine, the producer) jumped into a rain barrel, took off his own pin stripe, and gave it to Kortman.""
All the above info is in Jon Tuska's wonderful book on Mascot Pictures, THE VANISHING LEGION!
If you like this serial you may want to try Mascot's THE PHANTOM OF THE WEST (1930) starring Tom Tyler. The Alpha dvd of this one is EXCELLENT! And it also has mystery riders in it!
