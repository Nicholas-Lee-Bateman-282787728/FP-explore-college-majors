2198360,3,B0006ZXN6W,"Honestly, I was expecting for something much more modern, but then, the main idea is to improve your singing skills. First lesson I learned: you need different warm-up techniques for different music genres. I had several teachers in my 10 year old singing career but nobody told me this! Can't wait to explore the DVD even deeper. Still waiting for a more modern version.",1313712000,19,371,4.8125

2198362,5,B0006ZXN6W,"I am really glad i got this DVD after buyiny the book it really help me to see more clearly what she was explaining in the book. i needed to know how to exercise and train my voice without damaging it,maintain a healthy voice,breath control, singing from my stomach without straining my neck muscles and the basic start up exercises i could use for my warm up and teach my fellow choir members by showing a demonstration by a PRO.she is really a PRO on this topic (i have tried others, i know what i am talking about)
i believe this is one of the very best materials available in the market.she goes straight to the heart of what you need to know and this works very well for me. i would buy any other product she put out anyday. i aready have all 3 of her materials thanks to Amazon.com",1290038400,48,787,4.218543046357616
2198363,3,B0006ZXN6W,"The girl in this video was way out of my range. I have bass range. I tried following along one two octaves below.

The example student sings flat a lot, which seems to be common problem with sopranos. Anne helped with this problem by providing useful advice. I don't have that problem so much. I have other problems I'm working on that were not discussed here.

I would have liked a video that is more inspiring and enthusiastic. I like to see a powerful performer who has a rich tone.

The exercises were presented only briefly. I would liked to have seen the exercises performed all the way through by an exemplary pro (a rich bass, ideally).

The exercises and practice routine could have been presented a lot more thoroughly.

I would have liked Anne to speak to me (the viewer) more.

I was a little disappointed. I found this video to be a little uninspiring and not suited for me. It was well thought-out, though, and I might recommend it for beginner female voice students.",1166227200,19,981,4.545454545454546

2198370,3,B0006ZXN6W,"I'm not any professional singer. Just a guy who's even too afraid to do Karaoke. But someday, who knows? Figured I might as well learn from the best. Berklee Workshop is a good teacher.

Some singers have such a relaxed and almost effortless way about them with a great richness and tone. Example, I heard a youtube search for Ricky Nelson singing ""Yesterday's Love"". Great tone and melody and he made it sound so easy! Or closer to our own time: Celine Dion. What a voice! How do these people do it? I will probably never sound anywhere close to them, but this training is helpful. Good info! Improve your Voice--with Vocal Technique.",1363996800,2,635,4.619469026548672
2198371,3,B0006ZXN6W,"I was looking for something along the lines of this DVD; however I was a little disappointed in that there was more talk and less singing.  The instruction was very good, but I was looking for more warm-ups and more singing techniques.  If it was made with just the singing and LESS talking, it would be better, but then, I'm not an expert--I'm just starting out.",1359676800,14,363,4.484848484848484

2198373,5,B0006ZXN6W,"We have a small church choir with limited singing abilites and limited funds-- so we did a Sat. workshop and used this as a ""great"" tool for helping create a much better sound and an understanding of ""how"" to sing thus creating a pleasing sound--Everyone loved it and found it extremely helpful--Would suggest it to many! church choirs- If you have even one person not knowledgeable of what they are doing in any respect, they can ruin your sound fast--
