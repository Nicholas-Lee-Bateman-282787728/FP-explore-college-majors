8609571,1,B008I73SHE,"Poorly made documentary, the interviews with the local Balkan ""experts"" pulled the documentary even more down. This film should have focused more on landscape, the people and the food, instead half of it was spend interviewing some unknown, uninteresting people to hear their worthless opinions on Edward Lear.

Point is, the actual documentary is nowhere near as presented on the commercial. Don't buy it.",1400716800,,406,5.34375
