8140771,5,B000HR193S,"The DVD was very good. Enjoyed all the songs. Loved the Cathedrals featured on Boundless Love. Ernie Haase featured on Ten Thousand Years, was awesome, what a tenor voice!",1352937600,,171,4.931034482758621
8140772,4,B000HR193S,"""This is My Story"" is one of the early tapings of the Homecoming Friends series. I enjoyed the exposure to some new artists but was disappointed not to hear from other more familiar ""friends"" who were participating in the group numbers.

Among my favorites were ""Ten Thousand Years featuring Ernie Haase, Boundless Love sung by the Cathedrals, and Larry Ford's ""He Giveth More Grace."" I was touched by the testimony of Donald Ring as well as the way he opened the songs ""What a Day That Will Be"" and ""How Beautiful Heaven Must Be."" The Homecoming friends joined in the singing. Their smiles, tears, and voices evidenced respect, awe, and a graceful acceptance of Donald's challenges. A memorable, emotion packed, moment in time.

The program was fast moving with a strong gospel message. I have added this to my library of Gaither Gospel Series favorites and will be sitting back again soon to relive this experience in meaningful worship.",1296950400,,939,4.89937106918239

8140774,5,B000HR193S,"'This Is My Story', is yet another Wonderfully enriching and great music. All of the Homecoming Friends are so great together. I didn't find this one weepy, as the other person said, but then, there usually are some weepy moments in most of the Gaither Homecoming videos, as the music is just so incredibly beautiful.

Due to all of the depressing news and violence on shows and in the real world, I have stopped watching TV for the most part, and now watch my Gaither videos every day.  They bring me peace, including this one, and I just LOVE Southern Gospel Music.

Growing up, I never knew all of these groups existed.  I am so grateful I found them. Actually, my husband did and introduced them to me. I have always loved excellent harmony, and you will get all you want on any of the Gaither Homecoming videos/DVDs. I think how we react to things we watch, can have a lot to do with the mood we are in that day, as well.

Many of these tapes were recorded a number of years ago now, so they might not be around a whole lot longer.  I hope they will be, but personally, I wouldn't want to take the chance. Get them while you can. So many of the beloved singers are now in heaven, but we have these tapes and DVDs, so they will stay alive to us.

I very seriously doubt you will regret having bought any of the Gaither Homecoming shows, but might very well be VERY sorry you didn't buy them when you had the chance.",1239494400,6,1419,4.25278810408922
8140775,2,B000HR193S,I watched this video & found myself feeling depressed.  Unusual for a Gaither video.  Most of them are very uplifting and inspiring.  I would not say this was one of the best.  Only interesting moment was celebrating Billl's 60th birthday.,1221868800,3,239,4.9
