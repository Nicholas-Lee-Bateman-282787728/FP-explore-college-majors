8216703,3,B000V6LT0I,"The production quality is very good, and the African beat music is also very good (even if it doesn't match the sloppy gymnastics by Chinese performers), but the circus tricks are poorly done, the acrobatics are sloppy, and their supposed kung fu is attrocious.",1198540800,,261,4.954545454545454
8216704,5,B000V6LT0I,"This is the true Shaolin Kung-Fu Spectacular! It's a much better DVD than Wheel of Life. No cheesy acting, or goofball mimics. Everything is real! The stunts, and the weapons. Great Booklet to go with it.",1193961600,3,204,4.694444444444445
