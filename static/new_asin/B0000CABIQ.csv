1916511,5,B0000CABIQ,"I am a huge fan of Crime Story, Season One (the second season was a tremendous disappointment) and I cannot wait for this DVD to hit the streets tomorrow. I wanted to clarify something from the Product Details, specifically the line ""Contains all 22 episodes and the pilot."" That sounds like there are 23 episodes including the pilot, right? Unless there are some secret episodes I don't know about, there were only 20 episodes, including the pilot. There was a recap episode with minimal new material that aired on cable (USA?), and if you count the pilot as two episodes (it was two hours), that brings the total up to 22. So the Product Details are technically correct, but slightly misleading.
It's a GREAT show and I highly recommend it. My one concern is whether or not it contains the period songs that were originally included in the sound track (the DVD release of Wiseguy Season 1 does not). The recent broadcast of Crime Story on A&E did not have these songs and it hurt the show in my opinion. Those who have never seen it might not even notice, but those of us who are big fans will be sorely disappointed. My rating of 5 stars is based on the assumption that the songs are included.",1067817600,4,1196,4.516129032258065
1916512,5,B0000CABIQ,"Producer Michael Mann struck ratings gold for NBC with his police drama Miami Vice, and thusly made another attempt for the gold by launching Crime Story. The series was a complete contrast to Miami Vice with it's dark and gritty tone, as opposed to the trendy, bright, neon-flash of Miami Vice. In Miami Vice, the two lead cops were purposely designed to be hip and trendy ""MTV Cops"" as then-NBC President Brandon Tartikoff demanded. In Crime Story, the cops generally wore dark suits and drove dark cars with fins set against a dark '60s Chicago backdrop reminiscent of the pulp crime noir of the original 60s Untouchables series starring Robert Stack. Ironically, during the show's second (and final) season, the Brian DePalma Untouchables remake hit theaters, going on to become the hit movie of that year.

 Although NBC gave Crime Story two seasons, it failed to attract a large audience, leaving only a handful of loyal viewers who tuned in each week to follow the exploits of police Lieutenant Mike Torello (played by Dennis Farina, a former real life Chicago cop) and his Major Crime Unit squad's two-season long (1963 Chicago to Las Vegas) pursuit of crime boss Ray Luca (Anthony Dennison) and his ""loyal"" henchman, Paul ""Paulie"" Taglia (played by John Santucci, a former real life criminal). In addition to great good guys-bad guys interplay, the first season offers the involving sub-plot of Torello's shaky marriage to his wife Julie, played with ""can't take your eyes off of her"" appeal by the bewitching Darlanne Flugel. By midseason, Torello's life takes a dramatic turn, both personally and professionally, culminating towards a ""killer"" season one finale that should NOT be missed!

I originally taped the Crime Story pilot from TV back in 1986, then got it again when it was first released on VHS a year or two later, ultimately passing on the DVD pilot because I knew  eventually somebody would release a box set. I am still [pleasantly] surprised that the pilot was also included in this set, considering it was previously released as a stand-alone DVD. Thank you, Anchor Bay Entertainment!",1065657600,7,2111,4.988636363636363
1916513,5,B0000CABIQ,"Miami Vice fans will know that this was a definitive series.  Made by Michael Mann, and featuring some characters that appeared in various Miami Vice episodes.  This is truly amazing, and goes more in depth with story line that Miami Vice did - the main point being that the series concentrates on one main villain's rise to the top.  It is gripping and will have you yearning for more.  Please release series 2 as well.
For those that are not aware of the ins and outs of this series, this stars Dennis Farina (a well known TV & Movie actor), as a lieutenant hell-bent on catching a low time turned high profile villain - Ray Luca.  With his team, they attempt to track down the villain and his team.  The story starts in Chicago for the first series, and moves on to Las Vegas for the second series as they try and home in on the movements of Ray's unstoppable rise.  Along the way, cops, informants, and innocent people get killed.
I would say that despite having the mood of Miami Vice and a similar direction, there is plenty for all-round cop show fans too.  You will notice appearances from people that have recently starred in other cop shows - for example the guy that plays Manni Wiseman appeared recently on Law & Order (shown last week in the UK).  The acting is superb, and the storyline gripping.",1062374400,10,1310,4.470588235294118

1916531,5,B0000CABIQ,"I never saw the original series on TV and only just learned about it after renting the movie/pilot episode from the library. I was hooked and wanted to watch the series but couldn't find it anywhere until I looked here. The set arrived quickly, was in perfect condition, I was happy the two hour movie/pilot was included in the set, and I thought the whole series was great. The audio seemed perfectly fine to me, other than a few, short, moments where it dips a little. But the series was transferred over from tape, and tapes are known for degradation, so I don't think that could be helped. But it never drops so low you can't hear, or even have to strain to hear, so I'm happy. I would definitely recommend getting this set.",1366761600,,728,4.440298507462686

1916533,4,B0000CABIQ,"Some the negative reviews of this boxed set caused me to hesitate ordering this series that I lusted after for so long. The video is not state of the art and does indeed look precious little better than it did when broadcast on our low definition, CRT television sets back in the 1980s. So much more could have been done to clean up that typical, grainy 1980s era film but the DVDs are watchable and not distractingly muddy as some reviews have suggested. I guess if you grew up post-VHS tapes you can find many technical issues to complain about but if you're not a videophile or techie you'll be able to watch it without becoming nauseous. My only complaint with this set has to do with me being an old man and now picking apart a love of my youth, i.e., the show's attention to the period correct details of the early 1960s lapses a bit after the first disc. 1970s and 80s cars are visible in scenes and later music gets slipped in after Torrelo tells us all he will take down Luca the right way. Still, it's a bargain if, like me, you have been unable to find a collection of these episodes since they went of the air two and half decades ago. Buy it like you would a limited-time-offer, re-introduction of Jolt Cola and enjoy it without worrying too much about the taste not being as sweet as you remember.",1361836800,,1311,4.355102040816327
1916548,1,B0000CABIQ,"There are a number of DVD versions of Crime Story to choose from.  This review (or non-review) refers specifically to the version produced overseas entitled Crime Story Series One released by Boulevard Entertainment.  The DVD's are advertised as ""NTSC Region 0. Will play worldwide."" on Amazon and on the box itself.  As I am in the U.S. where NTSC is still the standard, I decided to do a bit of research to find out about Region 0 discs.  In theory, anyway, an NTSC Region 0 DVD should indeed work in any Region 1 NTSC player.  How this plays out (or doesn't, if you'll excuse the poor humor), though, is what this warning is about.

I own both a Panasonic DMR-EZ17, and more recently, a Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Blu-ray player.  These discs will not work in either player.  Both give simple message ""Cannot play.""  I gave Panasonic a call on this and the best that they could offer is that the manuals do not specifically state that Region 0 discs will play.  While I didn't find this all that helpful, it certainly does let Panasonic off the hook, as they are not obligated to try to find out why a disc which they have not claimed will work, won't. (It should probably also be noted that the BDT210, which is an outstanding blu-ray player, hasn't had a single issue with any region free blu-ray discs, of which I own quite a few.) I also emailed Boulevard Entertainment on this problem, but as of this date, have not received a response of any kind.

Interestingly, the discs work just fine on my computer.  Unfortunately, playback on a small computer screen is not why I purchased the set.  In short, I suppose that what I want to say is that an advertisement which says that a disc will work worldwide (which I presumed to mean in any region locked player) does not necessarily mean that it will.  The set will go back to the retailer.  I hope to save any would be purchasers a bit of time and pain (though your own results, as they say, may differ).

I'm also interested in any thoughts (or info) which anyone may have on what I might've missed in determining to purchasing this item.  Thanks much.",1332806400,,2102,4.503957783641161
1916549,5,B0000CABIQ,"There was a period where produced Michael Mann's TV unit seemed to be changing TV in an exciting way.  Everyone knows Miami Vice the highly stylized in sight and sound series.  The show cut a wide swath in viewer demographics and seemed to signal a shift in cinematic production qualities and ground breaking use of music.  Perhaps, though, behind the visuals there was a bit of the same story re-hashed with different paths taken on the decision tree.  It lacked some needed earthiness in spite of it being wildly popular in its day.

Enter Crime Story, a production that seemed to be more in with what Michael Mann was truly interested in telling in the realm of his beloved subject: criminals and lawmen.  It wasn't an easy sell due to the high cost of producing a 1960's world (i.e. large sets and outdoor shoots).  Mann was on a roll and the project, thankfully, was given a ""green light"".  Unfortunately, the cost to produce the series combined with steadily dwindling viewership sunk the series after the second season.  Crime Story's demise was certainly not due to excellence.  It started good, got a lot better with every episode and ended its first season spectacularly (signaled the new way of guaranteeing maximum ""water-cooler"" talk in order to build momentum for a new season).  A second season which, though great, was noticeably weaker than it's preceding season highpoints sank into less and less support in both viewership and network support.  A shame really this fantastic show didn't get more support so it could grow into itself.  If, like the Sopranos, a show this one definitely begat, this show was on cable as cable is today we'd have had five or more seasons no doubt!  Crime Story was a victim of being an insider (i.e. cultish) show when networks had to have massive viewership to offset major production costs.

This brings us to the DVD reemergence of a small injustice:  Crime Story long out of print in VHS and, seemingly, unavailable on any network.  Does the DVD set deliver?  Yes, if you are primarily glad just to be able to view a fantastic series that is long lamented and a bit less if you are expecting a ""state-of-the-art"" frame-by-frame pristine audio and video reconstruction.  It appears little, if any, pain-staking fixes were applied to the video and the only audio changes seem to be substitutions of a bit of backing music likely due to either royalty costs or licensing problems.  All-in-all, a really decent DVD collection if not reference quality (and there are basically no extras if that is something you may be wondering about).

The show itself is where the ""beef"" is.  Not since I was a kid watching, then ancient, episodes of  ""The Untouchables"" did a crime TV show invest me like Crime Story did and does.  It really delivers and I grew to love every character.  The casting is where the bedrock lies as Dennis Farina and Anthony Denison head up a cast that is pure excellence in execution.  The gritty Chicago 1960's sets, complete with a car buff's dream stable of period automobiles, are spot-on for realism and atmosphere.  The Las Vegas move in the last third of the first season was brilliant and those sets are equally, if not more, impressive.  The music was, like Miami Vice, groundbreaking.  Not only was period music used to great effect, but the original music was edgy and quirky to the point one could probably have a cinema class just to study it as much of it shouldn't have fit yet made a deeper , more atmospheric, backdrop.  Then there is the great depiction of organized crime where Dennison's unbridled power lust is framed with his witless underlings Pauli and Frank, played with aplomb by real life thief John Santucci and Frank Levine, as well as the ""godfather"" which Joseph Wiseman nailed with a balanced restraint that oozed a very dark ominous power.  I cannot say enough regarding the excellence in casting as every character really was a jewel.  Add to the cast many guest stars being new faces, several for their first ever TV roles (Julia Roberts, Gary Sinise, Ving Rhames, Christian Slater, David Caruso, and Kevin Spacey) and Crime Story further impresses.  This show simply had uniform high quality and a period depiction with style that was over-the-top.  Finally add Chuck Adamson's writing, as well as his hand-picked co-writers, for compelling, realistic and many times gripping story-lines and you have a definitive series that was all too short.  Crime Story is simply one of the best short-lived TV-series ever produced and in spite of the DVD's shortcomings is still recommended without reservation as a high-point in TV crime shows.

1916559,4,B0000CABIQ,"In reference to:
Crime Story TV Series Seasons 1 and 2:

The original Crime Story series (1980's) produced by Michael Mann was a superb drama that had everything;  a great cast, great writers, great producer (I have bought many DVD's on the strength of the producer alone, Michael Mann), and as always great music that perfectly blended with every scene.  I do not regret buying both seasons on DVD, but I agree with others that justice was not done with regard to the music and other production details - the RIAA and the MPAA are to blame for this, in my opinion, and I think Michael Mann should sue both the RIAA and the MPAA for compromising the integrity of his masterpiece but short-lived series.

I purchased both seasons around Christmas time because together I got them for under $40, yet if I had read the reviews first I might not have purchased them even at that very low price.  I bought partly because of the great music that accompanied the Crime Story ""sound-track"" (does one exist?), and partly because I loved the story, the acting, and everything else about the show - Mann put together an incredible cast and wonderful guest stars that might amaze people unfamiliar with the show.

Since what I purchased was presumably crippled intentionally by the contentious RIAA and their insistence that the record industry get a cut of almost every bit of accompanying music, and I presume that the MPAA imposed limits on the quality of the video reproduction, I still rated Crime Story a 4 out of 5;  the story, the characters, and writing still stand up well enough to make it excel despite being deliberately sabotaged by above-mentioned, but of course, ""well-intentioned"" organizations.

In spite of being pained by watching scenes where the original music has been substituted with elevator music - if you were a fan of the series when it came out, you will wince at the banal substitutions - and the low resolution (I'm sure that the original tapes could provide much better resolution) of the video, the story and the acting is still wonderful, and I do not blame Anchor Bay for the audio and video shortcomings;  I blame the blind and greedy music and movie controllers who have stolen, by means of the DMCA and DRM restrictions, ""fair use"" from their own customers and from companies who, by distributing original reproductions intact would ultimately lead to greater profits to the RIAA and MPAA.

I'm glad I bought it, but I would recommend that other fans wait until it comes out in a fully restored version with the original soundtrack and higher resolution.  Still, if one has not seen the original series, I'd recommend buying it, but not at a price-point one penny over $19.99 per season.",1231545600,2,2714,4.76545842217484

1916563,4,B0000CABIQ,"One of the most influential TV shows ever is also one of the most criminally underseen. 'Crime Story's' effect on film and TV is immense  and it's influence of some today's classic's is vast and deep.

You'll be reminded of everything from 'The Sopranos' to 'LA Confidential' to Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' and even 'Deadwood' plus many other great show's (even the dreadful film 'Mulholland Falls). All have drawn inspiration from 'Crime Story'.

Clever visuals, canny use of music and full story arcs for  minor characters make 'Crime Story' a trendsetter. Creator Michael Mann would bring these styles and themes to full effect in his brilliant 1995 film 'Heat'. And there's the wonderful, often ironically black humour that courses through the series, again seen recently in both 'Sporanos' and 'Deadwood'.

'Crime Story' takes a few episodes to really find it's feet, but kicks into top gear with the 'Abrams for the Defense', a truly potent mix of social comment and slam bang crime, guest starring a young Ving Rhames. After that, the show is at it's best focusing on the endless struggle between Lt Mike Torello and the vicious, rising mobster Ray Luca.

The casting is magnificent and the performances are dynamite. Dennis Farina was born to play Lt Mike Torello and Anthony Denison has never been better as Torello's arch nemesis Ray Luca. Highlighting the show's great humour is the chemistry between Denison and John Santucci as his dim witted offsider, Paulie. It's a tribute to the actors and scriptwriters that Luca and Paulie can be have some hilarious moments-usually Luca berating Paulie's lack of brain cells- and be ruthless killers the next. Then there's strong work from Stephen Lang as lawyer David Abrams. No one quite does raging ethical and moral indignation like he does. And don't forget Ted Levine, whose almost supernaturally sleazey (he went onto be the killer in 'Silence of the Lambs') as another Luca henchman, Frank Holman, who's both comically pathetic and utterly deadly. Plus there's Andrew Dice Clay perfectly cast, Bill Smitrovich, Billy Campbell and many other familiar faces fill out the regular cast. Plus there's potent contributions from a stellar guest list from TV and film, everyone from Kevin Spacey, David Caruso, Gary Sinise and Julia Roberts, to perrenial bad guys Micheal Winncott and Stephen McHattie. And Dr No himself, Joeseph Wiseman is great as crime czar and Luca mentor Manny Wiseboard.

The show's a classic, but it gets woeful DVD treatment with no extras and some pretty ordinary transfers. That doesn't matter because 'Crime Story' is so enjoyable and so good that any shortcomings in the presentation are easily forgiven.

Ironically 'Crime Story' is much better than Exec. Producer Micheal Mann's big hit of the time 'Miami Vice'.",1207872000,,2805,5.12253829321663

1916566,5,B0000CABIQ,"I used to love ""Crime Story"" when it was on TV and was both disappointed and disgusted when the show ended as it did (those of you who know, probably agree). Not since ""The Untouchables"" had a crime drama dealt with organized crime and the cops who bust them in such a compelling way. But where Robert Stack's Ness was stoic, straight, and incorruptable, Farina's Turillo is willing to do whatever it takes to nab his prey, blurring the line between who he is, a cop, and those whom he pursues, the criminal.

 Well, now I own the first season of the show and can enjoy it as much as I like. Watching it on DVD reminds me of how great the film really was, how it captured the mood of an era - and it just wasn't period music being played in the background.

Dennis Farina's cop against Anthony Dennison's hood is a great story of near epic proportions as Turillo's obsession in busting Ray Lucca finally consumes him. Thinking about it, could the series have ended any other way? (No, this is not a spoiler, consider it a tease).

What can I say? If you love crime dramas - this is the show for you. Even if you don't love crime dramas, you might find this a pleasant surprise. It's good TV, good story telling, and reminds one of what TV can do when it really tries.

This didn't help with ratings for this show(not to mention that the ongoing storyline with Luca was dropped, for a time, throughout the middle of the season). After nearly twenty years and finally seeing the whole first season, the kitschy dialogue is standard Michael Mann, with obvious plot builders to boot(Oh no! Luca's going to get Torello's pal now! Big shock!), annoying sexual relationships(the sooner Torello's wife was gone the better-as goes the same for his other love interests), no real character development(Torello is Torello and Luca is Luca by the final episode, with no character-developing dialogue or scenes throughout). ""Moonlighting"" definitely had the better writing when looking at these problems. Still, this is probably the more intriguing of the two. That period feel had to have cost this production some high dollar: the cars, backdrops, attire look fantastic!

The second and final season of producer Michael Mann's classic crime drama comes to DVD with all of the full-length episodes.  Details on the set are not yet known, but expect a similar type package to the first season release and the release date is tentatively set for the fall of 2005.  More details will be announced soon.",1103328000,9,364,4.65625
1916631,5,B0000CABIQ,"It was ahead of it's time,like most cult classics. Had it come out during the 70's when ""Chinatown"" was released or in the 90's when ""L.A. Confidential"" came out,it might've been on for at least for five seasons. As it is,it's a rare gem that is exciting,hard hitting,and carries the force of a baseball bat being wielded by a mafia hood!
  On the heels of his success in creating ""Miami Vice"",Michael Mann created this retro crime saga set in the early 1960's(pre-Kennedy assassination) and revolving around Chicago's elite ""M.C.U."" unit (sort of like the police department's own Untouchables) and their war against an up in coming mafia hood named Ray Luca.
  What makes Crime Story so interesting is not only it's retro style(classic cars,Luca's Elvis hairstyle,and early rock-n-roll) but the fact that much of the first season's stories are grounded in reality.
  First Off: The leader of the MCU,Lt. Michael Torrello,is based upon a real-life detective named Chuck Adamson(Who also is a script writer and consultant).Adding further weight is the fact that Torrello is played by Dennis Farina,who himself is a retired Chicago detective.
  Second: Ray Luca,played by Anthony Denison,is based upon real-life mafia hood Tony Spliroto,who also inspired the character of Nicki Santoro,played by Joe Pesci,in ""Casino"".By the same token,Ray's Las Vegas partner,Max Goldman,played by Andrew ""Dice"" Clay(!),was based upon Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal,who also inspired Robert DeNiro's Sam ""Ace"" Rothstien in ""Casino"".Indeed,as Luca rises to power from the streets of Chicago to Las Vegas,it is the story of Tony Spliroto. Additionally,Luca's mentor,Manny Weissborn,played by Joseph Wiseman(best remembered as the James Bond villan ""Dr. No""),is based upon one of the founding fathers of Organized Crime,Meyer Lansky.
  With it's roots in true crime,and with an great supporting cast that includes Ted Levine(""Buffalo Bill"" in ""Silence of the Lambs""),William Campbell(TV's ""Once and Again"" and ""The Rocketeer""),John Stanucci(A real life ""reformed hoodlum"" who plays Luca's side-kick),and Stephen Lang(""Ike Clanton"" in ""Tombstone"" as crusading attorney David Abrahms),and a great guest cast that includes Ving Rhames,Pam Greir,Deborah Harry(70's super-group ""Blondie""),and a very,very young Julia Roberts(playing a teen-aged victim of child molestation),""Crime Story"" is a kick butt series that blends hard hitting drama with exciting action,and well placed humor and a must have for any fan of the crime genre",1086048000,15,2497,5.652406417112299

This epic was actually misplaced on the small screen: it could have revived serials with weekly theatre runs.  The scaled down visuals and details were too limited to do the show justice.  Had cable been in 1986 what it is now, CRIME STORY would certainly have had a different look (i.e, THE SHIELD being the most obvious) and probably played even more brutal than it had.  Dennis Farina sets his own mark, but Lee Marvin's M-SQUAD Lt. Frank Ballinger, had to be in his subconscious (although Farina chewed his own share of real life Chi-Town cement with the CPD).

1916656,4,B0000CABIQ,"What can I say about Crime Story as a show that hasn't already been said here?  It was underrated in its day and still is.  So I'll keep this review focused on the DVD box set itself.
As an owner of the VHS box set that came out in the early '90s, I was really looking forward to a DVD version mainly for the better picture and sound quality.  I was not let down and this alone makes the set worth the price.  The picture is sharp and clean and the sound, although mono (remember, this is from the pre stereo TV days), is clear and free of chops and drop-outs.  Anchor Bay did a great job transferring the series to this medium.
About the only thing I can fault is the lack of extras.  There are no bonus features at all.  No interviews.  No original trailers/teasers.  No press photos.  Nothing.  Although the liner notes for the set are extensive with some really nice background info, it doesn't make up for the utter lack of extras that could have been included.
And one plea to Anchor Bay.  Back when the show was first on TV, New World produced a full video for the theme music.  I saw it a few times on late night TV and it was a bonus on the VHS version of a New World movie called The Demons.  When the season two box set is released, how about putting that on there?
Regardless of the lack of extra features, this is a wonderful collection of a wonderful series.  Whether you're a Crime Story fan or just looking for something to watch when the network shows are in reruns, do yourself a favor and grab this set.  You won't be disappointed.",1072656000,40,1550,4.22108843537415

1916658,5,B0000CABIQ,"Dennis Farina was a real-life Chicago cop, so maybe that is why he brings so much to this role.  He heads the task force of bringing down mobsters namely Ray Luca (Anthony John Denison - he took over for Ken Wahl in WISEGUY after Wahl was injured).  But there is a super supporting cast with Bill Smitrovich(Nero Wolfe) as Det. Danny Krychek, Steve Ryan as Det. Nate Grossman, Bill Campbell (very very young here!) as Det. Joey Indeli, and the brilliant Stephen Lang as Stephen Lang as Prosecutor David Abrams.  But the show was nearly stolen by Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) as Frank Holman and John Santucci as Pauli Taglia (a real life jewel thief at one time!).
Produced by Michael Mann (Miami Vice, Manhunter), you get the same attention to period detail and music.  The stories are fast action, with witty dialogue - like a drunken Farina tells a plump lady in a bar ""I'd like to strap you on and go rollerskating"".
This is Mann's genius at it's best with wonderful acting to keep you spellbound.",1072483200,15,1006,4.572222222222222
1916659,5,B0000CABIQ,"Crime Story is one of the finest crime dramas ever aired on network television bar none. This is the L.A. Confidential of television and then some! The cinematography, casting, acting, writing, painstaking attention to detail in rendering period authenticity, music, style...there's never been anything like it before or since. It holds up very well to repeat viewings even for those who don't like watching anything a second time. Until now, the only examples produced, have been various videotape releases, the domestic LD releases of both pilot and first 2 episodes, and the Japanese release of the entire first season (complete with subtitles). They all consist of dated, soft, low contrast, hazy transfers. None of them compare to this new Season One DVD Box Set in picture quality. The Pilot episode in this new set is sharper and smoother looking than previous releases (even the DVD), has excellent contrast with nice inky blacks, deep rich colors and a warmer look to it. The rest of the episodes have the same high contrast, deep blacks and saturated colors with adequate shadow detail. The dark and gritty look is by design, fitting to the film noir subject and not distracting in any way; and being DVD, clean clear freeze frames are rendered. This transfer is current and up to the minute.
As for audio, some have had their panties in a wad over replacement music. Expecting the worst, I did A/B comparisons between this set and older tapes of the series. Episodes compared were The Kingdom of Money (one of my favorites) and The War. Sequence for sequence from opening scene to closing credits both versions of The Kingdom of Money were virtually identical-not a single note of music was different (I suspect this is indicative of most of the episodes as well). When comparing both versions of The War, I found 2 or 3 sequences (non critical chase/action sequences) to have different dubs of incidental music, the original music having been indeed edgier and jazzier than the replacement music. But to be perfectly honest, if I weren't looking for the changes, I probably wouldn't have noticed them. All the rest of the major music was, like The Kingdom of Money, virtually unchanged. As with all productions which utilize large amounts of music, legal rights to all of it can be a problem. However, the negligable changes here have done nothing to dampen my enjoyment of this series. Certainly nothing to have a hissy fit about.
Season 2 while not as tightly knit as Season 1 is nevertheless very entertaining and it was nice to see the series expand in other directions. The Russian fighter pilot, for example, flying his MIG 21 to the United States to defect (Welcome to America!) was brilliant! There are some terrific stories here, some of which have further explored the depth of the characters. Yes I am very much looking forward to Season 2.
Rather than knocking Ancor Bay for this release as some have, I commend them for it. None of the previous releases of Crime Story had registered so much as a blip on the sales charts. Indeed, some may remember ambitious plans for an LD release of the entire series 2 episode volumes at a time starting with the pilot. This was abandoned after the pilot and first volume due to lack of interest. I think this was due to the release of individual episodes rather than complete season box sets but, nevertheless, for any studio to invest large amounts of cash in a high priced ""definitive"" version of a niche title without a track record would have been foolhardy. Ancor Bay (not a deep pockets studio) had a lot of guts to stick its neck out and bring us 2 complete seasons of a series it probably thought would have been a financial write off. They are either fans themselves or have shown an inordinate amount of consideration for those of us who are true Crime Story fans with this gift. I'm one of those who would rather have 85% of something than 100% of nothing. To be perfectly honest, I'm very disappointed in those ""fans"" out there who not only refuse to buy these sets, but recommend that others don't either. They will make very certain that a future ""definitive"" release of this show with completely restored original music (perhaps a Dolby Digital remix), a slick High Definition transfer, better packaging, lots of extras, commentary and perhaps even some chapter stops and an episode guide, will NEVER happen. My recommendation is, support this treasured work by buying this package for yourselves and as gifts for friends and family and support the studio that brought it to you as imperfect as you may think it is. I bought 2. Perhaps enough interest will be generated to warrent a future Revised Special Edition. In the meantime you will have a pristine archival representation of this classic show, which will never wear out or fall prey to laser rot, to hold on to and enjoy over and over until a better one is released.

Musically, this is a much better--and more respectful to the fans--set than WISEGUY Season One, which criminally omitted ""Nights in White Satin,"" that show's signature tune.  I'd also like to point out that this set includes an episode which does not appear on the Star Maker set: it's a flashback/clip show recounting the first 8 or 9 episodes, with 15 minutes of original scenes tacked on at the end.

1916663,1,B0000CABIQ,"I had been hoping that the DVD release of Crime Story would finally bring fans of the show a ""definitive"" release of this classic series. However, after borrowing the set from a friend (I did not shell out the $60, thank goodness) I was VERY disappointed in both the poor quality of the transfers (some of my original VHS copies look better!) and the replacement of the original music on many of the shows. I do not know if this was merely an error (using the wrong masters) or cheapness (going by the rest of the packaging and the mastering, it wouldn't surprise me) but this set is far from ""definitive"".
I'll hold on to my old VHS copies (as beat to hell as they are) and continue to wait for SOMEONE to treat these shows with the care they deserve. Meanwhile, anyone that is new to the show, you could pick this set up - the acting will stand up on its' own - but the overall quality and soundtrack mastering mistakes will prevent one from getting the exhilirating viewing experience of the original shows as they aired.
Also - as a long-time fan of the show since it originally aired - don't even bother with season two. In fact, cut your losses and stop watching after the next-to-last episode (""Top Of The World""). Everything after that is a mere cartoon charictarization and pale shadow of what came before it. The second season lost most of the orignal writers (and is an outright abomination), but that does not excuse the poorly-written ""season finale"" of season one (which plays out like it was written on a matchbook cover during lunch), especially following the excellent episode that preceeded it.",1069027200,26,1612,4.600694444444445

The fact that I have now purchased this DVD set says a great deal about my respect for the plot, the actors, the director, and just about everyone involved.
But the transfer to DVD is shockingly bad.  Apart from the image quality, which is a standard TV grain, they have replaced much of the original music.  This is most dramatic in episode four, ""The War,"" which used to have John Coltrane and Duke Ellington playing their classic, meditative version of ""In a Sentimental Mood"" and now features a studio saxophonist playing music that, at best, would be appropriate for a meaningless hot tub encounter.
The four-page booklet inside does not track the episodes--the only way to know what's included on each disk is to insert the DVD and check the menu--nor do the episodes include any chapter breaks.  Given what's possible now, this packaging is genuinely third rate.

7998355,3,B0000CABIQ,"An enjoyable crime series by Michael Mann, with excellent writing and acting, albeit with a generous dollop of cheesiness. It can be difficult sometimes to differentiate the 1963 Chicago setting with a 1983 studio set, particularly some of the environments and colors, and even some of the writing (the episode with the crazy antenna wire guy seemed like an unused Miami Vice episode more so than a 60's crime show plot.) Speaking of Vice, anyone who's watched MV will have a holiday picking out character after character from that series appearing in various roles here (as well as a few CSI spin-off leads, albeit in a much younger format).  And while the MV parallels are there, one notable distinction would be the lack of a Jan Hammer-quality score. The oldies songs work in the episodes, but the occasional, simplistic electronic music doesn't work. Not only doesn't it fit the style of the show (electronic music for a 60's cop show?) it's not very good, nor as thematic and driving as Jan Hammer's music was.
The show takes an interesting direction midway and suddenly all of the major characters are in Vegas, which to me is when the series seems to pick up and focus less on soapy sub-plots about bad vacation resorts and divorce.
But in general it's a good series with excellent acting, particularly that of Dennis Farina who completely drives the series. He was excellent as the crime boss Lombard in Vice, so it's fascinating to see him as the title character on the opposite side of the law in this series.
The final nuke was a little silly, and reminiscent of the end of the first series of goofy cop show 'Sledge Hammer'. I'm guessing the producers figured the show wasn't coming back again perhaps?",1449792000,,1715,4.75503355704698

7998358,4,B0000CABIQ,Entertaining to hear 60's music and see styles from my teen years.  Awesome seeing actors so young. Enjoyed Dennis and Tony especially .  Keep watching for others that are well known today. Acting a little hokee though but shows how techniques of filming have improved over the years.  Lot's of action.,1446508800,,302,4.882352941176471
