8695987,1,B00RVAB69G,"This film is all over the place with bad message and no strait facts. Just talking heads that give no good message. The only point is old personal opinions, do not go to the circus wear fur or go see a captive dolphin. All the circus in America and all the Dolphinariums in captivity only hold a few hundred animals total.  Fur us a larger issue but a fraction compared to chickens. We eat 25 million a day, cows pigs sheep millions more a day
The few animals in captivity that make millions of people love wildlife at Zoos Aqurium and  circus are not the REAL PROBLEM.  WHAT U BUY TO EAT THATS THE REAL PROBLEM. THIS FILM FALLS VERY SHORT IN MOST RESPECT FOR AMERICA TO MAKE REAL CHANGE.",1434153600,2,688,4.276923076923077
