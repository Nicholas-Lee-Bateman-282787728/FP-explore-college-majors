4948451,5,B0063RE4YW,"It holds your attention the entire time and really gives you a realistic glimpse into the options, or lack of, of ex-cons. A great writer/director leads a fantastic cast that makes this a great viewing experience. I could see it more than once!",1326499200,2,244,4.6976744186046515
4948452,5,B0063RE4YW,"Made on a shoe-string budget, giving a fresh twist to a old story about a change of heart, ""Few Options"" portrays a man and his environment in the 'noir' palette.  The portrait is compelling, the story well written, and the style lean and robust.  A fulfilling viewing experience.",1326499200,,280,4.8125
4948453,5,B0063RE4YW,I got a chance to enjoy this movie at a screening last year. It provides great insight into the psyche of an excon who was just released from prison and the troubles he has to go through when he tries to reenter society. Highly recommended!!!,1326499200,,242,4.4
4948454,4,B0063RE4YW,"This is a thoughtful, simmering drama about a man struggling to start over and do the right thing, with a strong yet nicely understated performance by Kenneth Johnson.  Rainn Wilson has a small but solid role as the cousin who reluctantly lets Frank live in his garage, so long as nobody can see him.  If you're tired of crime films with lots of action and little else, here's a grownup character-driven film with an engaging story.",1326240000,5,432,4.671052631578948
4948455,5,B0063RE4YW,"I saw this movie at the Valley Film Festival in November, and Few Options is an outstanding movie! The acting is fantastic, as Kenny Johnson is one of the best actors you will see anywhere. His performance takes an outstanding script and lifts it to an even higher level. Kenny delivers a riveting performance as Frank Connor, and the supporting cast is outstanding as well, with believable characters who quickly draw you into the movie. In short this movie is everything you want from a film: compelling and gripping story; deep characters, excellent production, and an outstanding musical score. It's a shame Few Options will not be released in theaters because this is one of the best movies you will see all year. George Pappy has put together a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat- and wanting to see more.",1326240000,2,827,4.710344827586207
4948456,5,B0063RE4YW,"""Few Options"" is a great crime drama that goes deep into the characters and tells an engaging story without compromising with any preconceptions about the genre. Definitely worth watching for the great performance by actor Kenny Johnson (Saving Grace) and a mature performance by Erin Daniels (L Word). The directing by novice director George Pappy is very precise and deserves the most kudos. A great indie that shows the darker side of L.A. life in the Valley.",1328140800,2,462,5.012987012987013

4948458,4,B0063RE4YW,"""Few Options"" offers a surprising story of a man getting out prison in early middle age.  Kenny Johnson gives a moving performance as a man who must remake his life for the very first time.  George Pappy delivers a deft script and direction in a first commercial effort, an impressive achievement. Original music and sound are amazing.  Also look for some surprises by several famous character actors performing to great effect in some key small roles.",1327276800,6,452,4.921052631578948
4948459,5,B0063RE4YW,"I enjoyed viewing this film. It's a confronting story and one riddled with toiling choices. It's well acted and directed. The characters are conflicting and gripping. I highly recommend this film, I just bought and will add it to my library for repeat viewing and sharing. I hope you do the same. It's called ""Few Options"".",1327104000,2,323,4.785714285714286
4948460,5,B0063RE4YW,"Few Options is a small budget film with a lot of emotional depth. Director George Pappy shows that with a good story and a powerful vision you can not only make a movie with heart but you can make it with a shoestring budget and nobody will notice the difference. I'm looking forward to what Mr. Pappy will do next. But it wasn't just the directing that made this film shine, the performances by the entire cast were wonderful. And the one that really deserves some attention is actor Kenny Johnson, who plays the lead as an ex-drug smuggler who is trying to mend his broken like. You must have seen Kenny Johnson in his numerous television performances over the years, which are always riveting, but he really spreads his wings in this role. If you are a fan of watching actors grow, take a look at his performance. It is heartfelt and real.",1327104000,3,842,4.474025974025974
4948461,5,B0063RE4YW,"This movie is fantastic. Few Options has a great cast of characters with a very real modern plot. Well written and well directed, this movie draws you in from the start, and keeps rockin until it blasts off at the end.",1326758400,,218,4.341463414634147
4948462,5,B0063RE4YW,"Well-acted and really well put together.  Engaging, emotional.  You care about the characters and what happens to them.  So many modern movies just go through the motions.  This one is intelligent, real, and worth the time.  Highly recommended.",1326672000,5,244,5.315789473684211
4948463,5,B0063RE4YW,"""Few Options,"" a film by emerging writer/director George Pappy, is one of those movie gems that can pop up unexpectedly from time to time - all the more affecting because audiences get to discover it for themselves without being force-fed by the Big Time film distribution system.  This passion project from a movie artist currently outside the mainstream was made with no budget but lots of guts and touching human insight.  Clearly, Pappy just said ""Damn the torpedoes!"" and shot his honest, fulfilling movie on credit cards.  But cheap here does NOT mean unsophisticated.  This is smart Film-Noir going back to its roots to tell an intense story from the point of view of an ex-con who lives in a murky world of moral ambiguity, no easy answers, and no way out.  Pretty much the human condition as we find it today.  Bravo, Mr. Pappy.  We eagerly await your next.",1326672000,9,866,4.733333333333333
4948464,5,B0063RE4YW,"I was drawn up in to the story from the beginning, talk about a character driven plot which took an almost eastern perspective in learning to deal with a constant torrent of life's vicissitudes; Kenny Johnson gives a solid performance as an ex con trying to escape a sociopathic gang boss played very effectively by Brad Dourif. Rainn Wilson demonstrates a range of talent that was unexpected as a spineless cousin making me wish he would show up in more straight dramatic roles diverging from his usual comic characters. Impressive well written and directed script with a great cast, good music and compelling performances made me glad I saw this one at the Valley Film Festival.",1326499200,2,680,4.870689655172414
4948465,5,B0063RE4YW,"Easily one of the bright points of micro-budget independent films I've seen in a long time. And the actors don't sleep walk their parts- each owns their character. Never a moment of drag, Kenny Johnson is perfectly cast.",1326499200,2,220,4.815789473684211
8492167,3,B0063RE4YW,The movie itself was just OK. It was nice to see David Marciano in the movie...deja vu the Shield with the two of them. The plot was predictable.  But I'll watch Kenny Johnson in almost anything.  Did not understand the purpose of the Rain Wilson character.,1477785600,,257,4.565217391304348
8492168,4,B0063RE4YW,It isn't Oscar worthy but it kept my interest.,1476230400,,46,4.222222222222222
8492169,5,B0063RE4YW,"Exceeded my expectations,very engaging script and interesting ending!",1474329600,,69,7.75
8492170,4,B0063RE4YW,"Not bad for a low budget independent film. Not much action, but pretty good character development.",1474070400,,98,5.1875
8492171,5,B0063RE4YW,"This movie was GREAT! Well written, great dialogue and the acting was superb. Kenny Johnson was very perfect for this role. There are some great cameo's by actors I love like Laura San Giacomo. I read that this movie was done with a small budget and I admire that. It takes real talent to make a movie these days without a big studio or lots of investors behind you and to have it come out so well. It kept my interest the whole time and I am known for walking out of or turning off a movie if it's not keeping my attention. The Director did an amazing job. He also did the movie Green Girl and he has a lot of talent. I am waiting for his next movie for sure. Watch it. You won't be sorry.",1441843200,,690,4.007246376811594
8492172,5,B0063RE4YW,"Love the movie, the plot, the actors, the action, but my DVD was so dark, it was hard to see.  Can I return it and get another copy.",1405382400,,132,3.7142857142857144
8492173,4,B0063RE4YW,"I Just recently had the fortune to see the movie ""Few Options"" and must say I was pleasantly surprised. It was a really good movie. I first was drawn to it by seeing Kerry Johnson was the lead actor who we all remember from that great show ""The Shield"" so I had to give it a shot. Now I don't remember everybody's names but I will tell why I thought the movie was so good:

1. The Story: although this story has been told many times,the writer/director Mr. Pappy Jr. did an excellent and refreshing job with the script with a surprise ending to boot which was great.
2. Whoever is responsible for the soundtrack gets an A+ because it was great and unusual and I love the fact that they did not use household named artist.
3. The tempo and flow of the story was just great.
4. This is an unusal one: All the actors/actresses did a great job!
5. Once again,that surprise ending was the icing on the cake! Very unusual,different and I must applaud the thought that went into it!",1363996800,3,975,4.298913043478261
8492174,3,B0063RE4YW,"Positives: Well acted, written, directed and filmed.

Negatives: A bit too many formula characters i.e. convenient role stereotypes of friends, relatives, prostitutes over-the-top bad guys and the following:
(a.) A story that's been told too many times of someone leaving prison after being the fall guy for others in a crime gone bad.
(b.) Usual social and bureaucratic hurdles in adjusting to civilian life.
(c.) The usual low paying job resulting in having to take on another criminal task in order to survive.
(d.) Predictable criminal task, his targets and his decision making outcome.
(e.) Filmed mostly in a garage and parking lot. Although, in defense of the writer/director, the story largely revolves around the decisions of our lead character so settings are not as critical to the story.",1338076800,,799,5.1937984496124034
8492175,5,B0063RE4YW,"Writer/Director George Pappy has managed to push his way through the overflowing flood of today's worthless,
exploitative offerings in the name of movies, and shows us it can be done. Compromise is not the name of the game; hard work and talent is.  Do you need  a truckload of dough to start with?  No, not when you're armed with the abilities of actors like Kenny Johnson, Erin Daniels and Brad Dourif. All you need is the guts to make a hard-hitting, forcefully original film that inadvertently links us to the quality offerings of yesterday.  You can sigh, take a breath, real film-making isn't dead yet.  Kenny Johnson's performance is stunning in its subtle yet forceful understanding of everything there is to know about the character he portrays, and then he delivers incredible surprises.  Everyone in the cast is superb. Pappy's direction is intriguing and flawless.  The film does not compromise but drives its relentless theme with the force of a hammer on the head of a nail.  A great job.  A daring, new kind of classic!",1336262400,7,1034,4.829545454545454
8492176,5,B0063RE4YW,"Saw this on ""Showtime"" tonight by accident.

Few Options... what an unexpected masterpiece. Earlier reviews are impressively close to my opinion. All the elements of the film amazed me. I would hate to compare it to any movie that I have loved over the past several decades. So I will just mention movies that connected with me in similar ways. How about crime classics with Humphrey Bogart; the films of John Sayles and Jim Jarmusch. The ""Deadwood"" series on HBO worked its way with me in a similar manner. ""In the Heat of the Night"" has affected me every year since the 1960's. ""Few Options"" will be burning in my brain for the rest of my life. Our inhuman prison system and our unfinished justice system could not be better displayed. Thanks to everyone who worked on this movie.",1335139200,4,782,4.625899280575539
