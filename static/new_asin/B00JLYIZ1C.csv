6381505,4,B00JLYIZ1C,"Hollis Wallace (Michael Beach) drives a ""creepy child molester's""  pick-up truck as peruses through neighborhoods hauling away scrap metal for profit. He lives at home caring for his mother (Jennifer Lanier).  As he cruises the neighborhood, mostly from the alley, he gets to see a lot of things including Ray (Aiden Gillen) who is into S&M bondage... ""America's 7th most popular fetish."" One of his paid Craig's List playmate is Swan (Anna Giles) a barely 18 year old girl.

Swan coaxes her way into Hollis' life, a life that is in a rut except for the vivid dreams caused by his patch.

The film was done well with good performances. Worth a view for Indie lovers.

6381506,5,B00JLYIZ1C,"I didn't expect this movie to get to me as deeply as it did. It was poignant and funny at the same time, and I ended up caring about the main characters (the Michael Beach and Anna Giles characters) a lot. It was quirky, too, which I love in a movie. Very original, definitely not a cookie-cutter.",1400371200,,297,4.228070175438597

8652275,4,B00JLYIZ1C,"Enjoyed this movie. Sometimes indies can be hit or miss, but this one was actually good. Michael Beach is always excellent, and his costar was intriguing. Good supporting cast (mayor from The Wire, and a few other minor actors). Good story and plot that keeps you involved. Started off slowly, but was increasingly better as the movie went on.",1495670400,,343,4.830508474576271

A man trying to survive, take care of his mom, and be a Good Man.  A girl on the move, a butterfly.  The two meet.
Very realistic movie.  Lovely.
I know too many people just scraping by - just like this...",1426377600,,239,4.0212765957446805

8652281,5,B00JLYIZ1C,"I was drawn to this mostly because of Michael Beach and Aiden Guillen ~ It was a little slow for me at first and I was a wee bit shocked (when I didn't think I could be shocked anymore) by some reason of the scenes with Aiden ~  As I went on I realised they were not gratuitous, but a serious part of the movie ~ I highly recommend this ~ You will enjoy the slow ride and be grateful you went ~",1421020800,,394,3.746987951807229
