4897749,5,B005VU9KIM,Good set. It was more than I expected and extremely educational as well as entertaining.  Mostly just photos of national parks along with soft music.,1388188800,,149,4.96
4897750,5,B005VU9KIM,Perfect for my travel-loving husband who also reveres the National Parks. It was a hit! So glad I found this.,1387929600,,109,4.5
4897751,5,B005VU9KIM,"Since this is for Christmas  it hasn't been opened yet.
However we enjoy traveling Route 66 and love to visit National Parks so it's a no-brainer gift!",1387065600,,151,4.592592592592593
4897752,3,B005VU9KIM,Nice presentation and a good price. However the documentaries are a bit short and not always straight to the point.,1375574400,3,115,4.8
4897753,4,B005VU9KIM,"This box set is a combo set of ""Route 66 Marathon Tour Chicago to L.A."" and ""America the Beautiful"" that are already sold separately on Amazon. So you save when you buy the two together. For the fans, there are lots of other DVDs on Route 66 and National Parks, so compare before purchasing.",1368057600,4,291,4.407407407407407
4897754,5,B005VU9KIM,"These DVD's were not exactly what we thought but were
very informative as to motels, restaurants, etc. along
Route 66 ~~~~~ so ~~~ we're glad we have the DVD's.",1351555200,,160,4.551724137931035
4897755,3,B005VU9KIM,"I bought this set in anticipation of a vacation next year along Route 66. I had hoped to find interesting places along the way, tidbits of information, etc. I did get some of that, but it was mostly too-long interviews with people along the way essentially saying the same thing over and over. Toward the middle of the Route 66 set, things got a little better and I thought maybe it just got off to a slow start, but then the long, repetitive interview format resumed toward the end of the series. The parts I found interesting could have been condensed down into a single 60 or 90 minute DVD.

We haven't watched all of the National Parks DVDs yet. The same extremely long introduction begins each segment. Mostly pictures, very little information. Video quality is okay from a distance, but if you get up close to the TV screen you can tell that it was filmed with very low resolution.

All in all, I regret my purchase.",1351209600,19,922,4.482142857142857
8487646,1,B005VU9KIM,This product is a joke because of the many inaccuracies and poor descriptions of the pictures and videos shown. For example the narration of Zion talks about elk and the pictures are all of mule deer. Several instances like this on each DVD.,1456444800,,241,4.627906976744186
8487647,1,B005VU9KIM,????? This is trash. trash trash trash.,1423267200,,39,4.714285714285714
8487648,5,B005VU9KIM,It was a gift.,1421020800,,14,2.75
8487649,5,B005VU9KIM,"Route 66 is my husband's ""passion"".  He really enjoyed watching these DVDs.  Great evening pastime.",1419811200,,99,5.533333333333333
8487650,2,B005VU9KIM,"If you like some personal stories from people about Rt. 66 which I do this DVD will entertain you. If you look to this as something to use to plan your Rt. 66 trip forget it. They skipped over dozens or sites of interest in Illinois. This made it seem like you visit Lou Mitchell's for breakfast in Chicago, then White Fence farms for lunch then another just a little east and north of St. Louis  for supper then you are done with Illinois. Nothing about the Gemini Giant or the Rt. 66 welcome center in Joliet. Nothing about a historic gas station along the way. I would give it three stars myself because I have plenty of quality travel guides to Rt. 66 and enjoy the home spun stories but I think most buying this set for Rt. 66 would call it a two star set.",1407283200,,761,4.1768707482993195
8487651,4,B005VU9KIM,"This is really two different DVD sets in one package.  Route 66, which I do find interesting is one, and the National Parks, which I'm a huge fan of is the other.  They even come in two different packs.  The 66 portion focuses more on the eastern part, and to me the more interesting part is more New Mexico to Barstow, not Illinois the Texas section.  Still kind of interesting if you like this sort of thing.  And the National Parks are the Parks, something I'm very fond of, but not the best coverage of them.  So why a 4 star rating?  Price.  Again, if you enjoy this sort of thing, there is a lot here for the money, even if it's just so so.  If I'd paid what the list price once was the rating would be much lower.",1396051200,,720,4.085714285714285
8487652,5,B005VU9KIM,"I have not looked at the whole series but plan to as time permits.  So far, I am well pleased with what I have seen and feel that it was well worth the money.",1389830400,,158,3.6470588235294117
8487653,1,B005VU9KIM,"Slow,boring,not informative. Could not even watch was to boring.  It goes several minutes with no spoken words. Do not buy if you want to plan a trip",1389052800,,149,4.518518518518518
8487654,3,B005VU9KIM,Too many long winded interviews.  Haven't watched the entire series because it made me fall asleep. I was very interested in the subject but could not stay interested in the movie.,1388361600,,180,4.806451612903226
8487655,1,B005VU9KIM,"Now... I'm not going to say many of those 5 star reviews are bogus. I'd just suggest you look at the number of 5 star reviews on this edition with a single sentence and the number of reviews on the previous edition that aren't even from verified purchasers, then make up your own mind.

OK let's start with the good...... Wait gimme a minute.... Oh yeah these guys got to write off their whole vacation because they filmed it and offered their home movies for sale. That's the best I can say. (more on this later)

There is so much 'bad' I'm not even sure where to start:

The box proudly states it was ""Filmed in HD"" and I'm sure it was. Then they down sampled it to DVD quality using a horrendous codec and the video  is just awful. And the editing....  Well, technically I can not complain about the editing because there basically was none.

The 'interviews' that people complain about being too long are not actually interviews. They sat the owners of these establishments down and had them recite all the various dates associated with the property into a camera then showed it unedited without even a single camera cut. Imagine a high school kid interviews grandparents about life during WWII. --- Put the camera on the tripod and hit record.

Above I compared it to a home movie. That wasn't just a random insult. It really is basically these guys home movie. And if you like that kind of thing well, this is probably not the worst you'll see... Just know going in that this isn't a professional production. (This ain't no Discovery Channel or TLC)

I could go on... goodness knows they did for 10 hours... suffice it to say I can count on one hand the number of items I've returned to Amazon because I was not pleased with the quality. This is officially one of them.

Save yourself the trouble, find a better set.

EDIT: OH my bad, the music was decent.",1388188800,,1862,4.466076696165191
