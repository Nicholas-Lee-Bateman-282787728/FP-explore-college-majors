8243866,5,B00124SNFW,"1. Pilates for flexibility:
I really like this stretch video especially after a long bicycle ride. Amy Brown leads you through a 20 min session and 2 workout levels are included (beginners and intermediate). There is both a beginner and intermediate level using the same routine.

I really like the pace and amount of time Amy holds the stretches. She includes some hamstring stretching that I have not seen in other videos. Lying on your back and stretching one leg up, she first has you point your toe out and stretch across, then point your toe in and stretch across. This is one of the best techniques I have found to stretch the outside of my leg from hip to ankle, a place that get very tight for me with the amount of exercising I do and especially after riding my bike.

She includes a variety of my favorite stretches, mostly laying down and sitting. Arm circles, bridge, lunges, twists, side bends, and neck stretch. She has a very pleasant voice and doesn't talk too much. I highly recommend this video as part of your exercise regime.

2. Pilates on the Ball
This is not a hard-core workout DVD, but a wonderful easy-to-follow overall routine. Amy Grant leads a well-paced workout when you're short on time and want an easy, fun workout. I like the balance ball workout because you really work your abs without even realizing it! You can either follow the beginner or intermediate routine provided on the DVD. There is some nice mellow music included with the routine.

I use both DVDs over and over again and I can't wait to try her others! Check their website at pilatesforlife.ca",1237075200,,1594,4.641843971631205
