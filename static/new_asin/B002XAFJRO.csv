Typical French movie.  A long time to tell about nothing.  Also had hard time getting DVD to play the movie.  Did it have the usual main menu and start playing the movie?  No, it kept playing a preview over and over.  Finally got to play the movie but don't know what I did to do it.  Very strange menu setup.",1363305600,,319,4.147540983606557
