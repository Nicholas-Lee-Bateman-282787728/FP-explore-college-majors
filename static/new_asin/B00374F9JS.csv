4080222,4,B00374F9JS,"It is really a very good movie. The acting is of very high quality; the storyline is smart and realistic. You know there is something more than what seems to be throughout the movie without knowing where the director is taking you until the end. Why not 5 stars then? I think that they could have gone even deeper. May be editing restrictions rendered the end product a bit too superficial at time to my liking, especially for such a serious matter. I prefer not to get into any specific details as it could spoil it for the readers.",1387238400,12,533,4.393939393939394
4080223,4,B00374F9JS,"I'm absolutely not diminishing the nightmare of losing a child to a predator, which I find unthinkably horrific. But from a cinephile perspective - how many productions like this have followed what is now the 'formula' for these types of films? I can think of something like a half dozen movies and countless tv programs which are cut from the same bit of dramatic cloth, including the ubiquitous twist. If a filmmaker is going to go this route, you tend to hope for something fresh, creatively or via&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-different-perspective/dp/B004SIP7XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a different perspective</a>.

However, I was pleasantly surprised at the director's choice of revealing the truth earlier in the film. It's not a particularly difficult plot to decrypt, so it gave strength to the remaining story, adding tension and urgency when it was needed.

It's Dujardin's subdued and compelling performance alone that closes the gap between so-so average to watchable in an otherwise boilerplate effort.

Personal Note:

- Before anyone gets it in their head that I'm some bandwagon jumper who only recognizes thespian skill by virtue of common proclamation, note that I&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-found-Dujardin-for-myself-back-in-May-2011/dp/B001UI8KV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first found Dujardin for myself back in May 2011</a>; more than half-a-year before 'The Artist' was even released into the US market.

In fact, in June of that year, the eventual Oscar winner had just finished its very first screening at Cannes. And if I could afford to be in France to watch a film festival - would I be renting videos? <g>",1332288000,2,1741,6.004032258064516
4080224,5,B00374F9JS,"The reviews for ""Contre enqute"" are excellent, plus it stars Jean Dujardin, whom I'd like to see in a different kind of film.  He was terrific in THE ARTIST.

BUT...does this French film have ENGLISH SUBTITLES?  The Amazon description does not say.

Thanks.",1332201600,4,257,4.906976744186046
4080225,4,B00374F9JS,"One of those too-few procedurals that has an interesting and somewhat original storyline: here the reveal is logical and understated, not some thrown-in and sensational last-second impossibility. And despite the highly emotive and destructive nature of the crime, the performances are measured and affecting. Jean Dujardin continues to prove his versatility, demonstrating nuance and restraint in his portrayal of an ordinary man seeking an unordinary path to retribution. By never becoming theatrical, the actors create a plausible, credible world inhabited by people feeling their way through the tragic events, rather than raging in certainty. There are a few seemingly unavoidable and clich moments (why is that superiors in crime dramas are ALWAYS saying something like ""Okay, you have two more days""? )  but the overall direction clearly worked towards a level of realism. Still, as we watch the story unfold from scene to scene the direction falters in some obvious ways. Most of the shots are blocked in a very familiar, made for TV style, failing to elevate the visual presence to the same level as the narrative's originality. The art direction seems pretty satisfied with the familiar too, but with Paris as the set one might expect something at least as well realized as Branagh's ""Wallander"" episodes in establishing a predominating sense of mood and place. ""Contre Enquete"" is still a good, engaging film -- but to be more memorable it needed Melville or Bresson or perhaps even Corbijn in the director's chair.",1298160000,7,1525,5.25

4080229,5,B00374F9JS,"This is a first rate crime mystery-thriller beginning with the originality of the story, truly superb direction of misdirection, some very cool acting (the French make some extraordinary crime thrillers such as ""Spiral""), and with a very gratifying outcome. The last line wallops with the sense of loss that oft lurks in the shadows of our fragile selves. By far, the better of the two films of this specific story line the other being ""7 Days"" (2010) with  Claude Legault and Rmy Girard, Don't miss this one.",1421107200,2,509,4.850574712643678

4080232,5,B00374F9JS,"A good movie - but very painful.  Jean Dujardin's character is a police officer who deals with drugs.  When a snitch calls him on his day off with his daughter for help, he leaves her at home while he handles the problem -- only to receive a call that turns his world upside down. He and his wife sit through the trial of the man who has been captured for the girl's abduction and murder.  Only, after finding some additional information, he starts to work for the prisoner's release.

There is a stunning twist at the climax of the movie, which adds to the sadness of the movie.",1412294400,6,579,4.333333333333333

4080235,5,B00374F9JS,"This is a fine mystery film. I am biased in favor of European films that still spend effort  on character development instead of silly action, fast car chases, and mechanical evils. This film satisfies by slowly unraveling and fine plot with a superlative ending. Dujardin does admirable work in this film and the person playing the perpetrator is excellent as well.",1409011200,6,366,5.0
8390281,3,B00374F9JS,"This had the feel of a low-budget cable movie. Pretty much everything is a setup for the twist and as such it is too deliberate and obvious. It was also rushed, with major plot developments coming and going as if inconsequential, again because all this script wanted to do was get everything in place for the ending.",1467072000,2,316,4.56140350877193

When I select a French film, especially one that stars Laurent Lucas, I expect something different and better than this Lifetime-quality movie. It wasn't his finest work. The plot was trite and predictable. The writing amateurish. The characters were flat. Watch Lucas in the film ""Lemmings"" and you'll see him at his best. The other actors, I've never seen before - probably for good reason.",1450915200,2,440,4.95945945945946
