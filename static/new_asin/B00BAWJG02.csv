8564962,5,B00BAWJG02,"The product arrived early.  At first, the discs did not work on two of my devices.  But when I played them on my laptop, they worked beautifully.  I'm having through the disc and for the first time, I'm actually grasping (or think I'm grasping) the concepts of Statistics.  Thank you Jason Gibson!",1484265600,,297,4.653846153846154
8564963,5,B00BAWJG02,"I own most of Jason's DVD sets (aside from the very basic math sets and his Java programming sets).  Some I have purchased through Amazon, and some through his website directly.  I am back in school to get an electrical engineering degree.  Next fall I have to take data analysis, which is basically applied statistics, with a teacher who does not have a great reputation, so I purchased all the volumes in this set, plus his original probability and statistics tutor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Probability-and-Statistics-Tutor-10-Hour-Course-3-DVD-Set-Learn-By-Examples/dp/B0016G8HX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Probability and Statistics Tutor - 10 Hour Course - 3 DVD Set - Learn By Examples!</a>, to get the basics down before I take the class.

This volume covers the basics/core concepts of statistics.  There is a little bit of overlap with his older DVD set, because while that one focused on probability some of the principles from statistics are used in probability and vice versa.  So things like histograms, mean and standard deviation, and variance will all be refresher concepts if you have the old set.  But he does get into a lot of new material, some are definitions like Sample and Population which he did not really get into before, the various types of plots and charts, and things like Quartiles and the various theorems that are applicable only to statistics.  So it is definitely not a double dip if you have the older set.

Like all his other DVD sets, Jason covers everything in a step-by-step manner.  The new layout for his DVDs have been to introduce the concept in one section and then do example problems in the subsequent section(s) on that topic to keep the individual sections of the DVD shorter.  In his older sets it was not uncommon to have hour plus long sections, which could get to be a bit much if you attempted to watch the entire thing at once.  In this set the longest overall section was right under a half hour.  He rarely, if ever skips any steps in the problems he works through (I don't think he ever skipped any in this set), and even when he does he warns you ahead of time.

Learning style is different for everyone, but I find the way he explains concepts be it in math, physics, chemistry or engineering are very easy to follow, and much better than some of the free material that you can find out there.  It is basically a video lecture though, not unlike sitting in a class lecture, but generally more condensed and focused on problems more than overall theory.  So if it is a fit for your learning style, and you are taking any kind of statistics class, I would highly recommend this.",1465257600,,2695,4.942350332594235
8564964,5,B00BAWJG02,"I was overwhelmed with my statistics class and decided to purchase this DVD, this was a total life saver. Jason explains everything in such detail. This DVD is worth every penny and will help you succeed in your statistics class.",1446508800,,229,4.75
8564965,5,B00BAWJG02,"Excellent DVD series.  I complained that the DVD Vol. 1 didn't contain confidence intervals and hypothesis testing (To Mr. (Dr.?) Gibson on his website). Then, as if he personally listened to little 'ol me, he completely covered EVERYTHING in detail on 2 and 3. The whole Stat series is a must for any entry level College course.  The website is pretty great too. My son was taking High school Algebra at the same time, and for only $20. a month you can be a member. It is month to month so no contract and you get 24 hour unlimited access. This is the way to go if you have numerous family members taking different math courses or if you're taking several at once. Jason was a God - send for my family.",1434153600,2,703,4.318181818181818

in a clear manner that most people will understand. My experience
with the use of these products up to this point has been
exceptional and I would recommend to purchase for learning.",1393113600,4,242,4.651162790697675
8564969,5,B00BAWJG02,This DVD starts with the basics and builds in a very logical way to more advanced concepts. I tried statistics once in college and hated it. I thought it was so hard. Now with this DVD class it makes sense!,1388620800,5,206,4.175
8564970,5,B00BAWJG02,"I am currently taking a Statistics class at college.  The ""Mastering Statistics, Vol 1"" DVD set has made learning the concepts in this class so much faster and easier. I am averaging a 97% so far, because of these tutoring DVDs.
I also purchased the ""Mastering Statistics, Vol 2,"" and I am waiting for the Vol 3 to come out this fall (2013).

Jason Gibson is the instructor, and he does an awesome job; I can't say enough about his teaching. I do own other MathTutor DVDs, and have been happy with them all. I highly recommend the MathTutor DVDs.",1380499200,7,546,4.45
