8709521,5,B00V7ORRIG,Cute and sweet anime for fans of the Atelier series.,1523059200,,52,4.3
8709522,5,B00V7ORRIG,"I assume most people interested in this will either be fans of anime or the Atelier game series, so the best way I can describe it is Cute Girls, Best Friends Forever: the RPG, with slice-of-life on the side. That's actually probably how I'd describe most of the Atelier games, actually.

If that doesn't pique your interest, or if you aren't into the Atelier series already, you may not enjoy this quite as much as I did.

The stories aren't quite so grim and serious as many (J)RPGs often opt for, but rather, they tend to be smaller-scale adventures of importance to the protagonist, like finding a lost family member, or perhaps fulfilling a childhood dream like Escha.

In the end, they're stories about relatively normal girls who refuse to give up on their seemingly out-of-reach dreams. In a way, it's a great message to all of us; we don't need to be royalty or disgustingly rich, but we all probably have some small dream or wish that we feel is slightly out of reach, but in reality is certainly achievable.

Even the side characters, some of which who come across as disagreeable at first, often have their own special likeable ""charm points"". Meeting the characters may make you wish you had friends just as great, or at least wish for a world where people were a little less terrible to one another.

This anime is unique in that it follows fairly closely (but not exactly) to the game's storyline, so it makes a splendid companion to the game -- you can play/watch either in sequence, or play/watch both simultaneously, chapter by chapter to see how things play out. Even if events are the same, it's still a joy to see the characters come to life in the anime version, displaying actions and events not quite possible within the budgetary and technical limits of the game engine.

It's something I'd love to see done with other games, especially future (and past) Atelier series. Sadly, I don't think Escha sold as well as her parent companies would've liked.

The art quality is sadly a bit dodgy during minor scenes, making it look like those were handed off to an animation farm or interns. However, the characters still shine through the scenario writing and the extremely talented voice actors, who play the same roles in both the game and anime.",1496966400,,2267,4.680904522613066

8709526,5,B00V7ORRIG,"nice to watch some alchemy, based on a Japanese Video game, you will see references in the series pointing to the Game",1454716800,,118,4.409090909090909
8709527,3,B00V7ORRIG,"I enjoyed this anime!
The mid episode scenes would give you a picture of a character and include a few trivial stats: age, height & blood type.  My problem is that this information was either poorly placed or the side edges of the screen had been cropped, as you couldn't read the blood types for all of the characters.  The fear of the possibility that the edges of the screen had been cropped affected my rating for this product by 1 star.
Otherwise it was a fun series to watch and would like a second season to the series (even if it were to follow a different game)!",1447459200,,571,4.277777777777778

8709530,4,B00V7ORRIG,"As far as the Blu-Ray NOT having an English Dub included (although Escha's voice is cuter that way), I actually found the anime adaptation of the game I played to be enjoyable. There some moments where Escha and Logix were embarrassed during their first impressions, the part where a magic replica of Escha's tail accessory turning people into feline hybrids, etc. And of course, the second most obvious part is that the picture is vibrant and smooth like ice cream. We also see Escha's late mother that kinda resembled Megurine Luka from ""Vocaloid"" in a few flashbacks. The bonus features involve textless opening/closing credits and little trailers.

If you've played the game and don't mind only the original audio, then you gotta check it out! :)

  (SPOILER WARNING)

(UPDATE: 8/10/2015): I saw the ending and only half of it was the same as the game. While Escha normally went off with someone else in the game, she didn't do anything besides seeing Logy off.",1437609600,8,965,4.859756097560975
