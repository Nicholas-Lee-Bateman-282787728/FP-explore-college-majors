3555318,4,B001EKP5E6,"Loved Awakenings, liked Survivors, but couldn't get more than a quarter way through Fisher King.  DeNiro and Williams in Awakenings is pure genius.  Williams and Walter Matheau in Survivors was fun.  Worth buying.",1408665600,,213,5.393939393939394
3555319,5,B001EKP5E6,"Excellent.  Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors.  He has the ability to make you laugh, cry, think, and especially feel emotions.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about him - he does not get enough credit for his acting talent.",1392336000,,240,4.666666666666667
3555320,5,B001EKP5E6,"""Awakenings"" & ""The Fisher King"" were great movies; too bad about ""The Survivors"". Good actors can have poor performances - witness Williams and Matthau here. Interesting introduction of survivalists/preppers from three decades ago. As an aside, GENEL originally sent a mislabeled DVD - but happily replaced it. Thanks to them a one star experience improved to five star!",1369872000,,371,5.413793103448276
3555321,4,B001EKP5E6,"Great combination of movies, the only negative I would say is that the volume on the ""Awakenings"" DVD is far quieter than the other 2 infact have to have the volume up 100% to hear it.
Quick delivery, well packaged item and would recommend the seller!",1362960000,,251,4.478260869565218
3555322,5,B001EKP5E6,"Awakenings and The Fisher King are great movies. To be honest I had never heard of The Survivors but it wasn't a bad movie, just not as good as the first two in this set.  Still, you've got to love Robin Williams. I also had a soft spot for the first two movies as I used to work in a NYS psychiatric hospital in the 1980's and, having lived most of my life on Long Island, I've spent some time in NY City too.",1362960000,,410,3.880952380952381
3555323,3,B001EKP5E6,"Although the first two movies were good (not great ""Awakenings"" & ""The Fisher King""), even Walter Matthau and Robin Williams couldn't keep this one going.",1361145600,,154,5.2
3555324,3,B001EKP5E6,"I have not watched all three DVD's yet, but the case was full wrapped in plastic, & the discs themselves do not appear to have an scratches or marks on the playing surface. They appear to be in much better shape then the listed condition of ""good"" & the first movie of the three I did watch, Awakenings, had no play back problems.
The disappointment I had was upon opening the disc case, all three disc are stacked on top of each other, rather then having a middle insert so each one could have its own slot.
The movies are stand alone with no special features, which I knew they would be.
I was originally just looking for a copy of The Fisher King, but this seemed like a better deal, & I got what I paid for, & the aspect ratio is the same or better then they single versions of the three movies.
If your are not someone who needs the best possible version of a movie, I would recommend this for purchases. You're getting three movies for the equivalent of $4.33 each.
I just wish the discs where not stacked on top of each other.
That is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4. If Amazon would let me I would have given it 3.5, but they don't seem to want to allow half ratings.",1350172800,2,1178,4.126086956521739
