8475953,2,B005JRZEOQ,"I am very disappointed in the History Channel, and I am glad I didn't pay the $300 they were asking for this series.  I bought this set to use for my 6th and 8th graders to go with their Ancient History for the state standards of CA.  I am also a major history fanatic when it comes to ancient history and the history of religions. I need to lay out the standards first, so you will see why I say this is biased in how the History Channel is now trying to ""change"" history to their point of view.  Now mind you CA may have different standards than other states, but I also looked into Virginia's state standards, so I could see from a state who doesn't use ""no child left behind"", and is on the other side of the states, what their standards are for this subject.  I will present both, and then lay out the sequence that this History Channel video series presents.  And just so you know, I am neither Christian, nor Jewish, nor Islamic, just so you don't think that I am also biased.

Okay, so now you have a foundation for the timeline of History.  Which things happened first, second and so on.  This is how history has been written and taught since the beginning of History.

Anyways, I think that if you are going to make a History series, then it should be accurate,and accurate to the timeline of History.  I am giving it 2 stars because the programs are decent, and I will use them in the order that they should be in, but again, I am very disappointed in the layout of this series, and the fact that relevant data is not even included in the timeline.  I spent $70 on it, not the $300 that the History Channel wants, but if you are looking to teach students with it, I would be very careful, and at least have all of the information before you decide. Because you can't see the back of every case, and the Titles make it deceptive to ancient history.",1345593600,23,13089,5.588627049180328
