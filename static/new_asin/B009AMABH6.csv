I might know what that was if I'd have read the book, but that shouldn't be prerequisite for seeing a movie.
This film is a waste of time, if was painful to slog through to the end; don't bother, there's no satisfaction waiting at the end of the tunnel, cut your losses and spend your time more wisely, cut your fingernails.",1349827200,11,366,4.318840579710145

There are many, many interpretations of what goes on and I believe that you have to see it for yourself to determine what it means to you. That being said, I had great conversation afterwards trying to decide just what I thought it portrayed, and I came up with several. I will finally just say that this is definitely one that I will purchase so that I can watch and re-watch it. And I'm sure that every time I see it I will come up with something different. THAT's what makes this a great movie to me! The acting, especially by Robert Pattinson, was absolutely phenomenal. The ensemble actors were all wonderful though and each brought something very different to the movie. I can't wait until this becomes available - I will be first on the list and suggest that you get on that list as well!!",1348185600,72,878,4.392638036809816

I read this book when Robert Pattinson signed on to the project, and to be honest, I didn't like it on the first reading. It grew on me by the second reading, but the movie made me love it. One of the challenges Cosmopolis faces is that it's impossible complete the phrase, ""The moral of the story is...."" and so many people, me included, dislike things that can't be easily defined.  I've seen interviews with David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson where they say that it is impossible to tell you what they story is about, but don't make the mistake of thinking that it's about nothing, it's just about open to so many interpretations that it's impossible to pin down.  I'll give you mine, but rest assured that if you don't like what I see, chances are you'll see something else entirely anyway.

The story, in it's most basic form, is about Eric Packer's limo ride across the crowded city to get a haircut.  He encounters various people and scenarios along the way, and inexpicably he encounters his new wife at several stops along the way, even though that would seem to be impossible since he's seemingly moving forward (albeit slowly) and she appears to intend to remain somewhat stationary. In a sense I think the limo ride is a microcosm for a Eric's journey through life.  There is that saying that some people are in your life for a reason and some people are in your life for a season and I think he encounters his wife several times as a symbol of all people in a person's life that they keep coming back to, but it's poignant because he never really understands her, or her him even though there is that desire. They both very much are pretending to be normal, or at least understand normal, and don't we all feel that way sometimes?  Even if he doesn't realize it the limo can be seen as his hearse because life is, afterall, a journey toward death.  It's important to note that Eric is going to all this trouble of traveling across town to see his father's barber, which I think is symbolic of Eric's desire to somehow either connect with his past, become like or understand his father, or reach some sort of arbitrary life goal he's set for himself based on familial expectations all while he's sprucing himself up for his inevitable demise.

One of the few misses in this movie is that Cronenberg left out a scene where Eric encounters ""three hundred naked people sprawled in the street"" and he takes off his clothes and joins them and even thinks he sees his wife, Elise, in the crowd.  In the book, I thought this was the only time that Eric really seemed to fit in with the people around him and it seemed to be the first time he understood Elise.  It seemed like a sort of ritualistic cleansing before burial for Eric.  Cronenberg also leaves out that in addition to Eric losing all his money he also intentionally loses all of Elise's as well.  I think this points to the ""you can't take it with you"" philosophy and helps Eric resign himself to the fact that he's done.  That Cronenberg didn't focus on these two bits of information makes me think that my entire interpretation of the story is wrong and you all should go about your day.  Nothing to see here folks.

In a much hyped about scene worth the price of admission, Eric Packer encounters Benno Levin, his ""stalker"" for lack of a better word, played by Paul Giamatti. The fact that Eric Packer's security team has been working locating an undetermined ""threat"" to Eric's safety which was presumably Levin, but that Eric inexplicably stumbles upon the warehouse where he is hiding with no real reason for going there in the first place calls for a similar suspension of disbelief to the one that allows you to believe that Eric can repeatedly and coincidentally encounter Elise when he is traveling and she, seemingly, is not.  It brought to mind that moment in Fight Club when you learn that Edward Norton IS Tyler Durden.  Imagining that that scene might be taking place inside Eric's head kinda blows my mind.  That being said, I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.

This movie is worth being seen because it is one of very few thinking movies. Much has been made about the fact that the timing of this movie coincides nicely with the Occupy Wallstreet movement but even though there are so many aspects of this movie that can make you think about the validity (or invalidity) of the financial market, this movie is really just about one person trying to find meaning in life.",1347926400,125,4469,4.569461827284105

5299498,2,B009AMABH6,"Cosmopolis is a rather dismal movie about a very small slice of what we are to believe is a window on a dystopian world. Robert Pattinson plays the main protagonist, Eric Packer, a late 20's disaffected billionaire who spends most of the movie in his stretch limo slowly riding across the city to a haircut. Along the way, various characters, in turn, join him in the limo as it dawdles along. Each has at least one major flaw to go with a twisted outlook on life, as do the people Packer encounters on his occasional laborious forays into the world outside his limo. Throughout, Packer trumps them all, maintaining his disconnected, often trance-like demeanor, whether in the throes of sex, having his limo pelted by demonstrators as he watches idly from his seat, desultorily discussing software with one of his minions, or engaging in potential and actual gunplay. Suicide never seems to be out of the question, or even far behind.

The movie deals heavily in allegory and is chock full of metaphors of the declining state of society as interpreted by screenplay-writer/director David Cronenberg from the Don DeLillo novel. Though there actually are a few points along the way that give the story some life - interesting visuals and important moments - they are dragged down by the somber overtones and sullenness of the portrayals. Of course, this is drama, but overall the film leans too severely on unrelieved angst.",1468454400,3,1422,4.9004149377593365

5299509,3,B009AMABH6,"I won't go straight into tell you that this movie is bad. But if you are not ""depressed"" or ""searching your purpose in life"", and you're looking for something to watch while you eat your favorite pop corn and pass time, don't watch this. Seriously; it will be a waste of time. I already had my phase many years ago in college when I had no girlfriend or money in my life and I watched every underrated movie just because I wanted to feel ""cool"". Now I'm more into blockbusters, Pixar and zombie stuff, but hey, my wife loves to cuddle up with me when I watch those, so, not a loss at all ;)

Back to the movie: I get it, David Cronenberg is a great director; I loved ""A history of violence"", ""eXistenZ"", ""Eastern Promises"", ""The Fly"" (I couldn't sleep for a week after that one); and a lot more. There's no doubt that this guy knows what he is doing. And I have no doubt that every second of this movie is made with his brains put at work. But it is simply not for everybody.

This is the kind of movie that your hipster arts-studying cousin will take to your house and say:

""&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;You have to watch this movie, it's awesome s*** and full of meaning, this may be the best movie ever, it's the best thing since Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'. Your life will change totally when you watch it!!!"".

Then you proceed to watch it... you don't really get anything together from the plot/plots/no-plot, you fight your primal instinct of getting the remote and change to something else, you are even afraid that your wife will think you're a weirdo; then the film ends, and since the only thing that changed inside you is your increased annoyance level, your cousin accuses you of being a pop-culture brainwashed idiot who just ""doesn't get"" what true cinema is. Don't believe me? Then you haven't met my cousin.

I have watched many no-pop movies that entertained me and even more, that moved my very core because of all the things that happen that make me think, reflect, cry, and let me devastated, but all with a motive. With this one, you are basically watching those Quentin Tarantino 's scenes which happen between the action shots, where the characters casually talk, eat, etc. but take away all the Tarantino's charisma, wit, fun, and entertaining, and what you are left with, is, well, this. You could even watch the entire movie in 4x or read the script and it's the same thing.

As for all the teen girls and gay guys whose eye candy of choice is Robert Pattinson, well, there you go, 109 minutes of him and only him, just sitting there, looking as always, talking weird as always, in a less blue color palette than in Twilight and with a little more saturation. Or you could just print a screenshot of him and place it in your wall; you'll get exactly the same effect.

BTW, for hetero guys and gay girls who want a ""similar"" movie with eye candy, I recommend ""Under the Skin"" with (naked) Scarlett Johansson. I didn't get a thing about it either (well, to be fair, that one was maybe a liiiiiitle more entertaining towards the end, but still, you have to endure the entire movie to get there), but hey, naked Scarlet Johansson, why complaint?

Bottom line: Are you an idiot for not ""getting"" this movie? No. Are you a weirdo because you (allegedly) got this movie? No. I'll put this 3 stars because I don't think of it as junk (after all, I respect the director). But for most people, it will be unwatchable.

It is impossible to get invested in it.

There is riots business talk through out the film. It seems that director David Cronenberg, doesn't really have a plot here, he seems to be playing with the green screen most of the time.

Yes, yay, art and the resistance of commodity and all that (there's surely a publishable article to come out of my reading here).

5299540,5,B009AMABH6,"David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis (2012) is a very fine adaptation of Don DeLillo's book of the same name which sees 28 year old multi billionaire 'Master of the Universe' investment genius Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) take a trip in his customer-designed stretch limo across New York to get a haircut. En route he meets all his important 'managers' who give him advice which he ruminates on. On the trip he encounters various obstacles - the President is in town which is causing chaos on the streets, there is an anti-capitalist 'rat' demonstration, a huge celebrity funeral cortege for a rap star, and finally the realization that someone out there is trying to kill him. Meanwhile Eric is waging a gigantic bet against the yuan (the yen in the book) in which he looks set to lose everything he has. In short Cronenberg follows DeLillo to a T here as he lays out a very contemporary vision of western society in which one of the most important leaders of it (who can make and break economies of countries depending on the investment decisions he makes) is basically a ruthless, cold, immature computer wizz who hasn't a clue how to conduct relationships in the real world. He disses his 'best friend' (technical advisor Jay Baruchel) at the film's outset for remaining mired in his pre-millionaire mindset which Eric once shared and has since moved on from, he has a weird 22 day-old marriage with socialite Sarah Gadon with whom he can't communicate normally, and he takes on advice from characters played by the likes of Juliette Binoche (a very sexy art dealer who protests on moral grounds when Eric says he wants to buy the Rothko Chapel), Samantha Morton (whose ultra cool techno-monetary spiel offsets the violence of the demonstration rocking the car from outside) and Emily Hampshire (who gives him hot financial advice while he receives an examination of his 'asymetrical' prostate and she crushes a plastic bottle between her legs). Completely self-obsessed, he is a symbol of everything that is bad about the capitalist system. The people that visit him in his car represent other aspects of the society, all of whom are dependent on him and who will go down when he also goes down. The film picks up tremendous claustrophobic power by being set almost entirely in the car and the performances are all uniformly excellent, especially Pattinson, Kevin Durand (his security advisor) and at the end, Paul Giamatti who plays his ultimate nemesis, Benno Levin.

The film is very faithful to the book, with virtually all the dialog taken straight from it. Cronenberg wrote the script himself in 6 days and said that all he did was take out the dialog and then create the linking passages. This is typically modest from the great man, because look carefully and there are subtle differences which do have huge effects. Most obviously missing from the film is the giveaway passage from Benno's confessions which broadcasts the story's conclusion very early. That gives the book a very different tone from the film. Then there is a vision towards the end of the book of a street covered in naked bodies for a film shoot, one of whom turns out to be his wife who he makes love to in a dirty alley. Possibly Cronenberg thought this might overtop the film's climactic confrontation between Eric and Benno. More practically perhaps he wanted to avoid local obscenity laws about public nudity in the US (and presumably Canada). The film has been criticised for having too much dialog. I disagree as it is in the sharp talk that DeLillo is at his best. Cronenberg knew this and therefore decided to make it an asset. If you don't like DeLillo you probably won't like this film. I have read all DeLillo's novels and I am thrilled that Cronenberg has given us here something so faithful to the original and, yet, so cinematic. As an adaptation it is every bit as successful as Cronenberg's other adaptations of 'difficult' reads, Naked Lunch (William Burroughs), Crash (J.G.Ballard) and Spider (Patrick McGrath).

The quality of this One Entertainment DVD is superb, Peter Suschitzky's digital photography looking christalline and very 'real' despite (because of?) the extensive use of green-screening throughout to re-create New York in Toronto. The DVD includes an excellent documentary 'Citizens of Cosmopolis' which has a longer running time than the film and goes way beyond the standard commercial 'making of' doc. We see all the cast in interview and best of all of course there's Cronenberg in action. Most striking is how much as an auteur film maker he still trusts all his actors and his crew to give him what he wants. The truth is he doesn't know what he himself wants at the beginning, but as the shoot develops and all the cast and crew give him very different takes on what he was expecting, we see the creative process in motion. The finished film is a product in which all involved feel they have given something personal, and yet it remains the work of one over-riding auteur. Great movie-making is essentially a collaborative enterprise and Cronenberg shows here how the process far from leading to compromise, in fact leads to something rich and fascinating. Great stuff.",1413244800,,5188,4.880952380952381

Rat-wielding commoners ranting about a spectre, in a city much impoverished while a luxe finance expert roams around in his limo, amidst an anarchic consciousness forced awake. The story itself owes more to Jack Womack's AMBIENT series than it may realize, but digressing~

There are few characters that are remotely likable, the dialogue brings a new kind of city parlance among its inhabitants, and is therefore confusing at times, but there is an honest lens filming the entire time.

He had done violence; he had done mistaken identity; he had done obsession (several times); he had done fetishes; and he had done dystopia. Now, he has done all of it in one movie, subtitled ""Canadian Nihilist"". He has focused all his mishegoss in one film and has done so with utter brilliance. Do not see this film, if you are happy, optimistic, acquisitive, like Wall Street, and hate the underdog. There are enough Disney films for that. This is a film for the underachiever; the loser; the crank and the critic; this is a film for the 99 % and not for the 1 %. Rats are a unit of currency, and apparently, to Cronenberg, so are humans, who are basically, rats. To call this film hyperdystopic is to say the Titanic had a small leak. This is 1/3 David Lynch (the editing and the aesthetics), 1/3 David Mamet (the rapid-fire esoteric dialogue) and 1/3 Cronenberg (the opening sequence, the
last third of the film, and the ending). Only cab drivers and barbers escape Cronenberg's withering sardonic humour and sarcasm, as he jabs billionaires (played, almost effortlessly, by Robert Pattinson), bitchy wives, narcissistic men and women, lesbians (but who end up being smarter than their bosses), doctors, bodyguards, anti-globalists, Mark Rothko (his paintings prominently displayed in the closing credits),
immigrants, guns, mental illness, sex, body odors, diners, agoraphobia, joggers, IT nerds, and even manages to insult rats, yes, rats. Lynch
has done this before (""Mulholland Drive"", ""Inland Empire"") and Robert Altman (""The Player""), but none of these were films about nihilism, about the eradication of reason and empathy, in the human soul. This film is a voyage through that eradication. If Cronenberg's brilliant ""Crash"" is one car crash (+ sex) after another, then ""Cosmopolis"" is one long crash (+ some sex). We just don't get to see the crash. This is a hilarious film without any laughter (and I did not laugh when I watched this film; quite the opposite). ""Gentlemen, what we have here, is a failure to communicate"". Yes, on practically every human level. The rats communicate more than the humans, who talk past each other,
as they nurse their own personal demons, totally oblivious to any other human (except the barber and the cabbie turned bodyguard). Cronenberg has produced a map of nihilism and what it can, and does, do to the human soul, deprived of love, empathy, community, health, almost everything, but especially what society does to those who make too much money, and those who used to make too much money,
and those, who make none at all. Why does an older generation Italian-American barber (former cabbie) bond with a middle-aged African immigrant (former cabbie), when all the middle-aged and younger White hedonists in Manhattan (Toronto as the actual site of filming) compete with each other to see, who is the most narcissistic ? We don't know, but Cronenberg seems to be saying something about race, age, profession and plunder, as different facets of human nature, but some are more humane than others. The nadir of Eric Packer's (Pattinson) journey, comes when he crosses self-pity with Richard Sheets aka Benno Levin, played with Academy Award-level quality, by Paul Giamatti. Levin (Sheets) used to work for Packer, but of course, Packer does not know him from Adam, as a CEO, he need not. Levin shoots at him, and Packer chases him down in his ""rathole"" apartment, a frightened, agoraphobic, mentally ill, man, who once stood for something important, but lost track of what it was. Packer reminds him of what it was, and Levin self-destructs, as he realizes that his life meant nothing, without his job, which he could not keep pace with. At the same time, Packer self-destructs in an orgy of narcissistic self-pity, only possibly exceeded by Levin's. Two men, one giant complex, and an asymmetric prostate. I will say no more, but the last 1/3 of the film is priceless. Both Pattinson and Giamatti are something to behold, as they try to outdo one another in self-victimhood and insanity. If you do not get this film, it is because, you are not SUPPOSED to get this film. You are supposed to feel this film and watch different facets of humanity claw their way, among the rats, for recognition and for empathy, totally incapable of generating any on their own. This is not, perhaps, Cronenberg's best film, or maybe it is (and, oh so many, to choose from). It is not didactic like ""Eastern Promises"", ""A History of Violence"" or ""A Dangerous Method"". It is the antithesis of ""eXistenZ"", the unwombing and unhybridizing of a man, who lives out of a white limousine (later, in the film, not so white), and doesn't even know how to bond with a rat. If you are a cynic, let alone, a nihilist, this film may or may not answer your questions or confirm your beliefs, but you will not forget this film for a long while, because Cronenberg does not want you to. And in that sense, Cronenberg himself, is as much the hedonist, as those he mocks, but he ISN'T out of a job.",1405209600,,5102,4.825342465753424

5299568,4,B009AMABH6,"It's been a while since I saw a new Cronenberg movie. Eastern Promises was my last one, back when it was in the theaters. I ordered Cosmopolis this week as I finally caved and got a Blu-Ray player. One of my first missions was to get all of my favorite director's work on disc.

The film takes place mostly in a limo. The limo in question changes on the inside, and a lot of what happens throughout the film is more metaphor than physical reality. The lead character is in a technological shell made of money and information and represented by the limo. Characters appear and vanish in scenes that suggest a 3-D visual text messaging. Outside the limo, chaos is running rampant in the streets, and different levels of social influence are impacting the information unfolding in the limo. Money, energy, social capital, and information are all crushed into one potent idea.

Visually, this one is solid Cronenberg. The sickly green waves of color in the scenes outside the car. The wife's drew matching the color of Paul Giamatti's towel, not to mention the formica on the diner tables. It's all tense, well thought out, and very demanding of one's attention. Worth more than one viewing to take all the ideas in and to clarify the metaphors at play.

The tone and dialogue reminds me of his 1996 ""Crash"" (not the later Matt Dillon anti racism medley.)  It all has something to do with capitalism and the insular world it's leaders get trapped in.  Sexual relationships seem to come and go without leaving a ripple.  There is an obsession with physical health while mental and emotional problems go unchecked.  Most of all, there is a complete lack of empathy and a focus only upon the self.  I may watch it again, because the abstract and zigzagging dialogue can be very difficult to pay attention to.",1392768000,,662,4.7631578947368425
5299607,5,B009AMABH6,"At the beginning of Cosmopolis, I wasn't sure what to make of the mannered speech and the way Robert Pattinson was making a young character act like a tough seasoned boss. At the same time, I was pulled in by his deliberate acting and sensed that a book by Don Delillo made into a film by David Cronenberg was going to be intelligent and interesting.

The movie takes place in a single day during a long drive from Wall Street(?) to a small barber shop where Eric, Pattinson's multimillionaire character, wants to get his hair cut. But it's not just a drive across town, it's journey during which Eric progressively rids himself of his fortune, his clothes, and his obsession with protecting himself against death. The setting is a surreal, bizarre Manhattan that's just close enough to reality to make you consider whether our world really is this absurd and unknown. As Eric finds his life falling apart during the drive, he seems to become more real and more compassionate, and when he murders one of his security people, it doesn't seem like a real act, but a metaphor for his decision to stop living with the money, status, and constant protection that enable him to avoid facing himself and avoid looking at the lives of people outside his world.

Someone, unknown to us until the end of the movie, wants to kill Eric, and his final destination turns out to be a meeting with this person(Paul Giamatti) - the barbershop is a stop on the way to find him, and also a turning point in the movie when Eric realizes the immigrant limo driver, previously too insignificant to be part of his story, is as important a character as everyone else.

From the beginning of the movie, Pattinson's character is trying to understand whether, existentially, his wealth and his status are worth anything. In one of the first scenes, he mentions a poem in which the world currency is dead rats, and as the movie continues, more and more dead rats appear, as if to confirm his suspicion that all the things he thought were important are as significant as a dead animal.  I think my favorite scene is the final meeting between Paul Giamatti and Robert Pattinson. Of course, Paul Giamatti's acting is great, and the two should probably act together again (or have they?) there was a good dynamic between them. I won't reveal whether Eric literally lives or dies, but what's important is that ultimately, Giamatti's character succeeds in destroying Eric's perception that his previous lifestyle had any value.

Afterwards I watched a few videos of David Cronenberg and Robert Pattinson talking about the movie. David Cronenberg said what inspired him to make the book into a movie was the mannered way Delillo wrote speech and dialogue; knowing that, I'd like to watch the movie again and read the book. Pattinson said the originality of the script pulled him in, and he did a great job of traversing the post-modern world and creating a character who transforms so subtly that you don't fully notice it until the end of the movie. I'll definitely be looking for him in more roles like this one.",1392336000,5,3079,4.726256983240224

Imagine my shock when the soulless and ultimately meaningless story unfolded before me. There was dialog but very little of it sunk in. The cast had things to say but so what? What was actually conveyed...? The point of the story seemed to be: ""The world's not really a very nice place"", but this was hardly the most surprising message of 2012. I struggled to connect with any of the characters and failed completely to have any sympathy or empathy for them. The only scene that woke me slightly from my post-Christmas excesses was when the protestor got a good kicking for (let's face it) being worthy of getting a good kicking.

5299763,4,B009AMABH6,"COSMOPOLIS has generated some extreme reaction since its release in mid- 2012. Some reviewers have loved it; others loathed it for its basic plotlessness, its static action and lengthy passages of dialogue. Basically a reflection on living in a capitalist society, the film centers on Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) living through a single day and moving from a position of security to one of relative instability. During that time he encounters a variety of characters, including some of his fellow-speculators, a barber who knew his father, and a deus ex machina figure forcing him to reflect on the consequences of living in a money-obsessed world. The film has a morality-play feel about it, with Packer as the representative of humankind enduring a series of encounters that expose some of the unwelcome aspects of life to him. Stylistically the film is quite repetitive; most of the action takes place in claustrophobic interiors, and the basic shot/reverse shot structure is employed during most of the conversational exchanges. This is deliberate on director David Cronenberg's part, as he tries to find an appropriate style to portray a world dedicated to repetitive ritual in which such things as emotion, spontaneity and chance had been squeezed out. COSMOPOLIS makes considerable demands on its viewers, but is definitely worth the effort.",1374537600,,1351,5.288372093023256

5299770,5,B009AMABH6,"A good David Cronenberg film is never something easy to watch, it's never something shallow or even likeable.  Cronenberg's filming style has always been about strangeness and perplexity, the portrayal of his characters' own strangeness and perplexity.  There's not much humor in them, they speak in epigrams, often dark ones, and come in and out of the film in a very enigmatic way.

However, the progression of the film is totally cerebral and quite complex.  It's claustrophobic too although this does not come from the closed spaces in which the story unwraps but from a deeper and more obscure anguish, one that can not be traced and is consequently expressed in a labyrinthine and disconcerting way, same as de Lillo's book and faithful to Cronenberg's own filming style.

Cosmopolis gives the Canadian director the chance to connect his more recent themes such as corporate politics, how the past shapes the present and the origin of violence with his older and more strange themes like the mechanization of the conscience, the correlation between technology and the body and the link between biology and power.  All of these topics and many more are present in the film, and these are exactly the themes that have placed David Cronenberg as one of the most original directors among contemporary filmmakers.

Pattison delivers a fine performance far removed from the ones he's done in more commercial and often stupid films.  Let's hope it does not take so long before he's able to shake off the s***ty Twilight stigma.

Cosmopolis is a towering achievement, another one in Cronenberg's gigantic and marvelous filmography, a real treasure... but only for those who think.",1372464000,2,1678,5.072727272727272

5299924,2,B009AMABH6,"""Cosmopolis"" is directed by someone who has made such films as ""Naked Lunch,"" ""Crash"" and ""Spider."" It is not very surprising that David Cronenberg turned a Don DeLillo novel into a film. Here, with a unique cast including Robert Pattinson, Juliette Binoche, Paul Giamatti and Samantha Morton, Cronenberg once again seems to have proved an age old theory: novel and film are two completely different media.

Meet a young billionaire Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) in a stretch limo, impervious to the chaos in the street. In ""Cosmopolis,"" however, the ""story"" means almost nothing. This is an allegory told in the coldest manner possible. What really matters is the dialogue, or the stream of dialogue, that is fast, dense and near impenetrable.

In book you can stop and re-read (or just read on and come back later). In film you just can't, which is frustrating and sleep-inducing. One character does a violent thing with a gun, and I believe it has some meaning (perhaps related to his reason for being) even though on screen graphic violence just overshadows it. After all ""Cosmopolis"" as a film is so self-absorbed, unwilling or unable to communicate with us, unless, of course, you are willing to repeat watching ... just like when reading.

In short, for all the strong performances from the players (especially from Pattinson and Giamatti) I don't see the point of making a film ""Cosmopolis"" in this way.",1368144000,,1412,4.97457627118644

5299962,1,B009AMABH6,"There are some very well-done films in the the existential/psychological drama genre. This is not one of them. After I watched this movie I found myself regretting the lost hour-plus of my life wasted when I could have been doing something more productive and I was relieved that I had only rented it from Redbox rather than having bought it.

The movie gets off to a promising enough start, but as soon as the main character (who is a mutant combination of Donald Trump and Justin Bieber and just about as lovable) gets into his limousine we're treated to an hour-and-a-half of stilted, idiotic dialogue the range of which is limited to inane quasi-philosophical commentary on technology/economics and the main character's libidinous urges. The few times he's not ensconced in his limo (yes, boys and girls, he even pees in his limo) he's out trying to bed down his stunningly beautiful but strangely asexual heiress bride, who is apparently the only woman he hasn't slept with recently. And it's understandable, really, because she's about the most pretentiously annoying girl one might hope to meet, focused as she is on her poetry, which evidently springs from her navel. The only other times he's out of the car are for a quick roll in the hay with a stun-gun wielding amazon (he usually copulates -- you guessed it -- in the limo) and a haircut, which has been the actual object of what I assume is supposed to be an earnest existential journey across NYC, frustrated as it is by rat-throwing anarchists and a funeral-of-state for a dead rapper. By the time we come to the final scene in the run-down apartment of neurotic, feces-begrimed gun-wielding Paul Giamatti, lone resident of a dusty postmodern computer graveyard (complete with ludicrous port-a-john that dumps excrement straight through a hole in the floor to the apartment below) we're begging for some sort of action, any sort, hopefully the death of the aggravating barely pubescent financier tyrant. But we get robbed. The film ends with no resolution save the suggestion that Giamatti is going to blow a man-sized hole in said barely pubescent financier tyrant with a comically oversized hand canon.... if he can ever stop sniveling about what a failure he is and how it's everyone else's fault.

The final nails in the coffin for this miserable excuse for a film are the little oversights in the dialogue that make one wonder why the script proofreaders didn't catch references to a windshield as a ""windscreen"" or to an elevator as a ""lift"". Certainly the chiefly European production crew would have had the good sense to consult with some Americans on the lingo, since the film is set in New York City? Apparently not....

**SIGH** Now you know the entire plot. Now you don't have to waste your time. I should have known better, really. I mean, how good is a movie going to be when it's been adapted from a DeLillo novel? DeLillo, king of posturing psychobabble.

5300009,5,B009AMABH6,"From the moment I heard that Robert Pattinson, he of the sparkly vampires of TWILIGHT, had been cast as the lead in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don Delillo's COSMOPOLIS, I knew immediately that this would be a polarizing film, and judging by the critical response and the response here, it certainly lived up to that expectation. What I didn't expect, though, is that R-Patz would be so compelling in this film, and that the film itself would be more of a return to Cronenberg's earlier career before he started making more ""Oscar-Caliber"" films like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, EASTERN PROMISES and A DANGEROUS METHOD. COSMOPOLIS is a film that reminded me of the hallucinatory semi-futurist setting of his classic VIDEODROME, in which the hybridization of humans and technology worked to create a revolution. Here, as we follow young multi-billionaire Eric Packer (Pattinson) in his ultra-high-tech limo through the streets of New York on his way across town to get a haircut, we see not a physical transformation, but rather a mental and almost spiritual transformation as his odyssey through the streets and the people lead toward a finale of inevitability.

Packer is betting his fortune against the Chinese form of currency falling, but it's not happening yet, and he is losing millions. He also is informed by his security detail that there is a potential threat on his life. But this is all just dressing for the meat of the film, which are the several liasons with different people he has throughout the day in his limo on his trek across town. He meets with his tech guru (Jay Baruschel), a seemingly teenaged currency genius (Philip Nozuka), a sexual liason with a beautiful woman (Juliette Binoche), a daily visit from a doctor which leads to a hilarious and uncomforable scene between himself and another underling (Emily Hampshire), a discussion with a technological futurist (Samantha Morton), and more as he continually meets with his new and very wealthy bride (Sarah Gadon) to share a meal with her. All of this continues pressing on throughout a sometimes clean and shiny streetscape and a sometimes frightening hellscape as anti-capitalist protesters run amok in the streets, and it's likely that one of them could be the threat against Packer's life. More sex and shocking violence occurs as the night comes to a close, and Packer finds himself face to face with his real assassin, played by Paul Giamatti.

What's so striking about this film is also the reason that people looking for an old-fashioned entertaining night of watching a film will be disappointed, and that is the monologues and one-on-one dialogue exchanges throughout the film, primarily taking place in Packer's limo. The film has a great deal to say about society, technology, nature, and humanity, but none of it is set or said in a particularly realistic fashion. The hyper-stylized dialogue is like honey in your ears as it constantly flows, and the performances are compelling, dark and stripped-down in a way that only an independent film can do AND make work. Pattinson is quite good as Packer, a young man who seems like he's already lived most of his life and accomplished most of his goals. Part of what is so fascinating about Packer is how lifeless he seems, even when he's living on the edge of reason. He takes what he wants when he wants it without any thought or care about the consequences. Even his own psyche is as sterile and as ordered as the interior of his limo, until he leaves it, which is when he begins to crack. Most of the other actors who populate the film are passers-by, who are not whole characters but rather reflections or representations of parts of his mind, but that doesn't diminish their presence. Standing out here, though, is Giamatti as the crazed funhouse mirror of Packer, who has focused every element of his life into killing Packer. His performance here is almost self-parody of a sort. Giamatti takes his typical sad-sack self and amplifies it to manic levels.

It's likely that many of the people renting this film without knowing what it's about and solely for the purpose of watching Robert Pattinson in something have been and are going to be sorely disappointed with, since they won't know what they're getting themselves into, but fans of David Cronenberg and his films and Cronenberg's mission statement that has permeated almost all of his films will not find themselves disappointed with COSMOPOLIS. It's dark, disturbing, unsettling and tragic, which is pretty much the signature of Cronenberg's best work.",1362355200,2,4554,4.958115183246074

5300071,2,B009AMABH6,"Let me state upfront that I am generally a big fan of Canadian director David Cronenberg, even though his movies are hits and misses, but even in the misses, Cronenberg seems to bring a unique persepctive.

""Cosmopolis"" (2012 release; 109 min.) brings the story of Eric Packer (played by Robert Pattison), a 28 yr. old financial Wall Street whiz kid who uses his stretch limousine pretty much as his office, and we see the limo driving in New York towards his barber as Packer needs to get a haircut. Several events intervene, and that is when things starts to unravel, seemingly without sense or purpose.

Several comments: to tell you that I am bewildred, and disappointed, by this movie, would be an understatement. Characters come and go, and it's hard to understand why. Juliette Binoche, who gets 2nd star lining in the movie just below Pattison, appears out of nowhere having sex with Packer in the limo and is in the movie for all of about 10 min. or so. Then there are the improbable, at times laughable lines. Such as Packer saying ""My prostate is asymmetrical"" to a woman, who responds ""What does that mean?"" and Packer responding ""I don't know"". And then later on Benni (played by Paul Giamatti) exclaiming ""I have my syndromes, you have your complexes. You did it to yourself!"", and on and on. On a minor plus side, the movie does feature a couple of songs from fellow Canadian indie-band Metric. If you wonder why I watched the movie to the end, all I can offer is that I was hoping it would get better and I was on a 15 hr. trans-pacific flight and simply killing time.

However, I found his character so repulsively insipid that I couldn't even enjoy watching the actor.  This seemed like a series of one-shots that continued without purpose, and the plot only served to show the lead character's inability to understand let alone engage with the outside world because he was unable to control it and/or find it stimulating for his overdeveloped ego.  The film's conclusion was neither satisfying nor motivational and brought no sense of significance to the pointless plot.

And then he started to choose projects that would stretch him and confound his fans. Bel Ami was stiff, but Cosmopolis is a study in stiff. It's not a movie so much as a long nightmare in which every word is measured and every character represents something heavy. Seriously, movie lovers, why deliberately expose yourselves to this free-flowing abuse of screen time? Even Pattinson, who is very handsome in his business suit, isn't enough to make me want to watch this again. I'm not sorry I bought it; I'm just sorry I watched it.",1360800000,9,706,4.656
5300110,2,B009AMABH6,"I'm a big fan of Mr. Cronenberg. I've seen quite a few of his films and ever since watching it, Spider was my absolute least favorite of his. In fact, I hated that film. Well, Cosmpolis has now easily taken its place. This movie is so pretentious, bloated and dismally boring, that I'm not exactly sure what attracted such big stars as Juliette Binoche and Paul Giammati to join in. I'm excluding Rob Pattinson because I'm sure he was quite honored(and thankful) to be starring in such a different film coming off his Twilight streak.  Anyway, the plot revolves around a billionaire (Pattinson) who wants to get a haircut, way across town (Manhattan). His personal bodyguard/security is against this idea and numerous times throughout the film tries to veer him away from his haircut idea. Almost the entire movie takes place in his white stretch limo. Inside, he meets throughout the day with various people, some for business, some for pleasure. Oh yes, he even gets a prostrate exam(which he apparently does every day) in the limo by a doctor. At breakfast time and lunch he meets up with his wife, who is even more emotionally barren than he is. There is zero indication of what attracted these two to begin with. Aside from wealth (and their dead eyes), they seem to have nothing in common. Clearly, his character is a sociopath, a cheater and emotionally whacked. But none of these facts make the film any more interesting. In fact, I can't even count the times I nearly fell asleep. Too much talk, most of it seemingly random and not making much sense. The tone is deliberatly monotone, which doesn't help one's acting abilities. It all just seems so scripted and strange. It's such a departure from Cronenberg that one would never even recognize his work here. I can't recommend this.",1360800000,,1792,4.762057877813505

5300135,2,B009AMABH6,"Robert Pattison plays a role of 28 year old billionaire who has made his fortune playing the stock and currency market.  Almost the entire movie is filmed inside of his long, stretched limo where he seems to spend most of his time: meeting his business partners, hookers, friends, random people.  They talk about anarchy, money, information, art, music.  It is almost as if this young man with so much money has nothing better to do but prove that anything and everything can be bought.  As he plays the (stock) market, he suddenly decides to go across town and have a haircut in the old heighborhood where he grew up.  The old barber happens to be his father's friend and that is how we learn that this billionaire's father died when he was only five years old.  One cannot but wonder if his mathematical and methodical mind in an attempt to make sense of his fatherless childhood, prove that one can be successful (financially) even without male role model in his life.

However it seems that this young man has something that he cannot buy.  His wife comes from old money and as crude and raw as he is, she is refined and cultured.  They are at odds because they seem to live on the opposite ends of the world.  He drives in a stretched limo, she takes a NYC cab around the city; his entertainment are random people that enter his limo while her world is solitude in the local bookstore; he is busy making love to women who are of questionable character while his wife goes to the theatre, elegant and quiet and the only hint of her distress is her attempt to smoke a cigarette which she does not even seem to enjoy.  His life is life of excess, her life is more measured, calm and orderly.  Their devide becomes apparent when he admits to her he is about to loose all of his money to the bet he made on the stock market against chinese yuen currency.  She  quietly offers him money so he can start fresh - in exchange for freedom (read divorce) he seems to crave.  It is only the expression on his face that makes viewer realize that this man would do anything to keep his wife, but the nature of their relationship give a whole new meaning to the term ""irreconcilable differences"".  For her, it is easy to explain her stand.  She says to him: ""I am not indifferent.  That makes me susceptable to pain.""

As film progresses it almost seems that main character's internal turmoil is expressing itself with riots happening outside of his limo.  No one can make sense of it and other than anger and despair and resentment towards polarity that surrounds all protagonist - nothing particularly original.  It almost took me an hour before the film grabbed my full attention.  One action that the main character does changes the entire course of story and of course his destiny.  Seemingly with nothing left to loose: his marriage is over, his money is lost, he committs an act that is a statement that he gives up on his life; he finally decides to confront his stalker (played by Paul Giamatti) and that encounter I found somewhat disappointing.  However, the end will let you hanging and you can make you own choices on how all of these characters end up.  Subtle references to Erik Satie, Mike Rothko, anarchy and monks who set themselves to fire in order to make a (political or ideological) statement all leads us to one conclusion.  Here is a 28 year old man who has it all with nothing else left to prove.  For a man like that is there anything left in life he has not done, felt or experienced yet?  You be the judge.",1360627200,2,3524,4.481191222570533

I can deal with abstract views ,or so I previously thought, I enjoy sci fi movies, usually if you cant really ""get"" the abstract ideas,the film will be visually appealing at least. This movie is a disturbing waste of time because it is hard to understand what the characters are talking about, or care what the point is, and the ending is the biggest waste of all. I honestly don't even understand why any mainstream players would want to be involved in this, if there actually was a statement involved, it certainly didn't hit home with me : (",1360454400,3,823,4.282051282051282

5300206,5,B009AMABH6,"This movie is certainly not the average and you could watch it multiple times and just realize something you missed the last time you viewed. Say what you will about this movie but no one can deny that Pattinson performed his arse off in this movie. Colin was first cast and couldn't fulfill the obligation to Cronenberg but I say this with extreme confidence. Colin Farrell couldn't have touch Pattinson's performance in this movie. Watch it...not everyone will like it but it is a piece of art with a contemporary message. I hated DeLillo's book finding it unoriginal when you look back at the movie Game 6 with Keaton it has some of the same lines and patterned similar in plot. But I give credit to Cronenberg he pulled off a difficult script and unique in its air. This Eric Packer's world as it is  was defined by the people and professionals around him in his daily life, which begins to crumble and he just seeks and hungers for definitions. Especially since what he thought (his life)  was defined in truth but easily eludes him, he struggles inwardly and outwardly to make sense of his current experience. People, Pattinson playing off Giamatti, a supreme actor, was an exceptional scene. Giamatti was excellent and Pattinson was such a compliment. Binoche was wonderful, however, I didn't like how Cronenberg introduced her into the movie, you cut immediately to she and Pattinson having sex and it seemed to lack flow moving into her intro into the limo and then again maybe that was the only way to do it without subtle entrances. Kevin Durand did an exceptional job and so pulled off his character's interaction with Pattinson, as well as, Gadon. She was a great cast giving such a unique air to her Elise character. This movie will not entertain the shallow thinker. It is definitely is for the viewer who wants his intellect stimulated and entertained at the same time. There is some  sarcastic comical dialogue between Pattinson and Gadon....the peanuts, her mom's tits..who in the hell have seen their mother in laws tits and has complimentary thoughts? Get the movie and pay attention. You will marvel at Pattinson and Giamatti..they should hook up again. Pattinson shows the acting chops of an experience actor and not an actor made by a pop culture. I really believe if he plays his cards right and keep taking roles with a lot reach, he'll be one of the greats. Mission Blacklist is an excellent choice for Pattinson so that he can capture a male audience as well. Well done the entire cast of Cosmopolis!! Well done photography, directorship and producing hands, be proud Cosmopolis was an excellent movie make and deserves more applause than it received, only simply because it stands solo from the average movie that tickles your senses with CGI heroics. Instead the movie offering its viewers something to really consider, that being,  are we as a people living life in our world existing in truth or only in the fallacy of truth which mankind thinks he has created. A fallacy created simply because that is the way it is and has always been simply because of life outcomes that surround us from our experiences and what we impute on the world because those experiences,  which left its mark on the world.

5300353,1,B009AMABH6,"I watch and admire movies made by Almodovar, David Lynch, Aronofsky, Solondz, Charlie Kaufman and alot of Soderbergh stuff, so Im not opposed to the symbolic or far-out. When the character is monotone and cryptic, he doesnt have to be boring, but he is here because he's MEANINGLESS. He's meaningless when nothing he says connects to our deeper understanding of his humanity - perhaps being reflected from some dark caverns of emotional connectivity. There are utterances that have no connective tissue within consensually validated meanings. In short, we have words that make no sense, or which make  non-sense.

Many lines are spoken without the viewer believing the actor has any concept of who this character is; who he was or why he was saying these things. He repeats lines from memory. Its like ""we've smoked a joint; now anything we utter is cool. I am David Cronenberg, and everything I poop is gold; the chemical aids I ingest help me know it's so.""

FINALLY, Paul Giamatti arrives with a brilliant performance at the end.  The writer's  'almost-there' understanding of the schizoid life of intellectual ""knowing"" versus ""really feeling"" as-the-same-thing is great stuff concerning the workings of the ""Mirage""; and it is rare to shine light into this dark world.

Giamatti takes this bunch to school; - the ENTIRE FILM becomes dramatic, taut, fascinating.... altho the acting of both the wife (Sarah Gadon) and the bodyguard (Kevin Durand) was also very good. The movie could have gotten real legs had they accelerated the wife into being Patinsons gadfly, a more than able intellect, not-intimidated by his wealth and power; but that task was probably as intimidating to Cronenberg as it was to his creation of character-Patinson. This appears a drug-induced script, that no-doubt looked great in the wee hours of morning's spinning mentalities, but now lives as just another delusion; boring and unimpressive in the light of day.",1359676800,6,1942,5.110410094637224

This is a very sick movie.  Exactly how sick, I cannot say, since I dumped the movie after 35 minutes.  But based on what I did see, and based upon the drift of the movie, I would say this movie would have probably hit a 10 on my Sick Score.

As far as stupid is concerned, ""Cosmopolis"" is right up there on the Stupid Score, also.  The awful 35 minutes I suffered through was filled with unnatural, disconnected, and ridiculously stilted dialog.

I hope the $3.99 I wasted on this movie will save you and many others from making the same mistake.

5300359,1,B009AMABH6,I love David Cronenberg movies but this was a failure. Its a guy in a limo on his way to get a haircut and just has crappy conversations with with people on the way. I couldn't even make it past 30 minutes i'm really glad I only rented it.,1359244800,5,239,3.8979591836734695
5300360,5,B009AMABH6,"I purchased both the book and the movie due to my interest in Mr. Pattinson's involvement. I had never been a huge Cronenberg fan, but I have to say that his spot-on screenplay, coupled with Mr. Pattinson's portrayal of Eric Packer was magnificent. The story is very eclectic and requires significant attention to the story's dialogue, but it packs a serious punch! It's ironic that Mr. DeLillio wrote his book 10 years ago, because his depiction of capitalism (and mind you, I am a strong believer in capitalism) is eerily similar to what we are seeing on Wall Street today -- young millionaires and billionaires who have no concept (or cares) as to how their unmitigated greed affects others. In my humble opinion, the conversation between Packer and his ""minister of philosophy"" is the key to the whole story. If nothing else, this story will enable  much conversation and debate amongst friends. I see a great on-screen future for Mr. Pattinson, and I eagerly await more from Mr. Cronenberg.",1359244800,4,995,4.887573964497041
5300421,4,B009AMABH6,"Based on Don DeLillo's novel of the same name, the movie centers on a 28-year-old super billionaire named Eric who wants a haircut. He is warned that many complications lay in wait but he insists on going ahead. Along this staggeringly original odyssey, Eric hops in his seemingly indestructible Andover the top futuristic limo and begins the day long ride. Along the way he meets some extremely unique characters including his economically obliged but very distant wife Elise, his mistress, a doctor who gives him a prostate exam in the limo and his financial adviser as well as a group of insane anarchists and his own destined assassin, a psychotic man played expertly by Paul Giamatti.

This epic journey for an every day task becomes extremely complicated and at some points is very hard to follow. The plot is completely dialogue based and the dialogue is poetically complex and takes a little bit of thought to figure out just what they're talking about, defiantly a movie that you should watch with a dictionary or thesaurus nearby.

It really is an extremely original and very entertaining movie with several original characters. I enjoyed it but once it was done I didn't feel compelled to buy it. It lacked a certain gripping power but it was fun to watch through once and maybe I'll get it form the library again in the future.",1359244800,3,1339,4.792207792207792
5300422,3,B009AMABH6,"In trying to figure out why this film By David Cronenberg fails to work it is probably best to return to the original novel of the same name by Don DeLillo. The story's  themes - `power, technology, violence, terrorism, crowds, the movements and counter-movements of contemporary culture - are those of White Noise, Libra and Mao II. The setting, a contemporary yet futuristic New York, is familiar terrain. Stylistically, too, it's business as usual. The protagonist Eric Packer isn't someone we're meant to engage with. A running motif is his contempt for last week's big thing, especially technology. Skyscrapers, airports, phones, walkie-talkies, personal computers, vestibules, automated teller machines, assassination attempts on presidents: he finds them all comically outdated. His own gadgetry, with its flashing monitors and flowing numbers, works in another time-frame, bringing events before they happen and giving them a sharpness they lack in ""real life"". Doubt and ambiguity aren't concepts he understands. He sees himself as the future - and thinks that when he dies the world will end, not him. Packer is less a character than a cypher, a symbol of dystopian triumphalism. If he doesn't seem ""believable"" or ""realistic"", so be it: the words have no meaning in the world he inhabits.'

So given the cerebral dysfunction of the novel, it is a bit easier to cope with the ennui of this film. Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut, Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson, in a monotone, phoned in `performance'), a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager's day devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. The characters are basically tropes that are attempted to be inhabited by such fine actors as Samantha Morton, Juliette Binouche, Sarah Gadon, Paul Giamatti, Juliette Binoche, Kevin Durand, Mathieu Amalric, Jay Baruchel, etc. The film begs indulgence on the audience's part and it takes a certain mindset to make it through to the end. It has the makings of an interesting movie, but gets off track very early on. Grady Harp, January 13",1359158400,2,2116,5.130434782608695

the the story line loses itself in realities.

5300442,1,B009AMABH6,"This is more like a heavily stylized stage play than a conventional film. The performances are all ratherly deliberatly deadpan, the dialogue is all very unnatural and the plot is one long series of small encounters after another. Cut down appropriately, it might actually be better as a play than a film.

There is endless repetitive empty dialogue babbling about techology and money all with the spectre of ""the revolution"" lurking in the background. It gives the impression of being deep, but its all profoundly shallow. No particular insights are offered other than sort of a mindless heavy-handed tantrum against all modern life. When it runs out of empty words, the film is carried to a conclusion through violence. It doesn't even really end. It just ceases.

Paul Giamatti gives by far the best performance in the film in whats probably the key role. It almost reminds me of ""heart of darkness"" in terms of plot played out in New York. Heart of Darkness usually fails as Drama because nobody can live up to being ""Kurtz"" toward the end. The film gets that part kind of right, but everything else wrong.

The film is all style but no substance. All the characters are one-dimensional sockpuppets. It was interesting to watch because it was so unconventional, but its not a good film in any sense.

One final note. The extras for this film are extremely interesting. There is a very long ""making of"" documentary that in some ways is better than the film itself. If its watched carefully, you can sort of figure out why the film turned out the way it did.

The best bit of irony is listening to the director talk about the ""dehumanizing"" nature of technology as a theme in the film in terms of wall street. But he doesn't see how he himself has dehumanized the whole film process from treating his actors like machines to shooting his film almost entirely in a green screened digital world .... to trying to direct laying on a couch in his trailer. The process of making Cosmopolis documented here is as strange and dehumanizing as anything to be found on Wall Street or in the world of technology.",1358899200,13,2103,4.688346883468835

5300597,3,B009AMABH6,"A film that leaves you feeling, ""WTF?"" This avant-garde work oozes with symbolism and metaphors. The first one you should pick up on is the rat. The rat symbolizes a universal currency when society is at its lowest point. Toward the end of the film, Eric's barber comments ""You're hair is ratty."" Investor Eric Packer (Robert Patterson) represents all rich people whose world must be destroyed to make way for the new. This is your basic Phoenix or Shiva philosophy. Eric is being driven through NYC as all kind of events are happening outside of his limo. Eric is shielded from these events as his financial world goes to ruin. The world outside passes by almost in a surreal fashion and at times he blocks it out altogether.

We have the destruction idea as Eric has bet against the Yuan, Chinese currency. The theory implies that China is the new empire built upon the ashes of our American empire. Don't bet against it.

The people who enter Eric's cab appeal to be bits and pieces of his psyche. This is brought out when one woman who prattles on about philosophy (some key metaphor points) and claims she is his ""Chief of Theory."" Sarah Gadon plays Eric's trophy wife, a woman he knows nothing about and hasn't slept with. Their whole relationship was odd and clearly symbolic of...God knows what. Eric builds his world on formula and balance when life has neither.

For people who like their films straight forward, forget it. Good luck with this one.

I am an avid David Lynch and Charlie Kaufman fan so these types of films tend to appeal to me. However Cosmopolis was a lifeless film, it was an audiobook with pictures. I was 30 minutes into the film asking myself when will the film actually begin. The acting is monotone and when I mean monotone I mean the actors including the main character all speak like the agents in the matrix, there is no chemistry or engagements between the characters, almost like they could all be CGI talking to blue screens, most of the time they are not even looking at one another while speaking. I understand capitalism is a machine and that could be a minor explanation for the dialogue but it just does not engage the viewer one bit. It kind of reminds me of the film Waking Life but lacking in any substantial existential realizations. Paul Giamatti's 15 minute performance at the end was suberb and probably left a lasting impression on some to give it a favorable review. However this performance does not amend the fact that you just spent an hour and a half listening to dialogue as monotone as a GPS indicator and watching actors just reading lines out loud as if they were reading the script for the first time. The artistic qualities of this film have eluded me, if one finds mathematics to be an art then this film may appeal to you otherwise this film is 2 hours of wasted existence.

You'll probably need to watch it twice, or view the insightful director's commentary, or read the original DeLillo novel to understand some of it, and you will still be thinking about it months afterwards.

I like one reviewer's idea of playing the DVD in the background, letting the philosophical ideas seep into your brain.  Some may argue it should have been a stage play: at least then the audience would be prepared for the challenging dialogue and claustrophobic atmosphere.  But I hope this finds a wider audience this way, at the risk of nonsensical ""boring"" reviews by unsuspecting and unprepared viewers.

There are many uncomfortable moments and truths about today's society explored and where we may be headed as a species.

5300657,1,B009AMABH6,"What can I say? The Idea of the film was interesting BUT...(and I feel so disloyal for saying this) I have long suspected that Robert Pattinson was not very intelligent, he giggles during interviews and looks down at his shoes-alot. The woman he chooses to be with is shallow and inarticulate-just when people are starting to like her again, she opens her mouth and says something stupid and arrogant, when she is not dropping the F-Bomb three times in each sentence. My point is- an intelligent man would need to be with someone who had some depth to them. He is beautiful to look at and was born to play Edward Cullen (as Christopher Reeves was born to play Superman) sometimes an actor and a role just ""click"" But I'm afraid he just didn't have the intellectual depth to make this role work, he was outclassed (and out -acted ) by every single person who got into that car! Most (not all) of the people in the film were robotic and talked in a monotone  ,I understand this was done for effect -but in R-Patz case, he did it because there wasn't a single thought rolling around in that gorgeous head of his  and you could see it in his eyes. An actor was needed who could act cold and  removed -  emotionally and morally bankrupt, yet convey that there were oceans of seething emotions going on underneath all that cold detachment. Robert ( I'm saddened to say) was badly out of his depth. The stilted dialog just didn't work and was laughably bad at times. An Actor who could have conveyed ""layers""of emotion might have made this film interesting, as it was-it was a cinematic dry-hump; painfully frustating with no release.

But for me, it's probably one of the most unusual and most fascinating movies I've seen all year.  At its surface, it's a beyond-simple story.  Billionaire Eric Packer wants to get a haircut across town and gets in his limo to get there.  But the simple story unravels into a more complex look at a man detached from humanity, and the main character unravels as the journey goes forward.  Robert Pattinson has certainly done nothing like this in the past.  He is almost robotic in the beginning... starched and monotone.  But as the suit comes off, and his day gets more complicated slowly we see what is underneath the exterior, and what is underneath is interesting and complex and, ultimately, sad.  It's an amazingly nuanced, mature portrayal which managed to make me feel and ache for a character that could have come across as completely unlikeable.  An excellent acting job all around, as is the acting from the very talented supporting cast, especially Samantha Morton and Paul Giamatti.

The movie is told completely in DeLillo's interesting, rhythmic dialogue.  It dances and weaves and speaks of markets and sex and talking fungus between a man's toes.  It is also very darkly humorous and relevant to today's society.  It did take some getting used to, but the more I heard it, the more I let it wash over me, the more I enjoyed it.

This is not a movie for everyone, that is for sure.  But for people with an open mind and a desire to see something with a non-traditional narrative and style, it will not fail to challenge and entertain.",1357516800,10,1665,4.729166666666667

My husband didn't love it as much however, but said he'd give it a 3.  Though he hadn't read the book and knew nothing about it at all, he didn't mind the movie and even said he can relate to certain aspects of it, just that he thought there were some flaws in the story (to which I agree to some extent) that made it not great in his opinion.

It is a well chosen cast of actors that draw me into their character's own diatribe of thought in regards to their world and mine.  I like the strange atmosphere of a futuristic New York City with violent hostile mobs without-a-cause and Eric's bizarre, persistent quest across the violent, dangerous and congested city to get a haircut,unto an equally bizarre end.

We see sex with no real context, death with no reason or social commentary, and cliche contrasts between a filthy-rich young tycoon and various sycophants and have-nots.  These do not make a movie worth the time wasted to watch it.

Robert Pattinson plays a an uber-rich financial tycoon out looking for a bit of a haircut across town (literally).  But his screen presence is stiff and simplistic - his dialogue carries none of the insights that would necessarily flow from someone sophisticated enough to have reached his supposed position.  Similarly the people around him bring little to the table.  The only message one could even remotely glean from this would be that youngsters who obtain power quickly bring little depth, intelligence, or sophistication with them to their positions.

For me, DeLillo became my favorite modern American novelist about three books into his chronology of works. Cronenberg matured into a heavyweight film director about halfway through his career. A match-up of these two gifted artists seemed inevitable to me. The novel ""Cosmopolis"" by DeLillo felt like the perfect project for Cronenberg to explore with his off-center sensibilities. I was not disappointed. The film is absolutely mesmerizing. I will express no more about it other than to note its only fault, which is the absence in the film of DeLillo's outdoor macram of naked bodies in midtown Manhattan.

Just take a look at some of the other reviews, such as 'worst movie ever' . This is the second move with a great actor, Paul Giamatti, playing a pivotal role ( Barney's Version ) wherein we are ""entertained"" by not a single human soul in the story with a working moral compass. We ruthlessly exploit the world for staggering wealth and power?, with each character displaying in fine form their ""Self Totality, utterly without remorse of any kind"". We drink, we fornicate with whomever, and whatever female is in the scene,; we ruthlessly knock about, beat, kill, and destroy people & property on all sides, in an ever darkening
slide of humanity into nihilist ooze. ( nihilist: "" a viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded and that existence is senseless and uselss; Oooze: ""to emit slowly, that which is often seen as faintly repellant"" In a word, the director left out a good long straining bowel movement ~ although he did favor us with a prolonged prostate examination.)

Most of the movie takes place in a rich kid's limo. A lot of pontificating - mostly about wealth - so we're subject to a whole lotta philosophizing. I guess Cronenberg never heard of Goldwyn's statement that if he wanted to send a message he'd use Western Union.

This movie moves along at the glacial pacing of a snail on Quaaludes. Lots of scenes of people talking AT each other... endlessly, boringly (did I mention that?), and repeatedly. It reminds me of the ""experimental theater"" exercises we used to practice when I was studying drama in college. If you like college-level theatrics, you might enjoy this flick.

5300951,4,B009AMABH6,"I love Cronenberg's style.
Growing up I loved Carpenter, Walter and Deborah Hill, Depalma, and Cronenberg's work.
I just loved their style.
It's kind of funny to me sometimes because Cronenberg seems to have a little bit of all those directors styles and then his own rolled into one.
 Maybe I'm off the mark saying that but I mean it as a compliment.
There also seems to be a dash of David Lynch incorporated here (for better or worse).
Anyway, ""Cosmopolis' is one of Cronenberg's best works for sure.
I liked it better than 'Videodrome', 'A history of Violence', 'Eastern Promises', and 'Crash' to name a few.
It's hard to top 'Scanners' or 'The Dead Zone' as far as David's work goes but 'Cosmopolis' is up there.
I think the dialogue and exchanges between characters were too tongue in cheek for a lot of folks to digest.
I think more pretentious viewers may of been trying to extract deeper meanings from the stream of hollow banter that's on going throughout the film, but I think it just is what it is.
Overall the movie seemed to me to be about a cold, calloused, selfish, over-privileged, out-of-touch rich person's descent into self destruction set against the background of class warfare.
Sometimes the main character may appear to be looking for deeper meanings about life, but he is who he is.
Really, the film was like if a sociopath let me tag along to witness their potential demise for 24 hours and along the way we encounter a lot of strange people and situations.
Sometimes the movie can leap from comical to vicious in the blink of an eye.
If you're looking for a point to the film you may or may not be disappointed.
This film is more of a ride to me than a story. But I do like the story.
Robert Patterson did a great job I thought. He's perfect for the role because he's an odd fit.
Some people found the ending to get dragged out and a little boring, to be honest it did feel that way to me a little but not enough to hurt the film.
Once again, I really love Cronenberg's direction and it shines here.
It's a bizarre flick.
If you're looking for a stylish movie that sets the controls for the heart of the sun, from a great film maker, then you might be in love.

5300953,4,B009AMABH6,"To say that COSMOPOLIS isn't for everyone doesn't quite capture it.  This is a film whose plot, such as it is, basically hinges around the value of Chinese currency.  Its central character, young businessman Eric Packer, spends most of the movie in his limo, on his quest across New York City in order to get a haircut that he doesn't really need.

In other words: Robert Pattinson's legions of TWILIGHT fans should steer clear.  Not that they will.

As far as Pattinson goes, he's aptly cast.  He's able to radiate an emotional detachment, even when he's conveying a sense of ironic enjoyment at the downturn events are taking.  (The best comparison I can think of is Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX: an actor who, talent or lack thereof aside, was perfect for the part; that being said, Pattinson actually does have some acting talent up his sleeve, and shows it here.)  The supporting cast--featuring Jay Baruchel, Sarah Gadon, Samantha Morton, Juliette Binoche, Mathieu Amalric, Paul Giamatti, and others--rotates in and out, each shining in their own, Cronenberg-influenced way.

This is definitely David Cronenberg's film; in fact, it's the first film in years that feels reminiscent of the Cronenberg of the 70s and 80s.  He takes Dom DeLillo's basically unfilmable little novel and translates it beautifully to the screen.  The film founders a bit in spots (it's a tad too long for such an intimate, moral story), and comes off as too didactic in other spots.  Of course, that's the point; there's rarely anything subtle about a Cronenberg film, and COSMOPOLIS is a shining example.  It's certainly not for everyone; but for those who dare to enter Cronenberg's devious imagination, there's a real treat to be found here.",1356998400,3,1724,4.965156794425087
5300954,4,B009AMABH6,"Billionaire corporate asset manager Eric Packer coolly surveys the death of capitalism as he rides through Manhattan in a stretch limo looking for a good place to get a superfluous haircut.

Not having read the book or really knowing what to expect, I watched COSMOPOLIS for the first time last night. There's still a lot I don't get, which is all right because that's the sort of film it is: You don't have to savor every detail, bit of conflict, or other nuance in order to feel like you've been taken somewhere quite unusual, and new things will pop up with each view.

The quality of the filming, acting, and everything else ranges from good to impeccable. There are many interesting characters and changes in scenery, and plenty of unexpected and often very amusing stuff happens. Nevertheless, COSMOPOLIS is driven more by ideas (conveyed mostly through dialogue)than plot or character. There are all kinds of multiple themes here: desire/greed, love/sex, creation/destruction, and it often raises the question of whether certain dual concepts that we tend to consider antonymous are actually synonymous extensions of one another. COSMOPOLIS is full of symbols: Without reaching too far, one can interpret the various details in a variety of different ways.

A lot's been said about what a strange movie this is, and, well, if you like ""strange,"" you'll probably like COSMOPOLIS. The whole flavor of the film could be described as surreal or, perhaps, realistically cartoonish. For some reason, it reminded me a bit of the film adaptations of Vonnegut's novels (SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, HARRISON BERGERON, et al), not to mention BATMAN.

I enjoy intellectual and artistically abstract movies, but Cosmopolis is shallow intellectualism hiding behind obtuse, silly dialogue and poor acting. Robert Pattinson does his career no favors by maintaining the dead-behind-the-eyes ""acting"" technique he mastered for the Twilight series. The only good thing about the film is Paul Giamatti, but only because he is eminently watchable. Unfortunately, Giamatti doesn't show up until late in the film, so you sit through a lot of suffering to get to him.

**Best scene**
Robert Pattinson undergoes the longest prostate exam in the history of mankind while discussing business in the back of a stretch limo. That pretty much sums up this movie.

**Best dialogue**
ELISE: There's something else I wish I could forget...
ERIC: That's my penis you smell.

5301075,5,B009AMABH6,"I've read reviews about this film being boring and pretentious but I found it to be very entertaining and it was even funny at times. The dialogue is lifted exactly from the book and it may be a bit too wordy for some, but I loved it! The stilted dialogue makes the film more surreal and dream-like. It's like the characters are in another universe. It also had a lyrical feel to it. It was like listening to a poem.

The film was both subtle and striking. I've watched it many times and each time I have a different reaction. It was the type of film that made me go home and think. It stayed on my mind until the second viewing and I had a completely different reaction then. I loved it more each time. It was a work of art.

Don't look for the fast paced thriller that you see in the trailer. I think this is why most people are not pleased with the film. They go in expecting one thing an they get another. The movie is slowly paced and can leave you feeling cold alienated and suffocated. It is about a man that doesn't seem to be in touch with reality and it will leave you feeling the same way. As the movie progresses Eric becomes more and more human.
When watching this movie you shouldn't think too hard about it or try to understand everything. You will enjoy it a whole lot more.

Cosmopolis is also actually very funny if you pay attention. I found myself laughing during at a lot of it. Mostly in the scenes with his wife. It's funny how those two are married but they don't even know each other at all. The banters between them are extremely hilarious especially their tone and how they seemed to have no idea how to talk to one another. They talk but neither one seems to be listening.

Pattinson is remarkable in a lead role where he is in almost every frame of the film, and one scene at the end with Paul Giamatti in particular is spectacular.

5301220,5,B009AMABH6,"I had read Cosmopolis and was excited to hear that Cronenberg was going to take it on.  I love when he chooses something that would seem unfilmable.  His most brilliant stroke was keeping almost all of DeLillo's dialogue from the book intact.  I have to admit that casting Pattinson in the lead role was also a surprisingly good move as Pattinson turns in a performance that's both strong and nuanced. In fairness, though, I thought all of the casting was wonderful with Binoche and Giamatti being the stand-outs for me.  (That last climactic scene between Pattinson and Giamatti is worth the price of the movie right there.)  Cronenberg is not for everyone, nor is DeLillo, but if you like movies that make you think and take you on a bit of a ride (pun intended), this is for you.

Who would have thought that an asymmetrical prostate would be the key to all of the lite-weight ideas about wealth, fame, privilege and the media and social distortion that attend those things.  But wait, maybe it's the description of how the Paul Giamatti character has constructed the solid waste disposal system in the porta-potty  that adorns his living room.  By the time I got to that point, my mind had already stopped flowing downhill. And a pet peeve; the bullet through the hand at the end might have had some shock value if I hadn't already seen it in the trailer.

5301291,4,B009AMABH6,"For reasons I may not have yet fully analyzed, I was drawn into Cosmopolis from the very beginning and it commanded my attention to the very end.  I cannot think of another film in recent memory that has held my interest at such a high level for its duration.  I may take a bit of a different view of its message.  I believe it is about a highly intelligent and successful financial/economic modeler who has made a large fortune predicting the price movement of investments.  His predictions are made using highly sophisticated computer analysis of vast amounts of information leading to ""nanosecond"" timing of investment decisions.  While he employs and consults with others, it is clear that he is the brain upon which his success was achieved.  His problem is that his financial models are run in a vacuum relative to human existence and accordingly, his life has been spent in a financial future that does not yet exist, except within his models, and it indeed may never exist outside his models.  Because his models lack any regard for humanity and his continuous view of the future is unreal, he eventually becomes depressed and sociopathic.  However, he has some recognition of what the lack of real human involvement is doing to him and begins to seek out human contact and input, but it may be too late.  He also knows that the manner in which he, and others, have made their fortunes has had a significant negative impact on society because it ignores any human impact.  The movie begins on a day when he has made unusually large investments based upon a predicted currency price outcome which could cause the collapse of his empire if he does not make a decision contrary to his model's predicted result.  I believe much of the film deals with the contradictions between a sociopath and his need for human contact and that his models do not model human existence.  I do not know if this is the gist of the filmmaker's intent, but this seemed to me to be a plausible scenario supported in varying degrees by the film's dialog and visual content.

I think Cosmopolis captured and held my attention so strongly because of my financial/economic background and the less evident underlying truths upon which the economic scenario of the film appeared to be built.  However, the film is not straightforward in its disclosure of details leading me to this view so I will not pretend to profess any ""correct"" understanding if one indeed exists.  There are reviews of this film that are negative because others found it to be too different, too difficult or lacking a plot and accordingly, the film did not capture their attention as strongly as mine.  While I may not have realized the filmmakers' intent, I remain confident that many viewers will find that it has substance beyond what those reviewers perceived.

The best adjective I could come up with to describe the film is ""interesting"".  It is far different from the average popular fare and its dialog may be difficult to grasp occasionally, but I thought Robert Pattison did a good job with a good but difficult script.  I did not notice any other significant artistic or technical pluses or minuses.  I rented this movie from Amazon and renters do not get the benefit of additional materials that may be included on the purchased DVD.  I do not usually view much of the additional materials supplied with DVDs because I usually do not need to have a film explained to me and I hold no fanatical interest.  But, in the case of Cosmopolis, some additional material concerning the film's substance might be helpful.  If you are looking for some lighter entertainment, this film does not meet your need.  However, if you happen to be in a pensive or analytical frame of mind, I would recommend Cosmopolis for at least one viewing.  I think it was a very good film.",1356048000,5,3822,4.737160120845921

Pattinson is magnetically credible,vampiric associations utilised. Pasty,weary,washed out.

De Lillo's post-modern reworking of Ulysses,inching through a day in grid-locked midtown Manhattan,Cronenburg transmutes alchemically his source material,stamping it with his own preoccupations in an affect-free world,leeched by a master of the universe,travelling in a chauffeur-driven limo to get a haircut across town. Packer triggers personal and professional disintegration,his isolation is penetrated by sex,by identity and humanity(""money has its neurotic quality""..""computers are dying""..""the urge to destroy is a creative urge"").Vija Kinski(Morton)says the markets are unstable and that he's losing all his money.

In eerie display screens data maps the world finance market. Eric has over-borrowed in the Chinese Yuan currency, bringing about his own ruin,triggering the collapse of the world's economy.

The movie is idea driven, and certainly not for everyone. I took it for what it was, a scathing indictment of modern society. A society that has turned human beings into commodities, and the human condition into an equation.

5301458,5,B009AMABH6,"There will be spoilers. This was my take on the film and just a little bit of what I took away from it. First of all, I loved this movie.  Another reviewer on here said that no one can describe what its about because its about so many things. I completely agree. Essentially, the main character is Eric Packer a multi-billionaire whos desperate to get across town to his fathers old barber. Along the way he meets with people, either employees, business associates,security personel, and his new bride whom he married for circumstance and not love. Hes a young man of 28 and for his age hes acheived much. But you get the sense that hes lost, he doesnt understand his place in the world and he thinks that somehow if he re lives a part of his life and remembers his innocence he will somehow understand his purpose. Thus, trying to go to the barber. A place of happy memories for him. Now the real meat of the story of which makes this film so interesting ; comes from all the characters he meets on his journey to the barber. They all have thier own point of view on how the world works, how its ever changing and never receding to simpler times. As technology advances, humans become more dull and dependant on the things they want rather than need. to have those things you need money. The world is obsessed with money and it makes us less human because of it. We become greedy and careless of others, we lose touch with humanity and what we should be. Since Eric has so much money he is in all actually a perfect example of what the problems with society are. When he finally meets up with a former employee named Benno Levin, he for the first time hears and at least trys to understand what its like for those of us who struggle while the rich lose touch with humanity. By this point he seems so desperate to feel some kind of emotional response to the activities,turmoil of the day he would do anything to just FEEL. Thus shooting himself in the hand. The film ends with Benno pointing a gun at the back of Erics head. We don't know if he shot Eric or not. I do know Eric didn't seem to worried about the fact that he could die. Throughout the whole movie you are trying to understand this man, why is he so paranoid that he gets a prostate exam daily? why cant he make a connection with his wife? why does it seem the only thing he does have feeling for is sex? Especially,whenthe animalistic nature of sex is for the reason to pro-create and yet,I find that ironic since he seems so morbidly curious about death; having heard about the death of a famous recording artist he favored and then later killing his body gaurd and feeling nothing.  Like I said theres so much going on in this film that every time you watch it you will come away having learned something new. Each character reveals to us a little nugget of truth about society and what we are becoming. Remember that was just my take on the film having watched it one time and reading the book twice. I do feel like this film is not really for entertainment purposes. I mean its entertaining to watch the actors performances. They are all just amazing and fabulously talented. But you really have to pay attention to dialogue in this film. You have to watch it will an open mind and open ears. Visually I really liked the cinematography. The limo was multifunctional. I was unsure how they could make each scene special when the characters are in one space for so long. But it works. i definitely reccomend it. Its not a blockbuster but if you want a taste of something different then what hollywood is churnning out, then Give Cosmopolis a try.",1353369600,8,3613,4.3991031390134525

8538474,5,B009AMABH6,"Before I begin, I must state that this movie is not for everyone and can understand the 1 star reviews.  This movie is a great dialogue driven piece that showcases Pattinson's talents.  Beautifully shot by Cronenberg, with his style painted over each frame.  At first this film had me put off but the more I ""rode"" along, the greater I appreciated the concepts laid out and how Cronenberg explored them.  I recommend giving this some time to appreciate, first viewing might be hard but worth it to view until the end.",1521072000,,517,4.648351648351649
