2570411,5,B000FKP4BU,"Remember how many top-ten lists Mysterious Skin (also starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) made last year-end? This will happen again, with BRICK. This is frequently compared with Donnie Darko, not in content but in the cult-following it garnered even tho it didn't make huge box-office waves. In fact, Brick stayed in the top ten in the UK for weeks this spring/summer. But enough PR, the film stands on its own merits, on so many levels: for its concept, script, performances, music, photography. Not to be missed.",1150243200,8,510,5.083333333333333
2570412,5,B000FKP4BU,"Closely following the literary works of Dashiell Hammet, Brick is a mystery not unlike The Maltese Falcon, but there's a twist.  This story of drugs, scandal and murder takes place in a High School in Southern California.  The writing and superb adaptation drops you into the story just like the novella the movie is based on.  At times, the poetic dialogue makes you forget that these are just kids and the subtle reminders of this fact add to the clever comedic moments.

Brick is an amazing movie.  Definately the best written movie I have ever seen. I couldn't recommend it more strongly.",1150070400,7,592,4.764705882352941
2570413,4,B000FKP4BU,"The well worn conventions of the Teen Movie, as in ""Mean Girls"" and the detective thriller, as in ""Chinatown"" or more to the point David Lynch's surreal ""Twin Peaks"" collide in the strange yet ultimately successful ""Brick,"" which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (so very good in ""Mysterious Skin"") as a teenage Sam Spade with strong overtones of Dirty Harry and equally strong low tones of Holden Caulfield. Gordon-Levitt's Brendan is determined to discover why and by whom his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emile de Ravin) was murdered.

First time director Rian Johnson exhibits a strong sense of style and an amazing finesse with his young cast: they all come off as caring, thoughtful, emotionally stable or not human beings...not gorgons or aliens as they are so often portrayed on the screen.

Besides Brendan, the other amazing creation is Lukas Hass's take as ""Pin"" (as in Kingpin): a kind of Don Corleone/Superfly character who reigns over a group of young thugs. Hass and Johnson's writing for him get very close to caricature but thankfully never quite take it all the way there.

""Brick"" and Gordon-Levitt's Brendan are refreshing, daring and astringent creations and as such are not to be missed by anyone interested in contemporary American movies.",1148083200,8,1248,5.137931034482759
2570414,5,B000FKP4BU,"Rian Johnson's ""Brick"" won a Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Festival for originality of vision, and seldom has an award been more deserved. This witty, breathlessly entertaining low-budget flick conflates modern-day high-school angst with the mean-street conventions of 1940s detective fiction and movies. The surprise is that director/screenwriter Johnson plays the story absolutely straight, and gets away with it, while at the same time touching on some uncomfortable truths about growing up in America. Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), whose delicate, poetic looks belie his limitless resources of toughness and courage, goes underground among his school's drug-addled ""upper crust"" to uncover the murderers of his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin). He endures multiple beatings from the goon Tugger (Noah Fleiss), as well as threats from both The Pin (Lukas Haas), a cadaverous criminal mastermind who still lives with his doting mother, and Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree), who basically plays the Barton McLane role to Gordon-Levitt's Bogart. Then there are the femmes fatales in training, Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good), who may or may not be helping Brendan. ""Brick"" is remarkably stylish and atmospheric for its miniscule budget; Johnson is masterful at capturing the claustrophobic milieu in which Brendan and his antagonists lurk. There are scenes of action and suspense here that put big-budget epics like ""V for Vendetta"" to shame, simply because Johnson knows how to edit, and because he makes us care about the characters, especially Brendan. I never paid much attention to Gordon-Levitt until I saw his performance as an emotionally damaged male prostitute in Gregg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin."" Based on his performances here and in that film, I would say that Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of the truly great American screen actors. All the other actors are also fine, including Matt O'Leary as The Brain, Brendan's informant and only true friend, and Noah Segan as the pathetic ""reef worm"" Dode. Some critics have complained about ""Brick's"" convoluted plot and stylized dialogue--Johnson creates a language for his characters that is half Chandleresque slang, half teen speak. But for me they only added to the film's fascination. You'll probably need to see the film more than once to catch all the details, but, then again, you'll WANT to see it more than once. Myself, I can't wait for the DVD to come out.",1148083200,50,2481,5.380462724935732

2570420,5,B000FKP4BU,"Just caught this again at a revival theater and I was reminded how good this movie really is. Joseph Gordon Levitt is definitely the anchor here, demonstrating astounding acting chops and providing some nuance to what could easily have been a flat, stereotyped role. But Johnson pulls strong performances from every actor in here, throwing in a good plot and stylish direction as well. A really great revisit/reinvention to the noir genre.",1502582400,,439,5.111111111111111

2570424,5,B000FKP4BU,"I absolutely loved this modern take on the classic film noir. The contemporary setting of a modern high school presents all the typical film noir character archetypes with great performances from the young cast.

2570428,5,B000FKP4BU,"Boy, am I late to this party. I actually saw this outstanding ""high school noir"" on DVD not long after it came out. I didn't know JGL (Joseph Gordon Levitt), helmer Rian Johnson or even indie films that well. What a difference over ten years makes. But, the passage of time has not dulled the sharp edges of this supremely edgy crime thriller, set and filmed, interestingly, in the very high school Rian Johnson himself attended. JGL plays Brendan whose not-recently-ex-girlfriend appears to leave him a note to be at a certain intersection at a certain time, where a payphone (yes a payphone, nice touch) rings, whereby said ex breathlessly downloads the primary plot elements in cryptic ""high-school underground-speak"". Just wonderful. Is she a prisioner of the ""Pin"" (played to perfection by Lukas Haas), and who is ""Tug"" and what is this ""Brick"" she is talking about? The answers to those questions, such as they are provide the motive force for this delightful romp. Cast of relatively unknown supporting players are all great, but JGL and Haas make this film, along with the brilliant neo-noir dialogue, direction and remarkably inventive camerawork, and wonderful film score written with old-school noir charm by Johnson's brother. Great stuff.",1491868800,7,1251,5.107317073170732

2570456,3,B000FKP4BU,"I had high hopes for this film. But...The premise was trying to mix a Raymond Chandler like dialogue with a high school mentality. I could see what the writer/directors was trying to do but in the end, the dialogue was so unreal it made the film lose its sense of reality and its suspense. I love a good mystery and this one had promise but the school lingo-unlike any I've heard was too distracting, especially with the old detective (think Humphrey Bogart) like delivery. Interesting photography but over all, it does not work well. I give it 3 stars mainly because I like Gordon Levitt.",1468713600,,589,4.619047619047619

You have to watch those to get the dialogue and the monologue. I recommend ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"", which is Steve Martin's spoof where he incorporates actual footage from the originals. It plays into this move as well.

The acting is pretty good, not amazing. And the story is out of site for teenagers / high schoolers. But again, it is based on adult themed movies from the 40's and 50's.",1467072000,,514,4.586956521739131

2570480,5,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a classic detective story told in a new light. Following the story of a loner high school student named Brendan Frye (Joseph-Gordon Levitt - Inception, The Dark Knight Rises) that receives a desperate call from his former girlfriend. After hearing of Emily Kostich's (Emilie de Ravin - Lost, Once Upon a Time) troubles Brendan descends into the dark underworld of high school drug dealing to find out who put Emily in danger and make them face true justice.
  This look at an intelligent loner high schooler as the detective in a high school mystery gives a much needed unique perspective on the truly underused classic detective story. By having the classic ""Brute"", ""Distracting Femme"", ""Crime Lord"" and ""Innocent but stupid druggie"" cast with a younger group we can see this roles in an entirely new light. Complemented with excellent dialogues, and music that is reminiscent of a true detective story, you will be kept guessing as to who the true villain is, and if Brendan has any chance of ""coming out of this clean"".
  To give this unique and brilliant story any less than 4 stars would truly be a sin, brought on by ignorance of the beauty of the story, or some personal prejudice against the type of story, actors or actresses, or writer. Judge for yourself as you give this 110 Minutes of brilliant creativity your attention, and be sure to watch again to catch the small details you may have missed. I hope you enjoy this story as much as I do every time I re-watch it.",1463184000,2,1489,4.67175572519084

It rarely gets better than this. If you are a fan of Noir that is, if not....well you probably won't enjoy the movie, or understand the loving homage of the genre. And I think Joseph Gordon Levitt channels Bogie wonderfullly. Love this movie, it is going into my permanent watch-at-least-once-a-year-collection. Unfortunately this will probably never even hit cult status. It's brilliant, but even some of the noir lovers out there won't like their beloved genre set in a high school and with a cast of supposed high schoolers., and that is really too bad because this movie never steps a hair out or over the line.

Holy smokes, was it worth the $5!  Everything about this movie is terrific.  The plot is a twisting murder-mystery that leaves you guessing, the actors are perfectly cast, and the dialogue is an utterly inventive blend of 40s slang and modern speech.  It gives the movie a timeless feel, and listening to the actors deliver it is incredibly fun.  I don't think Bogie and Bacall had better lines.

2570510,4,B000FKP4BU,"A lot of reviewers have nailed this one -- a 21st Century high-school setting for what is an old-fashioned film noir.  A good bit of the pleasure is hearing that older vibe in the background while fresh-faced kids do the deadpan stuff.  The plot has a good woman gone bad, a bad woman seeming to go good (Nora Zehetner), a gumshoe with a sidekick who helps him figure things out (""Brain"") and who is a lot handier with his mitts than you expect.  The plot is complicated in the ways that are usual in movies where nobody knows (including some bad actors) whom to trust, and the gumshoe is a bit of a sap for what the older movies would call a dame . . . It's all very entertaining.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very effective as Brendan, the gumshoe figure, and Lukas Haas (remember the little boy in ""Witness""?) is excellent as The Pin (the character who in an older movie would have been The Boss or Mr Big).  Then there's Tug, the muscle who isn't too bright (Noah Fleiss) and a variety of genre types, including memorably the addict Dode (Noah Segan).  In a nice touch, not only have the ages of the noir characters been changed but instead of the gloomy, threatening urban setting of so many of the original noirs, this one is in sunny Southern California, and when we go into dark places, they are obviously basements of one-level California suburban homes.  And Rian Johnson, who wrote and directed, deserves a lot of credit for his script -- he has to come up with a kind of argot that sounds contemporary while still evoking the laconic short-hand dialogue of the earlier noirs.  Tonally, he doesn't put a foot wrong, and the actors carry it off with great fluency and apparent naturalness.  So . . . it's lots of fun.  Give it a try.",1426723200,,1739,4.457413249211356

Yet I did find the basic concept of a ""high school neo-noir"" interesting. At the time, I probably would have rated it 3 stars. But something happened... I couldn't get the movie out of my head! I kept thinking about it and talking about it. So, inevitably, I watched it again. This time I knew what to expect and was prepared. I followed the plot better and found the characters more likable.

2570519,5,B000FKP4BU,"The people who gave the film a 1-star rating keep complaining that the dialogue is awkward. I think the dialogue is funky and requires a certain effort to get into, which makes this movie the kind that you should watch sitting down instead of occasionally poke your head out for from the kitchen (or the office, etc.)

The plot is curious, and the characters are fetching, in different ways. And as much as I don't like movies about teenagers, this one feels almost adult in its content. The investigation that the main character conducts is done in a quirky way, just as the main character himself is.

I think the movie is mesmerizing. The art shots, the trans-inducing flow of the film, the dialogue, the actors. I have watched this movie many times, and had to get it on DVD so I can watch more of it for years to come.",1417392000,,823,4.443708609271523

2570522,5,B000FKP4BU,"I've never seen any other movie set completely in a High School that I found as engaging and compelling as this one.  The main characters are all teens, but it does not feel like a teen movie.  It is a hard-hitting noir film, full of drug issues and gang violence and murder. It is also full of undying love, true friendship, betrayal and loyalty, amateur detective work, bravery and brilliance.

The script is fast-paced and full of slang, which makes it hard to follow sometimes. But when you do catch on to their slang and rythms of speech, it is poetic in every sense of the word.

I love this movie because I identified with the main character so strongly.  I was the nerdy loner with a habit of falling in love with damsels in distress who didn't want to be rescued.  The characters in this story are so vivid and alive, and the plot is so complex and well designed, I think this movie is one of the greatest masterpieces I've ever seen.

But if you don't have the connection I have with the character, or if you have too much trouble following the rapid slang of their conversations, you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did.  I strongly suggest renting the movie, in case you love it like I did. But rent it first, don't buy it until you've seen it, because it has the makings of a cult classic that some people will not enjoy at all.",1416182400,,1346,4.313492063492063

There are many scenes in which you just have to absorb the mood and the feel of the atmosphere, or the expression on the actor's face -- much like the artwork in a Manga.  Clearly, these events couldn't take place in real life, so you have to suspend your belief in the daily lives of real high school students.

The downsides however are twofold; One, the only release is a combo pack with the DVD so while not a bad deal, the price is always going to be higher than just a standard Blu-Ray release. Two, the Blu-Ray is barebones for no reason. The only thing the Blu-Ray has on it is the film, while the dvd has the 20+ minutes of deleted/extended scenes, a featurette and a commentary track.

This attempt at the hard-boiled detective genre features adolescents constantly, tediously spouting a stylized jargon which is mostly unintelligible.

2570551,3,B000FKP4BU,"This is an interesting film, it tells the story of a college kid investigating the death of his ex-girlfriend. What makes it stand out is that the film is presented in the style of film noir, with the teenager in the role of a gumshoe detective. It's a nice idea and follows a similar plot to the investigations with a few twists and turns along the way.

Everyone does a good job in their roles, in particular the lead. Without the style gimmick it's a solid enough film, everyone plays their part and the story unfolds at a decent pace. The style does set it apart, but also proves it undoing.

The issue is that it comes across as a student film with the kids playing roles of the noir style. It's well filmed which does set it up a step higher than that, but still the impression remains. While it does present an interesting juxtaposition it did hamper my enjoyment somewhat.

That leaves it as a film that's a bit tricky to rate, it's a decent enough film, but not as entertaining as it might have been. Still it's not a bad watch by any means and it does stand apart from many other teen movies, so worth checking out.",1380412800,,1125,4.322274881516588

2. Smart acting and mental fencing.
3. Awesome dialogue and flow.
4. Great ensemble power. (Roundtree?!?)...
5. Taken as a fantasy workup, it actually lays down clear rules (and obeys them!).
  In short, this is a good thriller/whodunnit with (as noted elsewhere) crazy-smart dialogue and tension games.  It is one of my favorite modern films.  If you can transpose yourself into the realm presented, you will love it.  Gordon-Levitt is also grand in Premium Rush (which was another I almost passed over).

2570558,5,B000FKP4BU,"Like the Coen Brothers' The Big Lebowski, Rian Johnson's freshmen feature makes a neo-noir tale by putting characters who you wouldn't expect to see in a mystery film into film-noir situations. With some great performances (including a slyer than ever Joseph Gordon Levitt) and slickly witty slang dialogue, Johnson takes a seemingly simple premise and adds some innovative flavor to create a deadly original yarn.
Brendan (Levitt), having recently discovered the corpse of an old lover, plays the role of detective in search for answers. On the way to the truth, he crosses paths with a seemingly perfect damsel, a manipulative school theater actress, a cool brainiac, an overheated muscle for a young crime syndicate, and a cane-toting coat-wearing drug kingpin (and his mother).
Featuring crisp dialogue, atmospheric cinematography, organicly sparse music, and a downright cool style, Brick is a force to be reckoned with, and a refreshingly original take on the neo-noir genre.
As for the R-Rating, I'm almost confused as to why the film was rated so harshly. There is no cursing, little violence, and while the drug content is integral to the story no drug use is ever actually portrayed on the film (other than cigarette smoking). In my opinion the film should have gotten a PG-13 from the MPAA.
About the DVD: Great transfer, clear picture, great sound. Focus Features has a way with making all of their products very well. Bonus features include a cast and crew commentary, twenty minutes of deleted scenes, and a documentary about the casting.",1371600000,,1552,5.1141732283464565

Love this movie. The characters talk in a way in which what they mean is not immediately apparent, every phrase has to be analysed, definitely a movie that needs viewed multiple times for full effect.

Numerous interesting quirks to notice in the film, for instance, you only see three ""adults"" in the entire length of it, all the rest of the players are high school students (with the exception of the Pin, his mother, and the Truman, the VP).

I wish there were a bit less violence, but it's rated R so the viewer is warned.

I stand by that. I think it accurately sums up this movie. Went into Brick with high expectations and was blown away. The main character is outstanding. His acting is daring and had me yelling at the screen at least twice. To say the least, I got emotionally involved in his circumstances.

Like Pulp Fiction, this is a movie I wish I could un-see, so that I could watch it again for the first time. The ending is climatic and twisted. I loved the characters, they seemed so complete.

I found the movie very interesting and even riveting at times. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a terrific talent and has a very bright future. When I was watching this I could not help but reflect back upon my own high school experience. Maybe I lived a pretty sheltered life. I love documentary films because they deal in reality, and credibility ranks high upon my requirements for a good 'fiction' movie, at least a good crime or drama. Not so sure how high this one would rank on the credibility scale. I kept wondering if we would ever see a parent--aside from The Pin's dutiful mother--and I wondered if the kids ever went to biology class or algebra or social studies. But when you consider that the writer has basically fashioned a 40's-era LA crime noir but used a modern California high school as the setting, you start to get it.
After all, they're constantly updating Romeo and Juliet and other Shakespeare plays, so why can't they do it with this one? Give it a chance; I would suppose that younger viewers might be more open to it. But oldsters like me might get hung up on the believability aspect. It's difficult to imagine high-schoolers being this sophisticated, or devious, but if you suspend your sense of credibility and let the story take you along, you might enjoy it.

2570575,2,B000FKP4BU,"Film noir has to be one of my favorite genres in the realm of story weaving. As a mixture of crime drama, mystery, German expressionism, thriller, melodrama and even a few drops of horror film noir has had a presence in cinema since the 1940s.  I do not proclaim myself a film noir expert per se, but I have seen plenty of films in this category to be a fair judge of what is good and what is not.  The best analogy I have for this film is being on a date with a woman who is beautiful and dripping with sex appeal yet has no depth or substance whatsoever.

The 2005 film ""Brick"" would be considered a ""neo-noir"" film, mainly being a modern film noir omitting the ""black and white"" and some of the day old norms of the 1940s and 1950s. The plot revolves around Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a high school student who is trying to solve the disappearance/murder of his estranged girlfriend Emily.  Brendan jumps down an interesting ""rabbit hole"" and uncovers many layers in his quest to resolve this conundrum. The grapples or ""layers"" Brendan tackles consist, but are not limited to, drug dealers, police, murder, fights and the proverbial femme fatal.

These all seem like prolific standards for a noir film, yet I found this film to be rather lacking in cohesiveness and believability. The movie is about high school students, not one single scene involves a classroom.  In addition, these high school students in many ways act more like adults.  Another odd aspect about these ""high school"" students is their dialect is a hybrid of adolescent jargon and an anachronistic tongue of an era long gone. I do appreciate the ode to classic noir by having our ""anti-hero"" calling a girl; excuse me dame ""angel"" but it seems odd to have a high school student doing this.  To piggy back this notion; there is a scene where ""The Pin"", a drug czar played by Lukas Haas, is having a meeting with his peers while his mother is serving snacks and drinks.  Perhaps this is black comedy but I found it totally preposterous.

Another problem area with this film is the opening scene. Technically, the framing and cinematography are breathtaking, as is the score.  Brendan is standing in front of a storm drain looking at Emily, who appears to be dead.  Then the scene cuts stating ""two days prior"", I had the assumption that the opening of the film would also serve as the climax.  Sadly we the viewers are brought back to the storm drain scene within twenty minutes of the motion picture.  A perfect story set up ruined for the next ninety minutes seem bloated and expedited at the same time.

Furthermore, there were way too many characters in this movie and the cant and code names made it difficult at times to keep up with the story. Perhaps I felt this way because a vast majority of the dialogue was mumbled in this movie. Once the climax came and we the viewers figure out ""who was behind it all"" I felt somewhat let down.  It was as if the ending was too standard for a film noir.

On a positive note, the acting was very good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a really fine job as our anti-hero; with the material he was given, as did Nora Zehetner.  The mood was also very stark and bare, great for a film noir. .  The lighting and cinematography was also on point.  As for the score, well let's just say I purchased it as soon as the end credits were rolling.  The problem with this movie was the direction of the story.  The story was not bad but the execution was very lazy and lacked focus, which translated to a very elongated viewing. I personally feel that if the high school angle was omitted and/or reworked, the story became a bit more simplified and the ending wasn't quite so trite this film could have been the standard all neo-noirs should live up to.",1328659200,4,3756,4.51698670605613
2570576,5,B000FKP4BU,"All the familiar characters are present, but the setting and jargon has been updated to an affluent Southern California high school. If you are fascinated or intrigued by noir, or film genres and conventions, give this a try! The writing is excellent, and for all that there's plenty of California sunshine, there's plenty of dark, brooding atmosphere. JGL is naturally marvelous, inhabiting his character with all the miserable defensiveness of a teenager who doesn't want to play the game but is forced into it anyway. While the dialogue may seem overly artificial, it's not humorless; there's one fantastic scene that embraces the banality of suburbia in the midst of gangster delusions of grandeur.

2570578,3,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a stylish modern day noir which uniquely uses high school students as its main stars (although students aren't exactly going to class that much). Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) begins his quest to discover the whys of his ex-girlfriend's death.  The film begins with him receiving a mysterious call from Emily, her stating that she is ""in trouble."" Snooping around, and enlisting his friend Brain for clues, Brendan encounters some shady types around the high school as he gets closer to the darker truth of her end, and becomes involved in a dangerous drug world.

While I loved the attempt to make this a modern day noir, somehow it just didn't work that well. For one, although the rhythm of the dialogue is quick, face-paced, and snappy, it seems like the characters are just saying lines rather than really acting. They keep the mood of a hard-broiled noir intact, but the dialogue is devoid of any real meaning. Secondly, half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying. Even with subtitles, the lingo is just way too over the top and distracting (one reviewer said it best, sort of ""hipster noir""....i.e. ""I've got knives in my eyes."" translation: ""I have a bad headache."")Even as homage to noir, the dialogue goes around in circles without really making any sense or having much power. Finally, it takes way too long for this story to get going, and the 110 minutes for the amount of ""real story"" is way too long. It was painstaking to wait for key plot events to surface, and mysteries to be unraveled. When it finally does get going with Brendan encountering various thugs and bad dudes , the story does get more interesting, but it need not take that long to get there.

2570581,5,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a fast paced film that bears watching repeatedly. (It can be viewed here on Amazon.com -- free with Amazon Prime.) The online transfer is good with a clear and intelligible soundtrack -- but the noir slang may not be familiar to most.

I liked it enough that I bought the DVD. The extras are a mixed bag; the commentary track is a mess and other than telling us the film was totally filmed in San Clemente, California, it is just a curiosity. The deleted scenes are good, and the two ""screen tests"" are ok.

The real value of the DVD is in the English subtitles. (Spanish & French subtitles are also included.)

I've included the IMDb.com slang list for this film, because reading it on IMDb reveals plot:

Blow - To leave, depart; e.g., ""Did she blow last night?""

Brick - A term used to describe a pound or kilogram of any drug, in the case of this film its heroin.

Bulls - Cops; e.g., ""What first, tip the bulls?"" Also, as a verb, to turn over to the cops; e.g., ""I bulled the rat.""

Burg (or Burgh) - Town, City; e.g., ""He knows every two-bit toker in the burg.""

C - Roman numeral for 100; e.g., ""He had a C-Note.""

Clam - To keep your mouth shut e.g., ""The muscle blows or I'll clam.""

Copped - Obtained; e.g., ""She copped the junk.""

Dose - To take drugs e.g., ""He dosed off the bad junk and it laid him out.""

Duck Soup - Easy pickings.

Gat - Gun.

Gum - To mess things up; e.g., ""Bulls would only gum it.""

Heel - To walk away from (and show your heels to); e.g., ""I'm not heeling you to hook you.""

Hook - Raise interest or get involved; e.g. ""I'm not heeling to hook you.""

Hop/Jake/Junk - Drugs. Back when noir films were more popular, (1940's-50's); hop is often used to reference marijuana and ""hophead"" is someone who smokes a lot of pot.

Knives in my eyes - a splitting headache; e.g., ""I've got knives in my eyes. I'm going home sick.""

Lap Dog - A lap dog is defined as a dog that is small enough to be held in the arms or lay comfortably on a person's lap. The term is also sometimes used to describe a person who is very easily controlled, such as a yes man. In the case of Brick both definitions are cleverly combined. If you recall the scene where we first meet Kara, she has a freshman boys head in her lap, who springs to her command of ""run and get my purse.""

On the Nail - immediately; e.g., ""He wants cash on the nail.""

Pick - A ride in a car (as in ""pick-up""); e.g., ""Did she get a pick?""

Raise - To get in touch with; e.g., ""You couldn't raise em?"" This is also used cleverly when Brain asks Brendan, ""You couldn't raise her?"" referring to Emily whom he could neither contact nor raise, as in raise from the dead.

Reef Worm - A stoner (reefer).

Scape - A patsy to take the blame (scapegoat/ fall guy).

Scraped - Begged off of, cadged from; e.g., ""Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang and they'll say they scraped it off [name]...""

Shamus - A private detective.

Shine - To wield (as with a weapon); e.g., ""He shines a blade.""

Showing Your Ace - Obviously a card reference. An ace is the highest playing card, meaning 'high-quality. When Brendan strips Kara and says ""I'm showing your ace,"" he is saying that Kara's most valuable asset is her beauty, which she uses to manipulate people with (e.g. lap dogs, Dode, etc). Not to mention, ace sounds similar to ass, something else of hers he shows off.

Specks - Eyes or Eyeglasses (spectacles); e.g., ""Keep your specks peeled.""

Sprang - Originated; e.g., ""His gat sprang from Tugger's gang.""

Squawk - To give up or snitch on. Or more apt to this, a stool pigeon.

Take A Powder - To slip away; e.g., ""Why'd you take a powder the other night?""

Yegg - A criminal.

Too bad the list isn't on the DVD; but check out the IMDb entry for more goodies.",1316822400,2,3747,4.253182461103253
2570582,4,B000FKP4BU,"""Brick"" is a daring piece of crime cinema that revolves around a certain subculture at a high school.  There are only two adult characters in the movie: the vice principal and someone's mother. The lack of adults in the movie, however, lends a gravity to the film and its characters.  At no time is anyone seen in class.  Everything, for the most part, takes place outside the school proper: in the parking lot; on the football field; in a dressing room; near a remote outbuilding (where the main character, Bredan [a loner], has his lunch [and where someone has his or her lunch is a point of distinction brought out several times).  Beyond the school grounds, much of the story transpires in and around a few houses.  The absence of adults, however, lends credulity to the story and let's the audience experience what serious business all these high schoolers are up to.

The movie begins with Brendan's discovery of his ex-girlfriend Emilie lying dead in a drainage ditch, after which there is a flashback two days into the past, when he receives a panicked call from her asking him for help.  What transpires from that point on is a story of drugs, murder, deception, discovery and revenge.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie.  In homage to old film noir and gumshoe movies, the characters speak with the vernaculars of Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart and Edmond O'Brien, using words like ""sap,"" ""clam"" and other such throwbacks.  In fact, the dialogue is reminiscent of a Shakespeare play, where you don't quite get into the lingo groove for a third of the performance, after which everything that's said because much more clear.  This, unfortunately, is sometimes undermined by frequently mumbled lines from the actors, who all do a fabulous job notwithstanding.

While it might be hard to apply ""accept the premise, accept the bit"" to this film, its far-fetched setting, goings-on and cast of characters were nevertheless a joy to experience.  ""Brick"" is a refreshing entry into the murder-mystery genre.",1314576000,,2013,4.902654867256637
2570583,5,B000FKP4BU,"What more can you say than that this is the best, most masterfully executed translation of the classic noir genre into any other period?

The script is breathtakingly smooth in its fully and unapologetically stylized manner. The characters play their characters gorgeously, and the few moments where the noir facade is broken to point out that these are, theoretically, teenagers (when the mob boss' mother serves the protagonist a glass of milk before they get down to talking the business of drugs, crime, and espionage) work wonderfully to complement the mood.

To make it perfectly clear: this is not a movie attempting to be in any way realistic. It is completely and utterly stylized. Perhaps best compared with Rian Johnson's other film, Brothers Bloom, which is introduced by a sequence describing the brothers' childhood and beginning as con men in a kind of tall tale/folk tale rhyme. Each film lives in a world which follows very different rules than our own, but a world which is constructed with incredible skill and delicacy.

Brick is entirely self-aware, and it weaves a deliciously dark tale of treachery, crime, passion, manipulation, and tragic downfall all set among teenagers in an average Californian high school. A classic I'm sure I'll re-watch countless times as I make sure all my best friends have seen it.",1313539200,,1333,5.05

And that strange Halloween party with the cryptic ""performances"" - where did that take place? Some rich kid's house with the parents gone?

Half the time I could not hear, let alone understand the use of English...if it was English. After the first 15 minutes, I started fast forwarding through the movie and just watched the scenes. You can pretty much get the idea of this movie without hearing a single word. It was like a bunch of young Californites with too much money and time on their hands decided to make a film that would piss of their parents.

The main antagonists in the movie are masochists doped out on lithium or pot - maybe both. The only parent is portrayed as an oblivious  ""Leave it to Beaver"" pleaser.  The only other authority figure is a vice principal who comes across as narcotics detective negotiating with his street contact.

2570588,5,B000FKP4BU,"`Brick' is one of those films that has aged very well with me.  I remember when I first say it and I really liked it a lot.  Over time I had forgotten just how much I liked this until I happened to catch it a while back and became instantly absorbed in it once again.  With dialog as fresh and sharp as the words expressed in `Juno', yet more residual thanks to the noir'ish themes, `Brick' just `gets it'.

I love the feel of `Brick'.  This is a film that knows what it wants to be.  It indulges in and totally embraces the thickly detailed atmosphere that makes it stand alone, apart from comparables.  The film never feels amateurish or `silly'.  Instead, it balances the absurd details of the surroundings by elevating the core themes, keeping each character believable as apposed to a cleverly inserted caricature.

Rian Johnson is just, well, awesome.

Taking place mainly on school grounds, `Brick' tells the story of Brendan, a curious teen who gets a message from his girlfriend claiming to need help.  Taking that message and running with it, Brendan finds himself deep in high-school crime, and when his girlfriend shows up dead, things get even stickier for Brendan as he meets and evaluates a variety of teens dwelling in the school's underbelly.  Drugs and murder fester as Brendan steps closer to the truth, eluded by a mysterious girl named Laura and a drug kingpin known as The Pin.

Thank you Joseph Gordon-Levitt for being the acting god that you are.  I can't wait for the whole world to embrace you as `the next best thing' and for you to completely make the cinematic world your breeding grounds.  Seriously, is there anything this kid can't do?  As Brendan, Gordon-Levitt adds so much weight to the films premise, aiding Brendan with a subtle edge that makes him believable and relatable.  Megan Good and Mike O'Leary are also great; but it is Nora Zehetner, as rich girl Laura, who stays with me the longest.  She was just outstanding, layering her characters mysteriousness with richly conceived moments that spark our interest.

Thanks to a poetic script and a sharp directorial eye, `Brick' is the new age noir that understands how to pay homage without feeling like a cheaply disguised copycat.  No, this is not the best noir ever (as some presumptuous teens have tried to claim) but it is one of the smartest takes on the genre in years.  The noir is a hard genre to master, but `Brick' just oozes with enough charm and originality to take the cake here.

Fascinating is a word that best describes this film.",1299024000,2,2537,4.679458239277652

2570590,5,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a modern day film noir set in a high school in California. That may, or may not, attrack people to this movie. For some, like me, who really don't care about the film noir genre of the 40's and 50's (mostly because of the outlandish characters and over the top plots) may find this a refreshing alternate on that genre. Sure the characters speak in a way that's not like real life, but the true gem of this movie is it's brilliant storytelling with likeable characters that don't seem too far fetched.
Brendan is the loner (only after Emily leaves him) who seems to know how the world works, but keeps himself away from it unless he needs it. Emily is the femme fatale who wants in on the upper crowds, but gets herself into more than she can handle. Tug is the muscle without a brain. The pin is the crimeboss with some quirky personality traights.
This movie is definately one worth watching just to see the spin that is put onto the characters, for instance: a scene that involves Brendan being treated to a meal by the Pin's mother just after he was beaten in their cellar. It's an interesting idea and works incredibly well for the tone of the movie.

There's some negative reviews out there, and that's fine, but from a few that I read, it seems as though a lot of people weren't aware of the parodic stance of the film.

I will give this warning out to people who have yet to see ""Brick"": you cannot be a passive viewer.  The dialogue is fast and littered with jive, the story takes a lot of turns, and the story has a pretty quick tempo.  If you wait for it to come to you, you'll be left in the cold.

2570594,1,B000FKP4BU,"In this movie, all the characters use a kind of slang that tries to sound poetic, but sounds like gibberish instead.  Below are two examples:

Example # 1

DODE -- Heel it now, dig?
BRENDAN -- Throw one at me if you want, hash-head.  I got all five senses and I slept last night.  That puts me six-up on the lot of you.""

Example # 2

BRENDAN -- I need you to op.  Like on Jerr, but that was cake to this, and unlike Jerr, there's not much chance of coming out clean.  24/7 on this one.  You okay to op for me again?
BRAIN -- So what first, tip the bulls?
BRENDAN -- No.  Bulls would gum it.  They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes, probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one.  But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes.""

And on and on like this.  The dialog is awkward, but so, too, are the actors saying these lines.  I sensed they didn't understand this gibberish either, resulting in lines recited with either too much emotion or too little (and mostly too little).

I don't mind writers playing with language or using double-meanings, as long as it's done sparingly. The bending of language didn't feel playful.  It felt elitist...like someone using jargon to appear smarter than everyone else.

Not only was the elitist language trying too hard, but so, too, was the overly stylized camera shots and lighting. Out of nowhere, you'll get really close-up camera shots and dark scenes with only the face lit.  Again, I don't mind playing with the norm, but because it was so abrupt, it felt jarring rather than clever.

Because this movie had more flash than substance , I couldn't connect with the story or the characters. The story starts with Brendan trying to solve Em's mystery, but after awhile, I stopped caring if he solved it or not. And I'm someone who loves a good mystery.",1282608000,24,1860,4.476190476190476

2570596,5,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a not a film as much as a symphony where each instrument is tuned to the beat of the conductor. Each frame is carefully orchestrated and composed to perfection. The dialogue is metered and spoken with a contemporary Shakespearean beat. Writer/Director Rian Johnson has created poetry with his first feature length film. It may be tough to understand the lingo and overall speech used, but as the film advances you begin to know the characters and the words just make complete sense.

We open with the stare of our protagonist--hard and piercing, yet on the verge of tears--eyes slowly welling up as he peers down on a motionless body, facedown in a tunnel's steady, flowing stream. This is film noir at its best: wrong men and notorious women. Our leader into this underbelly of society has recently rolled on his boss to skate clean of a drug deal he was involved with. The cops allow this plea and decide to keep him in their pocket, with what happened as leverage. He stays low, nose clean, until an old love brings him into her world as it's spiraling out of control. Using all his resources around the city, he begins his search to find her and make sure she is OK. He does this for his own means, with a stoicism that hearkens back to Bogart's Sam Spade.

Wait...Did I tell you that the city this is set in is a suburban high school? Johnson has flipped the genre on its head to brilliant effect. Brendan, our medium into the story, is played to perfection by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a senior at the school who has alienated himself by ratting on his drug supplier. The vice-principal is using him to gain intel on the dealings around school, but Brendan will have none of it. He needs to find out what happened to his old flame Emily and see what she got involved in. Enlisting the help of a colleague, Brendan plays his enemies off each other to gain access to the mob boss and dope runner The Pin (""I hear he's supposed to be old, like 26""), whom Emily has wronged. The truth must be found at all costs, either to assuage some personal guilt, to rescue love, to do what's right, to get the bad guys, or maybe all the above. The search for answers leads to betrayal and secrets uncovered and I was there for the entire ride.

Brick is not the 21st century's answer to Alan Parker's Bugsy Malone. This isn't a satire on mob life with children playing men. This is a reawakening of the genre, a subversion of what you expect of it, but played straight as a razor. None of these actors break character and lines like this, echoing a hardened criminal telling off an over-zealous officer, ""No more of these informal chats! If you have a disciplinary issue with me, write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the Parent-Teacher conference,"" are delivered with straight faces and a piercing confidence. The wit is there and you will laugh to the seeming absurdity, but the weight of the story holds strong. Well-placed humor helps you realize the gravity of everything even more.

Levitt shines in the role and proves to be the best up-and-coming actor of his generation. Following pitch-perfect turns as a violent teen in the wonderful Manic and as a teenage hustler, vagrant in Gregg Araki's disturbing yet unforgettable Mysterious Skin, Levitt is making bold choices and continues a great run with Brick. He is flanked with solid support from ""Lost's"" Emilie de Ravin as his lost love; Lukas Hass as The Pin, with loyalty straying muscle Noah Fleiss; Matt O'Leary's The Brain, Brendan's life-line to what's happening as he sinks deeper; and Nora Zehetner flawlessly playing the femme fatale which one can never be sure whether to trust. Also, the accompanying score of piano and brass jazz fits perfectly to the atmosphere, especially on a late scene close-up shot of Levitt and Zehetner--faces close- up, lips with an atom of air between them, and a single tear slowly following down the contours of her face--uncannily mimicking the infamous shot of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca.

Any cinephile with $8 to spend will regret missing an opportunity to see this film. If you love film noir of the 50's, 60's, and 70's check Brick out while you can. Doubtful that it will stay up more than 2 or 3 weeks, it will be coming to DVD on August 8th, however go out and see this gem. It will not be everyone's cup of tea, but whether you love it or not, it holds a place on the timeline of cinema as an experiment in stripping down the essence of noir and showing it in a new and no longer angelic world of children on the cusp of adulthood.

A high-school student gets a cryptic call from an ex, and when she turns up dead a few days later, he launches his own investigation into the matter. Matters spiral from there.

I call this ""hard-boiled high school"" because it ingeniously takes a standard pulp setting and updates it to a modern high school: instead of the D.A. breathing down the detective's neck, it's the vice-principal, etc. Clever stuff.

The plot's complexity is almost Chandleresque and requires paying attention to dialogue and background details. The dialogue is straight out of a '30s copy of that pulp classic, Black Mask magazine. Hammett would be proud, especially since some of the slang is encased in some truly witty dialogue.

You have to like this sort of thing, of course, but if you do, it's surprisingly well-done, especially given the limited budget and that this was the director's first effort.

One other oddity I noticed: it's rated R, and yet I'm fairly sure I heard not a single obscenity, something that even some PG movies have. There was barely a hint of sex, and no exposed skin.

2570605,4,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is not an easy film to take. It's a picture where if you choose to place yourself within the realms of reality, your going to find yourself hopelessly lost within this film's framework. The film is a High School film but not in the conventional sense. It's not a period piece, but is in a contemporary setting. The characters and dialouge are not the way real High School kids may talk, but that's not the point of the world created.

What this film is supposed to present is the world of classic Film Noir in a setting not very usual. If you can accept the fact of kids talking in 30s and 40s idiomatics than you'll be able to appreciate the picture.

The plot is a familiar one to fans of this dark genre: a young man is searching for the murderer of his girlfriend and is caught in a world of betrayal, murder and madness. It's amazing how captivating the film is and it looks like it was fun to do, since the dialouge, which may be laborious for some, is justifiably cool and absolutely fun to hear.

The characters are very engaging including a terrific lead performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has clearly left his ""Third Rock From The Sun"" days far behind him. He's effective as the loner, able to meld the right combination of world weariness and charisma to make the audience follow his story.

He's supported by a fine cast, all representing the genre's archetypes including the lovely Nora Zehetner as the requisite femme fatale who's got a thing for our hero. Her refreshing mixture of sexiness and vulnerability keeps her character sympathetic throughout. There's Noah Fleiss as the thuggish strong man of the town's leading drug dealer and he brings a suitable mixture of insanity and agression to his cliched role.
Top acting honors though must go out to Lukas Haas who portrays the flamboyant drug dealer ""the Pin"", a role the young actor plays with a suitable sense of dramatic bravado.

Direction is top notch and fast paced, the film rarely missing a beat as it moves through it's jagged and rough plot. The film at times comes dangerously close to being too self indulgent, but is able to walk it's tightrope with relative ease.

The DVD features some interesting extras including director's commentary(quite humorous actually) and deleted scenes. Nothing crucial, but interesting nonetheless.
The film is not for everyone, but for those willing to take a chance and if you have appreciation for the classic films of the Crime genre, you may find yourself enjoying this little indie sleeper.",1240617600,3,2522,4.7465753424657535

It becomes his obsession to find out who killed her and why; he will stop at nothing to find out the truth.

An admirable attempt at updating the famous film noir genre, Brick is both entertaining and innovative (as much as a film can be that mimicks an older genre). In the beginning it seems a bit gimmicky but as the story moves along, the actors fall into their roles and the story flows nicely. It features trademarks of noir (the femme fatal, corrupt characters, violence, deception, flashback, fast talk and slang) but updates the genre to modern issues. We actually see some of the violence and the drugs; nothing is sugarcoated.

The movie isn't entirely realistic, but that isn't the point. It is highly stylized and mapped out.

2570612,4,B000FKP4BU,"""Brick"" is an edgy, roughly cut film, shot on a shoestring.  Director Rian Johnson's next film ""The Brothers Bloom"" is due out early next year & has Nora Zehetner who played Laura & Noah Segum who played Dode.  Johnson's screenplay won awards from Central Ohio Film Critics Association and San Francisco Film Critics Circle.  Johnson was nominated as a promising director by the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and by the Sitges-Catalonian International Film Festival.  The film won a special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

Joseph Gordon Levitt was excellent in both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stop-Loss/dp/B0013FSL1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stop-Loss</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mysterious-Skin-Deluxe-Unrated-Director-s-Edition/dp/B000F6II1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)</a>.  For those of us who laughed hard at TV's ""Third Rock from the Sun,"" it's wonderful to see his growth as an actor, perhaps poised to become a major star with the right film.  As Brendan, he carried his love on his sleeve as he seeks to find out the truth behind his girlfriend's murder.  He is unable to turn off his feelings or abandon his search, despite the fact that she broke up with him & apparently did not love him.

Norh Zehetner plays Laura, a wealthy high school student, invited to the right parties.  She goes with a football star to enhance her status.  She is more than two-faced.  As Rian Johnson creates the role, we are always interested to see what face will next emerge.

Lukas Haas plays the Pin, a small-time drug dealer with his own student criminal organization.  The guy's looks are so odd with a cane and crazy hairstyle, that Haas' very minimal controlled acting style seems almost at odds with the dialogue.  It is a very interesting performance and treatment of the character.

Noah Fleiss turns in an excellent performance as Tugger.  He becomes more prominent as the film unravels.  His hair-trigger temper explodes repeatedly at a moment's provocation.  Fleiss seems to perfect this repeated assault.

Matt O'Leary who was in a film I didn't happen to care for titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frailty/dp/B00006AUJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frailty</a>&nbsp;plays the Brain.  His character supports Brendan as his backup and support.  One of the flaws I found with the script was the lack of integration of the Brain to the plot.  I had no idea why he and Brendan were so cooperative.  The final scene on the football field made the relationship even more nebulous.  I found myself wondering if the film would have been tighter had his character been written out.  That said, O'Leary certainly seemed every part the brainy nerd masking a whole other world of experience.

Emile de Ravin played Tess on a favorite TV show of mine, ""Roswell.""  She has also played Claire Littleton on TV's ""Lost.""  I found the plastic blue bracelets that hang limp in the water on the DVD front cover to echo a cheapness to which her character Emily aspires.  De Ravin brings complexity to the role's limited screen time.

Noah Segun plays the dimwitted, thick-headed boyfriend of Emily.  I found it interesting to watch his screentest in the DVD extras, very minimal acting, but well in character throughout.  As Dode, Segun brings a childlike charm to a goth exterior.  He looked better in the screentest, which is probably Johnson's point.

Richard Roundtree plays Assistant Vice Principal Trueman in a great cameo.  His banter with Brendan is as bouncy as ping-pong match.  Meagan Good has nice moments as Kara, a stage chanteuse who enjoys Asian makeup.

In the beginning of the film, I found the fast-paced language incomprehensible much of the time.  I kept asking myself, ""What'd they say?""  Even when I rewound to get what they said, I still had no clue what it meant.  As the film unwinds, we acclimate to a hip lingo that is often a cool shorthand that provides the missing pieces of the puzzle.  I liked the very practical commentary by Rian Johnson in the DVD extras.  For example, he talks about having to re-shoot the final football field scene with Brendan and Laura, but having to shoot their faces from the ground up to mask the changes that had been made to green the football field.  I enjoyed the film, appreciating how Johnson gives free reign to his supporting characters to shine.  This is worth an evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!",1229040000,3,4570,5.382228490832158

2570614,4,B000FKP4BU,"In up and coming director Rian Johnson's film Brick, audiences are treated to a truly unique and memorable mystery film. Inspired by the literary work of the great detective novel writer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dashiell-Hammett/dp/1883011671/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dashiell Hammett</a>, who is best known as the creator of Sam Spade and The Thin Man, Rian Johnson set out to create a hip, contemporary noir film. While simultaneously following in the footsteps of great mystery writers like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Johnson succeeds in revitalizing the detective genre for a new generation, and he does so by making a drastic departure from the traditions of typical film noir. Rather than setting his story in a decaying metropolis full of smoky rooftops and shadowy alleyways, Johnson places the story and its characters in the suburbs of modern day Southern California. He transforms the hard-bitten stereotyped figures of pulp novels into world-weary teenagers and he updates the all-too-familiar dialogue of detective films, turning it into something more improvisational and poetic, almost as though the film's dialogue was part of a jazz song. Though the highly stylized dialogue limits the commercial accessibility of the film, it is arguably what gives the story its refreshing flavor. Using a combination of 1940s slang and modern pop terminologies, Johnson dislocates viewers from reality and relocates them in a ""shadow world"", where every darkness hides behind it a secret and every soul is haunted by their misdeeds. Yet somehow the film avoids pretension and self-importance, which is truly remarkable in itself.

When Brendan, an anti-social and extremely street savvy high school senior, receives a distressed phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Emily, who cryptically asks him to help her, he doesn't know what to do. They had broken up a few short months earlier when Emily began hanging with the wrong crowd; the rich, the snotty, the over privileged and then the low-level drug dealers and a host of other less than savory peers. Brendan had tried to protect her from their corrupting influence, from their world of drugs, sex, and violence, but his efforts failed and Emily left him for a drug dealer named Dode. Now Brendan sees his chance to help her, to save her from self-destruction if it isn't already too late... but it is. Learning that Emily was meant to meet someone for a late night meeting in a tunnel, Brendan shows up hoping to talk to her. Instead he finds her dead body. After hiding her body, Brendan begins to set into action a plan to find those responsible for Emily's ""downfall"". Naturally Brendan, being somewhat of a lone wolf, doesn't have direct access to the same cliques that Emily did. He goes to his brilliantly resourceful friend, Brain, who seems to have the dirt on just about everyone in school. With Brain's help, Brendan infiltrates a world of drug dealers, of adolescent femme fatales, of snitches and sneaks, and of conspiracies. Soon the trail leads him to a local urban legend regarding a drug dealer known as The Pin (short for The Kingpin), who lives in his parents' basement. When Brendan finally makes his way into The Pin's circle and meets his ""hothead"" bodyguard Tug, and his slinky and seductive gal pal Laura, he has no clue of the level of danger and deception that surrounds him. As the intrigue is elevated so too are Brendan's troubles. It doesn't take him long to figure out that ""there's not much chance of coming out clean.""

It should be pretty obvious that Brick is in no way an attempt to portray high school realistically. Rian Johnson has, in fact, succeeded in making high school even more oppressive and agonizing. Who knew that was even possible?
Another great strength of the film is its use of atmospheric and highly evocative music. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/beautifully-haunting-score/dp/B000EDWLHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">beautifully haunting score</a>&nbsp;was created by Rian Johnson's cousin, Nathan Johnson, who heightens the story's emotional subtext and the dramatic tension in a devastating manner.
The film features a talented young cast including Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan, Lukas Haas as The Pin, Noah Fleiss as Tug, Norah Zehetner as Laura, Matt O'Leary as Brain, Noah Segan as Dode, and Emilie de Ravin as Emily. The cast also features Meagan Good, and in a cameo role, Richard Roundtree of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>&nbsp;fame.

And I'd like to address the reviewer who said this is another film where the kids don't appear to have parents and he couldn't believe that high school kids were running a complicated drug operation. This is the way a startling percentage of the population of this country grows up. Alot of parents are too busy working to pay attention to their children and teenagers are not as dumb as most people think.

It reminded me a bit of River's Edge, another film that pulls you into its web.  At times you sorta feel like you're watching, Fight Club, or Guy Richie film, but then it comes back to the characters and that is what makes this film different.  Lukas Haas is prefectly cast, and when he sort of pops up, it's like, finally somebody is using this talent young character actor, I really don't understand how, Shia LaBouef gets so much work and somebody like Haas, is rarely seen, but I digress, anyway, Haas really sets the pace for the latter half of the film.  Without getting into the specifics of the film, (FYI, I loathe when reviewers practically recite the screenplay word for word) I will say that it is story of a loner, Gordon-Levitt, his love for a girl that is unrequinted, the mystery surrounding her, and Gordon-Levitts pursuit of the truth, through a maze of blowback.

The same can be said of grumbling about the convuluted plot and slangy dialog (that's the nature of the genre). I do think, however, that the muddy sound of the dialog is a problem. You end up missing some great lines (and you shouldn't need subtitles).

The utter brilliance of this film makes it difficult to even write about it, and every time I watch it I'm more intrigued with the characters. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really carries the film with his character Brenden's fearless quick-wit and carefully crafted lines. The whole cast, however, works together so well and the chemistry is as such that the exchange is so quick you really have to pay attention to catch all the wit. Johnson created this tale in the tradition of classic hard boiled detective stories the likes of The Maltese Falcon (even quoting this film), but placing the events in a suburban Southern Californian high school, giving this a unique modern edge.

2570635,3,B000FKP4BU,"I ended up with this film believing it to be a hard boiled Noir style film similar to Bound.

In the beginning of the movie Brendan isn't even sure there is a ""The Pin"" and doesn't know what a ""Tug"" is.  The suspense element of the ""not knowing"" about them is lost as the cover of the DVD clearly shows that ""The Pin"" and ""Tug"" exist and who they are.

Other issues I had with the movie are that at the end it is assumed the audience, me, picked up on stuff that wasn't even shown during the movie, like how the girl died, what ailment Brendan has and/or how he got it.  Also based on the context it seems that the code names for certain groups changes through the movie.  At one point ""The Bulls"" is obviously one group, but at the end of the movie is used as a reference for a completely different group. huh?

Some of you may have come here because you tried to watch it but had to turn it off because you couldn't understand what the hell they were talking about.

Let me suggest this: TURN ON THE SUBTITLES.

Yeah, I know it's in English and you recognize the main character from that TV show: Third Rock from The Sun, but this isn't a sitcom on NBC, and this isn't your typical run-of-the-mill, teen flavored High School drama.

Seeing 1940's film noir, soaked in a teen centered tale of woe, works better than I would've ever thought. And for the record, I don't think anyone, other than the writer dared attempt something like this and succeed at it too. Bravo.

Rian Johnson makes a writing and directorial debut to rival most of his peers and mentors. This film is enough to make the Gods tremble, hopefully he'll be able to follow it up appropriately. On a side note, Rian offers up his screenplay, the novella he wrote that goes with it, an essay and drawings for no charge on his site, which is easily found, if you're interested in reading.

Nora Zehetner as the smoldering and cold-calculating heroine is also a definite high point, and her career and longevity in films is assured.

2570638,4,B000FKP4BU,"Dubious of PK's choice of movie, I was surprised when Brick turned out to be one the best movies I've seen this year. Which, I guess, I should have known. As a fan of independent films, ones that are story and character driven, they are usually thousands of times better than half the films the major studios produce, even the ones they save for Oscar season.

This debut film from writer and director by Rian Johnson, is a stylized and clever film noir, where the teenaged cast speak in the jargon of the classic black & white films of the 1940's.

Levitt-Gordon plays Brendan, a teen who is an outsider who wants to be just that, with his floppy hair and round glasses, that makes him look like a cross between Harry Potter and Jared Padalecki from TV's Supernatural. When his ex-girl friend contacts him unexpectedly, sobbing about how she's screwed up every thing, and then disappears he becomes consumed with finding her.

But to do it, he must submerge himself within the dangerous drug culture of southern California. He contacts The Brain, his one and only peer, who can get him information on socialite girls, a dangerous thug named Tugger, a girl named Kara and school's quarterback Brad. In doing so, Brendan also comes into orbit of The Pin, a drug kingpin of the area.

And when Lukas Haas turns up late in the film, as the baroque Pin (looking much like Jonathan Frid from Dark Shadows fame) he steals the film.

At first, I found the florid dialogue a bit distracting, it reminded me of the updated Romeo and Juliet from a few years ago - set in present day, but using the Shakespearean talk. But after a while, the story sucked you in, along with Gordon-Levitt's and Haas performances.

2570640,4,B000FKP4BU,"I had seen a preview or two of this movie and was interested immediately, but it was only when I saw this movie listed somewhere as one of the top 20 high school movies of all time, in the same category as such classic as Heathers and Ferris Beuller, that I was now fully intrigued.  What makes a film about high school a classic for me is when it studies the absurdity of high school, the social circles that are designed more to torture individuals than promote them.  And this is someone who was not just ostracized in high school, but has also come back to teach in it.

And to boot, this film also has the edge of making the world of this high school the setting of film noir.

The main story has to do with Brendan, an outsider who eats lunch behind the school building nowadays, who gets a note of desperation from her old flame, Emily.  Emily is in trouble, but she can't say exactly what trouble she is in, which leads Brendan on a search through the culture of his school.  With an informant named Brain, a classic geek who even works on a Rubrics Cube, Brendan delves into the world of the jocks, the beautiful people, and the burn-outs to work a plan that will have all involved exposing themselves to his limelights.  There is, of course, a beautiful but possibly treacherous femme fatale, a Tolkein-reading drug dealer along with his fists-for-brains muscle, and a vice principal who sounds more like a police seargant in a crooked town than a suit with a degree.

But this film doesn't just work on the level of film noir appreciation.  The social hell that is high school seems a fitting setting for this homage, so the technique seems quite fitting.  The dialogue is wonderful to listen to, though it gets a little troublesome when it is being used to advance the plot, for the delivery is quick (as it is supposed to be, but still sometimes hard to follow) and the names almost too numerous to keep an even handle on.  A bit of a score card is needed to keep track of some things, but a lot of this works out in fascinating ways, the plots within plots within plots led on by this tough plain-T-shirt wearing smart mouth who can throw a punch when he has to but also gets beat up about as much as Gabriel Byrne's character in Miller's Crossing.

Not the top 5 in the realm of high school film, but definitely within the top 20.  Well worth a watch.",1189900800,5,2366,4.3744292237442925
2570641,5,B000FKP4BU,"I guess I disagree with all of the people who wrote bad reviews. Yes, some parts of the movie are not quite realistic. It's a movie!! Movie does not equal reality. I think it provides a good look into the underworld that exists in many middle class American high schools. So if you grew up sheltered from the drug world in your high school it may be difficult to relate. However if you grew up in a high school with drug prevalence it will really resonate with you.

The movie deals heavily with drugs and their presence in American high schools. I felt that I could really relate to the movie. A guy in my high school got a bullet in the head when he didn't come up the money from a brick of coke that was fronted to him. Another guy got a gunshot wound to the leg when he knew too much about something with the message that the next one would be in his head. Four guys beat a guy to death for his wallet. I'm sorry if the movie and the plot seems unrealistic to some, perhaps if you hadn't led such a sheltered life it would seem more real to you.

The fact that the characters seem a bit too intelligent is again a product of perception. My high school group of friend's was very Dawson's Creek, our conversations seemed to be beyond our years.

2570643,4,B000FKP4BU,"Far-fetched as this may sound, ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" kept popping into my head when I saw ""Brick"". Think about it: both share the same basic conceptual premise, i.e. the improbable crossing of very specific film genres with a high school universe, both have larger-than-life, charismatic and virtually unstoppable protagonists, and both are propelled by fast, sharp, intelligent dialogue. They also raise similar problems concerning suspension of disbelief, of course, but Rian Johnson and Buffy's creator Joss Whedon deal with those very differently.

In ""Buffy"" the conflict between the supernatural and the prosaic not only isn't disguised in any way but actually highlighted for humoristic purposes, and self-deconstruction is even a trademark of the series. Not so with Johnson's work. Although obviously conscious of the film's lack of ""realism"" the director never lets his guard down, and these extremely articulate, focused, serious and animally elegant teenagers remain strangely believable throughout. There are a couple of buffyesque moments, like when the mysterious villain's mom prepares a  nice snack for the boys and the ""noir mood"" just switches off for a few seconds, but the film simply returns intact to its previous intensity.

""Brick"" has a definite dreamlike quality to it. Incongruous and unbelievable as most dreams, the film has the same ability to hold the viewer's attention regardless. In fact, one could even see ""Brick"" as an intricate, vivid dream by a Raymond Chandler loving, high school misfit who's just lost his girlfriend and is unconsciously dealing with it in his sleep. The almost complete absence of teachers, parents or any other grownups would be just a reflection of how he sees the world. And, returning to ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", weren't the vampires and monsters that she fought simply metaphors for her growing pains?",1185148800,6,1877,5.377551020408164

But what a clever, fascinating ruse he's devised--the plot itself is a mind twister worthy of ""Kiss Me Deadly."" And the acting, like the dialogue, is utterly sincere, even at its most outrageously hip.

2570648,5,B000FKP4BU,"Thinking about high school, it's odd that no ""high school noir"" films existed prior to the last few years.  High school is such a perfect setting for a film noir, and though it may seem ridiculous at first, there's many parallels between the world of a teenager and a character in a 1940s noir, be it the battle between the police and the shamuses and the battle between the administrators and the students or the shady meetings under bridges and the shady meetings in the parking lot after school.  In 2004, Rob Thomas' Chandler-esque take on high school hit UPN (and later the CW) as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veronica-Mars/dp/B000A59PMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veronica Mars</a>,"" and one year later, ""Brick"" premiered at Sundance.

While ""Veronica Mars"" is on the lighter side of noir, ""Brick"" is a pitch black, gritty piece which recalls Howard Hawks' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Sleep/dp/B000FFJYA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Sleep</a>,"" with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  The resemblance isn't in the style of director Rian Johnson (which bears a striking similarity to that used by David Lynch in one of his own neo-noir's, 1992's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks-Fire-Walk-with-Me/dp/B000056BP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</a>""), but in the convoluted script, the conspicuous characters, and particularly the rapidfire, hard-boiled dialogue, delivered at a startling pace by a talented young cast.  This includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, best known as the youngest alien explorer from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3rd-Rock-from-the-Sun/dp/B0007WQGVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3rd Rock from the Sun</a>,"" along with Emilie de Ravin of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>,"" Lukas Haas, Noah Fleiss, and Richard Roundtree, the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>.""  Gordon-Levitt's role is a far cry from his work on ""Third Rock.""  He's cool, quick-witted, and tough, something of a much more contemptuous Sam Spade.  Gordon-Levitt is truly excellent, and he shows real promise should he be cast in the right roles.  Haas and Fleiss both play their roles quite well, but it's Meagan Good as a scheming drama queen (literally) who commands the most attention.

The film's plot, even at its barest, is quite clearly shaped in the noir mold: Gordon-Levitt's character, a high school student who keeps himself distanced from his classmates, thrusts himself into the cliques in an effort to find out who murdered his ex-girlfriend.  His search leads him to the Pin (Haas), a 26-year-old drug kingpin.  In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Gordon-Levitt meets with the Pin and his henchman in the kitchen, while the Pin's mother serves them breakfast and apple juice before kissing him goodbye.  It's the one scene in ""Brick"" where writer/director Johnson acknowledges that all our characters are kids, and that the film itself revolves around high school, despite its utterly somber tone.

The rest of the movie is so relentlessly straight-faced and serious that you almost forget it's a film noir about high school.  It's classic noir, though.  The protagonist loner with a rocky exterior and a noble interior, looking to do the right thing; the suspicious, all-powerful, ominous villain, usually an obsese fifty-year-old businessman but in this case a twenty-something drug dealer living in his basement; the femme fatale, a beautiful seductress with a hidden agenda; even the flirtatious and manipulative female who usually is an actress or waitress or secretary, or something along those lines, but who here is the lead actress in the high school drama club.  Much of the film's charm comes from consideration of its many allegories to ""adult"" noir tales.

The execution of this sort of idea matters so much, because, after all, what is a film noir if not cinema at its most stylish?  Johnson is well aware of this, though.  It shows not only in the maturity and seasoned approach of his directing, but also in the stimulating photography and, especially, in the stunning editing.  It comes as no surprise that the editing, also by Johnson, is so good, since Johnson began his career editing his short film ""Evil Demon Goofball from Hell!!!"" and then Lucky McKee's popular ""May.""  ""Brick"" would make an excellent sample film to show young editors, since Johnson - at 29, a young editor himself - has done such a spectacular job, fashioning a seamless flow of jump cuts, point-of-view shots, distorted lenses, and exposed film.  Supporting this is an inventive, unorthodox score by Nathan Johnson, comprised of some sort of naiive bells and the woeful trumpet which Jerry Goldsmith used in his music for ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential.""

It's a pity that ""Brick"" didn't get more notice.  It was unquestionably one of the best films of 2005.  I'd even go so far as to call it one of the top films I've ever seen.  Viewed as a film from an experienced director, it's a stellar film, but when viewed as Johnson's debut, it's a fantastic achievement.  Fortunately, Johnson seems to have received the attention he deserved from this film: his next project stars big-name actors like Rachel Weisz and Adrien Brody.  I really hope Gordon-Levitt gets some decent roles, because he proves his acting prowess here.  It's films with the originality and effort of ""Brick"" that keep the industry going, and if you haven't seen it, don't hesitate to leap up and hunt for it like Sam Spade for the maltese falcon.",1182556800,2,5835,5.7354988399071924
2570649,4,B000FKP4BU,"Imagine a really complicated murder mystery of 1940s-ish noir like ""The Maltese Falcon"" set in modern American high school, and you will get ""Brick,"" first-time director Rian Johnson's experimental, but entertaining crime drama. Brendan, hard-boiled-type, Bogart-like high school student, is determined to find out the truths behind the death of his former girl-friend, and with a help from bespectacled buddy (Matt O'Leary), he confronts the thugs with knife and gun, and a grinning drug lord (Lucas Haas) while fending off the threat from the authorities ... not the police, but the vice-principal of the school.

This detective-story-in-high-school premise could have been a very bad joke with another director, but in fact the results are much better than you expect with strong acting of the cast, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt as hard-nosed Brendan, and sure-handed direction from Rian Johnson. It takes a while to get accustomed to the rhythm and mood of the film, and lots of slang too, but once you do, you find the film surprisingly engaging with the story of complicated mystery among a web of these eccentric characters.

Still I was a little disappointed with the film's female characters. There is no chemistry or sexual tension between Brendan and other female characters, especially with Laura played by Nora Zehetner in Chinese dress, and beautiful as she is, she is no Mary Astor. This kind of story needs a femme fatale, but how can you find a Barbara Stanwyck wearing an anklet in today's high school?

If you're looking for something really different, ""Brick"" is for you.  Rian Johnson wrote and directed ""Brick"" as an homage to the film noir style of the forties.  To call the characters and dialogue ""hard-boiled"" would be an understatement. They are all jaded and calloused and see little or no value in life.  They speak in a teen/drug code that is so unique I actually had to turn on the subtitles to understand it.  That didn't detract from the movie, however.  Once I figured out what the slang meant, it was a fascinating new language.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt has matured a lot since he was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3rd-Rock-From-the-Sun/dp/B000NQJPW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3rd Rock From the Sun</a>.  He carries the movie with his James Dean-charisma and brooding charm.  Lukas Haas gives a subtle, eerie performance as a club-footed drug lord.  There is only one adult in the movie, making the teens seem even more alone and alienated from mainstream society.  This is a moody, intense, and unflinching look at the teen drug world (and it's interesting that there are no curse words, no drugs are mentioned by name, and no drugs are taken on camera.)

Yes, there is action and violence, but the movie has a very intricate dialouge to follow, many words. At times i felt they were reading out of a book.  And the little slams and quirky language that they use, I just don't envision people naturally just being able to play off each other so spontaniously with insults etc, giving this movie and almost short story feel to it.

2570655,5,B000FKP4BU,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in ""Brick"" as Brendan, a high school student searching for his ex-girlfriend, Emily.  After they broke up, Emily started ""eating lunch"" with a more popular, yet mysterious crowd (""The Upper-Crust"").  As he delves into their world, he finds a sickening subculture of drugs, double-crosses, and worse.

The movie is set in Orange County (San Clemente), and the movie's big hook is that it's an update of those terrific film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.  Yes, the movie sometimes comes across as ""The O.C."" mixed with ""The Lady from Shanghai,"" with just a touch of ""Blue Velvet.""  However, as such, ""Brick"" succeeds very well.  The dialogue is full of clever pithy lines and slang that went out with Eisenhower (Beautiful woman: Do you trust me now?  Brendan: Less than when I didn't trust you before.).  The directing is also terrific - kudos to first time director Rian Johnson.  Finally, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt makes a likeable protagonist amidst the crazy proceedings and characters, including a rather magnetic Lukas Haas as ""The Pin.""

Although making the film in noir style is essentially a stunt, the tone helps make the movie deeper, more satisfying - easily one of the most intricate teen dramas ever made.  The plot is full of holes (what film noir isn't?), but the noir style and look smoothes out the rough edges; yes, style does sometimes trump content.  There were a few times when the ""Brick"" verged on being a typical teen movie; fortunately, Johnson manages to get back on track.

2570658,4,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a bit surreal, a bit noir, and a bit high school drama. The only reason it's high school drama is because the story is played out with high school kids. What makes the film interesting and gives it its twist, is that the story feels as if it was written for a cast in their thirties.

If Brick had played out with a more age-appropriate cast, though, it would have been more of a cliche whodunit mystery-drama. Instead, it plays out in an interestingly unique way. The audience is asked to accept the situation as reality, while at the same time being presented with the conflicting message of incongruity between the actions and the storyline. Instead of hindering the film, this actually makes it better.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, although arguably miscast as the hardnosed detective type, plays his nonchalant protagonist with so much temperamental angst and passive strength that he almost pulls it off, despite his fragile bookish look. He's still a strong actor and helps carry the film's emotional core.

The story itself sometimes feels a little contrived, but it's at those times that you have to remember that these are high school kids involved in over-the-top noirish detective drama. The school principal substitutes for the tough cop looking for a scapegoat, but willing to make a deal with the detective. The school jock for the loud mouth tough guy who's not really as deep into the game as he'd like people to believe. Each character substitution for the classic detective story is here, and each one is well played.

The film wraps up cleanly and leaves the viewer satisfied. The DVD is lacking in extras, and for some reason they include the audition tape of the female lead, even though she's the weakest of the lot, and her audition tape just goes to prove that she didn't improve much from day one. Brick is definitely worth checking out, though.",1178236800,2,1874,4.8105590062111805
2570659,5,B000FKP4BU,"You know the one. The guy who defends a movie by saying its detractors ""don't get it"" or ""missed the point"". The guy who implies the so-called problem is not the confusing plot, awkward direction, poor acting, etc, but rather the viewer's intelligence. I'm going to try to avoid being ""that guy"" in this review, so here goes...

There is little point in reviewing this film's plot. Amazon.com and tons of reviewers have done just that. This is simply to function as an elaboration of just why ""Brick"" is how it is.

""Brick"" is very much a genre piece. Not only that, it is part of a genre that is no longer particularly popular. Film noirs, in their purest sense, haven't been popular (or regularly made) in decades. ""Brick"", despite its present-day high school setting and teenage characters, is a film noir.

If you haven't seen many film noirs and thus are less comfortable with (or willing to put up with) their conventions, ""Brick"" may not work for you at all. The plot is convoluted, the dialogue is strange and stilted, the characters live in a sparsely-populated, seemingly self-contained world. In most genres these traits would be tsk-worthy. With noirs, which tend to focus more on atmosphere and relish ambiguity, they are accepted and often championed.

""Brick"" is not going to be for everyone--what film is? If you go into this film expecting something modern or realistic, you will likely be disappointed. If you have a open mind, or at least realize what you're getting in to, you will discover a creative spin on a stagnant genre, some excellent performances (particularly Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and one of the best films in recent years.",1178150400,2,1655,4.858156028368795
2570660,4,B000FKP4BU,"I don't mean ""funny - ha ha.""  Just ""funny.""  I read great reviews about this film so I took it out from the library.  I was immediately drawn into it, mostly by the presence of the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a very appealing young actor.  As I watched it all I could think of was how times had changed since I went to high school...!  Yeah, everyone knows kids do drugs now but the extremity of the plot and the violence...Well, I know it was Los Angeles, but still...

Call me Gramma Moses or something but it defied reality for me.  I know kids (excuse me for using this term, but they are supposed to be high school age so I don't know what else to call them) are smart these days but this smart?  Gee, who writes their dialog?

I agree with others that the lead is miscast.  Charming and cute as he is, he didn't seem street-smart and tough as I guess he was supposed to be.  He seemed like a bookish, serious type who is never too far away from his glasses.  (It's amazing that his glasses survived through all of the physical abuse he took.)  It was just not believable to me that such a sweet, physically frail looking guy would put himself in such horrendous danger over and over.  I kept wondering where his parents were?  Did he have any?  He really looked like a nice boy from a nice home who would probably be going to an Ivy League school the next year.

Ok, so it wasn't supposed to be realistic but it was shot in a realistic way and that's what made it not really work for me.  It wasn't ""noir"" in the sense of the classic noir films. It is shot in sunny southern California, in brilliant color.  In classic noir films the people are hard nosed middle aged types, not fresh faced innocents like most of these kids.  (The hero doesn't even smoke!)

I did turn the subtitles on and it helped.  Mostly I could follow the plot but sometimes the names were too confusing....the Pin, Tug, Dode, etc.  Some of the dialogue, even with the subtitles, was completely incomprehensible.  The charm of Gordon-Levitt did keep me caring, through all of the plot twists and carnage.  But, ten minutes after the film was over, I stopped caring...make that five minutes.

I give it four stars because, well I guess I was impressed by it, but then I'm probably too easily impressed. Anyway the acting is very good.",1177632000,2,2313,4.383529411764706

So what if the world was mostly inhabitated by teens in this film?  It did not flaw my enjoyment of this film.  While the film was obviously influenced by class Film Noir genre movies, Cache, Veronica Mars, and, yes, many mafia films, Brick is clearly an original piece, which is a great change from all of these ""Bread and Circus"" films that are plaguing mainstream cinemas as we speak.

I liked a lot Joseph Gordon-Levitt (after ""Mysterious Skin"" I promised myself to watch his new movies - he is very talented) as a loner private eye with a broken heart who set to find out the circumstances of his ex-girlfriend's murder. Grown-up Lucas Haas stars as a powerful drug lord who still lives with his mom. I had to watch the movie with the subtitles on - I had no idea what was told quite often.

2570663,4,B000FKP4BU,"To all you casual movie fans out there, you shouldn't pay any mind into the film geeks who take so much time showing you their fancy vocabulary.  After all, a good review is one that simulataneously speaks your impressions and tries to be useful to others. As such I will say that this film will not be appealing to a number of people for a few reasons

1)Many feel that film noir is out-dated and should be put out to pasture for good.

2)There are people out there who absoltely love film noir of the past and completely reject the modern versions of them

3)The characters and coventions of film noirs are meant to walk the line of unrealistic stereotypes and still hold out the intention that this story could happen to anyone.

4)The fact this involves primarily high schoolers will turn off the hard core fans, confuse casual filmgoers, and live on as a maligned attempt at a new school noir.

To those who can get past any those will have a film that plays with the conventions it's handed and comes out pretty good, even though the ending isn't as detective-worthy as you'd think. Yes, Brandon is a convention of the story, but so is everyone in the story we call life. Does he have realistic qualities to his character and is what happens to him possible for others as well? Yes.  The movie, like all noirs, plays it tough and doesn't really give you a lot of character development, the only real glimpse into why Brandon is what he is is shown in the film as a flashback.  As a character says to him ""you're thick"" meaning that he's got an internal temper that won't allow him to give things up easily and that's the key to the story of his character.  I find the story realistic, high schools are battle grounds where violence can and does take place, both in the limelight and out. Do kids deal drugs? Are you kidding? For those who can't suspend their disbelief, it just goes to show you that the film presents a fiction and reality that some people just can't take. The film isn't a masterpiece, but for breaking some ground in the noir genre, it more than makes up for its deficiencies. It's funny, cleverly plays around the conventions and contains textbook noir performances which are more reliant on wordplay than expression, although a little more expression would be nice.

You at least gotta give `em points for trying.

That's about the best that can be said for the people who made ""Brick,"" an ambitious, though ultimately misguided, attempt to set a film noir drama on a contemporary high school campus.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt - who, in ""Mysterious Skin,"" delivered one of the best film performances of 2005 - is here completely miscast as a tough-talking teen investigating the  death of his beloved ex-girlfriend, most likely at the hands of some local drug dealers.  In all fairness to Gordon-Levitt, however, it should be pointed out that in ""Skin,"" he was called upon to play a real life person with real life feelings and emotions, which he did to perfection.  In ""Brick,"" the character is anything BUT real; rather, he is a deliberately artificial construct designed by writer/director Rian Johnson to move the plot along and to enhance the film noir atmosphere.  Yet, there is something inherently ludicrous in having modern teens speaking in the clipped phrasing and arch wordiness typical of 1940's film noir characters.  Actors like Bogart, Lancaster and Widmark didn't just have their tough-guy status conferred on them; they had to earn it, through the kind of wisdom and gravitas that come only with age and a life composed largely of hard knocks, both physical and psychological.  We always understood that it was the baggage they brought with them from their previous lives that made them what they were today.  Lacking this life experience, the characters in ""Brick,"" on the other hand, go through the motions, but always eliciting the nagging impression in us that they are merely playing dress-up (if not literally, at least metaphorically), a fact which drains the film itself of vitality and relevance.  To put it more bluntly and succinctly, we simply don't care.

It doesn't help that the story itself is convoluted and not particularly compelling, or that the acting is stiff and deliberately one-note in nature (not the fault of the actors, I must add).  Moreover, it's rather inexplicable as to why this high school seems strangely bereft of teachers and classrooms.  On the positive side, Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin do bring an appropriately stark and ominous look to the normally cheery, antiseptic Southern California suburban backdrop against which the drama takes place.

Perhaps by the time they all get together for their 20th high school reunion, the characters will have grown into their roles.  Till then, I'll stick with film noir dramas that are by, about and for grownups.",1174867200,10,2561,5.076372315035799
2570665,4,B000FKP4BU,"I can understand why reviews of this movie are so split down the middle.  It's a very strange and weird idea: Shoot a film noir and do the dialogue and structure as if you were adapting a Hammett novel back in the day, but set and shoot the movie at a contemporary California high school.  Either you think this is brilliant or you think it's totally idiotic.

From my own experience and from talking to others, I think it is tough to get into this movie primarily because of the patterns of speech. Everybody talks very fast with a stylized delivery as if they were in a movie from the 30s or 40s, using a lot of slang most of us don't use, and the sound quality isn't so great. My suggestion to anyone who wants to give this a go but winds up having a hard time is to try it out with SUBTITLES, believe it or not (and I am *not* kidding about this). Because once I did, I realized I was mishearing certain words and I started to pick up on the rhythms, hear things correctly, and the dialogue started to sound natural; eventually I got into the flow of it enough to get rid of them (though I admit in a few scenes I wound up going back and putting them back on just to make sure I got the lines right).

You might ask, what's the point of doing a movie this way if it winds up creating a problem like that?  Well, I think that the reason for dealing with this is because this oddball strategy of Rian Johnson's winds up actually creating one of the more successful attempts at a contemporary film noir. For whatever strange reason, the artificiality of the dialogue and farcical nature of the proceedings works quite well once you give in to the conceit. Many other attempts at doing a modern neo-noir wind up feeling way too ""retro"" and nostalgic and they stumble over themselves trying to figure out how to be modern but yet try to keep all the elements of old detective thrillers that people miss and want to see (see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for an example of sort of the tricky questions that come up in trying to do contemporary noir). The high school setting actually defuses that problem because it is silly and anachronistic already, so having modern day kids talking in old fashioned out of date tough guy lingo is no more strange than having anyone else, adult or not, talking that way these days. The plot is predictably convoluted in the old noir-detective style and there are all the usual archetypes and manipulations. Somehow they seem sort of fresh in the setting of high school. And since most of us tended to discover detective novels in our teen years, it seems perfectly fitting to project their tropes out into that world, to imagine that high school is a microcosm of all the things one read about in pulp fiction.

I had always meant to pick it up but just ended up walking by it in blockbuster. I eventually decided to rent it and see what all the fuss was about. I had seen the preview and was quite intrigued, this looked fresh and unique!

Sadly, this film tried way too hard to be all the things my friend said it was. I feel that the only people who will really enjoy this movie are ""indie"" high school kids who think very highly of their intellect. When this movie started, all I could say to myself was ""Are these high school kids??? Does this take place in high school....? I mean, they have lockers so it must...."" Some reviewers have said that the dialogue of these kids was ""edgey"" in a word. You could barely understand the characters. I'm sorry, but when people sit down to watch a movie they don't want to have to pause it every 5 minutes to process what the characters just said. Because of the contrived and overly ambitious lingo of this film, its very hard to understand whats even going on half the time. I'm still not even really sure what the point of the whole story was at the end.

I'm giving it three stars because the acting was fabulous and the cinematography and camera work was probably what made me keep watching. But overall, this is a very pretentious peice of work. Its just trying to be something that it isn't...and it fails. It crashes and burns when it comes to being a noir detective thriller. The average American audience would not even be able to follow the story.

To me the dialog is trying to be WAY smarter than it is.  Which to me is the most frustrating about this movie.  This might be how Shakespeare would write dialog if he was a modern day 17 year old douchebag.  The dialog just confuses an already complex mystery of who is allied with who and what each character's true motives are.  I see a review that says the dialog is ""hard-boiled lingo that's both comic and poetic"", no it is just contrived and boring.

While the some of the actors really suprised me with their great performances. The characters in this film don't ever get the depth and backstory each deserves and for this I think the movie suffers.  To me the thin characters make me think this was maybe written by someone in high school.

These kids at this age don't have that much of an organized mind to plan out such an elaborate scenario. The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars was for the acting which was very good.

2570678,4,B000FKP4BU,"Brick (Rian Johnson, 2005)

Brick was listed at moviefone as one of the fifty best movies of 2006-- in fact, it sits on that list at number ten. Interestingly, just about every other review of the movie I've read was more hesitant in its praise, as if no one could believe that young filmmaker Rian Johnson and Third Rock from the Sun cutie Joseph Gordon-Levitt could take this admittedly ludicrous idea-- set a noir film straight out of the forties, archaic dialogue and all, in a modern suburban high school-- and pull it off. The evidence, however, can now be seen on DVD, and Johnson pulls it off tremendously.

Gordon-Levitt's last two roles have been the kinds of things that kill careers in Hollywood on a regular basis-- first as a gay hustler in Gregg Araki's strong adaptation of Scott Heim's Mysterious Skin, and now as a guy who does the shuffle-and-mumble better than anyone since Crispin Glover in Wild at Heart. Gordon-Levitt here plays Brendan, a kid who, in the opening scene, is crouched in a culvert, staring at a body who may or may not be dead. We quickly learn that said body is that of his girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend, neither he nor we are ever truly sure) Emily (Emilie de Ravin of Lost); that she is, in fact, quite dead; and that Brendan is determined to find out why for the thoroughly archaic (but oh so noir) reason that, well, she asked him to help her out of a jam. Her new status as a member of the recently-living isn't going to stop him from doing his thing. This leads him to run-ins with psychotic hash addict Dode (Adam and Steve's Noah Segan) and local druglord The Pin (Lukas Haas, recently of the underrated Long Time Dead), the character around whom most of the film's criticism actually seems to center. And rightly, to an extent, for The Pin is a character you're not likely to forget. He's the quirkiest of a quirky bunch, a drug kingpin (hence the nickname) who lives and works in his mother's basement, has a right-hand man who puts one in mind of Marky Mark during his rapping days (The Laramie Project's Noah Fleiss)-- and his presence in the movie, with his style of dress, seems to date the film, which puts the lie to a number of criticisms about realism-- supplant this high school and this plot to the eighties/early nineties, and a lot of seeming anachronisms go away), and has so many affectations that he almost screams ""I'm a parody!"" And yet, somehow, Haas carries the role with an amazing amount of menace. If you can get through the first confrontation between Brendan and The Pin without thinking how unforgivably silly the whole thing is, then you've been well and truly roped in by this movie. Go along for the ride, 'cause it's a good one. ****",1169683200,4,2710,4.574074074074074

The whole movie conjured up images of South Park for me, the absurdity of the situations.

Strangely enough, this confusion kept me watching.  I just couldn't tell if this was supposed to be some dark commentary on being a teenager (if it did it totally sucks), or if it was supposed to be poking fun at the genre of films by casting the characters as high school students (which, if on purpose, was done brilliantly).",1168128000,4,725,4.413533834586466

2570682,5,B000FKP4BU,"I saw a trailer for this on some other DVD and the trailer left me wanting more.  But after that, I heard very little about the movie.  Then, I just happened to see it at Target.  Well, I have thrown away plenty of good money over the years just buying DVDs brand new without watching it beforehand.  So, I went to Hollywood video and picked it up used for about $8.00.  All I can say is that it was one of the best movie purchases I have made in a long time.

I'm no professional reviewer (as you can tell from my other reviews) but this movie grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.  It takes a bunch of high school kids and throws them in an adult situation.  A kid's ex-girlfriend is found dead and he wants to find out whodunit.  That's the movie's premise.  But the path from Point A to Point B is a twisted one full of quick dialogue and beautiful camera shots.  I had to watch it with the subtitles on so I could catch everything that was said.  The way the movie bounces around and has several interesting characters reminds me of a Tarantino movie.  I'm no expert in the film noir genre as the review by Amazon states this movie is, but if this is what the genre holds, I will become a fan.  I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie because other people have done that already, so go read their reviews if that's what you want.  It's a strong film with a hardly-known cast.  Some of them will look familiar to you, but you probably won't remember where you have seen them.  All of the performances are solid and not put aside by a big-named star like other films auffer from.  The movie seems like a cross between Clerks (for its quick dialogue--although not humorous like Clerks--and independent feel), a Tarantino movie (for its unique characters) and L.A. Confidential (for its crime and plot.)  If I haven't bored you to sleep, get in your car, hop the bus or walk to the closest place to find this movie and grab it.",1167955200,4,1946,4.26775956284153

2570684,1,B000FKP4BU,"I had very high hopes for this film.

For months my students had insisted that something was missing in my life: Brick. ""The best movie I've ever seen,"" claimed some. ""Masterpiece"" and similar adjectives peppered their descriptions. So, I caved--and how I wish I hadn't.

Were these young adults dazzled, perhaps, by dozens of uselessly self-indulgent ""art"" shots? Were they sucked (or suckered?) in to the whip-lash currents of overwrought (even for noir) dialogue? I hope not--I would like to give them more credit than that.

No, in the final analysis I can only assume it was an ""age thing."" The film gives teenage life the drama they THINK it had all along--it shows them how they believe themselves to be.

Kids will love this film. In about five years, they will probably be ashamed to admit it--but I'm sure we've all returned to a film after many years and discovered that there was not much there after all. That's what growing up is REALLY all about.

If you're over the age of 18, don't waste your time.

Of course, I realize there are exceptions to every rule: there will be adults out there who love this film. You need not protest that your affection for the film has proven me wrong, since I do not mean to claim that NO adult ANYWHERE can love this film.

Rather, I merely want to warn mature viewers that the overwhelming hype for this film is, in my opinion, based in teenagers' narcissistic love for the imagined dramas of their own lives. In other words, do not see this film because it gets a high rating at Amazon. You will probably be disappointed.

On the other hand, if someone who knows you and your tastes recommends the film, what do I know? I am sure you can rely on their personal expertise.",1166918400,18,1722,4.550161812297735

2570686,1,B000FKP4BU,"If you think ""Key Largo"" is just a place in Florida, if you think ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" seems a phrase in praise of tenacious package carriers, if you think ""Touch of Evil"" is a wrestling move in ""Nacho Libre"" . . . this film is for you. If you recognized these works as milestones in Film Noir, I strongly suggest you avoid this train wreck (you'll feel compelled to return to this page in an effort to ""school"" the plebs who know no better).

Johnson's approach seems innovative to the casual film-viewer: replace mature actors with ""teenagers"" but maintain the overall spirit of the film. Genius! Unfortunately, worldly people realize this as a convention employed to seduce a younger, less discerning audience. Roger Kumble's ""Cruel Intentions"" is a similar modification of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses."" The only difference is that Kumble (also a relatively young director at the time) created a fairly complex work. The lives of these young people were genuinely engaging (no matter the viewer's age). What sparks even further concern are the aforementioned ""teenagers"" in this work. I find it revealing that Johnson would create a work with an adolescent target-demographic, but did not cast teenagers in these roles: Levitt and Zehetner were twenty-five years old during shooting (and, they look their age, which impacts ""suspension of disbelief."") Maybe Johnson should have consulted Gus Van Sant who has confidence in teenage actors: he uses them for both authenticity and to connect with his younger viewers. Still it took Johnson six years to find anyone to fund this product, so his insecurity is somewhat understandable.

What you can expect from the film itself: 1.) While it attempts to emulate the stylized language of the genre, the result is both awkward and embarrassing. The staccato delivery is not as much compelling as it is painfully forced and grotesque. At times it seems as though the actors do not understand their lines, and thus a robotic (not detached, but robotic) effect is evoked. 2.)The cinematography is amateurish. Given that this is Rian Johnson's freshman-project (i.e. his first feature-length film) errors are to be expected but, his simultaneously self-indulgent and sloppy vision is virtually unforgivable. It reads as a graded exercise ... and I'd give Johnson an ""A,"" if he were an underclassman in an introductory class. 3.) The plot is shamefully obvious (a little innovation for this homage would have been welcome). If Johnson tackled even one of these elements with grace, I would have happily granted this film leeway (I mean, he did edit it on a home computer: again, no one wanted to fund this project). But that all three are a pitiful disaster is impossible to overlook.

If you are searching for legitimate, contemporary Film Noir, consider: the Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" Kasdan's ""Body Heat,"" or Black's ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" Leave this vulgar aberration to its inevitable demise in Wal-Mart's clearance bin. Nonetheless, let me defer to the critics . . .

I think the Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert (who found many redeeming qualities in the work) was sage in stating: ""The movie has one inevitable point of vulnerability: Because we can't believe in the characters, we can't care about their fates."" (This is common to many films within the genre though). Nonetheless, the equally as respected Richard Roeper (also Chicago Sun-Times) says it best: ""the gimmick wears thin.""",1166832000,17,3478,5.0964912280701755
2570687,4,B000FKP4BU,"I was very much surprised(in a GOOD way) by this film and only picked up on it after being smitten by the actress who plays Laura(Nora Zehetner), who also happens to be playing one of the special people on NBC's Heroes. When popular critics gave their televised reviews, I was not impressed and only slightly curious.  The mere mention of the kid from Third Rock From the Sun(Gordon-Levitt) and a plot about teens and drugs turned my stomach.  It was only the hint of a story like something from the library of Humphrey Bogart--standing under a lamppost with his tan trenchcoat and fedora while waiting for the dame in the red dress to appear with her side of the story--that made interested.

  But, alas, I did not get to see the film in the theater. Aside from all the artsy ""Noir"" talk--of course this is classified and independent/Sundance film--this movie slipped through my fingers like water on a turtle's back in the summer.  Did that make any sense to you?  Try a whole two hours of chatter like that as fast as you can pronounce the words and understanding all the metaphors. [It helped to put subtitles/captions on and watch the film more than once to catch/comprehend all the lines.] The music is haunting and intoxicating, and the characters are as classical and perfectly cast as they are laughable. The more I watched, the more I was mezmerized. It truly becomes addictive like a drug.

  Brick is reminiscent of such films as Pulp Fiction and just about any of Leonardo DeCaprio's films--particularly his rendition of Romeo and Juliet but with the personalities of a classic black and white detective story(minus the typewriter in the office).  Visually, it appears like a Type A artsy, high school, independent film--and almost locks itself outside the mainstream world.  Had the dialogue been slower and less intelligent for the characters delivering it, the movie might have garnered a wider audience(although the number of reviews for this film here alone shows a rather large underground audience).  Or, I wouldn't have minded if the characters and scenario DID resemble the classic detective films more, like Dick Tracy(Warren Beaty 1990)-style.  Putting a teen peer pressure story together with a Bogart movie seems rather silly, but I will admit to my own amazement.  One of the problems with memory-intensive lines is that you often lose quality of acting/emotion.  And, this film DOES suffer an emptiness of character depth--with the exception of the trampish Kara and the ""pot-skulled reef-worm with more hop in his head than blood,"" Dode.  But, this film has potential.

  The DVD bonuses are few, but you get a few surprises and glimpses into the minds of the director and cast.  You see the amateur skills/mistakes of film making as well as an extended rendition of a curious poem given a sly read by Nora herself--and this piece is also on the CD Soundtrack(there are also a few insightful images of the actress and her audition tape.

  The SOUNDTRACK is a set of 40 pieces mainly composed by the artsy direction of (unknown to me) Nathan Johnson which includes the few potent tracks I really liked. [Emily's theme--aka the main theme--with its haunting cowbells and Laura's theme--aka the smooth detective/seductress lounge music are among the best for both casual parties and background music for other films of this nature.  About half of the CD contains other pieces which sound more like a man experimenting with pots, pans and soda cans in his kitchen and calling it a symphony.] Bonus: Put the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive and get your own downloadable doseable brick(just kidding).

2570689,2,B000FKP4BU,"Brick is a very ambitious attempt at hybrid yet derivitive indy type film making.  Such attempts can yield incredible results as in Slingblade, Pulp Fiction or Blair Witch Project.  Other times the result is a miserable mess.  Unfortunately, Brick is a steaming pile that is more akin to the latter than the former.

Set in the modern day, Brick is essentially a 40's style noir tale juxtaposed to a cast of Southern California highschool street rats.  After having seen the film, my recurring thought was ""Why?""  I suppose I can see how someone might think this story concept could work.  It's a fairly original concept.  I'll give it that.  I'll even allow that the right treatment of Brick very well could have worked to some degree.  Unfortunately, it definitely does not work here.

The major characteristics and archetypes of the noir genre are represented in Brick.  As in many noir films the dialogue is highly stylized and germane only to the universe in which the story takes place.  There is a machine gun cadence to the dialogue delivery that, at times is unintentionally funny.  Unintentional humor is not something filmmakers should shoot for.  It's a good thing people in the real world don't talk the way noir characters do.  If they did no one would understand a thing anyone else was saying.  I appreciate this aspect of the noir genre and have enjoyed it when done well in classic noir films.  But in Brick, it's just too hard to believe that modern day Southern California teens could ever be capable of such dialogue.  It is also hard to swallow the notion that these kids could have lived long enough to become as jaded as is necessary to be authentic noir characters.  As such the entire foundation on which the film rests rings completely false.  These failures totally undermine Brick's character plausibility and represent a fundamental and fatal flaw.  Clearly, the film sounds like a duck, but we know all along that it's not a duck.

The hero of the tale is of course a romantically tortured tough guy loner.  His adversary (aside from the entire world) is a highly intelligent yet amoral and calculating crime boss with a gaggle of lesser minded goons in tow.  There is the obligatory murder victim around which conflict must revolve.  There is a brainy touchstone and ally of the hero who seemingly exists for no other purpose than to do the heroe's grunt work and flesh out details to advance the mostly uninspired plot.  There's even a Macguffin thrown in for good measure, which in this film's case is of course a brick (of heroin).  I am confident when I say that my divulging of these details does not in anyway constitute a spoiler.

The noir genre by definition is hinged upon extreme melodrama, quirky and intense dialogue and extreme machismo.  When depicted with a backdrop of plausible characters the formula can work very well.  But when channeled through modern day teens whom we know are much more likely to be downloading P-Diddy tunes on their MP3 players than playing gumshoes to murder, the whole affair simply collapses under it's own weight.  The director and writer aimed high and should be commended for that.  They just missed this time.",1164585600,6,3191,4.796330275229358

Adolescent ""detective.""  Adolescent chanteuse.  Adolescent femme fatale.  Adolescent gangsters. Adolescent everything.  The gimmick kills the story--kills it dead.  Good writing and good acting can't revive it. I think you have to take teenagers a lot more seriously than I do in order to enjoy this movie. Indeed, you have to take them at least as seriously as they take themselves in this movie (and that's pretty damn seriously).

It would have been much better using adult actors.  Adult stories need adult actors.  I'm not surprised this flick got such poor distribution.",1163980800,9,737,5.275862068965517
2570691,4,B000FKP4BU,"Expertly avoiding the clichs of the well-worn noir genre, Rian Johnson's Brick has one of the most interesting premises in years. By setting his twisty noir tale in a modern day high school, Rian Johnson has breathed fresh life into a style long thought dead. The fact that the setting and style fit together so well ends up being quite a pay off and makes the story that much more intriguing and enjoyable. Every so often there is a line of dialogue that seems a bit contrived for a high schooler to spit out, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt and company usually devlier these lines without any hitches, grounding the film firmly in reality. Gordon-Levitt is excellent as loner hero Brendan Fry and perfectly fits the noir detective archetype; his mannerisms and relentlessly tough-guy attitude seamlessly bridge the gap between the two worlds. Brendan's character calls to mind a number of noir heroes, but perhaps most interestingly is an homage to the protagonist of Miller's Crossing in a series of scenes that hilariously feature Brendan taking beating after beating in very quick succession. While most of the film maintains a slow, deliberate pace familiar to the genre, one scene in particular, in which Brendan is being chased by an unknown thug, is brilliantly directed and delievers a classic ""wow"" moment. The conclusion also features the watermark of its influences as it is fairly easy to predict the who, just not the why. However, this doesn't detract from the quality of the film; it just brings the whole experience to an appropriate close. A wonderful film that succeeds in nearly all respects, Brick is the most enjoyable detective film to come along in years and gives the world a new upcoming writer/director to watch.",1163808000,3,1733,4.958762886597938

Filmed entirely in California it chronicles a series of episodes taking place with a high school setting spawned by drug abuse and violence.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Brendan Frye a fairly together guy with enough street smarts to know the whys and wherefores of the hip upper crust druggie clique.  When he receives a desperate communication from ex-girlfriend Emily played by Emilie de Ravin he is motivated to act.  Still having deep feelings for her, he meets with the strung out looking Emily who tells him to mind his business.  When Emily turns up dead, Levitt recruits the expertise of his buddy ""The Brain"" played by coke bottle bespectacled Matt O'Leary.

If this premise seems ludicrous to you, I can't imagine you'd appreciate this film. However, I thought the change up worked really well. Having your reluctant hero be a jaded, withdrawn teen who eats his lunch behind the school and yearns to solve the mystery of what happened to his ex-lady love completely enthralled me. The twists on the old form are interesting. The vamp being a drama student with a surprisingly posh dressing room. The go-to sidekick being a nerd with access to his mom's cell phone. The muscle being a growling hip hop inspired pot smoker. The movie seethes with a smart energy and the dialogue sizzles.

And even after you watch the first time, and the mystery is solved, Brandon's journey is so intense and swirling that it's great to watch over and over again.

The soundtrack and cinematography complete the package to make a slick movie that is both fun and dark.

My favorite scene is the one that (for me) best encapsulates the film's tone: Brandon gets pulled into the vice principal's office, where he is asked to rat out potential dealers on school property. Brandon says he is no man's stoolie. He did it once, but that was ""to see [the dealer] eaten not to see you [the VP] fed!"" He then shouts that if the VP has a discipline issue with him ""write me up or suspend me!"" This scene so clearly mirrors those scenes where the noir hero is asked to compromise his own investigation that I was tittering throughout.

This film is an original and interesting tale with beautiful camera work and excellent performances. Highly recommended.

One note of warning: Sadly, the packaging of this movie gives away some of the twists and turns in the movie. SO I would recommend not looking too hard at the cover before checking it out.",1163030400,3,1885,4.598214285714286

Please do not let the absence of familiar names and faces deter you from seeing Brick. I thought it was a very clever and entertaining piece of work.

Reading the synopsis provided with the movie (I apologize for not having it available) would tell you to expect an elaborate drug-related plot involving a bunch of high school students. I was drawn to the movie by the trailer from which I had little knowledge of the movie, just an unexplained interest in seeing it. I was hesitant from the synopsis, but it must not have deterred me for too long! What type of ridiculous drug plot could a handful of 16-, 17- and 18-year-old kids actually get into? How far fetched is this story line going to be?

Forget all of that. What the creative team did was take a story that has essentially become clich&eacute; in modern cinema and breathed new life into it. A disinterested, scorned man receives a cry for help from his ex-girlfriend and avails himself of a few liberties not necessarily intended for private citizens under the law only to find the trail to her is long and ultimately leads to a drug king-pin. So far so normal. What was unique to Brick was the high-school setting. You have kids living with their parents trying to uncover conspiracies between classes. Sounds ridiculous, right? Exactly. It is ridiculous. So get over it and enjoy the movie.

The way the teenagers related the drug plot to their pre-adult existence was well done and ultimately made the movie fun to watch.",1162425600,,1723,4.56957928802589

The script was fantastic, and the actors were as well.  I suspect that most of them, who are by and large unknowns, will not be unknowns by this time next year.  ""Brick"" delivers a classic film noir set in a different locale than the hardboiled dramas of mid-century past, without becoming too cutesy or precious about it.

""Brick"" owes more than a little to ""Twin Peaks,"" including the first scene of the movie (which will seem more than a little familiar to TP fans) and its overall atmosphere.  ""Brick"" also tips its hat to ""Blade Runner,"" another film noir reimagined in a different genre, with some Vangelis-ish music near the beginning that will remind you of the Rachel/Deckard scenes in that movie.  Nevertheless, this is a really original movie that will appeal to anyone who likes a good story and a well-made film.

Rian Johnson did good by this one, and it took him almost a decade to get this film made for $500k on 35mm. This film isn't about the cinematography, it's about the story.

2570703,4,B000FKP4BU,"It's not easy being a teenager.  Belonging or not belonging to a clique or gang can bring horrible expectations--ones that aren't easy to fulfill.  Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an outsider, the way many outsiders are, but he is different.  Brendan is devoted to his love, Emily Kostich, and will do anything to protect her.  When she brushes off his love interest, she puts herself in harm's way.  She is killed and Brendan finds her washed in a creek near an underground tunnel.  From here he becomes Generation Next's Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) with all the resident toughness of the private eye, willing to get beat up to get some answers and meet the teenage equivalent of a head mobster, ""The Pin"" (Lukas Haas), whose presence is quiet, yet formidable.  His dress is with a cloak and he has a walking stick, making him a dead ringer for Barnabas Collins in the old vampire serial 'Dark Shadows'.  The gap bridge is between himself and ""Tug,"" a Pin thug who pummels Brendan until he is impressed enough to let him into his lair.  The young actors are so convincing that you get the impression that the high school they populate is one big, organized crime syndicate.  One sharp scene is where Brendan roughly negotiates with the school Vice Principal (Richard Roundtree of the first 'Shaft' film fame).  In the midst of the murder there are love interests and notes that provide clues in Brendan's investigation.

'Brick' is the little film that could--or one that can and does.  It is gripping and has all the anticipation of a whodunit with some violent, but convincing fight scenes.  Hardly a video game, the violence makes us feel every punch, like it was our own.  It is an artful enterprise with editing and music that underscores the nerve-wracking atmosphere of the movie.  We can feel the room spinning as Brendan looks up to his bedroom ceiling fan.  There is some needed irreverence to boot.  When ""The Pin""'s mom dotes over whether Brendan is sure about wanting apple juice for breakfast, we have to laugh.  'Brick' is an effective and often startling teenage murder mystery with a earnest cast and an intelligent script.  Rian Johnston deserves praises for his screenplay and directing skill.",1161475200,2,2215,4.840425531914893

For an added zinger, they decided to set it in a High School which I just can't swallow. It is the high school thing that gets me, it's so unrealistic it just loses me. And I get the idea that it's supposed to be semi-satire but it doesn't work for me and in my opinion just ends up being corny not clever",1161302400,3,441,4.0227272727272725
2570705,4,B000FKP4BU,"I'm not quite sure what Rian Johnson intended to accomplish with this film, but in my opinion the film's greatest accomplishment is highlighting the absurdity of film noir itself.

Many people criticize this film for the absurdity of its setting, its dialog, its characters, and the difficulty one encounters suspending disbelief for the 110 minutes of running time. I think such critics are engaging in a subtle hypocrisy. Film noir always was absurd, and always required suspension of disbelief. By placing those absurdities in an unfamilar historical setting, a clearly fictional and somewhat otherworldly setting of saturated black and white, classic noir may seem cohesive to modern audiences. Thus even the literalists among us can enjoy the classics of film noir. But do not fool yourselves. It is not real, and never was. Nobody ever talked that way, and nobody ever will, except perhaps in a life-imitates-art affectation.

Rian Johnson committed the arguably hostile act of forcing his audience to cope with the fact that a particular set of cinematic customs is at once enjoyable and absurd. By using a modern and realistic setting and shooting in color, he is forcing us to integrate the customs of noir into our own world, and obviously the result is jarring and hard to accept. Mr. Johnson is challenging us to enjoy it despite its absurdity, and indeed, to enjoy it because it is absurd. Many people do not know what to do with this movie because it seems to be playing both satirical and straight at the same time. Is it comedy? Is it noir? It is both at the same time; live with it. But it is also subversive because it is poking fun at the audience and our expectations. That can arouse anger but it should arouse nothing but admiration, because Rian Johnson makes a dramatically effective point through this movie.

The question is, is that enough? It is certainly clever, but is the gimmick sufficient to sustain the film? Almost, I believe, but not quite, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I have a very prosaic complaint, that the dialog is just too hard to understand. The comedy and subversiveness came through fine, but to enjoy it as a detective story, I would have preferred if I didn't have to work quite so hard to understand just what was being said.",1160611200,5,2278,4.776649746192893
2570706,1,B000FKP4BU,"There are only two movies in the past three years that were so bad that I stopped watching midway through. The first was Serenity. The second was Brick. The title of my Serenity review was, ""Looks Like Bad TV. Quacks Like Bad TV. Must Be....."" Since I already used that title for a review, I didn't use it again for this review of Brick, but rest assured it fits.

Brick, like Serenity, must have a serious cult following, because at the time of this writing both Brick and Serenity have an average of 4 stars and enough reviews to have led me to believe that the 4-star average ratings must have some credibility.

So I tried Brick based on the 4-star average rating.

Back at the beginning of the year I also tried Serenity based on the same premise: ""If it's got 4 stars it's got to be at least halfway decent, right?"" Wrong. Apparently the common denominator for both Brick and Serenity are the abundance of teens and young adults that for whatever reason are captivated by the plethora of bad TV plaguing prime time that targets the teen through 24 demo.

Brick is about high schoolers that all somehow have the dispositions, intelligence, vocabularies, mannerisms and lifestyles of no-personality 30+ year olds. There's murder, a criminalistic ""Kingpin"" complete with posse & bodyguards, a high society seductress and a hero (all the stuff found in any normal high-school, no?...uh, not really). The high school hero is looking for those responsible for the murder and he gets mixed up with the high school Kingpin, his high school henchman and the high school high society seductress.

Don't worry, no spoilers on the way....I didn't finishing watching, remember?

I'm thinking that Brick was trying to be like a high-schoolers-go-Pulp-Fiction or something. But it played more like a bad, R-rated after-school movie special.

So, if you haven't guessed already, I'd recommend completely missing this one. Don't buy it; don't rent it; don't waste 2 hours of your time when it comes on cable.

People who had a gripe about this movie spoke about the dialogue delivery coming from these ultra suburban teens but my problem with this little almost gem didn't lie there, in fact that ""hook"" as it were, had to be the film's best edge. What I didn't like was the feeling of a hundred films being welded together as one, but never truly extracting anything of real value from any of the movies it tries to emulate. The result is a fragmented sickly feeling empty storyline filled with the main character (played by Levitt) being beaten senseless at every turn. so the bottom line here is that maybe some other directors should try out this magnificent approach, but inject it with a little more coherent storytelling. A hook is only a hook. Once you have it, the rest of the movie needs to fall into place, not fall apart.

2570710,4,B000FKP4BU,"In addition to such celebrated, award-winning or nominated films as THE PIANIST, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, Focus Features has released a number of gripping crime/suspense movies, including THE CONSTANT GARDENER, THE ICE HARVEST, HOLLYWOODLAND and BRICK, which I recently caught up with on DVD since it never played at any theaters near me. Being a fan of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, among others, I'll admit I came to see how well writer/director Rian Johnson worked the gimmick of having contemporary high-schoolers speak in hard-boiled pulp-fiction slang -- but I stayed because I was riveted by the sinister mystery plot and touched by the heartache under hero Brendan's tough-loner demeanor. Think of it as RIVER'S EDGE written by Hammett. Teenagers tend to have their own language and their own ""outsiders vs. insiders"" way of looking at the world anyway. As a result, BRICK's hard-boiled lingo and dangerous doings turn out to be a good fit in a California high school setting, especially one as low on sunshine as the San Clemente locations used here.

The actors play it straight, inhabiting their roles with emotions that ring true in or out of a crime movie. Everybody's excellent, though I was particularly impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan (he's transitioning from child roles to young adult roles nicely; I look forward to seeing what his acting future holds), Matt O'Leary as Brendan's friend/sidekick The Brain, Lukas Haas as drug-dealer The Pin (love the fact that he runs his criminal empire from his perky mom's suburban home), Emilie de Ravin as Brendan's doomed love Emily (the flashbacks to their relationship show that outsider Brendan isn't always the easiest guy to get along with, which made their relationship all the more poignant for me), Meagan Good as another of Brendan's old flames, selfish Theater Club queen Kara, and Nora Zehetner in what I think of as The Mary Astor Role. I was also lucky enough to receive a copy of a collectors'-edition glossary of the argot used in BRICK. Ironically, the one word it doesn't define is ""brick"" (""drugs"") itself. BRICK transcends its gimmick to be a tense yet touching thriller on its own terms; it's well worth a rental (good extras, too, including commentary by the director and cast, auditions, and deleted/extended scenes).",1159488000,3,2360,5.12987012987013
2570712,1,B000FKP4BU,"For those not in the know, ""I love lamp"" is a quote from another Brick, he of ""Anchorman"" fame. I thought the quote was kinda fitting, in that the Brick from that movie made no sense either.

This is one of those movies where you're going to read a lot of overblown, pretentious reviews from people who like to pretend they ""get it"", throwing phrases like ""film noir"" at you like they actually have a clue what they're talking about. Ladies and gentlemen - IGNORE THEM ALL.

So, Brick, then. An attempt to fuse, oh-ho, ""film noir"" in a teenage environment. A nice idea, if it weren't so knuckle-chewingly embarrassing to watch. Hey, who wants to see 15 year olds talking like Humphrey Bogart, with all the conviction of an episode of Dawsons Creek? Anyone? Anyone?

The director was obviously so in love with his outrageous gimmick that he forgot to add even the slightest personality into his characters. This is one reason we do not care, one little bit, about anyone we're watching on screen - also the fact we don't believe ANYTHING we're watching, it's all so pointlessly ludicrous.

There is a good story buried under the corny dialogue and leaden delivery.  It would be no less powerful if these were REAL teenagers in front of us, saying REAL things that teenagers have to say. There doesn't have to be bling-speaking idiots or Clueless-style stereotypes in a teenage movie.  A film written by someone with the slightest idea of what teenage kids are actually like would be a start, (one person in the entire school has a mobile phone, for example) but what there DOES need to be is an actual story, with characters that people can relate to or at least care about - otherwise, what's the point?

Of course, the knee-jerk reactionary brigade are going to accuse me of being ignorant for not adoring their Movie Of The Year (that they were told to like). They'll say I didn't ""get it"". Oh, I got it - I just don't particularly want it.

2570714,4,B000FKP4BU,"This is a classic film noir with a twist. It has all of the elements of a film noir. You have you murder in a big city, and the follow-up investigation by the ""private eye"" (in this case a concerned amateur). You have the private eye's best friend who can somehow get information on anything and anyone. You have the drug kingpin (referred to only as ""The Pin"") and his hired muscle. You have your cheating female in distress and your femme fatal. The story is about doomed characters trapped in situations they are not responsible for. And here is the twist: all the characters are in high school.

As a recently graduated filmmaker, I have seen a lot of student films. The problem I have with most student films is that they want to have this epic story of drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. But all the parts are played by college students and you think...this is just a bunch of college students pretending to be drug dealers, mafiosos, hit men, etc. It would seem that a film noir composed entirely of high school students would never work. But it does.

I think the reason this film works is that it takes itself so seriously. Everything about it screams film noir. The characters talk like they are in a film noir. They say things like ""I've got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick."" and ""I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you."" You never hear people talk like that in real life. When you first see ""the pin"" he has a black cane and a cape. Seriously? Have you ever seen a high school student wearing a cape? But that's precisely why it works. It creates a whole new world that you have never seen and it doesn't back down for a second in presenting this world to you in all its gritty detail.

This film works and yet it knows that you are suspending a lot of disbelief and throws in a couple scenes to let you know that it is ok to laugh if you want to. There is a great scene where the ""private eye"" and ""the pin"" meet at the dining room table of the pin's house and his mother serves them lemonade.

The actors are all top notch. The camera work is great. The plot is twisty and unpredictable. Overall this was a very engaging and fun cinematic experience.

2570719,4,B000FKP4BU,"I read a synopsis of BRICK in a local newspaper that was oversimplified at best. It basically said the film was about a murder of a high school student and her friend, the loner Brendan invades the high school cliques to find out what happened. It sounded like a Hardy Boys with a murder and edge film. My guess is that the person who wrote the capsulated summary didn't see the film and based the summary on another summary. It turns out that BRICK is a sophisticated murder mystery that does in fact involve a young woman in high school named Emily (Emilie De Raven), and her former boyfriend Brendan (Joseph Gordon Leavitt) searches for the answers. The search brings him into a world of drugs, murder, and treachery. This world includes two girls Laura and Kara, both of whom seem to want Brendan, the drug leader Pin (Lucas Haas), a slightly disabled adult who still lives with his mother, Tugger (Noah Fleiss), the Pin's henchman who longs to be in charge and Emily's last boyfriend an addict known as Dode (Noah Sagan).

The film has a number of strengths. It is told exclusively through the point of view of Brendan and we never leave Brendan's world. We see things as he sees things and realize he's intelligent, perhaps more intelligent than most people realize. Even though it's not a typical high school world, we see the world from a high schooler's psychological perspective. The only difficulty is the plot is rather complex and there are so many characters, it can be hard to keep them straight. Fortunately the plot is compelling enough to maintain the viewer's interest so we wrestle with the complexities. It ends on a somewhat interesting note, but I'm not sure all viewers will believe everything we learn at the end. Still it's an intriguing film and well worth viewing.",1157760000,5,1792,4.707006369426751

And in true film noir style the person that pulled the trigger isn't even the one you end up blaming so much as the person that set the wheels in motion.

The dialogue takes a few minutes to adjust to but once you start emersing yourself into what the director has created you become part of it. Because it is an alternate world.

2570721,5,B000FKP4BU,"Pick up any of several volumes within the revered Library of America series (esp. Crime Novels of the 1930's and 1940's), and it is easy to see how noir fiction became such a rich source of creative movie-making. ""Brick"" is the latest in a series of great (""Chinatown,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Blue Velvet"") and very good movies (""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Heist,"" ""The Grifters,"" ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") that use the trappings of noir literature and earlier noir films. ""Brick"" adapts the dialogue and plots of Dashiell Hammett to a setting familiar to the screenwriter/director: a Southern California high school, the cliques of teenagers therein, and a familiarity with illicit drug dealing. The speech of the characters works because the teenagers are still kids, despite the serious themes and deadly consequences.

There's humor inherent in putting young people into the noir setting, but its not the noir that's the target of easy jokes. It's not so much a joke, as in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" that the main character gets himself beat up, but the humor comes from a tense confrontation between gumshoes and kingpin being interrupted by the kingpin's mom serving orange juice. Funny in ""Brick,"" but also a point of realism: drug dealers are often teenagers who do in fact bring their business (and violence) into their parents' kitchens. Much of the surreal ""where I eat lunch"" type of dialogue can be seen as a device to show how a lot of teens turn to dope and dope-dealing to shoehorn themselves into adult roles. The only meaningful adult-teen interaction, fittingly, comes between Gordon-Levitt's character and the school principal, played by the great Richard Roundtree.

The acting in this film is top-notch and a great pleasure to see. The empty high school setting reflects the isolation the protagonist lives in, and we are shown only the meaningful (or perhaps remembered) aspects of his days. Compare this to another earnest film about high school, ""Elephant,"" and it's easy to see how professional actors and the elimination of background clutter makes for a better presentation. It's also nice to see that ""Brick"" has a healthy number of passionate defenders on the Amazon page.

The Count-Dracula resembling dope dealer is hilarious, as is his pumped up bodyguard---""camp"" a la David Lynch's old work, would be a good description of much of this film.

2570734,5,B000FKP4BU,"""Brick"" uses a familiar style to tell a convential story, but it all unfolds in an unconventional way.  It provides an involving story with rich characters, but in a strange way, those aren't the aspects we pay attention to.  Instead, we're focused ont he way it all unfolds.

For those familar with the 1930's crime novels, or even current and well known Films Noir, this style may not be clear right away.  And for those not familiar with either of the previously stated, it will never be clear, but you'll have fun watching it anyway.  ""Brick"" tells it's narrative in the Film Noir style and the result is somewhere between 'Memento' and 'L.A Confidential.'

To provide the details of the plot would be unfair to the audience who has nto yet seen the picture.  But I will say that it involves a loner high school student named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who's recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Emilie' de Ravin).  When she truns up dead in a sewage drain, he takes it upon himself to investigate the murder.  Although a loner, Brendan is on the up and up with each of the high schools' social classes and it quickly becomes clear that his lack of friends is by choice.

As he questions, figths and sacrifices his way to the truth, he encounters several characters that will either help him or hurt him, sometimes both, and more than once.  But the details of the plto aren't as much fun as the unique dialogue or the film's gritty look.  ""Brick"" has been directed by Rian Johnson, a first time director who clearly shows a talent for evoking mood and energy on the screen.  If the plot doesn't totally mesh, it doesn't matter, as often it would with traditional films noir.  This one takes place at a modern urban High School and all the evidence doesn't have to add up; because while they are speaking and acting like they are good at scheming or investigating, they are still students in high school afterall.  There is a scene that demonstrates this perfectly when a character named ""The Pin"" has cookies and juice served to him by his mother as he has a meeting with Brendan about 'the brick' of the film's title.

There are shocking moments in the film that surprised me.  The movie has twists and turns that should be apparent early on, because the film uses the traditional cliches of the crime novel, but I was easily distracted from this by the fact that these are teenagers.  Brendan occupies every moment of screen time and we know just what he knows when he knows it.  We want him to solve the crime and bring justice to those responsible.  Does justice come?  I will not say, but finding out sure is fun.",1157068800,2,2631,4.567164179104478

 Brick is one amazing film due to its heavy use of tough-guy/gal talk and typical film noirish characters juxtaposed against a suburban Californian teen environment. But it simply works - you laugh at the funny parts and are on the edge of your seat at the tense parts.

Then again, they might also work in the lunatic fringes of bad-independent films where teenage girls recite poetic blubber while playing dischordic melodies on mommy's grand piano?  All told, this film has one of the most ridiculous scripts and premises I've ever seen, and I would realistically estimate that I've seen over 3,000 movies. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that ""swallowing a brick"" would be much easier than swallowing this implausible, self-important piece of fluff.

2570738,3,B000FKP4BU,"It's quite a precocious move to use 1940's-style film noir narrative techniques and place them in a contemporary high school setting, but first-time writer/director Rian Johnson, apparently inspired by the works of Dashiell Hammett, does an intriguing though overly convoluted job here as he focuses his labyrinth plot on Brendan, a teenager searching for his ex-girlfriend Emily only to find her murdered. The rhythm of Johnson's dialogue is peppered with an often inscrutable combination of presumably current teen slang and period noirish-type barbs. The result can sound like hipster's gibberish, and this is where the DVD's English for the Hard of Hearing subtitle feature becomes useful in catching everything being said and getting a chance to understand what the characters are exactly saying.

The movie's timeline jumps back and forth from the moment Brendan discovers Emily's dead body at the entrance of a concrete waterway tunnel. His murky investigation has him dealing with a gallery of fellow teens who play out their high-school stereotypes. There's nerdy Brain, a social outcast devoted to Brendan; drama queen Kara, who easily manipulates guys to meet her needs; spaced-out punker Dode, with whom Emily becomes attached after Brendan; a thuggish bully named Tugger; and even a doe-eyed femme fatale named Laura, who may or may not be on Brendan's aide.

The most interesting character is the Pin, a dead-eyed drug dealer with an Everett Sloane-type limp. A long way from his little Amish boy in ""Witness"", Lukas Haas plays the Pin with a curiously unnerving ambiguity. By now settled with his indie cred thanks to ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Latter Days"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Brendan with a closed-off world-weariness suitable for his adolescent Bogie-style character. Meagan Good also makes quite an impression as Kara whether looking like a Cabaret-style Liza or sporting full kabuki makeup. In fact, I wish she switched roles with Nora Zehetner, who plays the pivotal role of Laura with an unfortunately whispery uncertainty. However, it's fun to see 1970's blaxploitation icon Richard Roundtree (""Shaft"") play the put-upon vice principal with such unforced authority.

Instead of going for the obvious black-and-white look of classic noir, Johnson has Steve Yedlin's clean, off-kilter cinematography, a major plus in adding to the moody atmosphere. The plot twists can be clever but without true emotional resonance, and the various elements have not been connected in the most dramatically effective manner. The result is a film that becomes as frustrating as it is creative. The DVD contains a feature-length commentary track from an especially lively Johnson and various crew and cast members, eight deleted and extended scenes interspersed with production stills and Johnson's introductions, and dispensable audition tapes for Zehetner and Noah Segan, who plays Dode.",1156636800,6,2896,5.44543429844098

The plot itself is a bit of Hammett's ""Red Harvest"" (possibly his greatest work) and Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"". It's tense, a little convoluted, but breathtaking to behold. The performances are all spot-on and the juxtaposition of the 30's/40's era dialogue set in a comtemporary high school never seems silly.

The characters, the double-crosses, the shifting allegiances, all were pulled off spectacularly.  The setting of the story around a high school student played nicely into the form by having the protagonist play fast and loose with the administration, local toughs, and a band of dealers who just completed a major sale while he tries to understand who killed an ex-girlfriend.  The ONLY issue I have is that while the detective noir aspect of Brick is flawless, the characters were all too confident and played too well to type to really be convincing as high school students.

It also didn't hurt that there were little insider jokes referencing The Maltese Falcon, Miller's Crossing, and other great hardboiled movies.

And for the reviewer wondering what a ""yegg"" is: a tough guy, often an ex-boxer, slumming for a crime boss.

When I first saw previews for this film I was entranced, the camera shots, style, jargon, and characters were spot on. Even when I began to realize from trailers that this was a high school Noir I didn't harbor any reservations. I don't quite know how to describe the genuis of the film, but it takes a somewhat novel if not seemingly misguided idea and twists it into one of the greatest Noir detective stories I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.

Not only that, but a seemingly incomprehensible story line is made so elementary that a grade schooler could follow it.

The characters, especially the main character, Brendan, and his friend and confidant, Brain, use a very strange slang to communicate. It's difficult to follow, but interesting. The whole time I was watching, I was trying to find out what was going on with this subculture that seemed to exist beneath the veneer of a high school. There grows a feeling of urgency in Brendan's situation, although we're not exactly sure what that is just yet... He's trying to do something - and given his actions - it must be something important. It was somewhat suspenseful and interesting enough to keep me watching. The characters are also fairly interesting, even if only in their mysteriousness. Tug, who is muscle for ""The Pin"", is a crazy MF'er and helps to make the story more edgy with his outbursts of violence and his lack of attempt to control them.

2570756,5,B000FKP4BU,"Rian Johnson's debut film Brick caused something of a minor sensation among critics and discerning cineastes earlier this year when it won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award, the John Cassavetes Award for the best film production with a budget under $500,000. Brick re-imagines high school life through a 1940s film noir lens as Johnson populates his film with terse, fast-talking characters and all kinds of plot twists reminiscent of a Dashiell Hammett novel.

Johnson focuses on tiny details captured in close-up shots, like a burning cigarette or lingering shots of people's shoes or, most memorably, Emily's dead hand resting in shallow water. Many of these visual cues are nods to the cinema of David Lynch, complete with a shot of a ceiling fan that evokes the surreal filmmaker's short-lived T.V. show Twin Peaks. While characters tend to speak in the same cryptic fashion of a Lynch film, the snappy dialogue that flies fast and furious between characters is more akin to the way people speak in Howard Hawks films.

Much like the Coen brothers film Miller's Crossing, Brick adopts stylized noir slang but in this case, contrasts it with a contemporary look that works surprisingly well. Like Gabriel Byrne's character in Miller's Crossing, Brendan is a smart guy who is often shown thinking as he tries to stay two steps ahead of everyone else. He is someone who is able to figure out all the angles and play them to his advantage but in the process gets repeatedly beaten up (much like Byrne's character).

Even though Brick references Lynch and the Coens, it still feels like an original work made by someone with a distinct vision. The cast is uniformly excellent and handles Johnson's stylized prose perfectly. It's a dense text that has to be delivered in a specific way for the movie to work the way it does. To his credit, Johnson makes some fascinating choices in how he frames scenes and uses unusual close-ups with a minimalist score that is atmospheric but not obvious about it. It's a movie that constantly keeps us guessing, not knowing what to expect next but he displays enough confidence in his direction that we trust him to take us wherever he wants. Brick is an amazing debut film with an ingenuous premise and such a novel way of executing it that you find yourself immediately drawn into this world that Johnson has created.

There are eight deleted and extended scenes each introduced by Johnson. There is more footage of Laura's party with the entire performance of ""The Sun Whose Rays are all Ablaze"" that she sings.

""The Inside Track: Casting the Roles of Laura and Dode"" features audition footage of Nora Zehetner and Noah Segan reading for their roles. They are both excellent and it is obvious why they got the roles.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by writer/director Rian Johnson, actors Noah Segan and Nora Zehetner, producer Ram Bergman, production designer Jodie Tillen and costume designer Michele Posch. Johnson talks about how he started off with no connections in the film industry and that it took six to seven years of shopping around his ""weird, little script"" to various production companies before he finally got the chance to make his movie. Instead of having everyone talk over each other, Johnson interviews each person about their experiences making the movie.

2570758,5,B000FKP4BU,"I have to say it, ""Brick"" is probably the best movie I have seen this year so far, and I don't think I'll see another that will top it.  I had heard about ""Brick"" for a while now, and when I heard the premise of it, I knew that it was something that I would have to check out.  I'm glad I did, because not only did I end up enjoying it the first time I saw it, but I watched it again the next day.  Not many films can do that for me, but this one most certainly did.  There was no way I could have ever bet that I would've ended up loving this movie the way I do.

If you're unfamiliar with the approach to the movie, it's pretty much a detective-murder-whodunit movie with a catch; it's set in modern times and it involves high school kids.  Yet, the kids talk in the manner that you would expect from your typical hard-boiled detective movie.  The story concerns Brendan Frye, who is contacted by his ex-girlfriend by phone.  On the phone, she sounds frightened and troubled, but doesn't say much about what is the matter.  Two days later, she ends up dead.  Brendan knows that she got involved with the wrong crowd, so in order to find out who is responsible for her death and why, he has to go in deep into the underground drug world that has consumed a good amount of his schoolmates.  The deeper he goes, the more risk he puts himself in.

This film is extremely well done and well made, and that caught me off guard.  I wasn't expecting a movie like this, nor was I expecting that I would end up loving it so much.  The film seems innocent and fun at a glance until you really get into it, and then you realize how dark and brutal it can get.  Just because it involves high school kids, it doesn't mean it's child's play.  It's film noir at its finest, and it even pokes fun at itself a little here and there, but overall it's a pretty dark and serious movie.  What really sells the movie in the end is the great performances from the cast, especially the lead actor.

Because of how odd and different ""Brick"" is, there's a good chance that more people will end up not liking it so much.  That is the risk these kinds of movies take, but it's nice to see something that isn't so ""commercial friendly"" for a change.  It stands out, and that's something that has to be admired to some degree.  I would recommend renting it first because of this.  Also, I recommend that you see it more than once.  As much as I liked it the first time, I really appreciated it for what it was more during the second viewing.  The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer, sadly.  There are some deleted/extended scenes, audition tapes from two of the actors in the movie, and cast/crew commentary.  It's a shame that they don't give you the trailer, which I thought was really good.  I also would've liked to see some behind-the-scenes features.

""Brick"" took me for a ride and I have to say that I loved every minute of it.  It's an exhilarating and brilliant film that takes a lot of chances without apologizing to anybody in the end.  It's one you'll either love or hate, but I think it's definitely worth the time checking it out.  If you're looking for something that isn't typical or dull, then I highly recommend it.  It's too soon to say, but I think if you give it enough time it could become a classic.  It's high up on my list of favorite movies now, and that only took two days.  -Michael Crane",1156032000,148,3391,4.246875

There seems to be a lot of praise for the 'witty dialog' in this movie.

Don't believe it! It is not so smart - just basic 'dialog replacement' that appears to the uninitiated as code.

Those who crack the code (and therefore understand the dialog) feel a sense of accomplishment (like a Sudoku puzzle solver) and therefore, since they feel smart, they assume that the dialog must be witty.

It works like this:

Think of a well used phrase (e.g. Who is he/she hanging with)

Replace with some teen like verbiage (Who is he/she eating with)

and you have it!

If this seems like witty dialog to you then go ahead and waste your hard earned cash on this trash.

2570761,5,B000FKP4BU,"'Brick' is smart.  It's a twist on the general crime noir, giving it an all too real feel by involving our deteriorating youth.  The majority of this film takes place on school grounds or in mom and pops basement, but it never feels amateur or immature.  This is mostly due to the cast of young actors who play their parts with sincerity and caution, not to appear too 'high-schoolish' while never crossing the line as to appear 'too old for the game' if you know what I mean.  These are the high school students of today.

When Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets a message from his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin) claiming to need help of some sort he finds himself delving deep into the underground ring of high-school crime, and when Emily shows up dead this leads Brendan to encounter and befriend (sort-of) all sorts of twisted teens, from the 26+ drug king known as The Pin (Lukas Haas) to his impatient strong arm Tug (Noah Fleiss) to the mysterious rich girl Laura (Nora Zehetner) who seems all to eager to help Brendan in his journey to uncover Emily's killer.

Joseph plays Brendan, the loner student who always hangs on the outskirts of trouble, with enough subtlety and lax to make him believable.  You know he wants to help but you get the feeling it's not just because he feels he has too; I think he just knows that he can.  I've been a fan of Joseph's for a while now, favoring his brilliant work in Mysterious Skin over unworthy Oscar nominee Terrance Howard last year, and with 'Brick' Levitt continues to prove his weight in gold.  Meagan Good also turns out a convincing conniving manipulative tramp in the form of Drama Queen Kara, and Mike O'Leary does a great job as Brendan's confidant and friend The Brain.

The script is also a major plus, creating an almost poetic lingo for today's teens, giving the film an interesting perspective and leading to some very interesting conversations.  Since there are a lot of those it's good to have dialog that grabs you and holds your attention.  Some of the best dialog is shared between Brendan and The Brain, the both of them spitting off line after line fluently and effortlessly.  As far as plot boilers go 'Brick' pulls no punches and it delivers 100% giving us something new, fresh and unique, something that if done wrong could have been disastrous, but with a brilliant script and acting to boot 'Brick' easily becomes one of the most fascinating and memorable thrillers in the recent years.",1155600000,4,2471,4.678983833718245
2570782,4,B000FKP4BU,"A difficult, brilliant film, ""Brick"" is as noir as anything written by Dashiell Hammet.  Writer/director Rian Johnson has a big future, and his next contract will probably be in the 7-8 figure bracket; Hollywood will see the movie for what it is, money in the bank.  It is difficult to equate the depth of character, motive, and experience depicted in the film with your average 20-year-old, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, ""Brick"" is easy to enjoy.

The actors; the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, imparts the gravitas of any actor in the major leagues like Pacino or De Niro, and Pin's prime enforcer, Noah Fleiss, carries off a smoldering performance reminiscent of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential.

2570783,4,B000FKP4BU,"This is not a review of the movie, which has been aptly reviewed as one of the most inovative, independent, film noir which will inevitably become a cult classic.  But rather, this is a review of the DVD that Brick is on.  The deleted scenes are great, and the introductions are pretty good; much more useful than anything that greats like Kevin Smith and Terry Gilliam have offered.  Unfortunately the Behind The Scenes Casting of Laura and Dode are only pitiful audition tapes of a single scene for the respective characters, no longer than ten minutes between the two.  There is a commentary track thankfully.  It's really the only special feature that's worth it's weight on the DVD; which is floating it's so light.

Unfortunately Rian Johnson doesn't have Smith's penchant for special features.

2570784,5,B000FKP4BU,"Ever wonder what ""The Maltese Falcon"" would be like if it was set in high school?  Well, I have.  And even if you haven't, Rian Johnson's ""Brick"", an homage to classic film noirs, is well worth a look.

While there's many parallels to Dashiell Hammett's ""The Maltese Falcon"" (even the item the title refers to is sort of a modern equivalent of the ""black bird""), as well as Raymond Chandler's mysteries and other stories of the genre, ""Brick"" has more than enough unique twists and turns of its own.  The story begins when anti-social reject Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) accepts a phone call from his ex-girlfriend (""Lost""'s Emilie deRavin).  She rambles off a series of slang terms and nicknames Brendan's never heard of.  Brendan immediately sets out to meet her face to face by infiltrating one social clique after another, starting by getting himself invited to a party hosted by a wealthy cheerleader and her jock boyfriend.  Two days later, Brendan discovers his ex's body.  He hides the body so he can bring the people behind her death to justice himself, at the same time making himself a suspect in her murder.

Several of the classic noir hallmarks are there.  There's the well-informed sidekick (Matt O'Leary), the intimidating crime boss (college-aged drug-dealer ""The Pin"", played by Lukas Haas), his hired muscle (Noah Fleiss), the troublesome junkie (Noah Segan), the by-the-book authority figure (Richard ""John Shaft"" Roundtree) and not one but two drop-dead-gorgeous femme fatales, cheerleader Laura (Nora Zehetner) and drama club member Kara (Meagan Good).  The hero dishes abuse, takes abuse, and cracks wise like a Humphrey Bogart character.  But everyone delivers their lines (riddled with slang terms from the 30's, 40's, and 50's, as well as several invented by Johnson) and actions so casually and with such conviction that they seem natural and the movie never devolves into spoof.  And, like any good film noir, the movie stays gritty without ever being crass or in bad taste.  All this with just a dollop of high school angst in the mix.

Nathan Johnson's score is one of the highlights of the film.  Like the movie, the score has an Indie feel, a contemporary feel, and a retro feel, all at once, with a hint of jazz.  Reoccuring character themes lend dramatic emphasis to the film.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance will make you forget all about the role he played in the comedy series ""3rd Rock from the Sun.""  But the true stand-out performance is by Nora Zehetner, who is glamorous in the best old-fashioned sense, and could definitely go places.",1155513600,3,2583,4.992990654205608

I'm ordinarily parsimonious with ""5 star"" ratings. But as someone who discovered Raymond Chandler in my high school's library, BRICK got the drop on me early and wouldn't let up. This movie's transposition of the hard-boiled noir genre to a high school setting is completely successful on its own terms. And it avoids the pitfalls of parody to become a pastiche that can stand on its own.

There are a lot of things to savor in this film, but the main one is the dialogue. (Be sure to turn on the subtitles to get their full flavor.) Flowery and anachronistic, writer/director Rian Johnson obviously had a great time getting these lines just right. The protagonist, Brendan, doesn't have a merely dry wit; this guy is downright dehydrated.

And there is more to savor than the words. For some reason, I loved the way that the high school seems perennially deserted.

Being one of his first feature films, Rian Johnson has struck gold with this indie movie, making us wonder what he could accomplish with a larger budget (BRICK was made on less than $500,000).

The story seems pedestrian enough. A high schooler named Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 3rd Rock from the Sun) takes it upon himself to investigate the death of his former girlfriend Emily (Emilie de Ravin, LOST). The discoveries launch Brendan into dark corners where drugs, thugs, and friends combine to form a triangle of deadly proportions. Pulling heavily from noir films of old, this updated look and story has a unique place amongst the genre. Brendan's niche group cares nothing for cheerleading squads or who's dating who. The level of sophistication is upped to extreme levels, showing us a danger and intellect amongst the teen population never before seen on celluloid.

The noir comparisons are the most fascinating. The cloudy skies, telephone booths, and shadowy locales give an underpinning sense of dread, much like films from the 30s and 40s. There's even a piano playing portion that obviously pays homage to the ""Play it again, Sam"" lovers.

Shot on location at San Clemente High School (the directors alma mater) and edited on a home computer, this amazing flick will win audiences over with its wonderful camera angles, dark themes and excellent script. The acting, too, is well done with Joseph Gordon-Levitt appearing in every scene and pulling the quality of the entire production even higher.

My only gripe is the sound. Editing must've been tough and several times lines were garbled or mumbled, making it necessary to rewind and find out what was said.

Watch out Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Howard. Rian Johnson is on your tails!

2570789,4,B000FKP4BU,"Wow, what a thrill to see a movie that delights in the visual and doesn't let the images just lie flat on the screen.  This movie is not an homage to noir, it IS pure, unrepentant noir.  The twisting dialogue, the complex plot, the gorgeous photography, the femme fatale with the flower in her hair, the amoral vixen, the gang war and even the clueless mother of the vicious gangster are all here - transported to a high school setting but still set firmly in LA.  This is no ""Clueless"" or ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" which watered down their original plots for a younger audience, this is noir in all its gritty splendor.

Joseph Gordon Levitt is the best thing about this movie. He's completely believable as a high school gumshoe out to solve the murder of the dame... um, girl he once loved.  The rest of the cast does a great job, notably Meagan Good as the girl who is ""Bad News"" and Lukas Haas as the Pin.  Nora Zehetner is partially successful in her role but her acting isn't quite as strong as the others.

Great movie that was all but ignored in its original run (did it even play theaters?)  but deserves a second life on DVD.  Pick it up.",1155254400,2,1153,4.325581395348837

It was as terse and well-acted as anything of this genre that I've seen - with several delightful twists I didn't see coming.

***SPOILER***

I LOVED the scene where the lead actor's mother is in the kitchen talking to her son about being out of orange juice - talking to him like he was a kid (which he was) while he is having a ""meeting"" with ""The Pin"" at the kitchen table - the juxtaposition is hilarious, clever, and a needed moment of comic relief.

2570802,5,B000FKP4BU,"Writer/Director Rian Johnson's ""Brick"" is a film-noir, detective movie that is incredibly elabortate, surreal, and filled with really good-30s like dialogue. It's like a classic Humphrey Bogart movie, except with high school kids. Needless to say, not everyone will like it. When we meet Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who proved he could really act in Manic) he's looking at the dead body of a girl. The story jumps back two days and we see this same girls hand slip a note inside a locker. The locker belongs to Brendan of course and the note gives him direction to go to a certain payphone and wait. When it rings, it's his ex-girlfriend Emily (Emilie De Ravin, 'The Hills Have Eyes')...Sounding distraught, she rambles on for a few minutes; Saying she's scared and asking for help, but then a car drives by causing her to hang up and flee. After doing some investigating, Brendan finally meets up with Emily who asks him to forget about it. The next day, she's dead. As Brendan searches for the culprit, with the help of his friend Brain (Matt O'Leary), he winds up in a surreal whirlwind of drugs, deceit, and murder. Overall, it sounds like pretty standard stuff...But it's a lot more elaborate than that. Making a ""whodunit"" movie nowadays is hard; It's been done so many times, that you can pretty much see every twist a mile away. That's not so with this film. The plot twists are piled on heavily and you don't know ""whodunit"" until the very end, but this movie doesn't rest its fate in the hands of whodunit. What happens as Brendan tries to figure out what's going on is actually really entertaining to. As I said, the dialogue is very Bogart-like;

Coming from high-school kids (although Levitt's 26 and De Ravin is in her twenties I think) dialogue like this should seem campy and unrealistic, but it works. Even the stuff in this movie that seems overly campy (there's a character named The Pin, a big time drug runner who's got a hired muscle named Tug; Both of whom are a big part of the story) works perfectly in the way this film is made. This movie is very elaborate, so pay close attention to it. The cinematography and the gloomy mood the film has is great. If you're into interesting and elaborate films (this movies does remind me of The Machinist a little bit. Only because of the cinematography and the music; The story has no similarities) then definitely see this movie.

2570803,5,B000FKP4BU,"To know whether or not you would be interested in watching ""Brick,"" all you have to do is answer a rather odd little question.  Are you interested in seeing a Dashiell Hammett hard-boiled detective story played out as a high school film noir?  Now if you are a fan of Hammett and the book and/or movie version of ""The Maltese Falcon"" the idea of a teenagers spouting dialogue like they were Sam Spade and Kaspar Gutman trapped in younger bodies might be enough to put you off your lunch already.  Furthermore, if you are well versed in American cinema the idea might bring to mind Alan Parker's ""Bugsy Malone,"" which put Jodie Foster and a bunch of other pre-teens in a 1930s Chicago gangster movie.  But that weird little experiment was not half bad and ""Brick"" is a lot more successful in trying to pull this off and is a lot closer to ""Sin City"" than to ""Bugsy Malone.""  ""Brick"" won the Sundance Film Festival's Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision, and you have to grant writer-director Rian Johnson that much for sure.

At the start of the film, Johnson's hero Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds the dead body of Emily (Emilie de Ravin) in a drainage ditch.  She had called him earlier in the day pleading for help and later saw her in the back seat of a car as it drove away.  Now she is dead.  So he decides to find out who killed her and starts backtracking on what she had been doing and with whom.  The only one Brendan can trust is the Brain (Matt O'Leary), who is basically a walking computer who observes a lot by just watching while it seems he is working on his computer or solving a Rubik's Cube.  This leads him to the high school drug ring and the major players, although not without Brendan getting his face smashed in a few times in his effort to shake things up and see what happens next.

The other players are the Pin (Lukas Haas), Tugger (Noah Fleiss), Dode (Noah Segan), and Brad Bramish (Brian J. White), with Laura (Nora Zehetner) and Kara (Meagan Good) as the femme fatales.  Beyond that last alliterative appellation I do not want to say who is what because half the fun here is in watching Brendan find out who is what.  The other half is listening to what these characters have to say, because the rhythms are Hammet's, but the glossary is often idiosyncratic and the dynamic is pure high school (My favorite is when Brendan is engaged in a conversation that has descended down to both parties saying ""Yeah"" a lot and he finally shoots back, ""There's a thesaurus in the library. Yeah is under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait"").

While for the most part this movie takes place in a Charlie Brown world where adults are absent, there are a few notable exceptions.  Brendan has been of use to Assistant Vice Principal Trueman (Richard Roundtree) in the past, but that relationship is now tenuous.  However, it does suggest that the ""bulls"" are out there somewhere, and Brendan has to get to the bottom of things without or at least before the authorities get involved.  Then there is the Pin's mother (Reedy Gibbs), whom I mention simply because very rarely do you get to see a criminal mastermind's mother putter around the kitchen making sure everybody has something to drink.

Everybody in ""Brick"" is dead serious about what they are doing and they never blink an eye at all of the verbiage that comes spilling out every time they start flapping their gums.  The illusion of this strange reality is maintained from start to finish, when Brendan confronts the guilty party in the middle of a high school football field.  At that point Johnson most clearly invites comparisons to ""The Maltese Falcon"" because at this point he knows that you have either bought the game plan here and will enjoy the more overt homage, or this would be the final nail in the coffin.  For me the results are certainly enough to warrant rounding up on this 2005 film and to hope that Johnson can find something equally creative for his next venture.  That will be hard to do, but you have to feel that based on ""Brick"" he might be able to carry it off and not be a one cult classic wonder.

Final Note: Is Emilie de Ravin ever allowed to play a character that is not pregnant?  I am just asking, because after ""Roswell"" and ""Lost"" we are now at the point where that seems to be all she plays and I can just see Hollywood execs saying ""We need an actress to play a young pregnant woman, go get Emilie de Ravin.""  If she ever does become pregnant for real people are going to look at her and ask what movie she is doing it for.",1155081600,2,4541,4.473939393939394

Brendan an edgy high school student received a note from his ex-girlfriend asking for a meeting. The meeting turns out to be a phone call in which she briefly tells of the trouble she has gotten into before expressing fear at an approaching car. After she hangs up Brendan tracks her down and she tells him that she is fine and there aren't any problems. The next day Brendan finds her dead and charges himself with the task of finding her killer......

The good: I was pretty hyped about this movie after viewing the trailer. It looked cool and edgy. The film noir concept for this movie was a good idea and I thought the concept of the movie was good.

The Bad: I felt like the writer ""tried"" too hard when putting the dialogue for this film together. There was too much of an attempt to make the characters appear cool and edgy through their slang which often made it hard to understand what the hell they were saying. I found myself on several occasions rewinding and re-listening so I could understand what they were talking about. I felt like they were speaking in white ebonics or something of that nature. The characters all felt waaay too mature to be high school kids. Their reactions to situations and there motivations made them feel more like they were 20ish or 30ish instead of like the teenagers they were portraying. This gave the movie an odd feel. I think this was done because teens like to think they come across as mature as the characters in this movie do (Target audience is teens). The characters should have been made older or the story and plot should have been dumbed down some. I also found myself wondering where all the adults were. A movie about high school kids that was devoid for the most part of any adult characters (Parents, Police, Etc.)

Overall: The movie wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. It was a great idea with just so so execution. Worth renting and checking out but don't by it first.",1154995200,4,1962,4.54957507082153

2570807,2,B000FKP4BU,"I was not originally planning to review this film, as it didn't make much of an impression on me. What changed my mind was the fact that all of the reviews posted so far are highly favorable, so I felt a dissenting opinion should be represented. I had heard that Brick was done in film noir style set in a modern high school. What I didn't realize until I started watching it is how far they took this gimmick. Brick is not really pure film noir; it has a strange, surreal style of its own. The settings are mostly deserted landscapes. The school that these ""kids"" attend is usually devoid of students, aside from the few who are playing in the scene. Characters are frequently shown lethargically lying on the pavement. There is a perpetual mood of exaggerated somberness. I'm sure there is a deep explanation of what this is supposed to convey or symbolize, but I just found it oppressively dull after a few minutes. The high school characters exist in a world almost devoid of adults. In this respect, it is reminiscent of Bugsy Malone, the musical gangster movie starring all children. That film, however, was lighthearted and unapologetically silly. Brick, by contrast, is heavy, serious and stilted. It's hard to judge the acting in a film like this. I suppose, given the concept and direction, they all do a pretty good job. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fine impression of a teen-aged Bogart --if you can buy into it. In a way, the super-cool teens of Brick are magnified versions of the hipster cast of shows like Beverly Hills 90210. While most teens in real life are a balance between cool and self-conscious awkwardness, in Brick everyone exhibits flawless film version sang-froid at all times.

I should confess that I'm not a huge fan of film noir. Even when watching a classic film of this genre, or perhaps a modern David Mamet film, I may enjoy it on one level (if the acting and plot are good), but I can't help but thinking things like ""who really talks like this all the time?"" In Brick, what we have is a double layer of artifice -teens imitating an unnatural adult manner. I just couldn't get into it.",1154736000,12,2121,4.611111111111111
2570808,5,B000FKP4BU,"If someone were to storm into my office, throw down a heavy leather bag filled with millions of dollars, and demand a movie out of me, I'd probably make something along the lines of Brick.

 A film not only masterful for its stylistic directing, but for a production that rivals anything to have come out in quite some time. Brick is sure to please the smaller group of moviegoers, meaning those that can accept the film for what it is: different.

 This is a film with an imperfect blend. There is the cultist's favorite noir, the gritty suburban life of today, and the impasse teen flick that for some reason is stunningly original on a level not seen before.

 The story, while complex in form, is at the core a simple mystery. Brendan Frye (Levitt) is a loner at a high school mixed with problems from the inner street. After happening upon a message from his ex-girlfriend, Frye follows the murky leads to help her out. Unfortunately, what Frye stumbles upon is a loose string of problems that seemingly bring him nonlinearly from one point to another. With each discovery is another step away from the truth and one more reminder that this may be a bad idea.

 Having overstayed his welcome in teenage filler, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (3rd Rock From The Sun, Ten Things I Hate About You) graduates with flying colors and accentuates into what might be regarded as the modern day Serpico. Levitt not only steals the film, but nails the character right smack into the skull. He takes the source material and goes the extra mile creating one of the better anti-heroes this century has seen thus far.

 Everything works here. From bar none the most eccentric dialogue since 1971's A Clockwork Orange to a chilling and fitting soundtrack by composer Nathan Johnson, who takes hints from the late Bernard Herrmann. There is a mood to this film that is neither claustrophobic nor horrifying yet glides dangerously around those lines at all times.

 Inarguably one of the most exciting and refreshing pictures since 2004's experimental Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Director Rian Johnson much like Michael Gondry paints a modern classic that is sure to have people spinning in and out of their seats. This is a story that follows you home with characters that might be your friends.

 It is a relief to have a breath of fresh air in an industry so heavily polluted with either the same thing or something less spectacular. If the year's previous films are a testament to the building blocks of American cinema, Brick is a pillar to modern film making and one not to be missed.",1152835200,9,2579,4.727678571428571

2570810,5,B000FKP4BU,"What Brick brings to the table is perhaps the most refreshing look at the genre of Film Noir in years. Rian Johnson is able to take the critical elements of the genre and transpose them on a fresh new locale. The use of a Southern California highschool as the backdrop is beautifully done. Most of all, Johnson is able to appreciate and use the genre without falling back on the 1940s.

The screenplay is exquisite. The developed slang is not just perfect for a film noir but truly perfect for the culture being shown. What is most amazing is how surprisingly real the film seems, despite the fact that yes - it is a bunch of teenagers who are caught up in a world so devoid of reality that its hard to believe. Yet somehow Johnson brings in elements of real-life high school drug culture, real-life Southern California, and most of all real-life fantasies about how to act when you are part of these cultures.

This was the best film I've seen in years, to be honest. I'm disapointed it has basically been predetermined for this to remain a ""cult classic."" It could have marked a re-emergence of Film Noir, arguably one of the most interesting and conflicted genres of film (in my opinion).

He uses all the tropes of the genre. Also in the commentary he argues that most movies about high school are from an adult's perspective, that is, what matters to the students is not serious -- ""a phase"". But, he says, it is serious for them. This is not a normal ""high school and coming of age"" film. The crimes are serious and sometimes grisly. Somehow, improbably, the film works driven by a wonderful cast.
