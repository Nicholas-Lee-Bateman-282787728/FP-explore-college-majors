2062470,5,B00024I18W,"The Ghost in the Shell name is best known for the animated movie released in Japan and the United States in the mid 1990s, based on the popular manga by Masamune Shirow. In 2002 Production I.G. started ambitious work on an evolutionary animated series heavily based on the manga, with more input from Shirow. In June 2004, the series will make its American debut on the Cartoon Network, followed by this DVD release in July.
Stand Alone Complex then is the title for the TV series, which takes place independently from the manga and theatrical movies. Crafted wonderfully, the series features a balance of intelligence, technology, rebellious counter-culture, sadness, action, and cerebral plots that, while typical of Japanese manga, go far and above what American viewers typically receive. Movie watchers will see some familiar characters and settings - the main character, Major Motoko Kusanagi, is the tactical commander of Public Peace Section 9, a described governmental ""offensive force against crime"" led by the older Daisuke Aramaki.
Section 9's members are nearly all cyborgs - military-grade constructed bodies and cyberbrains that host the human brain imprint (essentially the soul or ""ghost"" of a person, the ""shell"" being the body). Batou, the muscular gung-ho cyborg, and Togusa, the semi-normal relative newcomer (he's essentially a human with some cybernetic implants) should also be familiar to movie viewers, as is Ishikawa. Other more one-dimensional team members, like Saito, Pazu, and Boma, will probably be more familiar for manga readers. The Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga) round out the active Section 9 staff, sentient AI tanks that provide a bit of humor with their child-like, yet compelling, mannerisms, personalities and voices.
The overall series plot and title stem from the Laughing Man case, though there are plenty of individual one-episode stories. The episodes are frequently introspective, while highlighting and sometimes amplifying various human flaws through technology. Another theme involves a kind of revolutionary counter-culture fixating around the cult figure of ""The Laughing Man,"" a seemingly ingenious hacker whose apparent crimes in the past may or may not have spawned independent imitators for common causes - the ""Stand Alone Complex."" The show's writers seem to be well versed in alternative or counter-cultural ideas - the Laughing Man frequently appears in the guise of a rotating smiley-face icon quoting from J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye,"" while the name ""The Laughing Man"" itself is from one of Salinger's short stories.
The quality of the artwork varies by the episode - there isn't one unifying art style as in other anime series. That said, the animation is generally quite good, with a generous mix of 3D graphics blended with the 2D characters. Likewise the music direction and composition is amply offered in the varied and frequently eclectic style of Yoko Kanno, and resembles her mix in Macross Plus and Cowboy Bebop. Frequently the combination of art, music, and plot mesh quite well. Viewers may question Kusanagi's dress code, the quick bouts of graphical violence, or the complete lack of action - this show is definitely not for children.
The Special Edition DVD set features 3 DVDs: the first features the first four episodes with extras, the second features the first four episodes with DTS sound (and extras), and the third features the original soundtrack for the first season. Only the first disc is featured with the regular set.
Here is an episode summary:
SECTION 9: The series is introduced after a short encounter with a rooftop criminal as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and party is suddenly held hostage in a robot geisha house. Aramaki quickly takes control with Section 9, but nothing about the hostage situation, the aftermath, or the army's involvement is as it seems. The entire team is introduced, some albeit briefly, as is Aramaki's long-time friend Kubota. The plot generally isn't too complex and is easy to figure, but it's a good start.
TESTATION: At the Kenbishi Heavy Industry's Maneuvers Dome the company's new heavy multi-legged sentient AI tank seemingly goes berserk, blasts itself out of the Dome, and gets on the highway - but where is it going? And why? It's Section 9's job to follow and if possible stop the tank, while discovering why it went berserk. This episode really introduces the Tachikomas and involves one of the most sentimental and nearly tearful stories in the entire season. It's interesting how the direction focuses on the cyborgs of Section 9 as Togusa details how Kago wanted something similar for himself and could never get in life.
ANDROID AND I: Old-style ""Jerry""-type androids begin self-destructing in spectacular ways en masse, bringing Section 9 into the case, fearing a connection to an earlier case in the capital. While the case doesn't seem as vicious, the investigation quickly brings Batou and Togusa to the apartment of the perpetrator - a film-buff apparently in love with his android. Reportedly one of the show creator's favorite episodes.
INTERCEPTOR: The fourth episode begins the main story arc with the Laughing Man case as a police investigator on the case and acquaintance of Togusa is killed before he can tell Togusa something about the investigation - not with the case itself but something going on at higher levels of the investigation and the special investigation branch formed to solve the case. Before long Togusa discovers the illegal use of interceptors - microscopic cameras implanted on the surface of the eye - on the team itself. A scandal unfolds, and before long the Laughing Man himself makes an ""appearance.""
Honestly the first set should have the next two episodes as well as they are all linked but nevertheless these four show a fairly impressive range of what Stand Alone Complex is all about. Highly recommended.",1087516800,30,5903,5.182198952879581
2062471,5,B00024I18W,Awesome show.  Very mysterious very cool bad guy the Laughing Man.  Beautifully animated.  The music is some of the best of any anime or any tvshow/movie.  Very cool characters.  Very cool futuristic setting that doesn't seem to far away from where we are today.  I have been dying to see the english dubb of this cus its a very technical show and the subs scroll quite fast many times.  Yes I WILL own this show!,1087171200,2,413,4.426666666666667
2062472,5,B00024I18W,"If u have seen Ghost in the shell The Movie, u'll really be suprised with the first Season of Stand alone Complex!
This is a must have for any Shirow Fan and if u are not u will be after u have seen this!
Stunning Animations and action all the way being very close this time with the Original Manga!
When I saw the Fansub for the first time I thougt wow, if every anime would be like this I could die for it!
I hope it will be not to long for the second Season to come to DVD too. Because it's even darker with Major Motoko Kusanagi and her team involved in even more Black Ops action!
But get the First Season first!!! I do :)",1085529600,2,627,3.90625
2062473,5,B00024I18W,"This is undoubtfully the most interesting and unique series (not just anime but ANY TV series) I have ever seen, and I am almost positive you will have strong feelings for such a show like most feel for the Sopranos or CSI. I know that reviews are opinion based but if you knew how I stereotype cartoons you would find it hard to believe I would even consider watching this in the first place. Watching this series will definitly leave you thinking, it will leave you on the edge of your seat and, most of all, satisfied. For all of you fans of the original GITS, hesistating to purchase this series would be a mistake, and for the rest, borrow it from a friend, buy it yourself, either way you will be quite impressed. Awesome visual, plot and soundtrack, and definitly worth the money.",1085443200,4,787,4.472222222222222
2062474,5,B00024I18W,"I'm amazed at how many people actually think the movie is better than the series. This is by far the best representation of Ghost In The Shell. Its feel and content match then go deeper into the characters and plotlines in the TRUEST form of the original manga.

Anyone who thinks that the move is the best version never read the manga. The movie is a personal take on things from its director instead of following the style and characterisations from the manga , which in a way was a shame but it creates its own style. This always happens when something is adapted from its original form to andother, except in S.A.C. where they actually captured the feel of the manga, much to my surprise.

Read the manga, watch GITS SAC and 2nd Gig and ignore the movie and yu'll have a better experience with Ghost In The Shell than the movie alone can provide. Real GITS pureists have read the manga and will make th conection the the new material matches Shirow's vision.

All you have to do is pay shipping. It isn't hard.,1141344000,6,418,3.9761904761904763
2062476,5,B00024I18W,"I've never read the Ghost in the Shell comic series, but I love this show. Everything about it is top-notch, and at times you'll forget that you're not watching a major motion picture! The animation here is the most beautiful I've seen in a Japanese TV show (or any animated show, for that matter), and it's even better looking than many popular Anime movies! It's a genuinely sucsessful marraige of technology and good-old-fashioned human talent, which is poetic justice considering the show's premise.

The show very wisely follows a ""mini-movie"" episodic format with story-arch episodes scattered in between, which helps make it fairly accessable without loosing depth. You've probably already read the premise by now, so I won't bother re-capping. While some episodes did leave me scratching my head at times, it's still not too advanced if even just a casual Anime viewer like myself can sit down and enjoy it. It's a pretty good balance between depth and accessability, but it definately leans more towards depth. The important characters all get a good share of developement as well, which will certainly keep faithful viewers happy, and interested in more than just the next plot twist.

One piece of advice though: if you are interested in this show, stay AWAY from the 1996 Ghost in the Shell movie. I rented it after seeing dozens of over-bloated praises for it, and so I'll say this right here: whatever good you can find in the movie, the show does 10x better, and the rest is just headache-inducing crap. Plus the movie and show are not connected, so don't bother if you're thinking it will enhance your viewing expirience. I know I will get some hate for saying this, but it must be said.

My only true gripe with this show is that there is not an affordable or convinient way to own it. I would most certainly love to add it to my collection, but for a tally of roughly $150 per season, I am stuck living without. Hopefully we'll get a more reasonable deal later down the road, and maybe even a Blu-Ray disc set from the original high-definition master copies. For now though, my only option is watching it on Cartoon Network every week.",1140220800,6,2153,4.751336898395722
2062477,2,B00024I18W,"I stopped watching this after the first episode. The Animation is nothing like the movie GITS. Also there is quite a bit of cgi used  in the series. The music was nothing like the original and the actors who did the english dub sounded corny to me. The only similarity between this and the movie is the premise and plot. All of the atmospherics are gone. There are numerous still shots where only the mouth moves. This is a very tame and uncreative version of  ghost in the shell. All in all if your a die hard fan, I guess you will like this no matter what. If you expect a lot as I did you will be diappointed.",1135814400,7,612,4.1344537815126055
2062478,5,B00024I18W,"I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell.

I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it.

What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date.

Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called ""Niihama-shi"" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply ""Section 9"". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as ""The Laughing Man"".

Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs.

If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as ""tanks"" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere.

I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places.

if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is.",1132876800,9,3956,4.8088235294117645
2062479,5,B00024I18W,"From the mind of famed Japanese artist Masamune Shirow and his hit feature film Ghost in The Shell comes an excellent sci-fi series continuing the lives of those in Section 9.  Major Motoko Kusanagi and her crew of special agents come back for 26 episodes, the first volume containing the first four episodes of the series.  The series has great animation, including some excellent CGing that blends in well with the futuristic themes.  The dvd has animated menus and extras such as an interview with the Japanese voice actress of Kusanagi and an interview with the director.  The dvd also includes English and Japanese language settings with English subtitles.  A great series for any sci-fi, anime, or GiTS fan!",1126224000,,713,4.957983193277311
2062480,4,B00024I18W,"The year is 2030 and the ""real"" world has become increasingly confused with the world wide net. Some humans have taken on prosthetic bodies giving them greater access to the cybernetic world plus greater physical strength and speed. Need a new body? Just transfer your brain case to a new one! Major Motoko Kusanagi, one of the top agents of Section 9 (a anti-cyber terrorist task force), is one such cyborg. Her organization will have to deal with murderous robot geishas, a runaway tank, sex-slave suicides, and the reappearance of the infamous ""Laughing Man"", a legendary cyber-terrorist who once blackmailed some of the largest companies in the world.

Ghost in the Shell SAC takes place in the same world as the first Ghost movie but does not fit within its continuity. The animation here is first rate, with subtle shadows, hair motion, and fast moving action. There are no motionless painted scenes to be found here.

2062481,5,B00024I18W,"like any series some episodes are better than others.  yet overall the series as a whole's writing so far is an absolute masterpiece.  it is far more challenging than any fictional writing TV has ever done (airs on Adult Swim Cartoon Network) - and that includes dramas, sitcoms, sci-fi, comedy, anything.  it's also even superior than the original movie (which is my favorite movie), mainly because the story is stretched over many episodes, making it richer and deeper.

The DTS DVD disc has a glitch in which the left rear surround of the Japanese DTS audio is nearly inexistent.

Don't let this stop you from buying the Special Edition though. You can get the OST CD and DTS DVD replaced with corrected ones from Bandai Entertainment directly. They even send a check to reimburse postage.",1115856000,2,548,4.415841584158416
2062483,5,B00024I18W,"It took about three minutes of viewing Disc 1 before my wife and I blurted out simultaneously, ""We're buying the whole series.""

Imagine the world of Blade Runner, except the sun shines, the colors are bright, and there's none of the pervasive ""film noir"" mist. There bright lines between the living and the non-living are blurred by the power of cybernetics, and there seem to be few moral forces left in the world: except, most notably, for the powerful dedication to justice of the team that is Section 9.

Others have summarized the universe quite nicely, but I must join them in praising the soundtrack (which is especially lush in 5.1), another tour de force in a long history of Kanno's tours de force. The opening song is in Russian, English, and faux Latin--how DOES she think of these things? The characters, for all the brutality of their world and their work, have a compelling tenderness...when they're not blowing things up, that is.

Although this is not an ""adult"" anime by any means, it's certainly for more mature viewers. There's a lot of harsh and naked brutality, and cybernetic creatures tend to meet their end in particularly nasty and disturbing ways. The Major, one of the greatest anime characters ever created, seems to be costumed most often in either laquer or latex, and she appears to be ever at the point of bursting the surly bonds of her skimpy costume; her bodacious curves are often the target of convenient camera angles and rather personal closeups. However, I've yet to see any wardrobe malfunctions.

The English dub is surprisingly OK, all things considered. Aramaki, the chief of Section 9, is much scarier in Japanese, without any of the ""charming grandfather"" that he has in English. The supporting characters are basically well executed, and thankfully, the Major in English is done quite superbly; but her range in Japanese is wider, creating a greater contrast between her (few) gentle moments and the terrifying brutality of which she's clearly capable.

Recommended (for those old enough to handle the violence) unconditionally!",1112572800,,2077,4.991329479768786
2062484,4,B00024I18W,"I would agree with most of the nice comments said about the series itself. This is a wonderful series for all us cyberpunks who were disappointed with Bubblegum Crisis 2040. That being said, there are some technical issues with the first two DVDs with terms of motion artifacts that are quire frequent and noticible. This will obviously not affect watching it on a computer or a progressive scan tv and dvd player. I just with that Manga wasn in charge if the encoding overseeing as their reputation isn't exactly one of quality (Perfect Blue and Royal Space Force are great examples of this). Again, if you watch it on progressive scan then you have nothing to worry about, the sound is beautiful and the art is very stylish. Don't worry about the whole series, Disc 3 didn't appear to have this problem as Bandai reacted to the consumer complaints smoothed out many of the artifacts from Disc 3 on.",1111622400,3,900,4.666666666666667
2062485,5,B00024I18W,"Ghost in the Shell was one of my first exposures to Japanese feature length anime. It was at its time a superb technical and artistic achievement, and still is today, despite the number o anime series that have borrowed from it. Now a new venture brings the same contest to the more intimate television experience. And once again the durability of the plot and ideas are demonstrated to a new audience.

The context is a time not far in our future when heavy cybernetic modifications of the human body are possible. For some this has gone to the point of using a totally artificial both with an implanted human brain (the ghost) and it's associated quirks and personality. The star of this series is one such, Major Moto Kusanagi, both beautiful and deadly. She is a lead investigator in Section 9, a special police branch headed by Chief Aramaki. Her and her team are often brought in when a case involves national security and the intermixing of cybernetic and human consciousness. For the fans of the original film and the manga, the whole crew is present - Batou, Togusa, and the ever-present Tachikoma robots.

The continuity between this series and its origins is excellent - although Kusanagi has a habit of being even less dressed than she appears in the film. The world of the series has been updated a bit to cover for the change in public awareness of digital possibilities. The premise for this is that the events leading up to Kusanagi's transformation into a creature of the net simply didn't happen. Director and writer Kenji Kimiyama has set out to create a slightly more down to earth story with more components of a police procedural than deep philosophical moments. Although the issues of what is human and what is not still continue to haunt the stories it not longer dominates.

The four episodes on this disk cover a police cover up about a hacker incident, a military cyber-tank that suddenly develops an alarming amount of intelligence, a unique form of bait-and-switch in a geisha house, and a series of suicides by beautiful but obsolete androids. Each story manages to explore the tension at the human machine interface, revealing a sometimes chilling vision of the human and AI experience of a world traveling at Internet speed.

Of note is that the music for the series is by Yoko Kanno, one of Japan's most significant composers for the film. She has been responsible for Cowboy Bebop, RahXephon, Escaflowne, Wolf's Rain, and a host of other successes. Ghost in the Shell is another proof of her skill at matching music to concept. Put this whole effort down as a must of Ghost in the Shell fans.

The base DVD includes two excellent interviews. One is with director Kenji Kimiyama that reveals a lot of his intentions in the series. The second is with Atsuko Tanaka who is the Japanese voice actress for Major Kusanagi. It is a shame that the US audience is often totally unaware of the real dramatic forces brought into play by the original cast, but goes along with dubbing that is often too flat and poorly translated. Tanaka is a force of her own, and the listener should at least take the time to listen to the Japanese with subtitles to get a sense of Kusanagi's intended voice.",1103500800,37,3215,4.713523131672598

2062487,5,B00024I18W,"""Stand Alone Complex"" (SAC) is a set of loosely connected episodes of the recently televised saga of ""Ghost in the Shell"" and focuses on Major Motoko Kusanagi, her boss Section Chief Aramaki, and her team of cybercops - Batoh, Tegusa, Ichikawa, and a burbly, bright blue set of Tachikoma robots, all of Section 9. Most episodes stand by themselves and tell a probably mysterious, certainly moody story about things that aren't real, but happened anyway somewhere in cyberspace, or maybe the whole thing is a parallel universe to our own. The sometimes quite sexy stories move fast, the plotting is intricate, and the animation first-rate. --- Yes, there's lots of action. Motoko bounds around looking gorgeous (especially in the opening credits); an older, tougher but deeply emotional Batoh befriends the Tachikoma robots; an idealistic hacker named The Laughing Man comes and goes whenever he wants; Tegusa, as hard-working and sincere as ever, infiltrates a facility for rehabilitating cyberchildren (who have plans of their own); Aramaki pulls off Byzantine intelligence coups against Section 9's old military, governmental, and big business enemies. It's all mixed together with moody music about being on lithium, songs in Russian, and - oh, yes, I almost forgot - a young Canadian who is love with his out-of-date android. But, in common with many Production IG films, like the Patlabor films or ""Blood, the Last Vampire,"" the plots always exist in a world of corrupt politicians, very nasty army officers, and assorted other crazies who inhabit not only the world of SAC but also our own. This mix of sophisticated realism, poignancy, and high-tech animated cyberthingies can be surprisingly moving. --- SAC doesn't center on deep philosophical questions, as the first and especially second ""Ghost in the Shell"" film did. Instead, those questions simply bubble around the edges of the daily business of being a cybercop with Section 9. If ""Innocence,"" the second film, made a point of philosophy, in SAC the Section 9 folks have too many strange crises to deal with to worry very much about philosophy. For example, when Batoh provides his favorite Tachikoma robot with high-grade natural oil, it promptly takes an unauthorized vacation and befriends a little girl who is looking for her lost dog. Somebody suggests that it reconstructed its AI operating system from information in the oil... as good a guess as anyone's. --- So we see the already very strange world of Section 9 in the forefront, with enough action to entertain anyone. But in the background is a far far stranger universe. Things are never what they seem. It's an endless and fascinating game of What Does That Mean? As a result, if you let yourself merge with the stories, ""Stand Alone Complex"" is riveting. And Motoko really is gorgeous.",1097798400,11,2816,5.097402597402597
2062488,1,B00024I18W,"I liked Ghost In The Shell, the movie version. But this Stand Alone Complex is nothing like the movie. What happened to the Puppet Master, in the movie version? I have to admit, Stand Alone Complex is visually stunning, but other than that, it's nothing to cheer about. If you want to see the real Ghost In The Shell, then see the movie version. This Stand Alone Complex just doesn't measure up!",1096502400,4,395,4.5
2062489,5,B00024I18W,"The issues concerning the internet these days may well be considered as precursors to GITS:SAC. Privacy, access, surveillance, information, internet morality, and humanity are all problems dealt with in ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", except that the implications and legal ramifications are well established and things of the past. You will be compelled to outgrow the technological adolescence of the present very quickly to deal with the maturity and depth of the world of GITS.

I've seen the entire series, and it is by far one of the best anime series I've seen. The original movie was quite revolutionary by itself, but I have to say that the creators, producers, and studio have outdone themselves by a long shot with this series. The original characters are all there, Major Kusanagi, Batou, Togusa, etc., with the addition of several others who provide support and round out Section 9, a futuristic FBI/CIA organization, as a unit. The series is very much like NYPD Blue, in that you get to know the characters and their cases quite well.

What's astonishing about the series is that the creators have provided an amazingly detailed premise: the world has gone COMPLETELY digital, and the world's population is now linked to the future version of the internet with implants to the point where the line between personality/self and this alternate space has blurred considerably. They then ask the mind-boggling question: what could possibly happen in this kind of world? They answer, of course, with half-hour case studies of cyber-crime, political intrigue, digital culture, and philosophical soul-searching.

Each episode is self-consistent and follows very stringently the physics upon which the series is based. By this I mean that this world has been constructed with a basic set of rules, and each episode tells a story based on these rules, but without bogging him/her down with details about the rules. Instead, the episodes tell their stories and the viewer is thus thrown in the proverbial deep end, inadvertently learning to read the fine print in between the storylines. The extrapolations, implications, and possibilities of such a world are explored to an incredible depth and detail that only anime can provide.

Of course, given the opportunity to explore, there are some episodes where the script becomes a bit too self-analytical, and that might detract the viewer from the storylines, but I think when you create such a world, you are somewhat obliged to delve into those issues.

Can a machine ever have a personality? If your ghost (read personality) can be hacked, how can you tell what is real and what isn't?

The move from bigscreen to smaller scale is apparent in scope, but these short collections from the world of Ghost in the Shell are pretty good on their own.  Particularly compelling in this one is the story of a designer who puts his mind into a renegade mecha tank and then uses it to head out to meet up with his parents regardless of hardware in his way.  The android story reminded me of Cherry 2000; but despite the derivate episode I was pleased with the calibre of artwork and voice acting for the dub.  There are four episodes with the fourth being a cliffhanger to bridge to the next volume to be released at the end of Sept.  One thing I did notice was that the major in these short stories is played with a bit more emotion than the movie, less melancholia and soul searching.  Recommended.",1094601600,3,875,4.4375
2062492,5,B00024I18W,"I have the standard edition, with the first four episodes (out of the total of 26), the interview with the director, Kenji Kamiyama, and the interview with Atsuko Tanaka, the Japanese voice of Motoko.  Let me say, right off the bat, that I am a fan of Shirow Masamune's work, both the manga and the anime based on the manga, so I was happy to get this DVD.
The graphics and artwork, both 2-D and 3-D, is great.  Please remember that this is NOT a movie, but a full 26 episode series based on the manga.  So, there is no Pupper Master, but who cares?  The world of Ghost In The Shell is a GOLD mine of details - it could give the artists plots and ideas for ten times that many episodes.  Mysteries, conspiracies, questions of the very meaning of life is within the manga.  As long as the team making the anime keep to the nature and setting of the manga I don't think they could go wrong.
Love the Tachikomas.  They look stream-lined, fast and very real looking.  They sometimes act silly and have voices, by Sandy Fox, that might be a tad TOO cute for military craft, but I LIKE some humor in a show.  110 minutes total, suggested for 13 and up (gore and violence).
Motoko Kusanagi looks good.  Not too young, like in the manga, not too old, like in the movie - kind of a nice, shapely, balance inbetween.
I noticed only one English voice I knew - Crispin Freeman - but they all did a great job.",1093824000,7,1396,4.233962264150944
2062493,4,B00024I18W,"First off, Oshii had nothing to do with Season One of Ghost in the Shell:Stand Alone Complex TV.

  What Kamiyama and Production IG did for Shirow's work Ghost in the Shell is simply amazing.  They should be lauded for some really good writing and excellent computer animation.

  I can not recommend this series enough for those who truly love good science fiction, get it; even with the flaws that Bandai and Manga let in.

  First off, we get two DVDs with four episodes plus Tachikoma specials.  Each DVD has same main content, just the audio is different.  First DVD has DTS sound and Dolby, both English and Japanese as listed on the box cover.  However my copy of Disc 1 only had DTS English, DTS Japanese, and Dolby English.  Overall the dubbing of the English is good and tracks with the subtitles until one gets to the Tachikoma episodes where the English dub starts to really add words in comparison to the subtitles.  Not sure why that happened.  I will not comment on the goofs being reported on the included CD, since have the first GitS:SAC OST and Get 9 Japanese CDs did not check my copy.  I will accept the word of others here who report it has problems.  Hopefully Bandai and Manga will correct this and ship us replacements.

  Only minor quibbles I have is with the first episodes Bandai replacing the opening animation with the later episodes opening animation and redoing of the ending credits.  But I can live with it since does ot impact the story being told.

  Once again, go buy this DVD and get ready to have your ghost hacked in a most satisfying way.",1092960000,,1581,4.540925266903915

2062495,5,B00024I18W,"I'm not a fan of anime. In fact, I have an intense dislike for anime series such as Wolf's Rain and InuYasha. However, this anime is incredibly well done. Much like the movie, Ghost in the Shell, it is ""groundbreaking"" in many ways. Compared to the movie it is based off of, it's even better than the movie, although still using many of the movie's plotlines and ideas to completely unfold them towards a totally different angle.

The animation itself is beautifully drawn and fluid; the creators even go so far as to integrate three-dimensional graphics into the show (I.E. The tachikomas), and while you would think it wouldn't fit in too well, it actually does. They refine the animation enough that the 3D graphics work out very well, and give you something different to look at.

The storyline itself is fairly unique (At least that I know of) and very captivating; the only downside is that it's a bit hard to follow at times, but usually it ends up panning out. Excellent series.",1092700800,,986,4.660919540229885
2062496,5,B00024I18W,"After watching both Japanese and English dub, I found that I don't like English dub. I can't feel Motoko's good attitude from her English voice. I believe she is doing better job than GITS movie, but she still need more improvement of voice acting to catch the original attitude.  However, I like one scene which is the very last part of Episode 2 (Motoko is commenting about the moment of feeling when she burnt Kago's brain.) Otherwise, I don't like English dub. If you don't mind to see subtitles, I truly recommend to see SAC with Japanese sound. Since I'm native Japanese and English is my second language, I think their translation job is very good. (That's why my English has some flaw...)

To consider that SAC has been created for TV, this is one of the top quality anime in the history. Every scene doesn't contain any futile or extra one. Since many anime has been created (or tends to be) as easy to understand, SAC is totally opposit. You have to find the hint to understand the whole serise.

By the way, some people commented that you should buy DVD box, which comes with 4 discs... this is not an authentic and doesn't respect copy right!  The original (I mean, the official DVD sold in Japan) SAC costs almost $60 for ONLY 2 episodes. Since I paid almost same price of this DVD for SAC's sound track in Japan, I don't think this limited edition's pricing is ripping off. I just wish Bandai Ent. don't make same mistake for the next one. (""Be Human"" is really really good sound track, too! I even cried when I listen the first song, ""Be Human"".)",1091664000,3,1561,4.485915492957746

There's 30 eps in the first season and the second season is running in Japan now. I have to echo another comment here: the English dubs are not all they should be. I just went in, switched the audio to Japanese and turned on the subtitles. I heard the voices I am familiar with and got to compare the translation with the job done by Laughing Man Fansubs. The philosophical material in this series is not groundshakingly original, but the quality of execution is great. I have found very little that Production IG has done to be disappointing. The Yoko Kanno soundtrack is fantastic and will make you a fan of Origa, an ethnic Russian performer in Japan as well. I am just waiting for a US release of 'Innocence'. It just hit release on DVD in Japan. My only misgiving about it is that they did not use Yoko Kanno for the music.

If you like TV that doesn't treat you like moron, women as helpless, and enjoy action, this is some of the best video ever made.",1091664000,7,1109,4.331730769230769
2062498,5,B00024I18W,"Same characters as the movie, yet completly different storyline. If you're looking for a continuation of the movie than you need to change your mindset or you'll be dissapointed.

 Ghost in the Shell is a gorgeous series, with fantastic music, great storyline and characters. The first few episodes are mostly stand alone, however the last episode is a cliff hanger that leaves you drooling for more. While the majority of epsiodes can be watched in any order, its a great way for the viewer to be emersed in the world of Ghost in the Shell, and to get an idea of how things are. There are a few character background hints dropped here and there but nothing major.

 Yoko Kanno is the composer of the music, and anybody who knows her just knows how wonderful her soundtracks are. Ghost in the Shell takes more of the techno/rock route, but it also has a hint of Arjuna's etheral feel.

 The animation is for the most part top notch and the character design stay true to Masume's original designs. The opening theme song is beautiful in music and animation, one that I didn't skip over at all when moving from episode to episode.

 One last little charm of this series is the Tachimako Days at the end of each epsiode. Some people find them annoying, but I find them absolutely adorable. Its just a little short that takes place of an ""Next Episode"" preview, where the tachimakos[a form of tank] do a little skit, talking in their cute high pitched voices, in some form that pertains to the episode we just watched.

 The extras are good for the most part, with an interview with the Japanese voice actress of the Major, and the director I believe. Its a nice change of pace considering majority of the time you get the English voice actors. I'm sorry, I'm a subtitled preferror so that always annoyed me when I got that extra. I find a bit more of a difference in how the Japanese seiyuu approach the job of voice over than English voice actors. But that's just me.

 I haven't watched any of it in English, and probably won't, so I can't really comment on that.

 Overall this series is one to be watched as soon as possible. I really like where they're going with this, and everything that goes along with this show.",1091491200,7,2218,4.5125

I watched the first two episodes, and really like the series. The characters seem very three-dimensional, and hopefully will be fleshed out over the course of the series. The action is fast and furious, and the animation quality is spectacular. It feels like feature-quality. And that theme song- written by Kanno, sung by Russian/Japanese artist Origa, the song is... astounding, like Enya, but really good! I'm happy to say the same song is on the CD. As for the supposed DTS issues, the sound was perfect, and I checked both English and Japanese soundtracks.

2062501,4,B00024I18W,"The ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" (Vol. 1) Limited Edition comes as a DVD clamshell case and a CD held together by a vertically-oriented glossy paper slipcase. The DVD clamshell has an extra tray inside to hold the second DVD with the DTS versions of the episodes. The extra video content is only published on the regular DVD; the DTS DVD contains just the episodes and credits, and it is marked with the DTS logo and a completely different picture on the disc. Some DVD releases of the Japanese version ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" included horizontally-oriented plastic slipcases that were meant to hold several DVD clamshells. Do no mistake that for what is provided with the United States version of ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" (Vol. 1) Limited Edition. When I received my copy, the slipcase (with discs inside) was double wrapped in plastic. The shrinkwrap plastic was so tight that it crushed part of the slipcase in the back, in the area not occupied by the included CD. I mention this on behalf of those who might care about that sort of thing.

 By my perception the English audio tracks are a bit louder than the Japanese audio tracks. The English subtitles do not always match the English dialog spoken. Many lines of dialog appear to be different. I think the spoken dialog is better in content, but the delivery of the dialog by the English voice actors tends to vary in quality. Sometimes the English dialog is believable, and sometimes it is terrible, suggesting that it was recorded out of order before mastering. Some jokes in the dialog did not translate all that well either. But the sound effects are crisp and loud.

 The ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex (Vol. 1)"" Limited Edition comes with an audio CD, the Original Sound Track. If you are a hardcore fan of the series, then you probably already purchased the ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" OST when it came out in Japan on 2003/01/22. The United States version of the OST actually has two additional tracks, one of which is the opening theme from the second season of ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" (known officially as ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig""). These extra tracks are the shorter versions used in broadcast, and thus not equivalent to the longer versions available in the ""Ghost in The Shell:Stand Alone Complex - GET9"" CD Maxi-single (VICL-35603) that was released in Japan on 2004/01/21.

 As posted by another reviewer to Amazon for the ""Ghost in the Shell - Stand Alone Complex"" (Vol. 1) Limited Edition, the CD was manufactured with an incorrect track index. Tracks 8 - 12 are mis-indexed for the included audio content. I also think that the entirety of the song 'Fish ~ Silent Cruise' is not on the CD, but rather, a shorter version.

 The audio CD packaging shows that distribution was handled by Bandai Entertainment. If you wish to voice your dissatisfaction with the defective indexing of the CD tracks, I suggest contacting Bandai Entertainment first before trying to contact Manga Entertainment. I would have provided the mailing address, email address, and web site for Bandai Entertainment customer service in this review, but Amazon.com forbids this in the Amazon Review Writing Guidelines.

2062502,4,B00024I18W,"I am a huge fan of the Ghost in the Shell (GITS) franchise. The original manga was outstanding and I love the feature length movie. When I first heard about Stand Alone Complex (SAC) I could not have been more thrilled. The following is a review of the show and this DVD package.

The Show: This is by far one of the best Anime series I have seen this year. After watching the full series in Japanese, I can confidently say that Production IG has done the fans a true service. Rooted more in the original manga than the film, SAC provides a host of exciting episodes full of action, emotion, philosophy and humor. In addition, we get to see more of the lesser known characters that were not as prominent in the film, or in some cases, not in the film at all. For example, the entire Section 9 team is present, including the beloved Tachikomas. If you have limited exposure to GITS, I recommend you first purchase the original manga, read it cover-to-cover, then go out and watch this DVD. It will make the initial fewing much more enjoyable. Overall, this is a fantastic series that will appeal to any fan of quality, edgy science fiction.

The DVD: And now for the bad news. Overall, the production of this DVD is fairly dissapointing. The voice work by the English actors is just bad. While some of the original cast utilized for the movie has returned (such as Batou and Arimaki), the woman hired to voice Major Kusanagi is the worst voice actor I have ever heard. She literally ruins the entire show and forces me to listen to the program in Japanese while reading the english subtitles. Furthermore, the menu system is stale and boring. I know this is really nitpicky subject, but if I have to shell out this much cash, I want to see quality oozing out of each and every pore of this product. The cd soundtrack helps to make up for the faults as it is more wonderful music from Yoko Kanno (of Cowboy Bebop and many other great shows). In the end, though, I have to agree with another reviewer: go buy the Japanese import of this show. It's cheaper across the board and the voice acting (while in a foreign language) doesn't suck!",1091145600,6,2134,4.455242966751918
2062503,4,B00024I18W,"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is by far one of the best series I've ever seen in my life (anime or otherwise). The Region 1 done by Bandai/Manga is also one of the worst I've seen in my life. On the plus side, the HD quality and DTS sound (in the Japanese language track), is top notch. I can't really complain about the intro starting off with the CG intro, as was done on the R2 (Japan) release. [BTW, the review above said it was on 2 of the eps, wrong. The animated intro was a temporary replacement for episodes one and two until completed. This tradition was carried into GITS:SAC Gig2 for the TV premiere).

 The DUB: I hate dubs to start with, very few are worth any attention to start with. This is, however the worst I've heard in awhile. The voice actress playing Motoko can't even pronounce ""Tachikoma,"" let alone sound even 1/4 as intelligent as the character of Motoko is. Batou has been horribly humiliated, and the Chief... Kirika Yuumura can kill me right now. Horrible. Now moving on...

 The SUB: I'm not fluent in Japanese, but I sure wish I was, then I wouldn't have to put up with this crap. The translations don't seem to be too off base from the little bit I know, and is probably one of the better translations of R1 releases out there. However, whoever had the brilliant idea to put them 1/4 up the screen right in the middle of all the animation, action, even in characters faces needs to be shot. It's so bloody annoying it's better to just leave them off and guess what they say half the time, because you sure won't be able to stand the DUB.

 The Menu: What can I say, it's the best Manga had done. That's not saying much. They had the general concept and idea right... they just need a team that knows what they are doing to properly execute it. A+ for effort, C- for execution.

 Overall: GITS:SAC is, once again, one of the best shows I've ever seen. However I'm not going to be able in good conscious pay Bandai/Manga anything further for their crap. I think I'll be looking into R2 imports for the rest.",1091145600,4,2049,4.359580052493438

During track 8, both track 8 and 9 merge into one track, so if you play ""track 9"" you are actually hearing track 10. This throws off the timing for the rest of the songs after track 8. The music quality is excellent, but only the track numbering is off during CD playback. I am sure Bandai will release a fix for this ASAP.",1091145600,,484,4.0
2062505,2,B00024I18W,"Where do I start? I am a fan and a long time admirer of Ghost in the shell Stand Alone Complex the First gig. I was a littlie ticked off that the same computer intro was used for all four episodes because the Japanese version only has two episodes with the computer generated intro out of the 26 total. For the Manga purist your missing out on the kick @$$ animated into! I bought this version because I wanted to see and hear the translations of the dialog and the text that is seen in the series. But once again Manga has screwed the poodle! They will release the series on seven or eight DVD's and milk the fans! BUY THE BOX SET IMPORT for $39.00 on four DVD's.

  I have seen all 26 episodes of the series in its original format on DVD from Japan. I was utterly disappointed in Manga entertainments treatment of the material. This is by far no bargain I watched both Japanese and the American versions back-to-back they are basically the same but Manga's version has been cut down to only four episodes a DVD as apposed to 26 episodes on four DVD's on the Japanese box set. I was to say the least disappointed with this DVD. In my humble opinion you are better off getting the four box DVD set as an import with region one encoding. I am happy I got this DVD for the translations but am warned if you think that they did not change the voice actors, they did! Some of the same voice actors are back to revise there English speaking parts but some of them are not. For the person who likes the same voice actors be warned!

  On the Plus side you do get the second OST from Yoko Konno which is one of her best CD's next to Cowboy bebop's OST! I am happy I have another copy of this CD one for the car and one for the stereo this is buy far one of her best! But don't buy this box set just for the sound track, buy it separately!

  Over all Manga did a poor job by cutting this series up into seven DVD's! Wait till it comes out in a box set!",1090972800,9,1945,4.083989501312336
2062506,4,B00024I18W,"I'm a huge fan of the original Ghost In The Shell movie, and when I heard that there was a tv series, I became very excited.  So, I'll grant that my expectations may have been a bit high.  I recently picked up and read the graphic novel collection of the original manga, and had liked that quite a bit.  Overall, I have to say, I like Standalone Complex.  However, there are some downsides.

As others have noted, it doesn't seem to be quite as cinematographic, or stylized.  The animation is still good, but it doesn't have that same mind-blowing quality that the movie had, at least for me.  And the voices were a bit of an adjustment, having gotten used to the movie's voice actors... but that's really not that big a deal overall.  The biggest complaint I have is the tachikomas.  I think they're kind of stupid.  I thought the same thing about them in the comic, they just don't fit the overall seriousness of the plot.  They strike me as kind of like a kid sidekick in a superhero comic.  Sometimes that might work, but it just doesn't work (for me) in this series.  Fortunately, they're not in all episodes, but there is an annoying coda at the end of each with the tachikomas featured.  They remind me of pokemon characters... which isn't bad, for pokemon, but just doesn't work in Ghost, at least in my opinion.  The tachikomas should have stayed on the cutting room floor.  They look kewl, but they sound stupid.

Oh, well... overall, the 1st volume is good, but not that meaty yet.  The episode count seems low, and personally I'm not sure I'll continue buying these limited editions.  They're a bit pricey for what you get... I haven't really listened to the CD yet, but the overall soundtrack of the show hasn't been anything that special yet (compared to a show like Serial Experiments Lain), so I'm considering moving to the standard editions going forward...",1090972800,5,1874,4.590361445783133

Sorry, back on topic. This anime not only delivers mind blowing graphics, but it brings back the questions of our minds and souls that the movie asked us. Be prepared to re-enter the world of Ghost in the Shell, but with different character designs (which are better in my opinion). Major Matoko Kusanagi is not only just as bad ass as before, but her design isn't as manly as in the movie. Batou now has longer hair, pulled back, and Togusa also looks better. The anime introduces new characters, including the Tachikoma, an intelligent mechanical being that have ""cute"" children voices that are in complete contrast to their mechanical features that would other-wise seem scary. This series really has nothing to do with the movie, since the movie didn't follow the manga and was pretty much made up outside the manga. The story has a great plot! They are tracking down the ""laughing man"", whose symbol is a smiley face with a hat and surrounded by the phrase ""I thought what I'd do was pretend to be one of those deaf-mutes"". I don't want to tell too much and spoil anything. I was amazed with all of it, and completely tranced! I've recently started watching the second season, and I'm already taken away with it as well!

2062510,5,B00024I18W,"I just bought this movie today so I figured I would write down a review for it. Here you go.

  Let me start out by saying this is a spectacular anime. I have been a huge fan of the gundam series ( even though I have watched muiltiple anime's ) which was my favorite series, until now. The animation is top notch, even though sometimes between frames it makes a distortion appearence ( though it could be my tv/dvd player ) but I am not sure if everyone will experience it.

Along with the animation the sound is perfect. With the same composer as wolf's rain, and C. Bebop it is kinda implied that it is great. On the internet this series was bashed for not developing the characters. I will admit this is true, but it doesn't effect the series at all, because the plot's are so amazing that the characters just fall right into place and prove their strenghs and weakness's perfectly. You will also appreciate the action sequences. Right from the beginning the there is a gory action scene that will dazzle you mind.

  The only cons I could come up with is that you have to watch it a couple times because a lot of info is tossed at you, And some of the voice overs do not fit the role.

  But minor flaws aside this is a great series that I look forward to seeing the rest of the series. Do Not hesitate buy this Now, you will not be sorry!",1090886400,,1343,4.2109375
2062511,5,B00024I18W,"For those of you who like the manga and the movie you will love this series.  It is based off the manga and supposedly it is before the movie happened.  For me I don't think so, there is a reason I believe why it is called Stand Alone Complex.  Now the character design and the story is more from the manga.  So for those of you guys who liked the movie and that's all you know or like, you might not enjoy it right away.  This series is what the creator(Masamune Shirow)intended it to look like.  The movie is the change.  This is a 26 episode series so there are a lot of stories and situations to come.  I'm glad that finally they are also using DTS for the sound.  Many of the Korean animes are in DTS and it's so nice to hear it like that.  The only bad thing is that they are charging alot more and giving you the 5.1 disc as well(like you'd play it if you have DTS).  The soundtrack that comes with this is excellent, done by Yokko Kano, which is done by the same person who did Cowboy Bebop.  Her versatility amazes me.  My only complaint is the price as I do not think the next volumes will come anything extra like the soundtrack so you are paying the extra $10 dollars for the 5.1 disc which you don't care about when you buy the DTS vesion.",1087603200,10,1252,4.081967213114754

8022091,5,B00024I18W,"I fell in love with the ""Ghost in a Shell,"" a few years ago when I saw it on Adult Swim.  Since then I have been collecting the DVD's.  I have the Movie and now I'm up to Volume 4 in the ""Stand Alone,"" series.  Eventually I will have them all!  The story is intriguing as is the psychology of an android having a ""Ghost.""  I think it is written well and has kept me interested.",1261526400,,377,3.9078947368421053
8022092,5,B00024I18W,"I have to admit that I'm not much of an Anime fan, sure I was into it a couple of years ago but it quickly wore off and I'm not sure what made me check out this series besides it being online in the watch instantly section of Netflix.  Turns out I'm very glad I saw it, it my expectations for it's intellectual maturity that the original movie had shown and managed to--almost--not fall into any of the pits that annoy me most in the stereotypical anime I avoid.  The exception being those annoying Tachikomas who had such and interesting underlying story arc marred completely by their silly actions and little girl voices.

In the end, this is a very intellectually stimulating vision of what an internet driven future could become that challenges ideas on bioethics, identity, psychology, ethics of technology, justice, society, industrialization, corporate and government corruption.  Don't get me wrong, the depth of the philosophy isn't earth shattering but it's ultimately more interesting then the Matrix if not as powerful as Gattaca.

As a sci-fi fan I also found the show pretty exciting, the action is as good as any anime and much more serious and realistic then most and the visions of computers, the internet and military technology is surprisingly unique.  I'd definitely give the show a recommendation, even for a non-anime fan and I think in a lot of ways it may be easier to swallow even then the original movie.",1230336000,,1431,4.820408163265306
8022093,5,B00024I18W,"This is what you would expect from the team that makes this awsome film and series! Visuals are as always, Top notch in the anime world, with thought provoking story lines, that make it so you can't wait to watch the next episode in the series. If you like you anime like i do with realistic looking charaters, and just alaround good damn movie. you have to have this in your collection, along with the whole series!",1202428800,,416,4.415584415584416
8022094,4,B00024I18W,"I would rate the show as 5 stars, this is a review of the extras and features of the Special Edition issue.

I recently bought all the Special Edition releases of ""Stand Alone Complex"" after trying to research what I was going to get as extras not included in the regular edition. I found the listings on Amazon's product details to be a little confusing and incomplete on some of the volumes so I decided to write this guide for others trying to decide. I'm not going to review the ""Ghost in the Shell"" episodes or the series in general because  there are so many excellent reviews already on this site, and most of you probably know about this great anime TV series already. There are various other reviews that say that some of the DVD's and CD's have errors on them and Bandai will replace them with corrected discs if you send them in for exchange. I have not ran into problems yet, although I haven't gone through the whole series either. And I will also state that I love the TV series as well as both movies, but I would recommend the Imported Region 2 version of GITS2:Innocence if you have a region free DVD player. Dreamworks really messed up that release omiting the English dub and putting Hard of Hearing subtitles instead of regular ones on the early issues of that movie. Most people find them very distracting and annoying.

  First off the discs themselves, you get two DVD discs in each volume with the same episodes on both discs. Volumes 1-5 have 4 episodes each, 6 and 7 have 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total in the series. Both discs are Anamorphic wide screen encoded directly from the High-Definition Masters. Both Discs also have English subtitles. Each set also has two interviews with voice cast or someone associated with the production of the anime, and a printed DVD insert pamphlet or booklet with different interviews and such for each volume. All discs are Region 1.

Disc one has Dolby Digital 5.1 in Japanese and English, and Dolby Digital  2.0 in English and Japanese.

Disc two has DTS 5.1 in English and Japanese and a Dolby Digital 2.0 English track.

Volumes 1 and 2 include soundtrack CD's of the music of Yoko Kanno, the most excellent and versatile composer of the music in the TV series. Anime lovers know her work from the many fine soundtracks that she's done for countless other anime movies and TV series.

Volume 3 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Major Kusanagi graphic on the back. Nice shirt!

Volumes 4 and 5 have a collectable I.D. cards for a section 9 member.

Volume 6 has a Black XL Fruit of the Loom Tee-Shirt with the section 9 logo on the front and a Batou graphic on the back, and another I.D. card. Nice shirt again!

Volume 7 has another Tee-Shirt! This time it's a White XL with the section 9 logo on the front, and the Laughing Man logo on the back! Once again nice shirt!  It also comes with a tin box that's supposed to hold all 7 volumes of the DVD set. I was excited about getting the box but when it arrived I was disappointed with the design. It's kind of like the rectangular lunch box that you used to take to school as a kid, without the handle and latch.  Its also of a thinner metal that dents easily. It has marketing type of printing on the backside that pertains to vol. 7 only, and the DVD cases stack inside one on top of the other. The spines of the cases are not visible when you open the box, only the front of the last case you put in. So you have to take all the cases out of the tin to get to a specific volume.  There's also not room for the cardboard sleves that the DVD's were in when you got the individual volumes, and no room for the soundtrack CD's either. All said, I was disappointed with the box. Because of it's odd dimensions it doesn't stack in well with my DVD library. I would have much preferred the normal five sided box that usually comes with DVD sets.

  Overall I'd say it's worth it to buy volumes 3, 6 and 7 new to get the shirts if they interest you and pick up the others used if you can to save some money on the series. That is if you're interested in the DTS soundtrack options. I much prefer the DTS mixes to Dolby Digital and wanted the soundtrack CD's as well. Also the cardboard boxes that come with volumes 3 and 6 are better than the tin box to store your set in when you complete the series, if you stack them on shelves one row of DVD's on top of another row, and you can fit the movies into those boxes as well to fill them the rest of the way.",1159142400,12,4531,4.2907385697538105
