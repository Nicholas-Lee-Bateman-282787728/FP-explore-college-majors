7343963,5,B0128QB16A,Brilliant and fitting Ending to one of the all time Great tv series.  I've watched a lot of shows and there are very few that never disappoint Mad Men is one of them each and every Season consistently Great and I have to give credit to Matthew Weiner it's his show and his vision and he gave us 7 amazing Seasons of tv.

These are some of the greatest characters in TV history, and are developed so well by the writers and actors.  The way they evolve through the series is awesome to watch.

Set in the 60""s, Mad Men meaning Madison Avenue (NY) advertising exec's and the implied parallel to actual mad men. Anyway, the final season was an excellent way to close out this series and fans will enjoy how creatively this was handled.

I've never been so disappointed with a series ending, the way this one did, to the point that I am removing my entire DVD series collection of Mad Men off my shelves because they don't even deserve dust that will collect on them. Netflix this series and don't waste a DIME on buying the DVD/Blu Rays. I know, I know, some other comments sing the praises of this series. Honestly, for those who haven't seen this series, don't waste your time. I wish I could get those hours of binge watching back. I feel so manipulated and jerked around. Half of the episodes in Part Two are very confusing, choppy and incomplete.  I could care LESS about most of the characters that I was hoping that someone, like the artwork opening sequence suggests, would jump out the 27 floor conference window. But no one does.

7344035,5,B0128QB16A,"Im happy to share that I have previously had the chance to purchase part one of Mad Men Season 7.  Anyhow,Mad men season 7 part 2 opens with episode 8 Severance includes Don Draper (Jon Hamm) getting a major shock when he goes to meet a person from his past. Elements of his personal life catch up with him when he sits inside a restaurant.  There is then the issue of Ken Cosgrove who is forced out of his job but is offered a generous financial package. The one thing that I admit to enjoying about season 7 episode 8 is the element/message of how important it is to avoid underestimating a former employee who is forced out of an organization. I say this because even many of the well-meaning media articles cover how a person should try not to avoid burning bridges even if forced out but there is scarce information dealing with the other perspective of the employee, especially if they were the target of illegal bullying and/or illegal discrimination (related to their marital status and/or attractiveness level). I like that episode 8 of severance creatively touches on the viewpoint of the employee (which seems to be rare even in the 2000s time period). The characters of Joan and Peggy have to deal with unpleasant harassment when they try to do business with a group of other professionals that they have to do business with.  Jon Hamm, January Jones, Christina Hendricks, Vincent Kartheiser, Elisabeth Moss,John Slattery, Kiernan Shipka and more actor/actresses return for the second half of season 7 part 2.",1456790400,,1521,4.775665399239544

7344041,1,B0128QB16A,"This part 2 of the final season was a mess.  Especially with the ending segments.  It seems that everything that was happening needed a happy or sad conclusion.  There were some shocking gettogethers, and bizarre moments.

When I season ends,  it is best to have it simply end, with the viewer not knowing what happened.  But these last few episodes just rushed everything into a conclusion.  Let's have so and so do this,  or what about lets make so and so do this,  and  what about doing a finale on so and so.  Especially ridiculous was the Rizzo/Peggy thing at the end.  Totally absurd!

7344044,4,B0128QB16A,"As so many others have said, Mad Men is undoubtedly one of the best series ever produced for television.  The knowledge of the 1960's and early 1970's that is reflected in the show is remarkable.

The series had a break due to contract disputes, and the later seasons do not seem as strong as the earlier seasons.  That being said, the latter part of season 7 brings out qualities in Betty and Sally that are quite strong.

Similarly, the earlier death of Bert Cooper, and his dream sequence Busby Berkeley dance routine, was genius.

The disappointing thing is the ending.

Throughout the seven seasons, there were moment of brilliance, or insight, of understanding of the era and of the social norms.  Time after time the show came up with powerful images and dialogue.  There were all sorts of literary references and analogies to an Homeric Odyssey of the soul - often leading to the exactly correct choice of closing music.

This is a truly great series, and yet it ends in a moment that could hardly be more cheezy, or corny, or schlocky.  Every other character in the show is shown arriving at some moment of enlightenment - even the craven, selfish, and childish  Is this really the best you could do?  At the end of the last show of the last season, the writers run out of gas, and come up empty?  How totally unsatisfying.  This show deserved way, way better than that.

But for that terrible let-down of an ending, the show would merit 5 stars.",1455580800,2,1455,4.5852713178294575

7344053,2,B0128QB16A,"The show gets 5 stars, but the episode commentaries are what we Mad Men fans wanted most in buying this set, and I give that only 2 stars.  I'm  disappointed with the substance and quality of the commentaries that are included for each episode.  First of all - with the exception of Jon Hamm on the final episode, there are no actors commenting on any other episodes.  It's all Matt Weinter, plus writers, directors, and the costume designer - which would have been acceptable, if they had much to say that was interesting.  Matt Weiner's comments don't have much substance, which was a surprise.  Ironically, the writers and Weiner (who did some writing as well) keep saying ""Ummmm"" and ""Uhhhh"" AD NAUSEUM - they seldom speak with any eloquence.  And they giggle a LOT, often at things that aren't the least bit funny - to us, anyway.  It's as if a lot of things were inside jokes to them, but they don't elaborate , which gets really annoying after a while.  Scott Hornbacher was a commenter on The Milk and Honey Route, which he directed, and he spoke for perhaps one and a half minutes total(!) Another letdown - Janie Bryant, the show's much-lauded costume designer, makes superficial comments with little insight as to her thought processes which led to the costumes she designed.  But most disappointing of all was how much everyone on the commentary tracks - including Hamm - spent about as much time laughing and giggling at things as they did actually making comments.  The commentary - which was the big draw for me buying this set - was Amateur Hour.  The final episodes of Mad Men deserved better.",1453766400,7,1610,4.670212765957447

The Final Season: Part Two
(AMC, 2015)
------------------------------------------------------------
This conclusion to one of TV's finest dramas was heartbreaking and wonderful, a perfect reward for longtime viewers and so much better than many other show finales with similar expectations and demands from critics and loyal fans alike.  At the end of Part One, we saw our antihero Don Draper cement his position as a soulless success, a man driven to misbehave and constantly pushing away true emotional connection. As the American astronauts were landing on the moon, he seemed no less remote, his world equally desolate and devoid of life.

This ""season"" opens in a new decade, with Don and the Sterling-Cooper gang having made it into the '70s, and the world seemingly their oyster, as their rebranded agency is going like gangbusters. Don however, despite his bravado and wealth, is still a mess. He tries to connect, but keeps getting it wrong, driven by compulsions and self-loathing that have deepened and cratered -- in part, there's an urge to rescue people, like a grief-stricken waitress that he turns the old Draper charm on, but she's an even bigger mess than he is, and he can't use her to distract himself from himself. Don needs to deal with his demons, and since he has spectacularly failed in that task so many times and in such dramatic fashion before, a heavy aura of doom follows him from scene to scene, episode to episode.

Meanwhile, the other core characters are all coming to their life-defining moments as well -- things are swinging when the season opens, but we know that it can't last, and sure enough circumstances change, causing them each to pick a new path. Without going into details, I will say the writers were surprisingly generous and kind to the characters -- it's not a pollyanna-ish ending by any means, but it's a happy one for the most part, made bittersweet by all that comes before. Indeed, the last three episodes all end on notes that could have been worthy of a finale, but the story continues until we really know where everyone is headed. We ache for all the characters, and truly worry about Don, but we see the reasons for why things end as they do, and it feels real and right.

I'm sure I'm not alone in wishing that we could see more of these characters -- what will Peggy or Joan be doing in 1975?  And I suppose a sequel or sequels are always possible, but they may not be necessary. Regardless, we can always return to re-watch these seven seasons of some of the best, most intelligently written and beautifully realized television that this decade has produced.  And believe you me, I've already pulled out Season One to start all over again. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1444867200,5,2750,4.791139240506329

There were quite a few plot lines, and especially characters, that were not explored or (not explored deeply) that disappointed me- characters that simply ""disappeared"". I especially enjoyed watching Don's daughter grow up and her friendship with Glen (two great actors!). There were many characters I found particularly amusing and I really liked Jared Harris (an underrated actor) as the ever so slightly sleezy Lane Pryce. Though there were disappointments I'd still rate this series with the highest rating due to the high production qualities and attention to detail that only someone who grew up in the era, in that enviornment would notice or remember fondly. The one error I could find was that if you lived within 50 miles of NYC the antenna reception was very sharp, even with rabbit ears.

7344132,5,B0128QB16A,"It was superb. Almost all the plot lines were resolved not by telling you exactly what happens in the future, but by showing you enough info to draw a conclusion on your own. January Jones as Betty really gets to show her acting chops in some wonderful scenes with her daughter and in a wrenchingly sad phone conversation with Don. Betty was such a complex and underplayed character that she was often dismissed as a boring spoiled selfish woman. For many of us who grew up in that era with a bright but frustrated, desperately unhappy mother like Betty, I think the writers and Ms. Jones captured her profound sadness and the resulting sadness of her daughter beautifully.

8725670,4,B0128QB16A,"Ending a series thats as complex and engaging as Mad Men cannot be an easy task; finding a way to wrap up the various story sub plots and bringing closure to fans must be a challenge.  Some series do it well (think The Shield or Justified) and other not (such as Seinfeld or The Sopranos) but Matt Weiner & Co make a decent effort with these final seven episodes.  Things kick off with Don and Megan finalizing their divorce; vindictive mother-in-law Marie as Megans proxie has the movers clean out the penthouse and not just the few things Megan wanted to take; and Don sells the penthouse and isn't overly interested in finding another place.  Draper takes a romantic interest in a restaurant waitress who reminds him of a past paramour.  Shes damaged goods and definitely not the type you expect him to go for and I found this story line untrue to the character and more of a distraction than anything else.

  The unthinkable has happened and Sterling, Cooper & Partners has been absorbed by advertising giant McCann/Erickson leaving the team scrambling to adjust.  Abruptly moved out of their old Time Life Building headquarters and under the thumb of new masters leaves the SC&P execs struggling.  Roger won't leave the old building- hes rich but already nostalgic for what hes lost; Peggys still in her old office because  McCann  botched up her new office and she refuses to step foot in the building until they're ready for her.  Roger and Peggy have a surreal moment sharing a few drinks ending with Roger playing an electric organ while Peggy roller skates around the empty offices.

  Don Draper (the Emmy winning Jon Hamm) at first seems to be taking the changes well right up until the first creative meeting for a big client.  Used to being the star of the show he walks into a big conference room thats packed with people that looks like a party and reality hits home.  Sitting in the meeting you can see from the subtle expressions of his face hes not going to be able to work in this environment and sure enough he gets up and walks out and does not look back.  He jumps in his Caddy and heads west, initially trying to find Diana the waitress (why?), and when he fails he just keeps driving to the west coast.  Don gives his car away to a grifter and takes the bus to California where he ends up at a new age retreat.  Ultimately while meditating hes inspired with a vision thats turned into the famous 1970 Coca-Cola commercial with the international cast of young people singing Id Like to Teach the World to Sing.  Its an ambiguous ending to be certain but Matt Weiner in interviews said were to infer that Dons idea thats behind the award winning ad.  Not as satisfying an ending as it could be but more so than the conclusion to The Sopranos.  Hamm is excellent, he has some moving scenes speaking on the phone with ex-wife Betty and later with Peggy that highlight his acting skills.

  We also catch up with daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) who is briefly reunited with former creepy neighbor kid Glenn, now 18, flunking out of college and enlisting in the Army to go to Vietnam.  Sally continues the usual teen testy relationship with her mother Betty (January Jones) until step father Henry leaks some disturbing news about the latters health.  Joan (Christina Hendricks) leaves the rampant sexism at McCann and has starts her own production company forgoing a romantic relationship; Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) reconciles with ex-wife Trudy (Alison Brie), leaves McCann for a new job with Lear Jet and moves to Wichita; Roger and Marie (Megans mother) get married; and Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) and graphic artist the furry Stan Rizzo (Jay Ferguson) decide they love each other.

  So as you can see a lot happens in these final episodes and Weiner and associates try to tie up the storylines for the large cast of characters.  It stands to reason that not all fans will be pleased with how their favorite mad men are left at the closing credits.  For me the Peggy/Stan relationship didn't feel right as the two didn't seem to have much chemistry.  Don could never stay in some hippie West Coast world for long and even though its just implied that he returns to McCann/Erickson that made sense. Really a great series and my thanks to Matt Weiner for his meticulous recreation of the 60s and the era of my youth and showing me what my friends fathers did at work in NYC.",1522800000,,4402,4.63741935483871
