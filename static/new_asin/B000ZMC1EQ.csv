3042683,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Interesting film. Hard to believe that this expedition was filmed in real time. I have read many books and seen several films about climbing on Everest but this looked at day to day challenges. It was unclear though about the role of the sherpas in the ascents. Only the work with the poorly prepared climbers was zeroed in on, but in my understanding the sherpas have a strong role in each of the climbs. Not sure if we just did not see this part.",1464652800,,448,4.345238095238095
3042684,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Everest is my passion and Amazon Fire gives me lots of Movies and Documentaries to watch Love Fire TV,1464134400,,101,4.368421052631579

3042689,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I have always been fascinated by Mount Everest and those who find the will and guts to attempt the ascent of this magnificent mountain. This Discovery show was fantastic and gives the viewer a glimpse of what it takes to climb Everest. From the Sherpas, to the organizer and the climbers themselves, I felt as if I knew them personally. I will view this many more times.",1453680000,,370,4.537313432835821

3042693,4,B000ZMC1EQ,The cinematography alone is worth the price.,1447718400,,44,5.428571428571429
3042694,5,B000ZMC1EQ,By far the best season of this show.  Very interesting.,1445990400,,55,4.5
3042695,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I'm hooked on all of the stuff about Everest and mountaineering adventures... as a result, I purchased this to complete my collection of the Discovery documentaries on Everest.  It is shorter than the previous seasons, but still enjoyable.  I would recommend that anyone watch the 3 seasons of Everest Beyond the Limit in the order that they were produced, as there are recurring characters and story lines that would be much more understandable and meaningful if viewed (at least for the first time) in the original order.",1441756800,,523,5.0
3042696,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"No fake reality show here, real lives facing life or death decisions...",1441497600,,71,5.0

3042699,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"Purchased the season after I read Fox's No Place but UP! It's interesting and if you like Everest stories, you will probably like this series.",1435104000,,142,4.72
3042700,5,B000ZMC1EQ,I love stories of human courage and pushing to their physical limit.  This does not disappoint!,1428710400,,95,4.9375
3042701,3,B000ZMC1EQ,only 5 episode and same price as other season,1424304000,,45,4.111111111111111
3042702,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Easily the best documentary on Everest I have ever seen. Has me on the edge of my seat every time!,1416355200,,98,3.95
3042703,5,B000ZMC1EQ,There is a lot of controversy concerning the deaths of climbers and having to leave them on the mountain. This series will give you an excellent look at what it takes and the hazards these climbers face. It is truly one of the most gruelling adventures and I love it!,1416096000,,267,4.36
3042704,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This is a documentation on the 2006 Everest climbing season that saw many question the safety (and sanity) of Everest climbers. The characters involved in this year's climb include a biker from Los Angeles, California; a professional climber, who just happens to be an asthmatic, from Denmark; the ""big boss"" who is a mountaineering expert tasked with keeping everyone safe; an older French mountaineer recently operated on for cancer of the kidney; an LA fireman sandbagged by the altitude; a man with no legs (no, really--a bilateral below the knee amputee); and others, such as a Sherpa who is rapidly becoming a mountaineering legend with over 10 summits to his credit.

The story of these people and their ambitions is riveting and the characters addictive. You really feel like you're climbing the mountain with them, experiencing mountain sickness, piercing cold, dangerous snow and ice slopes, and dangerous hubris. I watch and rewatch this series because it is so involving. Also, I'm SO glad I'm not there with them--way too cold!

However, one of the most compelling moments of this series comes on the last day, when the climbers confront a dying climber while in the Death Zone--an area above 26,000 feet (8,000 meters) where rescue is practically impossible due to the lack of oxygen and dangerous terrain that threatens even the most talented and fit climbers. Their choices that day were brought into close inspection by the mountaineering and new communities, both of which questioned the morality of leaving a person to die that high up in the Death Zone. The climbers and expedition leader weigh in on the subject, which is also the subject of a documentary, ""Dying for Everest: The David Sharp Story"". Could they have done more? Watch and decide for yourself.",1408838400,,1779,5.027118644067796
3042705,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Very interesting and very informative! I enjoyed learning about Mt. Everest and the challenges that climbers face in the high altitudes.,1401235200,,136,5.523809523809524
3042706,5,B000ZMC1EQ,I'm really into anything regarding mountain climbing and this did not disappoint. It was very informative as well as entertaining.,1400976000,,130,5.55
3042707,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"The subject and the scenery are fascinating and engrossing. The crass incidental music and awful supermarket tabloid level voice over drags what could have been a great series down to average American TV level. I watched it all, and Season 2 (available on the other, red-themed streaming service) because the good bits are worth it if you are interested in the material.

Kudos to the camera crew for operating so well in such difficult conditions.",1400716800,,448,4.973333333333334
3042708,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Never thought I would enjoy this, but after watching I got hooked. There is an article in a People mag about the death of a Sherpa while on a climb....they do so much more than is shown. There should be a documentary about a Sherpa and what they do on a climb.....anyway I watched the whole series, loved it and wish there was more!",1399680000,,332,4.203125
3042709,5,B000ZMC1EQ,The greatest looped background voices I've ever heard. I really want to shake the hand of the their sound tech,1395705600,,110,4.55
3042710,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I was sad to realize that this was the final season of this Discovery series, as I found them to be educational as well as entertaining.  It's an enormous undertaking to run one of these trips, and having to deal with people whose actual abilities aren't in the same league as their aspirations takes a great deal of tact and diplomatic skill.  Gorgeous scenery, as always, although I do agree with some of the other commenters that there's way too much recapping and re-recapping in each episode (which is really noticeable when you watch them all at once online like I did).",1395532800,,576,4.637254901960785
3042711,5,B000ZMC1EQ,great inside view of the attempts to climb Mt.  Everest and the personalities involved in the climb to the summit.,1395187200,,114,4.7
3042712,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Amazing video of these adventurers as the battle the elements and limits of human abilities. Can't imagine how Sir Edmund Hillary did without 21st century technology.,1394841600,,166,5.423076923076923
3042713,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"The second and third seasons lack the detail and insight. The drama in this season is real (as opposed to the malarky they peddle in the others). Still, this is the b est way to experience Everest; in HD from a warm living room.",1394582400,,228,4.204545454545454
3042714,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"This didn't grip me as other mountaineering documentaries have, but it
is interesting to see Everest from the north again, as the British
attempted in the 1920s and '30s.",1394323200,,170,4.896551724137931
3042715,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"A look behind the scenes of a very incredible goal some set for themselves, and the dangers they face doing it.",1394236800,,111,4.333333333333333
3042716,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This is the best footage of Everest climbs I have ever seen! The close ups, the distance shots, all combine to give the viewer the best prospective without climbing the mountain themselves. This is a must view to get any kind of idea of what climbers must endure to reach the top of the world.",1394150400,,293,4.345454545454546
3042717,4,B000ZMC1EQ,This documentary follows a team of hikers as they attempt Everest. Gives you a good understanding of all that goes into this great challenge.,1393718400,,141,4.916666666666667
3042718,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I have read many books about the ascent to Everest, but nothing like this makes it understandable and real.  I recommend.",1393545600,,121,4.761904761904762
3042719,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"dont wright reviews...not my forte.  don't even do email as im sure you can see by now.  just wanted to let you know that as someone who has spent many hours watching numerous documentarys, i was so dissapointed when season three took on a whole different spin.  why do you feel it necessary to change a show  so completely upside down , when it was doing so well?  sometimesyou have to be ok with a good thing, even if its a short suscess.  you took away a very dramatic, emotional show., that had a huge message to so many,  and for some strange reason, flipped it upside down!?  as i said, you lost me at season 3.  know i wasn't the only one",1393459200,,645,4.178861788617886
3042720,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I loved this series!  I had read and re-read John Krakauer's Into Thin Air a few years ago and it was very exciting to actually see video of the key points along several Everest climbs.  The ladders over the ice falls had always been hard to invision - finally I understand.  The Discovery series also does a very good job of following the climbers and giving us a look into what drives them to attempt such a dangerous activity.  While it is always a very personal mission for each climber, we quickly see how dependent they are upon the help of the guides, sherpas, and other climbers, and how they are at the mercy of less prepared teams climbing the mountain along with the weather which is carefully monitored from base camp.  I will watch this series again.",1393372800,,763,4.5
3042721,5,B000ZMC1EQ,It took my breath away.  The courage and tenacity of the Sherpas were especially awe inspiring.  Here was an opportunity to share a unbelievable adventure from the warmth and safety of the couch.,1393200000,,195,4.878787878787879
3042722,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Excellent show, very suspenseful.  The story lines pull you in and feel like they do a great job of portraying the real dangers on the mountain.",1392940800,,144,4.538461538461538
3042723,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"After the first two edge of the seat seasons I was worried that this Discovery series would loose it's edge. Season 3 delivers! Now we finally get to see the incredibly dangerous and tremendously exciting original, historic southern route. Once again we brought face to face with the dangers, failures, successes and yes, the remains of climbers that never returned from their failed attempts to stand on top of the world. Is there a Season 4?",1392854400,,443,4.842105263157895
3042724,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Tremendously great series!!

I'm not a mountain climber...and due to age and disability, I'll never be one.  Still, this series makes you feel like you're really there.  I gained insights into mountain climbing, mountain climbers and especially the psychology of Everest climbers.  Such insights are interesting and valuable in understanding the best of human nature.

I particularly liked the story line about the firefighter that didn't summit; his process of self-realization as that occurred and after, taught us much about how to view the world.",1392681600,,550,5.423529411764706
3042725,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Love this series especially because they approach the summit from the south. The views are outstanding, and each episode has my heart in my throat. Going to watch it again.",1392163200,,172,4.766666666666667
3042726,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"i've really enjoyed the stories and watching the treks, but have grown tired of the repeating, repeating, repeating that is done both IN each episode and from episode to episode to episode... i think i could tell you each and every area in tim medvetz' body that has a steel pin or plate ; )",1392163200,,291,4.3090909090909095
3042727,5,B000ZMC1EQ,I learned a lot about the commercial climbs of Everest by watching this show.  I also found the people quite interesting and engaging.  I found myself rooting for them and hoping that they would make the summit.,1392076800,,211,4.675675675675675
3042728,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"it is a well crafted show which attempts to give you an idea of what climbing everest is like today.  it left me with the impression that the excess tourism has done no one any favors and the people who really wear summit badges are the guides and the sherpas.  it was well scripted (or at least) used well edited ""guided dialogue) and the photography is superb.",1391990400,,362,4.388059701492537
3042729,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"The best film I have seen about climbing Mt. Everest. The movie has six segments which gives enough time to show details of the struggles to make this climb. The over population of climbers is a point made very clear and the incompetence of so many climbers. It seems to me that climbers on Everest would need to provide some evidence of thier ability to climb at that altitude. Many seem to be clueless of their own level of usefull consciousness that oxygen deprivation causes. One level of experience that Everest climbers might be encouraged to get is in an altitude chamber. My own experience as a commercial pilot in an altitude chamber showed me that taking off my oxygen mask at 25,000 feet resulted in my loosing useful consciousness in little over one minute. The film led me to belive that the leader of the expedition did a very good job; but still had a great deal of difficulty getting his clients to follow his instructions I have read several books on climbing Everest since the first American expedition in 1963. I recommend this movie.",1391817600,,1053,4.666666666666667
3042730,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"If you love outdoor adventures, you will love this.  These people have to be the most driven people on the planet, to endure such punishing physical challenges in the most inhospitable environment imaginable!  I wish there were more seasons to watch!",1391558400,,250,5.073170731707317
3042731,5,B000ZMC1EQ,A great teaching tool about life which can be applied to anyone who watches this ..... especially after watching it the second time when the newness has abated and you can zoom in on what is really going on spiritually and motivationally.,1391299200,,238,4.690476190476191
3042732,1,B000ZMC1EQ,"Season one or two were very informative. Although people climbing shouldnt be, I applaude their determination. Everest is dangerous. It is also filthy. It is has enough drama in and of itself, and doesnt need the added drama discovery adds. What every happened to legitimate filmaking and just showing what happened? Russell Brice, Love him or hate him, he has presence. I wish they would release a few more mountaineering dvds on line.",1391299200,,436,4.986301369863014
3042733,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"One of the best set of films that share the excitement, pain and the limits of a human- physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Recommend it to all. As a photographer, great cinema photography in a place I would love to go but more than likely will not.",1390953600,,264,4.638297872340425
3042734,4,B000ZMC1EQ,Gives an interesting insight into climbing culture and the personal struggles some climbers go through on their way up the mountain.,1390867200,,132,5.333333333333333
3042735,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This places you right there. The highs and lows of climbing Everest come right before your eyes. It's much too easy for bad things to happen, but it becomes clear why reaching the summit is a lifetime achievement.",1390867200,,213,4.631578947368421
3042736,3,B000ZMC1EQ,I watched all three seasons and I thought season 3 was the least interesting. Little character development like in 1 & 2. I thought it would be interesting to see the south summit route as it was the route Hillary took but there wasn't much to hold my interest. Seasons 1 & 2 were far superior. Season 3 seemed like an after thought with no one really caring whether the show was of any quality.,1390867200,,395,4.28
3042737,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This was an exciting and informative program.  At times it is a bit gruesome.  The climbers are interesting to get to know and their courage is phenomenal.  I am not sure what drives these people, but they are amazing.",1390867200,,218,4.538461538461538
3042738,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"for many people summiting Everest is just a dream. This program shows the reality of an actual summit team trying to do what few people have done. Russell Brice is a true team leader who works hard trying to keep his teams safe. The scenery is spectacular and the stories are interesting, but the reality of the bitter harshness may be hard for some viewers. Good family entertainment, if monitored by adults. There is some graphic language and the sight of an occasional deceased climber. Overall a worthwhile program.",1390867200,,519,4.842696629213483
3042739,5,B000ZMC1EQ,We've always enjoyed watching the Everest shows this season is no different then all the rest. We highly recommend watching.,1390867200,,124,5.25
3042740,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"As I said in the second season, the show is really only 10 min long but the narrator repeats the scene over and over",1390867200,,116,3.875
3042741,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"It demonstrates what you need to partake in the adventure, but its sad that a ladder is used & such a natural resource is exploited...both the mountain & the sherpa!",1390867200,,165,4.533333333333333
3042742,5,B000ZMC1EQ,I enjoyed the show. I like adventure reality shows. But I do not like the view tips and guidelines below this box.,1390348800,,114,4.2272727272727275
3042743,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"Beautiful, intense and real.  A glimpse into an experience that most will never come close to understanding.  Discovery Channel at its best",1390262400,,139,5.2727272727272725
3042744,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This is an amazing way to experience what the mountaineers do, in good detail.  You can see how they live, how the leaders manages the adventure, how the acclimatization works, how the training and test runs go.  Finally, you get to see the big climbs themselves, especially the nature of the physical challenges, terrain, etc.  You see details like the lines that form, and the huge impact this can have on a summit attempt.  And you see how real injury and death is on the mountain.
Excellent footage and narrative lines make this a must see - especially if you have a passion for the wilderness and especially for mountains!",1389830400,,627,4.672727272727273
3042745,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"The photography was great!
The coverage of the expedition was very well done.
We enjoyed it very much.
Watch it!",1389830400,,112,4.65
3042746,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Great documentary, seems like south route is a bit easier than north, probably is as hard as the other. Well done reality, great narration, great guides and crews. highly recommend watching it.",1389830400,,193,5.0625
3042747,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Interesting and moving. A great vicarious adventure. One of the many benefits of subscribing to Amazon Prime. Very great photograpy,1389830400,,131,5.6
3042748,4,B000ZMC1EQ,This setup for TV so it repeats things at times. Very good camera work and the facts are shown when needed.,1389830400,,107,4.142857142857143
3042749,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Interesting show. I would have liked there to be more of it, but I realize it is hard to film at that elevation.",1389830400,,112,3.9130434782608696
3042750,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Another great season. I find this series very inspiring and couldn't stop watching it. Highly recommend!  I wish they would have continued with another season.,1389657600,,159,5.36
3042751,5,B000ZMC1EQ,This program kept me on the edge of my seat.  It's amazing how far some people can push themselves.  Highly recommend.,1389398400,,118,4.571428571428571
3042752,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"I like the Everest series, but I liked the way they filmed the north face climbs in seasons 1 &  2, better than the south in season 3.  It is cool that season 3 is filmed in wide screen.",1389225600,,186,3.7435897435897436
3042753,5,B000ZMC1EQ,The show is very interesting and full of adventure.  Ran through the first season pretty fast and started right up with season 2,1389052800,,128,4.565217391304348
3042754,5,B000ZMC1EQ,Great first person perspective of what it takes to summit Everest. You become emotionally attached to the characters and are on the edge of you seat waiting for the next step up Everest. Can't wait to see season 2.,1388880000,,214,4.512820512820513
3042755,5,B000ZMC1EQ,The most detailed documentation of an Everest summit I have ever seen. Great detail for those of us who have the desire to try the climb and for those who wish we could do it but never could. The reality TV drama is a bit much at times but overall an incredible look into an experience most of us could never dream to undertake.,1388880000,,328,4.140625
3042756,4,B000ZMC1EQ,The great human experience is filmed. This takes you through all the base camps and the trials at each. I literally found myself breathing harder the higher up they went.,1388793600,,170,4.7

3042760,2,B000ZMC1EQ,"Everest and other mountains in the world have been summitted by mountaineers who know climbing and take every precaution to climb safely. The mountains present logistical challenges that have to be met with unique skills attained from years of climbing. For the most part, mountain climbing is a team effort; climbers' lives depend on their skills and the skills of fellow climbers.
Many of the people who pay to climb Everest these days have legitimate reasons, for example the 71-yr old Japanese climber featured briefly in season 2.
But this series focuses on a handful of egotistical people for whom summitting Everest proves that they can do anything they want to do; the climb is all about them, and they really don't care about anyone else. The commercial expeditions encourage this kind of selfcenteredness by sending the ""climbers"" out one by one with minders.
The real story of Everest today is about the Sherpas who climb the mountain incredible skill and mindfulness. But to my knowledge no one has written their story or told it in film. No one has told the story of the cameramen and professional climbers.
I dislike the presentation of this kind of reality television. The overly dramatic narration, the psuedo-cliff-hanger moments, the in-your-face interviews with the ""he-men or women"".
I became interested in Mount Everest in 1967 and I have read many of the accounts of exploring the region and the mountain. Climbing Everest has become a circus, and this series features the circus clowns and  a few of the real stars.",1388188800,,1538,4.98443579766537

It is very interesting to study the various personalities as well as the technical and physical challenges that make up an Everest expedition.

Seasons 1 & 2 show expeditions up the North side (from Tibet).  Due to political unrest of the past few years,  season 3 focuses on climbing the South side.  This south side route is the original route climbed by Norgay and Hillary when Everest was first climbed in 1953.  As pure entertainment I enjoyed the series.  But for me, the careful repeated watching is what has taught me the most about extreme altitude mountaineering and been the most value.

Although climbing Everest is out of the budget (!) it does not cost $60,000 - $100,000 get get into the needed physical and mental shape to do such a thing - it just takes effort.

3042782,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Of the 3 Beyond the Limit seasons I like season 3 (S3) the best.

Pros:  As usual the visuals in all of the Beyond the Limit series are excellent but in S3 some of the camera angles show just how steep the face of Everest can be and how difficult it is for the climbers.  Furthermore, I like the way that different climbing teams were highlighted in the 5 episodes.  Instead of focusing on one team for the 5 episodes I was able to see different personalities making the climb.

Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on your gore tolerance), in S3 there are not any examples of extreme frostbite as have been seen in previous seasons, however there were several cases of stomach problems.

The camera work is amazing that you can follow individual climbers all the way to the summit and the Sherpa cams make it almost seem as if you were there in person.

Cons:  I would like to have seen more technical information about the climbing equipment and the difficulties that the climbers have to overcome.  For instance where/how does one do his/her business.  I saw more yellow snow in S3 than in all of the other Everest videos that I have seen (episode 5 did did deal with how some of the climbers dealt with dysentery).

Also, if oxygen is a critical issue on the summit why don't the climbers take 3 or 2 1/2 bottles of O2 when they summit.

Conclusion:  After watching many Everest videos I am continually reminded that the real unsung heroes of these expeditions are the Sherpas.  They prepare the route all the way to the summit, they stock the intermediate camps along the way, and they are the ones who bail out the newbies who probably should not be climbing the summit.

3042817,2,B000ZMC1EQ,"Discovery Channel's third season of Everest: Beyond The Limit began airing this past Sunday, and subsequently finished up last night. The show did offer some amazing views of the mountain, and showed aspects of high altitude mountaineering, but personally I felt that it was mere shadow of its former self, and mostly ended up being a disappointment for me.

In the previous two seasons of the show, Discovery followed teams that were led by Russell Brice's Himex guide service on the North Side of the Mountain, located in Tibet. With the third season, the focus shifted to the South Side of Everest, found in Nepal. Brice's team returned, but the show also added climbers from Eric Simonson's IMG squad to the mix too.

All of this was well known before the show began airing, and it all seemed rather promising, but that was because I kept thinking of the possibilities in reference to the previous two seasons. I thought it would be great to see an in depth, multi-episode show centered around the very different approach to the South Side, with two teams giving us plenty to watch. What we got instead was Everest: Beyond The Limit Lite, a show lacking the depth and focus of the previous seasons, and in many ways it seems that Discovery gave up on the program before it ever aired.

I remarked in a previous post on this blog that it was disturbing that Discovery did little in the way of promotion for the show. I could barely find any reference to it on their website, and debuting the show during the week before Christmas and New Year seems like ratings suicide. Looking at what we ended up getting, I think that was a fairly accurate assessment. I can't imagine fans of the previous two seasons being satisfied with what we've been given this year.

For example, in seasons past, we really got to know the climbers well over a series of episodes that showed them making the entire climb, including acclimatization treks up to each of the established camps on the mountain. Watching this season it seems that a climb up Everest is merely five days of incredibly challenging climbing, rather than the month plus spent preparing for a summit bid. The producers of the show really glossed over the process, focusing instead on a different climber or two each episode who are making their assault on the summit, all the while the narrating reminding us that they are moving into the most dangerous part of the mountain. We're suppose to forget that it is a different ""most dangerous part of the mountain"" than the last time they mentioned it.

I will commend the show for it's solid camera work, which seemed to get better as the episodes went along. It also did a decent job of breaking down the climb into easy to understand sections, accurately indicating when climbers were on the Lhotse Face, the Yellow Band, or the Hillary Step. They also did a fine job of explaining the basics of mountaineering to a mainstream audience, even if they were a bit overly dramatic at times.

Where the show really dropped the ball for me was with building any kind of chemistry with the climbers, which was previously a strength in seasons past. In Seasons 1 and 2, you really got to know, and care about, the climbers, as you watched them work really hard to go after their goal of the summit. This year, it was a brief introduction of the climbers, and then off they'd go on their climb, with little regard to connecting with the audience.

It's a shame that the show has fallen to this level. While it is still interesting to watch, it is a far cry of what it once was, and has pretty much left me disappointed in the end product. I very much doubt we'll see a Season 4.",1297209600,,3669,4.583841463414634
3042818,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"Season 3 of Everest: Beyond the Limit isn't near as good as Season 1 or 2.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and was hungry for more.  Seasons 1 and 2 follow Russell Brice's Himex Everest guide company as they get amateur climbers to the summit of Everest. For season 3, things change.  Season 3, episodes 1-3 follow a different competing company, only episodes 4-5 are footage of Brice's team.

The main difference is that seasons 1 and 2 built the suspense as the season went along. The first episode introduced you to the team, the second to ""warm up"" then up to the summit (or failed attempts) and the aftermath of getting back down.

Season 3 is more like 5 disjointed mini-documentaries.  Other than all taking place in one climbing season and finding stories from two climbing teams, the episodes have no other connection and no real flow from one to the next.  There also are no stand out characters, like ""Biker Tim"" or Mogens from the first and second seasons.  Season 3 also takes the climbers along the south route, instead of the north, and there never seems to be as good of a clear picture as to the exact route.  In seasons 1 and 2, by the end, you felt like you had traveled the entire North route and knew it.  In season 3, the climbers will often ""jump"" from one camp to the next with no footage of what was in between.

Overall, if you liked seasons 1 and 2, than 3 is worth a watch.  Try the first episode and decide if you want to complete it.  There aren't any cliffhangers in ep. 1, so if you don't like it, you won't feel like you are missing anything in the rest of the episodes.  If you are new to the Everest: Beyond the limit series, start with Season 1 and go from there.",1292544000,,1705,4.2875
3042819,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"I didn't like this season as well as season 1 and 2. They did a lot more camera work that was remote rather than with a cameraman on the mountain. I didn't care about the characters much and I got bored and didn't even finish watching the season. With that said there was some very exciting moments and as usual, I was in awe of the mountain and the people that climb it.",1290902400,,371,4.095890410958904
3042820,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"Season 1 and 2 covered the North East ridge.
With season 3 we finally get to see the South East ridge: this is a first big plus for season 3 versus season 2.
Season 3 also has a different format: season 1 and 2 cover one group of climbers (from acclimatization and base camps all the way to summit bids and descent); on season 3 we get to see different groups at batches (from early season to -dangerously close- season end). I liked this format and in a way it complemented the other 2 seasons, however the previous approach was probably more effective (we get to know a bit more about the climbers and their struggle).
I liked the coverage of some of the acclimatization on a mountain near base camp (this is something season 1 and 2 lacked a bit in my opinion).
As per the other seasons, it was not easy to tell if one climber would have been able to make the summit or not.
Here a few misses.
On season 3 you get a better feeling about how steep the route is in specific points, something the previous  seasons were not as good. Still room for improvement in my opinion.
I missed more detailed explanations on why for a climber (which summited from both ridges) the South East was more difficult/dangerous than the North East one (even if the amazing avalance coverage on the Icefall between base camp and camp I alone could be a good explanation). Or it could have been expedition leader Russell himself to explain that.
As with the other two seasons I would have liked to see more coverage for the sherpas: I think at least two or three should have been through some short interview, explain their motivation for this dangerous job; high in the mountain they could have filmed each other a bit more and it would have been nice to hear their comments on how their clients were doing, or even simple chat on whatever subject, technical or not.
This season was shorter than the other two (5 episodes instead of 6 or 8).
This is a review of the episodes as seen on TV. The DVD might have a lot of great extras.",1282694400,,2012,4.365333333333333

Like the best Peckinpah westerns it was also strangely beguiling and somehow shot through with an elegiac tone that balanced every moment of macho posturing with ominous intimations of mortality... The Wild Bunch go climbing and all the better for it!
Kevin Maher, The Times 06/02/07

`""Beyond the Limit"" is a stunning tour de force, easily the best documentary on Everest, perhaps the finest footage on climbing ever produced... ...run out and get a big-screen HD television, but the real magic of ""Beyond the Limit"" is in the human stories.'

3277201,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This is a documentation on the 2006 Everest climbing season that saw many question the safety (and sanity) of Everest climbers. The characters involved in this year's climb include a biker from Los Angeles, California; a professional climber, who just happens to be an asthmatic, from Denmark; the ""big boss"" who is a mountaineering expert tasked with keeping everyone safe; an older French mountaineer recently operated on for cancer of the kidney; an LA fireman sandbagged by the altitude; a man with no legs (no, really--a bilateral below the knee amputee); and others, such as a Sherpa who is rapidly becoming a mountaineering legend with over 10 summits to his credit.

The story of these people and their ambitions is riveting and the characters addictive. You really feel like you're climbing the mountain with them, experiencing mountain sickness, piercing cold, dangerous snow and ice slopes, and dangerous hubris. I watch and rewatch this series because it is so involving. Also, I'm SO glad I'm not there with them--way too cold!

However, one of the most compelling moments of this series comes on the last day, when the climbers confront a dying climber while in the Death Zone--an area above 26,000 feet (8,000 meters) where rescue is practically impossible due to the lack of oxygen and dangerous terrain that threatens even the most talented and fit climbers. Their choices that day were brought into close inspection by the mountaineering and new communities, both of which questioned the morality of leaving a person to die that high up in the Death Zone. The climbers and expedition leader weigh in on the subject, which is also the subject of a documentary, ""Dying for Everest: The David Sharp Story"". Could they have done more?

I had read and re-read John Krakauer's Into Thin Air a few years ago and it was very exciting to actually see video of the key points along several Everest climbs.  The ladders over the ice falls had always been hard to invision - finally I understand.  The Discovery series also does a very good job of following the climbers and giving us a look into what drives them to attempt such a dangerous activity.  While it is always a very personal mission for each climber, we quickly see how dependent they are upon the help of the guides, sherpas, and other climbers, and how they are at the mercy of less prepared teams climbing the mountain along with the weather which is carefully monitored from base camp.

Many seem to be clueless of their own level of usefull consciousness that oxygen deprivation causes. One level of experience that Everest climbers might be encouraged to get is in an altitude chamber. My own experience as a commercial pilot in an altitude chamber showed me that taking off my oxygen mask at 25,000 feet resulted in my loosing useful consciousness in little over one minute.

3277235,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"for many people summiting Everest is just a dream. This program shows the reality of an actual summit team trying to do what few people have done. Russell Brice is a true team leader who works hard trying to keep his teams safe. The scenery is spectacular and the stories are interesting, but the reality of the bitter harshness may be hard for some viewers. Good family entertainment, if monitored by adults. There is some graphic language and the sight of an occasional deceased climber. Overall a worthwhile program.",1390867200,,519,4.842696629213483

You can see how they live, how the leaders manages the adventure, how the acclimatization works, how the training and test runs go.  Finally, you get to see the big climbs themselves, especially the nature of the physical challenges, terrain, etc.  You see details like the lines that form, and the huge impact this can have on a summit attempt.  And you see how real injury and death is on the mountain.

3277252,5,B000ZMC1EQ,The most detailed documentation of an Everest summit I have ever seen. Great detail for those of us who have the desire to try the climb and for those who wish we could do it but never could. The reality TV drama is a bit much at times but overall an incredible look into an experience most of us could never dream to undertake.,1388880000,,328,4.140625

3277257,2,B000ZMC1EQ,"Everest and other mountains in the world have been summitted by mountaineers who know climbing and take every precaution to climb safely. The mountains present logistical challenges that have to be met with unique skills attained from years of climbing. For the most part, mountain climbing is a team effort; climbers' lives depend on their skills and the skills of fellow climbers.
Many of the people who pay to climb Everest these days have legitimate reasons, for example the 71-yr old Japanese climber featured briefly in season 2.
But this series focuses on a handful of egotistical people for whom summitting Everest proves that they can do anything they want to do; the climb is all about them, and they really don't care about anyone else. The commercial expeditions encourage this kind of selfcenteredness by sending the ""climbers"" out one by one with minders.
The real story of Everest today is about the Sherpas who climb the mountain incredible skill and mindfulness. But to my knowledge no one has written their story or told it in film. No one has told the story of the cameramen and professional climbers.
I dislike the presentation of this kind of reality television. The overly dramatic narration, the psuedo-cliff-hanger moments, the in-your-face interviews with the ""he-men or women"".
I became interested in Mount Everest in 1967 and I have read many of the accounts of exploring the region and the mountain. Climbing Everest has become a circus, and this series features the circus clowns and  a few of the real stars.",1388188800,,1538,4.98443579766537
3277258,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"I really enjoy this series - it's mind blowing that people pay that amount of money to put their lives in very real jeopardy.  I can't really relate to wanting to climb Mt Everest, but I love watching other people push themselves beyond what seems possible to achieve their dreams.  The double-amputee who successfully summited was particularly moving.  A great watch!  I wish Discovery would consider picking this series up again.",1388102400,,431,5.028169014084507

No written phrases about the Kumbu icefall compare to the visuals, and the grueling nature of the climb is quite evident.

3277263,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"The series really draws you in and makes you care about each climber. Before long I found myself rooting for them all to make the summit, even though I knew most of them wouldn't. I nearly cried when Mogens and Tim had to turn back. I did a little climbing in the Rockies in my youth and have been an armchair mountaineer most of my adult life.

3277267,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"This series is a great introduction to what it would be like (to have $60,000 - $100,000) and go climb Everest with a top notch group. It is very interesting to study the various personalities as well as the technical and physical challenges that make up an Everest expedition.

Seasons 1 & 2 show expeditions up the North side (from Tibet).  Due to political unrest of the past few years,  season 3 focuses on climbing the South side.  This south side route is the original route climbed by Norgay and Hillary when Everest was first climbed in 1953.  As pure entertainment I enjoyed the series.  But for me, the careful repeated watching is what has taught me the most about extreme altitude mountaineering and been the most value.

Although climbing Everest is out of the budget (!) it does not cost $60,000 - $100,000 get get into the needed physical and mental shape to do such a thing - it just takes effort. Google online the Everest expedition sites and look at their fitness suggestions. Enjoy!!",1382572800,,1003,4.6647727272727275

The guides attempt get them as far as they can without getting them killed. Every year several people die climbing this mountain. There are about 200 bodies on the mountain that they can not bring down.

Yes there are mountains (difficult things) we can not climb. If you have the youth, guts and $ cash you to can attempt this. But for the rest of us, practical people, we will be happy with the series.

3277279,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Of the 3 Beyond the Limit seasons I like season 3 (S3) the best.

Pros:  As usual the visuals in all of the Beyond the Limit series are excellent but in S3 some of the camera angles show just how steep the face of Everest can be and how difficult it is for the climbers.  Furthermore, I like the way that different climbing teams were highlighted in the 5 episodes.  Instead of focusing on one team for the 5 episodes I was able to see different personalities making the climb.

Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on your gore tolerance), in S3 there are not any examples of extreme frostbite as have been seen in previous seasons, however there were several cases of stomach problems.

The camera work is amazing that you can follow individual climbers all the way to the summit and the Sherpa cams make it almost seem as if you were there in person.

Cons:  I would like to have seen more technical information about the climbing equipment and the difficulties that the climbers have to overcome.  For instance where/how does one do his/her business.  I saw more yellow snow in S3 than in all of the other Everest videos that I have seen (episode 5 did did deal with how some of the climbers dealt with dysentery).

Also, if oxygen is a critical issue on the summit why don't the climbers take 3 or 2 1/2 bottles of O2 when they summit.

Conclusion:  After watching many Everest videos I am continually reminded that the real unsung heroes of these expeditions are the Sherpas.  They prepare the route all the way to the summit, they stock the intermediate camps along the way, and they are the ones who bail out the newbies who probably should not be climbing the summit.

 As an Amazon Prime member I got to watch Season 3 for free.  Yea!!",1372982400,,1748,4.498412698412698

3277311,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"Recently watched season one and two after having found it for the first time through Amazon Prime.
Great series, could hardly pull my eyes away. You really start relating with these people after awhile (except maybe with the arrogant Tim Medvetz). You almost start feeling their pain and discomfort and really become concerned when there may be a possible fatality.

I have never been a climber except for a little bit of rock climbing myself but in my opinion this series is an excellent production. For inspiration and a glimpse at the human spirit I highly recommend this series.",1356825600,,582,4.878787878787879
3277312,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"Considering what happened with the abandonment of lone climber David Sharpe and Brice's role in that abandonment during this expedition year, I expected to see Brice as more of a professional. He is not. To abandon a climber in distress because they are not part of your group is totally unacceptable. The 2006 Everest controversy confirms the 1996 disaster that too may people are on Everest at once and that Everest has become nothing but a commercial venture. And these are not climbers, these are what are called dudes. Those who pay for an experience for lots of money and most are not very pleasant people.",1335744000,,612,4.783018867924528
3277313,5,B000ZMC1EQ,"This third and final season is a much quicker look at many different folks climbing everest. Each episode is about a different group and situation. BUT, its what I saw of this season that got me hooked on the show.

After all, its an adventure when a climber is told to munch on six asparin and then get marching down off the
top of the mountain as soon as he can(before he has a heart attack). Seasons one and two are more of a longer story but this is worth seeing and watching it ""on demand "" as it cost a lot less than the dvds for this third season have gone for.  Check out the other seasons one and two also. In those seasons you can watch Biker Tim Medvets and Mons Jensen (attempts summit without supplement oxygen) both go for it and keep Russel and the sherpas on there toes. Purba Tashi is an epic sherpa guy to see and what he can accomplish at 29,000 feet. He backpacks someone down off the mountain to safety.",1329091200,,924,4.185393258426966
3277314,2,B000ZMC1EQ,"Discovery Channel's third season of Everest: Beyond The Limit began airing this past Sunday, and subsequently finished up last night. The show did offer some amazing views of the mountain, and showed aspects of high altitude mountaineering, but personally I felt that it was mere shadow of its former self, and mostly ended up being a disappointment for me.

In the previous two seasons of the show, Discovery followed teams that were led by Russell Brice's Himex guide service on the North Side of the Mountain, located in Tibet. With the third season, the focus shifted to the South Side of Everest, found in Nepal. Brice's team returned, but the show also added climbers from Eric Simonson's IMG squad to the mix too.

All of this was well known before the show began airing, and it all seemed rather promising, but that was because I kept thinking of the possibilities in reference to the previous two seasons. I thought it would be great to see an in depth, multi-episode show centered around the very different approach to the South Side, with two teams giving us plenty to watch. What we got instead was Everest: Beyond The Limit Lite, a show lacking the depth and focus of the previous seasons, and in many ways it seems that Discovery gave up on the program before it ever aired.

I remarked in a previous post on this blog that it was disturbing that Discovery did little in the way of promotion for the show. I could barely find any reference to it on their website, and debuting the show during the week before Christmas and New Year seems like ratings suicide. Looking at what we ended up getting, I think that was a fairly accurate assessment. I can't imagine fans of the previous two seasons being satisfied with what we've been given this year.

For example, in seasons past, we really got to know the climbers well over a series of episodes that showed them making the entire climb, including acclimatization treks up to each of the established camps on the mountain. Watching this season it seems that a climb up Everest is merely five days of incredibly challenging climbing, rather than the month plus spent preparing for a summit bid. The producers of the show really glossed over the process, focusing instead on a different climber or two each episode who are making their assault on the summit, all the while the narrating reminding us that they are moving into the most dangerous part of the mountain. We're suppose to forget that it is a different ""most dangerous part of the mountain"" than the last time they mentioned it.

I will commend the show for it's solid camera work, which seemed to get better as the episodes went along. It also did a decent job of breaking down the climb into easy to understand sections, accurately indicating when climbers were on the Lhotse Face, the Yellow Band, or the Hillary Step. They also did a fine job of explaining the basics of mountaineering to a mainstream audience, even if they were a bit overly dramatic at times.

Where the show really dropped the ball for me was with building any kind of chemistry with the climbers, which was previously a strength in seasons past. In Seasons 1 and 2, you really got to know, and care about, the climbers, as you watched them work really hard to go after their goal of the summit. This year, it was a brief introduction of the climbers, and then off they'd go on their climb, with little regard to connecting with the audience.

It's a shame that the show has fallen to this level. While it is still interesting to watch, it is a far cry of what it once was, and has pretty much left me disappointed in the end product. I very much doubt we'll see a Season 4.",1297209600,,3669,4.583841463414634
3277315,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"Season 3 of Everest: Beyond the Limit isn't near as good as Season 1 or 2.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and was hungry for more.  Seasons 1 and 2 follow Russell Brice's Himex Everest guide company as they get amateur climbers to the summit of Everest. For season 3, things change.  Season 3, episodes 1-3 follow a different competing company, only episodes 4-5 are footage of Brice's team.

The main difference is that seasons 1 and 2 built the suspense as the season went along. The first episode introduced you to the team, the second to ""warm up"" then up to the summit (or failed attempts) and the aftermath of getting back down.

Season 3 is more like 5 disjointed mini-documentaries.  Other than all taking place in one climbing season and finding stories from two climbing teams, the episodes have no other connection and no real flow from one to the next.  There also are no stand out characters, like ""Biker Tim"" or Mogens from the first and second seasons.  Season 3 also takes the climbers along the south route, instead of the north, and there never seems to be as good of a clear picture as to the exact route.  In seasons 1 and 2, by the end, you felt like you had traveled the entire North route and knew it.  In season 3, the climbers will often ""jump"" from one camp to the next with no footage of what was in between.

Overall, if you liked seasons 1 and 2, than 3 is worth a watch.  Try the first episode and decide if you want to complete it.  There aren't any cliffhangers in ep. 1, so if you don't like it, you won't feel like you are missing anything in the rest of the episodes.  If you are new to the Everest: Beyond the limit series, start with Season 1 and go from there.",1292544000,,1705,4.2875
3277316,3,B000ZMC1EQ,"I didn't like this season as well as season 1 and 2. They did a lot more camera work that was remote rather than with a cameraman on the mountain. I didn't care about the characters much and I got bored and didn't even finish watching the season. With that said there was some very exciting moments and as usual, I was in awe of the mountain and the people that climb it.",1290902400,,371,4.095890410958904
3277317,4,B000ZMC1EQ,"Season 1 and 2 covered the North East ridge.
With season 3 we finally get to see the South East ridge: this is a first big plus for season 3 versus season 2.
Season 3 also has a different format: season 1 and 2 cover one group of climbers (from acclimatization and base camps all the way to summit bids and descent); on season 3 we get to see different groups at batches (from early season to -dangerously close- season end). I liked this format and in a way it complemented the other 2 seasons, however the previous approach was probably more effective (we get to know a bit more about the climbers and their struggle).
I liked the coverage of some of the acclimatization on a mountain near base camp (this is something season 1 and 2 lacked a bit in my opinion).
As per the other seasons, it was not easy to tell if one climber would have been able to make the summit or not.
Here a few misses.
On season 3 you get a better feeling about how steep the route is in specific points, something the previous  seasons were not as good. Still room for improvement in my opinion.
I missed more detailed explanations on why for a climber (which summited from both ridges) the South East was more difficult/dangerous than the North East one (even if the amazing avalance coverage on the Icefall between base camp and camp I alone could be a good explanation). Or it could have been expedition leader Russell himself to explain that.
As with the other two seasons I would have liked to see more coverage for the sherpas: I think at least two or three should have been through some short interview, explain their motivation for this dangerous job; high in the mountain they could have filmed each other a bit more and it would have been nice to hear their comments on how their clients were doing, or even simple chat on whatever subject, technical or not.
This season was shorter than the other two (5 episodes instead of 6 or 8).
This is a review of the episodes as seen on TV. The DVD might have a lot of great extras.",1282694400,,2012,4.365333333333333

Like the best Peckinpah westerns it was also strangely beguiling and somehow shot through with an elegiac tone that balanced every moment of macho posturing with ominous intimations of mortality... The Wild Bunch go climbing and all the better for it!
