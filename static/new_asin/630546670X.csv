7890883,1,630546670X,This is a strange documentary. The imagery on the screen often has nothing to do with what the narrator is saying. It's too disjointed and makes little sense. Not enough Godzilla talk to keep my attention,1264032000,,204,4.694444444444445
7890884,4,630546670X,If you are a life time Godzilla Fan this documentary is for you.  Other reviews on this item state that the picture quality is not very good and that Godzilla only shows up for a couple of minutes of footage.  This is not the case.  Picture and Sound are fine for what it is and this DVD highlights all the Godzilla movies up until the 90's.  There is also a lot of interesting info about other monster movies from the 30's right up until the 90's.  My husband is a huge Godzilla fan and he really enjoyed this product.,1140393600,6,519,4.202020202020202
7890885,3,630546670X,"""Godzilla and Other Movie Monsters"" doesn't actually focus on Godzilla. It is a documentary that primarily educates on the history of giant monsters and dinosaurs in the movies, which end up being as varied as Rodan and King Kong to the cartoon ""Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur."" Like most low-price documentaries, the clips are mostly from public domain sources, such as trailers or, in some cases, actual scenes from public domain movies. While certainly not great, ""Godzilla and Other Movie Monsters"" is a reasonably entertaining and informative documentary.
The DVD actually has a few bonus features. ""Godzilla Rap"" is not great, and would probably play well without the sound on. ""The Lost World"" consists of highlights of the 1920s silent movie. The best extra is ""Bambi Meets Godzilla,"" a famously shocking and hilarious short cartoon.",1070668800,13,838,5.214814814814815
