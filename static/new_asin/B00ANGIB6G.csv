5460102,5,B00ANGIB6G,"This movie has the most air combat action footage of the more advanced version of the mighty, high-tech, rugged, and heavily armed F-15E, the new F-15K, built for South Korea's advanced tactical fighter competition, and now the ROK's primary long-range strike fighter. Fans of the F-15E or F-15K will find the ample air combat action footage satisfying because they really used the F-15K throughout the movie with lots of spectacular maneuvers, firing of missiles such the AIM-9M Sidewinder against the newer MiG-29 Fulcrum which appeared to have used it's vectored thrust engine against a skyscraper in one of the air combat sequences, rippled firing of 4 training versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder against 5 training targets on the ground during the training competition scene which created a huge realistic explosion, cobra maneuvers made by the MiG-29 Fulcrum and the Korean Aircraft Industries (KAI) FA-50 which climbed up into the sky then turned off the engine for a free-fall towards the bay waters in front of an air show crowd then turned its engine back on at full afterburner just before hitting the water which created waves that splashed the airshow crowd!  The F-15E and F-15K are much more advanced than what the movie portrayed, however, there were 2 instances where the radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow and beyond-visual-range AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) were used against the MiG-29 in this movie in an effort to make the movie more entertaining, they stuck mostly with close-range air combat instead, with the MiG-29 and F-15K pilots literally looking each other in the eye by flying past each other upside down at supersonic speeds then shooting each other with the plane's gattling guns and heat-seeking missiles. There was also 1 instance of two F-15Ks using 2000-pound JDAMs against ground targets, and the FA-50 using an AGM-65 Maverick infrared and tv-guided missile on 2 separate occasions, one against an underground bunker with the maverick flying deep into a tunnel before obliterating an entire underground squadron of MiG-29s, and the other against an ICBM silo. Finally, the FA-50 used an AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking missile to destroy the North Korean Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) just after it launched from its silo, homing in on the missile's huge heat exhaust, detonating the missile's fuel and warhead in one powerful explosion that took out the whole enemy command bunker. Overall, the jet fighter combat action footage in this movie is superior to any other jet fighter movie ever created, easily beating past Top Gun, Iron Eagle, or Air Force One. At present, this is the first and ever extensive non-classified use of the powerful F-15K, a more advanced version of the F-15E in any movie out there. You can also see some great HD footage of the F-15K on YouTube by searching the keyword ""F-15K"" but you'll be missing the storyline, the silly humor, and the compelling emotional drama perfected by the main characters, which communicates the story well. The acting of the characters is good on the drama side, showing natural human emotions of anger, grief, and vengeance, and values such as humility, self-discipline, and modern leadership professionalism, but sometimes overly cocky, trivial, vague, or style-outdated on the humor sections, reminiscent of old Bruce Lee movies. It seems that many of these older South Korean actors grew up watching those types of kung-fu movies which have had a great influence on their acting style. They also did the tower flyby scene with the F-15Ks screaming past their commanders spilling coffee on their shirts similar to the Top Gun scene, which sort of became tradition among fighter pilot movies, or maybe it was supposed to be funny. The awesome display of military discipline and self-control was also inspiring. I particularly didn't appreciate the physical assault by one of the commanders on one of the pilots during the beginning part of the movie since that behavior is no longer tolerated in any modern military organization, realistically that would get any military member locked up in the brig or discharged if not demoted to the lowest rank and punished with extra duty at minimum. Fraternization was also the basis for the whole romance story in this movie, where the lead fighter pilot actor falls in love with his F-15K's mechanic or technician who happens to look like the Binondo Girl actress, Kim Chiu, a beautiful and intelligent technical specialist who also used to fly the F-15K and flies gliders as a hobby over the scenic Korean peninsula during her free time, which they both flew on a date and landed on a beach in one of the romance scenes. Another lead fighter pilot actor fell in love and proposed to his subordinate co-pilot or Weapons Systems Officer (WSO). To sum up this movie fairly, the air combat action footage involving the real F-15K is superb to any other movie out there in terms of realism, detail, technical complexity, sophistication, and video quality which exploits the latest advances in High Definition (HD) technology. The story and character environment is set in modern-day South Korea with modern skyscrapers in the high-tech city of Seoul and realistic modern-day scenarios, with outstanding performance by civilian extras on the ground when the MiG-29 attacked the city by opening fire on civilian vehicles on the streets and tall buildings. If close-range air combat were ever to take place between North and South Korea in today's world, this is how realistic it would look like. However, the F-15K is much more capable in beyond-visual range air combat using the venerable AIM-120D AMRAAMs to take out enemy aircraft from ranges of over 120 nautical miles using the F-15K's APG-70 Advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AAESA) radar and other advanced long-range sensors. It is also armed with long-range strike weapons such as the Joint Stand-off Weapon (JSOW) with a range of over 1,500 nautical miles, that distance is like almost the entire length of the East Coast, with the capability to cruise at low altitude, GPS, infrared, and optical sensor guidance, it's almost like putting a Tomahawk cruise missile on an F-15E. However, all that long-range capability of the F-15K was not shown in this movie to make it more watchable to the movie-going audience who would rather see close-range swirling dogfights which the F-15K maneuvered for superbly with its new pair of Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229 digital engines, the responsiveness of the maneuvers was crisp and instantaneous and much more powerful with two digital high-performance jet engines, which also enabled the lead pilot actor to pull off the cobra maneuver, a rare footage for this new high-tech, rugged, heavily-armed beast, the F-15K from Boeing, in cooperation with the high-tech Korean Aircraft Industries. This newest version of the F-15E is now Boeing's most popular export long-range strike fighter aircraft for high-tech air forces such as the legendary Israeli Air Force, Republic of Korea (ROK) Air Force, Royal Saudi Air Force, and recently, the Republic of Singapore Royal Air Force, outperforming foreign exports of the F/A-18F Super Hornet and the Dassault Rafale in recent years. So overall, this movie has almost all the elements of a great movie: high-tech action, compelling story, compelling actors, romance, some humor or comedy, character-building ideals or moral lessons such as self-discipline, self-control, and military professionalism, but lacks any or is almost completely devoid of any sexual content to keep up with the tradition of Top Gun, maybe because of the more restrictive culture, or maybe to have a broader movie audience in the PG-13 category.",1366848000,3,7738,5.185451638689049
5460103,3,B00ANGIB6G,"I am a Rain fan so I couldn't wait to get this movie.  The action scenes were great, but it didn't have much of a story line.  Still, since it's a Rain film, I'm glad I got it.",1366588800,,176,3.6052631578947367

5460125,3,B00ANGIB6G,".....this movie would be it. There are some differences, no aircraft carrier, Slam Eagles in place of Tomcats, no overly ""just for the chicks"" volleyball clips, but this movie generally follows the Top Gun script. Granted, the flying sequences from Top Gun were better than this movie, the live in-flight parts of the movie of the F-15K are good. It is also nice to see the SAR teams in action and a general sense on how South Korean SAR operations play out. But I would hope that their ground crew personnel aren't the bumbling idiots that the movie occasionally portrays them.
This is a ""sit down with a lot of popcorn"" movie made for the masses that matches a lot of Hollywood movies today with a lot of action, explosions and noise, and little on reality and facts....and should be viewed as such. It's an alright movie, I'll watch it when I'm building my model aircraft or if I want to watch something different.",1380326400,,917,4.597560975609756
5460126,5,B00ANGIB6G,"I love Jung Ji Hoon (Rain), so I will watch just about anything he makes. I thought it was a pretty good movie-- cute. The movie also stars another of my favorites, Kim Sung Su (who co-stared with Rain in ""Full House""). I still have my finger crossed for ""Ninja Assassin 2,"" but until then, I'll take ""Back 2 Base,"" or whatever else I can get.",1378684800,,343,4.212121212121212
5460127,1,B00ANGIB6G,"OK, good air combat scenes. That's out of the way now.

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other than a loose stream of scenes and unattractive people, especially Sgt. Yu who's supposed to be so hot everybody wants her. She's sullen, somber, withdrawn, sour, and even that is limp and lame.

Occasionally inspired cinematography, some nice little shots, small vignettes, nothing any film school grad should not be able to do.

I'm out of stuff to write about. NOTHING here. NOTHING going on. I turned it off at 48 minutes.

In fairness, in reading the other reviews, it seems Asian fans and others got a lot more out of it than I did, so maybe it's cultural. OK, so I'm old school, USA---REALLY Old School.

TOP GUN, it is not. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer? No.

5460138,5,B00ANGIB6G,"I will start off by stating that I am a huge fan of Jung Ji Hoon (Bi/Rain) and Korean Dramas. That being said, I was very interested in this movie on more than one level. I LOVED Top Gun with Tim Cruise and realized the similar story theme in this movie. However, since Black Eagle is based on a story from 1964, there were bound to be differences. I found this movie to have a familiar feeling but with the differences that come from another country. It's a good thing.

Rain was true to his reputation in this movie with quick wit, flashy smiles and abs, and an onscreen presence that can't be denied. He is a natural fit for a cocky ace pilot whose looking for a chance to prove he's the best, and looking for love wherever it may appear. I also enjoyed seeing TWO women in strong character positions. They were inspirational in their roles.

The aerial shots were very appealing and well done, with lots of action. The movie had a gritty, realistic feel to it. This was the first movie of it's kind to ever be filmed in South Korea. While it may not hold up completely to US standards for a blockbuster action film, Black Eagle came VERY close. I felt it definitely was worthy of my rating of 5 stars for being the first of it's kind from South Korea, and being of such high quality.

I have read complaints about the format of the movie: aka taking too long to get to the action scenes, being heavy handed in parts, etc. I don't agree with these complaints. I have logged about 3000 hours of watching South Korean TV series as well as Kpop movies. Black Eagle is true to their form of story telling. My only complaint is that, as a movie instead of a TV series, there wasn't enough time to fully develop some parts of the story. Of course, this is in comparison to a minimum of 16 hours for a story. Not possible within the time frame of a movie.

If you enjoy fighter jets, testosterone-filled confrontations, defiance of stiff regulations, a good love interest, and good looking actors, this is a good show to watch. I am happy to own a copy of this show.",1373673600,3,2062,4.320413436692506

5460143,3,B00ANGIB6G,"Jeong Ji-Hoon aka. Rain, the star of ""Ninja Assassin,"" is Captain Jung Tae-yoon, youngest pilot admitted to South Korea's Black Eagles aerobatic team, who is transferred to the 21st Fighter Wing after doing a dangerous stunt during an air show. The disgraced pilot strives to regain the position and honor he lost by winning the upcoming competition, with a help from a mechanic (and love interest) Technical Sergeant Yoo Se-young (Shin Se-kyung).

The first half of the film is light-hearted and comedic in tone, short on action scenes and special effects. At around the one-hour mark ""Black Eagle"" (also known as ""R2B: Return to Base"" and ""Soar Into the Sun"") gets more serious and action-packed, with the advent of the North Korean air forces. Effects are decent if not outstanding, and aerial sequences are beautifully shot.

It is reported that the film is a remake of a Korean movie ""Red Scarf"" (1964), which I have not seen. Whatever the original may be, the remade version suffers from all-too-familiar storyline, stock characters and heavy-handed direction in the romantic comedy part. Still, those who are looking for thrilling aerial action scenes will find the film fairly entertaining, especially its action-filled second half.",1370390400,2,1240,5.195
5460144,4,B00ANGIB6G,I liked this movie. They did a good job with the character development and there was lots of action.

5460146,5,B00ANGIB6G,"Rain (Bi) is outstanding! This movie is better than Top Gun! Great action, good story line. Exciting! I can't wait for Rain to continue acting/singing/dancing!",1368748800,,159,5.4
5460147,4,B00ANGIB6G,"If you can look at a movie that is a Korean Top Gun knock-off as something that might be enjoyable, then go ahead and dive on into Black Eagle, because that's what it is, and it's certainly enjoyable.

Pretty much everybody's seen Top Gun, so I won't trouble you with the storyline to Black Eagle too much, since it's essentially the same. A rogue-ish fighter ace gets kicked out of his high-flying stunt crew for doing a bannned stunt, and has to return to the military and egos clash as he works his way to becoming the best...and ultimately saving the day.

But, it's done well enough. The characters are written well, the story stays mostly humorous with some poignant, but not overly sappy moments. And the action, particularly a jet fighter chase through Seoul is perfectly gripping.

That's really all there is too it. It's a perfectly acceptable Top Gun knock-off. Now, if you're looking for a story with more originality that can offer up something new and maybe stretch what you've experienced a bit--it won't do that. But it's a solid Korean blockbuster nonetheless and solidly enjoyable the whole way through.",1367020800,,1121,4.7979274611398965

8554716,1,B00ANGIB6G,"I'm amazed at the praise this movie got. The dogfight scenes were 100% CGI and horrendously unrealistic. The planes were drifting like cars in The Fast and the Furious!

The acting was cringe worthy. There is a female aircraft mechanic who looks more like a pop girl band singer. She looks less than 5 feet tall, and she yells and gives orders to pilots - so NOT intimidating it's laughable. The commanders that the pilots answer to are good, the the rest, meh.

If you want a fighter jet movie with no CGI whatsoever and better acting, Sky Fighters is the movie to get. All the flying scenes are real (including a scene where a plane breaks the sound barrier above a runway) and the cinematography is phenomenal.",1480809600,,713,4.5625
