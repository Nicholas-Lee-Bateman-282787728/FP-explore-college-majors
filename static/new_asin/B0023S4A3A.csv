8349882,4,B0023S4A3A,"This is the 5th DVD in the ""Darker Than Black"" series. Since this DVD contains episodes 19 - 22, I recommend starting on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Volume-One/dp/B001F2U728/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black: Volume One</a>&nbsp;as there is a lot of backstory not explained in these episodes.

These are actually 2, two part episodes that continue to develop Hei (AKA: BK201, The Black Reaper) and the rest of his team (especially Yin, the ""Doll""). We also start to see some more insights into ""The Syndicate"" (the group Hei works for) and the shadowy Pandora organization.

There is a lot more plot development in these two chapters and great action. As before, the animation ranges between very good to very bad.

Recommended! The next DVD can be ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darker-Than-Black-Volume-6/dp/B002BWD74Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darker Than Black: Volume 6</a>",1258070400,,1007,6.8515625
