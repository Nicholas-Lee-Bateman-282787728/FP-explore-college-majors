It is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING that they have made this game work on DVD. Using the remote, you are able to gather clues, interview suspects, take the cases to trial and solve three mysteries. There is even a way to ""save"" the current game and return to it days later. It is delightful to have the judge tell you at the end of a game how well you did in comparison to Sherlock Holmes.
The videos are much clearer than on the PC version and, instead of small, middle of the screen images, they fill the whole screen making it easier to inspect things and view scenes. The sound is excellent.
One of the geat things about the game is that you can go back and play it differently and interview other people and view other situations just to see how to solve the case in a different manner so that replaying is a definite option.
If you enjoy Sherlock, mysteries and using your brain to solve puzzels, then this is definitely the DVD for you.
There is a preview for another game, ""Dracula Unleashed"" which is one of my favorite computer games. I can't wait for the realease of this DVD after seeing the magnificent job they have done with ""Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective"".
There are two other volumes of Sherlock that are also promised for a future date (based on how well this one sells)so the future looks great for this type of DVD.",981504000,15,1504,4.39426523297491
7916771,3,B0000365E2,"I must mention to those curious about this DVD that it is a rehash of the original CDROMs from the early 90s.  While I don't have the DVD version I can tell you about the game.  You get an intro to the mystery and then choose where to visit/interview and are shown a video clip of this.  The acting is fairly good and it takes some thought to solve the clues.  But then you realize some problems.  You can cheat by just visiting every spot, and sometimes you end up in a spot where you get a clue that makes no sense because you are ahead of yourself.  The problem was that you were expected to find things in a certain sequence but if you don't think they way they expected you to you end up missing some clues.  I can tell you a little bit about the mummy's curse; a death occurs in a museum after a mummy is brought in from a ship.  You should interview the museum director, the students of the professor, the people on the ship, and the family of the deceased.  You can also cheat by trying to arrest everyone and see which one is correct.",971568000,8,1043,4.123762376237623
