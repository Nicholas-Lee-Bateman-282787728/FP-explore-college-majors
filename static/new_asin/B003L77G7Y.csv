4137693,4,B003L77G7Y,"This volume of American Dad is solid but doesn't have the stand-out episodes of past volumes.  Volume 6 has stand-out moments, though, like when Roger is on the airplane in ""Home Adrone"" and switches costumes between little girl Katelyn and Stan.  Roger as Jeanie Gold Wedding Planner in ""Shallow Vows"" is hilarious.  There were quite a few lines that had me laughing out loud, too, which are included in the brief summaries below.  This series is still more hit than miss.

Disc 1:
""In Country...Club""--Steve is selected to sing the National Anthem at the Langley Falls Veteran's Day celebration and Stan thinks he won't sing it properly unless he goes to Vietnam...reenactment golf course.  Roger makes their experience more hellish as he tries to get the Pay-Per-View code for ""Barbra Does Celine.""  Highlight: Roger's Streisand experience.  Bonuses: original televised episode, commentary, deleted scenes.
""Moon Over Isla Island""--Stan only pretends to be friends with Roger to get something in return and Roger is fed up with it just as Stan really needs him to impersonate the dictator of Isla Island.  Highlight quote: Stan--""Bad news, Roger, the beach is closed.  Yeah, apparently it's mating season for the diarrhea seals.""  Bonuses: original televised episode, deleted scenes.
""Home Adrone""--Steve is left home alone and accidentally unleashes a military drone from Stan's study.  Highlight quote: Roger as little girl Katelyn, ""My middle name is Miracle 'cause I was born attached to a dead twin who had a second butt where its mouth was supposed to be.""  Stan--""Tha-that is messed up.""  Bonus: deleted scenes.
""Brains, Brains, and Automobiles""--Stan is afraid Francine will find him boring and leave him, so he avoids being alone with her which includes keeping Roger dependent on them.  Highlight quote:  Francine--""The cable's out and I just got my period so there's nothing to do but talk and talk and talk.""  Bonus: deleted scenes.
""Man in the Moonbounce""--Stan tries to make up for the childhood he missed by leaving all the adult responsibilities to Steve.  Highlight: Stan ""egging"" a house by hiding Easter eggs.  Bonus: deleted scenes.
""Shallow Vows""--Francine is mad Stan only married her for her looks so she lets herself go before they renew their vows.  Stan must go to extreme measures to live with her.  Highlight quote: After Jeanie Gold Wedding Planner (aka Roger) introduces her two sons, Stan--""How is that possible...that you have children when your persona is totally fabricated..."" Bonus: deleted scenes.

Disc 2:
""My Morning Straight Jacket""--Stan thinks he's kindred spirits with MMJ singer Jim James.  Highlight: Francine being choked by a vacuum while Stan listens to MMJ on headphones.  This episode got me into this band.  Awesome songs like ""I'm Amazed"" and ""Remnants"" are played.  Bonuses: original televised episode, commentary, deleted scenes.
""G-String Circus""--Hayley starts a business for charity and Stan insists it be dry cleaning.  When she refuses his advice, Stan gets a group of strippers to start the business.  Meanwhile, Steve and friends break out of a very dull science camp.  Highlight: Roger in his Madame costume.  Bonus: deleted scenes.
""Rapture's Delight""--The rapture happens while Stan and Francine are being unholy in a church janitor's closet.  Stan thinks he deserves to be Raptured and would leave Francine for it.  Francine leaves him and ends up as Jesus's girlfriend during the Seven Year War.  When she is captured by the anti-Christ (one of the most annoying characters ever), Jesus needs Stan's help to save her and mankind.  Crazy episode but the ending is touching. Highlight quote:  Terry--""You may notice my partner Greg isn't here, that's because he was raptured.  Apparently God loves gays but only if they're tops.  Take it in the behind, you get left behind.""  TONS of bonuses.
""Don't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth""--Money is tight but Stan wants to keep his SUV, so he gambles on Roger's racehorse and has his brain switched with it.  Highlight quote: Stan to his SUV--""I'm going to take you to make-out point and tongue your gas hole."" Bonuses: original televised episode and deleted scenes.
""A Jones For A Smith""--Stan is on the rampage against any form of welfare or social help, even when he naively becomes addicted to crack. Rather disjointed episode.  Highlight: Roger opens the door to Stan's withdrawal pod for a comb allowing Stan to escape and then asks himself, ""Why do I need a comb?""  Lots of bonuses.
""May the Best Stan Win""--Francine is mad because Stan would rather be a cyborg after he dies than be buried with her.  When a more considerate cyborg Stan from the future arrives, Francine falls in love with him.  Highlight quote: Stan (on Hershey Park)--""Milk Chocolate World is great.  I loved White World, didn't care so much for Dark World."" Bonuses: original televised episode, deleted scenes.

Disc 3:
""Return of the Bling""--Stan finds out his American heroes--the 1980 US Hockey Team--included Roger.  When Roger admits to being on steroids at the time, Stan insists on returning his Olympic gold medal.  Meanwhile, Reginald the koala tries to befriend Hayley.  Highlight:  Reginald--""Well it's not easy to beat down a fool and still look [singers chime in] cute as a button.""  Bonuses: original televised episode, deleted scenes.
""Cops and Roger""--Roger feels emasculated when he runs away while Francine is mugged so he joins the police academy...and then turns into a dirty cop his first day on the force. Highlight quote: Roger--""Plus I'm a sociopath so all this fits me like a slipper."" Bonus: original televised episode and deleted scenes.
""Bully For Steve""--Stan is mad that his son keeps backing away from confrontations, so he becomes his bully.  Highlight quote: Stan to Francine--""Followed you last week.  I don't know what you thought was in your b-hole in the Target parking lot but you were really trying to find it.""  Bonuses: original televised episode, deleted scenes.
""An Incident At Owl Creek""--Stan is afraid his family will embarrass him at a neighbor's pool party and ends up accidentally defecating in their pool.  He then moves the family to different places trying to escape his shame.  Highlight:  Klaus talks about how disgusting Stan's act was while pooping in his fishbowl. Bonuses: original episode, deleted scenes.
""Great Space Roaster""--Roger wants a Family Roast for his birthday but cannot take the insults and the Smiths are forced to go into space to try to escape his revenge.  Highlight quote: Roger--""I drove [her] to two of her first three abortions.  She must have such regret...never getting her driver's license.""  Bonuses: original televised episode, commentary, deleted scenes.",1307491200,,6730,5.166358595194085
4137694,5,B003L77G7Y,I've been a fan of American Dad from the very first episode. Roger is the best character on television today. Love it!,1305158400,2,118,4.409090909090909
4137695,4,B003L77G7Y,"When the first season of American Dad came out, I said we really need to keep an eye on this because it has potential to develop into something really great (I said that with King of the Hill as well, and was right).  American Dad now has 6 volumes, all increasingly better.  In my list of favorite animated shows, this easily takes spot number 2.

American Dad has a smorgasbord of interesting characters and all of them are coming out in full force for volume 6!  Roger is on point, he is the most rude he has ever been, and when AD spoofs Lord of the Rings he is an EXCELLENT Smeagol!  Stan is still the typical conservative tight @$$ ""All American"" male.  Meaner than he has been in the past, harder on Steve than ever with some quotes that totally vomit on Steve's confidence.  Steve is still his nerdy self, but when he gets Post Traumatic War Reenactment Syndrome, oh lord its funny!  A nice new take on Steve's more ""savage"" side.  You also get to see the ups and downs of Haley's relationship with Reggie, the killer Koala bear.  The Mad Max type spoof in ""Rapture's Delight"" you just have to see, because its great.  But what I loved most, was when the family roasted Roger on his birthday.  I'm not going to spoil it for you, because to me its one of the best moments of interaction between animated characters ever!

My only complaints are:
1- As one reviewer said, certain episodes are not uncensored.  I don't know why that is, but it disrupted the flow for me.  That was the whole reason I bought the DVD! For uncensored material!!!

2- Reggie is just a weak character to me.  I hate his script.  He really has no good jokes, and it really annoys me.  I would like to see him once or twice.  I honestly think its time to kill him off.  Just my opinion.

You really can't talk about American Dad without mentioning Family Guy.  I think American Dad has just blown away Family Guy.  The writing has been better, the characters are way more interesting, and the jokes/spoofs are fresh.  So far none of the characters have underwent such a drastic change that is destorys their very fabric of meaning (like Stewie going from being hell-bent on murder to a possibly in the closet homosexual) or Brian (one day he hates black people, one day hes dating a black girl, one day he sees Jesus IN HIS HOUSE, the next day hes Atheist)  Plus, Family Guy for the most part was becoming all-out political propaganda.  Sad that American Dad (the show that is based heavily on political viewpoints) has saved us from that.  I'm obviously a conservative, but thats my beliefs and I respect liberals views just the same as mine.  But I cannot stomach having more liberal media crammed down my throat by way of my once favorite animated tv show that is supposed to be based on shock comedy, fun, and lewdness more than the government.  American Dad pokes fun at both sides of the fence.  You have Stan with his conservative outlook and then Haley counteracts with her liberal ways.  Priceless.  Its all in balance.  I don't have to sit there and get fired up because I feel like someone is singling me out.  Libs and Cons can laugh at themselves then at each other through this show.  I absolutely love that and its one of the reasons I think American Dad is taking over.  I hope AD does the episodes 1-3 spoofs of Star Wars instead of Cleveland show!",1305072000,7,3346,4.444078947368421
4137696,2,B003L77G7Y,Most of the episodes are censored. First episode is uncensored but almost all of the others are bleeped out. Really sad. Look Fox/Seth we're all grown ups here. Not gonna offend anyone. Still love the show though just think we got screwed again.,1304640000,18,245,4.72093023255814
4137697,2,B003L77G7Y,"In big letters on the back at the top it says ""Uncensored and Outrageous"" and in the small print describing the special features it says ""on select episodes"".  This is annoying and misleading.  I want the uncensored version of each episode! Also annoying is that half the episodes are full screen and half are wide.  This show is still great but this collection seems like an uneven thrown together hodge-podge.",1304467200,7,411,4.8428571428571425
4137698,5,B003L77G7Y,"Let me just say that I am glad that they finally have decided to release a full season. In the past, though the sets and features were great, we only got partial seasons.

Also, as of now(3/20), in addition to not having the Bonus Content listed, Amazon does not have the art work posted for the set( Of course, that could change by the time you read this review) All they have at this moment is a generic photo of the Smith family with Animation Domination written across the top. In case anyone is wondering, the art work has been released and here it is:

[...]

If you don't trust the link or if Amazon doesn't show links in reviews, or if the image is removed from the link by the time you view it, just do a Google image search of ""American Dad Volume 6"" and it should come up with a few results. The art work features the Smith family against a police mug shot backdrop wearing costumes from the various Volume 6 episodes.

Hopefully the info helped and hopefully you enjoy this show as much as I do! Buy the set, it's worth it, and tell your friends so this show lasts and lasts.

NOTE: I've now had a chance to view the whole set and it's contents and want to add that only some episodes feature uncensored audio/video. It says it on the back and some episodes the dialogue is still beeped. Seems a bit strange that they would do this with only a few episodes, but whatever. Thought it was worth a mention.",1300579200,23,3194,4.8474264705882355

Every episode on this set is great. Can't think of any that I really didn't like. The season premeire ""In Country... Club"" is one of my favorites. Very clever episode(using golf carts as helicopters in a Vietnam War reenactment). ""May the Best Stan Win"" was also very funny. Love the futuristic cyborg version of Stan with a Canadian/Mexican accent. But perhaps the best episode ever is ""Rapture's Delight"", the 2009 Christmas episode. The 2nd half of the episode where Stan and Jesus turn into B-movie action stars who journey to defeat the anti-Christ while uttering terrible puns is hilarious. One of Stan's best lines ever comes in this episode: ""I guess I just picked a whole bouquet of oopsie-daisys.""

Starting with the first episode of 2010 ""Don't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth"", this episode and every episode after it on the list above are shown in a Widescreen format.

Awesome set of episodes. 18 episodes is the most since Volume 3 and most of the episodes in this set come with the uncensored version and the original TV version for each episode.",1299542400,4,1640,4.713286713286713

This is like my favorite season of AD. If I was asked what my favorite episode from this season was it would have to be in raptures delight (The animation and story plot in the episode was superb. I will support American Dad until my last breath. I remember seeing the first episode of American Dad in 2005. I stopped watching the show a little bit because it wasn't continuous as Family Guy. However I started watching American Dad! again in 2008 and realized how much Family Guy actually is not funny. American Dad! is so very funny, entertaining, and witty.

As opposed to Family Guy, which is just punchline after punchline with no substance, this show actually takes time with its story and characters. Also, it's insane. Just watch the episode ""Rapture's Delight"" and you'll see what I mean. I can't imagine any other show depicting the apocalypse and completely pulling it off.

If you like Seth McFarlane's sense of humor like Cleveland Show or Family Guy, this is a must buy to add to your collection.",1370995200,,585,4.7254901960784315

It's bad enough that I was hearing beeps sporadically throughout Volume 5, but right out of the gate in Volume 6, I heard beeps all over the place. I can watch the show on Hulu plus or Netflix if I wanted to see the televised versions!

This collection was a little disappointing in that There were not a lot of interesting extras and some of it was still censored, but the content was good.  The characters in this show are exaggerated and outrageous at times yet they seem very human in their faults and failings. I wish they would tone down the violence in some episodes, but you have to realize this is fantasy.  That is the contradiction in this show: the characters seem believable and yet the situations are totally unbelievable. It is not for everyone, but I enjoy it.",1339200000,,594,4.584905660377358

4138088,4,B003L77G7Y,"I purchased Americna Dad! Vol. 6 after finding the latest Family Guy (Vol. 9) release to be quite humorous.  I'm a fan of the creator's work and feel that at times, American Dad! is a bit more grown up in terms of it's humor (if only by a minute level).

The content for this season is what one can expect from a series made by Seth McFarlane: a disfunctional family full of Type A personalities from differing points of the social spectrum.  The jokes are creative and relevant to the times, and the writing is sharp and at times makes you think about what's truly being commented on.

The one downside I've found with this season is that aside from the first episode, the rest of the content is censored.  This was quite a surprise as I thought that when purchased, we were to expect an uncensored version of what was aired on Fox.

All in all, this is a wonderful edition to any collector of Seth McFarlane's work.  Be aware though, if you want to save some money, and yet not miss any content, just watch the episodes on Fox.  With the censoring implemented on the discs, there's hardly any difference.",1326412800,6,1106,4.4405940594059405

As good as Family Guy and much much better than the lame Cleveland show.",1325548800,,338,4.317460317460317
4138090,5,B003L77G7Y,"I really like Seth Macfarlane, his cartoons are awesome! I like the type  of humor they have which is of course mostly considered as  outrageous , way too  real for TV, shocking and definitely not for kids!!! It is actually impressive to see the number of lawsuits that were filed against macfarlane for some of the themes and personalities he's been joking about. But it doesn't matter, FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD are definitely here to stay as they now found a wider and more mature audience to support them!

I also grew up watching the Simpsons on TV like everyone else and remember thinking this was the best show ever. Although as i got older, i came to realise that bart's adventure were not as appealing to me as they were a few years before and i slowly lost touch with the simpson. I guess i kinda thought i was getting too old to watch cartoons. Then  FAMILY GUY came along with AMERICAN DAD and Seth Proved me and millions of people that we weren't too old for cartoons, we just needed one with some more mature  and adult content. Thats what this show is, its for adults, mature people that aren't afraid to have a good laugh at sensible topics once in a while...

I hope this show stays on TV for a while, its really refreshing and its by far the most hilarious cartoons ever made!!  I just hope that they keep the show the way it is...with all those lawsuits and angry people im afraid that one day, Seth and his team may be asked to soften their touch, and thats the last thing i want. I want this show to stay true to what it is....outrageously funny and hilarious!!!

Thank you Seth for this amazing cartoon!!.. keep up the good work!!!!  I would also like to thank the Smith family : Stan, Hailey, Francine, Roger ,Claus and Steve...May you guys stay with us again for many more years of fun and entertainment!!!!!!

ENJOY!!!!",1325030400,,1846,4.431952662721893

4138093,4,B003L77G7Y,"From the creative minds of Mike Barker, Matt Weitzman and Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy & The Cleveland Show), ultra conservative C.I.A. agent Stan Smith and the uproarious Smith clan returns for more outrageous family values and really big laughs in American Dad! Volume Six. In this collection of 18 hilarious episodes from the show's fifth season, Stan teams up with Jesus Christ to battle the Antichrist in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Francine is shocked to learn that Stan only married her for her looks, and lets herself go in a big way to see if her husband really does love her. Steve participates in a Vietnam War re-enactment, but the experience leaves him looking and acting like a traumatized war veteran. The family celebrates Roger's 1600th birthday by roasting him, but the events ends up with Roger on a murderous rampage and the rest family on the run. Hayley helps boost Klaus' self-esteem by giving him a wig so he can have his first haircut in years. In its fifth season, American Dad! continues to have some moderate success and features memorable guest stars like Will Forte, Andy Samberg, Ricardo Montalban, Kat Dennings, Donald Faison, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Bryan Cranston, Sandra Oh and Zach Galifianakis.

With such standout episodes like In Country ... Club and Rapture's Delight, American Dad! Volume Six is sure to become a welcome addition to your home video collection. The first nine episode are presented in full frame, while the other nine episodes are in 1.78:1 widescreen. The transfer quality is quite sharp and its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is clear and well-balanced. There are audio commentaries and uncensored audio tracks on selected episodes. Other special features include several deleted scenes and The Making of Rapture's Delight featurette. Overall, American Dad! Volume Six scores a ""B"".",1311897600,,1831,5.144295302013423
4138094,3,B003L77G7Y,"Although I think American Dad is the best of Seth's shows, they've really punked out on the extras on this DVD set.  Past Volumes had interesting commentary and great deleted scenes.  The commentaries on this volume are horrendous, even including some bit with a chick that has never watched the show but is friends with the wife of one of the guys that works on American Dad or some such nonsense.  It was so boring and ridiculous that I couldn't be asked to pay enough attention to figure out if it was meant to be ironic or if it was just completely lame on its own.

Dear American Dad producers: if you want to know what good extras/commentary/deleted scenes are then buy yourself a Futurama DVD.  That.  Also, and though many others have already said, uncensored does not mean bleeping Francine dropping F bombs.  If I want to watch that crap I will Tivo your show and burn copies straight from Fox.  Yeah, I said it.  The whole reason I buy the DVDs is so that I have access to the extras that, until now, have not completely sucked.  I will think long and hard about buying the next volume unless it returns to previous form.",1310947200,9,1132,4.451456310679611
4138095,5,B003L77G7Y,"One of the best shows on TV returns for Season 6 in this 18 episode boxed set.

Among the 18 were some of the best episodes this series has produced yet like when Stan gets addicted to crack or Steve pilots a drone bomber over Langley thinking it's a computer game, or when Roger becomes dictator of a small island nation. But of the 18 is probably the best American Dad episode ever, ""Rapture's Delight"", where the Rapture happens and Stan and Francine get left behind. Stan's selfishness causes Francine to leave him for Jesus and then the episode fast forwards 7 years. I won't give away spoilers but it's an awesome cross between Mad Max and T2's Judgment Day.

And the movie references are in most of the episodes - Lord of the Rings, Sideways, Alien, Police Academy, Rambo, they're all riffed on brilliantly. There's also some pseudo-movies the writers create themselves such as ""Mind Quad"" where a psychic quadriplegic goes on the run, a new squirrel movie begins (the last being the Gilbert Grape squirrels) and the saga of the jewel encrusted golden turd continues.

Other faves in this series are Stan as a cyborg, Steve going through war trauma after a Vietnam war re-enactment on a golf course, and Reggie the Koala returns. Plus there's a lot of uncensored stuff that you don't notice on TV - there's so much swearing on American Dad, or at least there is in this series, and you get to see Stan's junk too.

The extras on the DVD aren't great - ""American Dad Honours Its Four Legged Friends"" is basically an advert for the first 5 seasons on DVD while the Rapture's Delight extras are too short being at 5 mins max. The commentaries are funny though.

Overall, I loved it. Hours of entertainment and side jokes that I couldn't even begin to list in this review. The writing on the show is better than that of Family Guy and Cleveland Show put together and the plots seem to hang together better for repeated viewings. If you're a fan of the show and wondering if it's getting better or worse, the show is stronger than ever and this box set is a must buy. Who can wait each week for a single episode? An awesome collection, I used to think Family Guy was better but this season puts American Dad on top.",1310688000,,2217,4.5049751243781095
