We see a 12-story building in a big city. The News-Register newspaper has a lonely hearts column. A man enters to look for a wife. Its for a friend who has a 50,000 acre ranch (over 78 square miles). The newspaper editor asks Mary to volunteer for this job. That area has an economic development that is threatened unless the people can get a right-of-way over Johnsons land. Roy and Smiley look for Jerry, who just drove away. We learn about a practical joke, There is a runaway horse by these visitors. [Stunt double?] Jerry Johnsons foreman rescues them. There is a plot to benefit someone in spite of a will! [Jerrys maturity is shown by his speech. Is this an occupational disease of inherited wealth?] Roy Rogers sings about your own backyard. There is a disagreement; Roy punches Jerry and is fired!

Jerry blames Roy for the other mens decision to quit. Can Jerry call the Sheriff for aid? [Note the familiarity with pistols.] There is a fight and a drawn pistol! Jerry drives off fast, a man shoots at his car. The shooter switches rifles with Roy! Roy brings up the body. The Sheriff arrests Roy as the prime suspect. Who will find the real killer? Mary looks for Mr. Miller. They learn Mrs. Johnson is a newspaper reporter. What does she have on this case? Miller has a plan to take care of Mrs. Johnson. Roy arrives just in time to save Mary and her friend Millie (but they don't know it). She tells Roy she saw his rifle in the Tack Room. [She is a trained observer.] Rout uses threats to get Buck to talk; it works. The Sheriff drops by to arrest Roy. Buck is dead. Frog makes a mistake! Can Roy escape from his jail cell? [Dont try this at home!] An explosion alerts the law. But Roy rides away and takes a short cut.

Mary and Millie are hiding in a ghost town. Lucky and the crooks arrive there to capture them. But their horses are driven off. Lucky escapes, his gang starts shooting. Can Roy save the girls by using an old wagon and six horses? Who will reach the Sheriff first? Frog joins Roy to provide support. [Stunt doubles do their work.] The Sheriff and his posse follow the wagon until it goes into a river. Mrs. Johnson tells the Sheriff what happened. Next Mrs. Johnson signs the right-of-way agreement so people can benefit from oil drilling. Next she will share her lands with the other people in a cooperative oil company. Everyone cheers! Mary will stay awhile. There is a song at the end, a comic ending, and another song

The quality of this story made it better than others. It has a complex plot about small landowners and their economic well-being. The big landowner is hostile to other people and mismanages his property. The songs are an added attraction.",1404777600,,2720,4.5
