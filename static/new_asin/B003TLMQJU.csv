I disagreed with a few key points. I don't believe the US deserves for any Native American to serve in the military as long as Native American rights are being ignored. Why should natives serve to preserve a government that continually betrays them.

I don't believe that Native Americans ...""must"" ...respect the Christian and the Jewish faith. Both of these religions teach that the world was under water about 6000 years ago when the Jewish / Christian god created the world. Then that god separated the waters above and the waters beneath and made dry land appear. Native Americans were in the US long before 6000 years ago and would have been killed by such an arrangement. Then the Jews and Christians go on to teach that about 4700 a global flood occurred killing everything not in Noah's ark in the middle east. This would have killed my Native Ancestors. This would mean I couldn't ....as a descendant...possibly exist. New world plants that gave rise to the tomato, potato, corn, beans etc would have been wiped out. No these plants didn't respread from neighboring islands as the plants there would have also died. So when I ...with Native American ancestors,...go eat fries with ketsup...it should be obvious to all that the Christians and Jews have lied. According to the Christian Bible, Jesus allegedly descended from Adam and Noah and believed in the garden of eden story and the story of Noah's flood. Would a god or someone with direct communication with a god...really be ignorant  of the fact that the Adam and Eve story and the Noah's flood story were obvious lies?

These same Jews and Christians that tote a bible into their church or synagogue  listen to how to be kind to their neighbor. They show what they have really learned by disrupting the religious practices of Native Americans, whether it be prayer, ceremony, or burial of dead.

I don't respect the rights of christians and Jews to get loud and drunk next to Indian sacred sites. There are acres and acres of empty land out west. Why...insist on disturbing Native Americans?

If these bikers want respect, they should earn it by their conduct. They could...raise money and MOVE the rally to a location that disturbs no one.

I don't buy the wheelchair chopper excuse. Anyone disabled and yet desiring to go to a sacred site could be carried there by peers with no need for helicopters. In other words a way to accommodate the disabled can be made and not disrupt the religious activities.

I also don't buy the excuse that ...the rally only goes on for a week. Whats wrong with taking one week away from the Native Americans? Soon it will be a week and a half, then two weeks. Eventually it will be all summer long. Where is the line drawn as to what is right?

The rally can be moved. There are plenty of places to go cause trouble, and get drunk.

The new rally site needs to set up toll roads so that participants in effect pay for clean up after a rally.  It should pay for trash pick up, police salaries, emergency shelter and travel expenses for women abandoned at rallies, extra guards on roads leading to residential areas or other private areas, extra ranger coverage at nearby national parks, established campgrounds with laundry and sanitation facilities...etc. An annual permit could be arranged to be allowed past the toll site. Early payment could be discounted to allow for items that should be set up well ahead of the arrival of rally members. Native Americans could be given priority for hire. The local Native American community should be asked to assist in selecting a site for the rally and given final veto rights to avoid a rally site near Native American sites of worship.

I also notice the gender disparity with men on the drums, men in the sweat lodges and men praying. The Jewish / Christian / Muslim religions should be unthinkable for Native Americans. If those religions were true...you as a native american couldn't possibly exist as their Noah's flood would have killed your ancestors. Still with that said there is much room for improvement in the Native American customs regarding the place of women. People speak of women as having equal value but there is a  subtle message when those actually using the site are men.  Having women along with the men as spokes people for these sites is a step forward. Still actions speak louder than words. Watch this again with attention to the clips as to what happens at the site. Does this movie portray the site as a site for either gender equally?  Dont be confused by the scenes showing pow wow dance competitions at other locations. A dance competition is not a religious site. Pow Wows and sacred sites are as different as a  a hip hop dance competition and a site for sacred pilgrimage.

With these things said...I believe it was an important film showing the ongoing conflict with Native and nonnative culture.

The reality is that there are ways to accommodate all. That this is not being done speaks volumes as to how mainstream America views Native Americans.",1426291200,3,5158,4.749440715883669
