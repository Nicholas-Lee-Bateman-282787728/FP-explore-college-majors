In the 1930's, circumnavigating the globe was not commonplace, especially in a 32-foot ketch. Leaving from Seattle and sailing west, Dwight Long filmed his adventure almost entirely on early color film. His narration has been recorded and presents a wonderful perspective on the world he found and the ocean adventures he had so many years ago.

Close Captioned, Black & White and Early Color, 64 minutes.

This is a great video, put out by Mystic Seaport, of Dwight's 6 year trip around the globe in a small sailboat.  The vintage footage is good.  The video was made in 1992 and they took him back to Seattle and filmed him recounting the trip and his experiences, and narrating sections of the film.  He's not as engaging as Captain Johnson, but does a good job anyway, especially considering his age.

Hats off to Dwight for an epic journey, and for having the foresight to film it as he lived it.  Recommended.",1308787200,,933,4.716049382716049
