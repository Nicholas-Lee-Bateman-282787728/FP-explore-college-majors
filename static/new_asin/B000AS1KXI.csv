DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT: The creatively thinking director of an insane asylum allows several inmates to act out their psychotic delusions. When a new staffer arrives, the murder of the director leads to a full-scale takeover of the institution by its inmates.

MEMORIAL VALLEY MASSACRE: A group of campers celebrating Memorial Day weekend at a new campground find horror instead of happiness when a strange, violent valley hermit begins a rampage of death and destruction in revenge for the campers' polluting his valley.

KILL BABY KILL: Stylish horror master Mario Bava creates a tale of suicide victims in a small Transylvania village who turn up with gold coins embedded in their hearts.

THE DEMON: Exploitation and horror master Larry Cohen, known for cult classics like IT'S ALIVE and HELL UP IN HARLEM, presents this mystical murder mystery. A Catholic police detective (Tony Lo Bianco) searches New York City's occult underworld for answers to a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated killings. In a strange twist, it turns out that it's not the murderers themselves he's after.

THE HATCHET MURDERS: An English pianist living in Rome witnesses the brutal hatchet murder of his neighbor, a psychic. With the help of a tenacious young reporter he tries to discover the killer's identity, using very unconventional methods--and the two are soon drawn into a shocking web of dementia, savagery and violence.

PIECES: A chainsaw-wielding madman roams a college campus in search of beautiful young coeds to slash and kill. This secret psycho has a secret of his own: he's collecting human body parts to complete his thesis. His truly original approach to study involves the creation of the world's first flesh jigsaw puzzle!

SILENT NIGHT BLOODY NIGHT: Starring John Carradine and Warhol Factory favorite Mary Woronov, this bizarre tale follows an escaped lunatic who terrorizes a small New England town and has strange dealings with the inhabitants of an old mansion that's up for sale.

NIGHT OF BLOODY HORROR: A string of horrible murders haunts the consciousness of a disturbed young man, including his brother's shooting, the goring of his girlfriend, and a hospital nurse who was bludgeoned to death.

HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB: Scotland Yard begins an investigation that is so terrifying in its outcome, it nearly brings the venerable organization to its knees. It begins with the inquiry into the murder of a young girl and soon evolves into a case surrounding a long forgotten crime, a madman, and zombies.",1289001600,,2587,5.099290780141844
8079284,1,B000AS1KXI,"These 4 movies in my title are great movies except Deep Red and Pieces are way to dark visually to enjoy what so ever as well as Horror Rises From the Tomb. Instead get Deep Red(Dario Agento) remastered on another copy,also Pieces has a new release coming out on DVD(hopefully one that gets cleaned up,again just awful here).Kill Baby Kill(Mario Bava)is one of my favorite Bava films and the picture quality is actually pretty good here,earning the only star on this collection. The other 3 I just mentioned suffer due to the picture quality being horrible(I'm telling you BaBaBaBaaaDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). I'm not going to say much about the other titles because I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes of them. All in all not worth the cheap price because I have seen cheaper copies of Kill Baby Kill for only 2 or 3 bucks here on Amazon. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention Don't Look In the Basement I have this movie on another collection and it looks better there and is worth seeing if your into early 70's sleaze and cheeze.",1220918400,2,1028,4.622950819672131
8079285,3,B000AS1KXI,"Are you a fan of well made, well directed, excellently choreographed, horror movies with a truely frightening story and eye popping special effects?! Well then, you may want to look elsewhere...
Cult Horror Collection is just about the exact opposite of that... Basically it's 9 poorly made, badly directed, non choreographed, grainy slasher flicks all with lame stories and the special effects are limited to crappy looking orange blood flying every which way.

In essence, all the movies in the Cult Horror Collection are cheesy MST3K fodder. Just a bunch of bad movies with mostly bad actors/actresses, terrible and not to mention unfrightening stories, tons of blood & gore, and ""Wake Up Audience!"" scenes throughout. For those of you who can't guess what I'm talking about, a ""Wake Up Audience!"" scene is one in which pointless nudity suddenly & 9 times out of 10 inexplicably happens. An attempt most likely, to wake the audience from the slumber that the movie before that scene had caused.

In other words, Cult Horror Collection is still worth buying for it's overall cheese factor, but don't buy it expecting a truely frightening horror movie experience.

With that said, order the collection, call some of your buddies over who have nothing better to do on a Friday night, pop in one of the DVDs and have fun making fun out of the movie with your friends as though you were Mike Nelson, Joel, Crow T. Robot, Gypsy, and Tom Sirvo because that's the most enjoyment you're going to get out of this collection.",1206489600,,1517,4.872093023255814
8079286,3,B000AS1KXI,"There are better cult collection being sold, but if you are like me and like campy movies you will enjoy cult horror collection.",1190505600,2,128,4.608695652173913
8079287,3,B000AS1KXI,"Let me start by saying that if you aren't a big fan of cheap slasher movies you'll want to skip this 3-disc collection. But if you're entertained by grainy-looking low-budget horror movies with bad acting, loads of blood/gore, and pointless nudity, then you should get this inexpensive set. The picture and sound quality are below adverage in most of the films but hey, you get what you pay for.

Disc 1 contains ""Don't Look in the Basement"" (aka The Forgotten), ""Memorial Valley Massacre,"" and ""Kill Baby Kill"", as well as some old horror movie trailers with poor picture quality.

1973's ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a budget-less, so-bad-it's-good camp classic from 1973 about a strange asylum for the criminally insane where the patients are allowed to act out their fantasies. Let's see, there's the motherly psycho who constantly clutches a doll, there's a crazy sergeant who's still fighting a war, there's a demented axe murderer, and various other freaks roaming around the place. It isn't long before the loonies totally snap and begin a bloody massacre!

""Memorial Valley Massacre"" is yet another ultra-cheap summer camp massacre movie from the 1980's. This time it's a caveman (!) who terrorizes and slaughters the campers. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad special effects, bad music, bad hairdos, bad movie. Except for a scene with a hot babe in a wet t-shirt. Oh yeah.

""Kill Baby Kill"" (1966) is a Mario Bava gem about a town that's haunted by the ghost of a seven-year-old witchcraft victim. Plus there's a murderer who leaves gold coins jammed into the hearts of his victims. Yep, typical fun from Mario Bava!

Disc 2 contains ""The Demon"", ""The Hatchet Murders"", and ""Pieces"", as well as a brief featurette: ""Filming Our Secret Fears.""

1979's ""The Demon"" is a dreadful movie about a stalker who terrorizes and murders women. The killer doesn't appear to have a motive, so the investigators use a man with ESP (Cameron Mitchell) to help them understand what kind of psycho they're looking for. Ugh. Wake me when it's over...

1975's ""The Hatchet Murders"" (aka ""Deep Red"") is one of Dario Argento's best movies. A psychic is murdered after she reads the mind of a killer, and then an English pianist (David Hemmings) starts his own investigation of the case, but before long he's investigating a whole string of brutal murders, all done by the same elusive killer who continually remains one step ahead of the police. An exceptional thriller.

""Pieces"" is a Spanish slasher flick from 1982 about a madman armed with a chainsaw that likes to dismember beautiful co-eds at a New England campus. The typical bad acting and dialogue is aided by generous amounts of nudity and gore, including one scene where a bathing beauty gets ""chainsawed"" in half! Definitely worth watching if you love slasher movies.

Disc 3 contains ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"", ""Night of Bloody Horror"", and ""Horror Rises From the Tomb"", as well as a brief biography of B horror movie star John Carradine.

1974's ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"" is a mediocre movie with a totally wasted John Carradine (he never says one line, I guess he plays a ""mute"" guy). It's about an old house that holds some very dark secrets, and when a serial killer takes refuge there, the town panics with fear. Nice idea, but a muddled movie at best.

""Night of Bloody Horror"" from 1969 is about a former mental patient who has a bad habit of hacking up his ex-girlfriends with a meat cleaver. Sounds great, I know, but trust me it's not very memorable.

""Horror Rises From the Tomb"" from 1973 is an entertaining tale of a medieval knight who's beheaded and then comes back to life centuries later to possess people and make them sacrifice themselves. Not bad at all for a low-budget Spanish horror film.

Well, there you have it. A very mixed bag of mostly Spanish or Italian horror flicks from the 1970's. Overall, I'd say this is definitely worth getting if you are a hardcore horror fanatic. It's a good way to ""kill"" 13+ hours, and I guarantee you'll be sick and tired of fake orange blood by the time you're through with these movies!",1134432000,50,4104,4.8125
