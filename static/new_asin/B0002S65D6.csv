8031068,1,B0002S65D6,"I purchased this film because it said it came with English subtitles. When I put it in though, I found it to be poor video quality and it lacked the subtitles. I tried to play it on my laptop and DVD player to see if either would work but it kept saying that the DVD doesn't have English subtitles as an option. I wanted to show it to my boyfriend who doesn't know Spanish and now this purchase has proved to be pointless..

Not pleased.",1379462400,,437,4.141176470588236
