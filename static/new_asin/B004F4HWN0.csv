4368095,2,B004F4HWN0,"Die hard Dinosaur fans, especially kids, may get something out of seeing these gigantic South American prehistoric animals on screen, and I've no doubt in 3-D and on an IMAX the experience would have been stunning, but of dubious use at home.  The BBC, Impossible Pictures, and Framestore (the folks responsible for the award winning ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and its follow ups) have truly set the standard to be matched and exceeded.  This documentary falls flat by comparison.

Poor Dr. Rodolfo Coria sounds like he was forced to ""read"" his dialogue from the director/writers, instead of giving us his TRUE insights.  Much of the program follows his travels and fossil collecting, in addition to fly overs and shots of Patagonia.  Few dinosaur species are featured, recieving even less screen time.  Mr. Donald Sutherland's narration is clumsy and un-inspiring, again blame put squarely on the writing staff.

Approval for the effort can be found in the animation, which is not equal to the best...but close enough.  I found the ""look"" and apperance of the Giganotosaurus in paticular to be the most correct, perhaps the closest animation so far to what I would expect the living animal to really look like.  Kudos to Dr. Coria and his work with the animators on that front!

The Cretaceous of South America, Patagonia in paticular, is a prehistoric tale worth telling and I fully hoped ""Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia"" would accomplish that task, but be prepared for disappointment.  This was created solely for 3-D and IMAX, not for home entertainment or information.  Perhaps some ambitious documentary team will do justice to the work of South America's paleontologists and the remarkable Cretaceous world of 90 million years ago?",1299974400,3,1736,5.117021276595745
4368096,1,B004F4HWN0,"Because Blu Ray 3D is so new to the home theater format there aren't a lot of movies being released steadily. So I pick up anything that comes out so I can make use of my 3D setup.  I have a Sony Bravia LED/LCD and although I have some ghosting in almost every movie I watch, it's never been too distracting.  Until now.  This disc is unwatchable.  Every time a live person is on screen there are 3 of them - spread far apart - and the crosstalk is horrible.  You seriously cannot watch this disc because it is such a mess.  Some people say that it's subjective to your system setup, and I am not going to disagree, however I own every 3D release from Image Entertainment and for the most part they are all very good.  The Ultimate Wave Tahiti is ASTOUNDING in both the BD quality and the 3D presentation.  So it's not my setup for this disc.  It's the horrible transfer.

Definitely rent before you buy if possible. I ended up watching it in 2D and while it was enjoyable, it was meant for 3D.  I'd rather put on the old blue/red glasses and sit through it as I am sure it would have less ghosting and crosstalk.",1299542400,11,1113,4.202830188679245

4368099,1,B004F4HWN0,"While the subject matter is interesting, I was very disappointed with this documentary. The 3D version suffered from large amounts of ghosting.

4368100,2,B004F4HWN0,"Are the the people reviewing this getting paid to write positive reviews? I mean come on people if I didn't pay less than 10 bucks for this it would be laughable.  Now is it horrible, no I've experienced worse in the 3d realm but is it anything great, heeeck nooooo. First off what did they do,  cover a total of 5 dinosaurs throughout the entire movie? I mean it's awful, as for some of the scenery Yea that was nice,  but I purchased a movie on dinosaurs not on the layout of Patagonia.

4368102,4,B004F4HWN0,... Real good matching between cgi & real aerial shots ... natural blends makes it very reallistic . The dinosaur kept under roof is an amazingly painstaking well done task . The real full scale footprints are awesomenly intact . I visited the Patagonia & indeed is a vast aweinspiring land.

4368126,3,B004F4HWN0,"This film was OK.  The CGI was fine and up to standards, but there was too much panning from airplanes as they swooped over landscape.  None of that added to the film.  There were also too many scenes of paleontologists either talking to each other or looking contemplatively at the landscape.  Also, while this is a common issue, when the CGI covered the dinosaurs, the animals were often walking past grass.  Overall, this was an average effort on the part of the filmmakers.",1410998400,2,477,4.698795180722891

4368138,4,B004F4HWN0,Dinosaurs:  Giants of Patagonia was a different approach to your average dinosaur documentary.

4368139,4,B004F4HWN0,This is an excellent portrayal of the history of the dinosaur. A lot of good scene shots excellent dinosaur animation. Has some dry spots however very educational.

4368143,2,B004F4HWN0,"The documentary speaks primarily of only two species of dinosaur with scant mention of any others.

There are about 7 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 5 at 25% and 5 more insignificant effects extended to 30%.

Like most IMAX films, this one also has large differences between right and left views. The live footage 3D had the parallax pushed to the limit often and exceeded it a few times. The CG scenes are even worse. More sensitive people may feel eye strain or get headaches from watching this movie. However, if the 3D in other IMAX films were OK for you, this one should be too.

Active Glasses Users: 19 instances of crosstalk with 11 of them being pretty bad. (on my system)

MY 3D RATING = FAIR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

Other than that little item the 3D was stellar. I use Samsung equipment. I can't wait to see a full length documentary on Dinosaurs without the (real) human aspect added to the documentary. Overall this 3D documentary had no artifacts I found annoying. The sound was great... the picture stellar.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: With this IMAX  DINOSAURS: GIANTS OF PATAGONIA 3D film that is narrator by Donald Sutherland, informs us that if it were not for a series of cataclysmic events; a comet impact being first on the list, our planet could well still be the domain of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs fascinate us so much, that many people wish they were amongst us. Fortunately, the large format presentation 3D IMAX of the Dinosaurs will be the closest thing to actually being in the presence of the extraordinary creatures without looking into our own extinction at the same time.

Following Palaeontologist Rodolfo Coria, a world-renown Argentinian palaeontologist, we visit sites of major discoveries he has contributed to in Patagonia and travel back in time to see these amazing beasts come to life. Patagonia has given us the largest living animal to have ever walked the Earth: the titanesque plant-eating Argentinosaur, and its nemesis, the Giganotosaurus, a bipedal carnivore, that could easily  challenge the famous T-Rex.

This documentary-style narrative focuses on the history, evolution and extinction of the dinosaurs. In larger-than-life fashion, audiences will explore a subject matter whose mystique and appeal are unquestioned. Deeply rooted in science, the 3D IMAX film carries the audience through the lives of two specimens of these superb achievements of history. The action is intense and the landscape is out of this world. At times, the camera takes us into space to witness the movement of the tectonic plates or the arrival of a comet that will seal the fate of the Dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs are amongst the most fascinating animals to have ever walked the Earth. We are captivated by their enormous size and intrigued by the fact that they disappeared millions of years ago. DINOSAURS: GIANTS OF PATAGONIA  3D IMAX film will take audiences on an unprecedented and  unique 3D IMAX journey into the world of the largest known dinosaurs and, in the process, explore some of the great paleontological discoveries of modern time.

The special effects are very well executed in this IMAX 3D film. It seemed as if the dinosaurs were close enough to eat me on more than one occasion. And when some birds are seen on screen, you feel as if you can reach out and touch them. The scenes filmed in Argentina are very beautiful. The scientific knowledge shared in this film is fascinating which may or may not be news to some viewers. There are small titbits of information telling us that some dinosaurs having walked on two legs and some on four. Even a new discovery of a specific species of dinosaurs is mentioned. The size of most of the dinosaur eggs being just larger than grape-fruit size was a very interesting titbit.

I noted that the subject of evolution is mentioned twice and some viewers will not agree with this teaching. However, the subject is not dwelt on by the filmmakers and the 3D IMAX film is very entertaining to watch as well as educational, especially for young children. But there are scenes where there is a bit of blood as some dinosaurs fight each other, but there is not much and I feel parents should view this 3D IMAX film with their children to assure them it is not real, as some children might get upset with the violence they view, thinking it is all real.

Blu-ray 3D Image Quality  Image Entertainment, Inc., brings you this 3D IMAX 65 mm film format in something that always looks absolutely staggering on the big screen in terms of detail. In terms of this Blu-ray disc, the 1080p resolution is as good as you would expect from this Blu-ray format, and the 1.78:1 aspect ratio helps to enhance the image presentation. In this IMAX feature is expertly produced, combining gorgeous footage of the Patagonia landscape along with highly-convincing computer generated renditions of monstrous dinosaurs that look mostly realistic. The 3D presentation is top-shelf.  With a sharp sense of separation, and you find yourself in yet another 3D IMAX picture window journey through gorgeous landscapes that look amazing in its dimensionality.  The 3D IMAX film has a crisp and well detailed transfer; you can't help but sit back and be drawn into the panorama that immerses you.  There are lots of sequences involving various species of dinosaurs both on the ground and flying above. You will appreciate the 3D rendering that has these creatures poking their noses out of the screen and hurdling small rocks in your direction as a herd passes through. The manipulation of scale is tremendous, too. This 3D IMAX film must have been something awesome to see up on the big-big screen.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Sky High Entertainment and Image Entertainment, Inc., brings you this 3D IMAX 65 mm film format that is in the awesome 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience. But as I say that with the 3D presentation that is top notch, with the audio presentation you get a sharp sense of enhanced separation of sounds, and with the 3D IMAX image presentation, the journey through gorgeous landscapes adds amazing dimensionality the surround sound presentation. We get a warning specifies ""very large, very loud"" critters and they are not kidding. From the Giganotosaurus and Argentinosaurus on down, they are mightily represented in not only in surround but backed by adequate bass to bring the awe, particularly in their footsteps. The rear speakers get plenty of activity be it prehistoric fish swimming around us, a meteorite tumbling by, predators scurrying off behind us, pterodactyl fly-bys or even a 360-degree bug-a-saurus showing off via all of your speakers.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Lizard Kings [2009] [1080] [1.78:1] [43:18] This special feature introduces us to Graham Cuthbertson, who is the main Host and Narrator who takes us on a journey and focuses on the 3D IMAX shoot, especially on the location filming in Argentine and the Patagonia area, and working with the latest in 3D IMAX digital technology. The special feature looks at some light-hearted dinosaur trivia, a brief look at the other works of Director Marc Fafard, and the challenges of bringing ancient history to life onto the big screen and in three dimensions. We also get colourful sequences that helps offset the dry narrative tone and the slower stretches in which we observe real-life palaeontologist Rodolfo Coria at work uncovering the fossils from which much of this historical data is derived. It is interesting stuff, of course, watching this diligent explorer about his meticulous work. Director Marc Fafard takes his massive 3D IMAX camera anywhere it can possibly go in order to capture dynamic views of Argentina's most primitive regions. Dizzying shots glide slowly over the landscape, often directly into the frame. The CGI dinosaurs are extremely well-integrated into these settings. Contributors include: Rodolfo Coria [Palaeontologist], Marc Fafard [Writer/Director], William Reeve, C.S.C. [Director of Photography], Richard Bergeron [Art Director] and Martin LHeureux [Animation Director].

IMAX Blu-ray Trailers: Here we get to view the following IMAX trailers for the Blu-ray format, and as a bonus you get to view one of them in the 3D format and they are as follows: THE ALPS: CLIMB OF YOUR LIFE [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:31]; GRAND CAYNON ADVENTURE: RIVER AT RISK [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:44]; HURRICANE ON THE BAYOU [2007] [1080p]  [1.78:1] [1:35]; JOURNEY INTO AMAZING CAVES [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:25]; VOLCANOES OF THE DEEP SEA [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:49]; DINOSAURS: GIANTS OF PATAGONIA 3D [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:32] and ADRENLANINE RUSH: THE SCIENCE OF RISK [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:38]. As usual, you can either watch each IMAX Trailer separately or Play All.

Special Feature: BD-LIVE: BD-Live is a feature of new Blu-ray 2.0 that allows the user to connect to the Internet and download extra features that gives additional dynamicHD content and even copies the contents for their PSP game console. To view these extra features, your Blu-ray player has to be connected to the internet and especially make sure the latest firmware has been installed.

Finally, if you like your dinosaurs big and bold and hey, who doesnt, then you are in for a real treat and at the same time you will love the latest IMAX 3D documentary, IMAX  DINOSAURS: GIANTS OF PATAGONIA 3D that follows Palaeontologist Rodolfo Coria as he tramps the rugged wilds of Patagonia in Southern Argentina, and the site of the largest dinosaur finds, that is, finds of the largest dinosaurs in the world. Done in close collaboration with the foremost scientists of the domain, the movie will show never seen before computer generated footage of the Giganotosaurus and the Argentinosaurus to name a few. Writer-director Marc Fafard does not tell us much about dinosaurs that a well-informed youngster mightnt already know, though it does take some work to get your mind around the idea of a 120-foot Argentinosaurus. Fortunately, Marc Fafard does not leave it to our imaginations, supplying convincing CGI behemoths to lumber around us, brushing the edges of your 3D glasses and rattling our teeth with its seismic thunder of their sequoia-size legs. At the moment of initiating this extraordinary project, one question comes to mind, and that is IMAX  DINOSAURS: GIANTS OF PATAGONIA 3D film is a great deal of educational fun, set via the stately narration of the soothing voice of Donald Sutherland. Highly Recommended!
