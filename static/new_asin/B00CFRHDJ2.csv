5721818,5,B00CFRHDJ2,I have enjoyed all of Pastor Mark's teachings and that the feasts are not Jewish feasts- these are the LORD'S feasts.  Jesus and the Holy Spirit fulfilled according to the Word the spring feasts of Passover and Pentecost and the second coming will fulfill the fall feasts and we are living in that time.  God has set these special appointments to meet with us.,1394841600,3,360,4.609375
5721819,4,B00CFRHDJ2,The quality of the recording is not great but i didn't buy it for that.  For the value of the informaton I give in 10 out of 5 stars!,1393459200,2,133,3.586206896551724
5721820,5,B00CFRHDJ2,"The information is very enlightening.  It helps shows how the Feasts foreshadowed Christ's coming.
An important way of showing the connection of the Old and New Testaments.",1390262400,2,172,5.37037037037037
5721821,5,B00CFRHDJ2,It went beyond my expectations and gave great revelations about the Jewish Feasts that definitely pointed to Jesus Christ of Nazareth as the Messiah of Israel.,1387152000,4,159,5.153846153846154
5721822,5,B00CFRHDJ2,"Fantastic DVD which I viewed many times.  Something is about to happen. There is currently a book out by John Hagee - it's in Kindle store Four Blood Moons - check that out.

You'll enjoy all.  Joe",1383264000,2,197,4.27027027027027
8581410,5,B00CFRHDJ2,I'm so glad that Mark is a vessel for the Lord. The DVD set contains a wealth of very important information for today's Christian to understand what the Lord is doing on the biblical calendar.,1515974400,,192,4.514285714285714

8581416,5,B00CFRHDJ2,"Wow ! You will want to watch them more than once and season after season.  Mark's video is great for Christians who are ""coming out"" of Easter (Spring Equinox) and Christmas (Winter Solstice)... and wanting to know what Christ, Yeshuah, did. I have watched the 119 Ministries and Passion for Truth versions, which are more recent and I recommend as well to see more than one viewpoint, BUT Mark's presentation is thorough and mature. It was filmed 15 years ago, but don't let that deter you into buying one from someone else who is more ""recent"" with ""flashy"" graphics. Mark's teaching is amazing just the way it is. It has really opened my family's eyes. Great for the entire family, children, and adults.",1439078400,,706,4.739837398373984
8581417,5,B00CFRHDJ2,Amazing the things you learn.  One of the most important teachings I have ever heard in my life.  God is truely amazing....I look forward to the coming years.  Mark Biltz is a blessed man of God.,1425772800,2,195,4.361111111111111
8581418,5,B00CFRHDJ2,"Want to understand Biblical prophecy?  Get a fundamental understanding of the Feasts!  The Spring Feasts represent Jesus first coming, and the Fall Feasts represent his second coming!  Sadly the Church ignores the feasts for fear of going legalistic, understood, but you should know the feats from a Biblical horizontal timeline!  The next feast to be fulfilled is Feats of Trumpets!  Perhaps one day we'll soon hear that trumpet sound!  (I Thes 4:16-17)!",1414886400,3,455,5.25
