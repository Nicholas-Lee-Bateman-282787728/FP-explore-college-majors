1247189,5,B00001W0G3,"The sequel to the original Val Lewton horror film, ""Cat People"" is disappointing in that it doesn't follow up on the growl-slash-bite were-cat premise at all (opting, instead, to stick to the ""it was all in her head"" version of the story).  Otherwise, though, this one's a winner.  Kent Smith reprises his role as the all-too-rational modern man, Mr. Reed, who is now a husband and father, having married the ""other woman"" from the previous film, Jane Randolph.  Things are just peachy, except that their daughter has somehow picked up on the weird vibe that plagues their family, and becomes psychically linked to what appears to be the ghost of the dead cat lady from the first film (played again by Simone Simon.)  The drearily sensible, scientific-psychological perspective dukes it out with the fantastical-supernatural viewpoint: we the audience are encouraged to root for the ghost story explanation, as the filmmakers provide some brilliant, spooky visual cues to accompany the little girl's altered state of mind.  Young actor Ann Carter is quite good as the daughter.  Not your standard-issue horror movie, yet very definitely recommended!

1247190,3,B00001W0G3,"Nothing to do with any Cat people of any sort. It is a nicely made film about the love of a father for his previous wife and for his daughter. This girl is more or less mesmerized by the ghost of the previous wife, who will protect her against some real danger. It is a moral lesson about loving children and accepting their ranting and raving as some kind of message about their lack of love or their desire for love. But be careful with kids. Curiosity kills the cat, or at least may kill the cat, even if here the cat, or the kitten, is nicely saved from its unavoidable end of freezing to death or choking in the hands of some bitter woman.

1247191,5,B00001W0G3,"'Cat People' is a horror film.  'The Curse of the Cat People' is a fantasy, an exploration of a child's imagination.  The first film focused on Oliver Reed (Kent Smith), who marries a woman named Irena.  Irena is cursed with the supernatural ability to turn into a cat when angered.  This deadly ability causes the detoriation of her happy marriage, the death of a man, as well as hers.  This movie begins years after the first, Oliver is now married and has a six-year old daughter named Amy.  Her imagination and belief in the fantastic triggers her fathers memories of Irena and her ""mental delusion,"" as it is addressed in this film.  We are left to ponder whether Irena really was cursed, or whether it was just a mental delusion of hers.  Oliver does everything to suppress his daughter's fertile imagination, but this only causes the alienation of Oliver from his daughter.  This is when Amy calls for a friend, and she gets one in the form of Irena (Simone Simon).
Is it Divine intervention?  Or is it all in Amy's imagination?
'The Curse of the Cat People' is a touching and ethereal film.  Great directing, well-built suspense, chilling atmosphere, wonderful script, great acting (especially from the young girl), and unforgettable and haunting visuals (Irena caroling in the distance, Amy at Sleepy Hollow, etc.)  This film has nothing to do with cats, or cat people.  It never specifies the ""mental delusion"" Irena Reed had in the first film.  The title is very misleading.  Great movie.",1030147200,22,1499,4.823529411764706

So amazing to hear how it was sneaked into existence using ""Curse of Cat People"" title studio execs would think they were funding a horror film!  In roundabout ways the plot and its message does relate to the original 1942 ""Cat People"":  the first film is about a woman who is a social outcast.  In sequel this character returns to befriend a little girl who is herself an outcast.  This film does seem to have escaped wide attention due to the misleading title.  The little girl's performance is unbelievably convincing and will move you to tears.  Somehow this oddball movie gets to the heart of the universal heartbreak of childhood.  Not to be missed!",1009065600,,750,4.944
1247194,5,B00001W0G3,"As others here have noted, and as anyone who has seen this wonderful film is aware, the title (meant by the studio to cash in on producer Val Lewton's and writer Dewitt Bodeen's earlier success, ""Cat People"") is misleading, exploitive and wildly inappropriate.
While this is a tenuous sequel to ""Cat People"", the 1942 tale of sexual awakening/fear, the only real connection it has to that movie is the lurid title and a few characters. Occuring some years after the events of the first film, ""Curse of the Cat People"" finds introverted young Amy (played with wide eyed perfection by Ann Carter) discovering that the fantasy world she inhabits does not meet the approval of her parents (Kent Smith and Jane Randolph from the first movie) because she spends too much time alone and, in fact, that it sometimes clashes with the real world - as when she attempts to deliver birthday party invitations via a magic tree rather than a post box.
Relations with her concerned (and, I think, narrow minded) father do not improve when Amy makes a new ""imaginary"" friend of his dead first wife (the otherworldly Simone Simon, killed in the first movie). She also befriends an aged former actress (Julia Dean) while simultaneously gaining the resentment of the old lady's smoldering, alienated daughter (Elizabeth Russell).
This is not a horror film in any sense (except for the horrible title, of course), but more a magical realist coming of age story. A sense of suspense and wonder permeates the film, thanks to producer Val Lewton's celebrated use of light and shadow and the brisk direction of Robert Wise (his directorial debut if I'm not mistaken) and Gunther von Fritsch.
Not a horror movie, I repeat, but without doubt one of the best films about the wonders and terrors of childhood ever produced.",1008201600,16,1795,4.869281045751634
1247195,5,B00001W0G3,"CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE is one of those movies that begs to be seen a number of times to be fully appreciated.  Even if the story were absolute garbage -- it isn't -- the visuals alone captivate and entertain on a grand scale.  Val Lewton, who made a mark in the horror genre by creating moody and atmospheric thrillers, does it again here, thanks in no small part, no doubt, to co-director Robert Wise's helming (Gunther von Fritsch shares directing credits).  Seldom is light and shadow used this effectively in film.  New students of cinema should study this picture in order to learn to create truly magical and uneasy moments simply through the use of light and shadow.
I hadn't watched this movie in a while but I just wrapped up another screening on a dark and gloomy fall evening here in New England.  The film is set in Tarrytown and it truly captures the moody atmosphere of its location through a variety of seasons.
More important, CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE succeeds in capturing childhood on celluloid.  It is the story of a lonely and misunderstood little girl whose biggest crime, it seems, is having an overly imaginative soul.  Enter the stunning Simone Simon as ethereal companion to the child.  I think this film succeeds so well because it seldom drifts far from the point of view of the child and the emotions that are running through her system:  loneliness, isolation, insecurity, the first realizations that sometimes ""life just even fair"" (she gets punished for telling the truth) and other childhood themes are explored here, and very effectively translated via the talents of Ann Carter.
Producer Val Lewton grudgingly agreed to the title if RKO allowed him the opportunity to do a follow-up to his successful CAT PEOPLE.  He refused to further compromise his principles, however, especially when it came to the story.  It's really too bad that this beautiful fantasy isn't known by another title.  I'm sure if it were called just about anything other than CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE, it would by known by a much greater audience.",1006646400,6,2052,4.781869688385269
1247196,5,B00001W0G3,"I just wrote a review for ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls"" mentioning ""Curse"" as a deleted title. Apparently it's not; cos' here it is. Why did I talk about ""Mrs. Carrolls"" ?. -Well, that one also  features the superb Ann Carter. She's perfect here; they could not have  found a better actress. She's in nearly every scene (not surprisingly since  the film's really about her),  and completely steals the show from all the  adults. Jane Randolph and Kent Smith (as the parents) reprise their roles  from ""Cat People"", but they're merely shadows here. Simone Simon  returns from the grave, to play with the lonely and isolated little Amy.  Lewton regular Elizabeth Russell was also in ""Cat People"", but in  a different part apparently. -Although that character was never really  explained, so I suppose somehow it could actually be the same character;  out to ""curse"" again. (I know it's probably not the case, but  think about it; it's not impossible). Whatever, this is one eerie and  spooky movie. It's filled with memorable, and atmospheric scenes. I love  it. Actually, it's not just a Horror film, but a touching and moving story  about a misunderstood child. And if it weren't for that misplaced title,  I'm sure more people would see it. I highly recommend it anyway, you won't  be disappointed if you're into the good old style of movie-making.  Actually, I think TV should show it every year around christmas; please  demand it and make it a tradition wherever you can. -It's not just a  wonderful movie which will suit the season, there's a message in it as  well: listen to children with invisible playmates.

1247197,4,B00001W0G3,"A curiously touching and atmospheric film. Don't expect any people changing into cats or vice-versa. The movie evokes a stifling domesticity reminiscent of growing up in the 50's (must have been true of some families in the 40's as well). The little girl Amy, beautifully portrayed by seven year-old Ann Carter, can't satisfy the demands of her decently concerned but pretentious parents. Everything Mommy and Daddy do, however well-intentioned, somehow rings false. Nor does little Amy  fit in with the conventionally rambunctious kids in her kindergarten class. She escapes into a relationship with a fantasy woman- either the ghost of her father's first wife, or a product of the child's unconscious, depending on how literally you take the story. There's some amusingly earnest Freudian and Jungian psychobabble thrown in for good measure, when the kid's teacher lectures the father on how to be a better friend to his child. Plus there's an old woman and a haunted house that have nothing much to do with the main plot. Also a Jamaican butler (played by an at-the-time famous calypso singer called Sir Lancelot). How did this courtly West Indian man end up working for a middle-class family supposedly living in Tarrytown, N.Y.? Was Tarrytown chosen as a fictional location solely to allow the legend of the Headless Horseman sporadically to intrude on the main action? Never mind. It all somehow fits into a finished whole. One of the last shots, where the old woman's frustrated adult daughter intends to kill little Amy but then softens at the last moment is very delicately handled and quite affecting.  Great black and white photography and fine editing too. There are moments when the pacing and camera angles reminded me of HItchcock's movie, The Birds",1475625600,,1764,5.0793103448275865

Yes, it's a ghost story of sorts, but not scary or threatening, more like a guardian angel element. Don't want to spoil the story, but by ending I get the feeling it's all about how love has the power to save & transform, even tho that's never brought up in words, the ending is especially relevant.

1247206,5,B00001W0G3,"Producer Val Lewton was forced to work with a small budget during his time with RKO, but faced with financial constraints and lack of star power, he hooked up with director Jacques Tourneur to create several horror films that many decades later are still considered the finest ever made in the genre. ""Cat People"" is one of those films.

While ""Curse of the Cat People"" often gets lumped with these horror classics, this Robert Wise directed film is more fantasy and mood than horror. This exploration of a child's world is both sensitive and affecting. ""Cat People"" is a wonderful horror classic, and while this film has always been marketed as a sequel due to that film's success, it could not be any more different, and is no less memorable.

Both Kent Smith and Jane Randolph return in this quasi-sequel but it is young Ann Carter as their daughter Amy who is at the center of this film. The memory of the tormented Irena hovers over every frame. Once again the anguished elegance of Simone Simon becomes a presence in the life of Reed when his young daughter Amy begins to retreat into a world of her own. But it may be more than mere fantasy despite her loving father's refusal to believe.

There is a magical and somewhat haunting feel to this exploration of a child's mind and what is real and what is not. Just as in ""Cat People"" where you ached to believe in the curse surrounding Irena (Simone Simon), Lewton and Wise create a bridge between Amy's imagination and Irena's presence we want desperately to believe in. This is a very special film with a mood unlike the horror films Lewton made. It stands on its own, however, and should not be dismissed.

While quite different in tone and with a distinctly different atmosphere than the original, ""Curse of the Cat People"" is an excellent example of how great cinema can become when story and filmmaking technique are used to capture the viewer in its world. That world in this instance, is that of a child. An excellent film.",1211932800,2,1986,4.61756373937677

We have seen the formula before but you may not have seen such a presentation; a lonely child Amy Reed (Ann Carter) seeks a playmate that understands her. Who best but the spirit of Oliver's dead wife, Irena (Simone Simon) one of the cat people. Naturally this upsets the parents.

Toss in Amy's new relation to reclusive neighbor Julia Farren (Julia Dean). Julia has problems of her own relating to her daughter. The story just gets complex from there.

The question is, is it dangerous to fantasize that much and what will become of the characters in the end.",1505347200,,798,4.598591549295775
7914955,4,B00001W0G3,"Certainly this should have been named ""Amy and Her Friend"" as Lewton wished. It has nothing to do with the original Cat People story line outside of the three actors (Kent Smith, Simone Simon, and Jane Randolph) who play in this film as well.

It's not a horror film but a psychological study of a sweet, lonely, imaginative little girl, played wonderfully by the seven year old child actress Ann Carter. Miss Carter is so believable in her role, showing a patient, poised poignancy beyond her years, due in great part to the fact her mother coached her on the meaning of her lines so she might approach with an understanding of what the plot was meant to portray. From what we view on screen, this dear little girl took her mother's suggestions to heart, quite literally.

Irena (Simone Simon) appears as a beautiful fairy-like ghost and makes friends with the outcast Amy. As one in a long line of imaginary friends, Amy's father Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) scolds her for lying and berates her to make friends with the neighborhood children. Alice Reed (Jane Randolph) is more understanding of her six year old daughter, and urges her husband to show more sympathy. A kind, capable housekeeper Edward (Sir Lancelot) also shows empathy towards this strange little girl, believing as he does in the unseen himself.

Amy visits the dark, heavily Gothic, Victorian home of her neighbors the Farrens, where Julia (Julia Dean) a retired stage actress, and her daughter Barbara (Elizabeth Russell in a chilling performance) live in isolation. Amy is gifted a ring by Julia, which Edward determines to be a ""wishing ring.""

This ring becomes a catalyst for change within the characters in this story. For despite the opinion of Miss Callahan (Eve March), Amy's kindergarten teacher, there are some things that cannot be neatly categorized, or pigeonholed by science.

7914957,4,B00001W0G3,"In the tradition of Aliens, Evil Dead 2, and Halloween III, Curse of the Cat People is a sequel that radically diverges from the original film. Where Cat People was a horror film about a woman who descended from people who could transform themselves into, well, a giant species of cat, Curse of the Cat People changes gear by eschewing most of the originals horror film trappings and instead becoming a family drama about children and their imaginary friends. While some people might say to themselves, I watched the entire movie, and not one person turned into a damn cat! Curse of the Cat People actually serves as a worthwhile follow up to the original, and the genre hopping only reinforces the fact that this is a thoughtful and unique picture that stands on its own.

 In the original film, Oliver Reed, a dopey middle class striver, marries a woman from Eastern Europe, Irena, who comes to believe she is descended from people endowed with the ability to transform into giant cats. Irena slowly loses her mind as her husband begins to strike up a romance with his coworker, Alice. By the end of the film, Irna dies, but not before transforming into a panther and killing her therapist.

 Curse of the Cat People moves its characters from the city to the suburbs. Years later, Oliver is living in a house and now married to Alice, his coworker from the first film, and the two of them have a six-year-old daughter, Amy. Amy is estranged from her fellow schoolmates because she spends most of her time daydreaming. She knows that shes different from other children, and on her birthday, Amy wishes that she could be normal just like other children.

 Like many films after Curse, Amys childhood alienation is demonstrated by the fact that her classmates do not show up for her birthday party. But in a twist on what has become a trope, its not that the other children are purposefully avoiding her. Rather, Amy never mailed the invitation, instead stuffing them into a gnarled tree that she imaginatively transforms into a mailbox. Its not that other children don't avoid Amy--the film doesnt shy away from the cruelty of kids--but on some level I think that Amy wants to be alone. Like any creative person, sometimes its easier to escape into fantasy than to be around others.

 Eventually, Amy starts to have visions of an imaginary friend who looks just like her fathers first wife, Irena the Feline-American. And yet its not clear whether or not Irena supernaturally appears to Amy or if the vision is only in her head. Before seeing Irena, Amy uncovers photographs of her that Oliver keeps around, and her presence metaphorically haunts the home in the form of one of her paintings that Oliver still keeps around. This naturally makes Olivers current wife uneasy.

 Amy also strikes up a friendship with a former actress, Julia Farron, who is now an elderly woman shut up in her creepy home with her adult daughter. Julia and Amy form a natural pair because both are interested in the world of make believe, but Julia also represents what happens when you find yourself too invested in the unreal. Julia has developed an unhealthy belief that her daughter, who has sacrificed much of her own life to care for her aging mother, is not really her daughter. Perhaps a sign of increased dementia, but almost certainly tied to her career as an actress, Julia believes her actual daughter died when she was six and that this woman who now takes care of her is somehow an imposter.

 Curse wonderfully recreates the imaginative world of children. Amy finds a place of her own in the familys backyard, a site of imagination. In fact, the backyard is referred to as a garden, which connotes a place of play and fantasy, a location where fairies might exist. Like the imagination, a garden is both wild and cultivated, containing plants that would not naturally appear in our backyards. Its no coincidence that gardens have become metaphors for imagination in childrens literature as we can see in classics like Frances Hodgson Burnetts The Secret Garden.

 The directors, Gunther Von Fritsch and Robert Wise (more on them later), capture a childs fantasy world. The one technique that I found particularly reminiscent from my own childhood is how brief shadows of clouds portend the arrival of the fantastic. I remember feeling a bit of a chill and a bit of wonder whenever a cloud would pass over a field I was playing in. For a moment, time seemed to stop, and I found myself looking around to see if anything around me had suddenly changed. This obviously come out of the overactive imagination of a child, but Curse suggests that I wasn't the only child who took a passing cloud as a symbol for the supernatural.

 Curse could easily stand on its own, apart from the original film. Without the first Cat People, I think most would read the appearance of Irena as solely the work of Amys imagination. At one point, Amy is told by her father that she must denounce Irenas presence or suffer the consequences, which means he will spank her. This is referred to as a special occasion because its the first time Amy has had to endure physical punishment for misbehaving. (People sure were accepting of parents hitting their children in the 1940s).

While Oliver is smacking his child, Alice has a conversation with Amys teacher. (In another exchange that reminds us the film is made in the 1940s, Amys teacher is reminded that she doesnt have children of her own, likely because if she did, she would be a housewife and no longer working.) The teacher reminds Alice that its healthy for children to have imaginary friends and that this is a phase that she will grow out of. She then quotes a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson on the subject, titled The Unseen Playmate. When Amy starts to truly connect with others, then her unseen playmate will disappear. Its at this moment that the film unveils the moral of the story: having imaginary friends is a normal and natural part of a childs progression to adulthood.

 Curse has two directors, Gunther Von Fritsch and Robert Wise. Wise actually took over from Fritsch when he fell behind schedule, and it turned out to be Wises first directorial effort and served as the inauguration of an impressive career, which includes highlights like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Run Silent, Run Deep, The Haunting, and The Sound of Music. Moving from horror to domestic drama, Curse succeeds thanks to its empathetic and detailed understanding of a childs imagination.

 When children are playing alone on the green,
In comes the playmate that never was seen.
When children are happy and lonely and good,
The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.
