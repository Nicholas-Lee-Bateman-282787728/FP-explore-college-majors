2998681,5,B000X73NEK,"Running from 1953 to 1964, ""Make Room for Daddy"" a/k/a ""The Danny Thomas Show,"" was one of the key situation comedies from television's golden age, chronicling the humorous experiences in the life of nightclub entertainer Danny Williams (Danny Thomas) and his family.  The show went through several distinct changes.  From 1953 to 1956, Jean Hagen played Danny's wife Margaret, and Danny's children, Rusty and Terry, were respectively portrayed by Rusty Hamer and Sherry Jackson.  Hagen left the show after the conclusion of the 1955-56 season and, for the 1956-57 season, Williams was a widower.  For the 1957-58 season, Marjorie Lord joined the cast as Williams' second wife Kathy, who brought along her daughter Linda (Angela Cartwright) into the new family.  By the beginning of the 1958-59 season (the 6th season, which this DVD set covers), Sherry Jackson's character was phased out of the principal cast and the show would continue with the regular lineup of Thomas, Lord, Hamer and Cartwright for the duration of the series.  The show was produced and frequently directed by the legendary Sheldon Leonard.

Though it's considered by many to be one of the all-time classic family TV sitcoms, ""Make Room for Daddy"" has not fared well in the digital age . . . . until now.  Previous DVD releases of the series have consisted of a handful of episodes from the Jean Hagen years that have fallen into the public domain, as well as the release of season 5 of the series in 2004 which, unfortunately, utilized edited, syndicated episodes losing 3 or more minutes per episode.  Many fans of the series criticized that release and, for a while, it looked as if there were not going to be any additional DVD releases of the series.  That situation has now been rectified, thanks to a change in the company releasing the DVDs.  The new company, S'more Entertainment, has considerable experience in bringing vintage and classic sitcoms to the market, including ""Mister Peepers,"" ""Good Morning, World"" and ""Lotsa Luck.""  For those who have been concerned about the length of the season 6 episodes, you can put your mind at ease . . . . these are the full-length episodes, including full opening and closing credits, and clocking in at just under 26 minutes per episode.  In addition to the full-length episodes, S'more has secured prints that are appreciably cleaner and sharper looking than those utilized for the season 5 release; simply put, the prints utilized for this release are as good as one might expect for a show that was broadcast 50 years ago.  The bonus features for this release are also an improvement over the season 5 set and include the following:

' Present day interviews with Marjorie Lord (Kathy Williams), Angela Cartwright (Linda Williams) and Sid Melton (Uncle Charley Halper)
' Photo Gallery (includes 43 promotional, on-set, and behind-the-scenes photos)
' Blooper Reel
' St. Jude's Hospital Promotional Film

S'more has also included brief episode synopses for the 32 episodes contained in this collection, as well as the original broadcast date, and season and series production numbers, so you can either watch the episodes in original broadcast sequence or in the order in which they were originally produced.  This type of information is rarely included on TV-on-DVD releases and is a small, but nice touch that more releasing companies ought to consider when issuing television shows on DVD.

Bottom Line:  ""Make Room for Daddy"" is a bonafide television comedy classic that has not received it's just due on DVD in the past.  This season 6 collection showcases the series in the way it was meant to be seen on DVD . . . . uncut and with the strongest visuals available for a 50 year old television show; it easily earns my full five stars.",1200960000,69,3768,4.941362916006339
2998682,5,B000X73NEK,"Questar released Season Five of this landmark series with chopped up syndicated episodes and even the syndicated opening credits.  It was awful.

My hope is that S'More is giving us the complete episodes with the original titles!

If so, my five star review will stand.

Folks, I got the set today - the review stands.  This is a terrific set.  It is more than expected and leaves a lot of other TV series collections in the dust.  At last this series, which was the bridge between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" is available as it should be seen for those who loved it then - and for those who will discover it anew.

The sad Season Five had edited syndication versions of the show with the syndication titles. This set has the original titles at the beginning of each episode and the episodes are full length.  If you were disappointed in Season Five, don't let that keep you from buying Season Six.  It's a whole new ball game.

All of the characters are here along with some stunning guest stars:  Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, William Demarest, and in a continuing arc, Miss Annette Funicello who also sings and dances.  The episodes look better than they did way back when.  The sound is as crisp and clear as the images.

The extras include interviews with Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, and Sid Melton.  They all talk candidly and with a lot of affection for the show, their work, and the star Danny Thomas.  It's great seeing Marjorie and Angela and hearing about their lives after the show.  One extra also has Marjorie (mother of actress Anne Archer) reading from her book ""A Dance and A Hug.""

There is a PSA for St. Jude Hospital that opens each DVD, and another PSA
is a short extra on one disk.  There is also a ""blooper"" reel that gives you a great backstage feel for how the show was put together.  Annette is featured in a couple of the clips, and Angela Cartwright and a hula hoop figure prominently in another.

Easy to navigate - you will enjoy all 32 episodes of ""The Danny Thomas Show"" - aka ""Make Room for Daddy.""  Danny Thomas was a unique performer who could sing, dance, do comedy, and also deliver a serious line when he wanted to.  His mannerisms - sometimes hilariously mimicked by Marjorie, Angela, and Rusty Hamer - are still funny.  The show entertains on a couple of levels:  as a sitcom and as a variety show.

As a kid I really didn't watch this show in the sixties as: my parents didn't and it seemed to be out of touch with the ""real"" world that was mine at the time. Over the years I've come to appreciate Danny Thomas with his mission for St Jude. I have since started watching the shows on ""Me TV"" and found I really liked them. Simpler time I guess.

2998702,4,B000X73NEK,"MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY/SEASON 6: This funny family series centered on the hectic career and homelife of hotheaded nightclub entertainer DANNY WILLIAMS, mixing THOMAS' well-loved storytelling routines, sentimental songs at the piano, spit-takes, and a lesson learned in every episode. Produced by SHELDON LEONARD, THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW (its alternate title) is best remembered for its later incarnation featuring MARJORIE LORD as THOMAS' glamorous (was there any other kind in pre-ROSEANNE television?) second wife, precocious ANGELA CARTWRIGHT as the cutest moppet to ever grace a sitcom, and RUSTY HAMER as his wise-cracking son. Big name show biz personalities dropped by, including BOB HOPE, LUCILLE BALL and JACK BENNY (playing The Devil himself!), while semi-regular HANS CONREID's unforgettable UNCLE TONOOSE added to the lighthearted mayhem. The program also introduced ANDY GRIFFITH's down home SHERIFF ANDY TAYLOR (who spun off into an even more popular show); suffice to say that THOMAS and LEONARD recognized talent when they saw it, folding the best of it into MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY.

RATING: FOUR NOSE JOKES",1356480000,3,1115,5.52046783625731
2998703,5,B000X73NEK,"I want to Thank Everyone for doing a review on season 6. After reading the ones of season 5, I was heartbroken as this was one of my favorite shows as a child, and I was hoping to be able to see them again. Well Thanks to You all taking the time to share Your thoughts,I was very Pleased to see season 6 was different and put my order in right then. Thank You All again. UPDATE!!!! Received Season 6 yesterday. I watched the first two discs and was very amazed at the quality of the picture and sound. Everything the other reviewers have stated about season 6 is true. It's quite possible that they have even understated the quality. If You Love old television then this is a must buy for You. You want a collection of discs that will make You laugh and tap Your foot and hear songs that will make You go back to a good time of life? Don't Miss out on this set. At the price,How can You go wrong?",1315353600,11,896,4.096590909090909
2998704,5,B000X73NEK,"I love this show. The structure of the set is great, but I wish some of the extras could have been an episode of Seasons 1-4 and an episode of Make Room For Granddaddy. As far as the show itself is concerned there is one thing I would have done differently if I made this show and that is the titles. I truly believe that the
famous guest stars names shouldn't be in the titles unless they are playing themselves, like Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, Bob Hope, ect. But those famous guest stars who play a character shouldn't be in the titles. Case in point, ""Lucille Ball upsets Williams
Household"", which is what it says on back of case, Lucille Ball didn't upset the Williams Household, Lucy Ricardo did, so the title should have been ""Lucy Ricardo Upsets Williams Household"".
The only way Lucille Ball's name would belong in the title is if Lucille Ball came to town, like Dinah Shore, Jack Benny and Bob Hope. There are other names that shouldn't have been in the titles, Tony Bennett and Tennessee Ernie. ""Lucille Ball Upsets Williams Household"", ""Take a Message"" and ""Losers Weepers"" were my favorite episode in season 6. I also don't think Sherry Jackson should have been on the cover since she was only in 1 episode. There is one more thing, In the episode ""Growing Pains"" Rusty and Linda went to their first day of school, but it was in March. When I was in school the first day of school was always the day after Labor Day which was in September. If any of you who was in school in 1959-1960 and started school in March please tell me about it.",1278288000,,1548,4.435087719298245
2998705,5,B000X73NEK,"Given the almost four year timeframe between this set and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-5/dp/B0002PUFW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 5</a>&nbsp;set, there was much concern whether ""Make Room For Daddy"" would even see a Season 6 release. Questar (the studio behind the previous set) caught a lot of heat from consumers over the syndicated episodes used for the Season 5 set. Enter S'more Entertainment who apparently listened to buyers by releasing Make Room For Daddy - Season 6 with complete, uncut episodes plus great extras. Unlike Questar with the Season 5 box set, S'more requested the original broadcast masters (not the syndicated versions) so all the original openings and closings of each episode are included. They also cleaned up the audio, interviewed Marjorie Lord (Kathy Williams), Sid Melton (Charlie Halper) and Angela Cartwright (Linda Williams) and even found a 10 minute outtake/blooper reel for the set. With a smaller box size than the previous set, the discs are housed in slimcases which not only give brief episode synopses and original airdates but also the episode number for the season followed by the episode number for the series. Overall, S'more Entertainment went above and beyond with this release.

I was surprised at how well this show is written, and quite frankly, I had forgotten how talented Danny Thomas was, and how funny Rusty Hamer was as his son. ""Make Room For Daddy"" is much smarter than most of the family sitcoms from that era.  If there was a national station truly committed to ""preserving our television heritage"" and ""Make Room for Daddy"" were included in its lineup,  I think it would find a whole new generation of fans, however since that is unlikely to happen, we need more complete seasons of ""Make Room for Daddy"".",1215216000,,605,4.635514018691588

Wow! I've only watched the first disc so far but I'm hooked! Anyone who assumes that 50's comedies are going to be dull and twee should open their minds because much of the humour in this show (and others of the era) is reflected in the likes of The Simpsons, Seinfeld etc. A special mention must go to Angela Cartwright, a little girl who's comic timing makes her look like a real pro. Her performance here is incredible.

As a kid I really didn't watch this show in the sixties as: my parents didn't and it seemed to be out of touch with the ""real"" world that was mine at the time. Over the years I've come to appreciate Danny Thomas with his mission for St Jude. I have since started watching the shows on ""Me TV"" and found I really liked them. Simpler time I guess. Anyhow, in the 50s, with a different wife. Watching Thomas get his acting ""teeth"". Very good!!",1415059200,,545,4.055555555555555

3233199,4,B000X73NEK,"MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY/SEASON 6: This funny family series centered on the hectic career and homelife of hotheaded nightclub entertainer DANNY WILLIAMS, mixing THOMAS' well-loved storytelling routines, sentimental songs at the piano, spit-takes, and a lesson learned in every episode. Produced by SHELDON LEONARD, THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW (its alternate title) is best remembered for its later incarnation featuring MARJORIE LORD as THOMAS' glamorous (was there any other kind in pre-ROSEANNE television?) second wife, precocious ANGELA CARTWRIGHT as the cutest moppet to ever grace a sitcom, and RUSTY HAMER as his wise-cracking son. Big name show biz personalities dropped by, including BOB HOPE, LUCILLE BALL and JACK BENNY (playing The Devil himself!), while semi-regular HANS CONREID's unforgettable UNCLE TONOOSE added to the lighthearted mayhem. The program also introduced ANDY GRIFFITH's down home SHERIFF ANDY TAYLOR (who spun off into an even more popular show); suffice to say that THOMAS and LEONARD recognized talent when they saw it, folding the best of it into MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY.

RATING: FOUR NOSE JOKES",1356480000,3,1115,5.52046783625731
3233200,5,B000X73NEK,"I want to Thank Everyone for doing a review on season 6. After reading the ones of season 5, I was heartbroken as this was one of my favorite shows as a child, and I was hoping to be able to see them again. Well Thanks to You all taking the time to share Your thoughts,I was very Pleased to see season 6 was different and put my order in right then. Thank You All again. UPDATE!!!! Received Season 6 yesterday. I watched the first two discs and was very amazed at the quality of the picture and sound. Everything the other reviewers have stated about season 6 is true. It's quite possible that they have even understated the quality. If You Love old television then this is a must buy for You. You want a collection of discs that will make You laugh and tap Your foot and hear songs that will make You go back to a good time of life? Don't Miss out on this set. At the price,How can You go wrong?",1315353600,11,896,4.096590909090909
3233201,5,B000X73NEK,"I love this show. The structure of the set is great, but I wish some of the extras could have been an episode of Seasons 1-4 and an episode of Make Room For Granddaddy. As far as the show itself is concerned there is one thing I would have done differently if I made this show and that is the titles. I truly believe that the
famous guest stars names shouldn't be in the titles unless they are playing themselves, like Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, Bob Hope, ect. But those famous guest stars who play a character shouldn't be in the titles. Case in point, ""Lucille Ball upsets Williams
Household"", which is what it says on back of case, Lucille Ball didn't upset the Williams Household, Lucy Ricardo did, so the title should have been ""Lucy Ricardo Upsets Williams Household"".
The only way Lucille Ball's name would belong in the title is if Lucille Ball came to town, like Dinah Shore, Jack Benny and Bob Hope. There are other names that shouldn't have been in the titles, Tony Bennett and Tennessee Ernie. ""Lucille Ball Upsets Williams Household"", ""Take a Message"" and ""Losers Weepers"" were my favorite episode in season 6. I also don't think Sherry Jackson should have been on the cover since she was only in 1 episode. There is one more thing, In the episode ""Growing Pains"" Rusty and Linda went to their first day of school, but it was in March. When I was in school the first day of school was always the day after Labor Day which was in September. If any of you who was in school in 1959-1960 and started school in March please tell me about it.",1278288000,,1548,4.435087719298245
3233202,5,B000X73NEK,"Given the almost four year timeframe between this set and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-5/dp/B0002PUFW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 5</a>&nbsp;set, there was much concern whether ""Make Room For Daddy"" would even see a Season 6 release. Questar (the studio behind the previous set) caught a lot of heat from consumers over the syndicated episodes used for the Season 5 set. Enter S'more Entertainment who apparently listened to buyers by releasing Make Room For Daddy - Season 6 with complete, uncut episodes plus great extras. Unlike Questar with the Season 5 box set, S'more requested the original broadcast masters (not the syndicated versions) so all the original openings and closings of each episode are included. They also cleaned up the audio, interviewed Marjorie Lord (Kathy Williams), Sid Melton (Charlie Halper) and Angela Cartwright (Linda Williams) and even found a 10 minute outtake/blooper reel for the set. With a smaller box size than the previous set, the discs are housed in slimcases which not only give brief episode synopses and original airdates but also the episode number for the season followed by the episode number for the series. Overall, S'more Entertainment went above and beyond with this release. Fans who've been longing to own a quality Make Room For Daddy season set on DVD are sure to be pleased by all the work put into this set.",1263340800,17,1429,5.5

I now have season five and six of the Make Room for Daddy series and would enjoy having all of the series.
I can remember watching some of them when they first aired on TV.
If there are other fans of Danny, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, or Rusty Hammer, please contact [...] and show them your interest and perhaps these other series will be produced.",1218499200,,459,4.287356321839081
3233208,5,B000X73NEK,"This spring I purchased ""Make Room for Daddy--the Sixth Season"".  I was surprised at how well this show is written, and quite frankly, I had forgotten how talented Danny Thomas was, and how funny Rusty Hamer was as his son. ""Make Room For Daddy"" is much smarter than most of the family sitcoms from that era.  If there was a national station truly committed to ""preserving our television heritage"" and ""Make Room for Daddy"" were included in its lineup,  I think it would find a whole new generation of fans, however since that is unlikely to happen, we need more complete seasons of ""Make Room for Daddy"".",1215216000,,605,4.635514018691588
3233209,5,B000X73NEK,"Being from England I'd never heard of this show before, and I don't think it's ever been shown on British TV, so I bought the set purely based on the reviews here and a little internet research. Wow! I've only watched the first disc so far but I'm hooked! Anyone who assumes that 50's comedies are going to be dull and twee should open their minds because much of the humour in this show (and others of the era) is reflected in the likes of The Simpsons, Seinfeld etc. A special mention must go to Angela Cartwright, a little girl who's comic timing makes her look like a real pro. Her performance here is incredible.
This is fast becoming one of my favourite comedies and I'd urge anyone looking for a classic to check this out. 5 stars and more...",1208563200,,749,4.357142857142857
3233210,3,B000X73NEK,"Great work bringing this season to DVD, but this is the season that poses a question I have been wondering ever since I was a kid watching this series. Why was Sherry Jackson removed from the series, later to be replaced by a lookalike actor (Penney Parker)?????She appears in three episodes then is just ""gone"", in the 1959-60 she returns as having come back from college and having graduated (what a short course!!)I read somewhere at one time that Jackson who had played his daughter since the series began, had become intimidated by Thomas as she matured and grew into a young woman and asked to leave.

There are wonderful performances by people like Tennessee Ernie Ford, Tony Bennett (who's career was only just beginning), Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz to name a few. I am not disappointed at all. I just wish someone would release the whole series to DVD. A great show for its time. The humour still holds up well to this day 60 years on.
