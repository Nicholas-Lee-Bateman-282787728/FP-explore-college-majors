3101227,5,B0012ZZ5VQ,7-30-15. Fabulous presentation from Steve Saint about his life up to the time of the video. I highly recommend this video and have shared with others.  I had the pleasure of briefly meeting Steve shortly after he made this video and prior to his accident. His dad and Steve have been an inspiration to my life and I deeply appreciate his faithful witness to the miraculous events that have punctuated his life.,1438214400,,410,4.694444444444445

8248674,5,B0012ZZ5VQ,"Wonderful  to  hear  first  hand  how  Steve  and  his  family  returned  to  help  the  Indians  who  killed Steve's  dad.
They  became  fast  friends  with  his  children  calling  ""grandfather""  to  the  one  who  slayed  him  years  ago.
Steve's  aunt,  Rachel,  translated  the  Bible  for  them.  They  have  been  converted  and become  followers  of  God.",1522540800,,363,4.962264150943396

8248683,5,B0012ZZ5VQ,"Very encouraging video. Highly recommend. Our book club just read ""Through Gates of Splendor"" and part of me wondered, was it worth it that these five men lost their lives in Ecuador at such young ages. This more than answers that question and tells more of the rest of the story. It also has  a relevant message for today - ""Let Him write His story with your life.""",1442188800,,366,4.382352941176471
