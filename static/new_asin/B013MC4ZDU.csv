This is a way to experience that place without having to go there, plus Im getting my daily cardiovascular fitness routine.  I find that the camera work is realistic- its not so smooth that it seems dreamlike or unreal.  It actually moves up and down a little much at the same pace as my walking but its not at all distracting, I think it adds to the realism.  My husband ended up liking the Joshua Tree part better actually and we both found the Columbia gold-mining town to be quaint and historic.  Best of all, this is good, clean fun!  Even my grand kids like pretending they're walking alongside of us while watching this video.",1439078400,,737,4.382352941176471
