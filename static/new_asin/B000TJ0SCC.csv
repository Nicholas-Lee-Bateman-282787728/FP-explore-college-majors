I haven't viewed all of the discs, but it is an interesting intro to these operas.",1496707200,,154,4.535714285714286
8209714,4,B000TJ0SCC,I am learning about operas and this is told very clearly.,1491523200,,57,4.2727272727272725
8209715,4,B000TJ0SCC,"These date from 1989 but they represent a fine way to introduce listeners to the ten operas because the story line and the highlights are presented for each in a reasonable listening time. Of course, Charlton Heston is a very good narrator.",1485993600,,240,4.738095238095238
8209716,5,B000TJ0SCC,"I purchased this initially to use in a general music class, when covering information about composers, many of whom considered it the pinnacle of their success to write a well received opera by the public.  While it served its purpose there, it also has strong uses for sharing these same stories with voice students who may consider entering the realm of opera.

On the back of the DVD case, it explains that ""Opera Stories provides a perfect introduction to the drama, characters and spectacle of the opera.  Each of its ten programs tells the story of a single opera, bringing the story and emotion of the plot vividly to life.  Charlton Heston narrates each program from, as nearly as possible, the original location stipulated by the composer:  the story of La Bohme is told from the sidewalk cafs of Paris where Mimi and Rodolfo fall in love, Aida from the majestic pyramids of Egypt, Tosca from the battlements of the Castel Saint' Angelo in Rome where Tosca takers her own life.  The stories are illustrated by extensive performance extracts take from NVC Arts' unique library of full length recordings.

As for those performance extracts five come from the Royal Opera Productions of:
LA BOHME with Ileana Cotrubas and Neil Shicoff from Paris, France;
MANON LESCAUT with Plcido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa from Chteau Mauviers, France;
ANDREA CHNIER with Plcido Domingo and Anna Tomowa-Sintow from Paris, France;
FALSTAFF with Ranato Bruson, Barbara Hendricks and Katia Ricciarelli from Windsor, England; and
DIE FLEDERMAUS from Vienna, Austria with Kiri Te Kanawa and Hermann Prey.
I have the full length Fledermaus with Dame Te Kanawa.  It is delightful in the way it bounces around in several languages, including English, and Prince Orlofsky's special party guests.  Plcido Domingo conducts this gem.

The other 5 operas used come from Arena di Verona productions of:
IL TROVATORE set in Aragon, Spain with Rosalind Plowright, Franco Bonisolli, and Giorgio Zancanaro;
TOSCA from Rome, Italy with Eva Marton, Ingvar Wixell and Giacomo Aragall;
AIDA set in Luxor, Egypt with Maria Chiara, Fiorenza Cossotto and Nicola Martinucci.
OTELLO from Marakesh, Morocco with Kirit Te Kanawa, Vladimir Atlantov and Piero Cappucilli, and finishing off with:
ERNANI in the La Scala, Milan production narrated from Aragon, Spain starring Plcido Domingo, Mirella Freni, Renato Bruson and Nicolai Ghiarov.

There is simply not another compilation of Operas that delves into the locations and stories as this volume does.  Of course, it does not give a complete performances of each opera, but the portions included highlight the drama and emotion of each composition, while Heston's presence as the guide to locations chosen by the composers is something not to be found unless you are willing to tour each location personally, and steep yourself in each composers creative choices.",1365379200,13,2876,5.174568965517241
