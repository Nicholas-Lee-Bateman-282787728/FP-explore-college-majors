3515370,3,B001CP1UMO,This story left an awful lot out concerning Anita Hill before the hearing.,1456704000,,74,4.769230769230769
3515371,3,B001CP1UMO,"Interesting, but basically just a replay of the testimonies with a commentary.  Most of this could be seen on C-SPAN as well.",1456617600,,125,4.681818181818182
3515372,5,B001CP1UMO,"Excellent!  A must see as to how women where treated then and unfortunately, are still disrespected by many in the workplace today.  This event exposed ""sexual harassment"" which was constant in the workplace for years before Anita Hill testified.  I am grateful she did because I could relate to her considering I too was sexually harassed for years.  It is telling how Anita Hill became the villain and Thomas became the victim with an all white male committee.  Senator Kennedy certainly stepped up supporting Anita Hill's testimony while other Senators were on the fence or made her the issue rather than Thomas.  No doubt she was poorly treated by the GOP.  As Kennedy said, ""Shame"" on the GOP committee members for their character assassination of Anita Hill. The she said - he said opened up Pandora's box to create change for women in the workplace - historical.  Thank you Anita Hill for your honesty, courage and dignity.  I believed her then and to this day I believe Anita Hill.",1442534400,2,989,4.804733727810651
3515373,5,B001CP1UMO,"Excellent documentary. I remember being glued to the TV during the entire hearings in 1991 and coming away totally disgusted with the Republicans. I was also ashamed that the Democrats, except for Teddy Kennedy, came off so wishy-washy. But this reflects the sexual attitudes and the politics of the time. According to narrator Gloria Steinem, these hearings were a landmark in US feminist history because they brought sexual harassment to the fore as a major issue. Many women decided to run for the Senate, some against particularly obnoxious committee members. But I'm somewhat skeptical that Anita Hill would be more fairly treated by today's sorry-ass GOP. The good news, I think, is the likelihood that the GOP hot-air bubble may be in the process of bursting.",1437523200,,766,5.087301587301587
3515374,5,B001CP1UMO,"This case was huge. Anita Hill had courage rarely found in anyone these days.  The courage to stand up in spite of a process that doesn't support, value or believe you.  When watching this I watched Anita's face to see indications of deception, there were none.  I believe Anita Hill and I believe that Thomas not watching her testimony was a deliberate legal strategy to avoid specific questions about her testimony. The character witnesses for judge Thomas were Hispanic or Black and and gave vague characterizations about their boss.  The witnesses for Anita told of specific dates on which Anita had told them of the harassment, all long before the confirmation hearings.  Senator Specter's behavior was appalling. He would ask convoluted questions in an attempt to get a contradictory answer. Thomas' own inclusion of the black male sexual stereotype, probably did more to indict him than anything else, and it was absolutely ridiculous, the panel was obviously uncomfortable.  Senator Kennedy was one of the few voices willing to stand up for what was obviously the truth.  She passed a polygraph, and had absolutely nothing to gain by making the allegations known.  I'm glad we have come so much farther in this country.  Hats off to Anita Hill, she's a real American shero.",1415923200,12,1281,5.004716981132075
3515375,5,B001CP1UMO,This was an excellent view of what happen during this trial compared to what the media has shown as to what happened. This shows how those in power will always win when it comes to prosecute someone that has done wrong.,1408320000,4,219,4.365853658536586

3515377,5,B001CP1UMO,"We should all be required to go back and watch this. Anita Hill was poised, truthful and brave. The hearings and her testimony brought sexual harassment into the public arena and made it a legitimate issue. It's heartening to see so many more workplace policies and trainings in place today because of it.",1396396800,10,305,4.773584905660377

Shows the kind of corruption that goes on in our government today.",1466380800,,78,4.642857142857143

8288517,5,B001CP1UMO,"This film is disturbing because it shows viewers one of the worst parts of government officials. Everyone in government is shown in a bad light, including Joe Biden, then a senator in charge of the judiciary committee, Senator Kennedy who waited until the end of the hearing to make a statement, and it was brief, all the senators on the committee, and President Bush and his advisors. All were interested in politics, in saving their seats. Testimony that would have supported Anita Hill is withheld. As a result, according to the film, one member of the Supreme Court is not qualified to serve, morally and intellectually. It is no surprise that he keeps silent. He won his seat after many shenanigans by two votes.

The film clearly favors Anita Hill. Clarence Thomas seems like a bub. A professor says he has students who are smarter and better qualified to be on the Supreme Court than Thomas. He seems guilty. He presents no evidence to show he is innocent other to say this is a typical hanging of a black man.",1463443200,2,1017,4.65
