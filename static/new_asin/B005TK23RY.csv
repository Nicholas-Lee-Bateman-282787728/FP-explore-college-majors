8486314,5,B005TK23RY,"I really enjoyed watching Saban take over the role of Head Coach, and turning the Tide at Alabama. The other side of this package includes five of the defining moments at Alabama... Like The Takeaway, where an underdog Bama takes on an unbeatable Miami (according to all the press)and wins the National Championship... with all the interviews with coaches and players, its something every Bama fan will enjoy.
