7994425,1,B00009YXK6,"I really like AG, but this is the worst DVD I got... bad sound, bad images (not the best AG performance)",1267747200,,104,4.0
7994426,2,B00009YXK6,"First: Alejandra is the best female voice to sing rock.
Second :The director of this dvd was the wrong person to make it.( I don't know who is and I don't wanna Know)
I agree with the song selction,23 songs, all her hits.
  This dvd doesn't have quality, the sound is bad,the dolby mode is just the music and Alejandra's voice and sound very dull and plain. Besides, the 5.1 digital dolby, is the public singing and you can barely listen the band. This was a very bad sound mix.( I have home theater system )
  The visual part,It is totally dark and this bring a horrible image in the tv.the stage is empty,just the band filling the huuuuuge stage of the Auditoruio Nacional in Mexico city. And, I don't want to say this, but Alejandra looks fat and nothing femenine.
  But, it has some good sides,""Labios de fuego"" with a good concept in the stage and the silver angel,when Alejadra is singing""Angels Caidos"".
  Alejandra how you dared to do this DVD.you deserve something better than this.
  I was expecting to see something similar like the concert that was broadcasted in 1990( live in tepoztlan) by Televisa, so far, the best concert in tv of Alejandra.",1151280000,,1158,4.577669902912621
7994427,5,B00009YXK6,I love the DVD and love the way Alejandra sings the ballads.  She's soooo good and sensual. It's one of my favorite DVD concerts besides Luis Miguel.  I am now a true fan of hers...,1109462400,,181,4.142857142857143
7994428,4,B00009YXK6,"I watched the show on TV and the crowd was really excited, as usual during Guzman's concerts. But I think the man who took care of the audio did a poor job. It feels as if the people there were not thrilled during the show, but they were. I know so because a friend of mine went to the show and also because I watched it on TV (everybody sings ""Hacer el amor con otro"" along with Ale and it is a very nice moment).

I think Ale is a professional and certainly knows how to entertain an audience. I also enjoyed the muscial arrangements shje did to several songs (""Enemigos"", ""De verdad"", ""Eternamente bella"", ""Guera"", ""Loca"" etc sound different than their original versions). My favourite one is definetely ""Cuidado con el corazn"". She did a nice show and I definetely recommend this DVD to rock'n'roll fans and of course, Ale's fans.",1104105600,,834,4.4868421052631575
7994429,2,B00009YXK6,"This DVD did not deserve to be on the market for sale.  The quality of the sounds, and camera are veryyyyyyyyy poor.  After all the years of career from La Guzman this is not a really good move from her.  The fans deserve something better with high quality.  Anyway I recommemd her La Guzman album from Cancum Live 1996 or 1997, which is a great concert.",1091750400,4,354,4.318181818181818
7994430,3,B00009YXK6,"I like very much Alejandra's music and I was more than excited when I knew that she was releasing a live DVD. But when I saw the DVD I was disappointed because it wasn't very good.
First of all. The stage was very big and looked like empty, the sound quality wasn't good, the camera direction it's poor, the crowd wasn't very excited and finally Alejandra's performance wasn't her best.
With the special features you can find a short interview with Alejandra, the two videos of her song ""Diablo"" and the video of her smash hit ""De verdad"" plus behind the scenes and rehearsals before the show.
The sound can be in Dolby Stereo or 5.1 Digital Dolby (what I meant before about the sound was that it wasn't good during the show).
On the other hand I can say that the song selection is very good, you can find almost all the songs of her 2001 Grammy award winning album ""Soy"" and her other hits such as ""Eternamente bella"", ""Reina de corazones"", ""Toda la mitad"", ""Mala hierba"", ""Angeles caidos"", ""Mirala, miralo"" and ""Cuidado con el corazon"".",1087430400,3,1038,4.55614973262032
