8047839,4,B0007KX8EI,"Both of these episodes from the 1967-68 of Irwin Allen's ""space opera,"" though not of the caliber of ""Star Trek,"" stand out for different reasons.

""The Space Primevals"" was the last time that the show took advantage of the Fox back lot for some impressive outdoor shots of ""the Chariot"" as it is trapped at the base of a volcano.  The episode also gives the oft-feuding ""Don"" (Mark Goddard) and ""Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) an unexpected time to bond as they contemplate what appears to be their death.

""The Space Destructors"" allowed star Guy Williams an opportunity to return to his ""Zorro"" roots as he has to do battle with several dozen androids of Dr. Smith.  The android-making machine sequence is well-done, as are the many masks used of Harris in the battle shots.  The most impressive of the masks is the one worn by Billy Mumy (""Will"") as he is turned into one of the Smith look-alikes.

Use of John Williams's first year musical cues permeates both episodes and the music is a welcome addition to the ""out-of-this-world"" stories.",1108512000,,1042,4.761111111111111
