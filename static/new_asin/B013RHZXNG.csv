7370602,5,B013RHZXNG,Incredible performance from the songs to the theatrics this band never disappoints. The amount of fire used by the band is insane but oh so amazing.,1496016000,,148,4.730769230769231

7370604,5,B013RHZXNG,"I wish I could've seen them live that day at Madison Square Garden, but this is the best I'll get. The documentary was awesome to watch because you get to learn more about Rammstein, but also the concert as well was just phenomenal to see!!!",1489190400,,241,4.377777777777778

7370608,5,B013RHZXNG,"I flew from Los Angeles to see this show at Madison Square Garden, New York with my daughter for her 16th birthday.  It had been 10 years since they last played in the United States and it was astounding both musically and visually.  The live concert DVD took me back to that cold winter night and reminded me that I had seen one of the greatest rock spectacles of all-time.  I have seen 100's of shows since going to my first concert in 1975, and this was a night of nights.  This DVD is a must for Rammstein fans and should be viewed by anybody under 25 who thinks they have seen a great rock and roll show.",1483401600,5,609,4.135593220338983
7370609,3,B013RHZXNG,"It was a good show, and I saw them in Tacoma in 2011, but this is mostly Canadian. I mean, 90% Canadian. It was actually kinda upsetting.",1481673600,,137,4.111111111111111

7370613,5,B013RHZXNG,"I don't care where the concert took place and that seemed to be a complaint among some buyers.
I wish they included ""Los"" in the set list. That has to be one of my favorites. I doubt if I get to see them live,but I do have this dvd to watch many times. The picture and sound for the blu ray are what you should expect .Do not watch unless you have a nice surround with a good sub...just wouldn't do it justice and 60"" (or larger)tv.",1480032000,3,432,3.9770114942528734
7370614,5,B013RHZXNG,They put on one hell of a stage show!!  And they rock!,1479081600,,54,3.5
7370615,5,B013RHZXNG,Good quality concert video,1479081600,,26,5.75
7370616,4,B013RHZXNG,"I'll agree with some other reviews that the editing is weird, but that's not a deal-breaker. I only found it mildly distracting. Other than that, everything that is here is amazing. The show is great with great sound quality, the documentary is amazing.

What holds this back is what is not there. One thing to keep in mind it that this concert was just after the album Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da came out, so the setlist is heavy with songs from that album. Six of them to be exact. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because that's an awesome album, and the songs are great live, but it does mean some of the classics get left off. The show doesn't include Mein Teil, Reise, Reise, Ohne Dich, Mutter, Mein Herz Brennt, or, oddly enough, Amerika. Everything that's there is amazing, and they can't do every song, but if you were expecting a greatest hits setlist, this is not it.

I'm also slightly disappointed that there has not been a album of this show released yet. I would really like a way to listen to this amazing performance without having to fire up a Blu-ray player.

All of that said, this is by far worth the money. It's an amazing performance by a truly amazing band. Just be aware what you are getting.",1478649600,,1215,4.439461883408072

7370618,5,B013RHZXNG,good documentary with concert,1477872000,,29,6.5
7370619,5,B013RHZXNG,"This is the most amazing live performance you will ever see.  All other concerts will seem tame once you view this show.  And hyperbole aside, this Blu-ray really feels like the next best thing to actually being there in Madison Square Garden.  Seriously, no other concert in my Blu-ray/DVD collection even comes close to drawing me into the performance like this one does.  While Rammstein was awesome on stage, with all members performing at 100%, I wish to address the heroes behind the scene who made this Blu-ray amazing.  Number one on the list are the mega-talented audio engineers.  The recording and final mix are fantastic.  These guys should be contracted by every other band on Earth who wish to release a concert video.  The concert photography is exactly that, concert photography.  Most concert videos feature the same boring shot structure; wide shot of stage, static close-ups and a dolly that can follow the band members as they move around.  This show was shot with a ton of cameras all around the arena; cameras on the ground both facing the stage and the audience, mobile cameras on the stage, cameras on dollies and on three separate cranes.  The result is dynamic and complex shot structure.  Finally, the editing is subtle when it needs to be and bonkers the rest of the time.  I found my adrenal glads kicking in several times during this show.  If you love watching live music buy this Blu-ray right now.  If you don't gravitate toward concert videos but wish to witness a spectacle, buy this Blu-ray right now.",1477872000,3,1537,4.7908745247148286
7370620,5,B013RHZXNG,I don't know what other people were thinking about this but to me this is by far the greatest concert on DVD that I think I've ever seen I don't understand where they think it was video like MTV format it was totally awesome I would highly  recommend this DVD to any ram stein fan in the world the best,1476489600,,302,4.033333333333333

Must have for Rammstein fans.",1471824000,,348,4.915254237288136
7370628,5,B013RHZXNG,"Incredible video and audio quality. I had just seen them in Chicago, and this video does it so much justice.  Crowd shots are incredible as well.  Stage show is captured with close ups that make it feel so real.  Documentary is really good as well - from pre Ramstein to the NY show. The members are really serious, and even a bit humble, which surprised me a bit.  Highly recommended.  Audio and video quality alone are fantastic.",1471737600,,431,4.545454545454546

7370642,5,B013RHZXNG,"Having personally been at this concert, the Blu-ray does it justice. Great quality. This is probably the reason why people aren't going to shows as often. The sound is tremendous. My television can not handle it. I have to invest in a sound bar or surround sound system.",1462406400,,270,4.645833333333333

7370644,4,B013RHZXNG,"Not sure how to review this as everyone who knows the band knows the shows w/ massive pyrotechnics w/ heavy, catchy riffs, or someone who just randomly came across this DVD. If you're the former, the show is as FANTASTIC  as always and it was even more epic since this is the first US tour in freaking forever. So why not 5 stars? Two reasons, the annoying editing that annoyingly took away great shots of the pyrotechnics like in ""Ich Tu Dir Weh"", and secondly, that annoying, half ugly, chubby, emo girl w/ ugly big, blue headphones that keeps getting in shots for some reason, I don't know, it's the cameraman has a fetish for ugly, emo girls, and why do you need headphones when you're going to a concert, music on the way? C'mon now, nobody that's on their first concert rodeo does this.

For the former people in the first sentence, check out their live vids, love 'em? DVD is a must buy, there's new pyrotechnics and songs from ""Live Aus Nimes"". Rammstein is a German industrial, metal band w/ huge heavy hooks, great vocals, interesting lyrics, w/ an overall great show and songs. How can a band write such heavy songs yet make such great, emotional slower songs?",1462147200,,1171,4.545023696682464

7370652,5,B013RHZXNG,"In my teens, Rammstein was a band that I fell in love with.  Almost 2 decades later they still carry that energy that pulled me into their grips.  Their music is powerful, and their stage show is truly something to behold.  This blu-ray gives the band justice in terms of showing what they do best.

7370665,3,B013RHZXNG,Rammstein is awesome.  This disc sounds amazing.  The problem is the directing and editing of the DVD.  IT IS ALMOST COMICAL HOW FAST THE CUTS ARE.  IT IS LITERALLY A SERIES OF 1 SECOND CLIPS BEFORE CUTTING TO ANOTHER 1 SECOND CLIP AD INFINIUM.  Gives me a headache.  A concert experience is not like that.  Can we just watch the show from a static perspective for longer than 1 second please???,1455321600,23,395,4.47887323943662

7370674,4,B013RHZXNG,"Hey, it's Rammstein, got to be a 5-star, right?  As a few other reviews note, this looks like a music video.  And that is fine for a 3 minute music video.  But to watch an entire concert like this is frustrating and I was disappointed.  What do I mean? Each view is literally less than a second, meaning, you see one camera shot for a millisecond then another shot for a millisecond.  Its all chopped up.  So you see the drums for a brief flash, then cut to Till for a millisecond, then back to Richard, then to  Its more chopped up than this review.  I watched it.  I don't regret purchasing it.  But there are better bootleg videos done by fans on YouTube.  I want to see a concert from the view of someone actually at the show.  Not from 187 cameras.  Yes, the different angles and views are great.  But let me see them for more than a second.  And almost the entire video is this way.  A few of the fire effects are shown a bit longer.  But not much longer.  If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it but know what you are getting.  I still prefer how Live Aus Berlin and Volkerball were shot.  My 2 cents.",1454025600,20,1105,4.098591549295775

7370679,5,B013RHZXNG,"This concert was for the headbangers and thrashers. No doubt that is who the setlist is for as some of their other songs that I really like are not on here, a few on Sensucht, a few on Reise Reise a couple on Mutter etc. Anyway still a good show. Geez Christoph Schneider does get after the drums big time but they all played great and to the point no mistakes..........industrial German machine.

Till is really quite the voice and showman....man the chicks in this crowd young and old I know would drop their pants for this guy if he walked into the same room with them. They worshipped him and you could see it when the cameras came around.

Then there is the bonus material and I really enjoyed listening to these guys (subtitles) and their voices all sounded very similar including Till but thats their accents as well. Really good interesting I would recommend to anyone I am sure you will find something here that holds your attention, probably a lot more.",1453593600,,963,4.528735632183908

Boy am I glad I did.  This show was AMAZING!  Great music, great stage show, great picture and sound quality, everything you could ask.  If you're already a Rammstein fan this concert will make you an even bigger one.  Even if you're not a big Rammstein fan this show will make you a convert.  Since watching this disc I bought the Made in Germany best of CD's and a couple others.  If Rammstein tours the U.S. again I'll be sure to go to a show.

7370691,5,B013RHZXNG,Several years ago I just happened to see a Rammstein video on YouTube and was hooked. I started buying their albums and trying to find all of their videos. I don't understand the German language but it's music and you don't have to understand any language if the music is good. These guys are not only a great band they are also very entertaining and the videos are good. If you haven't seen them in concert then check out the videos from their concerts.

I never heard the band before and bought this on the strength of a single video I saw on Rammstein's Official Channel on YouTube.  This is right up there with other iconic music videos I own such as Monterrey Pop, Woodstock, Simon and Garfunkel's Concert In Central Park and Stop Making Sense.  OK, you can tell from that list that I'm a senior citizen, yes I'm old but I now have a Rammstein channel Pandora.  Buy this you kids, and get off my lawn!",1447977600,6,616,4.710280373831775

7370733,4,B013RHZXNG,"I'd love to give this 5*'s but here's why I didn't:

Re: Concert Bluray:
The stylized editing of the concert makes it look like a music video. Editing was tight, and I was certainly glad they included some behind-the-scenes footage, but because of the post-effects look, overdriven colors, etc it felt less like a concert performance and more like a music video. The sound mix is incredible, and you will blow your windows out with the right 5.1/7.1 setup.

Re: Rammstein Documentary:
THIS is what really shines. A solid two hours of ancient footage of band members in their first performances in separate bands back in East Germany, compelling story, heaps of anecdotes and behind the scenes footage.
Montreal / MSG Concert footage used in this documentary has a much cleaner look that I would have preferred for the Concert Bluray.
Loads of artist/creative cameos sharing opinions and anecdotes on Rammstein.
Fully customizable audio and subtitles, languages at least English and German. I, for one, was happy I could listen to it in original sound while my wife could read along in English.
 This disc would be worth it even if sold alone.",1445126400,7,1142,4.9067357512953365

7370736,5,B013RHZXNG,"You must own this if you are an American Rammstein fan. Not only is the live concert mind blowing, but the audio and video quality is top-notch. The documentary is very very good too. It really puts into perspective just how crazy it was for a German industrial metal band to break into the US market despite not singing in English. Great interviews and never-before-seen footage. The making of Liebe ist fr alle da is decent but there is some overlap with the documentary. You will not be disappointed however with the overall product.",1444694400,,536,4.712765957446808

Bands such as Aerosmith and Anthrax are interviewed and yeah they wish they had the talent and showmanship of Rammstein.  My only complaint is how those 2 bands didn't have a notepad and pen so they could take notes from Rammstein on how to make better albums, singles and live shows.",1444262400,,362,4.46969696969697

7370744,5,B013RHZXNG,"One of the best performance DVDs I've seen in a long time. The audio and visuals are amazing. I would totally recommend for any music fans even if you're not into Rammstein, this is totally worth the purchase.",1444003200,,209,4.526315789473684
7370745,5,B013RHZXNG,"So many of us became fans of this band because  of their incredible concerts and massive stage production.  The MSG concert DVD is a video concert that is as good as it gets. The sound is incredible (I don't see how you can do any better for concert sound), many cameras, great set list executed with the professional tightness we expect from these concert masters. If you are a fan, you probably have this already; it is a must have.  If you are not yet a fan, I can tell you I found this band years ago hunting on Amazon for great concert DVD's. Its not long before you hear the name Rammstein in connection with great concerts.  If you are a fan of superb massive over the top rock stage shows, you won't go wrong with this DVD.  Give it a try.",1443830400,4,747,4.195804195804196
7370746,5,B013RHZXNG,"This is now my favorite Blu-ray!!! I may be a bit biased though. I first saw R+ in 1998 in Seattle, after that show I purchased my first concert DVD, Live Aus Berlin. I had it sitting in my collection and tried to get my wife to watch it, she wouldn't. Then while I was away for a weekend she happened to watch it TWICE in one night! She was not a fan until then. So for the next few years (Approx. 10) when we'd talk about concerts we'd been to, I would hold the fact that I had seen R+ live, and she hadn't. Well that all changed with the LIFAD tour as R+ once again came around on May 14, 2012 to Tacoma. We bought tickets as soon as they were on sale. We left the concert euphoric. I kept hoping for a decent concert DVD to come out. Vlkerball and Live Aus Berlin were good in their own respects, but I felt the sound wasn't what it could be and the images not as sharp as they could be. After once again being treated for a third show, again in Tacoma May 15, 2013, I could only hope for a great DVD of a Rammstein concert. Well here we are in 2015, and now we have the definitive concert BLU-RAY! The sound is off the charts, and the images are crisp (especially when it comes to the sparks)! Till's vocals are all there, the guitars are more 'crunchy' than a studio album, and the stage antics are a sight! This perfectly captures what it is like to experience R+ in the flesh, save for two things, the heat, and the sweat.

Even if you are not a fan of R+ I cannot recommend this purchase enough, at least find someone who has it to see for yourself! I have been to plenty of concerts in my life and none of them top R+. If you are a fan of music and performance....watch this NOW! Do not get hung up on ""Oh it's in German, what's the point?"" If you do you are selling yourself, and this band, considerably short, music and performance don't always have to be understood to get a feeling across.",1443744000,34,1903,4.0611702127659575
7370747,5,B013RHZXNG,"I've been a fan of Rammstein since 1998, and obsessed with their music. So, to see the history of their beginning and how they became what they are was a huge treat.

7370750,5,B013RHZXNG,"I`m not sure how much was actually shot at the MSG in NY City, but it`s a good show. A lot of it seems to be from the show I attended in Montreal on December 9, 2010 (""Scurit"" written on Bell Centre security people, Rammstein-Quebec flag, and can NY City people sign that well in French during Frhling in Paris?. etc). That being said, some footage from Engel is not from Montreal as they had some technical difficulties with the right-hand-side wing on Till in the middle of the song.

It's not the same as being there (feeling the heat from all the fire, and the explosion don't feel very load at home, but it`s very good.",1443657600,14,624,4.333333333333333

First  - Kudos to Amazon. This was shipped on Thursday (release date)  and I received it today (Saturday).  I love Amazon shipping.  Just finished watching the concert - It's Rammstein - enough said.  Sound and video are superb. The documentary is also amazing. It is really about their first introduction to America and how they have evolved.  Interesting  to watch. They do have English subtitles  when the band is talking, but throughout the video, there  are large  portions/segments  where someone (not sure who, don't think it's any of the band members) is talking  in German  and there are no subtitles. Kind of weird that they have subtitles for everything else.  Regardless, it is still excellent. Highly recommend this DVD",1443225600,7,899,4.88

8728557,5,B013RHZXNG,"Perfect American tour release. This package has it all. After reading other reviews I had to come back and add more: Disc 1 (concert) is a collection of songs that allowed Rammstein to revisit some of their best concert moments and expand on them for America. I was fascinated like a mouse in front of deadly snake. Did I say that Rammstein is deadly? Absolutely. If you don't come away from this concert feeling like you'd just been hit by a cobra, then you weren't watching and lost your hearing; otherwise, you would have been paralyzed to near speechlessness by the experience. Well, of course you could say, ""Yeah! Awesome!"" Or something else equally simplistic. No way you could expand on anything beyond unsophisticated viscera. Disc 2 (documentaries) was two of the most enlightening films Ive seen pertaining to the sociopolitical influence this band had on Earth. Our planets human landscape changed forever because of Rammstein. I don't care if you like them, or not, they had an impact on you even if you were unaware of it. How can I say this? Watch the two films to unlock that mystery. Out",1519344000,2,1104,4.755208333333333
8728558,5,B013RHZXNG,"Outstanding production of the concert. Rammstein, and the whole lighting/pyrotechnics team at this show are incredible.
Til Lindemann has as much stage presence as anyone I have ever seen, and I have been attending some great concerts and plays since 1971. The theatrical elements of the concert elevate it above the rest for me. Watched it 3 times within 5 days, must see for anyone even if you are not a fan of metal/industrial music. The documenty is very good as well, showing some of the history of the band.",1519257600,,513,4.711111111111111
8728559,4,B013RHZXNG,"The DVD came on time and was as shown.  As far as the concert, i'm disappointed.  This is not the Rammstein the fans love.  Very little pyro but you can look past that because the band is so great, they don't need it.  But, this performance was not a good one.  The videos they have on their official channel on YouTube are the good ones  from this concert. With the exception of a few, the performance was mediocre.  It seemed Till did not put much effort into it. The song P***y was horrible, at least in my opinion. Du Hast was a joke. His voice, especially on Ich Tu Dir Weh and Engel was strong and great but the rest, mediocre again. If I had been there, I would have been wondering if I didn't deserve a refund.  I'm still glad I got the DVD and am still a die hard Rammstein fan but, again, I was disappointed in the performance.",1518739200,,837,4.15527950310559

8728561,2,B013RHZXNG,"I'm sure the blu ray concert is awesome. But I bought this specifically because of the included audio CD so I could jam in my car. BOTH of these discs are blu ray encoded. It will sound great in surround sound when I'm home, but I had to drop another 14 bucks for the Paris audio mp3s just to listen on the go :(",1514851200,,312,3.890625
