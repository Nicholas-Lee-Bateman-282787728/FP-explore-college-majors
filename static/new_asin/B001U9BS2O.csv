3797374,5,B001U9BS2O,"I was SO tickled to receive an email about this coming out!  I have been waiting since reruns were on Lifetime years ago.  I've been afraid to watch my vhs tapes (I recorded the reruns) as it's been a *LONG* time for them, and I don't want to kill my VCR.  Happy camper here!",1241654400,,275,4.055555555555555
3797375,5,B001U9BS2O,"There is nothing but good that can be said about the series Thirtysomething.  I do have a question that maybe someone can answer.  Why is Amazon soon to have season 1, when I see other sites offering all 4 seasons on 22 DVDs?  Although those sites have varying prices, price is not the issue but rather were all 4 seasons really released?  Does anyone know why all 4 seasons are supposedly available?  Are these other DVDs legitamate?  (I have no doubt about the authenticity of what is offered here on Amazon.)  Thanks in advance.",1241654400,,531,4.585106382978723
3797376,5,B001U9BS2O,"I am so excited about this DVD release! Can't wait.
The only question I have, Amazon, is why I had to find out from the TV Guide. I've been on the notification list for YEARS and have updated my email as it has changed.
Now that I've complained, I have to say again that I can't wait for this!!!",1241568000,,295,4.016949152542373
3797377,5,B001U9BS2O,"Its about time!!! I have been waiting for nearly 20 years for thirtysomething to come out.... I'm so excited!! I'm definitely going to pre-order, and will anxiously awaiting its arrival in a couple of months.

This was one of the best tv shows ever created. I loved the relationships between the characters, the real-life situations they faced, and the realistic conversations, arguments, love, and feelings they shared.

EDITED TO ADD: 1/5/10
Got the set of Season 1 for Christmas and have been watching it for the past few days-- THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS TO EVER SHOW UP ON TELEVISION!!! Its all about relationships, which I love, the dialogue so well written. I can't wait to have all the seasons on DVD.",1241568000,,712,4.733870967741935
3797378,5,B001U9BS2O,"It's about time!!!!  I've waited, and fumed, and waited and fumed!

Now, if they'll just release it in Blu-ray...  :)",1241395200,4,117,4.75
3797379,5,B001U9BS2O,"Now IVE - I don't think we should take this momentous occasion to bash Northern Exposure, (or WKRP) for releasing subpar editions to the public...on second thought...I'm with you!

This is tremendous news for fans of the show.  My Lifetime VHS tapes recorded in LP mode were starting to lose its tracking ability.  Another Gold Star for Shout Factory!

P.S.  Isn't that a chopped picture?  Isn't Busfield holding their second kid in the original pic?",1241222400,,450,4.933333333333334
3797380,5,B001U9BS2O,I just signed up for the pre-order and I'm so happy have been waiting for so many years.,1241222400,,88,3.9444444444444446
3797381,5,B001U9BS2O,"The L.A. Times has reported that all music rights have apparently cleared, which means that the dvd of this landmark series, unlike Northern Exposure, will retain the spirit of the original with its original soundtrack intact.  Other pluses are the creation of a new master copy (ensuring excellent visual quality) and extensive bonus features, including commentary and interviews.  Each subsequent season will be released at six month intervals.  All great news for fans who have patiently awaited this release for almost 20 years.",1241049600,136,532,5.385542168674699

3797383,5,B001U9BS2O,It is a classic tv series.  Love how they put a human touch in it. You feel like you know everyone,1464393600,,98,3.6666666666666665
3797384,5,B001U9BS2O,"I thought I would think, I watched this! Sometimes when you watch old TV shows there not the same as you remembered. Thirtysomething is still great the characters the house. It's relevant even though people aren't the same as years ago. Couples trying to make sense of their lives and difficulties to be an adult in situations when sometimes they don't want to be there. At the end they don't play the music that they played before.",1463616000,,432,4.623376623376624

3797388,5,B001U9BS2O,Love this show!!,1458000000,,16,4.666666666666667
3797389,4,B001U9BS2O,Loved the series. Watched pilot and was disappointed when I realized series was not prime video. I would have been charged if I didn't catch the fine print. The description on buying video was deceptively confusing. Not at all fair! I don't want to be afraid.or tricked.,1457049600,,270,4.76595744680851
3797390,5,B001U9BS2O,"Love this drama series!!!  I wish it had gone on for 4 more seasons!  Amazing actors, very easy on the eyes.  What a shame it had to end.",1447372800,,137,3.8214285714285716
3797391,3,B001U9BS2O,Pretty good but not as good as Party of Five.,1447286400,,45,3.6
8343173,5,B001U9BS2O,"Groundbreaking series. Had a reputation as a show about a bunch of whining yuppies, but the writing was top-notch and bold. I see echoes of thirtysomething in Six Feet Under and even the Sopranos.  It's a shame it's not available for streaming, would love to re-watch it.",1524528000,,271,4.76595744680851

8343175,2,B001U9BS2O,"Product new but some DVD's wouldn't play. Turned out all I had to do was clean them but they had large smudge marks, it took some effort to clean too, didn't just wipe off. As far as the show, LOVE IT.",1513209600,,201,3.926829268292683
8343176,5,B001U9BS2O,30 stars for 30 something.  This is such an amazinglywell written show With the characters actually saying what they think and converse naturally  It's a shame shows today like This Is Us get lauded for simply following a Quentin Tarantino Time track trick and nothing else.,1498089600,,274,4.934782608695652
8343177,5,B001U9BS2O,Great to have the full first season.,1488153600,,36,4.285714285714286
8343178,3,B001U9BS2O,Not cool that It's not available.  What the heck!? Waited for this for years and was let down to see its unavailable.,1485475200,,117,4.318181818181818
8343179,5,B001U9BS2O,Will later provide review after viewing completion of this DVD set :-),1479340800,,70,4.916666666666667
8343180,4,B001U9BS2O,I watched this show years ago and thought it was great. Now acting has gotten better and I was so irritated by the over acting. The show is so depressing!!,1472774400,,155,4.2
8343181,5,B001U9BS2O,One of the greatest shows ever produced. Real life situations that everyone can relate to.,1466985600,,90,5.066666666666666
