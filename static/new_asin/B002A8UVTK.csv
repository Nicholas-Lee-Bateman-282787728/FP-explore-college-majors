3883517,5,B002A8UVTK,I saw both movies years ago and still love them.  They are now both on 1 DVD.  How convenient!  They have great actors that I love from the 80's.  The 80's movies are the best.  They are full of innocence and adult comedy (meaning light on the sex and language).  I would definitely buy more DVD's like this.,1318809600,,308,4.224137931034483
3883518,5,B002A8UVTK,"For the price that you pay for these two movies, there is really nothing you can complain about.

Both movies are part of a genre that requires you to suspend disbelief.  They're really mild fantasy films for adults.  Whether you're watching Blame It On Rio or The Woman In Red, the theme is generally the same: a married man cheats with a luscious woman.  The plots of both movies work because the cast supports them.  Of course, the two women are attractive and this makes the movie at least half way convincing and worthwhile.  Kelly LeBrock still looks gorgeous now!

Both movies are stored on a dual-layer DVD and you simply select the movie you want to view from the disc's only menu.  There are no scene selection menus at all.  But like I mentioned earlier, you can't complain for the price.  Hence, the full 5-star rating.",1298419200,,831,4.591836734693878
3883519,5,B002A8UVTK,The description for this DVD is TOTALLY wrong. The description is for an Abbott and Costello double feature called Jack and the Beanstalk/Africa Screams. The DVD Blame It on Rio & Women in Red is for a STRONG R rated  comedy DVD containing nudity and adult language and situations. The description needs to be changed immediatly lest an unsuspecting customer orders the item and receives something they did not intend to get.,1268179200,5,425,4.902777777777778

3883521,3,B002A8UVTK,"Blame it on Rio is an excellent movie for your collection. The acting is great and Michelle Johnson, WOW!!!
The Women in Red is a major snorefest. It's awful. Only redeeming value is Kelly le Brock!!!",1433980800,,200,4.583333333333333

3883524,4,B002A8UVTK,"Blame It on Rio is of course a sophomoric romp with an older guy (Michael Caine) / younger girl (Michelle Johnson) romance of the funniest and highest order of ""skin,"" jokes, and the such. A real ""guy"" film for those who aren't dating much :-)) Michelle Johnson was just out of high school in reality and very lovely. Apparently she hasn't done much since 2000 for some reason.

The Woman in Red wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Some typical Wilder schtick, and a beautiful Kelly LeBrock in her film debut but definitely 80's humor.",1425168000,,540,4.510204081632653

3883529,4,B002A8UVTK,these movies were pretty good and you can't beat a two for the proce of one deal and seeing demi moore so young you be like wow she has not changed that much at all,1390521600,,164,3.7142857142857144
3883530,3,B002A8UVTK,"After reading Valerie Harper's autobiography, I, Rhoda, which is good, by the way, I was curious about this movie.  More of a guy flick--especially with all of the gratituitious toplessness--particularly of Michelle Johnson, whom I have never heard of and who was probably just a flash in the pan. I also thought it was really bizarre that Michelle Johnson's character paraded around (on the beach--I know--Rio has ""topless beaches,) in front of her father and went into the water with him like that.  I guess it was all part of the portrayal of a ""sexually liberated woman""--but definitely trampy, if you ask me!  I really don't like The Woman in Red at all, but it was included in this DVD Set.

Michael Caine is always good and Joe Bologna looks good and the acting was fine.  Valerie Harper's part was particularly disappointing, especially when you love the Rhoda character.  She was too dead-pan and serious, but I suppose she had to do what the role and director called for.  Demi Moore had what I call a bit part--she looked very pretty though and not all buff like she became later on--she didn't show herself in this film--this must have been pre-enhancement surgery--plus it was one of her very first movies, I'm guessing.",1369872000,,1233,4.787735849056604
3883531,5,B002A8UVTK,"I've been looking for ""Blame it on Rio"" for years.  I'm so glad to have finally found it.  I found it a couple years ago and bought it online, but it was a European copy and not adaptable to USA DVD players. :(",1368403200,,210,3.86046511627907
3883532,5,B002A8UVTK,The movie Blame it on Rio was delivered promptly and in good condition.  I had seen it about 20 years ago and saw it again recently with my girlfriend.  It is just as funny as ever.,1366243200,,181,4.0
3883533,3,B002A8UVTK,if you like movies about young people well this one is it two movies for the price of one a real good buy these are older movies but collectables,1366243200,,145,4.0344827586206895
3883534,5,B002A8UVTK,"We don't make a practice of watching old movies but these are just too good.  Both movies have been family favorites for many years!

Both movies center around two male characters ""somewhat innocently"" captivated (or enticed) by two beautiful woman, leaving them wondering how they got themselves into this mess!  The supporting cast is outstanding, funny at the right times.  Both Gene Wilder and Michael Caine were perfect choices for these roles.  There are numerous ackward funny scenes that leave you laughing!

enjoy",1360972800,,522,5.228915662650603
3883535,5,B002A8UVTK,"""Blame it on Rio"" is a visually stunning movie for the on-location filming in Rio, and for the astonishing beauty of Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore.  Michelle is only 18 or 19 at the time of filming; Demi Moore is two or three years older.  You will see an ample amount of topless beauties, not only from these young ladies but from the beach scenes.  Michelle is perfect in her role.  Too bad that Demi had a much smaller role.  She was good.  The topper is that this is actually a good, funny movie.  There are plenty of genuine laughs as the plot unfolds.  Michael Caine, Joseph Bologna, and Valerie Harper are all perfectly cast.  The plot concerns the seduction of Caine by Michelle Johnson.

""The Woman in Red"" is a puzzling movie.  It involves Gene Wilder, happily married, yet trying to arrange an affair with a beautiful woman in red.  The slapstick situations and humor just did not cut it for me, although I did have a laugh or two.

There are no extras in the DVD, but at this price just go for it.  You will like ""Blame it on Rio"" if you're a red-blooded man!",1351641600,3,1073,4.353535353535354
3883536,1,B002A8UVTK,i believe the word you were looking for was rare on dvd not collectible dvd with special inserts or a tin can type dvd case...,1347667200,,126,4.08
3883537,5,B002A8UVTK,"both of these movies share a common bond and that is joseph bologna, who was always overlooked by most movie goers but is a terrific actor. michael caine is sensational in this and michele johnson is worth the price,all by herself. in this movie a young demi moore gets forgotten because the other characters are great. the woman in red, gene wilder and kelly lebrock are amazing to watch because of their obvious chemistry and gene wilders comic genious. both of these movies together for one low price was an easy buy.",1344816000,,520,4.663043478260869
3883538,5,B002A8UVTK,"You've seen reviews of the movies, so here's a review of the DVD. I was pleased to discover that both movies use anamorphic widescreen, even though it sells for such a low price (it was $5.99 when I bought it from Amazon). I rate it a 5, even though it has no special features, because it's well worth the price. The picture quality is about as good as possible without going to blu-ray.",1337212800,3,387,4.315068493150685

8359098,3,B002A8UVTK,"These films should be packaged in a brown paper bag.  These aren't so much movies but examples of middle age male wish fulfillment.  That said they'd give Penthouse letters page a run for the money.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  I'm 53 years old and I may or may not have experienced change of life.  They should have added ""Middle Age Crazy"" starring Bruce Dern and Ann-Margret for a true dirty old man trifecta.  The sole reason for ""Blame it on Rio"" existing is to watch the voluptuous Michelle Johnson shed clothing and she gets her kit off with the best of them.  Michael Caine, who actually got paid to get naked with Michelle, gives a creditable performance but he's not the show.  Despite Johnson's obvious physical attributes her acting is of the cigar school Indian variety ergo why she didn't have a sustained career.  Oh, well.  She'll always have Rio.  ""The Women in Red"" is a lighter farce concerning a happily married man (Gene Wilder) obsessed with a high class fashion model (Kelly Le Brock).  Breaks no comedic ground but goes down as easy as a cold beer on a Summer's day.  Stevie Wonder's ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" is on the soundtrack and will reverberate in your head for days.",1473552000,,1214,4.539170506912442
