8535522,1,B002W650P0,Boring and low budget.  Looks like a time share promo.,1427500800,,54,4.4
8535523,4,B002W650P0,This specific group of islands is spectacular in every category! I can't wait to book our next excursion to see them up close and personal.,1373500800,,139,4.6
8535524,1,B002W650P0,"If I could rate this zero, I would've.  I was expecting much more information on this video than it contained.  Only 8 minutes (I should've checked the time before renting).  It only gave a very very brief description of each area.  It had absolutely no depth of information that I need to decide about going there.",1351468800,,315,4.571428571428571
8535525,1,B002W650P0,What a complete waste of money!!!! The actual run time was not 23 minutes as stated but an actual 7 minutes and 47 seconds including 30 seconds of stupid intro by the Travel Video Store !!! The 7 minutes did not show very much either !!! I will not be wasting any more money on anything else under the old title Travelview International series. O stars out of 5 !!!,1264464000,2,365,4.228571428571429
