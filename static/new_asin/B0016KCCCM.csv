3157252,4,B0016KCCCM,"I love this show. L*O*V*E this show. This was a great season, but...well...what happened to the price point? This DVD set has the same number of discs as the first season, the same number of episodes as the first season....why does it cost twice as much? It seems like the price was upped just because the production company knew we'd pay it.",1213488000,3,342,4.532258064516129
3157253,5,B0016KCCCM,"This is the greatest cartoon mini series of all time , it flew by the simpsons , bevuis and butthead , south park , i mean you name it this is the best. Big props to Aaron McGruder.",1213315200,,181,3.789473684210526
3157254,5,B0016KCCCM,"Season 2 wasn't as good as Season 1 but some episodes really stand out like The Hunger Strike, The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show, Home Alone, Invasion of the Katrinians and Stinkmeaner Strikes Back! Aaron McGruder is a genius! I love The Boondocks!",1213142400,,244,4.833333333333333
3157255,5,B0016KCCCM,"We had to wait a long time for season 2 of Boondocks to air, but once it did,Aaron McGruder did not disappoint. The show was still as hilarious and inspiring as ever. There were indeed two episodes that did not air on television, both were aimed at BET. I've seen both episodes on the web (even though lots of websites such as youtube deleted the episodes shortly after they were posted so many people who look for them now cannot find them). If those two episodes are a part of this set i will definitely be buying it, but if they aren't...well, i'll still definitely be buying it.

""What does BET stand for?""
""Uh, Black Entertainment Television?""
""No you fools, Black EVIL Television! Ha, Ha!""

3157256,5,B0016KCCCM,"I found info that this dvd will be uncensored and uncut just like the first season. And not only that, but it's the complete second season, all 15 episodes including the 2 that never aired in the US. So no censorship. It will also contain 4 featurettes, 2 'minisodes', and audio commentaries on selected episodes picked by Aaron McGruder. Enjoy.",1210896000,29,345,4.766666666666667
3157257,4,B0016KCCCM,"I agree with the above reviewer in terms of Boondocks being a great show, I love it. I think it is funny and in many ways true to real life in some cases not everything of course. Episodes like ""Invasion of the Katrinians, and ""The story of Thugnificent"" are hilarious. But the thing I am worried about is what happened to all the episodes?? I did not see any more than maybe 12 to 13 new ones this season, I am not sure if that was due to me not catching them, or if they were just never aired??? If anyone could tell me that would be great but I will buy this for sure for my collection and hope that they continue to make this cartoon even with all the critisism.. Hey if cartoons like South Park, and Family Guy can get away with it on Prime Time TV then who cares what BET or anyone else thinks, IT WILL GET VIEWERS!!!

""As a matter of fact ima go buy me a dog right now, and ima name it Katrinian, and every time it rains ima kick it""",1210550400,5,940,3.9735449735449735
3157258,3,B0016KCCCM,"Don't buy this unless its 15 episodes.

Unconfirmed but probably true:
Two episodes of this show ( The Hunger Strike & The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show ) were not aired. This is rumored to be caused from pressure on Sony from BET ( the source of biting ridicule in the two episodes ).

DO NOT buy this unless _all_ 15 episodes are on the disc.

That said I loved the Boondocks. Season One was great and the thirteen episodes I've seen of Season Two are amazing. Definitely buy if it's un-rated, uncensored, and uncut. Don't bow to censorship.",1209600000,27,539,4.479591836734694

3157278,5,B0016KCCCM,"This season made me think: ""can somebody please make a live action version of soul plane 2: the blackjacking?"" because that was about the funniest thing i ever saw. Air Marshall 50 Cent was hilarious (it's too bad they couldn't get the real 50 Cent into the studio to do the voice).

The two BET-based episodes were hilarious, too. Pretty much every episode of season 2 is classic material. The only episode I was so-so on was ""Ballin"", but even that had a couple of  good laughs in it (especially the opening sequence with the Shaq interview).

IMO, this is the best season of the series.",1461715200,,589,4.537735849056604

BET and its executives should be held accountable just as we demand from other media outlets.

I applaud this work!",1430956800,,379,4.641791044776119

3157322,5,B0016KCCCM,"I have been enjoying The Boondocks since its conception in certine syndicated newspaper comics strips throughout the 90s, so I was delighted to see it become an animated series.

Season two is just as funny and relevant as season one. I love how creator Aaron McGurder provokes intellectual thinking and somehow mixes in crass raw humor to all the episodes.

Huey Freeman is my favorite character because he mirrors my beliefs and outlook on life as well. However all the characters are well written and provide a good symbolisms of all the genre of the social structure in this country.",1393372800,,587,4.86

The characters are funny and original. It does not feel like a black family guy or the simpsons. It feels like its own show. Its also done in a anime style which is great because I think alot of american animators are lazy with blocky designs. One of the best shows I've seen in years. The Boondocks is a must see for anime and adult cartoons fans.,1282608000,,493,4.135416666666667

I have a player and I own the digital licenses to both seasons ( I paid around 24 bucks for each one) and I watch them every day without any problems whatsoever. Besides the excellent digital quality (I have all HD Tvs in my house), both seasons are hilarious as h@ll. Save yourself a few bucks and get the digital copy. You'll no longer have to fumble with DVD's, worry about taking them in and out of the DVD player (unless you have a DVD changer like me... but I still prefer not to fool with it), worry about scratching 'em up, and all the other problems that goes along with owning DVD's.

The language used in the series is definitely colorful but effective and necessary to get cultural points across.  The two minors (voiced by the ever-so-talented Regina King) demonstrate the intellectual awareness of those reminiscent of the late 70s and the almost too impressionable average teenager/young adult of today.  What an amazing contrast.

I could write a treatise on this excellent diamond in the rough.  Watch this if you are particularly into social politics and pop culture.  You will be enlightened and hopefully inspired to change some things...",1265760000,,812,4.970370370370371

This is definitely a must see if you enjoy the first season. My favorite episode is ""home Alone"" I think it's hilarious and you never really get to see Riley and Huey interact. Very good.",1264982400,,356,4.25
3157429,5,B0016KCCCM,"This is a great continuation of the Boondocks series.  It seemed that the whole Season 2 focuses more on the experiences of Riley instead of Huey, who seemed to be the focal point of Season 1.  With Riley, there are more Hip-Hop flavored situations to satirize and funnier situations to laugh at.

I've had the intention on buying this box set for a long time, but have been unwilling to spend thirty or forty bucks on it.  Thankfully, I caught it during the holiday blitz and it was only fifteen bucks during what I suppose was a special.  I look forward to Season 3 airing.

If you're a fan of great satire, great animation and funny-as-all situations, look no further than this.  The Boondocks is a great alternative to ""The Simpsons,"" ""Family Guy"" or ""South Park.""  It's very Afro-centric so finally, something that satirizes the Black Experience is here for any of us to enjoy and laugh at.

The shows are only available in this format. VLC works much better. I am letting go the 30 dollars I paid for the digital formats and just focusing on the DVD for much less, that I will get soon.

So with that said, satires--from literary to cartoons--often push the envelope.  It is very creative in similar ways to the Simpsons or south park.  Although it is funny, it often gets you to think about the society we live in because satires often infuse the truth, sometimes scary truth, into the script.  Of course kids watch it despite the warnings, so it might be important to watch and be able to speak on the show with them.  There are lessons in everything...plus we can't shelter kids from everything, all the time.  I give it five stars because it is pretty much perfect.",1252281600,,751,4.470588235294118

3157443,4,B0016KCCCM,"Aaron McGruder is back with the second season of ""The Boondocks,"" his explosive, brilliantly savage satire of Black American culture and race relations in general.  As anyone who's familiar with ""The Boondocks"" knows, this is a (Japanese) anime-influenced series filtered through the eyes of the two main characters, Huey and Riley Freeman, two uncannily precocious and street-wise Black brothers whose constant, often ribald and unprintable repartee provide a running commentary throughout the show. Another constant is the liberal use of the N-word.  Huey (who fancies himself as an intellectual revolutionary) and Riley (a would-be rapper/gangster) are wards of their ""Grand-dad,"" who's moved them out of the Ghetto and into a largely white suburb.  Neighbors include a mixed-race couple, two young, well off but rabble-rousing White men who speak in Black-oriented slang and street dialect, and the self-hating ""Uncle Ruckus,"" whose constant stream of invective against the Black race defies belief, since Ruckus himself is Black.  Ruckus is perhaps the series' most venomous and controversial figure as he harks back to the pathetic, obedient, toadying slave who desperately longs to be White. Tubby, balding and well into late-middle age, the noisy and ubiquitous Ruckus is used as a working-class stiff who keeps popping up throughout the series in any number of guises, at pivotal moments.  But no one is spared in ""The Boondocks,"" which lampoons everyone, be they male or female, corporate executives, thugs, pimps, gangsters, famous, high-flying celebrities or average Joes.  In Season 2, there is, for example, the scathing spoof of the Black Entertainment Network, when Huey goes on a hunger strike to protest the network's content, which he finds innocuous and damaging.  Meanwhile BET is busy filming a reality show featuring Uncle Ruckus, who constantly extols the virtues of Whites and puts down Blacks while going about any number of dirty, subservient or menial jobs (toilet cleaner, yardman, doorman) . ""Tom, Sarah and Usher"" is about the inanity of celebrity worship, while ""Invasion of the Katrinians"" finds Grand-dad's generosity stretched to the limit after taking in some relatives displaced by Hurricane Katrina.  This episode also underscores the near-unbridgeable cultural and class gaps between ghetto denizens and their wealthier counterparts.  Overall, the show is still funny, but the satirical bite is noticeably more cutting and sour!  In contrast to season 1 (where the humor practically bled through almost every minute), this set was often merely provocative rather than ""ha-ha"" funny.  Even so, I think that Season 2 is still worth checking out!",1233360000,,2682,5.469733656174334

Season two is a step down, but still has the show going strong and laying the social satire, cutting parody, and excessive vulgarity nice and thick while battling the evil forces trying to make the world a stupider place.  Aaron McGruder is a superhero.  Do not doubt this.  Not only did he create a successful and controversial newspaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-strip/dp/0740706098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic strip</a>&nbsp;that lashed out at nearly every reader who came across it and dared them to say they didn't deserve it, but he created an even less friendly animated version pairing the most crude and vulgar content imaginable with even more in-your-face racial commentary and somehow got it aired on basic cable.  Unbelievable.  This man has enriched my life and given me hope for a better future.  God bless him and Cartoon Network.

10 things I love about the Boondocks season two DVD set:
1) Killer kung-fu wolf b!+ches voiced by the heavenly Aisha Tyler.

2) ""Soul Plane"" sequel parodies featuring a mumbling 50 Cent as a heroic air marshal.

3) An episode commenting on the baffling ""no snitching"" culture while simultaneously mocking bluetooth headsets and other useless technology.

4) Katt Williams reprising his role as A Pimp Named Slickback (That is his actual full name. Like A Tribe Called Quest) to act as marriage counselor to an emasculated Tom Dubois.  Example: ""Has NOT hitting the b!+ch been working? I mean, scientifically speaking, has not hitting the b!+ch achieved the desired result?""

5) Lines like ""It's not the fact that you clearly have a possessed man tied to a bed upstairs...it's that you lied about it.""  GOLD!

6) Watching the voice actors at work on the extras with the N-bombs all cut together.

7) Spending an entire episode systematically linking gay and hip-hop cultures while puzzling about how rappers and those who idolize them could be so homophobic.  Then giving you the answer.  Come out of the closet already, Fiddy.

8) Not one, but TWO unaired episodes blasting the corporate ignorance-peddlers known as BET for their incessant mongering of negative black stereotypes to the world at large. Talk about selling out your own people.

9) Not one but TWO episodes parodying a certain overweight, overexposed media hog posing as a civil rights activist for personal gain.

10) Showing us the truth behind snarky Fox News darling Ann Coulter's parade of ignorance. Speaking of hot conservative bee-yatches, I long for the day when Michelle Malkin's racist BS comes back on her and Rupert Murdoch only allows her to speak using the Vietnamese prostitute's lines from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>.  ""Me so horny, baby.""

What else is there to say?  This show still swings for the fences, devours every sacred cow, pays homage to the finer things in life (like Bruce Lee flicks), and causes fits of laughter that could be mistaken by a passerby for epilepsy. There are a few bits that don't work out as well as they could have (did we need an entire episode about Usher macking on somebody's wife?) and the gaps in production are starting to take a toll, but I still can't get enough of ""The Boondocks"". There is no more socially relevant series out there and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B0006Z2L38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>&nbsp;dares not tread where this show lives.  It asks the hard questions and delivers the answers that some may not want to hear, but that's reality.  This is the show that dared to wonder aloud in it's very first season just what the immortal Martin Luther King Jr. would think of what his people have done with the freedom he and so many others sacrificed so much for.

Uncalled-for message from the soapbox incoming.

Screw BET, Fox News, MTV, and every other corporate entity feeding and profiting from our country's ignorance epidemic.  Why bother teaching pride in one's race while glorifying ill-gotten material wealth, demeaning women, promoting violence, and ridiculing any sign of intelligence?  Every person who sees a person different them them, be it ethnicity, nationality, religion, or political party and sees them as the other side only plays into the divide-and-conquer strategy that allows us all to be perpetually exploited by those in power. And as for an entire cable channel that claims to represent the values of entire race, what happened to ""a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character""?  What kind of character is being fostered in American culture by the garbage on BET and MTV?  Forget race.  That's WHAT you are.  What matters is WHO you are.  This is what Dr. King taught, this is what Boondocks preaches, and this is what I personally believe.  But it's way funnier when Boondocks tells it.

3157448,5,B0016KCCCM,"I see quite a few reviews here stating that season 2 is not as good as season 1. I beg to differ, i feel that this series has gone on a more robust creative direction with this second season, in the aspect that more character development from the rest of the characters is seen with separate episodes dedicated to them and with a lesser emphasis on Huey.

I feel the momentum of the earlier season has not waned a bit and is seen solidly in season 2 as well with a lot more laughs and risque.

One must also understand that for a comic animated series, the true strength of the Boondocks series lies with the voice over actors and their talents for the characters they 'voice'.

That being said, there are a few points that i wish to make:

1. Regina King's voice-over on riley was faltering a bit on this season.
2. The frontal nudity of Grandad was a bit 'ugh' and imo, uneccessary.
3. Critique of stereo-type itself becomes a stereo-type and a cliche after awhile.
4. While the Katrina episode was funny and made a realistic point (selfish vs. lazy), i feel aaron was dancing on the edge with that one.
5. sometimes the dialogs themselves are a bit inaudible and incomprehensible (more so in context) and one has to rewind to listen.

These are just minute observations, this season like the earlier one is a Laugh Riot and a must have in your collection (just make sure its away from the kids!) :)

If you have never seen the Boondocks, please purchase season 1 before purchasing season 2. There are season 1 continuation episodes in season 2. Regina King is amazing! How she can pull off the voices of the two main characters is truly amazing! Looking forward to season 3.",1221091200,,421,4.626666666666667
3157453,2,B0016KCCCM,"Aaron McGruder's thinly veiled self hate from Season 1 has devolved into a full-blown call for self destruction here in Season 2. The insightfulness and humor that made the first season so funny are gone, replaced by harsh invective and boundary-pushing for the sake of seeing how much the producers can get away with.

The first season of Boondocks was freer and smarter than the strip and slowly won me over. I looked forward to Season 2, but after watching it am sorely disappointed in the wasted potential. There are a few funny moments spread throughout these three discs, but they don't make up for the rest of the garbage on display. And the social criticism is all but gone.

The stand out episode of this collection is ""Invasion of the Katrinians,"" a well played, funny, accurate appraisal of the fall out from Hurricane Katrina. In this episode Granddad and the boys take in some extended family from New Orleans. This one episode lampoons everything from bleeding heart do gooders to the misinterpreting media to the so called ""victims"" who might not be above a little opportunism in the face of tragedy.

Unfortunately, the rest of the episodes are typified by ""The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show,"" an episode which looks like it actually mirrors the producers' motivations. In it, BET and a stand-in for Reginald Hudlin (President of Entertainment for BET and executive producer of the Boondocks) seek to air a television series so vile and destructive to the African-American image that it actually hastens the destruction of Blacks in America. Sadly, the plot line for this episode doesn't seem to be too far away from the reality of the Boondocks: Season 2.",1220745600,7,1668,4.886925795053004

However, every episode of this season deserves watching, and most provide scenes of absolute hilarity.  This is a brilliant show that explores and challenges the complexities of socioracial and socioeconomic ideologies in the United States, and it hits the nail on the head (to be cliche) every time.

I would have probably bought this season just for the BET episodes, but was pleased to find that the whole season is much more than palatable, but uproarious.  As with most good comedies, you can watch this show 10 times before catching every piece of comedic subtly along with the more overtly funny aspects of the show.

Boondocks is an excellent satirical mirror for African Americans to view and give careful thought to a number of issues.  High praises are warranted for the BET episodes.  We constantly are reminded that entertainers are not the parents to our children. However, there should be some sense of social responsibility. Are you listening BET? We learn from Huey Freeman about numerous pertinent issues each episode. However, our trauma, lack of meaningful therapy to remedy generations of social and systemic hostility, and self-loathing are expertly personified through Uncle Ruckus. Unfortunately, given the magnitude of how we tend to over represent society's ills, Uncle Ruckus will continue portray an ironic credibility.",1216771200,,812,5.68595041322314

3157469,5,B0016KCCCM,The Boondocks second season is masterful. The satire is ingenious and the comedy is hilarious. The characters represent different factions of the black community and different people will identify with different characters. Riley is the present hip hop generation and unfortunately you can hear many of his statements coming out of the mouths of grown men. Huey is an intellectual and pro black like the hip hop of the 80s and 90s. Grandapa is the civil rights generation and Uncle Ruckus is the embodiment of the self hating black man. Tom the ultimate integrationist. The Boondocks takes very touchy subjects and with the skillfull use of a cartoon brings them to light. The effeminization (homo thugs) of hip hop is one of the subjects he handles. The banned BET segment says a lot about what this country will allow and what they wont. Whether you think the Boondocks is deep social and political commentary or just a silly funny cartoon is up to you but I highly recommend it,1216252800,5,980,4.804733727810651

Season two is just as funny and relevant as season one. I love how creator Aaron McGurder provokes intellectual thinking and somehow mixes in crass raw humor to all the episodes.

3391898,5,B0016KCCCM,This show is a perfect example of how  to do a show wih no restrictions. Aaron McGruder did it right. All but 1 episode is great on this season. The characters are funny and original. It does not feel like a black family guy or the simpsons. It feels like its own show. Its also done in a anime style which is great because I think alot of american animators are lazy with blocky designs. One of the best shows I've seen in years. The Boondocks is a must see for anime and adult cartoons fans.,1282608000,,493,4.135416666666667

I have a player and I own the digital licenses to both seasons ( I paid around 24 bucks for each one) and I watch them every day without any problems whatsoever. Besides the excellent digital quality (I have all HD Tvs in my house), both seasons are hilarious as h@ll. Save yourself a few bucks and get the digital copy. You'll no longer have to fumble with DVD's, worry about taking them in and out of the DVD player (unless you have a DVD changer like me... but I still prefer not to fool with it), worry about scratching 'em up, and all the other problems that goes along with owning DVD's.

The language used in the series is definitely colorful but effective and necessary to get cultural points across.  The two minors (voiced by the ever-so-talented Regina King) demonstrate the intellectual awareness of those reminiscent of the late 70s and the almost too impressionable average teenager/young adult of today.  What an amazing contrast.

I could write a treatise on this excellent diamond in the rough.  Watch this if you are particularly into social politics and pop culture.  You will be enlightened and hopefully inspired to change some things...",1265760000,,812,4.970370370370371

3391905,5,B0016KCCCM,This show is absolutely fearless and is thought provoking with its biting satire. This season is not for the faint hearted and we need more shows like this. The packaging is basic but there are some nice commentaries with Aaron McGruder and some of the producers for some of the episodes.,1265068800,,288,4.666666666666667
3391906,5,B0016KCCCM,"I love this show. I believe the second season is a lot better than the first one! I loved the first but the second one has a lot more laughs. Gangstalicious is classic. This is definitely a must see if you enjoy the first season. My favorite episode is ""home Alone"" I think it's hilarious and you never really get to see Riley and Huey interact. Very good.",1264982400,,356,4.25
3391926,5,B0016KCCCM,"This is a great continuation of the Boondocks series.  It seemed that the whole Season 2 focuses more on the experiences of Riley instead of Huey, who seemed to be the focal point of Season 1.  With Riley, there are more Hip-Hop flavored situations to satirize and funnier situations to laugh at.

I've had the intention on buying this box set for a long time, but have been unwilling to spend thirty or forty bucks on it.  Thankfully, I caught it during the holiday blitz and it was only fifteen bucks during what I suppose was a special.  I look forward to Season 3 airing.

If you're a fan of great satire, great animation and funny-as-all situations, look no further than this.  The Boondocks is a great alternative to ""The Simpsons,"" ""Family Guy"" or ""South Park.""  It's very Afro-centric so finally, something that satirizes the Black Experience is here for any of us to enjoy and laugh at.  Anyone can enjoy ""The Boondocks"" and appreciate the comedy that ensues with each episode.",1261180800,,986,4.686046511627907
3391927,5,B0016KCCCM,"Even funnier than the first season (if that's possible).  There are more scenes with Uncle Ruckus and ""A Pimp Name Slickback"" is off the chain.  If you liked the first one, you will absolutely love this DVD.  Go get it now!!",1260835200,,224,4.414634146341464

I can't play it in VLC player, for obvious reason. It only works in Windows Media Player 11. That is terrible. It is slow and it does not work when I download and install it. The shows are only available in this format. VLC works much better. I am letting go the 30 dollars I paid for the digital formats and just focusing on the DVD for much less, that I will get soon. From that I can play with VLC and actually be able to play on my computer with no hassles. If you are looking for any media, besides MP3, just get the DVD and rip it with VLC

I enjoyed the second season as much as I did the first.,1255305600,,253,3.8461538461538463

So with that said, satires--from literary to cartoons--often push the envelope.  It is very creative in similar ways to the Simpsons or south park.  Although it is funny, it often gets you to think about the society we live in because satires often infuse the truth, sometimes scary truth, into the script.  Of course kids watch it despite the warnings, so it might be important to watch and be able to speak on the show with them.  There are lessons in everything...plus we can't shelter kids from everything, all the time.  I give it five stars because it is pretty much perfect.",1252281600,,751,4.470588235294118

3391940,4,B0016KCCCM,"Aaron McGruder is back with the second season of ""The Boondocks,"" his explosive, brilliantly savage satire of Black American culture and race relations in general.  As anyone who's familiar with ""The Boondocks"" knows, this is a (Japanese) anime-influenced series filtered through the eyes of the two main characters, Huey and Riley Freeman, two uncannily precocious and street-wise Black brothers whose constant, often ribald and unprintable repartee provide a running commentary throughout the show. Another constant is the liberal use of the N-word.  Huey (who fancies himself as an intellectual revolutionary) and Riley (a would-be rapper/gangster) are wards of their ""Grand-dad,"" who's moved them out of the Ghetto and into a largely white suburb.  Neighbors include a mixed-race couple, two young, well off but rabble-rousing White men who speak in Black-oriented slang and street dialect, and the self-hating ""Uncle Ruckus,"" whose constant stream of invective against the Black race defies belief, since Ruckus himself is Black.  Ruckus is perhaps the series' most venomous and controversial figure as he harks back to the pathetic, obedient, toadying slave who desperately longs to be White. Tubby, balding and well into late-middle age, the noisy and ubiquitous Ruckus is used as a working-class stiff who keeps popping up throughout the series in any number of guises, at pivotal moments.  But no one is spared in ""The Boondocks,"" which lampoons everyone, be they male or female, corporate executives, thugs, pimps, gangsters, famous, high-flying celebrities or average Joes.  In Season 2, there is, for example, the scathing spoof of the Black Entertainment Network, when Huey goes on a hunger strike to protest the network's content, which he finds innocuous and damaging.  Meanwhile BET is busy filming a reality show featuring Uncle Ruckus, who constantly extols the virtues of Whites and puts down Blacks while going about any number of dirty, subservient or menial jobs (toilet cleaner, yardman, doorman) . ""Tom, Sarah and Usher"" is about the inanity of celebrity worship, while ""Invasion of the Katrinians"" finds Grand-dad's generosity stretched to the limit after taking in some relatives displaced by Hurricane Katrina.  This episode also underscores the near-unbridgeable cultural and class gaps between ghetto denizens and their wealthier counterparts.  Overall, the show is still funny, but the satirical bite is noticeably more cutting and sour!  In contrast to season 1 (where the humor practically bled through almost every minute), this set was often merely provocative rather than ""ha-ha"" funny.  Even so, I think that Season 2 is still worth checking out!",1233360000,,2682,5.469733656174334

Season two is a step down, but still has the show going strong and laying the social satire, cutting parody, and excessive vulgarity nice and thick while battling the evil forces trying to make the world a stupider place.  Aaron McGruder is a superhero.  Do not doubt this.  Not only did he create a successful and controversial newspaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/comic-strip/dp/0740706098/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">comic strip</a>&nbsp;that lashed out at nearly every reader who came across it and dared them to say they didn't deserve it, but he created an even less friendly animated version pairing the most crude and vulgar content imaginable with even more in-your-face racial commentary and somehow got it aired on basic cable.  Unbelievable.  This man has enriched my life and given me hope for a better future.  God bless him and Cartoon Network.

10 things I love about the Boondocks season two DVD set:
1) Killer kung-fu wolf b!+ches voiced by the heavenly Aisha Tyler.

2) ""Soul Plane"" sequel parodies featuring a mumbling 50 Cent as a heroic air marshal.

3) An episode commenting on the baffling ""no snitching"" culture while simultaneously mocking bluetooth headsets and other useless technology.

4) Katt Williams reprising his role as A Pimp Named Slickback (That is his actual full name. Like A Tribe Called Quest) to act as marriage counselor to an emasculated Tom Dubois.  Example: ""Has NOT hitting the b!+ch been working? I mean, scientifically speaking, has not hitting the b!+ch achieved the desired result?""

5) Lines like ""It's not the fact that you clearly have a possessed man tied to a bed upstairs...it's that you lied about it.""  GOLD!

6) Watching the voice actors at work on the extras with the N-bombs all cut together.

7) Spending an entire episode systematically linking gay and hip-hop cultures while puzzling about how rappers and those who idolize them could be so homophobic.  Then giving you the answer.  Come out of the closet already, Fiddy.

8) Not one, but TWO unaired episodes blasting the corporate ignorance-peddlers known as BET for their incessant mongering of negative black stereotypes to the world at large. Talk about selling out your own people.

9) Not one but TWO episodes parodying a certain overweight, overexposed media hog posing as a civil rights activist for personal gain.

10) Showing us the truth behind snarky Fox News darling Ann Coulter's parade of ignorance. Speaking of hot conservative bee-yatches, I long for the day when Michelle Malkin's racist BS comes back on her and Rupert Murdoch only allows her to speak using the Vietnamese prostitute's lines from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>.  ""Me so horny, baby.""

What else is there to say?  This show still swings for the fences, devours every sacred cow, pays homage to the finer things in life (like Bruce Lee flicks), and causes fits of laughter that could be mistaken by a passerby for epilepsy. There are a few bits that don't work out as well as they could have (did we need an entire episode about Usher macking on somebody's wife?) and the gaps in production are starting to take a toll, but I still can't get enough of ""The Boondocks"". There is no more socially relevant series out there and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park/dp/B0006Z2L38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park</a>&nbsp;dares not tread where this show lives.  It asks the hard questions and delivers the answers that some may not want to hear, but that's reality.  This is the show that dared to wonder aloud in it's very first season just what the immortal Martin Luther King Jr. would think of what his people have done with the freedom he and so many others sacrificed so much for.

Uncalled-for message from the soapbox incoming.

Screw BET, Fox News, MTV, and every other corporate entity feeding and profiting from our country's ignorance epidemic.  Why bother teaching pride in one's race while glorifying ill-gotten material wealth, demeaning women, promoting violence, and ridiculing any sign of intelligence?  Every person who sees a person different them them, be it ethnicity, nationality, religion, or political party and sees them as the other side only plays into the divide-and-conquer strategy that allows us all to be perpetually exploited by those in power. And as for an entire cable channel that claims to represent the values of entire race, what happened to ""a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character""?  What kind of character is being fostered in American culture by the garbage on BET and MTV?  Forget race.  That's WHAT you are.  What matters is WHO you are.  This is what Dr. King taught, this is what Boondocks preaches, and this is what I personally believe.  But it's way funnier when Boondocks tells it.

3391945,5,B0016KCCCM,"I see quite a few reviews here stating that season 2 is not as good as season 1. I beg to differ, i feel that this series has gone on a more robust creative direction with this second season, in the aspect that more character development from the rest of the characters is seen with separate episodes dedicated to them and with a lesser emphasis on Huey.

I feel the momentum of the earlier season has not waned a bit and is seen solidly in season 2 as well with a lot more laughs and risque.

One must also understand that for a comic animated series, the true strength of the Boondocks series lies with the voice over actors and their talents for the characters they 'voice'.

That being said, there are a few points that i wish to make:

1. Regina King's voice-over on riley was faltering a bit on this season.
2. The frontal nudity of Grandad was a bit 'ugh' and imo, uneccessary.
3. Critique of stereo-type itself becomes a stereo-type and a cliche after awhile.
4. While the Katrina episode was funny and made a realistic point (selfish vs. lazy), i feel aaron was dancing on the edge with that one.
5. sometimes the dialogs themselves are a bit inaudible and incomprehensible (more so in context) and one has to rewind to listen.

These are just minute observations, this season like the earlier one is a Laugh Riot and a must have in your collection (just make sure its away from the kids!) :)

3391950,2,B0016KCCCM,"Aaron McGruder's thinly veiled self hate from Season 1 has devolved into a full-blown call for self destruction here in Season 2. The insightfulness and humor that made the first season so funny are gone, replaced by harsh invective and boundary-pushing for the sake of seeing how much the producers can get away with.

The first season of Boondocks was freer and smarter than the strip and slowly won me over. I looked forward to Season 2, but after watching it am sorely disappointed in the wasted potential. There are a few funny moments spread throughout these three discs, but they don't make up for the rest of the garbage on display. And the social criticism is all but gone.

The stand out episode of this collection is ""Invasion of the Katrinians,"" a well played, funny, accurate appraisal of the fall out from Hurricane Katrina. In this episode Granddad and the boys take in some extended family from New Orleans. This one episode lampoons everything from bleeding heart do gooders to the misinterpreting media to the so called ""victims"" who might not be above a little opportunism in the face of tragedy.

Unfortunately, the rest of the episodes are typified by ""The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show,"" an episode which looks like it actually mirrors the producers' motivations. In it, BET and a stand-in for Reginald Hudlin (President of Entertainment for BET and executive producer of the Boondocks) seek to air a television series so vile and destructive to the African-American image that it actually hastens the destruction of Blacks in America. Sadly, the plot line for this episode doesn't seem to be too far away from the reality of the Boondocks: Season 2.",1220745600,7,1668,4.886925795053004

This is a brilliant show that explores and challenges the complexities of socioracial and socioeconomic ideologies in the United States, and it hits the nail on the head (to be cliche) every time.

I would have probably bought this season just for the BET episodes, but was pleased to find that the whole season is much more than palatable, but uproarious.

We constantly are reminded that entertainers are not the parents to our children. However, there should be some sense of social responsibility. Are you listening BET? We learn from Huey Freeman about numerous pertinent issues each episode. However, our trauma, lack of meaningful therapy to remedy generations of social and systemic hostility, and self-loathing are expertly personified through Uncle Ruckus.

3391966,5,B0016KCCCM,The Boondocks second season is masterful. The satire is ingenious and the comedy is hilarious. The characters represent different factions of the black community and different people will identify with different characters. Riley is the present hip hop generation and unfortunately you can hear many of his statements coming out of the mouths of grown men. Huey is an intellectual and pro black like the hip hop of the 80s and 90s. Grandapa is the civil rights generation and Uncle Ruckus is the embodiment of the self hating black man. Tom the ultimate integrationist. The Boondocks takes very touchy subjects and with the skillfull use of a cartoon brings them to light. The effeminization (homo thugs) of hip hop is one of the subjects he handles. The banned BET segment says a lot about what this country will allow and what they wont.

I received the second season DVD box set for father's day and have to say I was very impressed with the storyboard and subject matter of the series. A definite must have DVD; if you love David Chappelle, Chris Rock, or Eddie Murphy you'll love this series. Support the artist and cast of The Boondocks and purchase (not burn) this DVD box set.",1213660800,,477,4.494252873563219
