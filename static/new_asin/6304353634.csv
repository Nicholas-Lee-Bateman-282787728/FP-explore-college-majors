847015,5,6304353634,"I loved (and still love) this movie.  It is an action-horror movie based on a true story in Africa.  The DVD that I have is the one with the red cover that came out in 1996.  I have seen this movie many times, but it never gets old to me.  One reviewer called this a ""3-star movie,"" but I totally disagree with that.  To me, it's a ""5-star movie"" all the way, and I don't give many movies 5 stars.  If you invest in this movie, you will be glad you did!  I plan to buy the blu-ray as soon as it comes out.",1517961600,,505,3.798076923076923

847099,5,6304353634,"I love the suspense of this movie.  The actors are marvelous, and it's based on a true story. Now I have to go to Chicago and see the actual lions!",1514246400,,147,3.9
847100,5,6304353634,"The Ghost and the Darkness was a fantastic and thrilling adventure movie about the real-life story of the Tsavo man-eating lions.  I enjoyed the performances of all the actors especially Val Kilmer as Col. John Patterson.

This movie is somewhat scary and has some very violent moments so I would suggest younger viewers and anyone with anxiety about animal attacks stay away.  Otherwise, this movie was a thrilling hunting story that should keep you entertained and maybe on the edge of your seat.

This film had few funny moments as it focuses almost entirely on the threat of the lions even when they aren't on the screen.  A thriller but not much of the adventurous tone of movies like Indiana Jones.  Almost like a monster movie featuring real animals.",1512345600,,757,4.829457364341085
847101,4,6304353634,"A good movie, well worth watching.  Be warned though, there are some scenes of animal attacks.  I will not go into detail about said animal attacks though because I don't want to ruin the movie.",1511049600,,194,4.514285714285714
847102,4,6304353634,"Even though this is more of a 3 star movie, I am bumping it up to 4 stars because I really like Val Kilmer & Michael Douglas, and also the concept that it is based on a true story/true events that really happened. It was pretty interesting doing extra web crawling to learn more about the events. I am sure the special effects were super for the time that this was released, but it's a bit cheesy by today's standards. The script isn't earth shattering, and the plot is a little 1 dimensional, i.e. no twists and turns. It does keep moving along and there are plenty of ""I just jumped in my seat"" moments.",1510444800,,605,4.269565217391304

847173,5,6304353634,"One of the most classic movie of American style. Five stars for the movie. But in fact, the two lions displayed in Field Museum are female, which are on the contrary of the males shown in the story.",1507939200,,198,4.2368421052631575
847174,5,6304353634,Enjoyed the movie so much I bought it so I can watch it over and over,1507420800,,69,3.375
847175,5,6304353634,"Contrary to the 1/2 star offered by Robert Ebert (insane), we've watched this film at least 3 distinct times over the years. If we ever visit Chicago, we will go to see 'The Ghost' and 'The Darkness' - the Tsavo Man-Eaters on display in the Field Museum of Natural History.

The Tsavo Man-Eaters were a pair of man-eating Tsavo lions responsible for the deaths of a number of construction workers on the Kenya-Uganda Railway from March through December 1898. The significance of this pair of lions was their unusual behavior, such as the number of men killed and the manner of the attacks.

This movie has so many dimensions that warrant 5 stars that we can't even list them all. A compelling story based on real events. Bring popcorn, or you'll chew your nails off. All 10 of them! Enjoy 5x",1507161600,2,791,4.602836879432624

This DVD was the September 12, 2017 version; I figured this is 2017, surely the quality is better than any other before it. Nope.

847253,5,6304353634,"This has always been one of my favorite movies. It is a very intense movie, and the fact that it is based on a true story just makes it that much more amazing. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for a thriller/horror-esque movie. As one of my friends likes to say, this is kind of like ""Jaws"" on land.",1504051200,,314,4.163934426229508

847317,2,6304353634,"I like the movie but I have to clarify a portion of the description of the location where the depicted events supposedly happened. The Tsavo River is not and never has been located in Uganda, it is located in Kenya. The description of the events could not have happened in Uganda since the river is located in the coastal area in Southern Kenya. The railway was build from the Kenyan Mombasa coast to Kampala, Uganda. Historical accuracy matters when a 'story' is based on historically related events.",1502409600,,501,4.7701149425287355

I am not sure but isn't it the female lion that does most of the killing? It emphasizes the superstitions of many cultures. This really did happen and to me, life is much more interesting than fiction. Older movie, good acting, nothing bad about this movie. Entertaining? Yes.",1499558400,,399,4.541666666666667

That was several years ago and I decided to watch it again last night. I am so glad that I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it for the most part. This is probably Val Kilmer's 2nd best film (His greatest as Doc Holiday in Tombstone)....Michael Douglas....not so much.

The African scenics are breathtaking, and the conflicts between labor and management are exciting indeed, with lessons to be learned for the 21st Century.

847602,3,6304353634,"Fascinating concept, done a bit ""over the top"" with the drama.  Val Kilmer and Michale Douglas plus the rest of the supporting cast does fine acting.  The way the story is told just keeps me from saying ""I like it.""  Way to much effort fantasizing the story instead of telling it for the true superlative hunting experience that it should be.  I almost turned it off mid-way though but decided too ""gut it out"" and watched it through the end.  It was worth watching to the end.  One of the few movies that doesn't rely upon nudity to keep an audience entertained. This is a movie acceptable for the whole family!

847603,5,6304353634,"This is ""Jaws"" on steroids (but with lions instead of a shark, and with many more people being eaten... up close and personal).  The score by Jerry Goldsmith is terrific.  The direction is almost unbearably suspenseful.  The characters are unforgettable.  The acting is good.  It's a borderline supernatural horror movie, and so will not be everyone's cup of tea, yet it is approximately true, based on the self-aggrandizing, 19th-Century memoir of its main character.  There's a bit of the spirit of Captain Ahab and Moby Dick in this movie too, although it's got a happier ending than Melville's novel, This movie is also to lions what the movie ""Backdraft"" was to fire!  You'll never get a closer look at real lions, nor a more heart-pounding Jaws-like finale.  Real lions used throughout, though not as big as the nine-foot (!) lions of the historical event, two of which are now preserved in Chicago's Fields Museum. If you're not squeamish, this is an awesome suspense movie.",1492041600,,981,4.939024390243903

847607,3,6304353634,"This is a very good movie.  Probably my favorite Val Kilmer movie.  I've never been a big fan of his.  He always seemed like he was more important to himself then he really is.  Michael Douglas gets top billing in this.  He doesn't have as much screen time.  And doesn't have as a good of a role.  This is based on a true story.  And I don't remember the name but there was also a movie from the '50s or the 60s that I saw later with Stewart Granger that was about this same thing.
Other then the movie I don't know too much about the real story.  And in the introduction they say that even the most incredible things are true.  Yeah right.  They have lions climbing trees.  The English are trying to build a railroad in Africa and a lot of the workers are disappearing.  The movie is exciting and intense.  It reminds me a little of The Edge.  Which makes me want to ask the question would I rather be eaten by a bear or a lion.",1491523200,,929,4.083333333333333

847708,3,6304353634,"Released in 1996 and directed by Stephen Hopkins from William Goldmans script, The Ghost and the Darkness  is an African adventure based on the true events of two man-eating lions responsible for the deaths of scores of bridge construction workers on the Kenya-Uganda Railway from March through December 1898. The lions were dubbed The Ghost and The Darkness by the workers and thought perhaps to be demons. Val Kilmer plays real-life military engineer Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, who was commissioned to carry out the project.

The addition of Michael Douglas as a charismatic great white hunter, Remington, is fictional, as Patterson pretty much hunted and killed the rogue lions on his own. Some claim that Douglas ruined the movie by using his clout to enlarge his part, but his character is only in the movie for 49 minutes as it is.  Another deviation is that neither of the male lions had huge manes, as depicted; Tsavo lions possess either minimal manes or none at all. Interestingly, the two lions are on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Patterson claimed that these big cats were responsible for up to 135 deaths; however, an official paper states that only about 2831 killings can be verified, but this figure does not take into account all those who were killed but not eaten by lions.

Ive always had mixed feelings about this movie, which can be witnessed in the fact that some people lambaste it (e.g. Roger Eberts scathing review) while others laud it as a great or near-great adventure flick (the movie won an Academy award for Best Sound Effects). Im in the middle. I think the actors and their characters are great. Kilmer curiously won a Razzie for his performance, which is inexplicable because he makes a great protagonist, taking the material serious with a low-key performance rather than a melodramatic one. Douglas takes the more megalomaniacal approach, but Im pretty sure thats the way a lot of great white hunters were, cartoony though it may be. The locations, costuming and cinematography are also great, as are the lions and the creature F/X.

The problem lies with the story, or the way its told. The entire movie revolves around the lions attacking the personnel and the corresponding hunt to kill them. This is fine except that theres not enough human interest for a feature film of 110 minutes. A solid half hour could have easily been cut, making for a more compelling watch. Better yet, they shouldve given the characters greater dimension with more poignant dialogue and character-defining episodes, as was done in Jaws (1975), for example. I suppose it doesnt help that there are no primary female characters, although Emily Mortimer has a bit part as Pattersons wife.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Tom Wilkinson plays the bastage financier of the project while John Kani and Om Puri appear as foremen. Bernard Hill plays the requisite doctor while Brian McCardie is on hand as a British supervisor.

The movie was shot in Kenya and South Africa.

847853,2,6304353634,"Pretty bad. Val Kilmer, who I think is a great actor, was almost a non presence. Michael Douglas, whose character is completely fictional, feels literally thrown in there randomly. He's so out of place and irritating, its a really bad performance. He's kinda a rip off of Quint from Jaws. Come to think of it there's quite a few things reminiscent of Jaws. Everytime the lions come on screen there's a two note riff like from Jaws. Dah Dah, Dah Dah. Even towards the end before the big fight there's a scene of them drinking and bonding just like the scene from Jaws. Bottom line is this movie is a generic thriller/adventure movie when it could've been so much more. It's greatest sin is that it's just plain boring. There's hardly an interesting character, quite a few laugh out loud unintentionally funny scenes, and it's clearly trying too hard. The story from which it's based on is actually pretty interesting, but The Ghost and the Darkness fails to translate that to the screen. I can't recommend this.",1479081600,,1010,4.711864406779661

It does take some liberties with the facts (the Field Museum in Chicago makes no mention of a hunter named Remington, Michael Douglas's character, and the man-eaters were maneless male lions, unlike the ones depicted in the film). Nonetheless, those lions did eat 140 railway workers in East Africa in 1898 until engineer John Patterson killed them.

848469,4,6304353634,"A stellar and criminally underrated feature that was unjustly panned by critics around the time of its release. Ghost and the Darkness takes some pages from Spielberg's own Jaws and throws in a true story (albeit with some major artistic liberties) to boot. The characters are all likable and the night banter between the leads, especially when Douglas' Remington arrives, flows naturally and gives a strong sense of camaraderie. The effects are strong and practical and the film knows how to ratchet up the tension beautifully. It's a great adventure flick that has some very tense moments, great cinematography and a nice even pace.

However, while the effects, acting, script and cinematography are all quite good, the film's strongest feature is its soundtrack. Composed by the late Jerry Goldsmith (and one of his best in my opinion) the score is pulsing, emotional and has a distinct tribal flair that makes it a real standout. The main theme itself also recalls period adventure films and really lends to the film's setting.

As said before, the film does take some artistic liberties for sake of drama and character. For instance, the Remington character is completely fictional and Patterson hunted and killed the lions on his own. The male lions in the film are also maned, whereas the actual lions, and lions from the area, do not actually have manes. I imagine this was for aesthetic purposes and to avoid confusion with the audience, who likely aren't aware of the types of lions that live in the region.",1461715200,4,1517,4.9450980392156865

849011,4,6304353634,"As a history teacher, I make a point of showing clips of this film to encapsulate what European imperialism in Africa looked like. Although the movie has some glaring inaccuracies from the original account of JH Patterson, the representation of the ""spirit"" of the period is superb. If you're a teacher, try showing the opening clip (where Beaumont says they're saving Africa from the Africans) and the arrival of Patterson and Starling in Tsaavo, where you can see three white men in charge of hundreds of multi-ethnic Africans and Indians, both Hindu, Muslim and traditional. Samuel as a ""Christianized"" African camp liaison is also a great lesson point as well as the line where the Indian foreman says ""of course you can do anything, you're white!""  I agree with other reviewers in that the addition of Remington was needless and that Douglas' character hammed it up with his stereotypical trigger-happy wild-eyed American hunter trope.

849360,5,6304353634,"Fantastic movie which is roughly historically accurate.  The two (or possibly more) lions came to regard the railroad camp as a kind of smorgasbord and held up the building of the British East African railroad in Tsavo for several months.  Some professional and amateur hunters did try to kill the lions but the professional hunter played by Michael Douglas is fictional.  The stuffed and mounted lions really are on display in Chicago.  I have seen them.  There are several books and other written accounts of the incident.  The movie is grand adventure and horror with beautiful cinematography and good acting.  Those who complain of Val Kilmer's stiff performance obviously know little about the peer and socially expected British stiff upper lip of the period.  The British produced the kind of man who could lose a leg to cannon fire and remark, ""I seem to have lost my leg,"" instead of screaming.

A person cannot say that the lions were hunted, simply the lions hunted and while hunting man they were shot and killed at different times.  The cast was superb, scenery superb, and the production was breathtaking.  Surprise with Michael Douglas, as he was barely recognizable and gave a stellar performance.  Val Kilmer was great in being able to project true fear.  A bit brutal and graphic, but necessary to the plot.",1454198400,8,576,4.826530612244898

If we had even seen Michael Douglas's name on the credits we probably would have been worried about the R rating, but going in we just hoped it might be for man-eating lion gore.  We were right not to worry.  This is NOT an ""R"" movie as most anticipate.  There is no particular immorality or sex or language (that I remember) to worry about.  We would have let our kids watch this growing up.  It is a GOOD action-adventure with strong, well-portrayed characters and wonderful photography and production values.  The history of this incident is well-documented and this movie is reputed to be an accurate portrayal.  The characters are dynamic and the story very much draws you in.  Suspenseful.

A great date-night suspense with tons of action without being over the top with blood and gore. The scenery of the railroad being built in Tsavo (Africa) was impressive.  Not long. Probably not for young children. A little graphic with the lion attacks...little or no profanity

850439,5,6304353634,"Val Kilmer is an Irish Soldier & engineer working for the British Empire as they attempt to build a bridge & railroad in mystical tribal Kenya (I think if I recall right?) in a brilliantly made ""African Safari version of Jaws-or Jurassic Park"" action adventure historical piece.

 Michael Douglas plays a really cool character who is this lost American white mercenary who travels to Africa and specializes in both the native black African culture, and the wild animals of the dark continent.  Douglas works and is friendly with the Massai People who have been boldly both restoring the natural balance of the animals, and also hunting the occasional ferocious lions.  Kilmer needs to find and kill these two super natural man eating super lions, and recruits Douglas and his friends among the tribe to help him.  These two lions are much more then they had bargained for, stalking and hunting the men of the camp down one by one until very few are left.  Based on a real story in British Imperial history, ""Ghost in the Darkness"" is nothing short of awesome.

 The late Siskel and Ebert gave the movie thumbs down, one main reason is Douglas's character seemed to be portrayed more as a guy from the 20th century and not the 19th, but in any event I think this movie still works very well and stands up above most other films.

 A+ and two thumbs up, a great adventure thriller.",1430006400,,1379,4.661157024793388

What makes this film stand out from most is how they were able to take a historic event and weave just about every human emotion into it without seeming overly melodramatic.  They put in just enough ""blood and guts"" to show you just how vicious this pair of lions were.  The timing of the background music was almost perfect.  Michael Douglas had the perfect personality for his role, and played it very well.  All the supporting actors really fit well into their respective roles, and all did a good job.  It is rare to find a movie where everything seems to come together.

Michael Douglas is one my favorite actors.  I think he was a poor choice for his role in this movie. It was like taking his Romancing the Stone character (Jack Colton) and injecting it into this period piece.  During the movie, I just saw Jack Colton not Charles Remington.

Michael Douglas is just inappropriately placed as an actor for this role, and tends to not be likable even though I feel as if I was supposed to attach to him.

Val Kimer doesn't really bring the acting repertoire a few notches higher except in some, admitted good, scenes.

Either way, the move overlooks really disturbing practices such as slavery, forceful western conquering, and debilitating diseases let alone the slaughter of animals (even though highly fictitious, still gunned down for protecting territory).

Ok, enough politics - the movie does not live up to it's prior reviews.",1415750400,,775,5.03125

Kilmer passes as a plausible Patterson, while Douglas hams it up as American hunting legend and rifle builder Remington. Good supporting roles make the movie enjoyable as Patterson struggles to dispense with a band of lions who are eating his laborers while he must design and build a railway bridge at Tsavo, now the Kenya-Uganda railway. Of course, Hollywood embellished the story with irrelevant and needless side plots, but the strength of the story itself saves the day.",1415059200,,582,4.938775510204081

Some of the screenplay is clearly fabricated to make it a ""movie"".  The Michael Douglas character, for example, was no doubt written into the screenplay at the request of Executive Producer...you guess it, Michael Douglas, since no such character exists in the real story.  That unnecessary character, Remington (no, not that Remington) seems like the retired version of Jack T. Colton, from the Romancing the Stone movies.  The actual story is interesting enough.  Two previous movie versions of the book are no better, one of which, Bwana Devil, was made during the first 3D craze.

The story is highly symbolic, but this is counter pointed by Michael Douglas' performance as an American big game hunter sent to help the British in their immediate quest to complete construction of a railway bridge. The pair of lions have hindered this by their bloodthirsty hunger to kill as many workers as they can keeping them from completing construction of the trestle.

851801,5,6304353634,"A thrilling drama based on the true story of  two extraordinary lions known as The Ghost and the Darkness who terrorized the city of Tsavo in Africa. No horror story can match this reality. Val Kilmer is perfect as the idealistic young Scottish engineer charged with building a bridge in this besieged town.  Michael Douglas is brilliant as the gruff, disillusioned expatriate American who, having lost all in the Civil War, has chosen Africa to be his new home. He and the young engineer join forces in their attempt to sort out Tsavo's problem.",1412985600,,546,4.797872340425532

To some extent it succeeds and is worth the watch. The viewer should challenge self to figure out what is happening inside our intrepid bridge-builder as he traverses the challenges of bringing'modern'engineering marvels to the subcontinent of Africa.

There was a conflict/rivalry between the two main actors, but I didn't really see that it came from anything.  Their conflict didn't come from anything that resonated in me.  Indeed, Kilmer's motivation was a mystery:  did he want to finish the bridge, did he want to prove his boss wrong, did he want to make peace between the two groups of workers or did he want to kill the lions?  As far as Douglas goes, I have never known a real hunter who did not feel some kinship with his or her prey.  How else can you outsmart them?  In this movie, I didn't ever know what made Douglas a good hunter, except that he'd killed a lot of animals.  Finally, the nature of hunting is always questionable, and in colonial situations it's even more so.  Should they be killing lions at all?  Perhaps the lions were a way of saying that white people should not be there, building a railroad, in a land that they could understand only by conquering.  I am not necessarily saying that's true, but the fact that I had the question took away from any passion I felt in the movie itself.  Alas, there's a great story here, but this isn't it.",1411344000,,1276,4.3559322033898304

The true account has small variations, such as Michael Douglass' character being entirely fictitious, but the true account is just as unsettling as the fictional one. Tsavo had/has a long bad history of man-eating lions going back to death tolls on the slave routes. The den of bones is real, and had so many bones within it it was predicted that many lions had utilized the den over years or even decades. Were the Ghost and the Darkness part of some sort of subset of tsavo lion that delighted in slaughtering men, or were they only young males with damaged teeth who took to human meat out of desperation?

852427,3,6304353634,"I seem to remember this theme of vengeful lions in another European film years ago. What makes this version fair is the use of the camera to catch the wind-ruffled tall grasses which may - or may not - be the lions moving through it, and the brief but exemplary performance by the former star of SHAKA ZULU. Although Michael Douglas gets top billing, it is pretty much the other principals who hold it together.",1411084800,,411,4.493333333333333

852630,5,6304353634,"I'm a guy, and this is a 'real-guy's' kind-of a film. A story about real men that actually happened...
Just over 120 years ago now, the British were building railroads in Africa. When they came to the Tsavo river, they found three
obstacles; one was the river, the other two were both Lions. Both man-eaters had become a team, a doppelganger that terrified
every rational man on the construction site of this otherwise ordinary railroad bridge. There was nothing ordinary about the Lions.
We have historical evidence that they killed more than 40 men, and some have said as many as 100 ~in a part of Africa where
there was plenty of wild game for them to hunt and kill. Kilmer is John Patterson, an Irish civil-engineer whose job is the bridge.
Douglas is Charles Remington, the real game hunter from post civil-war America. The story is simple-enough; two, fierce Lions+
two, thoroughly frightened men = true story. Along with the best from Ireland and America (and India), there is also Africa's famous
Masai tribal hunters. THEIR name for the Lions is ""Ghost and the Darkness"", and they ultimately decide that there is no glory in
following these demons, only death (so they depart). These Lions do not go quietly, and not everyone gets out alive. If you live close to say, a zoo or a wild animal park, you may want to think twice before clicking on the 'watch' button with your hand-held
TV remote control. -especially if you must get up early the next morning. Sleeping after THIS may be difficult. A fearless African
named Samuel reminds us ultimately that we can still be frightened by these very same, two Lions. ""...Even Now...""",1410652800,4,1637,4.747368421052632

I was looking forward to an epic builders tale of engineering conquering insurmountable challenges and instead got Val Kilmer in what has to be his most wooden role ever (and I've been a fan of his every since growing up on Willow) and a bridge over a tepid stream.  Every line is delivered in the very definition of a deadpan.  And the lion attack scenes I did see were so comical I think that they were going for a satirical parody here.  I couldn't bring myself to finish watching it, but I'd love to have some of whatever all of the people giving this movie 5 stars are smoking.  I can only imagine that the people who like this movie are the same that flock to horror movies for a cheap thrill whether it comes with a good plot and actual acting or not.

It is rather fascinating that this is based on a true story and that there is an actual place that for some strange reason turns lions in the area into man-eaters.  I'd rather watch a documentary on that than this.",1410048000,2,1123,4.219626168224299

as workers become more and more afraid and threaten to quit, val's character has to keep project going while trying one method after another to kill the lions.

853414,3,6304353634,"I remember really liking this movie when it first came out, perhaps because I have always wished I had become a field biologist studying large cats.  However, after not having seen it in well more than a decade, I was disappointed by what I remembered.

Of course everything was bastardized by Hollywood, even the lions (two novel males whose stuffed bodies are on display at the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History) were misrepresented in both appearance and behavior.  While they did kill quite a few people in real life, the lions in the movie behaved nothing like real lions.  And the people?  They also don't behave very much like real people; there's no way someone gets dragged out of their tent by the leg in the middle of the night without making a sound.  And three hunters armed with rifles who are completely incapable of hitting a trapped lion just a few feet away because they are terrified?  Whatever.  I also found some of the characters to be too stereotypical, making it difficult to get into the story.

However, despite it's many drawbacks, I still enjoy the movie, or rather, the idea behind the movie.  I just wish it hadn't been dumbed down so much by Hollywood in order to appeal to the wider American audience.  Every now and again, it would be nice to have a movie for those of us whose brains demand a little more than tired out formulas, and sensationalized BS.  A movie can be good without completely suspending physical and natural realities.",1391817600,,1476,4.678294573643411

853547,5,6304353634,"I think this is a great horror movie, especially for one made quite a while ago. Most of the events that happen for the most part are true, and the real lion skins and skulls really are on display in Chicago. Some elements were added, like the lions had manes when they shouldn't have and the American hunter never existed, but that was all for movie purposes and I can understand that.
The movie stuck with Patterson's claims that the lions killed over a hundred people while a study done about 10 years ago show that the first lion killed ate only about 10 people while the second ate about 24 but that never accounted into the people they killed and didn't ate.
Also, I really enjoy the 1 star reviews the say this movie promotes animal cruelty and that this was a terrible idea and storyline someone came up with. It's a true story stupids. :)",1390348800,,847,4.401273885350318

With this said, I realize this movie is a bit unrealistic but it is based on actual events. We must keep in mind that Hollywood has to embellish things a bit but as long as we view the film with that in mind you shouldn't have any trouble enjoying this movie. As an example, I recently saw Lone Survivor, the story about the Seal Team that was killed in Afghanistan. Having read the book when it first came out some time ago, I could tell where the screenwriters took license with some of the facts but because I know that this practice is quite prevelant in the movie industry, I had no trouble enjoying the film.

853743,2,6304353634,"Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  This review is for the new 2013 DVD.  Others have already detailed the acting, plot, etc., so I won't bother.  Does this version have superior A/V quality compared with the previous release?  Unfortunately, the answer is ""no.""  It's the same disc, just with different packaging.  And it has all the same flaws: telecine wobble, overabundance of grain, and poor contrast; it could also use some color correction.  But the worst offense is the aspect ratio; the studio slapped a widescreen transfer into a 4x3 format.  This means that the image you see on a 16x9 TV is only about half of what should be there.  This can be solved by using the zoom function available on most TV sets, but this will a) distort the picture, b) magnify the film's inherent flaws, or c) do both.  In 2013, with 16x9 TVs as the standard, this was just inexcusable.  Shame on them for this substandard DVD.  On its own merits, without consideration of technical problems, I would rate this film at four stars.  But it's difficult to enjoy a movie when the presentation is so poor.  I'm just glad there weren't any problems with the sound as well.  I bought this DVD because I saw ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" in theater years ago, and liked it.  But I can't recommend buying this edition (or the previous one).  My only consolation is that it's cheap, so I'm not out very much money.  In case you're interested, the only ""special feature"" is a theatrical trailer.

For those who want more info about the events depicted in the film, there are two books (that I know of) available on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Eaters-of-Tsavo-Peter-Capstick-Library-Series/dp/0312510101/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man-Eaters of Tsavo (Peter Capstick Library Series)</a>(in a number of editions), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lions-of-Tsavo-Exploring-the-Legacy-of-Africa-s-Notorious-Man-Eaters/dp/0071363335/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lions of Tsavo : Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters</a>.  To my knowledge, the latter book is considered the definitive history of this incident.  The story of the Tsavo lions was also the subject of at least one ""Wild Discovery"" and ""History's Lost and Found"" episode.  There was a 50 minute documentary made around the time of the film's release, but I've never watched it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maneaters-of-Tsavo-VHS/dp/6304391560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maneaters of Tsavo [VHS</a>].",1384300800,6,2640,5.965425531914893
853744,4,6304353634,"I've always been fascinated and horrified by the story of Tsavo and decided to check it out.  As many people have said, the scenery and music were great, and the sound (esp the lions) terrifyingly good.

The portrayal of what happened was a BIT silly, I admit (like Jaws or Jurassic Park, with lions...beast as relentless hunter of humans for no apparent reason) but if that's what really happened, then so be it.  Still, the lions with blood around their mouths half the time...come on, it was like watching Silence of the Lambs in lion form. I'm sure lions clean up.  They're cats! Cats are tidy.

Also, Val Kilmer's accent came and went (annoying) and NOBODY's teeth were that white back then.  I thought Michael Douglas's brief appearance was good.  Not Oscar winning, but good! He IS, after all, an Oscar winner in the past. Like another reviewer said, ""Michael Dounglas is...Michael Douglas).

I thought Val Kilmer was well cast (and for the ladies, became more rugged and attractive looking as the movie went on). I mean, HE was no Oscar winner but why the Razzie? He wasn't that bad!

There was suspense, and things that were just as horrifying as in any...horror movie. Again, beast as ""serial killer"" was a little silly but like I said, apparently that is pretty much what happened.

The film was not too long, and was easy to understand.  If some creative license was taken, fine.  It's Hollywood.  No big deal.

The lions were SO beautiful in the film...though I assume they were computer generated. If so, good job! They did not LOOK that way, like the tigers in Gladiator did!

The acting is very good with Val Kilmer putting in a good performance confident engineer put in charge of the project whose dream has been to go to Africa.  Michael Douglas appears in a character role and does very well as a rugged, experienced hunter hired by the railroad to kill the lions.  The multiple lion attacks were well done, well cut, and gave the lions a mystical, unstoppable force.  I felt the ending was too shmaltzy for my taste.",1380672000,,721,4.774193548387097

Val Kilmer is at his best in this film.  Great Family entertainment, I wouldnt be afraid to let my children watch this with me.  Fiercely entertaining!",1380240000,,291,4.76
854017,3,6304353634,"The plot is basic and gets to the point fast enough. Col. John Henry Patterson goes to Africa to finish a job on railroad construction in a small village. They have a little lion situation on their hands, and Patterson tries to hold on to the workers but eventually most of them leave despite his best efforts. (Imagine that! I think I'd rather lose a little pay over being lion chow any day!)  Enter obvious hero type Charles Remington (Douglas), lion killer extraordinaire. You can almost imagine music playing in the background whenever he has a scene. Now there are three men left to battle the two beasts. Who will prove to be the true kings of the jungle when all is said and done?

Based on the true story of two lions that actually began hunting and eating humans in Africa, Ghost and the Darkness paints a realistic enough picture while staying entertaining at the same time. These lions are barbarous creatures, no real selectiveness in their slaughter. For this kind of picture, the death count is relatively high, and although much of the graphic violence is only hinted upon, a lot is still shown in all its juicy glory.

I have always held a special place in my heart for Michael Douglas. He's a fantastic actor, and his character was the more interesting of the group. (Not that that's saying a whole lot). Val Kilmer showed off his good looks and acting skills again. All did their job well enough, even the ones only there for brief glimpses before becoming lion fodder. For directing, there are some slick lion POV shots, as well as shots of the victims being dragged.

The film employs great usage of sound, particularly the lions breathing, peoples fear, growling, and the natural music of the night. The script held a hint here and there about something supernatural in the air...a nice possibility, but to me that took a little away from the power of just having these being two pissed off kitties.

Ghost and the Darkness is an interesting tale that exploits the potential cruelty of one of nature's greatest predators, and does a decent job of inserting drama from the human players at the same time. My only gripe would be that things could have been spruced up a bit between the action sequences. Sometimes things just grew a little tedious, even dull at some points.

I cared about the people well enough but didn't really warm up to many besides Douglas' character. Even Kilmer, doing the great job he did, couldn't fully fire up the man he played. The pacing and drama were a little off and may I say slightly *gasp* boring. But overall, it's worth a watch. It's a good nature suspense picture that has some violent scenarios and takes itself seriously. Add into the more than competent actors, creepy furry villains, and you have something worth watching, and maybe buying, although only for a fairy cheap amount.",1379635200,,2843,4.687374749498998

Directing, acting and music score were well thought out.  Kilmer and Douglas are fantastic but enough has been said about all that.

But, the lion attacks don't stop, and Patterson can't stop them himself. The Ghost and The Darkness is a beautifully-shot, adventurous, and suspenseful film.

The story in this film is amazing. It really captures its setting through its action and dialogue, and, more so through its beautiful cinematography and music. It's very atmospheric and immersive, as well. The lion hunting - whether they fail or succeed - really captures adventure and suspense, and even terror. It all leads up to an amazing ending. Val Kilmer delivers an amazing performance, as does Michael Douglas. As previously mentioned, the film looks amazing, and the music really matches the film's setting and tone.

Overall, The Ghost and The Darkness is an amazing adventure/suspense film; its performances, action, suspense cinematography, and music are superb. As of 5/25/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, although a purchase is highly recommended.

The Ghost and The Darkness has strong violence and gore.",1369440000,,1148,5.194594594594594
854269,5,6304353634,"While certain liberties were taken with the storyline there was enough left to give us a gist of the reality, and even then, it would have been hard to believe. The gist is,Col. John Patterson was sent to Africa in 1898 to build a bridge in a place called Tsavo. While he was there, he was suddenly confronted by the problems of the railroad but discovered a real threat from the local wildlife. While he keeps trying to convince himself that they are ""just lions"" these lions show an uncanny wit and capacity to outwit Patterson's every effort to trap and kill them as the two lions literally decimate his workforce with frightening efficiency, even striking in daylight to pick off prey. The truth is, these lions have actually killed at least 130 people between them, most from his workforce. Remington appears after being summoned by Beaumont and assists with the first lion. While this part is fiction it doesn't distract from the storyline at all, but adds to the pathos when he becomes a victim of the surviving lion. By this time John is at wits end, but manages to sort everything out at the last. The lions were real. They do exist in the Field Museum in Chicago. They have a true history of blood behind them, and while some of the tale was exaggerated it did not detract at all from the truth. Tsavo was indeed well named as a place of slaughter as it was once a native battleground and then two man-eaters hunting grounds. The real lions of Tsavo didn't have any manes, because the area is mostly thorn brush, but after seeing a maniacal lion coming at you in the dark, a mane-or lack of one would be the last thing anyone would notice. If anyone deserves an oscar for performance, it should go to the lions. They were the most frightening things I had ever seen.",1369440000,,1776,4.501547987616099

Those who love Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas (no matter what the plot and no matter how empty their characters) will react as I did.  I love this movie!

854511,4,6304353634,"I knew the basics of the true story going in and I think this movie was a decent enough portrayal of the actual events to be chilling. Not sure why it's rated R, though; I've seen gorier scenes on CSI and in Jaws. But that's not a bad thing. There's enough blood to be underscore the terror and the deadly nature of the attacks but it doesn't go overboard. Definitely not a movie for kids or the squeamish though.

The only thing I didn't care for was the addition of the American hunter character, Remington, who is played by Douglas. This character is completely fictional and unnecessary to the story. I didn't mind Douglas himself as an actor though.  He did well enough with what he was given. But the true story is that Patterson killed both lions on his own, without help from an American. Kilmer played the role well.

I think the nightly lion attacks could have been focused on more to build up the suspense for the hunting of the lions at the end. But other than that I would say it was a good movie.",1364083200,,1010,4.333333333333333

854679,5,6304353634,"One of my favourite films. A bridge being built in Africa at the end of the 19th century forms the backdrop of an astonishing adventure, based on real events. An Irish engineer (Val Kilmer) gets hired to build the bridge by an arrogant businessman (Tom Wilkinson). His work is interrupted by the presence of two lions attacking his workers. Kilmer is ideally cast as the engineer Colonel Patterson, a good husband and impending father who is able to work with people completely outside his culture, and who finds himself in a desperate situation as the killings continue. Michael Douglas plays an exceptional character role as a fictitious hunter brought in to help, a man who doesn't like to hunt but does it because it's what he's good at. John Kani plays Samuel, the crew foreman, right hand man, and friend to Patterson, a warm and wise local man who holds his own fear of lions. Brian McCardie appears as the overly cheerful and evangelical assistant Starling, an exuberant and somewhat out of his place white man at the site. This film was the first time I saw Bernard Hill and Tom Wilkinson in anything, and they've gone on to be personal favourite actors. Hill is the jaded, cynical camp doctor, disgusted by the true purpose of the railroad: to solidify control of Africa. Wilkinson as Beaumont is an arrogant, thoughtless brute only concerned with his own place in history, having little regard for the people working for him, and it's a terrific, though short role. Stunning landscapes abound throughout the film, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith completes the picture. Frightening at times, this film really, really gets under your skin, makes you feel like you're there in Africa, and ensures that you'll never quite look at tall savannah grasses the same way again.",1359504000,,1779,4.855263157894737

854952,4,6304353634,"I have to say, I did enjoy this film very much. As another reviewer stated, I don't think the whole truth was conveyed here. I've read many conflicting reports as to what was the cause of this bloody carnage. Some say it was the fact that the lions food source was hunted and ate by the railway workers.
Whatever the reason, the events really did take place. These lions killed many people brutally. They did work as a team, something that is normal to lions in this area of Africa. In other areas the females do the hunting.
I think what the film does do well, is convey the terror that was felt by every worker building that railroad. Yes sadly Hollywood has always stretched the truth a bit. I don't know why they cant ever just stick to the story, reality is always better than fiction.
Well putting all that aside, the film hits the mark in every way. When I saw it, I didn't think about how or whether it stuck to the story, I just watched it for the entertainment value. This movie is definitely worth a watch. P.S. As narrated at the end of the movie, these lions are on display at a museum in Chicago. The museums name is the Field Museum. Check out the website, they even show the lions! I might add, I've also seen the movie male lion, the one that was in the actual film! I say 'Lion' because the other one died. I saw it at a zoo in Southern Ontario, Canada. It was truly magnificent, sad to see such a majestic creature in such a small confined space.

The movie is frightening, and at times bloody, yet I feel that the movie honestly portrays the events as they occurred, and pulls no punches,so it is realistically portrayed as it really happened.

There are true heroes in this film that faced death in their efforts to stop the killings,and shows man's humanity in caring for others and being willing to sacrifice themselves to stop these unprecedented animal's killing spree.

855029,5,6304353634,"I have always liked ""The Ghost and the Darkness"", ever since I first saw it in the theater. For me, it harkens back to the old black & white ""African Safari"" films of the 30's and 40's, but with better acting, story and realism.

I love wildlife, so I could never watch a movie where wild animals are killed by hunters just out for something to take back home and stuff! This story isn't about that, its about human survival against two predators who were known to have killed 135 human rail-workers just for the pleasure (we know that Lions will kill baboons just because they hate baboons, so to me, this is believable) of it in 1898.

I think Val Kilmer is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He does a great job portraying a real life Victorian era Irish engineer, John Henry Patterson, believable brogue and all, and creates a character you like and can relate to. Even Michael Douglas' self-indulgent creation of the fictional character ""Charles Remington"", whom Douglas created for himself (Douglas was also Executive Producer on the film) is a great addition to the story and is well portrayed by Douglas. The friendship that develops between Patterson (Kilmer) and Remington (Douglas) is believable and when Remington becomes the lions next victim, he is truly missed. The supporting cast is wonderful, even if many of them don't survive to the films climactic end.

One of the standout elements of The Ghost and the Darkness was the score composed for it by, the now late, Jerry Goldsmith. Jerry Goldsmith always had a penchant for scoring for African/Desert themed films and this score is no exception. It is powerful, moving, frightening and lends the exact right flavor to the film and compliments its visuals perfectly. I usually don't get too weepy when watching films, but when Goldsmith plays his sweet, sweeping ""resolution"" theme when Patterson sees his wife at the Tsavo train station and meets his newborn son for the first time at the conclusion of the film, I can't help but get choked up by the scene! The scene of Patterson's burning of the fields after Remington is killed is powerfully accentuated by Goldsmith's music!

As mentioned in the film, the two actual male Lions who were the man-eaters in the real event are on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. I have visited the museum and saw the two lions myself. Although the lions are maneless, which is a trait of Tsavo lions (they were portrayed in the film as HAVING manes), they are HUGE and one can see the power and ferocity that was there once.

The film itself is HIGHLY underrated and tends to get maligned, mostly by people who admit that they never actually sat down and watched the film from beginning to end. I think this low opinion of the film is completely unjustified, because, even IF you don't like the film's subject matter, this incident REALLY occurred, the acting is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, the locations are great, the music is magnificent and the story is gripping and moving.

Technically, the DVD is not the best quality transfer that it could have been and I hope they re-release it on DVD and Blu-Ray someday soon with a higher resolution transfer. The Ghost and the Darkness DESERVES to be seen in its best form!
I give ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" 5 stars without hesitation.",1347321600,3,3326,4.7456747404844295

Actually, I love this movie but be warned: it is extremely violent and gory- but for some reason, I always forget those parts when I recommend this movie to others, even though I personally hate graphic violence.

855036,5,6304353634,"This movie is one of my favorite action/adventure films because like JAWS, it is not a mythical or manmade monster.  The lions are the predators/the monsters terrorizing a British-funded railway crew.  The Ghost and the Darkness is about the two maneating lions that terrorized the crew building a bridge at a desolate and isolated place called Tsavo, Africa, circa 1890s, a place that had long been known as an area of active man-eating lions. The movie is based on the story of  Col. John H. Patterson, the engineer responsible for building the bridge and killing the lions. Col Patterson is brilliantly played  by Val Kilmer who shows an concrete resolve and fervor to work it out in his head. He is determined to solve the problem of 'the Maneaters of Tsavo.'  There is literary license and plenty of Hollywood-esque touches here but the story of two rampaging lions holds the thrills throughout the film.  Famed American hunter, John Remington played with much wit by Michael Douglas gives a good performance. Remington's character brings the American bravado and simple wisdom that balances the fervor and wit of Patterson.  What is evident here is that this film holds nothing back and the humans are fallible.  The lions are photographed in a way that they are like ghosts that wisp in and out of the scene and leave death in their wake. The use of the lion's PVO also adds to the power and control that they have.

Incidentally, the maneless male lions are on display at the Museuem of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois - fact stated at the end of the film., The word 'Tsavo' does mean a place of evil. Finally, there have been recent reports of new man-eating lions roaming the plains of Tsavo.",1345680000,,1707,4.759322033898305
855037,5,6304353634,"Africa is under construction with a massive railroad line in Kenya.  John Henry Patterson (Val Kilmer) is a very good engineer and he is hired to work on the project and get it done as it is getting bogged down and way behind schedule.  Upon his arrival at the construction site he finds that the workers are terrified of the lions that have been attacking the work crew.  Patterson shoots and kills a lion and the workers all respect him as the man who has saved them.  Little do they know that their problems have just begun.

Day after day men are killed and they soon discover that there are two more man-eaters that are ravaging the workers at will and they don't seem to be able to stop them.  The workers blame Patterson for not getting rid of the lions and he is even injured while trying to kill them.  The terrified workers name the lions The Ghost and The Darkness as they move like spirits and seem unstoppable.  The railroad sends in famous hunter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas) to help kill the lions and the action is non-stop....

This movie is outstanding and the action just continues to escalate throughout the entire film.  The lions kill over 100 men (in the movie) and the movie can get gruesome at times.  The man-eaters work in tandem and are brave and vicious killers.  They are killing as much for sport as they are for eating.  This is based on a true story and the lions are actually on display in the Field Museum in Chicago.  It is a very scary movie and while we all like a good scary monster movie once in a while this film makes you believe that there can be real life animals that are just as terrifying.

855038,5,6304353634,"LOVED IT!  Very suspenseful!

Set in the late 1800's, Val Kilmer plays a military engineer who loves building bridges and has passionately desired to go to Africa his whole life.  He gets his chance when a British bridge project in Africa is going poorly and he is sent to take over and get it done on a very tight schedule.

Unfortunately, there are some male lions in the area working together (they never share territory much less work together) and killing for pleasure (not food) and Kilmer is losing workers left and right to these vicious man-eaters.

Construction is at a standstill, the workers want to leave the area, but (after 30 deaths) the British agree to hire a renowned hunter who should resolve the lion problem in a few days so they stay and give Douglas and his group of native hunters the benefit of the doubt.  After the first hunt together, the African hunters decide the lions are ghost-demons and they leave.

The man-eating lion duo continue to outsmart Kilmer and Douglas and keep boldly taking more lives. Finally after a particularly deadly attack (mass victims) the remaining workers leave and it's just Kilmer, Douglas and a friend against the deadly lions.

NOTE: there is a bit of a gore factor to this movie because they show bodies of some of those attacked, and because Kilmer and Douglas use blood (fakey looking) and large animal chunks as bait.  I think the majority of us can handle it, but easily squeamish folks may not want to see this.

855169,5,6304353634,"March-December 1898 Tsavo, Kenya: during the building of the Uganda-Mombasa Railway, two man-eater lions terrorized the construction camp.  According to Colonel John Henry Patterson these two lions killed 135 men from March to December.  These lions were eventually killed on December 9 and 29th.  In 1907 he published his account in The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.

The Ghost and the Darkness, the names for these two fearless lions, is a 1996 film starring Michael Douglas as the great white hunter Charles Remington and Val Kilmer as Colonel John Henry Patterson whose mission was to build the bridge at all costs.  When you toss in great African scenery and Jerry Goldsmith's music you have a great adventure film loosely based on The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.

The lions are presented as predators that are meticulous and deadly as they hunt their prey among the terrified construction workers.  The scenes where they attack are gruesome. These lions are not afraid of anything.

As the construction camp is abandoned by the international array of workers, Remington and Patterson track the lions and discover their lair in a cave.  What they find in the cave is like stumbling upon a trophy case of a serial killer.

For the first time you see fear etched in Remington's face.  His words are profound, ""Lions don't do this. Lions never had a lair like this.  They're doing it for the pleasure.""  Patterson calmly replied, ""They'll know we've been here.""

What follows is a strategy of the great hunter and the seasoned military officer.  Unfortunately, there are tragic consequences.

The fight scene between Patterson and the last lion keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It is well executed.

There has been criticism of Val Kilmer's acting in this fine film.  Patterson is a complex character who evolves over the course of the film.  Kilmer played the role well.

This is an exceptional film.  I fail to see why it has been overlooked by the general public.

Patterson's book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo is available from Amazon as well.  The lions are on display in the Field Museum in Chicago.",1327968000,6,2090,4.888888888888889

The Ghost and the Darkness

If I had read Roger Ebert's scathing review first, I probably wouldn't have bought this movie.  Another reviewer wrote that the first ten minutes of the film are so dark (visually) that it's impossible to tell who is who.  The acting is sub-par; Val Kilmer won a ""Razzie"" for worst supporting actor and Michael Douglas just doesn't work as the Great White Hunter. He is dressed in a ridiculous Crocodile Dundee outfit and looks terribly out of place - like a guy in a Tuxedo accidently walking into a dive bar.
The only saving grace are the performances of John Kani as the trusted, knowing native Samuel and Om Puri as Abdullah.
The movie did win an Oscar - for sound editing (presumably the roaring of the two lions)
The cinematography is excellent...although not on a par with ""Zulu"" or ""Mountains of the Moon,"" both of which are far superior movies.  I give ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" three stars for effort and not much else.",1316563200,,1129,5.290502793296089

Loved the film as it was excellent combination of correct setting for time period, building of the railroad, loved the actors as they had to actually ""act"" their parts.  Believeable scenes, with acting, not necessary to show all the blood & gore.
Though I was afraid the movie would be too bloody, gory, extreme suspense, etc., my 80+ yrs Mom loved it.  She said she loved the actors in these roles than in the other movies they've acted in.
My Mom wanted full story about the lions.  I told her what I learned from special program on TV & the internet.

However, can anyone help me?  I did see the original movie about the true story, subject matter about the building of the railroad, the lions who attacked workers, etc., was made into a film BEFORE the 1990's version.  The previous, first movie was also in color, storyline changed, though an excellent scarey film as well.  I have been searching for this first film version but the title eludes me.

It is about an ethnographic present during the turn of the 20th Century when England was installing the Railroad in Africa/India.  Two male lions are the subjects who, aberrantly inclined, as they were killing not out of hunger or attacking because of any incursion into their domain by hunters or land encroachment by settlers.  They were killing for the ""fun"" of it.  Highly interesting Movie.

No one could capture and or kill these lions not even the best Lion Hunters of that Century.  Amazing is an understatement.

The Movie is very adventurous and thrilling and because it is based on true events, more so.

It is Val Kilmer, the railroad designer, who notices the cave drawing therein. Namely, that of a lion. Shortly thereafter, the viewer sees what could be interpreted as an altar piece. In one place shown, there lies a human skull framed by what might be meant as human bones. This ties in with the indigenous belief of the souls of shamans living again within the lions of Tsavo, on this round. Long ago, huge cave lions existed in the world. Human history is bound up with nature and the animal world. A movie like this keeps that connection alive, no matter how far many have strayed by drawing primarily from the cognitive part of the brain.

855477,4,6304353634,"Two male lions kill lots of people. Sounds cool, and it bloody well is. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a thrilling experience to sit through. It's far from being a perfect film, and yet it's a film that's somehow impossible to hate, or even dislike. There's lots of animal attack galore to be found here, yet it never quite overrides the overall visual appeal of it all.

In 1898, Irish Colonel John Patterson is sent to the river Tsavo, Africa, to construct a railroad bridge - forcing him to leave his pregnant wife behind in London. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns of a rampant lion on the loose. He quickly manages to kill it, raising the morale of the workers. This, however, proves to be entirely deceptive. Soon after, two male lions start to prey on the workers - chillingly, they appear to kill for sport rather than food. All efforts to stop them are in vain until hunter Charles Remington arrives to help Patterson rid Tsavo, and the workers, of this threat. But the lions (called the Ghost and the Darkness by the workers) are smart, and disposing of them won't be easy even with Remington in league.

This premise is based on a real-life account by John Patterson, and it was practically destined for a movie adaptation. While it is quite true that the movie differentiates on Patterson's account in many ways (Remington is entirely fictional), it's all for the benefit of this film. The actual lions were maneless, yet for the sake of the movie's aesthetics, the fully-maned lions (Bongo and Caesar) strike a more impressive image. The easiness with which the lions kill is also a tad exaggerated, but then, again, the film is all the more suspenseful for it. A big plus is that the cinematography of this movie is fantastic. One of the scenes in particular - where we first truly see one of the lions kill and eat a worker before our very eyes - is fabulously staged and filmed. In fact, it's one of those movie moments that have edged themselves permanently into my memory - the most artistic, even beautiful piece of animal gore filmmaking you could find (nothing too queasy). The movie deservedly won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing (the lions's growls, roars and chomps send shivers down my spine for one), and the African-flavoured score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful.

While it may not be as memorable as the aforementioned, the acting is more than acceptable. John Patterson may be Val Kilmer's most underrated and misunderstood performance; he delivers the role with an understatement that fits the brooding nature of the character. His very subtle Irish accent, possibly heavily affected by a long servitude of Britain, is another trait he gets across very well. Remington is endlessly entertaining and the two characters work together like magic. John Kani and Brian McCardie are both solid as faithful co-leader Samuel and missionary Angus Starling. Emily Mortimer's Helena Patterson cannot be overlooked, either; her few scenes are enough to demonstrate the strong relationship between her husband and her.

If there is one thing I can criticise, it's the editing. There are moments when the staging reveals itself to be flawed, in particular the hospital attack scene. The cutting disrupts the continuity and flow of the scene rather than supports it - sometimes you can even plainly see that those are animatronic lions. Mostly, however, it's real lions in all their glory.

This movie isn't for everyone. Despite the savageness, the lions and their attacks are almost sophisticated to behold, and it's perhaps this that's the most thrilling aspect of the film. There are no special features to be found on this DVD, but then this movie is interesting enough as it is (though I do wish they would have at least included the cut scene where Patterson gets up close to one of the lions - a scene which Michael Douglas admits was one of the best scenes). Besides, not every piece of filmmaking has to be Lawrence of Arabia, so to speak. Some movies are at their best just being 'cool', as well as believable. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a 'cool' film - and there's nothing wrong with that. This is the best enactment of lion attacks you could find in a movie, and I myself have never seen more aesthetic filmwork on lions. Could be more concrete, but definitely worth a view, for beauty as well as excitement.",1224979200,,4384,4.770750988142293
855478,3,6304353634,"The Ghost and the Darkness
Upon going to a friend's house, we decided to watch a movie. He had a large selection of movies both him and I had never heard of. We just picked out one with an interesting case and slid it in. The Ghost and the Darkness is what we got. Surprisingly, this movie is a much better experience than one would think. The story is a little farfetched, but not enough so you feel alienated from the story.

John Patterson is sent to Africa to build a bridge. This story takes place in the late 1800s when many European countries were attempting to control Africa. Patterson is sent to build a bridge that would complete a railroad. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns that a lion have attacked a man and killed him. Patterson accepts the responsibility of hunting the lion. Later that night he kills the lion in a single shot. The worker's morale is up do to the thought of safety. Soon another lion threat arrives. Two lions begin attacking the workers. The workers believe they are legendary lions known as The Ghost and The Darkness. Patterson must kill these lions to ensure the workers survive and build the bridge.

The story may sound a bit ridiculous, but you learn to love it. The scenery used in this movie is fantastic. My complaint is that sometimes the lighting is too absent. It is hard to see the characters or lions. This is 1996 though, so lighting does not come as easy. The music in the movie works very well. Suspense is perfectly implemented.

One problem in this movie is the lifeless characters. They try to be characters, not normal human beings. Patterson is flat and boring. The workers are also hurt by trying to be a character instead of a person. Remington, a world-renowned hunter, brings life to this film. Sadly, he only appears near the end of the viewing.

There is some light gore in this movie. You do not see anything, but blood flies all over the place. At one point in the film, there is a giant mass of blood in the middle of the field. This is probably all okay for any mature child. However, if lions attacking people frightens them, this may not be for them.

There are not any extras available on this DVD. This works as a cool movie. Watching the cunning lions is interesting. You just have to accept the story for what it is. I recommend giving this one a rent at least.",1222387200,5,2343,4.464953271028038

855532,5,6304353634,"This review refers to the Region 1 ""Widescreen Collection"" DVD edition of ""The Ghost and the Darkness"". Based on a true story in 1898 British colonial Africa, the film deals with man-eating lions that are attacking & killing workers on a railway construction project through Uganda. The lead engineer assigned to the project (perfectly played by Vil Kilmer) was hired to build a bridge across a river.  Little does he know that he will face the biggest challenge of his life in tracking down, outwitting, and killing these savage beasts. Micahel Douglas joins the action about half-way into the film.

This is a fast-moving, well-crafted, action/drama/horror/thriller type of film--very entertaining and suspenseful. If you like the ""Jurassic Park"" films--you will like this action and suspense (who will be eaten next?). The movie is rated R--but there is absolutely no nudity, no profanity (I think the ""S"" word was used once or twice--but no ""F"" word). The R rating is due to some gore relating to the lion attacks (which look very real, but computer graphics & special effects must have played a large part)--but this is no slasher type movie. The gore shown is minimal--enough to give the viewer a flavor as to how powerful and efficient these lions were in hunting and attacking their prey. This film is much closer to PG-13 than R.

Hopefully there will be a future anniversary or special edition that this film deserves. This a bare bones DVD. It is a shame that there is no historical account given regarding the actual events (it is mentioned that the actual lions are stuffed and on display in a museum in Chicago). While the transfer to DVD gives excellent sound and a good picture (sharp and crisp with excellent color), as viewed on my 46-inch large screen, high-defintion TV, played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player)--the picture format is letterboxed, not anamorphic.

Watch this with the lights off, and let your mind go off to an Africa where animals were still the biggest threat to man. I felt like this was so much scarier than say Jaws that it got into my sleep. This film is scarier for being based on actual events. Of course today, there will be some people on the side of the Lions in the tale, but for my part, just kill them! There is only room for one at the top of the food chain.

But that's just me.

However, if you want to take something different away from this film, it makes a good allegory for running a business. If you create a culture of fear in the workplace (i.e. management becomes the lions to the workers) people will work in such a way as to not get eaten (written up or fired), rather than accomplish the desired goals of a company...

I saw one of the stuffed lions at the Field Museum in Chicago (don't know where the other one was that day) and it truly did send a chill down my spine. If you love action/adventure, or just superb acting period, buy this one for your shelf. My only regret is that it doesn't have the added director commentary or special added features that we are spoiled with when we buy more recent DVD's. Though I could only put five stars, this is a ten star movie!!! Be sure to also pick up a copy of Patterson's book 'The Man Eaters of Tsavo' for more info on the real lions.

Later in life, I wished this book could be made into a movie, and my dream really came true when I purchased  the DVD. This movie is based entirely on the book by English railway bridge  builder, John Patterson.

Ironically, the pair of male lions as depicted in the movie was borrowed  from a zoo farm in Alberta, Canada. These lions were fully mane. But in the book, John Patterson described those two lions as lean and maneless...! As factually,  most  lions in Tsavo of Kenya don't have the beautiful mane unlike their cousins in other parts of Africa. This is unusual, maneless male lions because only females don't spot a mane. The movie will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end - never a dull moment. I consider this as the best thrilling movie ever made in the wilds of Africa, especially at this time when the public is conscious about nature conservation. Too bad that  when the movie was made in early 1900s, surround sound was not a popular feature and therefore not included, otherwise the roars of these two persistent man-eaters in the dead of the African night would be very nighmarish in our den when we watch the movie...! Yes, these two lions did chomp more than a hundred railway workers that at one stage they were compelled to quit until the pair was finally hunted down. John finally skinned the two man-eating lions and sold their skins  and bones to the field museum at  Springfield, Illioness. This pair of  mounted, maneless  notorious man-eating lions are still there for everyone to see and contemplate.

This classic movie depicting  a strange aspect of yesterday-Africa is historically true and thus highly recommended. So go for it while it is still available. Cheers...!",1177632000,29,1864,4.663608562691132

When you see the name of William Goldman on the list of credits of a film, you know for sure that there will be more in the movie than meets the eye.

Now, when I read here reviews that destroy the GHOST AND THE DARKNESS by pointing out that the lions in the film don't act like real lions, I feel sad and sorry for these reviewers. It's like hating a Picasso painting because the faces of its characters are misshappen. The characters or events pictured in a fiction movie have a life of their own that should convey the artistic vision of the director or the screenwriter. If the lions don't act like in a documentary film, it's simply because the authors of the film wanted them to be larger than life.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is one of the best adventure movies I've seen in a long time. Lavishly photographed by the multi-awarded Vilmos Zsigmond, with an effective musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, the film shows the duel that opposes two highly symbolic couples. This duel quickly overshadows the subplots such as the difficulties to build a bridge in the African savanna or to maintain order in a multiethnic team. Two solitary lions, without any links with a herd, fight two men, away from their family or, for Charles Remington, without any family at all. And now you can try to figure out what the movie is really about : is it a film about the couple civilization/nature or a film dealing with some of our most ancestral fears ? or is it even about something else ? If a film can raise such questions, it surely deserves a little consideration.

He also discovers workers are being attacked by lions.  In this remote area, this is hardly surprising.  The frequency and number of attacks, though, are off the chart.  Not only are the workers and Patterson terrorized, many of the workers leave the job site, preventing further construction.  Patterson must find a way to rid the place of the lions.  He's an engineer and amateur hunter, not a game expert.

Patterson and others try numerous things to trap and kill the lions, or prevent them from entering camp to no avail before a number of victims are taken.  The first time I watched this, I got chills every time a lion attacked.  Imagine trying to survive in such a place.  Patterson eventually bags the lions, and work resumes.

A character named Remington is brought in near the end of the picture.  He is a fictional character, but the interaction between Patterson, the natives and him reflects the development of the relationship between Americans, Europeans, Africans, and Indians during the Victorian era.

Prior to reviewing this DVD, I read Lt. Col. Patterson's book, ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.""  This is a sensational story, and I needed a reality check.  There is artistic license, as usual, in the movie.  But in this case, I find that license a reflection of the real life of Lt. Col. Patterson, who spent many years working in various parts of Africa, living in primitive conditions, and when he found time, hunting various game.

The numbers killed by lions are staggering when compared to those of other instances of man-eaters.  Lt. Col. Patterson worked and hunted passionately.  This is well worth watching, but not by small children.",1170979200,6,1897,4.86875

The movie is, in fact, a pretty accurate retelling of the hair-raising story of ""the Maneaters of Tsavo,"" and, as a matter of historical record, these lions WERE seen, by the native Africans and the Indian railway workers, as nothing short of magical devils. Understandable, given their incredible ability to kill, and kill again, then slip away in the night. As a white European, Patterson did not, himself, believe in witchcraft; but even he might have begun to have some doubts after a while (read his own excellent (and excessively modest) account, ""The Maneaters of Tsavo,"" which is still in print). One wonders how many project engineers today would take the risks he did to finish an assignment! I own the DVD and still watch the movie from time to time; knowing how it ends in no way spoils the tense enjoyment (if that kind of film is your cup of tea), any more than knowing how World War II ended spoils a second, third, or tenth viewing of ""Patton.""

If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!

Now, on to my review of The Ghost and the Darkness on DVD.

I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.

Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.

The film is based on the true story of ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo"", the tale of two rogue lions in victorian British East-Africa who kill unsuspecting railroad workers by the bushel.  While viewing, I couldn't help but notice comparisons between this film and the classic shark flick, ""Jaws"".  Val Kilmer as Patterson is the supervisor of building a railroad bridge,(Chief Brody in Jaws).  Michael Douglas is the eccentric big-game hunter hired to kill the lions, (Robert Shaw as Quint).  As the shark in Jaws repeatedly outwits and outmanuevers the shark hunters the same can be said for the lions in this film.  While this may sound like cinematic plagerism, it is infact art imitating life as this story is based on true characters and events.  The film is rated R due to brief scenes of violence and gore.

I am still troubled with the ""remington"" character... the vehicle to get Douglas into the movie, the vehicle to give Douglas top billing... a movie that was and is best left to Kilmer's character.  It would have been better for Douglas to have read the great adventures of Hunter, Selous, Bell and Corbitt to fashion a more realistic African hunter to team up with Patterson.  Still, it is a good movie in the African adventure mode and tradition.  This is a movie to enjoy .. it is entertainment.. watch the movie, turn back the clock to the late 1800's where the lions did rule the night and humans were far down on the food chain save for their courage and their Nitro Express rifles... the lion is on the prowl, it is after you...how will you sleep tonight?",1127433600,8,1009,4.427027027027027
855700,4,6304353634,"This film is nothing less than solid entertainment with decent characters.  More importantly, it has something that few movies have these days:  Repeatable watchability.  Of the dozens of DVDs on my shelves, only a few get watched more than once or twice.  This is one of them.  It's a great summer movie; something to sit down to with a bowl of popcorn.  It's not deep.  It's not provoking.  It's simply drive-in fun.  Looking at some of the professional reviews that were published at the time of the movie's release, I have to wonder at the mentality of those who could never write, create or act in anything yet feel qualified to belittle.  ""Val Kilmer's accent comes and goes"" one reviewer wrote.  Okay, so what?  So does mine.  ""The animatronic lions used throughout the film look terrible"" wrote another.  Oh yeah?  You mean in the two brief scenes where they were used?  How about the fact that live lions were used for 99% of the filming?  ""The movie was boring in its set-up"".  You mean as the cast of characters that we do really come to care about are developed?  That's something we all used to enjoy before the onset of the video game-style presentation that movies use so often these days.  Finally, ""the movie alluded to the difficulties in railroad construction in colonial Africa and the friction between Africans and imported Indian labor, but never developed either theme"".  Wow.  I guess this was supposed to be a PBS docudrama.  That WOULD have been a snoozer.  Glad I missed out on the finer points of labor relations in colonial Africa.  No this wasn't Schindler's List, but I've only been able to watch that emotionally difficult movie once.  It's simply too powerful.  Niether is it Saving Private Ryan or Sophie's Choice.

855701,5,6304353634,"The Ghost and the Darkness is about the two maneating lions that terrorized the crew building a bridge at a desolate, nowhere place called Tsavo, Africa, circa 1890s, a place that had long been known as an area of active maneating lions. The original account written by Col. John H. Patterson, the engineer responsible for building the bridge and killing the lions (and played superbly by Val Kylmer), is one of the greatest Classics of African Hunting Literature ever written and known very well by legions of non-Bambi outdoor enthusiasts around the world. Subsequent accounts, the best of which is the well-researched wrtiing of 20th Century African hunter Peter Hathaway Capstick in his ""Death in the Silent Places"" and ""The Maneaters of Tsavo"" have become nearly as popular.

  The movie does take some liberties with events but most of the key scenes in the movie actually happened though perhaps in a bit different context. For example, the movie has the den of the maneaters being found prior to the lions' deaths but it was actually found some weeks afterward. But that wasn't the point in 1898. The cave actually contained (as in the movie) the skeletal remains of hundreds of human victims, so many, in fact, the probability is that den had been used by maneaters for centuries. Not too surprising the crews and locals felt Tsavo was a place of Evil. Adding credibility to the longevity of use theory is the fact that four other maneaters who ran up a score of 50 souls in that same area were killed in a single day by hunter Robert Foran - in 1947. But wait. Professional hunter John Kingsley-Heath killed another maneater there too - in 1965. But wait - Peter Capstick's boss was killed and eaten not too far from Tsavo on Labor Day 1974. That's right - 1974. Where were YOU in 1974?

  The African and Indian cultures of the 1890s weren't, and aren't, the United States. The liklihood these two lions would quickly be seen as ""more than just lions"", as some unstoppable Evil is more like a guarantee. The abject Terror of 2000-3000 African and Indian laborers was a real as Death itself. That Terror is amply displayed in the movie, but is still understated.

  The movie's lions, even with their ominous role as ""more than lions"", act very much like real maneaters did, and do. And when they do it in a joust with unarmed humans, they usually win, bigtime, and assorted gore and human body parts are a consistant by-product of such festivities. I've never never read anything at all about a famous lioneater.

  The movie's filming and effects are very good. Michael Douglas, as the ficticious hunter Remington, supports Kylmer well, and with a well-done, darkly amusing style. The ""shock"" scenes are ""SHOCK"" scenes, especially one in particular. You will FEEL your blood pressure drop to zero only to be red-lining again in a flash. You WILL hold your breath and you may regain it. Seriously, allowing a young child to watch this is probably not the best of ideas, and not because of the gore but because many of the scenes of the primal, nightmarish Horror these maneating lions deliver take place after dark and ""after dark"" is already an ""iffy"" proposition for many kids without the fangs of Hades clashing in their minds.

Val Kilmer and Michael Douglass give superb performances.  Val Kilmer plays an ordinary engineer and bridge-builder who is plucked from his desk job in Ireland, and faced with the starkest terror of his life. At the bridge site, a man-eating lion is picking off the construction workers.  The lion drags them from their hospital beds or picks them off in broad daylight.  This behaviour is highly unusual for the African lion.  The natives soon believe that this is not a lion but the devil - the ghost and the darkness.  Douglass plays a brave hunter brought in to bring the lions down.

You've probably already heard the essential of the story, but let me just add that this movie is perhaps the best Beast-above-water-movies ever made (compared of course to Jaws, Brotherhood of the Wolf and similar movies about beasts out of animals that do exist, unlike Kong and Godzilla and the dinosaurs of Jurrasic Park -yes, well, you get my meaning...).

More than once during The Ghost and The Darkness you'll hold your breath, and sit paralyzed to your chair, because it is so impressive filmed, edited and (of course) directed and acted. Kilmer and Douglas are a great theme! And the movie has quite a lot remembarable scenes, and the story (though perhaps not as true as it claims to be..?) is solid, and well worth making a movie of.

During the course of the construction, over 140 workers were killed by 2 male lions over a 9 month period.  Patterson must kill the lions and complete construction or he will lose his job.  Michael Douglas makes an appearance in this film as a hunter who helps Patterson with killing the lions.  The lions are on exhibit in a Chicago museum to this day. I would not recommed that any children under the age of 12 see this movie because it is a bit gory.

855758,4,6304353634,"William Goldman's script adapted from Lt. Col. John Patterson's tale of a pair of man-eating lions wreaking havoc on a railroad construction camp in 19th-century colonial Africa. A pleasant action film which, although somewhat uneven, presents a good adventure story to the likes of a Rudyard Kipling (author of The Man Who Would Be King; The Jungle Book) short story.

  Patterson (Val Kilmer) is given a deadline to build trestle bridge but is impeded from doing so by the lions. Construction comes to a near halt after Indian and African laborers ascribe supernatural powers to the lions. Determined to challenge the credulity of the workers and complete his project, Patterson decides to hunt them down. The lions are elusive however and he obtains help from an American expatriate lion hunter (Michael Douglas)to take care of the pesky felines. The lions are eventually dispatched but not before tragedy befalls the characters.

  The film is well paced with a decent plot line. One theme conveyed in the film is the battle between credulance and empirical thought. Patterson, the engineer, is the voice of science and reason which treats the lions as nothing more than a wild nuisance that can be easily disposed with. The laborers reflect credulence and superstition: people who would prefer to accept nature as a divine force that no one can master. As he hunts the lions, Patterson himself abandons his empirical methodologies and adopts a more spiritual side in order to understand the bestial forces of nature. This theme works well in depicting the socio-cultural contrasts prevalent in colonial times during the 19th century. The acting was decent although Val Kilmer, despite his amazing acting talents, doesn't come off as an Irishman very well. The film has beautiful cinematography and a good soundtrack.

  This is a good adventure film that can be enjoyed by the whole family.",1091491200,4,1895,5.106796116504855

John Patterson (Val Kilmer) is sent to Tsavo, Africa to build a bridge across a river, thus allowing the British railroad to enter deeper into Africa, bringing civilization and advancement into the Dark Continent. Once Patterson arrives, he is greeted by a situation in which a man-eating lion is harassing the workers and delaying the construction of the bridge. He goes out one night and kills the lion with one shot, winning the confidence of the workers and, therefore, pushing the project ahead of schedule.
Unfortunately, two more man-eating lions begin to make daily harassments on the work camp, killing over 30 men, and eventually halting the construction, in spite of all that Patterson can do.
Enter Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), famous and professional wildlife hunter.
The rest of the drama unfolds as we see how Remington and Patterson deal with the crisis as the death toll reaches over a hundred.
Contrary to many previous reviews on the movie, The Ghost and the Darkness is an excellent film. Brilliant cinematography, breathtaking scenery, and beautiful and robust music are only a part of this great adventure yarn (which is based, stronger than you might think, on the true story). The acting of all the actors, once again contrary to popular criticism, is very good; not ""over-the-top"" at all. The film has a robust and powerful feel that accurately echoes the ruggedness and strength of Africa and the great men who tried to tame her. The authenticity of the film's props (costumes, weapons, tools, vehicles, etc.) is also impressive. The special effects are perfectly convincing and the lions are real.
The film has a good length (an hour and forty minutes) and never loses its pace or sense of direction. The film is straightforward and, at many moments, downright powerful. The tension is strong and, yes, this film is better than ""Jaws"" in every way, not to mention more mature than the sharkie movie. And, ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" is much more than a mere thriller. It is also a historical drama of high caliber.
Warning: If you are a feminist, you will find this movie too ""macho"". But if you admire the indomitable spirit of the Victorian era's adventurers, you will appreciate the film's strong (and realistically imperfect) characters. And sorry, there are no sugar-cutie boys who run to Angelina Jolie for help and no Super-Chicks who come to save the day (thank goodness).

Kilmer is saddled with an Irish accent that he can't maintain for the whole film, and Douglas attempts to be Crocodile Hunter Jim Irwin.  Only John Kani as Samuel, Bernard Hill as the doctor, and Tom Wilkinson as the despicably hateable Beaumont emerge with fine performances.
Admittedly, some of the scenes with the lion attacks were effectively frightening and there is one in a dream sequence that is actually breathtaking.

Val Kilmer plays engineer John Patterson, who has always been able to overcome all obstacles through sheer will and hard work, until, that is, he gets sent to Africa to build a bridge.  In Africa, the country of his dreams, John's work is sabotaged not by man but by beast.  Two man-eating lions are mauling and dragging off workers not only in their sleep but eventually in broad daylight, completely against the nature of their species.  They kill not for food but for ""sport.""  Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), an experienced hunter, is called in to help restore calm by killing the lions.
This might have been an exciting story if the filmmakers had not chosen to ratchet up the terror by making these lions seem supernaturally invincible.  The lions are imbued with so much (supposedly scary) intelligence that they trick Remington and Patterson more than once so they can make their kills. They become evil instead of unpredictable.  As the film progresses,  everything gets even more unbelievably hokey as the actors strap on their machismo. Still, the scenes with the lions are chair-grabbing tense; it's only after the scenes have ended that the viewer is likely to see how ridiculous it all is.
The best part of this film comes before the lions appear, when Patterson is suffering from the pride we know he'll lose, and as the camera pans over the African savannah.  But most viewers aren't watching this film for its character development and cinematography.  If only the suspense had not been artificially heightened, this could have been a solid thriller.
This is a decent escapist movie with not much to offer on second viewing.  I'd make this a rental instead of a purchase.",1085097600,25,1828,4.883495145631068

He is thrilled when he is hired by Robert Beaumont (Tom Wilkinson). However, all the excitement he brings on his travel will soon end and turn into fear and despair as he encounters one of the most amazing true stories ever told.
The construction site is, to all accounts, cursed. There are two teams who don't necessarilly see eye to eye, and the construction itself is a daunting task. Beaumont is a mean man who enjoys torturing and pressing his employees (even from the distance between England and Kenya). But these are the least of the problems that Patterson has to face. The site is also under siege by two maneaters, two lions to which the locals gave the names of The Ghost and The Darkness.
These lions don't behave like normal lions do. They work as a team and they don't only hunt for food, they hunt for fun. Their attacks leave a bloody trail in puts the greatest fear into the construction workers hearts. Patterson needs to do something to keep the work on schedule, but none of his ideas seem to work in stoping the two beasts. Thus enters Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), an american hunting legend who lives with a tribe of bushmen.
Together they fight the lions in every way they can, but in the end, not everyone will survive...
The ghost and the darkness is a really great film. It's greatest strength is the suspense that the lion attacks bring with them. How many times can Patterson and Remington face death? Who will die next? Will they kill the animals? There is no way you can take your eyes off of the screen.
Kilmer and Douglas give both fine performances, and are greatly helped by the supporting cast of Wilkinson, Kani and Hill. Hopkins does a great directing job by creating the suspense and the action needed to tell the story, helped by a great score from Jerry Goldsmith.

The lions seemed so calculating and powerful that many believed them to be demons in the form of a lion. After being killed, the remains ended up in the Field Museum in Chicago.

855825,4,6304353634,"Despite obvious flaws in the film's historical accuracy, the film overall depicts what happened in 1895 in Africa as two lions for whatever reason went on a killing spree, Val Kilmer stars as a railroad construction engineer who is hired to build a railraod in Africa thus beating the competiton, he is hired by Tom Wilkinson(Rush Hour) who is the boss you would just love to hate, as Kilmer begins his job, his hired help begins to die by being attacked by the lions, Kilmer begins a manhunt & thus the bridge's construction halted, as Wilkinson grows more impatient with Kilmer's delay, he then sends a professional hunter in the form of Michael Douglas in a somewhat unconventional role, Douglas does not appear until the second hour, this film really belongs to Kilmer as he & Douglas become the hunted, it is clear that the lions are playing with them, & that even Douglas is puzzed at their behavoir, when they think there is one, they discover that there are two, they even bait a trap for them that has little or no effect, the lions stalk Kilmer as if they are saving him for last, won't spoil the ending for those who have not seen it, except to say that the ending is intense as man battles the beast, this is a very gripping movie, the lions are now on display in a museum in Chicago, & they are frightning to look at, you almost sense that they are looking at you, which makes this film all the more scarier!!!

855826,3,6304353634,"I would call a lion the black soul of africa after seeing this title ""THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"".for this chilling tale is vey much so based on a true story.where the hunters become the hunted..this is a tense, terrfic and true adventure set in 1896 EAST Africa.
Two key actors Michael Douglas and val kilmer are brought into the movie. Ghost and the Darkness simply mean ""Two man eaters""The beasts are on a man eating rampage,they hunt together.with no fear of man.two killing machines KIlling for sport rather than nurishment..
MEAN WHILE the railway construction Project, val kilmer was meant to build is on hold.as they get a top big game hunter REMINGTON (thats when Douglas comes into the picture).into the hunt...
But these lions are smart.they no the land better than the people let alone some outside  game hunter,who is only in for the money. Egineer Paterson (Kilmer)AND lion hunter (douglas) now set out to stop the devils workers.in other words stop these unstoppable monstes.only the most incredible parts of the story are true in sible (africa)""Breathtaking and thrillng!""its time to prey for the hunters.",1031529600,,1121,4.994652406417113
855827,4,6304353634,"There is something more to this story than hunting down a pair of man-killing lions.  In fact, I originally didn't want to see this because I am tender hearted when it comes to animals.  And it's to the films credit that I understood why these two lions had to be killed.  Better that they be killed than innocent children mangled and killed.
The film, and I quite realize that many of the true story's details were changed in order to tell the story the director wanted told, pits man against the law of the wild.  The hunters are flesh and blood, and they stalk their prey as if they were the law tracking down a couple of murderers.  And yet, they are not portrayed as evil.  You sense that the hunters are not sportsmen, but protectors.  There's tragedy in the situation.  There's a sense of man's failure to be able to cohabit this planet with the rest of its inhabitants.
And yet, the movie somehow fell short of expectations.
It is a good movie though it will hurt animal lovers like myself to watch it through.",1027987200,,1018,4.435483870967742

Val Kilmer is perfect in the role as bridge-building, action hero who has never even seen a lion before going to Africa.
But like a real hero should he never flinches... when confronted by the fact that lions had attacked and killed some of his workers he merely states that, ""With any luck I'll sort it out tonight."" After which he picks up his rifle and climbs a tree to await the lion.
Wonderful film, and great testimonial to the power of Reason and Will against savagery and fear.",1027641600,2,667,4.430894308943089
855895,4,6304353634,"I watched the Ghost and Darkness yesterday, and I thought it was a very entertaining thriller, with above average direction, acting, and cinematography.
It is another Monster/animal against man story, but what makes the film different from the dozens of such movies, is the authenticity of the story, based on true events that actually happened at the turn of the 20th century in Kenya.
Watching G&D, you can not help but deduce similarities with Spielberg's Jaws, even though the style of both films is different, and whereas Jaws has had a huge impact on its audience and was highly praised, G&D was not very successful at its time of release.
The similarities lie in the fact that both stories are based on true events, but dramatized for the screen, Jaws on the Great White attacks of 1912 in New Jersey via Peter Benchley's best seller, and G&D on the true events of two maneating lions who feasted on more than 200 of our kind.(The actual lions of Tsavo are preserved in the Field Musuem in Chicago
Both films, brought these two events to our attention, as both were largely forgotten or unheard of before the films.
The experienced shark hunter Robert Powell, who knows it all but has yet to face his greatest challenge in the unusual behavior of the monster fish, is similar to Michael Douglas's character. Both men end their lives tragically in the mouths of the predators they supposedly were the only people who can kill them.
But G&D has excellent cinematography, and the lions attacks are very well digitally put with the help of fast editing, preceding the scene in Gladiator with the tigers in the ring but more effective.
Val Kilmer,gives a very good performance,but I thought Michael Douglas was miscast,although his acting is as always very good.
So G&D is a good thriller, that will keep you at the edge of your seat, and make you reflect upon how powerful nature and its predators can be, and while we have infringed on its territory for years, it is when it fights back that we become vulnerable.",1025481600,,2017,4.732954545454546

The acting is suberb.  Douglas and Kilmer hit the mark over and over.  There is some amazing scenery, and some of the camerawork made me want to rewind it and watch it over and over.  The story was excellent.  It seemed to keep moving constantly.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for entertainment.

855900,4,6304353634,"The Ghost and the Darkness, an unexpected, dark, tantalising thriller is a total success. I didn't read much into this movie before viewing, but I came out really satisfied and although many critics disliked this movie, I thought it was highly entertaining, well executed and very scary. The film succeeds a lot thanks to the direction and visuals; the lions look truly fantastic! Wow! The other reason the movie really made me keep watching was for the atmosphere of the film. The camera angles, backgrounds, lions POV and stuff like that really gives the movie a real feeling. I personally felt like I was in Africa, running from the Ghost and the Darkness, experiencing the true terror of their roar. The film also gets high marks thanks to its very believable performances. Michael Douglas takes a surprising back seat, but it still a strong character in the film and plays out his tough character well. Val Kilmer is the star though. This is one of his best performances, he masters an Irish accent accurately, is a believable loving husband and a likeable bridge builder. The movie is not perfect however. I didn't really appreciate the voice-overs by the African friend and some of the lion attack sequences are cut too short. Despite that, the film is an atmospheric, amazingly true experience that - if you're like me - will leave you shaking and breathless.
DVD STUFF: 1/5. Theatrical trailer and viewing options. How about commentaries, bloopers or an insight into the fascinating training of the lions? That would give this disappointing DVD way more credit.",1003276800,31,1570,4.928301886792453

855902,5,6304353634,"I am very angered that this film was not more successful than it was.  However, at the time, the world was in love with happy, singing lions thanks to Disney, so that could possibly be the effect.
First, I think I should inform almost everyone who reads this that, despite what you hear, almost everything that happened in this story is true.  The hunters in the boxcar missing the lion at close range over and over?  True.  The lions killing just to kill.  True.  Constant rifles being dropped, thus allowing the lions to escape.  True.  Patterson jumping out of a tree and killing the lion as it was EATING HIM!  TRUE.  Everything in this film is true, and if you read any of the books about it, you'll see that it really did happen.  Now onto the review.
There's one bad thing about the acting in this movie: Val Kilmer's accent.  It's not quite realistic enough.  Whenver things get intense, he loses it.  However, the rest of the acting is superb.  Michael Douglas does a fabulous job as the Man With No Name character, and the supporting cast of natives is great.  Fear can be seen by everyone, and more importantly, it is real fear.
No on to the script.  I have always been a huge fan of William Goldman's since I saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid when I was 12, but he truly does a brilliant job here.  The lines are great and the characters are what they are intended to be, either likable, mysterious, or jerks.  The only thing that irks me about the writing is how the character of Remmington(or Redbeard, as it was intended) given a history.  I know that Goldman was forced to write this in, but it truly makes the character look like a wuss instead of keeping his air of mystery around him.  Other than that, Goldman's script is terrific.
The directing by Stephen Hopkins is right on and as tense as it should be.  When there is supposed to be fear or paranoia invoked, it is right there and in your face.  This movie also contains some of the most beautiful scenery of the African continent I've seen since OUT OF AFRICA.  Hopkins photographs everything in Tsavo in a washed out sephia that works very well since Tsavo is supposed to be surrounded by death, whether it be from Malaria, religious fights, or those pesky lions.
The one thing to me, besides Goldman's script, that stands out is the spectacular musical score.  I can't think right off hand who did the music, but it is PERFECT.  It's dreamy and intense and airy at just the right times.  If I could find it anywhere, I would definitely buy it, and I do not buy movie scores much.  It works with the picture beautifully.
As you can tell, I love this film.  I think it is great and powerful and I think everyone should watch it, especially if you love adventure stories or incredible true tales.  For more insights on the film and story, I also reccomend you read Goldman's ""Which Lie Did I Tell?""  It adds insight on this truly terrific movie.",993945600,5,2924,4.450094161958568
855903,2,6304353634,"Film of this sort had great potential, but the lions just were not scary enough.

855991,5,6304353634,"I usually don't leave reviews  for films that have this many reviews by other viewer because I am usually just repeating what others have said.  However, in this case I am a real fan of this film and thought I would leave review anyway.  Initially I did not want to see this film because I had read reviews that said this film was just a standard Hollywood film that injected white males into Africa to save the locals from danger.  I'm glad I finally ignored these reviews and viewed this film.  While Kilmer and Douglas (especially Douglas who breaks from his victimized male roles) provide fine acting I enjoy this film for it's basic but intriguing story line, it's beautiful scenery and the background music.  I have never been to Africa and have never had a great desire to visit.  However, this film shows a beautiful land and the music provides the right feel and now I find myself hoping to one day vist and tour the land.
I do not know too many people who have seen this movie but those who have agree with me that this is movie that feels real. For those like myself who are unfamiliar with this story they will be drawn to the story line and unlike some films will not be sure that they can predict the ending.  A good family movie as long as the kids are probably 8 or older.  Some kids may be frightened by the lions but there is no real bad language or gore that may offend some viewers.

This is a great adventure story with well drawn-out characters. Tom Wilkinson makes Beaumont so despicable that you just want to throw HIM to the lions and let them have at it. Michael Douglas is also very good as Remington. But the film belongs to Val Kilmer as Patterson, the Irishman who comes to build a bridge and finds himself being blamed for the lion attacks, and John Kani as Samuel, the tribal chief and Patterson's friend and foreman. Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score perfectly captures the essence of Africa (African chants are incorporated into the score). Director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond demonstrates with this film that he is a master of the widescreen format, and his shots of the African landscape are breathtaking. Then, of course, there are the lions themselves. The attack scenes are VERY well done, and Zsigmond's shots of the lions' eyes are still stuck in my head. Add to this some terrific sound effects and you have a real winner.",987638400,5,1125,4.798969072164948
855993,3,6304353634,"This movie is based on the book ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo"" by Col. John Henry Patterson.  Col. Patterson's job was to build a bridge over the Tsavo river.  Unfortunately for many of his workers, two lions decided to stop by for a few snacks.  Human snacks.  The lions began midnight raids on the camps and completely terrorized the workers hired to help build the bridge.  These lions actually worked together - something that was unheard of.  Col. Patterson's workers abandoned the area and left him to fend for himself.  A good portion of this movie is dedicated to Col. Patterson's adventures in tracking down and killing the two lions.

What I Liked:
What I did like about the film was that it was almost completely true to the book.  The scene where Col. Patterson built a trap for the lions and the workers were on the other end still couldn't shoot the lion that entered it?  That happened.  The part where they moved the hospital and soaked the original one with animal blood to attract the lions and the lions decided to go somewhere else for their snack that night? That really happened, too.

What I Didn't Like:
I found Mr. Kilmer to be too young to play the role of Patterson. I wasn't convinced that he could be Col. Patterson.

Michael Douglas plays the role of Charles Remington.  The Remington character is a composite of several big game hunters.  This character did not exist in the book ""The Man-Eaters of Tsavo"".  I found the Remington character to be an obnoxious know-it-all.  He gets eaten by one of the maneaters toward the end of the film.  I didn't like him anyway.

Observations:
There are several scenes with members of the Maasai tribe hunting down the lions with Patterson and Remington.  That did not happen in the book, but was interesting to see how the Maasai hunt lions.  Anyway, the Massai, along with Remington, started at one end of the bush trying to flush out the lions with Patterson at the other end ready to shoot. One of the lions did come out of the bush right in front of Patterson. Patterson tried to shoot, but his gun misfired.  In the movie, Kilmer was using a single barrel gun - in the book it was a double barrel gun.",973728000,,2170,4.538659793814433

Michael Douglas is quite good in his role as the big game  hunter while Val Kilmer makes the most as the beleagured architect.  John  Kani as a native interpretor and bridge builder does an outstanding acting  job, also.
There are three truly frightening scenes: one involving  Kilmer's wife; another at the lions' lair where their victims' bones are  discovered; and the final battle between man and beast.
