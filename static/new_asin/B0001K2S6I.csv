2006589,5,B0001K2S6I,"I have to agree with the other two reviewers and say, yes...this is a reflexology DVD that you do not want to be without. Ann Gillanders (the professional reflexology host of the DVD) is extremely knowledgeable about reflexology and the functions of the human body. Her wisdom shines though this DVD and I trust her wisdom completely. I have now ordered two of her books and will be reading them soon!

Now..back to the DVD. It covers a wide range of techniques for womens health issues from infertility to menopause. It also covers techniques for colicky babies and stress in children. At the end of the DVD, Miss Gillanders demonstrates a full reflexology treatment that can be used on males or females.

The camera angles throughout the DVD are very clear and there is never a question as to where Miss Gillanders is placing her thumbs for treatment. Also, from time to time, a reflexology chart will pop up on the screen in conjunction to the area Miss Gillanders is treating at the moment.

This DVD never becomes boring and is a joy to watch. I definitely recommend this one to any person interested in the art of reflexology. 5 stars to Ann Gillanders and her DVD crew!",1146960000,,1176,4.644230769230769
2006590,5,B0001K2S6I,"I recommend this DVD to all my friends (too bad not all of them are interested:) It's divided in short(about 5 minutes), detailed episodes which are easy to find and interesting to watch.

This DVD definitely would make a great gift for youself or your friends.",1135814400,,261,4.673913043478261
2006591,5,B0001K2S6I,"This is a warm, personal and very informative program.  It gets right to the point of the methods they use to treat many different conditions.  The demonstrations are very clear and the explanations of why and how the techniques are used made it very easy to do. It's also real easy to go back and review each part because of the way they made the menus.  It covers a lot of ground, but each part talks about problems that are likely to occur at particular times of life so it's easy to follow.  And this isn't one of those dry lectures or a super-slick commercial either.  Ann has such a great personality and sense of humor, I almost feel like I know her.  I recommend this very highly to anyone interested in reflexology.",1091059200,,724,4.406015037593985
2006592,5,B0001K2S6I,"I can't tell you how glad I am to find this video.  Finally they have made a program just for women that goes into detail and shows very clearly the technique used to treat specific areas for specific ailments.  It's a bit more advanced than other videos I've seen, but that is a good thing.  The little drawings accompanying the demonstrations are also a great help so you can see exactly the place to work on while she is working.  Even though she is working outdoors, which gives it a bright and airy feeling, the photography is excellent and you get a clear view of everything.  If I could only have one video about reflexology, this would be it!",1014163200,,650,4.428571428571429
2006593,5,B0001K2S6I,"The first reflexology video with Ann Gillanders was great, and this one is even better!  It has more details of reflexology techniques and talks about more specifics just for women.  I found it fascinating to see her methods for treating common ailments at every stage of a woman's life.  The locale she chose is beautiful, once again, so it's pleasant to watch as well as being very informative.  Very inspiring!",1012003200,,413,4.857142857142857

8013393,5,B0001K2S6I,"This is a Master DVD for reflexologists looking to enhance their skills in helping women with their health issues.  Also great for self education.

So happy my husband gave it to me for Valentine's Day.  This is the ultimate gift I wanted to receive this time.

Highly recommend to learn from the Master!",1361750400,,304,4.679245283018868
8013394,5,B0001K2S6I,"This also offers alternative methods than the other books that were required for my class.  I will use this in my Alternative Therapy clinic in addressing blockages my clients, as well as myself, are trying to overcome.",1361750400,,219,4.918918918918919
8013395,1,B0001K2S6I,"The majority of this DVD is for infertility, breastfeeding, PMS, etc. I am out of my childbearing years so it was returned.
The lady spends way too much time talking about health related stuff most people already know. It shows her massaging peoples feet and a pic pops up on the screen for about 2 seconds that shows you which AREA she is massaging and that is as far as teaching goes. The camera is positioned so you cannot even see the foot to see exactly what she is massaging. I am somewhat familiar with reflexology and did not learn anything from her whatsoever.
That this video is more geared toward women of childbearing years was not specified.
She also calls herself a ""healer"".  There is only ONE healer and you are not Him.
Dont waste your time.",1322956800,,758,4.492753623188406
8013396,1,B0001K2S6I,"this is a useless product. it's not worth the time or money to buy this dvd. i tried it and with no results whatsoever. do not be fool by this woman named ann gillanders. i can see that this dvd is a total hoax. very unsatisfied and would never buy from her again.....
