That aside, it is a good film well done but a little hard to follow. The ending makes it worth buying- all thing considered. None the less, be aware of what I mentioned.",1469664000,,285,4.2

8435561,5,B004M5J7YO,It was everything I could have expected. The DVD arrived quickly and was a flashback to my childhood. Loved every minute of it.,1388016000,,127,4.565217391304348
8435562,5,B004M5J7YO,"Okay, quickly, this movie is EXACTLY what anyone should expect - pure, escapist, ""relive being eight years old again"" fun. You get the real feeling of a desperate plan and with our hero, Ultraman Zero, stuck in a parallel universe means all sorts of problems. However, Zero makes friends with some pretty powerful allies which bumps up the cool factor by a hundred-fold. Well worth the price for this edge-of-your-seat adventure.",1346976000,,429,5.056338028169014
