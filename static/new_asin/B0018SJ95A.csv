The bad rating is due to the product being sold, not a rating of the real feature film. The feature film is actually really good and enjoyable. It has more of the movie magic visuals. I first saw this movie on a airplane to China, and have been unable to find it else where, so I finally decided to pay the price of this thinking it was worth it. :/

See the attached pictures. The differences are subtle the image I was able to find, but the movie version is definitely more visually stunning.",1418860800,4,757,4.361702127659575
