8563604,4,B00B7F0UUW,"I had hoped (esp. with the listing of Asian actor names: Luo Zha De Er and Mi Gao Jie Zhi) that this was an original Asian production of Shakespeare's play, but no such luck. It is simply a 2007 Asian release of the Roger Daltrey version of the '80s from the BBC Shakespeare collection. It's a great production; probably the best committed to film so far, but in the case of this purchase a disappointment to discover that it was not an Asian production. The seller here has conveniently sized the cover image so that the English names are not readable, and added some Chinese names out of thin air, perhaps even to fool buyers like me into ordering the disc. That certainly worked - everyone else, you are hereby warned against making the same mistake I did.",1402444800,,759,4.507246376811594
