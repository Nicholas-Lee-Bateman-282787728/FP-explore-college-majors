The quality of the cinematography is quite good, but the films are too hokey--even for me.  These were clearly earlier in his career and too many aspects were just too silly.

The othres are a bit predictable and there is a lot riding here and there, which is often great to watch, but sometimes a bit irrelevant for the story. Randolph Scott is always exellent and raises the level of these films. He is so perfect in these kind of westerns.

7665145,4,B01BPK82GC,"I only recently began viewing Scott's westerns, not really knowing they existed. They would have been new in the theaters when I was growing up and as a teenager, but never paid any attention to them at the time, which was rather unnatural because my sister and I attended Saturday matinees for most of the fifties and a lot of those were westerns. Now here I am watching these great movies and enjoying Scott's portrayals like no other that I know of. Wayne had his way of doing it and so did many other western stars, but I feel Scott's were rather unique in that they were a ""thinking"" mans way of doing it. He had his way at looking at things and acting upon them which I find different from the others and really enjoy his movies. It gave me something to think about after watching the film. Not all are of the same caliber, but many I will watch again and again. The Nevadan, Decision At Sundown, Colt .45, Rage at Dawn are the ones I have enjoyed the most.",1469404800,8,963,4.2967032967032965

7665158,5,B01BPK82GC,"Just in case you're confused, Mill Creek has released two DVD sets bearing the same title  The Randolph Scott Round-Up.

The first set  not marked Volume One &nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/available-elsewhere-on-Amazon/dp/B011PS4YGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">available elsewhere on Amazon,</a>&nbsp;consists of

1955 - A Lawless Street (Technicolor.  Joseph H. Lewis, director) 1.37:1
1957 - The Tall T (Technicolor. Budd Boetticher, director) 1.85:1
1957 - Decision At Sundown (Technicolor. Budd Boetticher, director) 1.85:1
1958 - Buchanan Rides Alone (Columbia Color. Budd Boetticher, director) 1.85:1
1959 - Ride Lonesome (Eastman Color. Budd Boetticher, director) 2.35:1
1960 - Comanche Station (Eastman Color. Budd Boetticher, director) 2.35:1

The second set  not marked Volume Two  being discussed here, consists of

1943 -- The Desperadoes (Technicolor. Charles Vidor, director)
1950 -- The Nevadan (Cinecolor. Gordon Douglas, director)
1951 -- Santa Fe (Technicolor. Irving Pichel, director)
1951 -- Man in the Saddle (Technicolor. Andr de Toth, director)
1952 -- Hangman's Knot (Technicolor. Roy Huggins, director)
1953 -- Stranger Wore A Gun (Technicolor. Andr de Toth, director)
The last was filmed in stereo, widescreen (1.85:1), 3D -- presented here in mono, standard academy ratio, and flat.

Once again, Columbia/Sony/Mill Creek has spared NO expense on the transfers -- there are NO anamorphic enhancements, NO subtitles/captions, NO trailers, NO commentaries, NO language options, NO menu chapter stops, NO liner notes, NO extras, NO nothing besides the films.

But again, at least we have the films at a most reasonable price -- but I would gladly pay a premium for fresh, higher quality scans and much needed restorative work.

Image quality appears the same as the previously released individual titles. There is substantial room for image improvement all around. These films *deserve* to be remastered from the original camera negatives, or tri-color separations, and released on Blu-ray. Most of these were ""Color by Technicolor"" when those words actually meant the finest and most accurate color and image quality available! Cinecolor was a two-color, low cost competitor to Technicolor -- not bad but not great.

Audio quality is clean mono with dialog never buried in the mix. Subtitles are missed.

Menu is *bare* bones. This time generic font is used for the film titles on the discs. Click on a title and the film begins.

Packaging. The cover front and back are very good. The cover is attractive and highlights the fact that the star of these films is Randolph Scott. The back cover has thumbnails of the original posters that were used on the American posters and individual Sony-release DVDs. The discs themselves are black-labeled with undersized film titles and an undersized Columbia logo -- topped by an ill-placed Mill Creek ad at the top of each disc.

Entertainment. These films range from pretty good to excellent. There's not a dud in the group -- my personal favorite being ""Hangman's Knot"".

Final thoughts. Despite my complaints, this is another outstanding set at a great price. I'm glad to have it until Columbia/Sony does it right on Blu-ray.",1460764800,37,3237,5.560081466395112
