8715785,4,B00XDCB6AK,"The original title of this French made film was Victor Young Perez as this is essentially a biopic of that mans life. Born Tunisian, but also a Jew, he seemed to have boxing in his blood. He gets talent spotted by a French scout and taken off to make his fortune in The City of Light.

Now he was actually World Flyweight Champion in 1931 and 1932 and so was very well known. Then he went off the boil but Hitler was about to take Europe by storm and as the title suggests Victor Perez was swept up in the horror of war and sent to the most notorious Death Camp. This is his story.

Now the make up here is excellent and the period detail is wonderful. The dialogue is mostly in French  even the Germans speak mostly en Francais albeit one Officer with a deliciously dark German accent. The acting is all above average with some very moving scenes. However, this is far from being the brutal honest version of this dark part of history, but there is nothing wrong with that. This also shines a light on another victim to that dreadful war and as such this is one I can recommend.",1459468800,,1079,4.253658536585366
