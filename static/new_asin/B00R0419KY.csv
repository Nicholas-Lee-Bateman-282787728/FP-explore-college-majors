6891320,4,B00R0419KY,"Excellent biography. This PBS documentary presents the Russian president as a sinister tyrant. The film describes his shady past and portrays him as a ruthless thug presiding over a government that is corrupt and authoritarian. The more Putin bullies his neighbors, the more popular he seems to become in Russia. President Obama has called Russias aggression against Ukraine a threat to the world."" The filmmakers believe that Putin is a threat to the West, but they don't explain what he plans to do next.

The film traces Putins rise from unemployed KGB colonel to present-day Czar. In the 1990s, he proved himself a loyal lieutenant to powerful men, like Boris Yeltsin and the former Mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak. Yeltsin essentially created Putin, plucking him from obscurity in St. Petersburg and making him head of the security forces and then prime minister. Putin became Yeltsins chosen successor, but he was unknown to most Russians. He became a hero after several apartment buildings were allegedly bombed by Chechen terrorists in 1999. The film suggests that Putin and his friends in the intelligence services were behind the attacks. Putin used the crises and the subsequent war to raise his profile and pose as a patriotic defender of the country. Putin became president in 2000. The film notes that both Yeltsin and Putin refused to allow the bombings to be officially investigated.

Putin's is popular with the Russian people and has an approval rating of over 80%, This is mainly because he is seen as a leader who stands up for Russia. The Yeltsin years were viewed as disastrous, and democracy and capitalism did not bring the expected prosperity. Putin's nationalism plays well at home and Russians prefer to be feared rather than pitied.

The film implies that Putin behaves like a medieval monarch. Opponents are crushed and allies are protected and rewarded. The film examines his treatment of Russias richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent eight years in prison after challengong Putin. The murders in 2006 of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya and former intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, highlight the danger faced by anyone who gets in Putin's way. Sobchak's widow is one of the few people in the film to say anything nice about him. Putin is also shown to have ties with former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who seems to be on his payroll.

The film explains how Putin got rich and claims he is worth at least $40 billion. It also discusses the level of inequality in Russia, which has increased on Putin's watch. Karen Dawisha states that the median or the midpoint wealth for the average Russian is $871. This means half the population has more than that in wealth, and half the population has less. Median wealth in India, is over a thousand dollars. So the average Russian is poorer than the average Indian. Russia is the most unequal country in the world, with 35% of the total wealth owned by just 110 billionaires.

Russia has no real history of democracy and Putin is a throw-back to authoritarian Russian leaders of the past. Dawisha claims that instead of seeing Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, we should see it as an authoritarian system in the process of succeeding. The Russian don't seem to mind dictators as long as they appear patriotic. Stalin is still revered, even though he was one of history's great mass-murderers.

The main issue for us is whether Putin represents a threat to the West. The filmmakers interviewed Edward Lucas of The Economist who claims that we underestimate the danger that Putin poses. Lucas argues that Putin regards the West as decadent and gutless. He will keep trying to bully us as long as he can get away with it. Lucas believes that we need to start pushing back. However, the Western public has no interest in fighting wars over countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union.

The filmmakers claim that Putin intends to stay in power as long as possible because he suspects that his successors may try to throw him in prison. They believe that Putin reached a deal with Yeltsin so that all corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives would be dropped. The film implies that Putin is looking for a successor who will offer him a similar deal. A Putin biographer who now lives safely in Paris, compared him to a cornered rat. His natural response when cornered is to attack rather than talk, that is why he is such a dangerous adversary. This documentary explains Putin's past, but I would have liked to know more about his plans for the future.",1436313600,7,4600,4.882202304737516
6891321,5,B00R0419KY,"This is a superb documentary that follows the rise of Putin's power, criminal activities, abuse of power, abuse of official position, involvement in relation with organized crime, knowledge of money laundering and more. 110 individuals own 35% of the wealth of Russia. The median or midpoint wealth for the average Russian is $871 according to Credit Suisse a very neutral report, yet median wealth in India is $1000 which means that the average Russian is poorer than the average Indian.  These statistics put Russia as the most unequal country by far in the world.

The saddest part of the whole documentary was that the reporter never questioned Putin's spokesman any of the above information as well as the fact that no one except Putin can become president when he claimed """"United States supported de-Russification. If you are Russian, you can be killed. If you are Russian, your civic rights would not be protected... If you are Ukrainian, you will be in parliament, you will be a president, everything you want to be.  But if you are Russian, bomb, artillery and killings will be the answer. This is, we're sorry, we answer strongly no.""""

Putin has insured to change the Russia's constitution so he can stay in power till 2015 which most likely he will since he has the support of the average Russian and more. Infact Putin has over 80% approval so the only question for Putin will be HOW and WHEN before 2015 to take out his $100 plus billion dollar asset out of Russia so he can live in glory somewhere in EU, most likely in London where all those Russians are welcomed for their cash, just like all those proxies who are still alive and proudly expressed their opinions about the criminal acts of Putin in this documentary. Now those are the live ones since there are many dead ones especially in UK who could say more but somehow they all died for mysterious reasons. Putin is no Sadam, he is not going to hide in a hole for six months to get hanged after a hot shower and a meal, so let's hope Putin will be happy to settle to soak the sunshine anywhere even in some third world country when he has to go, otherwise he may resort to some spectacular fireworks not to anyone's liking. Putin's image on the cover tells you all you need to know. Hasta la vista baby.

8693459,4,B00R0419KY,"Shares the rise of Putin from an unemployed former spy who caught on as Deputy Mayor and eventually was associate with Boris. Since Boris was evidently corrupt he had to cover for him, but he was a face in the crowd. THEN, bombs go off in apartment buildings and it is DISCOVERED that it APPEARS the bombs were PLANTED by enemies! So, he sends troops in to attack!

Later investigations reveal another bomb that did not go off, it has military hardware. Well, people that do investigate DIE! Putin reconfigures things to stay in power and has it set up that he can RULE until 2024! Interviews with people in the know, people of Russia appear in near poverty, looks like a pathetic mess. One of the most interesting things to me was that they showed his motorcade.",1524528000,,763,4.528985507246377
8693460,5,B00R0419KY,"This is a very important video. Every American or anyone who cherishes freedom should see it. Putin is another STALIN, maybe worse. He is certainly the worst Russian leader in modern times. He should be banished to the trash heap of history. Not praised, as those poor Russians are forced to do. He is responsible for interfering on our presidential election and putting Donald Trump in the White House. It is time we do something about it.",1501459200,2,440,4.7272727272727275

8693463,5,B00R0419KY,"Another interesting assessment of a very rich Russian Leader. What is the difference between him or having a ZSAR. He has virtually made himself a permanent leader of RUSSIA. There is so much poverty within the Human landscape. I feel empathy for the RUSSIAN People BUT you can see whether it is COMMUNIST or DEMOCRATIC regime it does not really matter. It is only a few with all the money and in our Society the Middle Classes are disappearing at a rapid rate.
Again very interesting. I will be interested to see what happens to Putin post 2024 if he stays in  power that long and he will. BUT how will he explain his GREAT WEALTH to his Country later.",1486684800,2,653,4.441666666666666

8693465,5,B00R0419KY,"Excellent as far as it goes, badly needs to be updated.  Putin is surrounded by a ""rogues' gallery"" of yes-men and political hacks, quite venal, that he uses as mouthpieces for some of his most odious opinions and policies (K. Dolgov, others). To imply that these minor characters are are not ""Putin"" is naive and silly-- or worse, giving complicity to lies.",1472256000,2,358,4.774193548387097
