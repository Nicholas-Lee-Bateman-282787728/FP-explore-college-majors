8521014,3,B007Q7H620,"Sorry, I want the video of the 1912 NCAA Championship Game in New Orleans.  My Att technician removed it from my TV without my knowledge,  My late husband and I shared some powerful bonds for 52 yrs., but  one special bond was our love of UK basketball.  To lose this recording was heartbreaking.  I have searched every site I know, without luck.  If anyone who reads this can help,  I would be forever grateful.  Thanks.

Excellent DVD for the Kentucky Fan
was given as a Cheistmas present and enjoyed many times over and over again",1357862400,,145,4.615384615384615
8521017,3,B007Q7H620,"This DVD falls in line with most other ""Year in Review"" DVDs that I've bought over the years. Lots of video highlights but there isn't a whole lot of interview footage. Not a lot of in depth background story for the big games like the Louisville Kidd-Gilchrist display. This is a decent video but they could've done better.",1352160000,,323,4.586206896551724
8521018,1,B007Q7H620,"You would think a Championship special for a basketball obsessed fan base and program like Kentucky, would put together a stellar DVD. That is not even close to what this piece of garbage is. The editing is choppy and the narration is incorrect and all over the place. Its as if this was put together by an amateur high school media student. You would have the narrator saying one thing while something completely different was on the screen. Then the highly anticipated rematch with Indiana in the Sweet 16 is only given TWO PLAYS! A foul by Davis in the first half and a rebound in the final seconds of the game. Then the national title game gets maybe 3 plays worth of highlites and then it cuts to the team driving into Rupp Arena for the celebration and then abruptly ends.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Cross your fingers and hope CBS puts together an official DVD because this is absolutely a waste of money. There are better youtube videos out there of the 2012 Kentucky Basketball season.",1338249600,8,989,4.5251396648044695
8521019,2,B007Q7H620,"This video highlights the year but not very well and don't expect to see the final game. In fact the final game barely shows for more than a few seconds. It is hard to follow at times, they don't label but the most important games. The video jumps around a lot too. Not worth it unless you just have to have all things Kentucky. Sorry I wasted my money.",1338249600,5,353,4.130434782608695
8521020,1,B007Q7H620,"THIS DVD IS SO INCOMPLETE THAT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING....
THERE IS NOT COMMENTS ABOUT DAVIS SETTING RECORDS FOR BLOCKED SHOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN HE BROKE SHAQ'S RECORD FOR BLOCKED SHOTS.  NO COMMENTS ABOUT WHO IS GOING PRO.  NO COMMENTS ABOUT WHITE HOUSE VISIT.",1337731200,4,264,4.9772727272727275
