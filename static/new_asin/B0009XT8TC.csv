2334894,3,B0009XT8TC,"Colonel Bleep is even more primative than I remembered.  I was less that 7 when I watched these in the 1950's.  If your child demands sophistication in cartoons, skip this.  I loved its simplicity.  A caveman, a living wooden puppet, and a super science alien protector of our space sector, none of whom speak, make up the cast.  The narrator provides all the verbal info.  Give it to a small child whose sense of wonder is intact.  This is for someone who likes Fred Rogers.  It's sweet; it's simple, it's Spacey.  Bleep has a lab and a cool island where he and his sidekicks live and their adventures begin.  The characters and situations have signature sound effects that young kids will like.",1169251200,7,696,4.631147540983607
2334895,4,B0009XT8TC,"If you're interested in vintage animation from the 50's,you'll love this DVD. Really cool artwork. Know that this DVD was made from some scratchy, well worn prints but  I'm not complaining, just glad to have it available.",1136419200,7,221,4.972972972972973
2334896,4,B0009XT8TC,"""Colonel Bleep"" is said to be the first ever made for TV cartoon series to be made in color!  Boy, what vibrant, bright, loud color!  And what amazing art and design!  Clever plots, too.  ""Colonel Bleep"" is one of the very best cartoon series of the 1950s.  There is a LOT of influence here on the art and style of ""Ren & Stimpy"".  John K. and company were easily familiar with ""Colonel Bleep"" when making ""Ren & Stimpy"" and other cartoons.  No doubt about it.

I watched ""Colonel Bleep"" on TV (in black & white, of course) in the 1950s when I was not yet old enough to go to school.  I never forgot this cartoon!

The cartoons on this DVD have had little done digitally to clean up the picture and sound.  Well-used films were the source here, not original negatives, for certain.  Until something more definitive comes out, this DVD will be the one to have.",1136160000,14,859,4.367088607594937

8069812,4,B0009XT8TC,"There is a fairly clear political agenda that comes across in this show that was probably missed by most parents at the time. Whilst the presentation is patterned after the popular contemporary live-action sci-fi shows (Captain Video, Tom Corbett, Space Patrol & Rocky Jones), the messages delivered are largely unique. Individual episodes are an intriguing melee of social justice, no-nuke advocacy, peace-nik principles, fascinating scientific musings, and simple diatribes on how to be a good person.

Remarkable for its time (1957-58?), it is all done with a decidedly Trek-like liberal left-wing slant. Unfortunately, most of the history of this show has been sadly lost, including air-dates and production details. At least 35 episodes survive (about a third), with most of the original production footage going missing after a van being used for storage was stolen while the company was closing down. The production is primitive, but everything else is delectably enlightening.",1412121600,,984,5.516556291390729
8069813,3,B0009XT8TC,"Unfortunately the sound is off.  Not noticeable right away because there is no lip sync.  But once you notice, it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Still fantastic to look at but too bad the follow through wasn't there on such an important sound issue.",1401580800,2,249,4.488888888888889

8069815,5,B0009XT8TC,"A fascinating cartoon from the early days of television featuring an alien, a caveman and a kid-cowboy.  Very abstract and outre, it is  mind-blowing to watch.",1373932800,2,159,5.076923076923077
8069816,5,B0009XT8TC,"and this cartoon is even better than it was when I first watched it. Like the other reviewer, I would get up at five-thirty Saturday morning to watch Modern Farmer, then this show, then Dodo the Kid From Outer Space.

How can a cartoon with minimal animation and simplistic plots preserved on scratchy ""noisy"" film be better today? For two reasons. The obvious one is that I am reliving my childhood by watching this. The first episode on the DVD mentions magic books with pictures that move by themselves. At age six I thought that would be absolutely amazing and would be impossible to ever create. Of course now I can watch that very cartoon on a device that fits in my pocket.

The other reason is that I am nostalgic for the time in which this show was made. Everything is atomic-powered. The Futurans have devices that far exceed the capabilities of our own Earth devices. In The Future robots make streamlined stuff. Space travel is effortless for Colonel Bleep. All the buildings and things are streamlined and decorated with orbiting electrons. I love what we would now call the mid-century retro look of the whole show. Fifty years ago, in The Atomic Future of Tomorrow, everything would be Better and I would be living in it!

I should mention that the talent of the voice actor of the show, the only voice we hear, is amazing considering he has to perform virtually all of the show.

Other reviewers have mentioned how this show influenced the artist Shag and John Kricfalusi. Any fan of Shag's works and Ren and Stimpy will see it immediately.

Unfortunately only half of the show's 104 episodes have survived. I consider myself lucky to have seen this show fifty years ago, and am glad I bought this DVD. If you are my age or thereabouts (I'm fifty-five) you will be also.",1357776000,9,1786,4.621451104100946
