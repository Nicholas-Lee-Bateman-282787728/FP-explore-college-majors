5324213,4,B009FFHXEC,"It's definitely a good ab work out. If you are out of shape expect to work up a sweat. But overall, as long as you are dedicated you'll see results!",1359763200,8,148,3.966666666666667
5324214,4,B009FFHXEC,"This is a good workout to do on days that I need a break from circuit training.  I like that this DVD can be done with or without weights.

Even though it is relatively easy, I wish it had a separate warm up and cool down.

Other than that, I have no complaints!",1359504000,5,262,3.9056603773584904
5324215,5,B009FFHXEC,Great work out!,1439078400,,15,4.333333333333333

5324219,3,B009FFHXEC,not what I thought.,1410652800,,19,4.0
5324220,5,B009FFHXEC,My wife loves the show and seeing all the people that were in each season doing the exercises is fun. She says they are some really good work outs.,1410480000,,147,4.103448275862069
5324221,2,B009FFHXEC,"Not my favorite DVD workout out there.  The workouts are short, but I didn't feel like it did much.",1409097600,,99,4.2105263157894735
5324222,5,B009FFHXEC,"Best workout DVD.  The short workouts packed high with  before intensity gives just enough for the time I have before going to work in the mornings.  Because the workouts are short with high intensity, I am able to do these every day and 2-3 times per day most days.  I absolutely love it.",1401408000,,289,4.39622641509434
5324223,4,B009FFHXEC,I love these two guys. The Cardio Abs portion kicks my butt! The All Out Abs portion didn't feel all out to me and seemed very short. But in all I really like this video. I could listen to Bob talk all day.,1401148800,,206,3.813953488372093
5324224,1,B009FFHXEC,"This is such a slow boring drawn out dvd!!!!  It's not intense in the least and the workouts are short.  It's lacking in background music and seriously lacking in motivation!!!  I really like Dulvet on the show and feel bad insulting him but wow he's like working out to a turtle!!!!!!!  He's SO quiet and low key, there is no tempo in it at all.  And the contestants are constantly off track with each other, it's awful!!!!!",1398988800,,425,4.467532467532467
5324225,5,B009FFHXEC,Great ab workout if you need to change up your routine. Works your abs from all angles. Good to throw this video if you want to focus on your abs.,1397347200,,146,3.9
5324226,5,B009FFHXEC,Great DVD for any fitness level! I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a great workout for toning,1397260800,,115,4.8
5324227,5,B009FFHXEC,"very good work out, I could feel the burn the next day still, will definitely use again and recommend to friends.",1395532800,,113,4.428571428571429
5324228,5,B009FFHXEC,"WOW! the core is one of the hardest areas to get back into shape, after loosing 83 pounds my mid section still is week and flabby. I know it is going to take time to get it tightened back up. there are 4 work outs to choose from and they do work. I am able to feel the muscles beginning to tighten back up after just 3 weeks of working out 4 times a week. this is great, quick, rather easy but effective if you listen and do what Dolvet is saying to do. I highly recommend this for those who have little time to work out but want great results",1393286400,8,543,3.900900900900901
5324229,5,B009FFHXEC,"This video is tough, but doable.  I feel great, like all the Bob Harper videos.  I recommend it!  It took a few times through doing all the exercises, but it's great when you make it!",1388707200,2,183,4.171428571428572
5324230,5,B009FFHXEC,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778
5324231,4,B009FFHXEC,"This is a great workout video. I love how it works your abs along with everything else. The only thing I don't like is that it is the same workout everyday till you goto the next level, then the same thing.",1385078400,,206,4.048780487804878
5324232,5,B009FFHXEC,This is the best workout video I have done in a long time.  I have all the videos and this one puts me to the challenge.  Great for all levels of cardio.  I would recommend this for anyone that wants to burn calories.,1381968000,2,217,4.0
5324233,5,B009FFHXEC,The video was exactly what I wanted and needed to jump start my 2013 body makeover...fast delivery...inexpensive! Thanks Again! y,1379462400,,129,5.5
5324234,1,B009FFHXEC,"Looks like a home video, the intructors are not energized...... We are not using those videos anymore.... much much better insanity training or hip hop abs.",1374796800,,156,5.038461538461538
5324235,5,B009FFHXEC,Dolvett and Bob are very motivating and encouraging. I do this workout about once every two weeks between other DVDs and I have noticed better ab definition.,1373155200,2,157,4.851851851851852
5324236,5,B009FFHXEC,"This is a workout DVD that really put me through the paces! Ab workouts are definitely something that I am always looking for as I get older, and this one did not disappoint. I do have to say that the first few times I did it, I was in a bit of pain afterward due to using muscle groups that I do not always use, but after that it started to get better and I started to see more definition (which is what I was hoping for). I am now using this along with a few other programs and it is a nice way to mix it up and bring in a workout that will challenge you and get you ready for the next phase in your workout routine.

5324237,5,B009FFHXEC,My husband and I workout regularly - but are not gym people.  We bought several DVDs so we could change up our workouts as recommended.  This is a great DVD - very challenging.  We prefer Bob's instruction - but that's a personal preference.  There are a lot of plank exercises in this DVD - you will sweat and feel like you've accomplished something at the end.  The best thing about these videos - they remind you that you don't have to be perfect - it's ok to stop for a moment - then come back to it.  Never give up!,1367020800,9,520,4.15
5324238,5,B009FFHXEC,I have only done a couple of the sessions on this DVD but it is awesome for a beginner or someone that has some physical issues (arthritis).  Being able to pick out of four workouts or do as many as you want helps when you don't have a lot of time on certain days.,1365120000,3,264,3.888888888888889
5324239,4,B009FFHXEC,"I love the 3 different ab workouts- when done all together, it really blasts your abs! I recommend it- one of the better BL workout DVDs!",1364774400,9,137,4.3076923076923075
5324240,2,B009FFHXEC,I love biggest loser workouts but this was disappointing.  They said to pair it with another workout that would be the only way to get a hard workout to put it with another workout.,1364515200,,181,4.323529411764706
5324241,4,B009FFHXEC,You can choose and customize your workout with the better results.  Your can also improve your metabolisim and your heart.,1363478400,,122,5.1
5324242,5,B009FFHXEC,"I love all Biggest Loser exercise DVD's. Just another one to add to my vast collection.  Love the show, love to workout with them too!",1361923200,,134,4.36
5324243,5,B009FFHXEC,"IF YOU WANT TO START WORKING ON YOUR ABS, I SUGGEST INVESTING IN THIS , THIS ONE GAVE A GOOD WORKOUT , JUST KEEP DOING IT ALONG WITH YOUR REGULAR EXERCISE OR WORKOUT, BUT THIS WILL DEFINETLY TARGET YOUR ABDOMEN. I LOVE IT.",1361318400,2,222,4.186046511627907
5324244,5,B009FFHXEC,Talk about sweating! I feel like I'm gonna die after that workout! Does a body very good! Excellent buy! Recommended to all!,1360022400,2,124,4.681818181818182
8540978,5,B009FFHXEC,we do a 10 minute workout every morning and at least feel like we are doing something.,1516579200,,86,4.117647058823529
8540979,5,B009FFHXEC,Easy to follow. Instructors are very encouraging and easy on the eyes.,1472860800,,70,4.916666666666667
8540980,2,B009FFHXEC,The workout was pretty easy and didn't challenge my abs as much as I would have liked. I would have liked something more intense and something that mixed in a little more cardio. I would suggest 6 Week 6 Pack by Jillian Michelle's. That one was intense and challenging. I liked it much better than this one. I thought this was a let down for the Biggest Loser series.,1471824000,,367,4.333333333333333
8540981,3,B009FFHXEC,Beginning was too easy then it jumped into way to difficult for me with very little in between.,1467936000,,95,4.333333333333333
8540982,4,B009FFHXEC,"Admittedly, I got this DVD to start working out. I have yet to use it, but I have previously used the Biggest Loser workouts and have LOVED them! Looking forward to getting motivated and get started using this one!",1465603200,,214,4.512820512820513

8540986,3,B009FFHXEC,"Pretty good. Compared to some others, not quite up to par. This is a great workout video if you are starting to get into shape or reintroduce core fitness to your days. It takes a couple workouts in one session to feel the full burn but there are some good stretches in it. It's also very confusing because many of the people don't look particularly in shape but for some reason they are able to do some of the most intense exercises without blinking.. which makes you feel good at first if you feel like you look better, then rips your pride out for not being as good.",1448582400,,569,4.277777777777778
