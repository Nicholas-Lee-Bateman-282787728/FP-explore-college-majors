1270315,5,B00003CXP9,"Let me say at the outset that in many instances this can be VERY disturbing to watch, especially for Americans given the history of the races here. And Spike, (GOD I love him)still continues to work you. You tend to watch this as you would a horrible accident....you simply cannot turn away but it is entirely too painful to watch. I understand exactly what he was trying to say and agree wholeheartedly.  Yet I cannot deny I was squirming in the beginning because it takes a bit of getting used to.

First and foremost, forget critics. Your opinion is just as valid. This is another very important film with wonderful performances. While Damon's interpretation is a bit over the top, there is no doubt what perspective he was trying to convey. He is a very troubled black man who has issues. His boss, who ""has a black wife and half-white children"" is repugnant, and thinks that this gives him the right to say and think anything about African-Americans he likes which is utter nonsense.

Jada Pinkett Smith is wonderful as the conscience after-the-fact and you wish to see her in more controlled, intelligent, roles as this.

But the standout, to be sure, is Savion Glover whose dancing is quite simply mesmerizing; it is quite easy to forget the rough ground we are treading and just revel in this man's talent. He also was the film's choreographer and the precision of his dance routines tended to help one endure these presentations in a cotton field with black actors in blackface.

Paul Mooney who plays Delacroix's father is positively wonderful and his comic routines are hilarious as well as insightful. He has  always been a cutting edge comic but sadly has not received his just due.

But just as he did in ""Four Little Girls"" Spike MAKES YOU CONFRONT IT WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT!!! I am quite satisfied with this DVD; it is a must for any DVD collection. The only complaint I have is that some (as a matter of fact, all) of the deleted scenes should have been rethought because they tended to flesh out the plot a bit more. The ending may have been a bit too violent as a possible consequence to the network's insensitivity but overall, this is a very complicated, mulit-layered, film that will demand certainly more than one viewing. Besides, I have already made up my mind that everything Spike has/will do will be well worth the controversy he invariably provokes. Hats off again, Spike!!!",987638400,2,2407,4.68957345971564
1270316,4,B00003CXP9,"Bamboozled was the type of movie that really makes you think.  It touches on content of racial sterotyping in such a profound way that the viewer of the movie is almost left breathless.  The movie is about an African-American tv executive named Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans).  Delacroix is asked by his boss to come up with a concept for a hot new urban comedy.  After Delacroix turns to his associate (Jada Pinkett-Smith) they come up with the idea of using two homeless street performers in the show (Savioin Glover and Tommy Davidson).  The show is to be called ""Mantan The New Millennium Minstrel Show""--and the preformers are to wear blackface, preform their show on a watermelon patch on a plantation, and revisit the comedy of the minstrel shows of the past.  Delacroix hopes this stint of racist comedy will get him fired--his plan backfires horribly when people of all races start wearing blackface and referring to themselves in deragatory slang terms.
This movie is potent, poignant, and powerful.  It moves you to think about both things in the past and the future.  Bamboozled can make you laugh at one part and then be moved to tears at another.  I definately call Bamboozled a must see movie.  Quite simply--the script is powerful, the acting is superb, the direction of the movie is fantastic, and the social message of the movie is definately worth hearing.",987638400,2,1376,4.866952789699571
1270317,4,B00003CXP9,"This film makes one think about many different things.  It is not Spike Lee's best film, but it certainly worth a look.  The movie was well done, with many fine comic moments as well as dramatic ones.  It is a bit uneven, but that shouldn't keep you from watching a film that deals with racial issues in such a way.",987552000,2,315,4.216666666666667
1270318,5,B00003CXP9,"Detractors have pointed to the exaggerated caricatures to show how unrealistic this whole plot is.  But that is exactly the point that Mr. Lee wants to make.
When strikingly similar complaints were directed toward a very different, but as important film about race - Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, the director, Stanley Kramer replied that the exaggeration was necessary to make an utterly convincing and unequivocal point.  The Sidney Poiter character HAD to be made the ideal husband-to-be, however unrealistic it might have been for that era, in order to isolate race as the ONLY factor that needed to be confronted. Spike Lee does the same here.  He isolates race as the issue here, in this case, the continual mistrelization of African Americans in the media.  He adds two commercials to the tv show that really drive home the point:  One satirizes Tommy Hilfiger, and the other, malt liquor ads.  Both glorify hip hop culture and the ghetto life.
After I saw this movie, thought about how plausible this scenario is, an offensive minstrel show that clearly degrades African Americans.  It didn't take long to find examples in real life that come very close to the movie.  Take a look at the highly successful, ""Wassup?"" ad campaign.  Look at the programming for UPN.
Mr. Lee also touches upon many other facets of the racial problem in America.  The title character, poignantly portrayed by Damon Wayans - someone who was responsible for a fairly recent resurgance of demand for this type of entertainment- is a Harvard graduate, thus representing not only a long line of Black intellectuals from W.E.B. du Bois to today, but also represents the relative ineffectiveness of that approach to combat racism as opposed to grass roots efforts.  Other aspects of this is touched upon like the opposing factions that have developed in the African American community, and most importantly, this film openly acknowledges that some of the blame must be placed on the very people who stands to be victimized by this problem.  Mr. Lee absolves no one, including himself, and spreads the responsibility out to everyone, thus culminating in one of the most important works on contemporary race relations.",986256000,2,2196,5.019283746556474
1270319,1,B00003CXP9,"It was fun, but Spike Lee can't direct his way out of a paperbag. He ses his camera less than ever before. Spike Lee sits it down, as the actors act the scene out in different angles, and he edits it together. But it gets boring after awhile because it's just like sitting in a room listening to a conversation. Nothing fun about it. However Spike Lee had some good ideas and put them to use, a couple of scenes turned out to be really funny, but of course it was typical Spike Lee, a white man pretending to be black, was married to a black woman, a black guy who pretended to be French, and a group of gangster rappers who appeared throught out the film, but I'm still  not quite sure of theirpurpose. ...I have respect for the film for 2 reasons, first of all I always respect independent films, but that's still no excuse, also it was shot on Digital Video which interests me because alot of film-makers still use film and its not often you see a film at the theater done in Digital Video, however Spike Lee seems to be new to the idea of digital video because his cinematography was [poor] and it was lit very poorly, very faded, not in an 8mm fasion but in a home video fasion.  Lee also needs to learn where to stick certain scenes. I like the idea of the Black face make-up, but there's a scene right after the Black Face show gets started that Damon Wayans is in a radio booth talking about how controversey it is, however up to this point we've heard nothing of the controversey and it lost me for a minute. After this scene I saw people protesting outside of the studio. It would have made more sense to show the protesting THAN the radio interview.",985132800,10,1660,4.2834394904458595

Excellent portrayal of stereo typing Afro-Americans.  Don't look for a ride-off-into-the-sunset ending as there is not one in this movie just as there is not one in today's America.  You will either love this film or you will hate it.  Either way, you will come face-to-face with your own prejudices.

1270689,5,B00003CXP9,"It isn't surprising that this film generated such a mixed reaction: it is shocking, witty, painfully and brutally honest and speaks the truth on so many levels at the same time that it becomes very hard to say what it conveys because it conveys so much. Spike Lee gives us a history lesson on the minstrel tradition, on how blackface paint is made, and on all of the ""toys"" made to look like grotesque and infantile versions of black folks, and he shows us how white America has always had an obsession with ""fetishizing"" black folks; all of the posters and African art in the television producer's office reveal that he sees black people as objects that he can display, manipulate, imitate (in his ghetto speech) and degrade all at the same time.

The dancing and the music were fantastic; Mos Def is on board and I loved recognizing The Roots performing as the porch monkeys. This film is an extraordinary exercise in critical thinking, and I feel pretty sure that this film constituted a big chunk of what inspired Dave Chappelle to go on and make his comedy program: a continuation of the Black art form of satirizing racism and the obsession with controlling and demeaning black culture and black people.",1415491200,,1209,4.702830188679245

Watch this alongside ""The Confederate States of America"" for a clue as to why our nation and its conservative media get their knickers in such a bundle about our president.  There is so much this film has to say about American culture that it would be appropriate for a whole college course.  The misfiring of a minstrel show on television says more about our bone-deep prejudice than anything you can imagine, and the film's ending (no spoiler here) will shock you.  Spike Lee produced this, big surprise, and the Wayans have their fingers right on the pulse of American bigotry.  Show this to your children and try to explain our history of exploitation --  and then listen to what they have to say.  You might be very surprised at their responses.
This film will grab you by the head and not let you go for a very long time.  And then ask yourselves just what it is we're afraid of.",1412294400,,931,4.435294117647059

Yes, reviving a black minstrel show is a monsterously great idea for satire; this could have been an epic moment for Spike Lee to use racist materials in order to destroy them with class, confidence and wickedly funny smarts.  But no, Spike's only expression is angst and reverse racism, rolled up in a bunch of ""safe"" hammy melodrama and self-consciousness. It's not funny at all, and very boring. Worse, it all looks very amateurish, like Lee's a film student without the ability to pull all his ideas together.  The film never finds a consistant tone and the end is just laughably bad.

1270932,5,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee may be arrogant.  And he might be wrong about some of the things he wants to say--such as interracial relationships are necessarily about having a ""jungle fever.""  But in this film, he is brilliant.

This movie is, I would say, made to accompany Frantz Fanon's book _Black Skin White Masks_.  In both, the issue of how an oppressed people is made to perceive their own bodies according to the logic of oppression is the central issue.  Furthermore, in the movie, some of the characters are reading Fanon's other major work, _The Wretched of the Earth._

Perhaps the reviewers who panned this movie have not read much on the philosophy or sociology of race.  Perhaps they assume that movie characters all have to enact or address a set of industry-wide standards.  I don't know.

What I know is that, as Fanon advocates in his work, this movie attempts a kind of psychoanalytic destruction of racist stereotypes.  What I wonder is whether or not Spike Lee has in fact done as much as Fanon.

Fanon offers hope in his book.  And he points out a kind of existential-phenomenological way of living in the world: as a perpetual questioning, as a never-finished task of dealing authentically with a facticity.  Does Spike Lee end with this or with hopelessness?  If the latter, then I wonder, ultimately, whether his brilliance can withstand the criticisms of those who are simply threatened by him.",1271376000,,1403,4.815899581589958

I thought it best to write my review similar to how Ive been thinking about the movie since seeing it a few days ago, choosing to write it as a stream of consciousness.

What is funny? What is comedy? What is satire? What is solidarity and Is it really possible for the black race to achieve this anymore? Was t.v.'s ""the Jefferson's"" derogatory to the black race? Were shows such as ""In living color"" a modern minstrel show? Why does no other race in America have as nearly as many issues with interracial and intra-racial image perception? What kind of meaning will the ""N"" word have in 10, 20, 30 years from now? Is this not greatest film dealing with race ever made? Would the public tolerate a minstrel show, if they were African American performers, today? Why not? Can white America ever atone for it institution of slavery? Will they even try? Can African Americans ever fully recover and be whole despite the psychological damage that slavery has caused, in this country?

In short, this is one of those very few movies I wish I would have written.",1266364800,,1181,4.592417061611374

1271085,1,B00003CXP9,"I saw this film in the theater when it came out, and sat in disgust and bewilderment at it.  Recently, IFC showed it, and all those bad feelings came back.  This is an awful film, possibly Spike Lee's worst ""joint"" (a stupid gimmick that he really should drop at this point), a real insult to people of ALL races.  It's a ponderous, self important, heavy handed ""satire"" about corporate America, America itself, television, and the glorification of black stereotypes.  It has awful performances, especially by Damon Wayans (who is a great comedic actor), who talks with an overblown, obvious fake accent.  He's the TV network programmer who comes up with the idea of a modern day minstrel show for a programme.  Michael Rappaport, another good actor, plays his boss, a clueless, cliched ""ignorant white person who runs the corporation"" here.  In fact, most actors in this film are playing ""types"", not actual characters.  The whole concept that the current day public would accept, a black TV programmer would propose, and a white executive would accept a minstrel show as a hit is preposterous.  It's also deeply insulting to people of intelligence everywhere.  Spike somehow thinks we're still in the days of D.W. Griffith, and blacks are being portrayed as ignorant and lazy, and all they want are watermelon and white women.  This is so false.  Now, one will argue that it's a satiric film, but it is not satiric.  It is ugly, offensive to white and blacks, it is not funny, it's preachy.  And the film itself looks awful.  For some reason, Spike shot this on digital video, and it looks crummy, dark, and cheap.  This is a really bad film from a filmmaker who has shown brilliance, but who also goes for cheap publicity (his recent dustup with Clint Eastwood is a great example of massive overreach), and makes some really misguided films.  Bamboozled is an awful work, one of the worst films I've ever seen.",1233792000,6,1913,4.801223241590214

1271087,4,B00003CXP9,"Angry, uneven, brilliant. . .  This is not destined to be remembered as a great motion picture, but it sure is powerful.  How do you even write about it?  Spike Lee shoves everyone around, overturns tables, and leaves you to think about it all.

Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is a ""negro"" TV writer who is black enough to be upset about lack of representation of people of color in his business, but ""white"" enought to not understand fully the ramifications of what he does.  His boss, Mr. Dunwitty (Michael Rappaport) is a white guy who thinks he's tuned into the black experience.  Pierre decides, in protest, to revive an old time blackface minstrel show for modern television thinking that by sabatoging the TV programming he'll prove a point.  The station goes for the idea.  Pierre's conscience, personified by assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith), protests.

And the public - enough of them at least - love the show.

What follows is a protracted (too long in my opinion), painful examination of historical racial stereotypes made modern.  Savion Glover (the little kid from ""Tap"") and Tommy Davidson were so wonderful and sad as the minstrel show's blackfaced principals, ""Mantan"" and ""Sleep 'n Eat.""  The first time the duo apply their blackface, it's revulsion toward the show itself.  The second time, it's themselves they hate.  Tommy's painful ""it's showtime!"" in the mirror to himself is a suffering for the sins of all people who would participate in such a spectacle.

For me, less would have been more with this film.  Spike Lee disagrees and takes this show to the point that - in my opinion - the message gets muddied by excesses and moral high ground suffers in angry paroxysms, but it's his film and his anger.

But Lee is vindicated in the theme of the show and the general message that all of us can share in the racial difficulties in which we find ourselves and many of us are sheep.",1210982400,,1918,4.763636363636364
1271088,5,B00003CXP9,"This is not your typical Spike Lee film, but perhaps his most important -- so important that the film is void of the director's ego for the most part.  This film speaks about race issues in America, the unique issue of descendants of slavery fitting in to the culture that enslaved them, loving the hope that the country holds, yet not being given permission to hold residual pain and residual anger.  It's a film about how the cultural norm creates and defines human beings who are other than the defining majority through objectification. It's a film about the stunning power of image and the media, especially when its creations are forwarded as politically neutral.  Nothing I can write would be clearer than Lee's own words:

""The pain comes from looking at the images. How people of color in this case specifically African-Americans have been portrayed since the inception of film and also with radio with the Amos and Andy which was on film, radio, and television. Also we have to look at the way we portray black collectibles, when you see the dolls and the toothpaste and all the other things. You know, we're viewed as less than human, sub-human, and that stuff is painful. . . . There are certain things in this film where you want to laugh but at the same time you don't want to laugh because it's not funny. And it's . . . it's a very interesting phenomenon that happens in this film."" --Spike Lee

""In doing the research [for the film] what hurt me was the depth that I saw. The hatred of us as a people. We saw the songs, when I see Bugs Bunny in blackface. I mean . . . I love Bugs Bunny. I had never seen him in blackface before. And Warner Brothers buried that, you know. And we wanted to include it in the film but they wouldn't let us. Bugs Bunny is an institution so they said hell no. But to see the depths to which America showed its hatred via radio, film, television, songs, Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben. You know, Niggerhead Cornflakes, whatever you want to . . . you know. It's just amazing."" -- Spike Lee",1206662400,2,2026,4.435483870967742

The problem here is Lee has a tendency to preach and pontificate.  His main protagonists, Wayons(where did that accent come from?) and Jada Pinkett seem to be berating the audience.  What this flick needs is a little bit of the world-weary rectitude of Max Shumacher(William Holden) from ""Network"".  Lee's righteous indignation is best expressed here in a short bit by Man Tan (Savion Glover) who does it through dance movements and not a cacaphony of empty verbiage.  Aside from Glover the best part of Lee's film is a montage of racist vignettes from vintage Hollywood.  Maybe Lee would have been better off making a documentary than this misfire.  Lee to me has always been an infuriating filmmaker and I don't mean controversial.  On occasion he's made some very good films(""Do the Right Thing"", ""Malcolm X"", ""Clockers"") that fall short of greatness because he doesn't emotionally distance himself from the material.

1271199,5,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee's Bamboozled owes a lot to Paddy Chayefsky's story Network (1976), which owes a lot to writer Budd Schulberg's A Face in the Crowd (1957). All three movies are about TV personalities who become the personification of social or political movements.

In Bamboozled, Spike Lee makes his debt to Network explicit by having a black TV announcer tell his TV audience to go to their windows, open them, and shout to the world that they're ""not going to take it any more,"" just as Peter Finch's Edward R. Murrow-type news anchor did in Network. Then the star of the TV show in Bamboozled collapses, like the news anchor.

In Bamboozled, the black dancer who stars in The New Millennium Minstrel Show loses his identity and becomes a stereotype. The network changes his name from Manray (an artist, like Man Ray?) to Mantan (after Mantan Moreland, the bulgy-eyed comic in old movies).

When Network first came out, everything it predicted was outrageous, but it's all reality (or reality TV) now. TV news departments are no longer subsidized by entertainment divisions - - news departments ARE entertainment divisions, or more precisely, news IS entertainment. Sibyl the Soothsayer in Network has become John Edward, crossing over between the spirit world and a country that finds superstition more comforting than science. (We're desperate not to be Left Behind.)

In an interview in Cineaste magazine (vol. XXVI, no. 2, 2001), Spike Lee tells why he dedicated Bamboozled to Budd Schulberg, the writer of A Face in the Crowd, the movie that made Andy Griffith a star.

Andy Griffith is like John Wayne. He only played one character on film and TV - - himself - - and Griffith's Lonesome Rhodes in A Face in the Crowd is like Wayne's Ethan Edwards in The Searchers. The cruelty in Ethan Edwards and Lonesome Rhodes is also there in every other character the two actors ever played, but we didn't want to see it. And after his success in A Face in the Crowd, Griffith never again dared showed the kind of contempt that Sheriff Andy Taylor must have had for the citizens of Mayberry. Giving us a glimpse of the monster is one thing, but Griffith knew America couldn't stand to see him every week. Exasperation with with Barney was as bad as it got.

So we got the phony Mayberry smile - - a kind of whiteface, another mask.

That issue of Cineaste is worth tracking down for articles on the reaction to Bamboozled and for Spike Lee's interview. Lee talks about what he calls the ""magical n****r"" in movies, ""magical Negroes who appear out of nowhere"" and use their powers ""for the benefit of the white stars of the movies."" Films like The Green Mile, The Family Man, and The Legend of Bagger Vance.

Now we're all tuned in to the Network and it's picked out A Face in the Crowd for us.

Everybody likes him when they meet him (God knows why, since he's such an obvious bully to people around him). He used to drink too much and got into some trouble, but he's turned his life around and, with the support of friends with money, he's become a national leader. The people who warn he's a fascist are just left-wingers ""out of the mainstream"" who hate America anyway.

Forget the Matrix, the United States has become Network. No definite article is needed to describe the all-embracing global corporate entity that is the military-industrial-entertainment complex. (Ned Beatty tries to explain this epiphany to Peter Finch at the end of the movie Network.)

And the United States is on its way to becoming the minstrel show Spike Lee shows in Bamboozled.

In Bamboozled, white people, Hispanics, and blacks all wear blackface to be in the audience and all answer yes to the question, ""Is you a n****r?"" Maybe the non-blacks are just ""appropriating"" a culture they have no right to, but it might be a good thing for people to realize they all have something in common.

Everybody's being bamboozled.",1119139200,23,3894,4.734121122599705
1271200,5,B00003CXP9,"Pierre Delacroix is an angry television screenwriter whose ""safe"" black sitcoms a-la the Huckstables have not fared well on the ""idiot box.""  His self-loathing (masterfully portrayed by Damon Wayans with a faux-Haitian upper class accent) is barely concealed as he conflicts with his hip, ""ghit-to"" white wannabe-black boss producer.  As a last ditch, he concocts ""Mantan"", a live TV minstrel show in blackface and set in a watermelon patch, so racist and over-the-top Delacroix is confident it will get him fired.  (A TV announcer cheerfully intones as jaws thunk to the floor... ""Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat!  A couple 'o Reaaaaal Coons!"")

It is as if Byalistock in the ""Producers"" had decided to set ""Springtime for Hitler"" in Auschwitz with Jewish inmates as performers.  To Delacroix's horror, ""Mantan"" is a hit.  It also drives Delacroix, and those around him, stark raving mad.

""Bamboozled"" was Spike Lee's most audacious take on racism in media, and unlike the now iconic ""Do the Right Thing"", Hollywood's glitterati did not know what to make of it, and the movie fizzled at the box office and with mainstream critics.  Lee is unstinting in his thesis that the history of black culture is punctuated by exploitation and co-optation.  His sledgehammer lands not just on the black performers who line up to perform in the retrogressive ""Mantan"" (including the extraordinary dancer Savion Glover), but the pseudo-revolutionary Mau-Maus who deaden any hope of real change consuming 64 oz chuggers of malt liquor sold by white multinationals.  Spike Lee speaks through the advertisements slipped in the film as cultural commentary as well as one of the main characters, Slone, who like Delacroix ""has bloody hands"" in the creation of ""Mantan.""

At its heart, ""Bamboozled"" is an old-fashioned morality tale, a descent into hell which is not comedy but rather tragedy spiked by satire (a term carefully defined for us by Delacroix).  Halfway through the film, anyone who still thinks ""Bamboozled"" is funny needs a stiff reading of Baldwin or Aptheker as a wake-up call.  Spike Lee, like an old testament god, wreaks vengeance on the wicked, dispensing lessons along the way (note, for instance, how when the Mau Maus get their comeuppance, only the white wanna-be is spared by the LAPD).  Were it not for the language and rather explicit sexual references, this would be a useful film for U.S. History or race relation classes.

This is one of those rare films that bears repeated viewing and thinking about.  It is more complex than ""Do The Right Thing"", since ""Bamboozled"" is a film about film, and as such is asking the viewer to test his or her reaction to what is in the screen.  When we see, at the end, the montage of scenes including the young Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney putting on blackface, do we say that is racist, or excused as genuine culture?  And what will we say about today?",1116115200,4,2895,4.944214876033058
1271201,4,B00003CXP9,"I finally saw this film recently after reading an editorial that mentioned this film in regards to how the racial stereotypes perpetuated in Minstrel shows continue this day in any rap video you see. This film is a much needed eye opener, a satire with a deeper message. The use of satire is often necessary to bring to people's attention the underlying truth that most cannot accept at face value. This film perfectly draws out on our society's racism and race relations.

A few years ago, I remember coming across an advertisement for a Minstrel show that my church congregation put on in the 1950s. Considering that there are few African American members of my church to begin with, it was a complete shock to me who these nice elderly people could do such a thing. With ""Bamboozled"", Spike concludes the film with an excellent montage of images from movies, TV shows, cartoons that all featured the worst stereotypes of African Americans as bug-eyed, big lipped, ants-in-pants, cannibalistic animals, who sang and dance, shucked and jived, all kinds of terrible traits. These images were taken from Shirley Temple movies and films with Bing Crosby, Mickey Rooney, and Judy Garland. It was an eye opener. Even Warner Brothers cartoons of my recent youth (1970s) contained racist images in the guise of Bugs Bunny in some of his antics.

I've been meaning to watch all of Spike Lee's films someday, as I like the statements he tries to make in his films. He has amassed an interesting body of work, though some were more successful than others. For me, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Do The Right Thing"" are his best works, and this one would be third, ahead of ""Jungle Fever"". I loved the performance of Michael Rapaport as the cool talking head honcho of CNS Television, who has an expressive way with words and sounds more ""black"" than the faux intellectual nerdiness of Damon Wayans, who plays Pierre Delacroix, which we learn in the film is a pretentious name he gives himself to distance himself from an embarrassing past. I also liked Jada Pinkett Smith in this film, as Delacroix's assistant who doesn't agree with the direction he's taking with his show idea.

The premise is that Delacroix can't quit his job, so he comes up with a plan to make the most racist show he can imagine that will cause CNS to fire him. He proposed a new Minstrel Show for the New Millennium, featuring two African American street performers (the excellent Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover) in black face make up. Rapaport's Mr. Dunwitty loves the idea and claims that the show would be even bigger than ""Friends"". They shoot the pilot show to an unsuspecting audience who don't know if its okay to laugh. Tommy Davidson plays ""Sleep n Eat"" and Savion Glover plays Mantan, the tap dancing idiot. Their variety show features schtick anyone who has ever seen ""Hee Haw"" would be familiar with...lame brain one liners, idiot people, and exaggerated stereotypes.

The satire is that the studio execs love the show and pick up 12 episodes, and when it airs on TV, it becomes an instant smash show. Soon audiences are showing up each week in black face and proclaiming their pride in being ""n------"", even though nearly all of them are white. The film is so over the top, poking fun at our double standards (how many claim not to be racist because they listen to rap or watch basketball). The truth is...we expect African Americans to entertain us (in music and sports), but beyond that, we don't take them seriously as people. True, the hip hop community is quite influential in the language and style of our advertising and pop culture, but how many African American CEOs and Mayors and Governors and Senators are there? In the financial matters of our country, we still impose a glass ceiling on anyone not part of the white male demographic...so what is our minstrel show of today? Spike Lee made a point in the commentary track that you don't have to wear black face to have a minstrel show. It goes on without people being aware of it. For that reason, I'm grateful he made this film. Just seeing the disgusting collectibles from the past century (such as the ""jolly n----- bank"" or the Aunt Jemima dolls) is a reminder of our racist past. We mustn't forget even as we move on to greater inclusion and burying old stereotypes, allowing people to be who they are regardless of race.

I want to give this film 5 stars, but because the film veers into a strange tangent for about 10 minutes near the end of the film, I simply thought Spike Lee got lazy with how he wanted to end this film. It was a cheap and lazy way to go, even though he explains his reason on the commentary track. I disagree, because if done right, his ending would have punched up the meaning of this film. I'm at least glad that the montage at the end saved this film on a somewhat redeeming note. If anything, this film serves as a reminder of our recent history and how overt racism really was. The film succeeds as an awakening to the forms into which the Minstrel Show of the last century has morphed into something a little bit different, but accomplishing the same devastating effect. I know I'll never be able to look at another rap video in the same way again. Thank you Spike Lee!",1115078400,53,5233,4.634698275862069
1271311,4,B00003CXP9,"As a homage to such Hollywood movie classics as ""A Face In The Crowd"", the original version of ""The Producers"" and ""Network"", I understand completely what message Spike Lee conveyed in this film, and for the most part, I agree with it. He brings up the uncomfortable subject of negative images of blacks in television, past and present, and just how the media seeks to capitalize on it. The film centers on the uptight, upwardly-mobile Damon Wayans character, Pierre Delacroix (aka Peerless Dothan), who is a successful black television executive that has completely lost touch with his roots. After being berated by his boss and being threatened being fired if he fails to come up with a hit TV show, on purpose, he creates an outrageously offensive and stereotypical TV minstrel show with actors, dancers and musicians all in blackface as a joke, in order to break his contract with the network he works for - all of this so he won't have to worry about being sued if he quits. The show is supposed to initially mock the negative images of blacks, and to make people angry enough to have it pulled from the air, and get Pierre fired - but to his surprize, it turns out to be a massive hit.

Pierre is at first perplexed at this but then revels in the fact that this was something that was his creation - and having a moralistic viewpoint doesn't seem to matter much any more. After receiving all types of accolades, success eventually goes to his head. From then on, Pierre totally sells out and doesn't seem to have any remorse about exploiting the sad history of blacks in America. In fact, he thinks it's rather amusing...he basically puts out the message that we need to ""get over"" these things, these images, and take a humorous look at them, and move on. (Imagine telling the Jews to ""get over"" the Holocaust, take a humorous look at it and move on. I guess someone tried to do that years ago - remember the TV show ""Hogan's Heroes""? Still didn't make the Holocaust or concentration camps very funny to Jews.) Pierre's getting paid and all is good in his world...until he gets a wake up call later in the film.

Back in the day, ""Amos and Andy"", Stepin Fetchit, Buckwheat, and racist films like D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" perpetuated American blacks in the worst possible way. In fact, the last few minutes of the film shows clips from these films and these characters, and this is powerful in itself. Those images have been permanently burned into the minds of people all over the world, and we are still feeling the effects today. There are folks in the world whose only view of the behaviors and images of black people come through what they see in the media, and what they see does NOT represent black folk as a whole!

One of many points that Spike is making in ""Bamboozled"" is that the negative imagery of those characters are not just limited to those performers of yesteryear, but it has carried over to this generation as well -- specifically, some of those entertainers in today's hip-hop community, who are nothing more than modern-day minstrel performers because they are perpetuating blacks in their most negative light, and unfortunately this is what sells -- this is what is marketable. Look at almost any hip-hop video on BET and you will see a modern-day minstrel show...all that's missing are the performers in blackface. The psuedo-revolutionary, wannabe Public Enemy-like ""Maus-Maus"" in the film represent that demographic. In addition to saying we all love watermelon and fried chicken and we are an oversexed race who loves to sing and dance, and we are all slow-witted and lazy - now to add to these stereotypes are that we are all obsessed with crime, substance abuse and material things. Worse of all is that a lot of these performers don't even realize how detrimental the images are. Those who do are a lot like the Pierre character: they simply don't care. It's all about making a buck to them. The actors from back in the day didn't have a choice about the roles they were regulated to in the movies - but today, actors, singers, rappers AND yes, producers and directors, DO have a choice as to the kind of images they put out there for the world to see, and unfortunately, a lot of them make the wrong decision.

I enjoyed all the actors' performances. Damon as Pierre was okay, but I could have done without him trying TOO hard to sound like a man who is obviously educated --  or someone who ""talks white"", as some would say. Jada Pinkett Smith is more down to earth and is a welcome counterbalance to Damon's role - however, I had a hard time trying to figure out whether or not she was on Pierre's side until about three-quarters of the way through the film. Savion Glover and Tommy Davidson (in a surprisingly good dramatic role) are equally convincing in their roles as the blackface-wearing stars of Pierre's show. In the beginning, the two formally homeless street entertainers are thrilled to finally have someone take notice of their talents. Towards the end of the film, however, they wake up and smell the coffee and begin to realize the negativity of what they are doing. Michael Rapaport's character as Thomas Dunwitty, the head honcho at the network that Pierre works for is REALLY annoying, but it's a role that is amazingly effective. He's the so-called cool white guy who is thinks he is ""down"" with the black community because he has a black wife, and feels he can say anything about blacks and get a ""ghetto pass"", but he reveals himself to be just as racist as any member of the KKK. Paul Mooney was excellent in his all-too-short role as Pierre's father. Cameo appearances include Matthew Modine, Mira Sorvino, Johnny Cochran, Rev. Al Sharpton and the late Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes, from the successful '90s trio, TLC.

""Bamboozled"" was an excellent title, because just about EVERYONE in this movie is fooled into thinking this show is one thing, when in reality, it's something else. I feel that Spike Lee can still make relevant films about race, and this film certainly is one of them. But it seemed to me that he really did not know how to wrap up the movie, and it starts to unravel during the last half hour or so, so that's why I docked it one star. For me, ""Bamboozled"" could be called one of Spike's greatest films if it weren't for how it ended. But overall, I respect him for taking on a subject like this. Yes, it's harsh, over the top, and right in your face. But it's not racist. It's reality, and I guess that what makes so many people uncomfortable. Well done, Spike!!

Sidenote: Another film on this very same topic is ""Dancing In September"" - definitely a must-see if you like ""Bamboozled"".",1102204800,8,6674,4.631756756756757
1271312,5,B00003CXP9,"I have recently decided to finally expose myself to the work of Spike Lee, putting his entire body of work at the top of my DVD rental list, and Bamboozled was the first one to arrive.  I must say that I can not wait for the rest of them to come in.  The only negative aspect of this film is something that several others have pointed out...the voice of Damon Wayans' character.  Through the film it did begin to grate on me as I heard it, seeming too forced and unreal.  However, Wayans did a solid job of portraying a man who, having made a horrible mistake of judgement, slips into denial and ends up rationalizing the error to himself until he believes he actually did the right thing.  The supporting cast was also very strong, Savion Glover is a very talented tap dancer, and Tommy Davidson shows that he is more than just a comedic actor.  Michael Rappaport pulled off what was a very dangerous role, as it is so easy to play the role of a white man trying to be black and turn it into a cliche of ignorance.  Instead, he was very believable and very tasteless and rude, a flawless performance.

As for Spike Lee?  I thoroughly enjoyed his direction.  The graininess and edginess of the quality of the cinematography is a beautiful character of his work.  It has a distinct style that can be identified as his work immediately.  He wrote a very powerful story, showing several sides of the struggle of the black man trying to be successful in this day and age.  Sometimes, it seems that the only way to succeed is to sell out in one way or another.  In the end, the deaths are metaphorical, symbolizing the cultural death of those who sell out, that they are eventually ostracized from both the white and the black sides of society.  The story is a Shakespeare-style tragedy, rife with internal conflicts, a main character with a fatal flaw, and an ending with permanent finality.  There really is not a hero, nor is there a villian, as none of the characters are one-dimensional.  Their conflicts are never black and white, no pun intended.  They are complex problems created from the characters' choices and their circumstances.  It is easy to see how their mistakes are made.  We can believe that we would not have made the same choices if we were in their position, but that is easy to say from the outside looking in.

In this film, Lee told the tale of several real and human characters, presenting a struggle that he sees every day.  He withheld judgement of these people, and did not force his opinion on the viewer, allowing the viewer to decide who was right and who was wrong.  I look forward to seeing the rest of his work.",1100908800,33,2642,4.481171548117155
1271313,5,B00003CXP9,"This film has stuck with me like few have. By having the guts to be over-the-top offensive - this movie plays like a parable a la Orwell's Animal Farm - Spike Lee peels back the veneer of civility and manners that stifle America's conversation on race. What we find inside is a minstrel show that forces us to ask ourselves: Do I enjoy this? Am I a racist if I do? In the end, we're no longer sure if the media merely exploited ugly images of black people or, in the end, created the images themselves.

Fantastic performances by Jada Pinkett Smith (the film's only ""normal"" person and, thus, the audience's proxy), Damon Wayans, Michael Rappaport, Mos Def and others. And I was wowed by Lee's use of HD digital tape instead of film -it gives the movie a coarse, gritty feel that becomes a character unto itself without distracting from the story.",1095811200,4,847,4.5359477124183005
1271314,2,B00003CXP9,"As with every Spike Lee film--with the exception of the classic ""Do The Right Thing""--""Bamboozled"" shows signs of genius, but is fatally flawed by glaring splotches of amatuerish directoral decisions.

 In ""X"" it was the ridiculous insertion of an MGM-like, choreographed dance routine; in ""Bamboozled"" it is the unbelievably forced vocal styling of Damon Wayans. He doesn't sound ""white,"" which is I guess what Lee was looking for--he sounds like a poorly programmed robot, kind of like Teddy Ruxpin trying to imitate Boris Karloff. It's ridiculous, totally distracting, and it throws into the viewers face from start to finish that they are Watching A Movie. It is impossible to ignore it.

 Which is a shame, because otherwise ""Bamboozled"" would have been a very good, if not great, movie. Thanks to a great actor and a great subject, Lee was still able to turn ""X"" into a fantastic movie, despite the stupid dance scene. ""Bamboozled"" doesn't have that kind of impact, and the never-ending robotron dialogue kills it for me.",1091404800,4,1027,5.059171597633136
1271315,5,B00003CXP9,"""Bamboozled"" is Spike Lee's best work to date. This independent spirit of the cinema has done it again. Once thought to be the young black Woody Allen of the cinema, he has secured his place in history as the Frederick Douglass of film, calling for the emancipation of the chitlin' circuit into the world of fully recognized human beings. It depicts the struggles of black performers to be considered whole human beings and not just chattle property for white moguls to buy, sell, and trade on the open market of Black showbiz minstrel flesh. It also illustrates the sub-human status attributed to black people in post-reconstruction America. The reality of this film is very depressing indeed but, it is non-the-less absolutely compelling...This movie is a must see historical document for movie fans of evey persuasion!!!",1091059200,,823,5.103703703703704
1271316,5,B00003CXP9,"This is the movie that got me turned on to Mr Lee.  When I rented this movie just a few years ago I watched it 3 times and then watched it with the audio commentary.  I found the movie *that* interesting.  Also, the movie has a few layers to its plot so each time one watches it, they're sure to pick up on something new.
The characters are also great - I especially love Damon Wayan's boss who is a caucasian married to a black woman and tells Damon ""I'm more black than you are""  From that point on, you know this movie is going to put a lot of stuff in your face.
The basic premise - Damon's character is tired of the types of shows with black people that show on tv nowadays.  It's all very stereotypical (think this summer's ""Method and Red"" on fox) and he wants to do something creative.  His boss wants something along the lines of ""homeboys in outer space"".  Damon's character is so incensed that he decides he'll get fired in order to break his contract.
What could be better for getting him fired than to make the most racist and ignorant show on tv?  He decides to make a show called ""Bamboozled"" which will recreate the blackface shows of the 30s and 40s only it will be black actors putting on blackface.  There's only one problem with his plan:  the show becomes a hit.
The rest of the movie shows what happens to the rest of the characters in the style of a Shakesperean tragedy.  In other words, a few things don't quite go according to plan and everyone suffers.  (ie Romeo & Juliet, MacBeth, etc)
Another thing that makes this movie so awesome is the fictitious commercial spot during the show Bamboozled.  Spike Lee takes a pot shot at Tommy Hilfigger's alleged marketing directed at blacks with another brand whose name I can't write or my review will be banned.  You'll be shocked, but in a revealing sort of way.",1087430400,5,1834,4.371681415929204

People can argue if he is a racist or not, but on this film he showed how corporate America market their products to black inner city people.  I for one used to work in a marketing department at a large corporation and this type of behavior went on all the time. So many times, I had to smile and walk away when I heard ""you people"" and ""those people like stuff like that"". What is worst is some black artists (namely rappers) help build on these negative stereotypes. They are NO different from the black actors of the 30s who was paid to demean their race. Instead of black people getting mad at Spike for making these films, I suggest you take your anger out on the real culprits and their marketing schemes. BTW, these culprits come in ALL RACES.",1085788800,5,796,4.342281879194631

I am glad that I am not the only one who knows Spike Lee is a racist.  And a slick one at that.  He does these movies and black people go see them (I am black, so don't attack me).  Do The Right Thing was horrible, Jungle Fever (he ought to be ashamed) all in the name of ""eye-opening"" filmmaking.  Give me a break
Bamboozled...I don't know what to say about this movie. Stereotypes, senseless violence, just downright shameful.  There was no message here...except that, we, as black people, sometimes do it to ourselves (ex. Soul Plane? same problem). And helping this man, for the sake of a paycheck is deplorable.

1271319,4,B00003CXP9,"_Bamboozled_, quite simply, achieves what it sets out to achieve.  As I watched this film, I was made very uncomfortable (in fact, this point cannot be stressed enough).  Spike Lee puts everything on the line, constructing a show around a desperate television writer who, in an attempt to lose his job, suggests that the network bring back a minstrel show.  Unfortunately, the network and white America are all too ready to enjoy the stereotypes fed to them and the show becomes a huge success.  The true shocker of the film is the realization that we are not far removed from the minstrel show (or, arguably, not removed at all).  The most powerful sequence in the film for me is the section near the end where Lee has compiled a host of film and television sequences of African Americans ""blacking up.""  This sequence, set to music, evokes emotions of sadness and disgust concerning racism like few films have before.
This film is a great statement and provides a different type of argumentation.  If you can't argue with the ideas of racism by promoting positive images, go for the realm of satire and shove the racism in our faces.  By doing so, our own ideas and images become absurd and much more-they become sickening.  One cannot watch this film with an attentive mind and not feel sickened by the end of it.  I can only fault it on a few points.  First, the film feels far too long and loses steam in the middle.  Fortunately, the ending of the film is quite gripping and brings it back on track.  Secondly, I was not particularly impressed with Wayans's performance and would have liked to have seen a stronger actor in the role.  Savion Glover, on the other hand, is quite good and his dancing is explosive and dynamic-truly the greatest tap dancer living today.
That being said, _Bamboozled_ is a film that will leave an impact on your imagination and deliver a lesson in U.S. history that will carry you forward into the present.",1084579200,2,1942,4.656891495601173
1271320,5,B00003CXP9,I will not elaborate too much.  This film had great camera work. I am a fan of hand held filming because its a lost art form.  It is a very imortant movie to watch.  I notice the negative feedbacks but I feel that is only a product of the shock and emotion that this movie provokes.  Perhaps its the guilt of finding pleasure in the popular forms of black entertainment today that Spike Lee is so strongly against. So i will stress again please do see  this film it is one of Spike Lee's better films.,1076025600,,501,4.177083333333333
1271489,4,B00003CXP9,"I can best describe this movie as befitting a genre that starts out funny, but gradually becomes very intense, violent, and disturbing (a la Full Metal Jacket).  Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) cracked me up from the very beginning with his [false], overenunciated ""Dr. Evil"" accent -- I almost expected him to ask for ""one MEEELION dollars"" when pitching his idea for his new New Millenium Minstrel show.  There are, of course, many stereotypes in this movie not limited to the characters on the show, but also including Delacroix as the white-black guy and his boss as the black-white guy who tells Delacroix that he ""knows your people better than you do"".  The main characters of the Minstrel Show, Mantan and Sleep-n-Eat, are brilliant.  Mantan is a talented tap-dancer and steals the show with his ""educated feets"".  The jokes are hilarious because the show is so bizarre and parodies ideas that are so outdated for our time.  The show is a big hit among blacks and whites alike and initially all seems like good, clean, albeit politically incorrect, humor.  That is, until we realize that Delacroix, Mantan, and Sleep-n-Eat have sold out for personal profit and will pay the ultimate price for doing so.  The tone of the conclusion of this movie is sad as it plays a montage of racially offensive clips from old movies and cartoons, reminding us of how harmful and hurtful these sorts of stereotypes really are.  Although the subject matter is interesting, it is unclear exactly why Spike Lee chose to make a movie about it.  Images of offensive toys and antiques are revived throughout scenes in Delacroix's office and the ending credits.  Although these sorts of objects, along with the above-mentioned clips from old movies and TV shows, haven't been commonly seen in decades, Lee apparently felt that they still pose a threat to the perception of African-Americans, even in today's society.",1052352000,6,1900,4.962145110410095

Spike Lee's not too subtle here, he's going for the throat.  As we all know, Lee likes to tackle racism most of the time, and this time he's got his sights on TV land.  Michael Rappaport is hysterical in this.  I find it hard to believe that a goofball like that would be in charge of a television station, but it's not a big deal.  I do agree with the reviewers that say Damon Wayans' accent is silly.  It's fake sounding and unnecessary.  I'll admit it is funny at times.  Also, I seriously doubt in this day and age a show like Mantan would ever get made or greenlighted, maybe only in an In Living Color skit.  But, that's the point;  This film is about excess, it's satirical and overblown on purpose.  It starts out as a comedy, and by the end of the film gets very messed up and disturbing.

While Pierre Delacroix started out with one frame of mind, by the end of the movie he had completely ""sold out"".  Unfortunately, shows like ""Girlfriend"" and ""The Parkers"" carry on the minstrelsy type drivel that passes for Black entertainment.  I'm just as guilty as everyone else though, because sometimes I find myself watching these stereotype-laden shows.
Spike is a genius.  One day he will get his just desserts.  I'm a big fan, and look forward to the next thought provoking film from one of the greatest directors of all times.

1271493,5,B00003CXP9,"I grabbed Bamboozled off of the video store shelf after passing it several times. After viewing it I was nearly in tears. What I saw in this highly provoctive satire, is nearly every segment of the Black community being portrayed. There is Damon Wayans, a Black television write/producer who is not comfortable in his own skin. He hates his Blackness and makes great efforts to seperate himself from what he sees as negative aspects of his color. In one scene Damon's character is unable to reconize Willie Mays' picture. Then there is Jada's character. A Black woman, highly efficient, highly professional but not taken seriously. She struggles to reconcile what she faces each day to her deeply rooted sense of what is right. There are the street characters,(Savion Glover and Tommy Davidson) struggling and wanting success so badly that they can justify even putting on black face to make money. The Mau Mau's blinded by their own pain and rage. Attempting to cope by getting high and access verbage, not able to recognize the absurdity of their actions and sayings. In the midst of all of this is the white owned media, in this case CNS (personified by Michael Rapaport). It is uncaring, its only concern is beating the competition for ratings.
This is a film that is disturbing, but I find that truth is often disturbing. This film will disturb both blacks and whites. It disturbed the hell out of me, because I saw parts of myself in this movie, and that is always disturbing. I do feel that Spike was a bit heavy handed with his characters in the ending, but that's Spike. I love this movie. Would I recommend it, yes. That is most emphatically yes. But view it with an open mind. This is not a feel good movie, this is not a self affirming movie. This is a brutally frank movie and I am sure Spike has and will continue to catch a lot of flack for it. What I find really amazing is that Spike is so brutally to the point in this movie but he still makes you laugh.
This movie shows us how the media has Bamboozled us, not only Blacks, but all Americans. It shows how the media can shape our opinions and modify our sense of what is right and what is wrong. How the corporations exploit our weaknesses and insecurities. The acting is brilliant, one of Damon's most powerful performances.
If you want a mindless film, then this one is not for you. If you want a feel good movie which hypes our system and reaffirms our way of doing things, pass this one up. But if you want a brutally frank statment of media exploitation and of its power to persuade, then this is a film for you.

This movie is something that all Americans as well as the world should witness first hand. Spike Lee delivers a cold and chilling message to mainstream America (Black & White) that reflects the perceptions of African Americans in entertainment. Spike indicates that even though minstrel shows are no longer visible through mass media, The same identical traits and stereotypes exist today. Basically Lee projects to the audience that a majority of present day Black entertainment is nothing more than one conglomeration of a minstrel show. He displays that in many instances, African American television shows may have Caucasian writers, producers, and directers, who in many cases are completely oblivious to the African American experience or struggle. This is one of the most intriguing satires ever concepted, at least in my opinion. This movie should be appraised for what it conveys. If you have an open-mind and are actually able to perceive this movie for what it trully represents you would in turn understand what is facilitated.

But this is quite possibly the first movie that properly addresses the whoredom and the selling out of our people.  Bamboozled is a movie that I found very hard to watch, and it shook me up at the ending.  In truth, Plenty of our things in ""African American"" (A term that even causes confusion) culture are derivative and not even remotely based on being African.  Drug Dealing, Gang Banging, Platinum and Gold Chains, Fancy Cars, Popular Hip Hop (You know, the kind that makes money).  That is all ""sell out"" material in my honest opinion.  Yet, we have many ignorant blacks (there is a word for that that they even call each other) that identify these clearly worldly, malevolent, violent, and even dumb tendencies as being black, while labeling being educated and well mannered as being white.  Being a black who has never really tried to fit in, I understand the pressure that blacks face when trying to ""keep it real"".  In order for African Americans to evolve, we have to put down the way that white oppression has caused us to think.  No Offense to Whites, but most view our booty bopping hip hop culture as a joke and see thru our religious leaders.  And an Angry Educated Black Man or a TRULY educated Black Man is ostracized, even in his own community.  This post is not meant to be racist nor inflammatory but to state the plain and simple truth.  Most Blacks are viewed as lazy, frivilous, and unimportant welfare cases unless we can run a 4.3 40 yard dash or dunk a basketball.  Spike Lee has made a movie that ALL blacks need to watch and comprehend.  In closing, I have a simple question.  Would Soul Train be on network TV if it were a strictly caucasean show?  Some will disagree with me but Spike Drives Home a Very Valid Observation.  Delacroix is the Educated Black who I kind of sympathize for mostly but he knows what he is doing and he rejects the ""black"" way of living.  Damon Wayans and his accent (Kinda like I talk) is viewed as sounding white.  But he enunciates every word and is proud to be a black man who has made it.  Later in the movie, He makes the fatal mistake of making a show so distasteful that the autointoxicated American community wounds up enjoying the show.  He is so far removed from the black community that he does not see the beauty and realness of it.  Jada Pinkett Smith is strong in this movie as the witting but unwilling participant.  She makes the fatal mistake of following the money while rejecting her own brother's cause (This is rampant in our communites) DISLOYALTY to your own family. Savion Glover and Tommy Davidson show  human side to the buffoonery.  They are well meaning and poor, but their mistake is thinking that material wealth will provide spiritual wealth and that they will not remain puppets of the system that they are in. Mos Def is good also but he is Hateful and Angry in the Movie.  Spike Lee understands that Hatred is not the way to fight ignorance.  Education and Love are the way.",1029369600,8,3502,4.564102564102564

1271600,1,B00003CXP9,"This movie is to film making as short buses are to grade schools, full of people who, as special as they are, you wouldn't trust to run with scissors.
The editing and cinematography alone make this unwatchable.  The filming was reminiscent of an episode of cops meets America's funniest home videos.  We all remember how funny those are, right?  The ubiquitous, entirely unnecessary, background music forces me to assume that the audio track was simply an NWA tape looped over, and over, and over again.
The character development, oh sorry, I was thinking of a different movie.  Characters in this movie are all one dimensional and thoughtless, though lightly peppered with random and pointless outbursts.  Daman Wayans was particularly disappointing because he has shown such talent in most of his other movies.  Instead, he spends most of Bamboozled struggling to make the best of a poorly written role in a poorly written film.
Spike Lee has attempted to tackle heavy topics such as racism and discrimination by making a boring film that is better left unwatched.  It's would be redeeming factor is that it is filled with overdone, but extremely underdeveloped, satire.  A concept that could have been wrought perfectly in a ten minute short was painfully stretched out into a pointless, seemingly endless film.  Leaving us with the poignant, though wonderfully unrelated, concept that cops take pains to kill only black people, which, true as it may be, added nothing to the plot (which was about the entertainment industry).
One would be better off watching actual blackface films, such as Bing Crosby's A White Christmas.  These films were not made to be satyrical, but their seriousness reveals far more about racism and discrimination than Bamboozled could ever hope.",1016323200,3,1775,5.110726643598616
1271601,3,B00003CXP9,"Maybe one day America's most interesting African American director will recapture the same resonance that Do The Right Thing left with audiences. ...
Why the mess-ups? He has shown time and time again that he is mature (you would have to be to tackle the complex subject of racism), and few directors are as experienced as he is, but being so passionate about communicating his opinion he resorts to getting a sledgehammer to ram his message down our throat instead of relying on the audience to decide for their self.
Bamboozled haunts the mind. Racism is as prominent in the world today as it was fifty years ago, it is just more discreet...
Unfortunately Bamboozled runs with the label of satire so strongly that Michael Rapaport's character ended up being sheer nonsense, a direct send up of all 'bad, greedy' producers. It's all too simple for me, and the agenda's are black and white, which is far from the truth. Where was the politics? It's not just about ratings and merchandising...
Damon Wayans leads the film and is a capable actor who can entertain but Lee should never have allowed Wayans to speak his lines with that terrible accent. It is like a mixture of Ivy League geek (I am aware the character he plays comes from Harvard), stuffed nose and all devoid of bass. It is terrible and ruins some of the best dialogue of the year. Couldn't he have just used his normal voice? If I'm missing something here then someone please tell me.
Jada Pinkett, although continuing to show little or no variation in her acting roles, remained strong throughout the film, although her final scene was pointless, yet not the fault of her own.
The tap dancing was excellent, and Lee's ability to take people from their profession and turn them into an actor (a la the basketball player in He Got Game) is impressive. One of the film's lines 'Any black man can be an entertainer,' rings a certain truth...
The ending is muddled though. People die for no reason, and goodness knows why Lee resorted to rubbing out characters that in a sense shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Mos Def embodies the definition of deadpan acting, or maybe it was just his uninteresting, poorly written lines.
There is certainly a sense of deja vu when the two lead dancers break away from each other, like Washington and Snipes in Mo Better Blues. Can't black people enjoy success without being unbearable? Spike seems to think not.
Easily the most recognisable feature of all of Lee's joints is the aesthetic style. He is a master of capturing urban atmosphere and the surprising choice in digital cameras is in fact great, and no doubt saved him a lot of money.
I loved the joke on behalf of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s acceptance speech for the Academy Award ('Show me the money,' never seemed so demeaning to the African American race).
Recent films such as American History X and Black and White have failed to effectively detail the issue of race and racism. It's a shame, but someone someday will make a good film (it could even be Lee himself), and it will not only make you think 'racism, 'isn't it bad' but actually make you recognise it's ever more stealth in today's media environment.
There is one scene that makes me want to watch this film again though and that is where we spend five minutes looking at a history of black representation in Hollywood movies over the past fifty years. It truly haunts you and is an important piece of film to see.

1271602,3,B00003CXP9,"I'm confused.  And if you get ""Bamboozled"", you will be, too.  And that's a good thing.
Bamboozled is basically a movie that attacks, with dead-on accuracy, the media and its constant drive to turn African-American's into baffoons.  It shows, in depth, the character assassinations that take place behind closed doors in television stations across the country.  And particularly highlighted, are the advertisers who ""pimp"" members of the Black race to sell their product even as they degrade and destroy them.  For example, Tommy Hillfinger, who has publicly stated his distaste for people of color and his distress that his clothing are primarily bought by Blacks, is parodied in this film with such horrible accuracy that it FORCES you to think.  And that seems to be the key to MOST of this film.
Sadly, as many of Spike Lee's films do, it crumbles at the end.  The ending of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the overall premise, the plot, the build up nor the character assignments.  You will wonder throughout the film what the character Julian (Big Black Africa) is going to do and what his group of militants are truly about.  Are they rappers?  Militants?  Actors?  What?  Well, the answers will not be given at the end and you will still be wondering why they were made a part of this movie in the first place.  Probably to justify the grotesque ending, but realistically, we didn't need to get to know them at all for that.
Anyhoo, big props to Jada Pinkett-Smith and Damon Wayans for wonderful performances.  And particularly to Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover, without whom I don't think this film would have been half as good.  Overall, this was a wonderful movie that forces you to think about the treatment of the African-American in the media, the corporate world and in life period.  And I recommend it mainly for the first 1 hour and 45 minutes of the 2 hour 9 minute film.  But I can only give it 3 stars because of the misdirected ending which completely blows the strong buildup.",1015372800,2,2012,4.732758620689655
1271603,4,B00003CXP9,"The top three spike lee films (as of this date) are ""Do the Right Thing""-incendiary, troubling, powerful.  malcolm x- more a tribute to denzel washington's great performance rather than spike lee's script, but spike was the one who hired denzel, so he gets some credit too.  and she's gotta have it, spike uses his comic talent to its fullest in his debut film.  the first and the third films were greatly helped by lee's performances: he is a talented comic actor.
bamboozled is not up to the level of those three films, mostly because of its second half which is overlong and preachy and dramatically unfulfilling.  but up until damon wayans goes to visit his father ""junebug"", the film had an A potential, so it ends up with a B.
a few scenes I'd like to mention were particularly effective. jada pinkett telling her brother that she will not call him big black africa rather than julian and him telling her that it's easy enough to pronounce was a very funny, even heartwarming interchange between the house negro and the field negro.  these are two siblings of different pigments and facial characterisitics on opposite sides of a cultural and economic divide and there is a love between them.
savion glover's talent as a tap dancer certainly gave the movie an artistic heft it could not have had without him.  tap dancing as shown by gregory hines and his brother in coppola's cotton club can be a poweful means of expression of frustration, anger and defiance.  Despite this it is a mode of entertainment that immediately brings to mind a truckload of american history of a very painful quality.  the movie is not contradicted by spike lee's own experience with stereotyping and buffoonery but it is rather enriched by his history and indeed his mixed feelings towards it, (even one of the mau mau's has to confess that that stuff makes him laugh.)
in fact included in the audition was one very funny pimp who sang of beating and kicking his ho'.  as i laughed i felt uncomfortable.  not only because i fell out of my chair, but because stereotypes are a devilish business.  they make us uncomfortable and laugh and teach us how complex our prejudices and preconceptions really are.",1010016000,3,2189,4.734210526315789
1271604,3,B00003CXP9,"When I first heard about BAMBOOZLED, it sounded a lot like ""The Message,"" Spike Lee's first 16mm film while a student at New York University (NYU). The latter was about a black man hired to write the $50 million remake of D.W. Griffith's racist masterpiece, THE BIRTH OF A NATION. The film allegedly angered members of the faculty so much, that Spike Lee was almost kicked out of the film school.
Now twenty years later, Spike Lee slings a few more arrows at the media with BAMBOOZLED. Not having seen ""The Message,"" I'll refrain from comment on that film. However with BAMBOOZLED, Spike Lee has a lot of provocative ideas, but like so many of his films, he doesn't always know quite what to do with them.
The first problem comes in the form of Damon Wayans's character, Pierre De La Croix. Probably the most talented of the Wayans clan, in this film, Damon gives a very stilted performance. He's a complete caricature of a so called ""bourgeois negro,"" utilizing a clipped delivery that gets very irritating after a while.
Almost as annoying, but in a different way, is Jada Pinkett Smith's character as De La Croix's assistant. She's very shrill like so many women in Spike Lee's films. Also her character is very inconsistant. For example, when De La Croix pitches his minstrel show to his boss, she acts like she's never heard of it before.
The film is essentially a one-dimensional diatribe against racism in television. However, he hints at a few issues, which if developed would have made the film more intriguing and more richly textured. For example, when the minstrel show tapes its first episode, after the initial shock of seeing the leads in blackface, the studio audience (both black and white) eats it up. This hints at a very important point: black people are at least partially responsible for the cartoonish images that they see on television. The sad fact is that many black people would rather see a show like ""Martin"" or ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" than say, something like the short-lived drama, ""City of Angels."" Spike really blew it on this point.
Savion Glover and Tommy Davidson do a credible job in their respective roles, but each have gaps in their character's respective arcs. In other words, major changes occur with their characters, seemingly from out of nowhere. This is really a shame, because one gets the feeling that one or both of them could have given Oscar-level performances in the film. This is particularly true of Tommy Davidson, who seems perfectly cast in his role.
On a technical note, the shot-on-video piece looks very cheap and murky. While this may very well have been a creative choice, it comes across as more a cost-saving measure than anything else. More and more pieces released in the theatre have been shot on video, but not as grainy and grimy as this one. Like the film's story, the film's look is just as obvious in its presentation.
Of course, Spike Lee's body of work is easy to attack, but you've got to give him credit for his bold choices. Few filmmakers (black or white) are willing to take risks like him. For that alone, Spike is to commended. However, like many of his films, he's got some good ideas, but doesn't develop them fully. It's as if, he expects the viewing audience to simply ""fill in the gaps.""
After seeing DANCING IN SEPTEMBER by Reggie Rock Bythewood (who wrote the Lee-directed GET ON THE BUS), one wished that they had worked together on one project about the television business, instead of doing two separate films. The best scenario would probably have been Spike Lee as a producer and Bythewood as a writer/director (like Bythewood's wife Gina did with Lee on LOVE & BASKETBALL). Of the two films, Bythewood seemed to have a better handle on the general subject matter. Perhaps even a three way collaboration between Lee, Bythewood and Sidney Lumet (who did NETWORK, one of the best films about television to date) would have been great. Of course, I'm dreaming now.
In short, BAMBOOZLED has a lot of interesting ideas, but essentially preaches to the converted. While the film has some worthwhile elements, NETWORK and even, DANCING IN SEPTEMBER represent more effective examples of the genre. I'd recommend that you see one or both of them before you see BAMBOOZLED.
A final note: Given their obvious similarity, it would have been nice to also get ""The Message"" included with the DVD. Kasi Lemons's short ""Dr. Hugo"" was included with EVE'S BAYOU, so why not ""The Message"" with BAMBOOZLED?",1008547200,5,4477,4.785529715762274

This movie is VERY relevant to current times and definetly makes you re-think of who and what you find funny and why. Also accurately compares these minstel shows to mainstream popular rap music with ignorant rappers posing w/ 40 ounces in one hand, and half naked girls in the other arm.

In response to the person who brought up urban legends and the myth that has perpetuated everyone's email account, I think you missed the whole symbol of using Tommy Hilfiger in Spike Lee's movie.
We (meaning everyone) have a lot of work to do in the current state of race relations. This movie is a catalyst for some who have been blinded by the superficialities of society.
Granted there are many who believe that Hilfiger and Clairborne made these statements, however, Hilnigger represents the collective of fashionable clothes worn by young blacks. It is by no means a way of defaming Tommy Hilfigger. Because there are many blacks who buy his clothes as sort of a status symbol, Hilfigger was the easiest target. Many of us are blinded by the glamour of today's superficial society.
From the reviews posted, I see that most people enjoyed the movie despite the harshness of the topic, however, this movie has gotten andprobably will not get the recogition it deserves. I hope the entire world can learn from this movie.",1003968000,4,1048,4.860335195530726
1271758,3,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee throws another controversial curveball to the audience, this time attacking the media for the unflattering portrayal of Black Americans. Damon Wayans stars as Pierre Delacoix, a well-educated TV exec who introduces the idea of creating a satirical modern-day minstrel show to his white jerk-of-a-boss, Michael Rappaport (who is the head of a fictitious prime-time network). Mind you this is introduced after Rappaport rejects Delacoix's earlier pitch for a TV show about an affluent minority family because it would be too boring. Delacoix is stunned when his boss agrees to put ""Man-Tan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show"" on air, and is more surprised that this farce is a ratings winner and a critical success.
But let's face it; most of the story is just not plausible. Like network TV execs would literally put a modern-day minstrel show on air. Even more unbelievable is that TV critics would actually praise this show as a satire; there's a difference between acknowledging political incorrectness and plain stupidity as humor. As for the Man-Tan sketches, they're pretty long and so uninteresting that they drag the film down. I find it hard to believe that a studio audience could sit through those repetitive Man-Tan sketches and still find it hysterical (even with the Applause signal on). It's just not logical in this day and age. TV viewers may have their personal prejudices but no one can be THAT stupid (or racist) enough to sit in an audience wearing blackface, hooting and howling like they were on ""The Jerry Springer"" show. America's taste isn't that offensive.
I also have mixed feelings about the casting. On one hand Jada Pinkett-Smith (who plays Delacoix's unhappy assistant with a conscience-ironic for TV execs), and the gifted Savion Glover (who plays Man-Tan) each gave wonderful performances. Michael Rappaport was convincing with his ""blacker than most blacks"" image (a dig at white rappers), but then his portrayal got too over-the-top and annoying. Damon Wayans' acting as a corporate ""oreo"" was too awful to take him seriously even in his darker moments; he seemed more of a caricature. Tommy Davidson's role as Savion's sidekick in the minstrel show, unable to morally deal with wearing blackface, was also good but too short. The inept Mau-Maus, who could make the Black Panthers run for cover, were a nice touch and a very interesting social commentary on misguided race rioters who have little thought on their actions.
Some of the more subtle jokes are very funny, such as Delacoix's dream sequence where he's very hysterical and gives up the award he won to presenter Matthew Modine at a televised ceremony, a dig at Ving Rhames and Cuba Gooding Jr. during their acceptance speeches. But then Lee throws in tacky, tiresome jokes, such as Bill Clinton sitting in the Oval Office enjoying the black T&A commercials on TV. He manages to attack almost every famous black or white enterprise (such as UPN) or celebrity in the media.
And the ending really falls apart, I won't give it away but it veers off into another territory-""snuff films"". Stick to one controversy at a time! The only thing to look forward to at the end is the separate video montage of early motion films and animated shorts featuring Black Americans in unflattering, stereotypical roles (which also sheds new light on earlier films with Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, and several other white entertainers from that era).
While I applaud Spike Lee for dealing with the issue of minorities in the media, the way it's presented is very clunky and illogical for today's audiences. You can't tell weather he's taking it seriously or not (a similar problem in the very tame film-adaptation of ""American Psycho"" where the lines between comedy and drama were blurred). Basically the minstrel show concept was unrealistic. Considering that the dialogue isn't good and some of the acting is too over-the-top, ""Bamboozled"" seems more like a caricature skit you'd find on the now defunct ""In Living Color"".

If we examine the film carefully, it causes us to question the representations of African people in American media today. To what extent have those representations moved beyond the stereotypical blackface stereotypes of the early 1930s?  And to what extent do African people have an influence on these representations?
Many viewers my not like how Lee chose to resurrect and tell about blackface, ministrel show history, but in my view he wrote, directed, and produced a creative modern documentary that raises questions about contemporary flicks and WB programs like Booty Call and The Parkers.

1271761,3,B00003CXP9,"I was thinking this was going to be a biting social commentary about a black guy that tries to get fired from his job for creating a minstrel show.  That should have been the focus.  Unfortunately, the movie goes on WAY too long, and goes off in all sorts of unrelated tangents.  I get the point that he feels that a lot of black entertainment is not that different than minstrel shows of the past.  I liked the television spoofs of that notion (most noteably the tv commercials featuring black people and their bootys), and that general direction.  But you definitely get the feeling that Spike Lee has a LOT of hatred in his soul.  The main white guy is obnoxious and offensive (quite often the case in Spike's movies), and most of the black characters are portrayed negatively as well.  Many issues are addressed, much of which added to the unfocussed feel of the film (police shootings, use of the ""n"" word by both black and white folks, OJ, white people that act black, etc.).  Much of this, I am sure, is what made the film seem to go on forever.  Initially, you think you get what the viewpoint is, but by the end of the movie, you may be scratching your head thinking, ""what was he really trying to say?"".  Spike's obvious disdain for the way black entertainment is packaged for mainstream America is somewhat annoying, only because white entertainment is often embarrassing as well--black people don't have the market cornered on low-brow laughs.  I just feel like Mr. Lee needs to lighten up a bit.
Still, a provocative piece of work that will stick with you awhile.  However, my favorite Spike Lee movie to date is still his first:  She's Gotta Have It.

Many reviewers here have said they wish he'd made the movie as a documentary...actually, it's already been done and I highly recommend the Emmy-winning video ""Ethnic Notions."" It's widely available at many libraries.
This is a personal peeve: We have enough work to do in race relations, so I wish Spike Lee wouldn't use his formidable reputation to perpetuate silly urban myths. In this film he has a fake ad for ""Hilnigger Jeans"" a reference to the urban myth that Tommy Hilfiger supposedly announced on Oprah (or Larry King) he was dismayed to see his clothes worn by Blacks and Asians. (According to Oprah herself, Hilfiger's never even appeared on the show. Nor has he been on Larry King. And think about it: why would anyone say something so financially self-destructive?) Spike fanned a similar urban myth in a 1992 Esquire interview in which he claimed Liz Claiborne had stated (on Oprah, of course) that she didn't want her clothes to be worn by wide-hipped Black women like Oprah and he urged everyone to boycott Claiborne.  Again, she's never even been on the show.

1271765,4,B00003CXP9,"Sure, the movie has problems but deserves acclaim for these reasons: It points out that rappers are putting on a modern day minstrel show. I use to like rap a few years ago, but todayevery rapper on the radio is trying their hardest to look and sound as stupid as possible to entertain their 70%+ caucasian audience. Consider the scene where Mantan has the body of chicken and then look closely at multi-platinum selling rap star Nelly's performance at the Super Bowl half time show. He's stooping, and flapping his arms like chicken wings. Coincidence? This film attacks materialism which is what every ""urban"" song is about and every ""urban"" video promotes. Mainstream rap is going the way of the Roman empire and they don't even realise it.
  I'm probably one of the few people who can say that 'Bamboozled' was the first Spike movie I ever saw. Since then, I've seen 8 other Spike joints. The reason that 'Bamboozled' didn't make an impact is because people are tired of Spike making movies about races at war, because he's already proven that he could do that. Spike should've made a movie about racial harmony, because it does exist. It couldn't hurt and it's probably what the public is waiting for him to do.",997315200,,1216,4.704225352112676
1271865,3,B00003CXP9,"This was a hard movie for me to watch because I did not want to deal with the emotions stirred up by the horrible images of African Americans that proliferated through this country during the 1800's. I mean it was hard enough to get through that during history lessons, but the idea of watching an entire motion picture about a minstrel show -- coal black faces, bulging eyes and bulbous red lips -- was unsettling to me. I could barely stand to see the trailers with Savion Glover rasping ""Shoooooooowtime"" as he poses with his bright white gloves next to his blackened face. Despite my misgivings, I felt like this movie was important enough for me to try to get over my discomfort. See, I had read all the controversy about what various entertainers thought Spike was saying with this flick and wanted to judge for myself.
Everyone is fair game in this movie. Buckdancing entertainers who are so happy for a gig that they will sacrifice their dignity, mercenary television networks that will pander to the lowest common denominator if it means better ratings, the public that eagerly sops up whatever garbage Hollywood foists upon it, wannabe revolutionaries, white folks who think they are blacker than black and self-hating negroes with their pretensions (that accent is really annoying). Yep, Spike goes after everyone with mixed results, which leads to my only real criticism of this movie -- it tries to do too much and winds up disjointed.
The first half is cool. Actually, it's kind of funny watching Wayans hatch ""Mantan, the New Millenium Minstrel Show."" In just one skit Tommy Davidson manages digs at M.C. Hammer, Kirk Franklin and Juvenile. But by the second half things kind of fall apart. I never really understood whether Wayans' character actually bought into the warped thinking that this ""satire"" was actually a good thing. I was not sure whether he was simply parrotting the spiel hatched by the PR person or whether he honestly believed that his show had a purpose. In the segment where he wins the award there are a couple of scenarios that could be read either way as he mimics the acceptance speeches of Cuba Gooding and Ving Rhames. ""I could play the grateful negro and would always work in this town,"" Wayans muses.
The ending is totally disappointing and far-fetched. Not to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but there is high-drama and senseless violence at the close.
On the whole, this is a worthwhile flick because it will force you to think about some serious, unpleasant things that most folks would rather ignore. Further, I don't think that any of us should ever forget these subhuman images of Black folks that were as commonplace as table salt. I daresay that if more of us were aware of these idignities that we couldn't help but to shun some of this ... palmed off on us as entertainment. There is nothing cute about buckdancing, bulging eyes, or shuffling. I think Mr. Lee's underlying premise is that minstrel shows are still among us, but the performers are no longer wearing black face, and the public loves them. Spike, I can dig it.",996624000,2,3085,4.757462686567164
1271866,5,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee has done it again -- written and directed a biting satirical film on the subject of race that makes the audience squirm.  He's always been able to do this, and this film pushes the envelope further than he's ever done before. Damon Wayans stars as a African-American Harvard-educated television writer who is ""bamboozled"" by his white employer into writing a minstrel show television series using black people wearing blackface and including humiliating racial [preconceptions].  Jana Pinkett Smith is cast in the role of his assistant who tries to bring a sense of reality into what is going on. Both are excellent actors.  But the movie really belongs to Savion Glover, the young tap dancer who made a name for himself with ""Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk"".  I've always known he was a great dancer, but this film brings out the range of his acting ability.  Cast in the role of the as the star of the TV series, Mr. Glover has the ability to show his inner conflicts by just the set of his face or the look in his eyes.
Against this story line, Mr. Lee has chosen to also give the audience a history lesson by his use of wind-up toys and other artifacts from the dark period of minstrel show history.  The artifacts clutter Damon Wayans' desk and there are many camera close-ups of these relics from a bygone era.  There is also a lot of  vintage film clips from old movies, TV shows and cartoons which depict the demeaning [standards] that was always taken for granted.  When all of this is put together,  there is a sense of outrage at the unfairness of it all.  As the film goes on, the jokes start to wear thin.  And the actors start to have misgivings.  It doesn't seem to be funny any more and it becomes more and more uncomfortable.  And then, at just the right moment, a horrible act of violence escalates into horror and the sadness of the ultimate conclusion left me shaken.  When the video was over I felt I had just experienced a small work of art that played with all my emotions.  It also made me understand just how deep and humiliating the minstrel era was to African American people and just how far reaching this racism is. If you can stand the discomfort, do see this video.  It will challenge your perceptions, make you think and bring an aspect of American culture to light that deserves to be looked at.

1271867,1,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee is a rich black filmmaker who successfully exploits his alleged anger at racial stereotypes in his movies.  In the unfortunately titled BAMBOOZLED, he takes a sledgehammer to a questionable notion for a satire on American media, race, and ratings and pounds away until all that's left is a bitter, lengthy, harangue devoid of wit, style and humor. This is one tedious mess of a movie that feels like it's about ten hours long.  Daman Wayans is Pierre Delacroix, the lone African-American exec at a TV network.  His white boss Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport) wants him to come up with a ""black"" show to rescue the failing network.  Not a ""Jeffersons"" or ""Cosby"" but something hip and ""homey"" friendly. What he delivers is ""Mantan: The New Millennium Musical.""  It's set in a watermelon patch and stars two former street entertainers in black face.  This travesty becomes an unexpected hit (a la ""The Producers"") but Lee's movie quickly disintegrates into a senseless, disjointed hodge-podge of unfocused subplots. There's a love triangle and gun-toting revolutionaries.  Blood is spilled. Bleakly visualized and tedious, the whole enterprise sinks in a morass of self-righteous preaching.  For those who endure,there is one redeeming, brilliant touch at the very end: a montage of archival footage that displays demeaning racial images from popular entertainment.  It has more power and says everything the previous 136 minutes fails to deliver.  There's also a tedious feature-length narration by Lee, deleted scenes, music videos and a making-of documentary.  Too bad the whole subject wasn't a documentary like Lee's searing ""Four Little Girls.""",995932800,16,1653,5.319230769230769
1271868,4,B00003CXP9,"Say what you will about Spike Lee, but don't ever call him subtle. ""Bamboozled"" is about as subtle as a riot. Trying to point out the continued degradation of African-Americans in popular entertainment and getting its title from a quote by Malcolm X, Lee's film creates a ""Twenty-First Century Minstrel Show"" that is shocking, overwhelmingly racist, and proves its point remarkably well.
Damon Wayans tries out his dramatic chops as Pierre Delacroix, Uncle Tom-esque television writer who decides (either in an attempt to get fired, or to make a point to the network or the viewers, who knows) to create the Mantan show, featuring two down-and-out street performers (Tommy Davidson and Broadway tap guru Savion Glover). The ""Mantan"" show is set in a watermelon patch. It features, among other characters, Aunt Jemima and Lil' Nigger Jim. The actors are in blackface. The show is horribly racist, the performers become increasingly dehumanized, and the show is a huge hit.
Wayans proves suitable as the torn writer, though his accent seems a little forced, and keeps reminding us of his ""In Living Color"" days (not that it's such a bad thing, ""In Living Color"" was a fantastic show, but it's distracting). The cast as a whole is wonderful, with Jada Pinkett-Smith as Delacroix's conscious, Michael Rapaport as the white television producer who is ""down with the black man,"" and a stellar turn by rapper Mos Def as the frontman of a politically charged hip hop ensemble, Mau Mau. Oh, and the house band is The Roots. The best performances, though, come from Paul Mooney as Junebug, Delacroix's comedian father who refused to sell his soul, and from Davidson and Glover as the stars of the show. Their performances highlight the best of minstrelsy: incredibly talented black performers who had to reinforce negative stereotypes if they wanted to work.
Lee manages to get quite a few punches in, directly mocking award acceptance speeches by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ving Rhames, and even throwing a jab at Pinkett-Smith's husband, Will Smith. The most painful punch, however, is the one he throws to the racist television industry, which continues to portray blacks, with some exceptions, in pretty much the same way it did in the days of Amos and Andy. A great film to see; watch out for a serious lack of political correctness, but keep in mind that you should be offended.",995846400,,2368,4.952261306532663
1271869,3,B00003CXP9,"Even a failure by Spike Lee is often more interesting than a success by many another filmmaker.  His latest film, ""Bamboozled"" attempts to come to terms with the quandary faced daily by many African Americans:  in a world where white people hold the majority of the wealth and power, can a black person move ahead without sacrificing his or her own roots and heritage in the process?  Does aiming for success in a white man's world automatically peg that black person with the derisive epithet ""Uncle Tom""?  And, if that is indeed the case, what option does that leave an ambitious black person in determining his own future and place in society?
To examine this theme, Lee has chosen to concentrate on the microcosm of entertainment television, an area that has often fallen victim to this schizophrenic view of Black America.  On the one hand, television has been attacked for portraying a white bread, homogenized view of middle class blacks in series like ""The Cosby Show,"" while at the same time being criticized for catering to lower class stereotypes in more ""realistic,"" urban-oriented shows as ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Good Times.""  Lee has decided to aim most of his barbs at the latter type, creating a scenario in which these stereotypes are reduced to their most obvious, insulting level.  Damon Wayans stars as Pierre Delacroix, a pompous, pretentious but, we're told, brilliant comedy writer who comes up with the idea to create a show so offensive in its nature that it will shock all Americans into reexamining their own misconceptions and prejudices about blacks.  His idea is simply to resurrect the spirit of Amos `n Andy, hiring a tap dancer and his partner to appear in black face on a weekly television variety show.  When his program director, Mr. Dunwitty (played by Michael Rapaport in an absurdly over-the-top performance) agrees to green light the idea, Delacroix finds himself with a surprise hit show on his hands.  But what price success?  For Delacroix begins to question whether or not the program is really being appreciated for its ""satirical"" bite or whether it is instead being taken at face value by a racist, undiscriminating audience.
The idea has potential, but Lee, alas, is never able to bring it off successfully.  For one thing, the black face routine seems strangely uncontroversial this late in the game.  Why resurrect an issue that has long since been laid to rest?  Lee hits his satirical target much more effectively in the brief commercials we are afforded glimpses of than in the lame, gruelingly unfunny sketches that take up long stretches of the film.  We simply cannot believe that these tired, badly staged routines would strike even the most devout KKK member as amusing.  Yet, here we have an entire studio audience, as well, presumably, as an entire viewing public, rolling in the aisles in hysterics.  We are even told that the critics have taken the show to heart.  We don't buy it for a second.  Perhaps, if Lee had chosen a more contemporary assortment of black clichs and stereotypes to lampoon (as he does in those commercials we see), the film would have had more point and purpose.
Lee does hit on some interesting periphery issues along the way, such as the absurdity of having black-oriented shows put together almost exclusively by white writers and producers.  The film also exposes the paradox inherent in the fact that even the most radical anti-establishment elements and images of the hip-hop, gangster rap culture are not impervious to exploitation from the likes of Madison Avenue.  In other words, young people, teens in particular, are bamboozled into supporting with their money the very elements of corporate America they are supposed to be protesting against.  Let's face it:  when your ideals become fodder for yet another sitcom, you know the cause is lost.  (This theme was explored much more fully and brilliantly, however, in James Toback's far more gripping film, ""Black and White"").
""Bamboozled"" really hits the skids in its closing section.  Painful as the black face skits are to watch - more for their ineptness than for any sense of moral outrage - the real pain comes in the final scenes in which Lee loses his satirical nerve and makes a bid for high tragedy.  The characters, suddenly hit by a fit of conscience, go through a lot of introspective soul-searching about ""selling out"" and all that, looking droopily at the camera as portentous music drones on the soundtrack.  Particularly offensive is the film's misguided attempt to turn itself into a modern day bloody ""Network,"" the sheer heavy-handedness of which is simply appalling.
Then, after all this mess, Lee tacks on a brilliant coda which shows us just how thoroughly black face permeated our culture and entertainment in the early part of this century, assembling an assortment of film clips not merely from Amos `n Andy shorts but from such respectable cultural touchstones as Andy Rooney/Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and Shirley Temple films.  (In the ultimate irony, Lee is forced by copyright laws to pay homage to each and every one of these clips in the closing credits).  Thus, as a historical document, ""Bamboozled,"" I guess, has some validity.  But is it really relevant to today?  Perhaps, but certainly not in the modern context in which Spike Lee has put it.

Bamboozled left me speechless and ready to take further action aganst stereotypes that the media--and unfortunately many African-Americans--has perpetrated against my people.
It was a stroke of genius that Spike used two well-known comedians who had participated in such modern day minstrel shows (Damon Wayans and Tommy Davidson) to illustrate the point of his movie.
The one person in the movie who was integral to making folks wake up was Jada Pinkett-Smith, who gave each character gifts that would hopefully open their eyes up to their self-inflicted blindness.
Bamboozled truly made me think (as most Spike Lee movies do).

With that said, he takes the Black Nationalistic view of Blacks on modern television, which is that it has not advnced as muhc as many would like to believe.
Most of the other scenes have been discussed by the other posters, but I particularly liked the Mau-maus because before rap degenerated into gangsterism, you had a lot of ignorant rappers who called themselves ""teachers"" misleading the youth like the blind leading the blind. The Mau Maus, as they drunkenly and ridiculously pontificate on social issues, remind me a lot of this. To quote Jada Pinkett-Smith in her dialogue with them in this movie-""Y'ALL IGN'ANT!""
This aside, there are some really deep moments showing how dehumanizing forms of entertainment tends to dehumanize all who partiucipate in them. For example, when Damon Wayans fires Saivon Glover for refusing to wear Blackface and throws him out of the studio. Says a lot. I also applaud Spike for having the perspective to show the similarity between the minstrel show and modern rap videos (such as ""The Bomb"" malt liquor).

I've never been a huge Spike Lee fan - most of his movies just bore the hell out of me. I had no intent to see Bamboozled. However, after an accquaintance convinced me that it was worth seeing, I rented it.
When the movie first started, I had high hopes, which were quickly rewarded. Damon Wayans is great in a role unlike anything I've ever seen him do before. The beginning of the movie is just plain cool and fun to watch. Wayan's uptight TV producer occasionally breaks off from his serious tone to say something utterly hilarious. When a marketing expert offers, ""That's the name. Catchy, isn't it?"" He quickly retorts that ""So is syphilis.""  The movie was smart, it was quick, it was gritty, and it was just plain interesting.
I really started getting into the film, but however as the impact of what they were doing to themselves and their people started to hit the main characters the movie started to go on a downwards spiral into vagueness and strange behavior.
There are two main problems I had with this movie. The first is simple plausibility. In the film the show is a runaway hit, but only the most racially biased and ignorant people would enjoy the show that Wayans has produced! All the characters, even the African-American ones, find themselves giggling at the character's antics, but I found myself barely cracking a grin. The second quibble I had is that it criticizes a problem that is pretty much nonexistent and not nearly as extreme as Spike Lee seems to think. The entire movie is centered around blackface and how the whole public loves it and totally enjoys keeping black people inferior and stupid through the makeup and cartoony look and so on and so forth. The end of the film features dozens of clips of blackface characters in films and cartoons, as well as numerous still of blackface paraphernelia, for lack of a better word. But blackface is dead! If it reappeared in the form we see it in ""Bamboozled"", it would be dead in two seconds. These clips and toys displaying blackface are all from before the 1950's! You can't judge modern society by toys made over 60 years ago! You would expect a stinging social critique from the movie, but it's really just a bunch of ramblings about how things USED to be.
I suppose one could interpret the film as really being about how black entertainers will gladly sacrifice their race's dignity for popularity, but honestly that rarely happens to the extreme this movie displays. And for every show with a mostly white cast and idiotic black characters, there's a show like ""Smart Guy"" where the entire cast is black and most of the white characters are dorks, jerks, or simply wallpaper.
Bottom line: This movie is cool enough in the beginning to garner the film 3 stars, but switches gear too strongly onto a nonexistent issue and ends up just spinning it's wheels.",989712000,3,2946,4.676300578034682

I had the pleasure of purchasing BAMBOOZLED on DVD, this past weekend.  ""RAW"", ""WOW"" and ""OUCH"" are the words that would come to mind discussing this film.  If you ever doubted Spikes' talent as a writer and director - doubt no more.  BAMBOOZLED is a SATERICAL dramady.  Hoping to get fired, a black TV executive reinvents the old blackface, song and dance minstrel show only to witness, to his horror, it become a huge hit among viewers.
You're either gonna love or hate this movie.  This movie is not for the squeamish or for those who want their movies nice and neat, and where thinking is not required.  There are a lot of offensive images [what we deemed to be offensive] as well as offensive language though outs this movie - which runs two hours plus - it's not a comfortable ride.  You find yourself laughing when you know you should be offended.  Head nodding agreeing with some of the characters.  Disbelief in others.  While watching, you tell yourself that it couldn't happen, no way a show such as this could make it to networks.  You sure about that?  Look at many of the shows that geared towards us today and you realize that Spike ""ain't"" too far off in his assessment.
The main character is full of self-hatred and negativity for himself as well as family members.  It's interesting, 'cause in this movie, no one is completely good or completely evil - just operating on different levels.  As much as I would love to go more into details about the characters, it's very difficult without giving away the movie.
The images in the scenes are powerful.  The first time the characters put on the blackface makeup.  The first episode taped.  The reaction of the audience.  Like I said, I squirmed in my seat during the movie.
There are two running commercials throughout the movie [or during the television show], one is a malt liquor called ""Da Bomb"", which is 125% proof alcohol in a bottle shaped like a bomb, and it's also known as the black man version of ""viagra.""  The other is ""Timmi Hillnigger"", yes you read right - ""Hillnigger"".  I'm sure you can imagine what his image is.  During the commercial there's a line used, ""stay in the ghetto, be poor, and by my clothes.""  Like I said, this movie ain't for the easily offended. Like I said, Spike makes you face issues - as in all of his movies - that you rather not deal with or would rather sweep under the table.  And as with all of Spikes' movies, the ending is shocking that you never saw it coming....
If you do wound up purchasing the movie, may I suggest that you get the DVD version.  As usual, there's the normal bunch of goodies on it.  The main two are about 20 deleted scenes that never made it to final cut and a special ""behind the scenes"" documentary.

1271982,3,B00003CXP9,"Spike Lee's Bamboozled has a powerful premise: a Harvard-educated African-American television executive named Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), frustrated at his inability to get serious projects about African-Americans placed on television, pitches the ridiculous concept of a revived minstrel show to his white bosses.  Thing is, his idea backfires because the bosses LOVE the idea.  So does the audience.  It becomes clear that Delacroix has underestimated the latent racism and bad taste of the American public.
If this satirical premise sounds familiar, it's because it builds on one of the best comedies of all time: The Producers, Mel Brooks' first big hit.  Remember that film?  The producers tried to make a flop by staging a ridiculously grotesque musical called Springtime for Hitler, but the audience loved it.  But whereas The Producers was fairly light-hearted all the way through, the last third of so of Bamboozled turns way too heavy and ultimately pummels the viewer with a point that's already been made, again and again.  Spike Lee seems to think his film deserves a kidnapping and mass murder to make its point, which I think is a huge mistake.
Not to say Bamboozled had to be just funny all the way through.  Good satire hurts even while you're laughing.  And there are some truly inspired, thought-provoking moments in this movie.  Watching the African-American actors struggle with their consciences while donning the blackface; seeing how white individuals struggle to relate to black people, without full awareness of either their own inherent racism or the social structures that reinforce it: these things are great, and Spike Lee portrays them better than anyone else could.  I also liked the montage of blackface scenes from traditional American movies at the end, that shows better than anything the disrespect African Americans faced until recently.  But the minstrel show itself is neither funny nor particularly revealing, and the violent subplot doesn't really belong in the film at all.  Spike Lee would have done better, I think, to shorten the film and leave out the gang-related subplot.",988934400,15,2125,5.2514792899408285

Spike Lee takes no prisoners in his most recent film.  Bamboozled depicts the entertainment industry's inability to produce shows that render African Americans in roles contrary to the stereotypes fostered by a history of deeming and negative portrayals.  Lee's ""in your face"" approach can be somewhat off-putting.  It's not surprising that the movie didn't do well at the box-office.  The movie does do an excellent job of putting the issues faced by the writers, filmmakers, executives, and actors on display.  The pressure on writers from executives to deliver hits that pull in the ratings and therefore the money.  The uneasy predicament of African American actors left with the choice of earning a living in their profession given the absence of powerful, positive roles available in the industry.
The most significant aspect of this movie for me was the subtle but certain assertion that mainstream America has little interest in shows that feature African Americans in roles that enlighten audiences to aspects of African American life that fall outside of the poor, crime ridden, comical characters we've become accustomed to seeing.  Isn't it the viewing public who drives the ratings?  Isn't the viewing public primarily made up of Middle American non-blacks?  Don't we have the right/responsibility to reject programming by tuning out?  So why was Mantan and Sleep-and-Eat such a big hit?  I can't help but wonder how the production staff and actors in the film felt during the shooting, if the movie changed in any way their notions of the industry and their role in it.  Bamboozled is a serious film, depicting serious issues that should stay at the forefront of the American television and film industry.  If not, the new millennium will take on the face of the old establishment. If you're looking for an escape, this isn't it.  If you're looking for another perspective on the traditional portrayal of African Americans by Hollywood (from one who's intimately familiar) Bamboozled is well worth your time.",988243200,9,2266,5.051075268817204
1271984,3,B00003CXP9,"After the terrors of ""Summer of Sam"", Spike Lee has come up with ""Bamboozled"", in which he roasts TV and the way it exploits the black population. Unhappy with his situation at a television network, Pierre knows he can be sued if he quits, thus breaking his contract, so he figures out a fail-safe solution: he'll get himself fired by producing a show so outrageously offensive it will cause a racial backlash. (It's a variation of ""The Producers""; even the initial audience reaction is similar.) Pierre is a re-invented man: he wears expensive suits and greets us with ""Bonjour"", but about half-way through the movie we learn his name is really Peerless and his father is a second-level night club comic. Pierre is very sensitive to racial issues, and so he's convinced his proposed showcase will be a shocking failure: a minstrel show for the new millennium. Two Afro-American street performers are re-named Man-Tan and Sleep 'n' Eat and put into situations (in a watermelon patch, no less) displaying how lazy and untrustworthy Negroes are -- but, hey, great tap dancers! The two are even required to wear black face. (I assume the N word cannot be used in Amazon.com, but it's used ad nauseam in this screenplay.)To Pierre's consternation, the show is a big hit; and he is faced with the dilemma of denying his principles to court success. In fact, he has fantasies of winning everything except a Nobel Prize. One of Spike Lee's strongest points as a writer-director is providing flashy roles for capable actors. I was appalled that Samuel L Jackson's performance in ""Jungle Fever"" was ignored by the Academy. In ""Bamboozled"" Lee has provided several such oppportunities, though nothing as showy as Jackson's. At first viewing, Damon Wayans may seem a little excessive with Pierre's affectations, but look again. Paul Mooney is compelling as his father, an entertainer who realizes he's gone as far as he's going to go. Savion Glover, Tommy Davidson, Michael Rapaport, and Jada Pinkett-Smith are all good in their different roles. (Al Sharpton and Johnnie Cochran play themselves, and one can't help but wonder: did they realize they were satirized?) The big flaw in ""Bamboozled"", the reason I can't give it four stars, is the violence with which Lee has chosen to end his dark comedy. I think it would have been much more powerful to circumvent the deaths and have the characters, chastised, watching the devastating montage which closes the picture: the humiliations, the buffooneries, the relentless yassuh yassuh yassuh that degraded black people for generations. It's the death of the spirit that is the revelation in Spike Lee's screenplay,and he weakens that message with physical destruction.",988070400,6,2704,5.051454138702461
1271985,5,B00003CXP9,"Bamboozled is an incredible movie.  It forces issues that have been latent and residing in the unfortunate margins of society.  This is true and real and needs to be seen by everybody.  I had the fortune to meet with Spike Lee the day I viewed Bamboozled and realized what a sincere person he is and how seriously he takes productions.  Also, he has a silly side.  A great man and a great movie.  I'm not intentionally plugging him for president, but both his life and work have made a big impression on me...one that I will never forget.  One that I will not forget to pass on as Lee passes on the knowledge.",987984000,,609,4.336283185840708

It is so enlightening and shows you why the entertainment industry is the way it is. People don't want to see positive images of blacks on media. They enjoy the negative and pretend there is no black middle class. They keep the focus on negative, uneducated and poverty stricken black people so America believes thats all there is. They keep showing images of black criminals until the word criminal has almost become synonymous with black.

7917533,2,B00003CXP9,"With all the famous successful black comedians in this movie, I expected it to be a funny movie, but no, it was not funny. I guess it has some value in that it shows how black people were depicted in those very old movies, but please don't forget that race relations have evolved very much in these modern times. Please don't forget that a major war was fought in large part to end slavery and a whole lot of white men died fighting in that war. Dr. Martin Luther King knew that and he set a great example by urging people to not fill themselves with hatred, but instead be assured that racial equality and harmony would eventually come. There are a million examples to point to that prove that we are either there already or at least very close here in the 21st century. Thank goodness!",1496620800,,787,4.360544217687075
7917534,1,B00003CXP9,"what can I say about le spike that isn't already profusely 'known'. the blurb on the dvd let's you 'know' that this is 'another slide' into his 'familiar' territory. (forty acres and a mule, jake - where is it/why you try to fool the black).

the story (as it is) sets the 'white' man up as the deceiver of the 'black' man (again). the black man is a 'pretentious' money maker 'selling-out his people' to make lotsa mullah!!!!!! (the American way). said black man sets out to make the most racist act ever made in the hopes of it being attacked for what it is - but the opposite happens when it becomes the 'greatest thing since sliced-bread'.

it is choca-block filled to 'overflowing' with 'every single racial stereotype' afforded in the mighty U.S of A. but it's ""OKAY"" because it's written and directed by a negroe/black/African-American/whatever they're called this week man.

it's 'supposed' to be 'satire' ---- but it's as funny as a funeral. who knows where le spike is going with his stories. it's 'always' hyperbole when he releases a 'film'. he has 'power and privilege' and yet ALL his films are whining about the 'injustices' he has 'suffered'.

if you're 'studying' race relations in the united states of America, this won't help.",1494720000,,1245,4.776744186046511
