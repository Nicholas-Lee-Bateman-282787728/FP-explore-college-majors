8046949,5,B0007D4M9K,"It was quite hard to find this particular volume to complete the series. Even Amazon had a delay in sending this item. I was quite elated when they were able to send it. It arrived in perfect condition. Oh, ""Chrono Crusade"" is an superb Japanese anime. Great plot with philosophical theories woven within the storyline. Ending will bring a tear to one's eye. The characters are that well developed.",1373500800,,398,4.782608695652174
8046950,3,B0007D4M9K,"Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria are travelling by train across America from New York to San Francisco in order to find Rosette's brother Joshua, who is being held by Aion. On the way, a photo of Joshua is handed to Rosette by a fellow passenger, asking for a meeting in the dining car. In the second episode, our heroes find themselves walking to San Francisco through the desert until Satella gives them a ride, but there's another problem, Chrono has collapsed with a high fever and no medicine seems to work! In the last episode a demon shows up at Satella's villa but he's not there to fight. He's there to join forces with the Magdalene Order to put Aion back in his place.

While Chrono Crusade is still a great show, the balance between humor and drama is starting to grind a little. The plotline is becoming such that the underpinnings of tragedy and sacrifice are not lending themselves to slapstick comedy anymore. Another distraction is that the devils are not scary at all. In fact, they're almost laughable. To me, if you're going to do a story about devils, you should at least make them threatening looking. But the characters are still interesting and their relationships seem authentic. No extras of any depth here but many superficial, mainly conveying background information.",1122854400,,1291,4.815315315315315
8046951,5,B0007D4M9K,"The quest team's journey to find Joshua has begun, but all hell literally breaks loose when a certain well endowed Fraulein and an old enemy both show up on the train. As the jaws of a nightmarish trap snap shut only the Magdalene Order's elite training will keep them alive, but is even that enough? The forces of good may be hopelessly outmatched!

A DVD-only release, including three complete episodes in both English and Japanese language versions, with English subtitles. Extras include: reversible cover, clean opening and closing animation, production sketches, Azmaria's Extras Classes video, background info for characters and setting, and ADV previews.",1121299200,,662,5.365384615384615
8046952,5,B0007D4M9K,"Chrono Crusade is reaching the expectations of it's fans. These episodes are great reaching deeper in the bag of it's already fantastic storyline. The show gives a little more info on Rosette's brother joshua and shows the beginning of a great battle between good and evil. Chrono is getting to close to changing to his full devil self because  Rosette takes some pretty hard hits and almost lets him go. Both are still battling to find Ion so Rosette can find her brother joshua. Crono crusade is doing great, The story is getting better and more intense every episode and you actually start to wonder if stuff like this is really happening who knows.",1111708800,4,652,4.719298245614035
