4254042,5,B0043988J4,"Or so it seems. Much is revealed about the history of the planet, it's moon and the giant bots from space.  The plot builds to a crescendo of destruction and revelation in the final few episodes. It's one of the few shows (Anime or otherwise) that actually surprised me! Characters that at first seem shallow and ""throw-away"" are instead pivotal. Van was definitely a Cowboy Bebop clone, albeit with a different dietary bend. What's with the condiments? The series follows Van as he crosses paths with various baddies, unwillingly helps out the helpless, unwittingly gets entangled in nefarious plots (often at the hand of his buxom gal-pal) and saves the day - usually at the expense of his dignity and dinner.

This really is a great series. I watched it for the first time last month in three evenings.  It had one of the most annoying intro songs ever (some guy moaning), but one of the best story lines I've seen in a long time.",1313712000,,933,4.642424242424243

4254045,5,B0043988J4,"Just got the Funimation release of Gun Sword today and was pleasantly surprised to find that this is really a 5-DVD set.  The 26 episodes of the series are on the first 4 DVDs and then there is a 5th ""Extra Features"" DVD in the back of the case with what I believe were all the extras included with the original Geneon releases including...YES! the 13 Gun Sword San episodes.

I think with the inclusion of the extras, it makes this set a great value, but I wish Funimation would do a better job of getting the correct information out on their releases.

The series itself is very good blending the Western/Mecha genres together. It has been compared to earlier animes like Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Trigun and the main character Van does seem somewhat similar to Spike from Cowboy Bebop.  It also has an odd main villain in the form of the Claw who preaches friendship and harmony and wants to ""save"" the world but has no qualms about tearing apart anyone that interferes with his plans.  Maybe the story isn't that original, but it does a good job of being entertaining throughout.

The packaging is pretty basic , but still nice with all 5 DVD houses in a normal size DVD case with a glossy cardboard slip-cover.  I actually prefer these type of releases because of the space (and money) that is saved compared to when anime series were released over 6-8 DVDs, though I do miss the artwork from the covers and artboxes a little.  The video is 16:9 widescreen and the transfer looks solid from what I've watched so far.",1291852800,13,1522,4.529197080291971
4254046,5,B0043988J4,"Fantastic series. My personal favorite. It is great news that Funimation picked this one up and is going to republish it again. Sadly usually when this happens, they tend to cut out some of the extras from the original release. Hopefully included in this will be the goofy Gun Sword-san episodes. But I would really doubt that judging from the price. Still, great show, great characters, and it'll keep you watching old episodes again and again. Watch both dubs if you can. This is probably the only series I've seen where I wished I could combine both dubs. The voice actor who plays Van in English is exceptional. So are a few other characters. But then theres some in Japanese which are great too. Enjoy!",1290729600,7,707,4.664

Saw the first episode on VCast when it came out, and was hooked immediately. Yes, the show can be cheesy at times, but I think that adds to the appeal.",1472601600,,280,4.73469387755102
4254067,3,B0043988J4,"What happens when you combine Cowboy Bebop and Trigun together but forget everything that made those two special?

The result is Gun X Sword.

 Lets see: it begins with a doomed love story and this story is centered on characters confronting their past (like Cowboy Bebop). It has the main characters aiding people on their journey and the entire series is set on an Earth-like planet with a Wild West feel to it (like Trigun). In essence, Gun X Sword is unoriginal but in this day and age practically every anime title has some aspects that have been employed before. With Gun X Sword, a quality storyline couldve materialized with the aforementioned foundation but injecting a mecha element into the mix seriously tampers with an already-fragile framework. With this series directed by Goro Taniguchi, the mastermind lording over the famous Code Geass, it is almost a guarantee that robots would be smashed into this show. Despite the obvious disaster that a Wild West mecha title would be, Gun X Sword mightve redeemed itself if it had a different protagonist.

 You see, the protagonist in an anime series exercises much more power than commanding a legion of action figures and/or body pillows from his or her likeness. A protagonist can single-handedly elevate an otherwise mediocre title into a memorable and worthwhile investment (like in Great Teacher Onizuka). A protagonist, a really well-written one, can transform a quality series into a transcendent title (like in Monster). However, Gun X Sword, seeking the perfect poster boy for their series, unfortunately chose Von. He is a complete replica of Spike Spiegel, from his long, lanky frame down to his nonchalant demeanor (Even Vons actor David Vincent desperately attempts sounding like Steve Blum). It would be acceptable if Von was just another generic, overly cool loner but his entire personality revolves around Gun X Swords driving plot (finding a man with a claw for a right hand because he killed Vons fiance) and has no other purpose outside of that. Throughout his journey, our frustratingly passive-aggressive protagonist is labeled with a gamut of useless, unessential nicknames from those he encounters (Garbage Dump Von, Pretty Boy Von, Nice Guy Von, Von of the Dawn, etc.) that ultimately does little to conceal the fact that Von is but a two-dimensional character. Theres nothing to him besides dousing his food with every condiment imaginable, taking lengthy naps, fighting people with his Armor (Thats what people label mecha in this series), and getting pissed at the mention of The Claw. Again, unoriginality isn't horrible but, if shallow Gary Stus like Von are the result, then I want nothing to do with it.

 Even if a series contains a disappointing protagonist, it is usually redeemed thanks to an unforgettable supporting cast (like in Last Exile). That isn't the case with Gun X Sword. Wendy is arguably the series most likable character but even she has her unbearably irritating moments. Wendy has more practical intelligence that virtually everyone else in Gun X Sword but she also has jarring moments of stupidity. Wendys character development improves immensely throughout the 26-episode duration of this series but she is often spotted emptily hoping for Von to save the day. Wendy, Gun X Swords primary hero, is a character of contradictions. Carmen 99, the Faye to Vons Spike, is an even less-developed character than Wendy, a fan-service tool with microscopic levels of depth trapped in a forced rivalry with a femme fatale of the worst kind (Carmens rival is Fasalina, voiced by Karen Strassman, whose superb acting chops couldve been better employed than for a role as a shallow ex-prostitute). Despite Gun X Swords overwhelming portrayal flaws, they are greatly redeemed through a memorable collection of one-shot characters (from the enigmatic Joe Lutz and the hyperobsessive Driver Twins to the menacing Lucky and even the ever-stylish Kaiji), The Claw (whos among animes most interesting and complex villains), and my favorite character Ray Lundgren (passionately played with a show-stealing performance by the great Liam OBrien). He serves as an intriguing antihero as well as Vons antithesis. Ray, this sullen, socially inept loner with poignant flashes of rage, has the most stunning Armor design in the series as well as the shows most complete character arc. Ultimately, what I don't understand about Gun X Sword is how it contains a masterpiece like Ray Lundgren and a ditzy one-dimensional nobody like Priscilla (whose lack of attributes I won't delve into for the sake of your time) in the same cast.

 Consistency, or its appalling lack of it, is an issue in Gun X Sword that permeates through every aspect of the show. Most anime titles have a knack for convincingly shifting between light-hearted comedy and ultra-serious drama but, when Gun X Sword attempts to pull this off, it comes across as poorly-planned and awkward. Virtually every episode begins with Jamieson Prices famously low-toned voice as the Narrator, eloquently establishing the episodes setting with an overwhelming amount of dry bleakness. Yet, every episode of Gun X Sword, especially the early ones, is littered with tiresome antics and unbearable witty one-liners. Its as if Gun X Sword cant decide whether to be hilarious or dramatic and this results in the series screwing with its potential. For example, after the magnificently moving episode 16 (literally the only one in the series that I consider flawless), Gun X Sword decides to follow that with the fanservice flop that was episode 17; it was the most pointlessly raunchy spectacle that Ive ever witnessed. Gun X Swords soundtrack sadly does little to elevate this series from mediocricy, as the OST here is serviceable yet forgettable; theres some jazz here and some folk blues there but the music fails to inspire (excluding hitomis relaxing yet emotionally stirring Paradiso and Yukino Satsukis energetic and climatic Niji no Kanata). Oh, and the theme song is simply fantastic; its what convinced me to check out Gun X Sword in the first place.

 Gun X Sword has evident ties to the shonen genre, with its generic trash-talking and stilted fight scenes betraying itself, but practically every quality shonen knows how to inject depth and dimensions underneath. In Gun X Sword, whats beneath the surface is a reasonably worthy plot that contains more holes than a tennis racket. In a climatic outer space showdown between Von and Wendys brother, there are no sound effects for the Armors laser beams. In the series third to last episode, Ray reveals that his Armor is the prototype that the Original 7 (a once-great organization created to protect the Earth long ago) based their Armor designs from but that is impossible unless Rays fiance, the one who built his Armor, was secretly an elderly woman. Above all else, Gun X Sword never, ever gave a solid explanation, explicitly or implicitly, for why The Claw murdered the fiances of Von and Ray. I mean, you cant conclude a story without addressing why it started, right? Right?

 Whats worse about Gun X Sword is that, although it concluded nicely and amusingly, its possible for the series finale to have been better executed and the series overall left me to wonder what couldve been. In the last episode, our heroes converge together and, in the overused situation of a dying planet, they strengthen their resolve through the always-cheesy power of fwendship. The show then abruptly cuts to the heroes post-victory celebration (Ummm. what?). When the credits rolled, I started to wonder what Gun X Sword couldve been if it had a more enjoyable protagonist, if it bothered to explain everything, and if it had more scenes like the one at the end of episode 19 (It was the ultimate tearjerker moment, the most heartbreaking and gutwrenching character death that Ill ever lay eyes on. That scene is how you make a grown man cry). I know Ive bashing Gun X Sword for its many faults but what I absolutely cannot deny about this anime is its parody mini-series (only available on DVD). Known as Gun X Sword san, this is an utterly enjoyable experience wrapped in 13 episodes, with four minutes per episode. Gun X Sword san obliterates the fourth wall over and over and over (Its mantra: This is a kids show!). It pokes fun at otakus, the anime industry, America, and even the governor of Tokyo. Each and every episode discusses or is about something different (Theres even a really off-the-wall whodunit). However, what matters more than the basis of Gun X Sword san is its interesting interpretations of characters from the original series. It is here where the good-natured Wendy is portrayed s a delusional and domineering tyrant with a ridiculous violent streak, where Von, the coolest guy ever, is reduced to the shows primary source of verbal abuse, the butt of everyones jokes. Overall, Id say Gun X Sword san is more entertaining, more enjoyable, more memorable, and is simply all-around greater than the original series. When somebody states that your spinoff series is better by leaps and bounds than the one you're more invested in, you know you screwed up somewhere. Thats the thing about Gun X Sword; its impossible to find a factor in this show that it didn't completely botch. No wonder barely anyone watches this show.",1471219200,,9338,5.028442146089205

4254073,5,B0043988J4,"As much as I really wanted to rate this show compared to the older series that are in this sub-genre of anime that are truly classics, it is unique enough, and well put together to garner a five star rating among the likes of shows like Samurai 7, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis which I consider all as prime examples of great classics..

I purchased this set without prior knowledge of the show, and was pleasantly surprised.

It has a good mix of hand to hand fight scenes. If you are at all a fan of Cowboy Bebop, a lot of the fight scenes are very reminiscent of that particular style. The action is easy to follow, and doesn't leave you thinking they left some animation scenes out. It also has some of the elements of a Mecha series which are also done well. There is a good blend of Mecha fighting with personal stories and effective plot and character development. It felt a little like Big O at time to that respect.

Voice talents for the American dubs you'll recognize. Funimation has a lot of good American voice over actors if dubs are your preference. The script is a little cheesy at times, but if you are a fan of anime, you probably have just come to expect this. It isn't obnoxious or forced feeling.

Though this is a revenge story, I felt as though I cared about the characters plight even though the whole revenge theme does get a little overplayed at times. I cared about what happened to the characters, which is rare for a lot of series for me. The plot did seem a little forced at times, but on the whole I found it cohesive and thought out.

The only negative thing I might say is that the plot varies from serious tones that sometimes feel a little forced, to polar opposite lighthearted and not-so-serious at all tones. While a cohesive plot, I felt at times the tone was a little inconsistent.

Still, all that aside, this is definitely worth a look. I would recommend this to any sci-fi action anime fans out there as a ""Cowboy Bebop inspired Revenge story with elements from Trigun, Scryed, and even a little Samurai Champloo at times.",1430956800,4,2066,4.437994722955145

4254088,5,B0043988J4,"I didn't buy this collection (own the original Geneon dvd's) but I love this anime and I wanted to review it anyway, I'm really glad it's getting a re-release. You could call Gun Sword a mecha-anime and you'd be partially right, but first and foremost it's a revenge story. One sentence summary: Van suffered a terrible loss at the hands of a murderer known as the ""The Claw"", a young girl named Wendy has lost her brother Michael to marauders and wants to see him home safe, their paths intersect when it seems The Claw now has Michael is his possession. Many other characters and subplots come into play (and some of them are very bizarre, even by anime standards) but the main focus is Van's revenge. I really liked the narrative and Van in particular, he's doesn't fit into any kind of anime stereotype (some of the other characters do, but this often seems intentional.) He's lanky, lethargic, and generally apathetic, only bursting into fits of extreme anger upon mention of the man who took everything from him.
The English dub for this show is way better than I expected, especially considering the relatively small fan base in the US. David Vincent is a damn good voice actor, it's criminal he hasn't been in more anime. One scene in which Van has an emotional breakdown just sounded so believable, that must have been one hell of a recording session! Another thing that tends to make of break my final opinion of an anime is the ending (looking at you Wolf's Rain) and Gun Sword's is very satisfying (also hilarious.)
If I had to criticize the show, I'd say that a few characters probably could've been written out to the betterment of the show (Ray's brother Joshua was pretty pointless, the main character even attempts to ditch him several times). The animation looks good, but sometimes the budget shows with action scenes with numerous still frames or animation that appears a bit disjointed. But ultimately it's a unique and entertaining show, with a bizarre but often hilarious sense of humor and a story with some real emotional weight.",1411084800,2,2054,4.740223463687151

I've watched and rewatched and I always find something new I didn't notice before. Excellent storytelling - every time the show seems like it might steer into stereotypical territory with character actions, it doesn't go where you think it will. It is anime, so there are a few weird things, but they're delightfully weird, not offputtingly weird. Watch it! Everyone keeps comparing it to Cowboy Bebop and Trigun, and while there are some things in common, I think GunxSword is its own thing and I like it better! :-)",1406505600,3,794,4.802919708029197

When people state that it is a ripoff of other anime, I say that they are homages to other anime, and Van as the Clint Eastwood-like main character pulls it off, with his devil may care, dry humor, and delivery that sets it above other anime.

4254107,2,B0043988J4,"I've been sifting through the S.A.V.E. titles looking for rare gems of animes that shouldn't be there.  ""Gun X Sword"" should.  This is an example of a product that is overstuffed with cloned material from successful anime, and as a result it resembles a horrifying Frankenstein monster of shows you like, and like Frankenstein's monster, it's ugly and likes little girls.

The main character ""Van"" is a clone of ""Vash"" from ""Trigun"" and ""Spike"" from ""Bebop.""  He's on a vengeance quest, hunting down the man with the clawed hand, which thrusts you into the storyline of ""Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Blade of the Immortal, Samurai Champloo, The Fugitive, etc, etc.""  It's not a bad premise, but it's been done to death and this show doesn't offer anything new to it.

Van's weapon is sword, that's also a whip, and also calls a robot from space.  All the bases covered yo!  That part is not too bad, as the animation is good and if the show would have just resigned itself to nonstop action then we might have something here.

Action takes a back seat to a plethora of side characters that are predominantly female.  They're all there.  The cute, plucky girl that's looking for her brother has a childish insight that consistently digs up bottomless pits of tired morals, and offers to marry Van in the first episode.  There's the older, heavily busty, gypsy, vagabond, rebel that's too cool for school but carries a weathered heart of gold and who would also lay down for Van in a cheap second.  There's the Mech driving pixie that wants to have fun and fight so she naturally sees Van as a challenge in the cockpit and on the cockpit.  Anime shows that are girl crazy and laced with Lolita complexes are rampant and sometimes work, but it hurts Gun X Sword BADLY.

The comedy is there and almost makes you laugh, but doesn't.  The fights are there and are almost cool, but instead neat.

All in all, this is a show that serves as a perfect example of why taking every successful aspect of popular shows, eating them and crapping them out still just smells like crap.  As a S.A.V.E. title with good animation and standard fan service, you can enjoy it for what it is.

Interesting ending. . .",1366416000,,837,4.354838709677419
4254123,5,B0043988J4,"Love this anime! It reminds me of Cowboy Beebop - it's got a hint of darkness, great characters and lots of laughs.

however, the case this set comes in sucks. Part of the hinge has broken and the center things the dvds click onto are chipping away, while the first center ring has broken off part of the disc. I don't know if mine is defective, or if this is a problem with other sets,  but if so I recommend putting these in a different case. However, the discs themselves are excellent quality, the show looks great and I am still pleased.",1360972800,,542,4.303921568627451

4254125,1,B0043988J4,"Desperate for new anime, I bought this series and all I can say is that you get what you pay for. I couldn't watch past the first two episodes. Full of cliches and shameless ""borrowing"" from other series, Gun X Sword is a waste of time and money.",1350864000,,246,4.145833333333333

It was a good buy however and it really sort helped my collection. This, however, was one of those I watched and just wouldn't latch unto.",1338249600,,266,4.34
4254127,4,B0043988J4,This series is very comical and sometimes over the top. The primary characters sport great chemestry and the animation is more than decent for a series. -Jult Warfell,1337212800,,166,4.964285714285714

8414332,3,B0043988J4,it's a very good series only reason I gave it a low rating is because the ending credits are only in Japanese there's no English cast credits,1521936000,,141,4.2592592592592595
8414333,5,B0043988J4,"As far as animes go, this one is an interesting blend of ""Outerspace Western"" with the typical ""Mecha"" giant robot genre (with the obligatory Samurai/sword aspect).  The scantily-clad heroines are a bit risque for what is after all a young-adult serial.  (""Carmen99"" - the secret agent whose number refers to her bust size - in centimeters ... and let's not even get started on ""Fasalina"" the bad/good female character ...)

... but I digress ... Van is a typical sullen swash-buckling hero bent on revenge, and Wendy Garrett ... well, actually I don't know why she's in this series other than her character ties all the other ones together ...

... to the point, and the main reason I am writing this review is the ... SOUNDTRACK .... this is the most original, hip, ""Sergio Leonesque"" soundtrack you will ever hear in any anime .. there are scenes where the music makes it sound like Clint Eastwood is about to appear to engage someone in a duel (the Eastwood of the ""Man with No Name"" Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, that its ....)

I have both of the CDs (yes, there was so much original music that it required TWO CDs for the entire soundtrack) ... and I would heartily recommend both of them ... I listen to it while I'm working .. upbeat, hip, cool ... and an interesting and eclectic mix of several musical genres ....",1520208000,,1333,4.560669456066946
