6268679,5,B00IKM5OYW,"The movie deals with a lot of social issues, a few being poverty, race, classicism, and the lack of a formal education. This film setting is somewhere deep south; I'm basing this on the physical environment and confederate flags that are visible from time to time. Joe is actually a good guy with a short attention span attach to very short fuse. Joe is southern trailer-park trash who have just cross path with poor white trash; A fifteen year boy who was born with 4 strikes. Joe takes the audience on roller coaster through the backwoods to save this  young man not only from himself but from a seriously dysfunctional family. This is something a little different for Mr Cage but I like a lot.  two Thumbs up for JOE!!!!",1397347200,,723,4.553846153846154
6268680,5,B00IKM5OYW,"I can't believe the negative comments on this movie. Probably Nicholas Cage's best ever. If you like dark, gritty movies set in the South, don't miss this.",1397347200,58,155,4.777777777777778
6268681,4,B00IKM5OYW,"Joe (Nicolas Cage) is your basic good man with a low snap point. He works a crew under the table for the logging company. He has his vices and everyone in this small rural community knows him. Gary (Tye Sheridan) is a fifteen year old ""boy left behind"" who has issues with his drunken lazy father incredibly portrayed by Gary Poulter. Joe attempts to help the boy out without getting involved, while helping out others...everyone but himself.

The film moves slow to build character and background material. The gritty drama far outweighs the action aspect. This is a film that reminded me of ""Winterbone"" where we see a piece of a Southern rural community sliced open.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex and nudity (Sue Rock?)",1397347200,121,727,4.808
6268682,5,B00IKM5OYW,"Directed by David Gordon Green, Joe opens with a teenage son chastising his alcoholic father.  The decrepit patriarch has once again misbehaved and brought trouble to the doorstep of himself and his family, forcing them to drift to another town.  The father hits his son and teeters into the distance; there, a group of men emerge and beat him.  The son leaves the scene as the sound of landed blows echo.  This grim scene sets the stage for the overall film, a heavy Southern-Gothic meditation on failure, family, and masculinity.

The aforementioned son is played by Tye Sheridan, who, between this film, The Tree of Life, and last year's Mud, has mastered the art of playing Southern lads on the verge of transitioning from earnest childhood to hardened knowledge of the adult world and its perils.  The bastard of a father is played by the late Gary Poulter, a real-life bipolar drifter and former G.I. cast on the street.  Poulter received a terminal cancer diagnosis shortly after the end of the production and later drowned in a small pool of water, inebriated.  (This knowledge only intensifies the impact of a brutal, lived-in nonprofessional performance.)  And the great Nicolas Cage delivers one of his most rewarding performances as the title character, an introverted ex-convict who heads a tree-poisoning outfit and becomes an improbable mentor to the Sheridan character.

Green, who here laces the grand visual poetry of his debut George Washington with arsenic and old-fashioned suspense, gives the central trio of characters time and space to reveal themselves, and they emerge as flesh-and-blood characters who are at the same time almost mythological in their sunburned, forgotten-by-society-at-large melancholy.  Cage, always existing on the line separating the A-list movie stars from the wild-eyed character actors, is the perfect choice to play a man whose day-to-day existence in an exercise in extreme self-control.  Joe is a bit of a bastard, and he has a fire inside him, yet he is also tender and desperate to be the best version of himself given the circumstances of his existence.  It is a delight to see Cage portray this internal conflict.  I am not sure any other high-profile celebrity performer could do it so well.  The film in general is highly entertaining and involving, however foreboding and profane.  There are points which honestly invite a reaction of, ""Christ, can they shoehorn one more filthy, larger-than-life, mean-spirited character into this crazy film?,"" but it is always a fleeting response because the characters and their hard-edged arcs are just too riveting to turn away from.",1397347200,,2633,5.145539906103286

6268684,1,B00IKM5OYW,"I'm a Nicolas Cage fan, but to be honest, the script had him so drunk throughout the entire movie that his talent as an actor was not able to be utilized.  In fact, just about everybody in the movie was drinking, smoking, or high in nearly every scene --very one-dimensional plot line.  Oh, and it is a very predictable movie... no twists or turns or surprises.  And, all the characters are so much alike; by this I mean that they are all pretty shady, sleazy, trashy, violent, disrespectful, uneducated, etc., which made the movie a bit boring.  Here is a spoiler alert... I think also that I would have named the movie something to do with the bridges, something like, ""Mud Creek Bridge"" since the two very poignant scenes occur at both the start and end of the movie on the same bridge.  I also would have stopped the movie on the bridge... the final scene could have been pretty cool with some sort of soliloquy or great realization by the old guy... or maybe the old guy has a final fight with Joe.  Or, maybe the old guy goes off the bridge lands in the creek bed and picks up the gun that was originally thrown off the bridge... he fires back up and kills Joe... that would have been surprising.  I thought that the two minutes after that final bridge scene were pretty irrelevant, and that the bridge scene could have been exploited for something more.",1397174400,4,1360,4.459677419354839

6268754,3,B00IKM5OYW,"(Minor Spoilers) Only about 20 minutes into the film, you start to realize ""Joe"" (Nicolas Cage, whose fans will not be disappointed) and 15-year-old ""Gary"" (Tye Sheridan) have quite complicated and dark lives.  In fact, the director takes you into a world rarely seen on film (complete with a deer-gutting scene and extreme dog-fighting violence), as ex-con Joe hires young Gary and his abusive Dad as manual laborers and eventually becomes Gary's protector, after witnessing Gary's home life firsthand.  But, alas, maybe it's Joe who needs protection of his own from his impulsive and explosive ways.  As in ""Sling Blade,"" it's quite the challenge for film-makers to combine the gloomy and occasionally disturbing subject matter presented here with tenderness and emotion.  And in that way, the presentation of ""Joe"" as a film, though with formidable performances, doesn't quite hit its mark; it's like those Olympians you see just missing out on a medal by coming in 4th place.",1500681600,,979,5.177215189873418

6268878,5,B00IKM5OYW,"As I watched this movie it engrossed me into its world of abandonment.  Everyone in this movie has been forgotten, left behind, and given up on.  Every life is a product of seeming hopelessness.  The protagonist, Joe (Nic Cage), is an ex-con who's chosen to keep his head low, work a day's wage, and move forward in the midst of an isolated, lonely life.  He passes his time in sordid ways, though at his core he longs for something more.

In Gary (Tye Sheridan), Joe finds a troubled teen who is a mirror of himself as a young man, on the cusp of giving up, and drowning in pain, anger, and violence.  One of the most poignant scenes is when he and Joe go out the an old abandoned ship yard and practice smiling through their faces of pain.  This is a snapshot of the movie.  As Gary is faced with the pure evil of his father, and the sordid relationships he has with alcohol and others, Gary is at the crossroads where Joe took the wrong turn earlier in life.  The movie portrays Joe as an anti-hero who chooses sacrifice over self-preservation, redemption over ruin.

While the movie unfortunately promotes violence and vengeance as the way to atone, it also shows that we must fight violence with love, selfishness with sacrifice, and evil with good.  While these themes have been explored numerous times over, the way Director/Producer David Gordon Green tells it is so rich and raw that it deeply resonates with your own heart, all the times you were left, all the moments of isolation, all the anger and hopelessness it produced, it echoes inside.  The movie takes place in the contemporary South, but its real setting is the human heart.",1473984000,3,1645,4.57679180887372

6269424,4,B00IKM5OYW,"I'd give it 5 stars for the acting. Everybody in it was really playing difficult characters like pros. The drunken father really was convincing. He was a dead ringer for the looks and actions and speech of a derelict drunk. It's hard to believe he is actually a normal actor (if any actors are normal). I take a star off for really bad presentation of morality. When I read the teaser before watching, I thought it was going to be a feel good movie about 2 really different people becoming friends.

What is messed up is that the protagonist good guy is really a low-life jerk that barely keeps his bad behavior subdued only part of the time. He is supposedly being a replacement for the kids' drunken father, but he drinks all the time, goes to a whore house all the time, and then takes the 15 year-old kid out and gives him beer and lets him drive his truck while drinking. He really had no basis to be self-righteous about the father's bad behavior. Seems like he might have learned a little something about his own behavior by watching this kids' father.",1458086400,,1059,4.458762886597938

It amounts to a conglomeration of disjointed scenes and non sequiturs that left me asking a bunch of questions after struggling through it...namely, ""Who Exactly is Joe"", and, ""What the heck did I just watch?""  Even if this dvd were free, I would return it and pay the return postage, just because I don't want it anywhere in my house. Don't waste your time and/or money.

6269962,5,B00IKM5OYW,"There are probably many more cogent reviews of this movie.  Here's mine, for what it's worth.  I just finished watching this, on Amazon Prime.  I didn't know what to expect, not having heard of it, and not being a fan of Nicolas Cage.  This film lured me in, first with a light-heartedness, then in a dirty and grimy way.  But the characters were real, as real as people I have known.  And the acting: again, was it acting?  The kid, played by Tye Sheridan, was authentic as it gets.  He is the soul around whom the rest of this world revolves.  Joe is the main character, a hard-working, hard-drinking, short-tempered guy with a good heart, providing jobs for the lower class workers that reside in the rural area.  We are soon made aware of the extreme lower edge of his social peers, the local whores, the ""poor white trash"", the criminal element festering just under the surface.  The sets used here evoke the realism of extreme poverty, hopelessness and moral decay.  Add to this the local law enforcement who are seemingly out to get those who have already spent time in the ""big jail"", as Gary calls it, which includes Joe.  The movie moves along slowly at first, then increasingly and naturally builds to a climax, once we are fully committed to life as Joe knows it.  As I watched I felt the need to pause the movie and go wash my hands, or throw up.  I could smell the cigarette smoke and the dog s***, and feel the blood and the dirtiness of existence there.  I laughed at some things, and could believe I was with Joe and Gary drinking and driving and feeling good and normal.  I also felt shock at the violence that was just underneath the surface of all these people, and the connection it could possibly have in me.  The cinematography is masterful, and the score is appropriate, especially toward the end.  Nicolas Cage as Joe delivers a wonderful understated performance.  Tye Sheridan is amazing as Gary.  His father is played so real it's scary.  I recommend this film, to be watched alone, late at night, for the full impact.",1451174400,,2045,4.545205479452055
6269963,1,B00IKM5OYW,"very slow movie, all the way to the end.

6270535,1,B00IKM5OYW,"I Watched this on demand and I can tell you that I will not be buying this. This makes out to be a heroes tale but if it is it's the least of one I have ever seen. This film is the epitome of ugly that shows the lowest a person can sink in soulless evil and it is graphic both physically and verbally and in no way could this be mistaken for art as vomit could be mistaken for roast beef. My father used to say poor people have poor ways and this shows in every character with almost no redeeming qualities except in a small way in the boy who you feel sorry for as you realize he's doomed to the same low class squalor with almost no hope of making it out due to lack of education and opportunities. I Can't believe Nick Cage made this film or that anyone green lighted it. The complete and utter disrespect for law enforcement is also appalling and something that is not needed with today's problems. I suggest you pass this by and look for something entertaining which this is not, you want a Nick Cage film pull one of the older ones out and enjoy that because if you go for this you will be wishing you could un see it. And one last thing these people who are portrayed here do exist and I have seen it, there are certain types of people who are broken and soulless ugly and ignorant and they like the filth they live in and they cannot be fixed.",1442102400,,1351,4.082706766917293

6270609,4,B00IKM5OYW,"In this remake of a 1970 film by the same name, Nicholas Cage plays Joe, an ex-con and unlikely hero to a fifteen year old boy. The story is called Joe, and you'll figure out why by the end, but to be honest, I saw this film more as a coming of age story, with the majority of the focus on Gary (Tye Sheridan). Gary's family is difficult to say the least, both his parents are drug addicts, and it's up to him to earn a living to support his sister. One day while out in the woods, he comes across Joe, a man who owns a lumber company and persuades him to give him a job. Gary is a hard worker who comes to see his boss as more of a father figure than his own father, and when things get bad, he's turns to Joe for help. Joe is no saint though, as he has his own criminal past and is reluctant to get involved. This is one of these really dark, slow moving dramas, where everything may or may not be important to the story. The real action is spaced out, but when something happens, the intensity is off the charts. This film is very similar to, Winter's Bone, which also had a young lead trying to save her siblings. While Tye Sheridan is not Jennifer Lawrence, his more quiet demeanor makes him more likable in the eyes of the viewer. Sheridan is a kid who came out of nowhere to star in the independent film, Mud, and since then has become known for making these super dark, intense films, where he plays a quiet, reserved character that one can't help but root for. Nicholas Cage is equally as good in a role that is more dramatic than most of things he's done lately. That being said, Cage still has it and together with Sheridan make for one of the most interesting and unique films I've seen all year. The story and even the trailer seem to be a little dull, most people will look at this film and see it as too slow and dramatic, and at first, I thought so too, but as the film progresses it just gets better and better, ascending to the level of a must see movie.",1441497600,,1972,4.11139896373057

Book by Larry Brown

[Here be Spoilers]

Larry Brown, whose book is adapted in the move version writes gritty, no nonsense, true-to-life stories about Southern working-class folk.

As the director acknowledges in the DVD supplements the movie is an interpretation of excerpts from a much larger story. Whether or not you buy Cage in the role he is upstaged by Gary played by Tye Sheridan in any scene they share. In the opening scene Gary sums up his father as alcoholic, selfish, predatory. Feeding his need for alcohol will always come before feeding his family and he'll do anything including kill to get money to buy booze. I don't personally buy the screenwriter/director's decision to have him commit suicide at the end.

To me anyway, the developing relationship between Joe and Gary is the basis of the story. Expect no fairytale endings here.

Will Gary mature to be a clone of his Father or will the role model provided by Joe's arrival in his life hold sway?",1439078400,,974,4.767857142857143

Film breaks down certain society norms and connects you with the two troubled men who are doing there best to do good.",1437696000,,495,4.767441860465116
6270844,5,B00IKM5OYW,"I usually try to avoid such dark and bleak movies; they can mess with one's dreams.  But I couldn't take my eyes off the performances, nor could I stop thinking about it for several days.  I am not sure what people's problem is with Nicolas Cage;  he is a WORKING actor and he has been working since THE OUTSIDERS.  Even the best of actors who work as much as he does might do a stinker or two, but so what?  He is intelligent, keeps himself in fantastic shape, and he can still become totally immersed in a character.  JOE is awesome work, and I am glad Cage took the risk.  Tye Sheridan is wonderful; he is not blessed with ""eye candy"" features, so his acting ability shines; one feels as if he or she KNOWS this kid and pulls for him as hard as Joe does.  And like Billy Bob Thorton's work, Southern Gothic LIVES...  My only objection is that people like Joe and Gary and Wade and mother and sister, do not only live in the south.  Every state has homeless, alcoholics, domestic abuse, and demons, and some seeking redemption, or the innocents like Gary, who only needs one kind hand to become a true hero.  I think Joe's disappointment and anger with life are best told in the newspaper scene about the child being killed at a zoo.  ""Three years old-- a little kid is killed.

6271014,4,B00IKM5OYW,"Ex-Con 'Joe Ranson' (Nicolas Cage) lives and plays by his own rules, he's tried to control his temper
and dislike for authority in the shape of the local law-enforcement.
Joe' is in the Forestry business he pays a fair days pay for a fair days work, he's a no nonsense guy.
Though he try's to stay out of trouble, trouble tends to come his way, the backwoods people have a
way of life all of their own.
'Joe' comes across a young lad 'Gary Jones' (Tye Sheridan) who's looking for work, he'd seen the lad
the previous night by the grocery store he where he picks up and drops off his work crew.
'Gary' has a torrid home life, taking a regular beating from his alcoholic father.
He gives the 15 year old a chance to earn, 'Gary' proves himself a good worker.
Joe' befriends the youngster which is somewhat out of character, but has realized the problems 'Gary'
has at home, 'Joe' becomes very protective of the youngster.
Backwood rough-necks that have crossed 'Joe's' path before appear to be causing 'Gary' and his young
sister problems with the blessing of his waste of space father, 'Joe' will need to do what he see's as the
right thing.
This is 'Nicolas Cage' at his best in this gritty and no-nonsense backwoods drama, it is on occasion pretty
violent, and should hold your attention.
Takes a little while to wind-up perhaps but well worth taking time-out for.
Good picture and sound quality throughout.

6271072,4,B00IKM5OYW,"What I find extraordinary (and despicable) is the willingness of so many pople who didn't like this film, nevertheless to review it without having finished watching it. ""Joe"" is a materpiece of 21st Century Verite film making, about real people in real situations that most of us will be fortunate enough never to encounter or even suspect exist. The performances, both by the professional actors and the recruited locals are impressive to the point of overwhelming which may be what makes this film so difficult for so many people of the alien/adventure school of short-attention-span reviewing. It requires willingness to step out of the comfort zone of our own selves and - while paying close attention -  slip and slide in the fetid social and emotional effluvia of people not like us for the sake of learning a new thing about human nature - and our relationships to the rest of the human race. That this experience was so masterfully crafted as a piece of film fiction is greatly to the credit of everyone involved in it. Now, that said, I must, in the interest of full disclosure admit that I found the film so morally challenging and emotionally rigorous, that for all its excellence, I could not bring myself to watch it again.  Some of its truths were just too realistically brutal to face again as entertainment.",1435622400,,1323,4.798245614035087

6271078,4,B00IKM5OYW,"Joe is one of the messiest, tangled, depraved, heartbreaking and powerful films I've seen. There are harsh moments that made me look away, and there are stunningly powerful shots that had me glued to the screen.

Im a fan of character dramas and I often enjoy coming-of-age stories, and Joe excels at both. The characters are richly explored (in their glory and depravity) and painfully believable. We live in a pretty messed-up world, and while we often turn in our face away in reality, this film shoots you straight. From the alcoholic, abusive , deadbeat father to the violent, lascivious, hardworking Joe, these are real people. Analyzing the film, its important to not call evil good, and I think it avoids doing that quite well. With the flawed Joe being the role model for young Gary, we see some powerfully beautiful contrast between the two, and also the painful reminder of how our seemingly small influence can affect others deeply.

The acting here is jaw-dropping. This is Nicolas Cage at his absolute best, the late Gary Poulter who was himself a homeless alcoholic, pulls off an incredible performance as the dad, and Tye Sheridan is simply one of the best out there. Despite his downfall into low, cheesy films, Cage proves once again here that he is an incredibly adaptable actor and he nails the complex role of Joe. Sheridans performance is flawless. His ability to handle super complex and very difficult roles is incredible, and in every film I've seen him in, I have yet to doubt one second of his performance. With talent like this, hes only rising in the industry and I hope he isn't like so many who have been destroyed by it.

My four stars are not for recommendation or content. This is a harsh film that shows a little more than is necessary. But for the ideas and portrayal, Joe knows the story it is telling and conveys it exceptionally well. Everyone in the film industry seems to claim that story is king, but the films produced don't always live up to the teaching. In telling a great story, Im passionate about seeing characters that are real and well-explored, good or bad, and that is the greatest strength of this film. There aren't many good guys, and as such, its a slightly depressing film to watch, but if you choose to go into the darkness in Joe, may its subtle, powerful moments inspire you and the darkness challenge you to live in the light.",1435449600,,2388,4.680952380952381

6271336,4,B00IKM5OYW,"Normally I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage but he was scary and believable in this film about lost souls and how a boy's childhood can shape him. Tye Sheridan was remarkable as the boy who still retained enough youth in him to use a stick in an imaginary game in a weed patch,but had enough adult in him to know that his good-for-nothing father was going to keep beating him and drinking and steal from him forever. Joe's recuse of him from his life with his father and the boy's rescue of his sister gave whatever hope the viewer could find in this film. It's probably a true depiction of back-woods in any state where folks do what they need or have to do to stay alive. It's definitely NOT for children, but did cause me to think.

Nicholas Cage gives a very good performance also.  The movie kept my interest throughout as it was an atypical story in that I'm not from the south nor familiar with the different customs and attitudes, at least not from personal experience.  For me, this was Tye's movie and he kept me riveted every time he was on the screen.  I've seen him before and he always puts in a great performance but it would be hard to top this one.  He was fierce, and kind, and giving, and moral, and forgiving, and protective, and sweet, and strong, and resourceful, and all in a very natural way.  In short, he was completely believable.  For me that's what made this a good movie instead of an average movie.  There were other strong performances from the supporting cast also.

Cage delivers a fantastic performance about a bad man gone good, but who still fights against his demons. He tries not to interfere in the wrongdoing of others but eventually sees something the need to do so. How can you protect that which is unprotected?

A movie worth watching! It is not dark or disturbing... It simply shows humans at their worst, and at their best.

The way the abused is portrayed about how difficult it is to get out, considering other family members still trapped and the hopelessness of the situation was pretty accurately represented for someone who thinks an abused person can 'just walk away whenever they want.'

When You do not grow up with A Moral Compass .Awe must a our selves a life with out Salvation from our sins,Is it our own fault, or a Societal fault in The belly of The Beast of America ? The Strong Must have mercy and help the weak. When you abuse Children,you abuse the rest of Societies in the world !

America is A blue print if we want it for Gods Heaven !

There is no doubt in our common sense morality,Evil  does exists and Satan has the power to enter into those whom are born from Evil blood lines. Think the Pharo of Egypt who Turned away from Moses message from God ! and I hope you understand  what i am trying to say about what I saw in this movie.

It starts you off in the middle of things and you don't get any back story to build on... there's no 'getting to know the characters' first.  The opening scene is the boy berating his drunk father for something he did (that you never find out what it is); father smacks son and walks away;  father comes upon two random men on the trail and one beats the crap out of him, while his son walks calmly away, down the railroad tracks and looks back periodically.

Joe is a overall good man torn apart from a troubled past. However, this troubled past is not really revealed beyond his short prison stay. I thought Tye Sheridan played an excellent part in the movie whose actions and emotions are understood by the situation he's in with his family. I liked how the plot weaved the characters together which was not evident until nearer the end. There's a lot of DOG-phobia but I'm not sure why!

In general,  I think that too much footage was left on the cutting room floor and the story line was weak, but it has redeeming parts and you feel the tension within yourself as the characters move in and out of the movie.",1426896000,,785,4.444444444444445

Disturbing, on many fronts, and very 'realistic' to the 'geographics' of the movie; In short, you get lost in it (And somewhat depressed), but the cast is excellent and the cinematography is surreal.

Cage does a great job",1426636800,,297,4.711538461538462

He must have wanted to do this movie, I felt dumber the more I watched this movie, the acting and scene shots were horrible. At times the scenes seemed rushed and other times I thought they would never end. It was nice in the concept of helping a disadvantage down and under young man. The beginning totally confused me, I thought it was a flashback scene for the kid but at trend of the movie it didn't clear up the begining,,,,,lost.

The tension only lets up somewhere in the middle when Cage and Sheridan go on a larky dog search.  This seemed very contrived and I couldn't let myself enjoy it because I knew more horrors awaited.  The movie wasn't badly made, it is just plain and simply an ugly story.  So if you like that sort of thing, enjoy!

6273650,4,B00IKM5OYW,"A good film.  People who are bagging on it either didn't watch closely or were already chomping to jump on the Nic Cage hater bandwagon.  The movie is overwrought at a few moments...hard to find films that aren't these days.  That said, it's admirably quiet, punches up in sound/action when it needs to--which all the more accentuates the strategy of the ""quiet"" character development, and the actors delivered.  The only especially ""overwrought"" moment is the voiceover monologue about mid-film, and its the only time Mr. Cage slips, but it's only his voice--his body work is excellent throughout--and the monologue is on the writer and the director in my opinion.  Regardless, a fine story and finely shot and acted.  If you're looking for ""bells and whistles"" and all the stuff that keeps modern cinema so unnecessarily ""busy"" on the screen, then this isn't the film for you.  It's far from a perfect story, but what the hell does that mean anyway--the only thing clear is when people hate good things just for the recreation of hating.  Thanks for solid story experience Mr. Cage, et. al.  Brave movie.",1426291200,,1106,4.903225806451613

Some of the scenes felt so real and accurate to the backwoods of Mississippi and Alabama, it was hard to believe some of these people were actors (maybe they weren't). The ethics of the film are questionable, but I think that's part of the point.

6274596,4,B00IKM5OYW,"This film is a real ""slice-of-life"" in that it shows the real poverty of some Southern families in the present era.  Tye Sheridan handles his character so convincingly and the viewer's heart bleeds as a result of this.  Nicholas Cage's character ""Joe"" is even more complicated because it reveals a man caught in the middle, i.e. between the law enforcement's inability to handle the many incidents and Joe's inability to intervene in someone else's family disputes.  The boy's abusive and alcoholic father is at the bottom of everyone's troubles, coupled with a town troublemaker's conniving.  The plot of the film is good but slow to at the beginning.  Once matters start to get out of hand, it picks up.  It was difficult for me to understand how people in this small Texas town all had revolvers and that they had real shootouts with other people.  On top of that, after being wounded, Joe digs out a slug in his shoulder instead of going to a hospital or even calling in the local police.  Not being from Texas, I cannot really say if this normal life or not in that State.  It's a great film for Nicholas Cage fans and Tye Sheridan is an up and coming young actor whose career is worth watching.",1425254400,,1200,4.596244131455399

So much time was wasted on the rawness of the severely impoverished and disturbed, the director forgot to make a plot. This is a B movie at best. I can't believe Nicolas Cage was involved in this. Even his acting wasn't good in this film, and that's saying something. The kid was the best actor in the entire film. The ending was very good, and artistic - death and rebirth.

6275204,3,B00IKM5OYW,"""Joe"" is a bleak and disturbing film, anchored by a steady and nuanced performance by Nicholas Cage.  The supporting performances by Tye Sheridan, Gary Poulter, and the other players feel so natural that ""Joe"" comes off almost like a documentary at times, allowing us a glimpse into some of those dimly lit pockets of America that they just don't make films about.  This element of reality adds weight to a somewhat predictable  plot, and gives the violence in the film a nauseating punch that will stay with you long after the film has ended.",1425081600,,543,4.75531914893617

The main character Joe is a mixed bag of good and evil and by the end I still wasn't sure if I should like him or hate him.  I thought that was a good touch.  What i didn't like is how slow it started, and how awkward some of the characters were - like the drifters mom, and the random girl who stayed with Joe.

Update, I just realized this movie was based on the book Joe by Larry Brown.  He wrote Fay, and Rabbit Factory also.  I have read all his books.  They are awesome.  He loved writing about the Deep South, Mississippi mostly.  I read the books in the early 2000s, so I forgot about them.  I will go to my library and reread all Larry Brown books now.  I have so many books, I forget whats in there; glad I kept them.

8643046,4,B00IKM5OYW,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by David Gordon Green, Joe chronicles events in the heart of Texas when a goodhearted-but-flawed ex-con, Joe (Nicolas Cage), befriends a 15 year-old poor kid (Tye Sheridan) from a dysfunctional family headed by a hopeless alcoholic (Gary Poulter). Ronnie Gene Blevins plays Joes rival while Adriene Mishler plays Joes maybe babe. Aj Wilson McPhaul is on hand as the likable police chief.

This is a southern gothic crime drama with a gritty melancholy mood similar to Mud (2013) and Winters Bone (2010). The guy who plays the kids dirtbag father was actually a homeless drunk who pursued acting in his youth. While he looks like hes about 68 years-old, he was actually only 53 and died on the streets of Austin a couple of months after filming stopped.

The movie depicts the ugly side of rural trash (aka rednecks) and is so downbeat some find it disgusting. Also, the film might seem sloppy story-wise, but thats because it respects the intelligence of the viewer to read in between the lines. If you can look past these issues, there are thematic gems to mine and there are occasional glimmerings of light.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 57 minutes and was shot in rural areas outside Austin, Texas (Bastrop, Taylor & Lockhart). WRITERS: Gary Hawkins wrote the script based on the novel by Larry Brown.

8643048,1,B00IKM5OYW,"The screenplay seems intent on encapsulating American stereotypes and stereotypical behaviors, with strange consequences.  For example, it's fine for Joe to visit the local bordello where young (if presumably legal) women satisfy the rough carnal urges of local average guys (we get graphic illustration of this in one scene), but we are to be outraged when a young (and not legal) teen is being sold off in the back of the van to another lusty dude.  Swift and capital punishment for that, meted out vigilante style. Why, if only they'd waited a few more years, she could have worked in the bordello!
