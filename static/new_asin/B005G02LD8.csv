4686706,4,B005G02LD8,"I actually thought this was a 3-star, but considering the b-movie horror genre it's in, I thought it surpassed most average films of this type.  I think Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez fans would get that familiar feeling watching this one.  Similar humor, and it totally borrows that ""grindhouse"" concept.

Story takes place in this drive-in theater.  Very last show(quadruple feature) before closing down for good.  Characters, pace's light, but just right for the movie.  Four movies of this quadruple features are probably 15 minutes or so long, each.  For me, the actual story taking place in the drive-in was much more interesting than the four shorts.

This film really took a lot of risks, but surprisingly, it connected on a lot of them.  Some of the humor(if you can call'em that) will be too much for some.  Even for me(pretty high tolerance), there were parts I found myself going ""really?"".  But it's fairly well done, and it is funny.  Definitely worth a rental.",1323216000,2,974,4.9079754601226995
4686707,4,B005G02LD8,"This movie was was fun experience and a perfect tribute to the Golden Age of bad cheesy Drive-In movies. It could almost pass as a sequel to either Grindhouse or Creepshow. The movie is told in 4 different segments. When the local drive-in theater is being closed down, the owner shows 4 classic horror movies for its final night.

Wadzilla- This was my favorite of the bunch. The plot is so over-the-top and goofy and spoofs the monster genre from the 60's. When a man tries to get his sperm count raised, he takes a drug and creates a sperm monster that attacks New York.

I Was A Teenage Werebear- My least favorite of the bunch. It's a musical spoof. A teenager in the 'closet' named Ricky has a desire for men. He is bitten by a Werebear and becomes one of them. The next time I watch this movie, I'm skipping it.

The Diary of Anne Frankenstein- My 2nd favorite of the bunch. It spoofs Hitler and the Frankenstein story. The movie is in black and white and spoken in a gibberish language that substitutes for German. Kristina Klebe was hot and beautiful as Eva Braun. Joel David Moore was hilarious as Hitler. He invents a Jewish Frankenstein monster named Meshugannah that begins to attack the Nazis.

Zom B Movie- This segment is shown during the intermission of the other movies. The Drive-In theater is slowly being attacked by horny zombies.

4686710,5,B005G02LD8,"This is the kind of movie you need to turn off your brain cells to enjoy. This movie is a throwback to the days of old when you would go to the drive in (when there were still drive in theaters every 10 blocks.) And you would get a great ghost show to go along with the movie. Most of the negative reviews I've read here are by people who are too young to remember how this type of movie complements a spook show, other reviewers, are old enough to remember their older siblings, talking about taking their dates to a drive in and a ghost show but, they never experienced one themselves (ghost shows pretty much died out in the late 1960's.) So, they have no context how this type of movie work in the old days. I would strongly refer you all to a movie entitled, Monsters Crash the Pajama Party. It is available here at Amazon.com on DVD. It is a history of the ghost shows of old and is quite entertaining. Watch Monsters Crash the Pajama Party then, rewatch Chillerama... It will give everyone a much better appreciation of Chillerama.",1461715200,,1038,4.355670103092783

I watched it late at night while convalescing from a painful broken rib. I was not at my best, wanting nothing more than a goofy distraction from my stupid problems, and this picture was just what the doctor ordered. It goes on and on, building weirdness upon weirdness and perversity upon perversity, and, even while vulgar enough to peel the paint off the walls, there was a certain sublime wit poking through. That is to say, it wasn't simple gross-out jokes; there was a clever angle to the thing. And I felt there was a genuine fondness for the no-budget retro-schlock being parodied. Overall, I was left with an impression of an effort made by people that knew what they were doing and loved what they were doing, and their enthusiasm drew me in.

4686724,1,B005G02LD8,"Some genuinely smart and talented people made ""Chillerama,"" which is the first reason to be so disappointed with their output. This film is frequently described as fodder for Troma fans, though I expect the average Troma fan to be way too discerning a moviegoer to genuinely enjoy this disaster. ""Chillerama"" is a scatological mess that goes out of its way to offend everyone but in the end winds up being a death by a thousand paper cuts. It's boring, it's juvenile, and it's unfunny: it's the rare bad movie trifecta.

The film is a horror-comedy anthology with linking bits. Right out of the gate I hated this movie for the wretched ""Dead Head"" scene (just don't even ask) that opened the backstory about the last drive-in in America having a closing night showing of four horror movies. The story in the drive-in is one of the poorest excuses for a linking device in recent memory, and the dialogue and acting are par for the course. I reserve particular loathing for the ""butter flavored topping"" plotpoint.

First up is ""Wadzilla,"" a feature about which I only need reveal that it is set in a sperm bank. I will say that I hated everything about this feature, particularly the finale featuring the Statue of Liberty in a thong. This entire piece is exceptionally seventh grade (at best) and repellant.

Up next is ""I Was a Teenage Werebear,"" which started with the most promise of the four until it turns into a wretched musical about unusual teen urges. Additional attractions include gaping head wounds, voodoo, wrestling, and bears in leather. While it's still difficult to pick the best of the bunch, I think this one was probably the least offensive and the least unentertaining, mostly due to its strong opening.

For the third feature, how could it possibly get worse? Well, let me tell you. ""A Diary of Anne Frankenstein"" stars Hitler (Joel David Moore) invading the refuge of Anne Frank, speaking in ""German"" with subtitles, and could not be in worse taste. Comedy rule number one: genocide is never funny. End of lesson.

While this movie dares you not to fast forward through it, I was sorely tempted during the final feature, ""Deathication,"" a fecal extravaganza that I would expect even seventh grade boys to find disgusting and tedious. The less said about this the better. Knowing that I was close to the end, I expected a lame conclusion at the drive-in: it was not merely lame, it was downright awful (think undead orgy.) As the film wrapped up and the titles finally rolled after what seemed like days (it is actually 120 minutes long,) I realized that I could not have disliked this movie more. It's so pointedly offensive that it's boring, it's sophomoric in the extreme, and each of the four features (and backstory) are essentially single joke scenes in a good anthology movie, not mini-features of their own. ""Chillerama"" redefines stretching the premise.

There are a ton of extras on the DVD. I watched most of them (""making of"" featurettes, behind the scenes, trailers, etc.) and they are universally undistinguished. I couldn't bring myself to watch the commentary and sit through the film again (which is an extreme rarity for me.) Save your time and skip the extras, you've suffered enough already. Save even more time and skip ""Chillerama"" altogether. If you have inadvertently already purchased a copy of ""Chillerama"" I recommend throwing it in a trash compactor immediately.",1414800000,,3412,4.874137931034483
4686725,5,B005G02LD8,This movie package brought me back to my child days when horror movies were scary and funny at the same time. It was hilarious. Very entertaining. You will be shocked and surprised. It was very good.,1406937600,,199,4.555555555555555
4686726,5,B005G02LD8,"This movie is not for everyone, mind you, but if you like a really good/bad schlocky B film to space out to from time to time, a movie that is so overly loaded with gross over-the-top lowbrow juvenile humor and gags, a film so disgustingly funny that it will make you cringe in shame and horror for just having watched it, then look no further than this comedy satire anthology of short films that pay homage to those old cheesy B horror movies from the 50's, 60's and 70's. And with wacky titles such as WADZILLA, The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, Zom-B-Movie, and I was a Teenage WereBear, well, you just know that it's got to be so bad that it is oh so good.

4686727,4,B005G02LD8,"My sister kept urging me to see this movie. After watching the trailer, I was beginning to doubt that we came from the same family. However, after enough nagging and to keep her from future nagging me(isn't that always the case?), I caved in and watched it.  As it turned out, it was actually a pretty good movie for those that like cheesy movies. Did anyone notice that Svengolie was the TV news announcer in the first segment??
It is the story of the last hurrah for a drive-in movie theater. It opens with the theater assistant mgr (drunk) digging up his dead wife,  yelling at her and then trying to eat her out. Yes folks, definitely not a movie to see while eating pizza.  The wife pops her eyes open, sits up and bites off the drunk's 'package'.  In the process, she infects him with Zombie-ism and thereby sets the plot line up of movies within a movie.  He infects others with infect others..yada, yada, yada.
It was very very very intentionally a gross hammy B movie...alright...C+ but it did get me interested enough to watch the rest of the movie.
Worth watching...if only to shut your younger sister up. (It's really a 3+ star movie but Svengolie gets a '+' for the cameo)",1399766400,,1185,4.493023255813953

I've honestly never laughed so hard or been so grossed out in my life (the Zombie and giant Semen segments in general). This definitely has some Troma influences in it as well as classic drive-in cheese fests. The best segment in my opinion is the Frankenjew segment, it's classic and could probably pass as a standalone movie. The other segments of the movie are funny as well, the sex-crazed zombies, giant semen, and homosexual were-bears... Yea, if you haven't seen this movie DEFINITELY check it out, It's definitely worth a watch.",1396051200,,595,4.8431372549019605

As we all know, the synopsis is pretty straight forward, anthology style horror/grind house movie.  It contains some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  Two of the three sub movies were decent but one of them was God awful.  The second one, something about werebears was how I imagine a gay porn would be like.  This movie is basically several 2 minute jokes driven into the ground for almost 2 hours.  I wouldn't waste your money or time with this movie.",1382313600,,576,4.377358490566038

4686740,2,B005G02LD8,"The twisted minds of Adam Rifkin, Tim Sullivan, Joe Lynch, and Adam Green come together to bring you the greatest midnight movie of all time! ...Well, not exactly. Not at all, actually... CHILLERAMA is in contention with CREEPSHOW 3 and SNOOP DOGG'S HOOD OF HORROR for the title of worst omnibus film ever made. It is vulgar and childish, but worst of all, it is dreadfully boring.

America's last drive-in is shutting its doors forever, but not before putting on one final show: It's Chillerama, featuring four ghoulish tales of terror! Up first, a giant mutant sperm cell goes on a rampage through New York City in WADZILLA! Then, a young teen fights his confusing new urges in I WAS A TEENAGE WEREBEAR. Next, Hitler develops the ultimate killing machine using THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN. Finally, some tainted popcorn turns an entire theater audience into a pack of oversexed zombies in ZOM-B-MOVIE.

It is impossible to pick a favorite here. Literally impossible, because they are all so terrible. Instead of producing a campy satire of the drive-in fodder that was produced over the past forty years, we are given a cheesy spoof, and an idiotic one at that. Each of the stories begin with a silly enough premise, which quickly outlives the humor of the shorts, themselves. Any of the talent that these directors have displayed in the past is lost on CHILLERAMA, and instead traded in for stupid dick and fart jokes. The special effects are meant to imitate the films from these eras, and if looking awful was the goal, they certainly achieved it. While each of the entries drag on indefinitely, Tim Sullivan's gay werewolf musical simply becomes unbearable. He even makes the mistake of hiring his own Scream Queens winner Gabby West, proving once and for all that the show was a sham given her ridiculous performance. Only Joel David Moore succeeds with his hilarious play on Hitler.

CHILLERAMA is a wasted opportunity that will be hard-pressed to find an audience even with the Troma crowds.

The in-between segments which lead to Zom-B-Movie I thought were done well with cool looking effects and gore, and lots of nods to movies like Star Wars, Die Hard and the Goonies. Overall it's a really cool way to waste an hour and a half, clearly this movie was made by people who love B grade horror cinema and it shows. There is some decent female nudity, although it could have used more, and the effects were cool (crappy looking on purpose) this movie is really cool to watch during the fall like I just did. This is the kind of movie that could benefit from a sequel or maybe an extended cut. The two segments I didn't really care for kind of hurt the movie overall for me, had they been stronger this easily would have been a great movie. I like obvious nods and homages paid to Grindhouse and Troma films. If you can get this at a cheap price, it's well worth a viewing.

4686747,4,B005G02LD8,"I watched this Tuesday night as a double bill with Girls Gone Dead on DarrellTV (actually, I purchased both here last month). Chillerama is a cross between Tales from the Crypt amd American Pie. The wrap-around story takes place at a drive-in closing its doors and the individual tales are shown as grindhouse features on the screens; the wrap-around also features multiple subplots from moviegoers and drive-in staff, in which the projectionist is contaminated with a zombie lust virus after digging his wife's corpse up and then spreading the virus to the drive-in patrons. First story is called Wadzilla and has to be seen to be believed (I won't even try to explain the amusement): 5. Second story is my least favorite but was well-crafted; singing and werebears just aren't for me (haha): 4. Third story is in black and white and marries Anne Frank and Frankenstein; Kane Hodder plays the Nazi-built Jewish creature that meows for his first word (I replayed it and laughed even louder...Yes, he said that!); Hitler sings!: 5.

It's like a bad photocopy of a very bad 1980s horror-comedy anthology.

How the filmmakers thought expressing their love for the genre by making what they made simply astonishes me.
None of the movies has any kind of authentic feel, which would have been essential for a combination loving tribute and affectionate parody.

""Funny"" is a very subjective thing, but the only horror to be found is the horrific beating to death of the one-joke premise in each mini-movie. ""See folks? It's a GIANT SPERM! See that? Funny, huh? A GIANT SPERM! Hilarious right? RIGHT?""

This movie consist of four storylines.  An over-all plot is given in between the other three stories.  The overall plot is something similar to a zombie movie, except the zombies seem pervesion-craving rather than brain-craving.  The other three plots consist of giant sperm, homosexual werewolf-like creatures, and a jewish frankenstien.  Well I watched the first short story (the giant sperm) and slowly my doubts grew.  As I watched half of the homo-werebear plot I gave up.  I like cheesy B-rate horror flicks; however, this was simply boring.  The humor was rarely entertaining to me and the plot lines were boring.

In conclusion I wasted $15.  I didn't even finish the movie.  It is rare that I find something I dislike this much. I realize there are many people who will still buy this even though there are bad reviews.  I was one of these people and now I've learned my lesson.  :(  Let my sacrifice not go in vain.",1341187200,2,1036,4.6464088397790055
4686752,3,B005G02LD8,"This one is funny; but it's not really a horror spoof, instead it's a sex spoof/horror spoof or something! It's got great rock music in it though (background tunes). The more homophobic you are though the less you will enjoy this smutty flick. It has tons of gay themes in it and the werebears are s and m gay leather types who shove batts up people. (that's just one story) The first story concerns a giant sperm and lots of masterbating which is sure to offend people. The Hitler building a golem story is obscenely done in bad taste but funny in spite of itself. The sex raping zombies storyline is also beserk and on this unrated version you see tons of private parts exploding. It's perverse and twisted and not for people under 17 by any means. This is a take on old cheesy movies of the drive in era; but they never had this kind of sex and such in them to this degree. It's a aquired taste for sure; with tons of gay slanted humour in it. The picture looks great on blu ray and the extras are decent. This is a movie that I would be careful showing others though!. It's very outlandish.",1340928000,,1094,4.2898550724637685
4686753,3,B005G02LD8,"This aptly named episodic doesn't take itself too seriously--or seriously at all, really.  Its highly inappropriate gross-out humor smacks of Kaufman's Troma films and the more recent, exploitative Tokyo Shock films from Sushi Typhoon.  So don't go watching this with your mother.  The dialogue is littered with poorly executed horror clichs-gone-wrong, blatant sexual innuendo and raunchy harbingers of T'n'A to come.  You know this is going to be awful, but you also know that the filmmakers were intentionally making something awful.  The question is whether or not they succeeded at making something so bad it's good.  Not really.  I laughed here and there, but mostly felt guilty for watching this smut.  I'll say it again just so that you truly understand what this is: filthy SMUT!

This is pure, trashy nonsense.  In the intro scene a man digs up his dead wife to get some ""dead head,"" but he gets more than he bargained for when she zombie-chomps his junk off.  This guy, now penisless, goes to work at a drive-in theater where they'll be showing the other featurettes comprising this movie.  This side-story, Zom-B Movie, continues between and after the featurettes.

Wadzilla is our first featurette and it copies the ""giant monster"" fad of the old days.  It's about an average Joe with abnormally few, large, and sluggish sperm.  After a consult with a doctor at a sperm bank, he agrees to take Spermopropene, a drug which may increase his sperm load.  They make this every bit as idiotic as you'd think they could.  The drug makes his sperm into giant sperm (i.e., two inches of disgustingly inappropriate sperm wriggling across the floor like a slapstick nightcrawler).  The short film continues and his sperm size grows to a foot long.  He literally battles one in a bathroom prior to a blind date.  This rogue sperm grows rapidly, tries to rape a woman, eats a chihuahua and beheads some chick in a sock-hop skirt.  This gamete-gone-wrong gets so big that they use claymation to present it to the tune of Beetlejuice's sandworms.  It continues to kill and grow.  Just as this Wadzilla is humping the sultry Statue of Liberty, which gives us a striptease by the way, General Bukake (Eric Roberts) initiates ""operation money shot"" to save the day.

I Was a Teenage Werebear borrows from the beach movie craze of the 50s and 60s and even has a few painful musical numbers.  This homoerotic tale is initiated after a bite to the butt from a blond, Elvis-ish greaser.  Once aroused, such men transform into plus-sized, unmanscaped beasts.  The make-up for this is utterly terrible.  This is much less entertaining than Wadzilla.  In the end, the recently-turned star of the story slays his maker with a big, chrome...well, you know what...to the...well, you know where.  Just tasteless.  Next to this, Zombie Strippers starts looking like a solid film.

The Diary of Anne Frankenstein is in black and white, and German!  These short films just seem to get worse and worse.  So Adolf Hitler kills the Frank family, shortened from Frankenstein, and steals the journal of Dr. Frankenstein.  Now armed with the secrets of creation, Hitler goes all mad scientist and creates a Jewish Frankenstein played by Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th parts VII-X).  This was funny and the least inappropriate of the shorts.  If you make it this far into the movie, listen for all of the non-German nonsense dialogue.  It's loaded with random movie references--in fact, the whole movie is filled with seriously out of place movie quotables.

After all this, Zom-B Movie comes to its horrendous conclusion with something of an exploitative nymphomaniac zombie orgy complete with necrophilia, sexualized gore and member dismemberment.

This movie, for its style and quality, has a disturbing number of recognizable actors.  It's filmed and scored as if mocking 50s-60s era horror and sci-fi and was clearly made to give exploitation film fans a satirical period piece.",1337212800,,3974,4.987823439878234
4686754,5,B005G02LD8,"I've given this movie a 5 star rating, but I have to admit that it's not for everyone.  Do you like cheesey low budget horror?  Do you think a giant Godzilla sized sperm cell reaking havoc on New York city is good movie making?  Do you think the idea of a 1950's pop musical style movie about a young man getting in touch with his homosexuality via the curse of the Werebear is hilarious?  Can you laugh at subtitled black and white movie about Adolf Hitler making a Jewish Frankenstein?  If the answer to these questions is yes, then buy this movie immeadiately.  You'll be laughing so hard you'll cry.  If you have like minded friends, have them over for some adult beverages and watch it together.  Perfect recipe for a good time.  As far as picture quality goes, these movies are intended to look like old movies, so there's scratches and black specs all over the place, but that's part of the charm.  This is a horror anthology love letter to all those b-movies that could never be as boundary pushing as they wanted to be.  Enjoy!",1335657600,5,1036,4.457446808510638
4686755,3,B005G02LD8,"It's the closing night at the last drive-in in America and the owner has a special treat in store for his customers: a triple feature of rarely seen classics that he was able to get for this special screening. Fans pack the place and we, DVD renters, are able to see the movies as well. Too bad that they qualify for low B-grade movies.

What sounded like a great idea turns out to have few hits and far too many misses. Four current horror feature directors (Adam Rifkin, Joe Lynch, Adam Green and Tim Sullivan) thought this would make a great movie, a collection of short works by each one tied in together with the drive-in motif. Each film has some decent moments but on the whole leave much to be desired.

Surrounding the three features on the big outdoor screen is the story of a man who works at the drive-in who digs up his wife for some necrophilia interaction who finds his intended undead and well and able enough to bite down on his manhood. Thus he becomes infected and as the film moves forward he changes into a full blown (no pun intended) zombie who's infected blood and bite change patrons. What could have been a funny idea relies far too much on sex.

The movies on the screen begin with ""WADZILLA"", the story of a man whose sperm count is so miniscule as to only offer perhaps one sperm per encounter. A scientist offers him a chance to improve himself with a new drug yet to be tested on humans. The result is a super sperm that almost explodes the moment the young man becomes aroused.  When he goes out on a blind date just meeting the young woman puts him into intense pain. Using her bathroom he ""relieves"" himself but the sperm in question escapes, much like the chest burster from ALIEN. It eventually attacks his date who escapes and the two try to stop the sperm without any luck. With each encounter it becomes bigger and bigger until it's the size of, well, Godzilla. Do they finally stop it? I won't give it away but yes, this one involves some gooey special effects and some very off color jokes.

The second film is ""I WAS A TEENAGE WERE-BEAR"". Played out as a tribute to those classic beach films combined with the teenage monster movies, the film has a hero who has yet to have sex with his girlfriend. For some reason he seems more attracted to the tough leather clad bad boys on the beach. Eventually he gets bitten on the behind and discovers to his dismay that he will become a were-bear when the full moon rises. For those who don't know a bear in gay terms is a hairy and full figured male. Can he be accepted for who he is? And is this what he really wants?

The third film in the group is ""THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN"". Yes, it has perhaps the best name of the bunch. In this lost German film we find Hitler discovering the hide out of the Frankenstein family. Not only does he find them but he finds their secret books as well describing how to create a human being. Of course he does so and the result is a definitely Hassidic looking Golem style creation. This movie offers some decent jokes involving the purely made up German sounding language and a number of low budget film making gags. For instance when a German soldier is picked up by the monster and thrown we see a black stand in crash through a table then replaced with the white actor.

As I said in between various characters are infected with the zombie virus and by the end of the last film have gone on a rampage in the drive in. Characters we've met throughout are seen fighting them off and whether or not they survive is in question.

The movie works in some ways but in others it misses completely. The jokes are far too wrapped up in sex and rarely rise above per-teen humor. Yes, the Wadzilla creature is funny as are some of the jokes around it, but when piled one on top of the other they lose their ability to make you laugh.

On the whole fans of B-movies and drive-ins will probably want to take the time to watch this movie. My guess is it would make a great party movie as well. Perhaps it would seem that much funnier if those watching were a little tipsy. It might not be a movie to add to your collection but a single rental would be worthwhile if you're not easily offended.",1332201600,,4208,4.32994923857868
4686756,1,B005G02LD8,"Over-the-top supposed ""horror-comedy"" that tries to make up for its lack of good material by throwing lots of 3-yr old level toilet humor at the viewer in the hopes that he won't notice that there is very little here.  The various installments (shown as fictional drive-in features) have their moments, but each of them, about 20 minutes long apiece, go on about 15 minutes too long, like a good joke that goes stale fast.  As a child, I loved watching the old Adam West ""Batman"" show, but when I saw it again as an adult, I quickly became annoyed at its unsubtle, in-your-face campiness.  This movie reminds me of that experience, with its initial shock-value wearing off far too quickly, while oblivious film-makers carry on laboring under the delusion that what they are doing is ""comedic"" when, in actuality, it devolved into obnoxiousness long ago.  The best one, I thought, was the B@W ""Diary of Anne Frankenstein"", with its mixture of truly bad taste and Hogan's Hero-esque humor.  The '60-ish film look in the initial ""Wadzilla"" feature was well done (better than the actual story).  The cast did a good job, so don't blame them, they aren't script-writers or directors.  For fans of movies like ""Evil Dead 2"" or ""Feast"", don't expect anything here as there is absolutely no attempt to make an actual horror movie, just a miserably failed attempt at comedy.",1330646400,2,1365,4.832618025751073
4686757,5,B005G02LD8,"This movie pays great homage to the old drive in flicks. Like when Grindhouse was released with ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" those movies were intended to have the grimy effect, like the original Grindhouse movies. The over the top bad effects and melodramatic acting is all intended as that is what drive ins produced.  Personally, I think the movie was brilliant as it recapped on styles originated by Hershel Gordon Lewis, John Waters, Ed Wood etc. This is not supposed to be taken seriously by any means but is intended to the viewer, movie buff, to be a homage to some of the most tasteless movies ever made.  Also, let me note that for those who aren't movie buffs in the 50s - 70s , it almost seemed that you were with the in crowd if  you did a tasteless movie, example, ""Pink Flamingos"" ""Attack of The Killer Tomatoes"" ""Blood Feast"" so on and so fourth.  None of these movies had a big budget or academy award winning actors but they have stood the test of time because they are so awful they are good.  Besides the success of how awful but good ""Troll 2"" is, this is perhaps my favorite worst modern movie.

For those interested in seeing this after the rant,  you will see melodramatic performances that are intended to be bad, effects that are intended to look cheap, and toilet humor.  Viewers will be introduced to four stories 1. Wadzilla (a giant sperm) 2. I Was a Teenage Wearbear (a homage piece to beach musical movies with a teenage werewolf feel but it gay oriented so it becomes wearbear.) 3. The Diary of Anne Frankenstein (which is homage to the movies where you had a famous name meet with a monster, example Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein, however the dialog isn't as nice as those old movies) 4. Zom-b-Movie (is a recap on zombie flicks and sleaze, it reminded me of a SNL spoof I saw a long time ago titled, ""Attack of the Masturbating Zombies"".)

In conclusion, this movie isn't for everyone, to start with you have to admire bad taste and if you haven't found the art that bad taste has to offer, start with the master directors I listed above such as John Waters. After watching the classics, I think most haters will enjoy this piece more.  Good work guys on writing and directing this! I watched this before I went into hernia surgery, I was pretty stressed about things going into this procedure and Chillerama entertained me to the point that I was able to relax and forget about the external world for a bit.",1329955200,,2455,4.521444695259594
4686758,1,B005G02LD8,"As a lifelong Horror fan & the producer of two anthologies myself Im very happy to see they are making a comeback. The fact we have a new theatrical horror anthology coming out called Theater of bizarre & and a ton of Horror anthology DVD releases it saddens me that with all the talent in Chillerama it stinks, I think this really gives a good traditional anthology a bad name. Lets face it Great movies Like Creepshow & all the old Amicus anthologies (Tales from the crypt Ect..) can never be touched, What gets me about this film is its really the only new anthology you will find in every Walmart & retail outlet across the country its not just confined to online purchase & indie record stores & i think its a case of well it's got Adam Green & Tim Sullivan as directors so there is a lot of who you know power behind this film with that said here is why i find this film a travesty. First of all its not a fun movie unless you like Troma style toilet humor because thats all this film has to offer, There is a short about a Killer sperm which is the monster on the cover that looks like Aliens deadly spawn. Then we have a short about Gay Werewolves (why) I don't even remember the other short & thats because after the Werewolf segment I was already completely turned off by this film. The best part of this movie is the wrap around scenes. Basically the film takes place in a Drive in and the shorts are what is playing at this drive in. If you wanna see a Great fun & old fashion Horror anthology that just came out I would definitely recommend Midnight Releasings Drive-In Horrorshow A fun Traditional Horror film for all ages which is how it should be. I mean when did Gay werewolves & Killer sperm Wads become scary NEVER its just dumb, this is definitely a trashy Horror comedy that should of been released by Troma, I am mad because like i said this shouldn't be thee most popular new anthology. There are way better ones out there & just because they don't have the Hollywood Power forces of Green & Sullivan behind them doesn't mean they cant be way better then Chillerama is. If you wanna see a great anthology produced recently in the last 2 yrs may I suggest Slices of Life, Drive-In Horror show or another good Horror comedy Nightmare Alley I would avoid this at all costs its not worth it unless you think Killer sperm is cool.",1327104000,2,2348,4.326530612244898
4686759,3,B005G02LD8,"I'm a lifelong Horror fan and when I heard that someone made an anthology for, reportedly, 300K and shot on prosumer cameras, I knew I had to buy it just to support the type of movie making which is lost with today's 150-250 million dollar budgets. Chillerama proves that you don't ned insane budgets to make a movie. But I really wish these guys had worked a bit harder to actually make a good movie. Each of the segments have their moments but Wadzilla is the best with it's perfect reproduction of the look of those old color Technicolor saturated Sci-fi/Horror movies of the 50's and 60's. But Wadzilla and all of the other stories go to far into outright slapstick. I would have liked to have seen a mix up of not only styles but also of tone. It's jokey to the point of being obnoxious.

Speaking of which, co-Director Tim Sullivan (Were-bear) really got on my nerves. Now, I don't want to be called a homophobe for picking on the guy because I've been a big fan of his for years with the writing he did for Fangoria magazine, but he was really irritating. He talks over people and interrupts every other second and when other people are trying to get a word in he starts fidgeting and moving his lips like he's waiting for people to catch a breath so he can interject. He's the reason that I had to turn off the commentary because it got graiting after 15 minutes.

Speaking of the commentary, the idea of showing these guys recording it, in frame, is interesting in theory but the reality is that you just see four guys sitting there and chatting. I think it would also have been better if each Director did their commentary seperately so they could talk in detail about their work without Sullivan interrupting and at the same time letting him natter on about Were-Bear because I did actually want to hear what he had to say about his segment.

The extras were dissapointing, especially since a movie like this relies on DVD and Blu-Ray sales. I bought it on BR and I would have liked to have seen ""making of"" docs on all of the segments but we only got one for Anne Frankenstein that was longer then the actual segement!?! The rest is some deleted scene's and two interviews, from the same convention, and little else. If I just wanted to watch the movie I could have just downloaded it and screwed the moviemakers out of some cash but I paid good money for this because I wanted to see the process and support them.

But if this is what we can expect from Chillerama 2 then they won't be getting another penny from me.",1327017600,,2529,4.420600858369099

4686761,3,B005G02LD8,"Chillerama is a film about a old drive-in movie center that is closing down, so for the final night, the owner is showing a bunch of short horror movies that have never been seen. The film opens with one of the drive-in workers visiting his dead wife to catch up on some good times he never had, only to be infected with a zombie virus. The film introduces a few characters around the drive in, and the workers, then on to the first film WadZilla about a man who has a low sperm count, so his doctor prescribes him a new untested medication that gives the man such a bad side effect that his sperm grows into a Godzilla sized monster. This movie was pretty good, even tho the special effects are laughable, but that was the intention. This film is trying to create some old school style graphics, and they are the best of the worst you can expect.

The next movie WearBears. Where a kid is bitten on the butt by a wearbear only to fight them off and not want to become part of their homosexual-flesh eating gang. It reminds me a lot of a Lost Boys, only set on a beach with musical numbers included. Not one of my favorite parts of this film.

Next up is a black and white feature where Hitler finds Dr Frankenstein's book which he uses to create his own Jewish Frankenstein monster that he attempts to train to kill. This was my least favorite of the features.

Next up is a feature about feces. Doesn't sound like much, and doesn't run very long, but it was the part of the movie I laughed the hardest at. After that is the final act of the movie with a small twist to the end, not much of one, but it closes the film under the title Zombies at the drive in or something along that line.

Overall, fans of Troma, will enjoy this gory comedy in the likes of Kentucky Fried Movie. A couple of different features, thrown into one Grindhouse night of terror... well... laughs more likely, but it is a decent flick that I thought I was not going to enjoy, but I am glad I did watch now. It has definitely become a new favorite of mine for the collection. If you like gross, over the top, gory-camp style humor, then this film is a must see. If you have no sense of humor, and think something like ""Friends"" is the greatest show of them all, then yeah, you will hate this film.

Bonus Features: Of coarse there is an Audio Commentary. It points out a few things about the movie that I Didn't know about. I was quite surprised that Kane Hodder plays the Frankenstein Monster-esq creature in this movie! I didn't know directors and producers from this movie made Hatchet, nor, Detroit Rock City, so it was a surprise to see Kane was apart of this. Also, Kane is very popular with Friday The 13th fans having played Jason quite a few times. Also, during the commentary a nod to Lloyd Kaufman of Troma, I knew they had to be fans!

Wadzilla deleted scenes. Seem to be more extended scenes then anything.

The Making of the Diary of Anne Frankenstein. A few behind the scenes and interviews about the making of this segment. Including interviews with Kane Hodder.

I was a Teenage Wearbear, a behind the scenes, deleted scenes and trailer to the short film.

Zom-B-Movie deleted and extended scenes.

A couple of comic-con interviews with the 4 directors, and a couple of trailers to this film that I think might have been made souley for this DVD as a bit of a joke. Either that, or they where just meant to reveal most of the movie in the trailers like old fashioned trailers.

Overall the bonus content is great for those of us who want to see and learn more about the film we loved, but, if you hated it, then why did you even wanna know what bonus content was on this?",1326585600,,3664,4.318777292576419

4686763,2,B005G02LD8,"Edited for reposting on Amazon. For unedited full length version please visit Shivers of Horror (link in profile) my horror movie/book review blog

The movie starts off with a guy digging up his dead wife. She's mummified and he's drinking and complaining about never getting his ""needs"" fulfilled. So he whips out his you know what for a little ""dead head"" and she comes to life and bites it off. The guy wonders off through a Drive-in showing a bunch of ""splatter"" films. There we meet a few different characters. Between each movie showing at the drive-in we are taken back to a few of these characters for their wrap-around zombie story.

The first story begins with ""Wadzilla"". The story of a guy who attempts to donate sperm but is turned down because he only ever shoots out one, and its sluggish. The Dr (Ray Wise) gives him an experimental drug to help him out with his problem. The medication has bad results however. Every time he gets aroused his sperm enlarges so its super painful. He's told to stop taking the medication, and every time he feels pain to quickly masturbate and get the sperm out of him. Of course, he keeps getting aroused and his sperm keep getting bigger and bigger and eventually one takes over New York....

This one had that ""old drive-in"" look too it. It wasn't crisp quality like one would think from a BluRay DVD. But seeing as how its an ""old"" movie people are watching at a drive-in that's to be expected.

Next up is ""I was a Teenage Werebear"". This one starts out with a teen and a girl getting it on in a van. The two teens break into song...which was really funny, because it reminded me of Grease a little before they even started singing and I wasn`t expecting a musical at all from this film. Anyhow, these three guys show up, they look like a toss up of some 50s greasers and BSDM bondage homosexuals. The whole vibe of them in the first 5 minutes from being on screen was like a mix between the T-Birds (again from Grease) and The Lost Boys (they use some lines from that movie actually, so my feeling was correct). When the ""werebears"" get pissed off they morph into guys in leather with wolf faces. The musical aspect of the story was funny..especially the ""love bit me on the a**"" part. But if your looking for people who can sing, don't expect much.

This one looked crisp and clear, exactly what you'd expect from a BluRay DVD. This one was really done in the style of those 60s beach musical films, and while it was entertaining to me quickly became boring by the end.

Next up was ""The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"", I honestly thought I'd love this segment because its Adam Green's and Kane Hodder is in it. But I was extremely disappointed that I had to read subtitles for the entire thing. If I wanted to read subtitles I'd watch a foreign movie. Because of this, I lost interest FAST...in fact, I had to stop the movie briefly (which I hate doing when I'm going to be reviewing it, but it was out of my control unfortunately) and I just dragged on getting back to it because I didn't want to finish this segment.

Anyhow, the basic plot to this one is that the Nazi's find Anne Frank and her family and kill them. They get a book with the instructions on how to make ""Frankenstein's Monster"" as the Franks were really Frankenstein's. So, they build a monster who looks like a mesh between a rabbi and Frankenstein's monster.

This one was sorta done with that ""backyard"" feeling. Not so much the acting. But the concept of the story. It took a serious subject matter (Nazi's, Anne Frank, and Hitler) and made a comedy out of it. So those that might be offended shouldn't watch. You had scenes where it was obviously a set, or an actor was replaced by another actor for a minute and then switched back. While this was all done on purpose. I just did not like this story at all.

""Deathication"", it's the last ""movie"" playing at the drive-in. I briefly read another review midway through watching this, and someone said they had to skip over it because it was so disgusting. Of course that just made me more curious because the rest of the movie hadn't been gross at all...

In the beginning of this ""segment"" there is a warning...and well, you can kinda guess what's coming based on the title and what they talk about...defecation. This isn't really a ""story"" within the movie, its more like the beginning of a bunch of random clips of people taking craps on sidewalks, exploding on walls, dogs eating it, etc etc. If you have a weak stomach, this isn't for you, but its over pretty quickly. If you like poo humor, you'll probably find it quite funny. While this plays on the Drive-in screen we get taken back to the characters at the drive-in and the whole Zombie wrap-around storyline which ends the film.

The main zombie storyline was entertaining and fun for the brief period of time it took place during, and I really enjoyed all the characters. I liked the whole concept of having an anthology horror film take place at a theater or drive-in and have the wrap around storyline.

On top of all the quotes from other movies, there are TONS of cameos. Some I even see listed in the credits and have no idea where they were in the movie. Kane Hodder, Ron Jeremy, Ray Wise, etc. So be on the lookout for those.

Bottom line on this movie, if your expecting a serious horror film. Keep looking, this one is NOT it. I honestly probably won't be watching this one again, but hey at least I can say I've seen it now and for what it was, it was actually entertaining for the most part. Given the average overall rating of each segment, and the fact that I don`t normally like B-horror films, I'd probably give this one a 2.5/5 stars total because at least I was somewhat entertained.",1324080000,4,5738,4.463740458015267
4686764,4,B005G02LD8,"Personally I've grown quite weary of all these homage/throwback style grindhouse films that have been coming out over the last few years.  Every now and again a decent one comes through, but for me it's like watching a tribute band-It may be decent, but all it really makes you want to do is see the real band.
Chillerama is another one of these of course, and it really wears it's influences on it's sleeve.  It's a full on comedy, and aimed solely at exploitation/horror junkies like myself.  Not that you have to be horror fanatic to appreciate this film, but you will definitely catch most of the references, homages and jokes if you are.  Just like you don't have to be a James Bond fan to enjoy the Austin Powers films, but it helps immensely.  The humor is mainly of the crude sexual variety-Definitely a What-Can-We-Get-Away-With approach.  Many reviewers compare this to Troma, and that's a fair comparison, though I'd say that Troma is still the undisputed king of pushing the limits of sex/violence and bad taste.
Chillerama, in the Creepshow and Amicus Pictures tradition, is an anthology film(remember those?).  It's four stories by four newschool horror directors(though Adam Rifkin has been around for awhile now).  The film takes place in a drive-in theater on it's last night before it's torn down.  Three ""lost"" horror films are being shown, and we watch those three films with the audience.
The first is WADZILLA by Adam Rifkin, and arguably the best one.  A nerdy guy takes an experimental drug to increase sperm volume and before you know it there's a gigantic sperm terrorizing New York.  This film takes place in the 50s and is an homage to the giant monsters on the rampage movies of that time.  However, the look and style of the film seems to be more in the vein of horror films from the 70s and early 80s.  A kind of two for one deal, and a very good homage on both counts.
The second film is I WAS A TEENAGE WEREBEAR by Tim Sullivan.  This is story set in the early 60s about a guy who is struggling with the fact that he might be homosexual.  He's not so much interested in his girlfriend as he is in the local gang of leather clad bad boys.  When he's bitten by the James Dean-esque leader of the gang(the two sidekicks look like they stepped out of the Blue Oyster Bar from the Police Academy movies), he becomes a gay werewolf-A Werebear!!  He refuses to join the fold however.  Kind of a gay Lost Boys if you will.  This film is less an homage to horror as it is an homage to both teenage 50s films like Rebel Without A Cause and the Beach Party films of the 60s.  There are even a few musical numbers.
This is the episode that gets the most heat from reviewers.  While I agree that it is the weakest link here, I don't share the animosity towards it.  It is actually a good homage to the genres it's spoofing, it's just that it probably doesn't belong in this movie as it's really the odd one out and throws off the momentum.
Then there's Adam Green's DIARY OF ANNE FRANKENSTEIN.  This is about Hitler obtaining Anne Frank(enstein)'s grandfather's diary, which of course contains the secrets of creating life from the dead.  Hitler creates his own hulking brute to help him take over the world.  Green did a great job on this homage to films of the 30s.  It's all in ""German"" with English subtitles.  The ""German"" here is impressively and humorously improvised instead of being actual German.  The 30s look is fantastic, and the slapstick buffoonery of Hitler is like many of the American films and cartoons of that era that poked fun of him.  Great stuff.
A fourth film called DEATHICATION is set to show, but is interrupted by the proper fourth film, ZOM-B-MOVIE, which is the wraparound story about a zombie invasion at the drive-in showing the CHILLERAMA.  We only see the first few minutes of DEATHICATION, but it's a hilarious collection of poop themed carnage.  Definitely the most TROMA-esque.
In ZOM-B-MOVIE by Joe Lynch, all the drama we've been experiencing with the characters at the drive-in comes to a head when the zombie outbreak begins(the prologue shows how this infestation begins), and the characters find themselves fighting for their lives....and virginity.  The zombies aren't so much here to eat them(though they certainly do), but to.....you know what!
It's a decent story, also quite TROMA-esque, but honestly I'm sick of zombies.  With zombies having become so commercialized and becoming the Star Trek of the horror genre in recent years(along with vampires), I don't care if I ever see another zombie movie again.  I'm so desensitized to it, zombies just don't do anything for me anymore(I never thought I'd ever say those words).
So, while Chillerama may not be perfect on all accounts, I think horror fans will find quite a bit here to eat up and enjoy.  Plus it's really reassuring to see modern horror film directors keeping their love for classic horror and exploitation alive.  A great love letter to the drive-in era that we horror fans all love so much.  I'm glad this film was made and I'm glad to have watched it.",1323993600,24,5086,4.661434977578475
4686765,4,B005G02LD8,"Chillerama is sort of a spoof of the movie Grindhouse, even though it's far shorter. And like many have said, it is very Troma-esque. There is a lot of scatalogical humor, and there is even one segment called ""Deathification"" that shows a lot of fecal matter. There is also a ton of gore in Chillerama. And ex gay porn star Brent Corrigan stars in the segment ""I Was A Teenage Werebear"". Chillerama isn't perfect, but if you are a fan of b-movies that push the envelope of bad taste, it is a lot of fun!",1323648000,4,503,4.3052631578947365
4686766,1,B005G02LD8,"A lot of people reviewing this film are defending it by saying it's just like TROMA or movies from the 50's - 60's. Well what I say to you is I like those films I just don't think this film is any good period. I don't care what feeling they are going for.. its just plain bad. Basically what they do is create an anthology with movies that would have come out in the 50's, 60's or in the case of ""The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"" the 30's and just throw in a bunch of ludicrous TROMA jokes. If you have ever met someone who tries to be really funny and just come off as being annoying that is this movie in a nutshell only luckily you can actually avoid that entirely by just not watching the film at all.

The plot is pretty straight forward really. There is a wrap-around story called ""Zom-B-Movie"" that takes place at the Chillerama where they are showing 4 different movies. Yes some of the reviews here left out the worst film of them all ""Deathication"" probably because it doesn't play all the way through because the reel gets knocked off. But the other films are ""Wadzilla"", a take off on Godzilla and the Blob, ""I Was a Teenage Were-Bear"", basically a beach musical from the 60's, and lastly ""The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"", which is just a rip on classic monster movies. None of which have any kind of redeeming value.

The sad thing about this film however is how much real talent is behind this film that was entirely wasted. Joe Lynch (Wrong Turn 2), Adam Green (Hatchet, Frozen), Tim Sullivan (Driftwood, 2001 Maniacs) and Adam Rifkin. These guys are really great directors who completely wasted there time on this effort which could have been used making a real decent ""Tales of the Crypt"" style anthology. How often does talent like this get together to make a movie? Not often due to conflict in schedules and all other kinds of things. So if you are a fan of these guys and this movie piqued your interest.. do some research before watching it. If you don't like TROMA, don't even think about checking this one out. It is definitely an acquired taste.",1323561600,6,2069,4.45646437994723
4686767,3,B005G02LD8,"Don't get me wrong I watch troma movies (and the import and 80s stuff) all the time heck I own a bunch as well and not just the toxic avenger stuff.  The thing is that the humor has to work to pull it off...while this anthology has decent humor it's not as funny as it should be.  It's definitely watchable but you won't watch it all the time like some similar movies.

And...I don't know how you do this movie without a cameo from michael biehn or michael ironside.  Unfortunately eric roberts only makes a small cameo, guess he was busy wrangling the sharktopus.",1323561600,,564,4.394230769230769

8470876,5,B005G02LD8,"I only really want to talk about ""I was a Teenage Wearbear."" I loved it. It is funny, it is well paced, and it is very insightful. The movie looks at a Gay teen (played by the no longer teenage, but amazingly attractive Sean Lockhart/Brent Corrigan) who, in a 1962 beach movie, has to deal with the fact that he doesn't really have any interest in his attractive girlfriend, but is very attracted to a young man in leather. Unfortunately, this attraction leads to a bite on his behind that transforms him into a 'Wearbear.'

The question our hero has to confront is whether to become a nihilistic violent outcast, or find some way to be Gay and stay in society. The question is not fully resolved, of course, but we are left to think he will tend to the latter.

The whole thing tends to a combination of Schlock and Camp, which works. From the Rebel without a Cause costume of our protagonist to the votive icons of JFK, the period gets recalled with irony and a certain affection, but the underlying hostility of the time is more than hinted at, our hero is bullied and the ones who seem initially best able to deal with the harassment are violent monsters.

Every Gay kid should watch this with his Dad.",1473552000,,1206,4.447963800904978
