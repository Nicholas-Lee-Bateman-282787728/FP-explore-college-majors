8055460,1,B00082ZRQC,"I don't hat it, but it is damaged or the first part of the DVD did not record; therefore, unwatchable.  Please tell me how to return it.",1411171200,,136,4.037037037037037
8055461,4,B00082ZRQC,"Dick Jones as ""Buffalo Bill Jr."" delivers his fights and stunts with gusto, with the help form his sister Calamity. Don't expect Gunsmoke-like plots, though. This is a TV Western for KIDS of all ages. Out of the four episodes on this DVD only one is kinda grainy. The last one features a very young Angie Dickinson in a supporting role along with George Lewis. A treat.",1125100800,6,369,4.522388059701493
