8139648,5,B000HEWH14,"These 3 episodes of NOVA are super!  I'm a big astronomy/cosmology fan and collect good DVDs on the subject.  ""Death Star"" I've seen over and over again and just love it - what a super documentary.  But all 3 are really superb - immensely enjoyable and VERY informative and educational. I can't recommend this more.",1297728000,,315,4.6909090909090905
8139649,5,B000HEWH14,"This is a box set of three of the best NOVA PBS science documentary series episodes on astronomy and cosmology.  From 1987 is Death of a Star, my favorite NOVA episode of all time!  This follows the discovery of supernova 1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud by an astronomer in Chile.  Although the science is pretty old by now, it is a great episode for showing the voyage of science discovery that can be so exciting.  The footage of astronomer Stirling Colgate getting so excited he can't speak is priceless.  The DVD transfer is not that good, I would give it a 5 on a 10 scale, but perhaps this could not be helped because of the age. 4:3 format.

Contrast this with The Runaway Universe from 2000, letterboxed, which is also mostly about supernova research.  But instead of glass photographic plates and astronomers tripping over telescopes we see astronomers glued to monitor screens and talking via video microwave link to other astronomers miles away.  HOWEVER, the graphics on this episode are superb, as good as it gets without going High-Definition.  There is one especially good sequence where the animation ""flies"" us through the Milky Way galaxy past Messier objects most amateur astronomers will recognize instantly.  There is also a great view of our Local Group of galaxies.  I would rate the transfer here a 9/10 at least.  The human story is not as compelling as Death of a Star, but the scientific story is just as interesting.

The third episode in the troika is Death Star from 2002.  This episode deals with the only thing in the universe that can compete with supernovas as far as energy is concerned (with the possible exception of my ex-girlfriend Maria), and that is gamma-ray bursters.  These dying stars emit gamma rays so powerful they sterilize all life for dozens of light-years out into space.  This episode is also a detective story as astronomers try to figure out how these objects can emit so much radiation, and whether they are located inside or outside our galaxy.  The transfer to DVD here is excellent, I would rate it 8/10 at least.  Letterbox.

These three make a great collection of Nova astronomy episodes.  To make your collection even better, consider adding The Monster of the Milky Way, a recent Nova episode just released on DVD.",1169942400,38,2281,4.8
