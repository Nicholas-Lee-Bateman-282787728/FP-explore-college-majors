390080,4,6301964179,"Although it lacks the sharp edge of the original, AFTER THE THIN MAN is a worth sequel to THE THIN MAN, with the famous William Powell and Myrna Loy chemistry as intoxicating as one of Nick Charles' famous cocktails.
The sequel finds Nick and Nora Charles newly returned to their home in San Francisco in the wake of Nick's successful handling of ""the thin man"" case--only to find Norah's formidable aunt Katherine determined to keep the family name out the papers re cousin Selma's wayward husband, who has been missing for several days.  Nick is accordingly summoned to track him down as discreetly as possible.  But where Nick and Norah go, both murder and publicity is sure to follow.
AFTER THE THIN MAN boasts a cast equal to the original, most notably a young James Stewart as cousin Selma's former love, Jessie Ralph as Aunt Katherine, and a truly delightful Penny Singleton as Polly, the hard-knocks cabaret singer who leads wealthy husbands astray.  The story is a bit convoluted, but the complications never get in the way of the film's witty dialogue, and while many may find the killer a bit obvious it doesn't prevent the film from being a great deal of fun.  Recommended.",1009584000,5,1185,4.765853658536585
390081,5,6301964179,"The first ""Thin Man"" was great, but ""After the Thin Man"" is better.  William Powell and Myrna Loy, as Nick and Nora Charles, are the archetypical sophisticated couple.  No one since has come close.  Great casting of the supporting roles fills the story exquisitely.  Wow, could those old studios serve up wonderful acting from all kinds of characters!  My favorite is Aunt Katherine, the battle axe to end all battles axes, played by Jessie Ralph; and Henry, the rickety old butler played by, would you believe, Tom Ricketts.
As usual, the dialogue sparkles.  And the story is great:  a nice Dashiell Hammett whodunit with a not too complicated plot, that leads to a surprise ending.  Don't miss the encounter between Nick and Nora's family.  It's priceless!",988588800,5,758,4.9523809523809526
390082,4,6301964179,"This was the second in the series featuring the great film team of William Powell and Myrna Loy, again starring as Nick and Nora Charles, the couple who seem to have a way with getting mixed up in murder.  The mystery itself is quite complicated, but it basically surrounds the murder of Nora's cousin's husband, although his murder is only the first.  The mystery is fun to follow (and not easy to figure out, although my hunch proved right).  But the terrific dialogue and rapport between Powell and Loy matches the mystery, and even their dog, Asta, has some hilarious scenes as well.  The supporting cast of Elissa Landi, James Stewart, and many familiar character actors are also good.  I can't compare this to the other Thin Man movies, having not scene all of them, but I'm sure this must be one of the best and fans of mysteries and this great film team will definitely want to catch this movie.",972172800,4,903,4.583850931677019
390213,4,6301964179,"This is the 1936 sequel to the original Thin Man Movie.  The setting is San Francisco as opposed to New York.  The holiday is New Years as opposed to Christmas.  William Powell and Myrna Loy co star once again.  The movie features a very early role for James Stewart.

The movie is very witty.  I tend not to like sequels.  This movie is an exception and I like it better than the original Thin Man movie.  The two movies do not really depend on each other and this movie can be viewed as a stand alone movie.

The movie is dated in style.  Primarily I enjoy it as a piece of Hollywood History.  As is true for many movies from this period there is some ethnic stereotyping that a modern viewer may find not consistent with their values.  Thank You...",1514764800,,751,4.285714285714286

390360,5,6301964179,"I really enjoy ""The Thin Man"" movies, with the exception of the last one in the series. ""After The Thin Man"" however, is a delight to watch. Nick and Nora arrive home to San Francisco on New Year's Eve day with plans to disconnect the phone as well as the doorbell and sleep through it all. Of course, that plan is shot from the moment they open their door. Someone is throwing a party at their house to welcome them home. While trying to figure out how this happened, they get a phone call from Nora's cousin, Selma, begging her and Nick to come to dinner later that evening because she desperately needs their help. Of course, Nora and Selma's old hag of an aunt, Aunt Katherine gets into the act. Nick can't stand Katherine and frankly, Nora isn't all that fond of her either but of course they go anyway. It seems Selma's playboy husband has disappeared (this is a frequent thing with him) not to mention there are suspicions that said hubby, Robert, is cheating on Selma. Suffice it to say, Robert gets himself killed and there is no shortage of suspects. From the brother of a man Nick put in prison, to a gangster club owner, to Robert's mistress, who is the songbird at the club to even Selma's psychiatrist, everyone is a suspect. And the Charles' are smack dab in the middle of it all. Absolute hilarity and craziness is the name of the game here.  Keep a look out for James Stewart as David, Selma's (once) fiance as well as ""Mrs. Asta."" the mate of Asta, of course!",1484006400,2,1477,4.410256410256411

390413,5,6301964179,"After the wild success of The Thin Man there had to be a sequel. It was smart of MGM to make the sequels infrequent and not cheapen it by turning it into a serial with yearly installments. After the Thin Man is a true continuation of the first film, taking place the same holiday week though beginning on New Year's Eve and not Christmas Eve, as Nick and Nora arrive home to find a party going on full swing at their San Francisco house, even though no one there seems to recognize them. Bon Vivants that they are, they don't seem to mind so much, but a call summoning them to snobby Aunt Katherine's house changes everything. A nervous cousin Selma implores the Charles's to find her husband who has been missing for three days and soon they are knee deep in mystery and murder.

This second Thin Man film is almost as good as the first, though there's not as much fun and comedic moments between Nick and Nora themselves. I suppose the writers (Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett), who did the first three, felt they had introduced them in the first film and now they were established characters. The usual bunch of suspects are introduced as the story progresses, either associated with the Ly-Chee, a Chinatown night club or Nora's family. This ends as the first did, in what would be the established method of the series, as the police gather up the suspects and bring them together for Nick to present his story of events and cross-examine the entire group until the guilty one cracks (a device that would be used frequently in a one-on-one basis in courtroom dramas).

Of course someone does and things end up well enough for all. The atmosphere is helped by an especially foggy San Francisco setting. In the meantime we have been introduced to an unexpected character, Mrs. Asta, who, it is daringly hinted, may have indulged in some infidelity while Mr. Asta was away in New York. Another unexpected development is revealed at the very end, one which would have future repercussions for the series and of which some would disapprove.",1477008000,,2043,4.6565096952908585

390431,5,6301964179,The Best.,1464393600,,9,4.0
390432,4,6301964179,"The original ""The Thin Man"" movie was based on the title Dashiell Hammett detective novel, and it played itself more for its humorous aspects than as a serious mystery. The idea evidently worked, for this started a series of ""Thin Man"" movies which were not based on any Hammett stories, with the comic adventures of Nick and Nora doing detective work.

In this run, Nick and Nora have come back from New York to California on New Year's, hoping to relax but instead being treated to a surprise party, and then having to meet Nora's aristocratic and snooty relatives. Unfortunately Nora's cousin Selma's husband has disappeared (as he had done before), and begs Nick and Nora to find him. Reluctantly, they do so. They find him quickly, alive and well, at a local club, but the problems, and the story, are only beginning as the husband is murdered, and Nick and Nora unearth some criminal intrigues...

The story is played basically for laughs, though there is violence, danger, and tension. There are jokes about 3 am breakfasts and drinking lots of alcohol and smoking, and the dog Asta gives Nick and Nora trouble rather than provides help...and the very end of the story has a cute twist to it. It's entertaining more than anything else, but enjoyable if you like it.",1463961600,,1272,4.751131221719457

390475,5,6301964179,"I know it's now the ass end of the Yuletide season, but we can't just suddenly kick all holiday movies to the curb, can we? Case in point, 1936's AFTER THE THIN MAN, second of the six Thin Man movies that so successfully partnered up William Powell and Myrna Loy. It's a murder mystery what begins on New Year's Eve and pits Nick and Nora Charles (Powell, Loy) against a wide array of suspects. So what else is new?

If I suss out the timeline correctly, AFTER THE THIN MAN picks up where THE THIN MAN leaves off, with Nick and Nora on a train bound home from New York to Frisco just in time for New Year's Eve, with Nick still basking in the glow of his brilliant detecting in the Thin Man case. There's them droves of reporters waiting whilst the Charles(es) disembark, hurling questions at our man of the hour, with Nick protesting that he's retired, so retired, from crime-solving. Nora merely looks at him askance, as only someone with Myrna Loy's exquisite, expressive features could.

Nick and Nora would prefer to chill for New Year's in the peace and the quiet of their home. Only, Nora's cousin Selma's husband's gone missing, and never mind that that cad's done a bunk before, faithless spouse that he is. And, so, off go the Charles(es) to spend New Year's Eve hobnobbing with a catalogue of unsavory characters, some of 'em the mean, low dregs of society, some of 'em posh and entitled. And because MGM ain't about to waste a Thin Man mystery on just a missing husband, the plot soon enough escalates to muuuurder.

The Thin Man films made Powell and Loy my favorite all-time male and female actors, and LIBELED LADY only cemented my preference. MGM was keen to reunite this sizzling screen couple as Nick and Nora and even sprung for a generous budget. All the pleasing components from the first Thin Man picture recur, from Nick's run-ins with society's fishier elements to Nora's resolve to be in on the action to Nick's outsmarting the goons and the flatfoots to the climactic denouement in which the unflappable Nick gathers all the suspects in the drawing room, starts breaking down the case, and waits for someone to make a mistake. Another on-point screenplay prescribes a healthy dose of caustic wit and sharp humor (excepting Asta's antics that I never found all that funny, sorry).

As ever, there is the art deco cool; there are the ritzy nightclub scenes. Jimmy Stewart co-stars in an early role as a man whose pining for Nora's cousin goes very much unrequited. Even back then, Stewart's got his likable everyman part down pat. To be honest, the mystery arc - well-orchestrated as it is - doesn't interest me as much as do those intimate moments shared by Loy and Powell. Probably it's my bias talking, but I challenge anyone to come up with another screen couple what's got superior chemistry with each other. I love that Nick and Nora take such delight in each other and pay such close attention to what the other is doing, almost to the exclusion of everyone else in the room. Some folks even say AFTER THE THIN MAN is better than the first movie. Maybe so. Maybe I like the original better just because it IS the original. The ensuing four films won't be as good as these first two, mostly because them studio suits or maybe the Hays Code decided it's best to domesticate Nick and Nora. Thus, the closing moment of AFTER THE THIN MAN shouldn't be met with familial bliss but, rather, with quickening dread and much screaming and pulling out of hair.",1452384000,,3480,4.608064516129033

390555,5,6301964179,"Truly torn over which of the Thin Man movies is my favorite. One day it's this one, the next that one, and so on and so forth - for years in an endless personal debate.

Not going to try and pretend that they're all favorites. Clearly the third film in the series, ""Another Thin Man"", falls into the 'okay' category. And oddly enough, even the original film doesn't quite get the multiple repeat viewings that the others have seen on the evolution of TVs and monitors I've owned over the decades.

However, just based on a guesstimate view count, 'After' is likely to be tops in my library. Over the years I've probably screened this film more than three hundred times. Not an exaggeration. Thank goodness for DVDs, because I literally burned through two old VHS cassettes.

In this, their second pairing, Nick and Nora and are back in San Francisco. Their sensational ""Thin Man Case"" exploits in New York have the local press salivating at the prospect that Nick will dig up somebody's dirty laundry for the west coast. He and Nora laugh it off saying that he's fully retired. They're adamant: No more adventures. Period.

It's New Year's Eve and events are about to unfold that will ensnare our couple in ways they could never have foreseen.

Interestingly, we're introduced to Nora's ber wealthy family. Its matriarch is the bombastic Aunt Katherine, superbly played by character actress Jessie Ralph. Among her many very aged relations - one stands out. The only young person is her cousin Selma Landis.

She's had it tougher than Nora, having been forced to live out a cloistered existence with a gaggle of judgmental senior citizens. Her only relief was short-lived: Marrying a worthless playboy who took vows for the money alone. It wasn't too long after the honeymoon that he returned to his scandalous roots. And despite years of mistreatment and disrespect - she clings onto Robert like a lone life preserver in an endless open ocean.

However, the preserver itself will need preservation, because this night will be his last on Earth.

But before that terrible justice is meted out - she enlists her cousin and her former cop husband to find him. Missing for three days, she's literally going out of her mind with fear. Despite everyone knowing that Robert is a no-good p.o.s. likely up to some no-good shenanigans, Nick and Nora agree to search for the wayward spouse.

So begins a tale of blackmail, revenge, and murder.

The bodies keep piling up as Nick starts to suspect much more than the death of a shiftless husband is on hand. A hidden game is being played with rules he doesn't know - with game pieces that are constantly dodging his keen scrutiny. What he does know is that mysterious strangers keep shooting at him, nefarious dark stalkers are throwing stones in the middle of the night, and he hasn't gotten one hour of sleep in nearly two days!

Even poor Asta is having to fight his own dark nemesis. During his absence a naughty Scottish Terrier has been making moves on Mrs. Asta. And when he returns from The Big Apple, is shocked to see a non-Wire Fox Terrier in amongst his kids!

One of the true classics. A genuine gem of a film that I will never tire of and which will go with me to the end of my time.

Personal Notes:

- Not sure if the part was written that way or she improvised (I suspect the latter) Jessie Ralph as Nora's controlling aunt displays her barely veiled contempt for Nick by addressing our hero in a *hilariously* incorrect phonetic misinterpretation of his given name. Not Nicholas as one would expect - but ""Nick-O-LAHSSS"". To which our man grudgingly accepts without complaint; prevented from striking back for his wife's sake.

I mention this for two reasons.

First, because it's freakin' funny! :-D

Second, because Jessie Ralph, Myrna Loy, and William Powell actually worked together on a previous production. One of the non-Thin Man films which teamed Powell & Loy was ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evelyn-Prentice/dp/B001N3P6M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evelyn Prentice</a>"" filmed three years previous (1934). And it's in that movie that I believe the trio became steady friends. Explaining Ms. Ralph's scene-stealing deprecating manner toward the stars of ATTM. Something a stock studio character actor would never do if they wanted to work in the future.

In fact, the three would again find themselves entangled with one another in yet another film. A wonderful light rom-com from 1938 - ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Wedding/dp/B000Q7ZLUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Wedding</a>"" also starring Sidney Toler in a pre-Charlie Chan role.

- Gotta give props to another wondrous character actor: Sam Levene as beleaguered SFPD Lieutenant Abrams.

I'm a monster fan of the man! During the 1930's, he was often cast as the high-strung police officer whose constant irritants were three-fold in many of his movies: 1) Having to correct people about his rank, which was always Lieutenant. 2) Repeatedly berating his junior officers to stop dillydallying or removing themselves from his personal space. 3) Being the butt of sarcasm, whereupon Sam would produce his famously hilarious double-take.

Check out ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mad-Miss-Manton/dp/B0029BK1PW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mad Miss Manton</a>"" with Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda for more of Sam's funny goofy schtick mannerisms.

Or even better, the fourth in the Thin Man series - ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow/dp/B0009GX1C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">'Shadow'</a>"".",1428019200,,5693,5.330357142857143

390653,4,6301964179,"Enjoying the success of the original ""Thin Man,"" William Powell and Myrna Loy team up again as Nick and Nora Charles.  After solving a murder while on vacation in New York City in the first film, the couple return to their home in San Francisco, hoping to spend some quiet time as the year comes to a close.  Nick, now semi-retired thanks to the fortune he married into, is still quick with the quips and just as fast come Nora's retorts.

The matriarch of Nora's aristocratic and stuffy family requests that she and Nick come to dinner.  Much is made up to this point of Nick's everyman status with the ruffians about town.  Surprisingly, Nora feels just as comfortable.  Nick, on the other hand, isn't too fond of Nora's family, especially Aunt Katherine (Jessie Ralph).  Katherine has summonsed the couple as Nora's cousin Polly (billed as Dorothy McNulty but later known as Penny Singleton from the ""Blondie"" films) has seemingly misplaced her philandering husband Robert (Alan Marshal).  It turns out he is working with a club singer (Elissa Landi) and her boss, `Dancer' (Joseph Calleia) to extort $25K from Polly's former beau, David (James Stewart).

When Robert turns up shot to death, suspects are aplenty.  And Polly is at the top of the list seen running after Robert, pistol in hand.  With the police seemingly befuddled, Nick takes charge and as you might expect, cracks the case.  The journey is an enjoyable one.  The sets are great, but these movies are truly about Powell and Loy's seemingly extemporaneous banter.  One of the best lines comes when Nick exclaims to Nora, ""let's get something to eat, I'm thirsty.""  As usual the booze flows freely in these dramedies.

Nick & Nora Charles (William Powell & Myrna Loy) are quite a team, he's a retired drinking detective that loves his drink and she's a well-to-do socialite.  Nora is always talking Nick into getting involved with the murders that happen, Nick luvs to take Astor (his protector, lol) with him when he's looking for clues.  Nick is always charming and polite and Nora is always the prodding loving wife.

This is an entertainingly fun movie the 2nd in 5 of the series.  William and Myrna share such rare chemistry on screen you can just feel the emotions coming thru the screen, you would believe that they were truly in a loving marriage to each other.

They were filmed during the depression and provided much needed escape for anyone who could afford the 10 cents or whatever denomination required to enter the theater. The evening would also include free dishes to women in attendance, a newsreel, one or two cartoons, the ""A"" movie and a ""B"" movie. Sigh.",1399507200,,561,4.509803921568627
390660,4,6301964179,"Long before Jaws, long before Halloween X, long before Oceans X  Hollywood has cashed in on sequelling any film idea that showed the least bit of staying power. One of the early example of that trend was the five (I believe) run Thin Man series starring William Powell, Myra  and of course their faithful dog Asta. While the subsequent four after the initial fairly straightforward film adaptation of Dashiell Hammetts classic crime detection novel The Thin Man running from the mid-1930s into the early 1940s are a mixed bag the film under review here, After The Thin Man, except for a bit too much length and confusing filler is one of the better ones.

No question that every crime detection novel (and film noir ) aficionado owes Dashiell Hammett (and Raymond Chandler) a great debt for providing us with professional private detectives we can get behind and root for after a long run of amateur Saturday afternoon parlor detectives was snapped in the late 1920s and 1930s. Hammetts Sam Spade may be the max daddy of all the tough private no question  but Hammetts more measured attempt to mix a plebian ex-copper Nick Charles and patrician, meaning the one with the dough, Nora (with Asta thrown in) to solve the hard city murders that they wound up solving is interesting as well. Those sleuthing virtues are more apparent in the book than on the various film adaptations but with the exception of the over-the-top use of liquor to loosen up old Nick and Noras brains the pains-taking crime detection methodology behind the facile faade come through.

Take this last case, the one under review, and the one that begs the question about being careful with jilted lovers listed in the title of this piece. There is murder about in old Frisco town where the Charles had been based at one time and the place where Noras Mayfair swells money and family reside. Seemed that one of Noras female cousins married a neer-do-well male gold-digger who was putting the squeeze for twenty-five grand on that cousins ex-boyfriend who was still madly in love with her (played by a young Jimmy Stewart by the way). The reason for the squeeze was that that neer-do-well was playing footsies with a torch singer down at one of the better gin joints in town. Problem is said footsie-player was working with the nefarious gangster-type club-owners to do our gigolo out of his ill-gotten gains after the ex-boyfriend ponies up the dough.

There is a bigger problem when our gigolo is found face down with a bullet in his back and it looks like his Brahmin wife (Noras cousin) was going to take the big step-off for it up at Q or wherever they throw female murderers. Enter Nick and Nora after a tiring night of New Years Eve nightclubbing to save day. It looked bad for several parties since we know that scorned wife was not taking the fall, not in Frisco town, and not while the Charles had breathe to protect one of their own. It looked bad for the torch singer, the two gangster club owners and assorted other decoys for a while. Hey, what about a society guy who has felt nothing but unrequited rage ever since his sweetie took up with a male gold-digger. Nice work Nick and Nora.",1399075200,,3169,4.670250896057348

390720,5,6301964179,"There are a few times in cinema history where a sequel is equal or better than the original. Where instead of simply following the same plot almost identical, or trying to build off the same plot of the last film by repeating it sometimes lazily, a film might instead takes a different turn to try and outperform the original. Similar to what the Godfather Trilogy did. ""After The Thin Man"" (1936) is one of those films that takes a unique different turn from the original ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and it works brilliantly. Although in this review I will talk only about this particular film, and not the more inferior four follow up sequels that would later come. Which honestly never matched the creativity and originality of the first two films of this series. ""After The Thin Man"" (1936) is the second of the Myrna Loy and William Powell ""Thin Man"" film series after ""The Thin Man"" (1934). Event wise it takes place days after the first one left off except in San Francisco instead of New York which you can tell by the opening of this film. I highly recommend watching both ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and ""After The Thin Man"" (1937) back to back or in order of each other since they play out as though they're one film when watched together. I will not give away plot spoilers so I won't get into the plot of the film(s).  While the first film was a light fun comedy of a tag team detective married duel type film with Myrna Loy playing Nora Charles and William Powell playing Nick Charles this film goes a different route...and it works. Still a light and at times slapstick comedy this film takes a darker almost Hitchcockish type of turn, and by the end of the film has a more darken serious and psychotic approach than the original. It's hard to explain in words, but if you seen the original, and seen this follow up than you'll know what I mean. The later inferior sequels do not follow this style of this second installment and seem to bounce between simply comical and at times senseless.  James Stewart stars in this sequel and he's not the sweet ""Ah shucks"" type you're use too in films such as ""Made For Each Other"" (1939) and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946).  William Powell and Myrna Loy have the gifted presence to be silly and comical one minute yet cold and serious the next.  Elissa Landi plays her role nicely yet deeply as her character was meant to be.  I highly recommend this as I do of the original. Other than ""Another Thin Man"" (1939) which I would give 3.5/4 out of five stars and still is pretty good and watchable although it follows the first film's plot style, but not as great as the first two, I would stay away from the last three especially ""Song Of The Thin Man"" (1946) which is the sixth and last film of this film series and I found to be the worst of the series, and even Myrna Loy admitted in her autobiography wasn't that great script wise and had lost its appeal since after WWII films took a new road in regards to storylines and plots.  The Thin Man series represents classic post-code Hollywood of the 1930s and 1940s. Five out of Five stars for both ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and ""After The Thin Man"" (1936). I would also recommend buying only on VHS or DVD to have in your personal collection instead of ""Instant Streaming"", and there are sets available where you can buy up too all six in one package.",1369526400,,3340,4.440456769983687

390722,5,6301964179,"After The Thin Man is one hour and fifty - two minutes and was released in theaters on December 25, 1936. Of all six Thin Man movies, this one picks up where the original Thin Man left off. The Charles arrive back home to California on New Years Eve and Nora's Aunt Katherine has invited them to dinner and the only reason Nora said yes because her cousin, Polly, has asked for Nick's help. The gist of the story is Polly's husband Robert has gone missing only to be killed later on in the movie and Polly is the prime suspect. Nick reluctantly takes the case just like he did in the last movie. An on going joke in all the movies he claims to be retired from detective work. I am going to leave of there because if I write any more of the movie, I might give away the ending. Just like the original The Thin Man movie, Nick gathers all the suspects into one room in After The Thin for somebody to slip up. The movie stars Penny Singleton from the Blondie films, a very young James (Jimmy) Stewart, and for you Universal Monsters horror fans George Zucco in a comedy role. After The Thin Man is a great and sequel as well and gets an AAAAA+++++.

390723,5,6301964179,"The second in the ""Thin Man"" series finds Nick and Nora arriving home, in San Francisco, by train.  A minor miracle given that the trains ended in Oakland, but we'll skip the jokes.  Some of the film was shot locally, although it's still nothing more than scene setting, nothing like ""Vertigo"" where San Francisco is practically a character.  It does allow for locals to point out things though, so don't sit too close to any odd looking folks in a theater, or you may end up hearing the penny-tour.

Most of the film unfolds indoors, which allowed MGM to dust off the sets and props from ""San Francisco"", including Jesse Ralph, who reprises her Nob Hill socialite role, complete with pompadour and victorian gowns, in a Victorian castle,  in 1936.  Oh Hollywood.

Unlike today's sequels, which are often to movies based on rather miserable TV shows, no less, this and the one that follows is quite good.  The original ""Thin Man"" was a Dashiell Hammett short story, so they had room to improvise.  It does not follow the first, nor set up the third movie, so any of them can be watched as is, but the first three, at least, are very good old films.

By ""Old"" I mean that everyone dresses like adults, and mostly act like adults.  Nobody is wearing kiddie shorts and blouses, and kiddie hats, like fifty year olds do today.  There are no explosions, no sex or nudity; no special effects that I can think of.  It's not even in 3D, although you might find a version ""in color"", or colorized that is.  It's just a well written, light hearted crime story woven through a screwball comedy, with William Powell and Myrna loy making the perfect couple, without making anyone sick by doing so.

There are different degrees of quality among the movies of this or any other genre, even among the hallowed classics, and this (along with the first and third films in the series) is one of the better screwball comedies that were made.  If you doubt me on that, watch the sixth in the series, shot during WWII, and see what they did to Nick and Nora, ""For The War"".  Oh my.  Thankfully, you don't have to, just watch one of the other ones instead.",1356652800,,2133,4.5248041775456915
390724,5,6301964179,"Myrna Loy and William Powell can do no wrong in my book, and are as flawless as expected in this, the follow-up to the original ""The Thin Man"".

Picking up right off the train that ended the first film, the sleuthing marrieds and their feisty dog Asta are thrust immediately into more intrigue, this one with more twists and turns and surprises than its predecessor.

I'm just wondering if, as I move on to the next one, there's a chance that somebody chunky will appear as a likely culprit...",1354579200,,493,4.52808988764045

You simply cannot call yourself a movie buff without having at your fingertips the complete collection of the Thin Man movies. Nothing but nothing beats Nick and Nora off on an escapade.  It is fun to spot actors who would later become big stars, ala Jimmy Stewart in this one.

So, get a hot cocoa, (or a bourbon) your favorite quilt, (it also helps if it is snowing outside), and click on ""After The Thin Man""...PS:  Take the phone off the hook.  You don't want to miss a single line!",1354233600,,771,4.550724637681159

390748,5,6301964179,"True, the ""Thin Man"" film series is a long way from Dashiell Hammett's original book...the films surely do not fall into the ""hard boiled detective"" genre.

Instead, 'The Thin Man' movies deliver a witty mixture of 'screwball comedy' and mystery with cosmopolitan taste and a simply extraordinary cast.

""After The Thin Man"" is the sequel to ""The Thin Man"", with William Powell and the exquisite Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles.  Nick and Nora are, indeed, the CLASSIC 1930s film couple.  Despite enjoying continuous cocktails and questionable company, the Charles' are the epitome of style and sophistication.

In this outing, Nick and Nora find themselves investigating a mystery on Nora's side of the family.  Nora's family, you see, comes from ""old money"" and never quite approved of her detective husband...but when they need something done, it helps to have someone like Nick close by.

With a supporting cast that includes Jimmy Stewart, ""After The Thin Man"" is another excellent offering in what I think is a great series of films.

Clever, sophisticated 1930's comedy/drama at its best.  And, yes, Asta, Nick and Nora's Wire Fox Terrier, still enjoys separate billing.",1349740800,,1180,5.136125654450262

One other familiar face in this one, too, not counting a few character actors you may recognize. James Stewart plays David Graham, who is in love with Nora's cousin Selma, whose husband Robert has disappeared. As before, telling you much of anything about the story would ruin it. There's a New Year's Eve party at a nightclub, a singer and dancer at the club who is involved, Cops and thugs and reporters and a good bit of insanity. And of course there's Asta, their terrier. Also Mrs. Asta and a litter of cute puppies.",1336694400,,751,4.402877697841727

 The only negative about these movies is the emphasis on the main character's drinking. The drinking is glamorized and shown as a positive attribute, which is not a good thing.  But his tendency to drink continually is a strong part of his personality throughout all the Thin Man movies and contributes to the humor.

390756,4,6301964179,"William Powell and Myrna Loy return as Nick and Nora Charles in the first ""Thin Man"" sequel, AFTER THE THIN MAN (1936).  Again directed by Woody ""One-Take"" Van Dyke, this is very much a case of the sequel matching the original, step for lively step.

Arriving back at their San Francisco home just in time for New Years Eve, Nick and Nora are immediately plunged into yet another baffling murder mystery, this time concerning Nora's cousin Selma (Elissa Landi), who is discovered holding a gun over the dead body of her philandering husband.  The red herrings fly thick and fast with wonderful performances all-round; including Penny ""Blondie"" Singleton as the singer of the Lychee Club, Jessie Ralph as Nora's crusty Aunt, and young Jimmy Stewart as a cow-eyed bachelor in love with Selma.

AFTER THE THIN MAN is brimming with all the witty, playful dialogue between Powell and Loy that also marked the original ""Thin Man"", and it's always a pleasure to see this duo gracing the screen.  A real treat!

The DVD includes the vintage Robert Benchley short ""How to Be a Detective"", cartoon ""The Early Bird and the Worm"", and the trailer.",1247616000,,1135,4.824742268041237

There were several times where the video started chopping. At first I thought the lag was due to a lack of buffering, but throughout the movie (pausing to buffer every ten minutes) I decided that maybe the service wasn't there- amazon VOD was brand new at the time. Never once did it say that it was buffering, and pausing to let it buffer never actually changed the amount of time we could watch it without interruption. And it wasn't my parents' connection speed- they watch hulu all the time and had never seen a buffer in their life. For now, I chalk it up to a new service getting through the hiccups, but my folks are a hard sell to try it again. Maybe after amazon's VOD gets some positive press in a blog or news article I'll return to try it again.",1237507200,,922,4.304597701149425

The dog, Asta, steals a few scenes and you get to see a young Jimmie Stewart! It's a typical Thin Man who done it with Nick's benign criminal friends, not too smart cops, and the chemistry of Loy and Powell.

NOTE: Myrna Loy was quite a patriot. During WWII she was at the front of bond drives and the Canteen USO support for our troops. She was so outspoken about Fascism and Hitler that she was placed on Hitler's infamous black list. Later in life she was a civil rights champion - way before it became popular. She was probably on the KKK black list too!

Did I mention that she had a great figure for a California girl!",1233964800,,750,4.165517241379311
390777,4,6301964179,"There's more fun to be had in this 1936 sequel to The Thin Man.

Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are returning home to San Francisco just in time for New Years.  Instead of the early evening they had planned, they are summoned to a family dinner at Nora's Aunt Katherine's (Jessie Ralph).  Only after dinner do they learn that Cousin Selma (Elissa Landi) is missing her husband.  And they can't go to the police and get their names in the paper.  So a reluctant Nick agrees to find Robert (Alan Marshal).

The case seems to be over pretty quickly when Nick and Nora find Robert at a night club.  But then the dead bodies start piling up.  Can Nick sort this all out?

Once again, we have a fun mix of the comedic and the mysterious.  While the climax is once again the ""gather everyone in one room cliche,"" Nick does solve things this time.  And there are several fun comedic moments along the way, not to mention the great chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy.  That makes their barbs all the funnier as they tease each other back and forth.  There are truly some funny lines here.

Frankly, I haven't heard of most of the cast.  The exception is Jimmy Stewart is an early role.

While I enjoyed it, I found I had to work hard to keep all the men straight.  Most of them looked to similar to me to remember who was who.  And there are a couple fun but pointless scenes.  Heck, I'm still not sure I get the sub-plot involving Asta the dog.

But if you enjoy old movies and are looking for a funny mystery, you can't go wrong with this film.",1215388800,,1571,4.296928327645051

Throw in a couple of full-scale musical numbers and you've the recipe for a flick that should please everyone. Everything about this film is better, including the photography, the sets, dialogue, plot complications, location shooting (including a surprise that always gets San Francisco natives chuckling; watch for the semi-completed Golden Gate Bridge seen from Coit Tower Plaza as the Charles' arrive at their ""home""). And Jimmy Stewart. Yep, Jimmy Stewart. Has no one mentioned a very, very young James Stewart in a supporting role? His charisma and talent are apparent even in this thankless part. You might also recognize Dorothy McNulty's voice as the nightclub singer ... later (as Penny Singleton) she was the voice of Jane Jetson.

390779,5,6301964179,"W.S. Van Dyke's ""After the Thin Man,"" the first of five sequels to the original ""Thin Man,"" is the best of the five and the only one that truly matched the consistent thrills and sprightly fun of the original. It picks up where the first movie left off, as Nick (William Powell) and Nora (Myrna Loy) come home to San Francisco from New York, where they receive a less-than-warm welcome from Nora's staid relatives, especially her choleric, cane-wielding Aunt Catherine (Jessie Ralph). Cousin Selma (Elissa Landi), the one family member close to Nick and Nora, is being driven to distraction by her louse of a husband (Alan Marshall), and asks for Nick and Nora's help. The story that follows is a phantasmagoria of murder, blackmail, skulduggery, and many, many martinis. And, to top it off, Asta has woman trouble. Above all, it's a joy to see Powell and Loy, who could teach Tracy and Hepburn a few lessons about on-screen chemistry, and the usual excellent supporting cast including the very young James Stewart, in what appears to be a dress rehearsal for his later Hitchcock roles.

Their home overlooks San Francisco and the Bay bridge. They hoped for a quiet New Year's Eve, but a surprise party is in full blast. Nora's cousin telephones for help; Selma is afraid. Aunt Catherine invites them to a family dinner. [The partying and drinking must contrast to the viewer's lives at that time.] At the dinner they hear that Selma's husband Robert is missing. A fear of newspaper publicity prevents them from calling the police. A friend, David Graham, has heard from the missing Robert. Singer and dancer Polly has a problem with her brother Phil. Nick and Nora find Robert at a nightclub. Polly is friendly with Robert. [Selma's troubles with her husband tell something about the lives of the very rich.] David pays Robert as part of a deal.

We see the suspicious activities of a number of people. A shot is fired and Robert falls to the ground. Selma is the suspect in this shooting. Lt. Abrams questions some of the people. Then the lights go out, shots are fired, and Dancer escaped. [Too much comedy for a murder mystery?] The kitchen shows a quart glass bottle of milk with a wired-on cap. The film explains how to identify a forged signature. Lt. Abrams finds Phil Byrnes, but he won't talk. Nick Charles investigates Polly's flat, and notices something up high. Then another body falls to the floor. The janitor at that building used to work for Nora's father.

Following the conventions of those times, all the people involved have been brought to that empty flat for questioning in order to try to solve the mystery. One of the people there makes a mistake, and this registers on Nick's expression. The questioning brings out surprising facts about some of the people. Then Nick unmasks the murderer and explains the reasoning. The ending has a new surprise for Nick. [Viewer polling to get a larger audience?]

""Wait'll you see my other side."" -- Nora

William Powell and Myrna Loy returned as Nick and Nora Charles for the first time since ""The Thin Man"" and set the tone for all the entries in the most heralded series in film history. ""After the Thin Man"" was a class ""A"" production from MGM, with W.S. Van Dyke at the helm and a good screenplay based on an original Hammett story. Nick is drinking his way to San Fransisco as he and Nora ride the rails, first class, shortly after wrapping up the celerated ""Thin Man"" case.

Onboard the Sunset Limited Nick and Nora pick up right where they left off, and audiences could make believe that two years hadn't passed since they'd fallen in love with the fun-loving couple with a nose for murder. The mystery in this one doesn't quite have the zip of the original, but MGM knew it was the delicious banter of Nick and Nora, placed between scotch and martinis, which audiences were thirsting for. Those fun and charming exchanges are plentiful as Nick reluctantly gets tangled up with a murder on Nora's side of the isle.

There is a fine cast but the story plays second fiddle to Nick and Nora ringing in the New Year while a jealous Asta watches over Mrs. Asta and a litter of puppies. Three murders will occur before Nick gathers all the suspects together hoping someone will slip up and give themselves away in this one. While it takes a bit too long to get there, it's so entertaining no one has had the heart to complain about it in over 70 years.

Everything was top-drawer in this series, from the art direction of Cedric Gibbons to Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed's song, ""Smoke Dreams."" There is some fun news at the end which teased fans with more to come from Nick and Nora and we still can't get enough of our favorite mystery couple decades later.

390796,5,6301964179,"""After the Thin Man"" picks up where 1934's classic comedic mystery ""The Thin Man"" left off. Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) are returning by train to their home in San Francisco. They arrive on New Year's Eve to a gaggle of reporters plying Nick for details of the now-famous Thin Man case and a house full of drunken revelers. Nora's fragile cousin Selma (Elissa Landi) insists that the couple join her for dinner at the family home, hoping Nick will be able to help with a problem: Selma's philandering husband Robert (Alan Marshall) is missing. The generally disapproving family matriarch Aunt Katherine (Jessie Ralph) will do anything to avoid a scandal. And Selma's former fianc Robert (Jimmy Stewart), who still loves her, hopes that Robert is gone for good this time. So much for Nick and Nora's plans to relax for a while.

The creative talent from ""The Thin Man"" reunited for this sequel: Dashiell Hammett contributed the (unpublished) story. Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett wrote the screenplay. And W. S. Van Dyke directs. Of the five ""Thin Man"" sequels that were made 1936-1947, ""After the Thin Man"" is the only one that approaches the quality of the original. It doesn't match ""The Thin Man""'s witty banter between Nick and Nora, which explains why this film is not as fondly remembered. But it does match, and possibly exceeds, the mystery and cast of suspects. There are colorful underworld characters, indelicate and unscrupulous dames, and a hard-boiled police detective, Lieutenant Abrams (Sam Levene). This is notable, because the police become buffoons, played for laughs, in subsequent ""Thin Man"" films.  Dashiell Hammett is characteristically unflattering to everyone: The underworld is motivated purely by material gain and completely lacking in ethics, while the aristocracy's values are outdated and out-of-touch. A well-written and thoroughly entertaining film.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): This print has some minor white specks, but the picture is otherwise good, and sound is good. Bonus features include a short film and a cartoon, as is usual for the ""Thin Man"" DVDs, but this one also includes some old radio programs. ""How to Be a Detective"" (9 min) is a short film in which satirist Robert Benchley gives us comedic lessons in how to recognize criminal types, catch and criminal, and get a confession. ""The Early Bird Gets the Worm"" (9 min) is a Harmon-Ising cartoon of a bluebird chasing an elusive worm while a rattlesnake chases them both. ""6/17/1940 Lux Radio Theater Broadcast"" (audio only) is a radio play, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, of ""After the Thin Man"", introduced by Cecile B. Demille. It's a good play but completely redundant if you're seen the movie. ""Leo Is on the Air Radio Promo"" (audio only) is a ""cavalcade of musical hits"" from 1936 movies, including the song ""Smoke Dreams"" from ""After the Thin Man"". There is also a theatrical trailer (3 min). Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French.",1143158400,5,3043,5.045725646123261
390797,4,6301964179,"Poor Dashiell Hammett.  He wrote a book that became a movie that was better than the book.  Lucky MGM. They then made a sequel that was better than the movie.  ""After The Thin Man"" has the zippy, syncopated swingtime score that one would rightly associate with all of the 6 films, but which is absent in the original.  (There is also too much music in the second film, pointing out the holes in the plot that was lifted from the original).  But, all in all, if you only have tonight to see a Thin Man film, because your gay uncle said you must, and gave you a bottle of good gin to go with it (he was right, you really do want some cocktails on hand) see ""After The Thin Man"".

This time, they're home (their lawn is the backyard of Coit Tower)and one of their in-laws has disappeared.  The battle axe of an aunt (Jessie Ralph) is basically reprising the role she played in another MGM great, ""San Francisco"" (1936) and it seems that she's wearing the same clothes too; and she wants it kept out of the papers.  Like all the Thin Man films, especially the better, first three; the best humor is between man and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Charles, and how they deal with the situations that arise.  In essence, they know with whom they will be ending the night, so it doesn't matter to them who stumbles, or sachets-in along the way.  Hollywood doesn't make such films, or create such characters today, and to be truthful, as married folks in film, they were stand-outs then.  Instead of jealous fits and hand wringing suspense driving the plot, there's a rather cool headed humor based on a boundless and well founded trust between the two, that sparks most of the wit and leavens the plot.

""After The Thin Man"" is very entertaining, a true Classic, and an easy evening-in.  Anyone trying to build a relationship would profit from watching this film, especially if they try to emulate the reactions of the Nick and Nora, when something goes wrong, or might be.  Yet, in the end, it's entertainment, and very well done entertainment, at that.",1122768000,,2034,4.506811989100817
390798,5,6301964179,"William Powell and Myrna Loy are GOLD as Nick and Nora Charles in this, the very best of the Thin Man Series. The laughs never stop coming, as one-liner after one-liner are exchanged. At times the characters names and their roles can become a bit confusing, but you'll enjoy this film never the less.

Jimmy Stewart also has a nice little role, and is the best of the supporting cast. One of the best scenes in the film is when Nora brings Nick to her family's for New Years Eve. As soon as they enter the living room, one of her aunts says very seriously, ""Nora, you poor girl."" (none of the relatives are very fond of her husband). Nick later enjoys some quality time with his in-laws, having a conversation with them as they snore (really quite a brilliantly funny scene). Also, for those of you who have seen Mel Brookes films and are quite familiar with the ""walk this way"" gag (recycled much too much), you'll like seeing it in this film.

The nice thing about After The Thin Man is that, unlike it's predecessor, it is never boring. I sort of thought The Thin Man got off on a slow start, where the second installment of the series gets started off right away. Another scene not to be missed: when Asta almost eats a clue! Nick and Nora go crazy trying to retrieve the info from the dog, who thinks it's all just a game. This a very fun comedy that is not to be missed!!",1105142400,,1377,4.312741312741313
390799,5,6301964179,"The very first THIN MAN movie was so popular due to love bickering relationship between Nick and Nora. It was no doubt a treat to see a married couple pick at each other and all the while the love they shared for each other was evident to all. The murder mystery almost takes second place to the bickering between Nick and Nora. Not so in AFTER THE THIN MAN.
AFTER THE THIN MAN devotes the bulk of the story to the murder mystery. Nick, who is still supposedly retired from detective work, gets lured into another case. A relative of Nora's needs Nick to prove her innocent. The case seems iron clad and Lieutenant Abrams, portrayed by Sam Levene is sure who the killer is. Only Nick seems to be able to sift through all the circumstantial evidence and get to the real evidence. Nora dogs his every step as she attempts to convince her family Nick is a good man even if he wears a ""blue"" collar.
James Stewart, prior to becoming famous, does well as the rejected love interest of the accused murderer. He will do anything to help her...or will he? Penny Singleton, prior to her role as Blondie Bumstead in the BLONDIE movies and her providing her voice as Jan Jetson on the JETSONS, has an interesting role as 1930's sexy street sassy blonde. As she would tell you, she's not illiterate because her parents were married at city hall.
So, while the original THIN MAN was fresh and new AFTER THE THIN MAN has all the dents and dings banged out of the script. It is a much better and much more interesting film. It is my favorite of the six THIN MAN films.
The DVD edition of this film is long overdue.",1083110400,10,1599,4.369127516778524
390800,5,6301964179,"The second in the series of Thin Man films and the second best one, just a notch below the first.  The story begins just days after the first movie.  Nick and Nora have returned to their very luxurious home in California from New York.

They arrive home to find a house full of (uninvited) guests who are there to welcome the couple back home.  They attend a Dinner party at Nora's very uptight socialite Aunt.  Hilarious watching Nick interact with these old, wealthy step-relatives.

Soon, though, Nora's cousin Selma is accused of murdering her estranged husband and Nick and Nora have to step in to investigate.

This time the Charles celebrate New Years Eve with plenty of drinks at the night club of a small-time hood named Dancer.  Nick is joined by a table full of his old friends and ne'er-do-wells in the club all drinking and having a great time.

Sam Levine is very funny making his first of two appearances as Lt. Abrahms.  A young Jimmy Stewart is also along as the unrequited love of Selma.

As with the first, the drinks flow freely, particularly in the night club scenes where Nick finds himself the object of affection of a drunken young lady, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend.

Fantastic banter between the two stars as usual.  Their chemistry was second to none.  Asta is along too.

This was also, I think one of the better mysteries of all the Thin Man movies.  Where is the DVD????",1074038400,6,1408,4.572
390801,3,6301964179,"William Powell and Mryna Loy belong high up on Hollywood's great comedy teams. Infact that should be AFI's next list. The 100 greatest Hollywood teams. And I bet Powell and Loy would place high if only for their work in ""The Thin Man"" series.
 ""After the Thin Man"" is the sequel to the 1934 film ""The Thin Man"". And it's almost as wonderful as the first. The witty dialogue, the chemistry between Powell and Loy and the charm of the first one is all here.
 The story starts off with Nick and Nora (Powell and Loy) returning from New York after solving the crime in the first movie (I feel you do not have to see these movies in order to understand them. But, I do think one should see the first movie first only to help you understand the lead characters. After that you can watch them in any order you like). Wanting to spend a quite evening home alone and sleeping the Charles' find that they have been invited to Nora's Aunt Katherine's (Jessie Ralph) house. Selma,(Elissa Landi)Nora's cousin is having problems with her husband. He has left her for another woman. Not wanting the police to find out thus bringing the family name to disgrace they ask Nick if he'll help them find Robert (Alan Marshall), Selma's husband.
 As the movie goes on we find that Robert has been shoot. But who did it? Was it Selma, jealous that she has lost her husband? Was it David Graham (James Stewart). A friend who has been in love with Selma and was being brided by Robert. Could it of been Polly (Penny Singleton), the woman Robert was having an affair with? ""After the Thin Man"" has a lot of fun figuring that out.
 By the time this movie was made Powell and Loy had appeared in quite a few films already. And many of them had been directed by the same director of this movie W.S. van Dyke. They include ""Manhattan Melodrama"", and ""The Thin Man"". Later on in their careers they would also work together on ""I Love You Again"" and a few other ""Thin Man"" movies. I mention this so you can understand that the 3 of them seem to understand each other. Dyke know for his ""one take"" approach seemed suited to direct these two. All of the films are charming and bright. They each offer that wonderful old fashion Hollywood charm.
 If you haven't seen any of the ""Thin Man"" movies I honestly do feel it would be better to see the original first. But, ""After the Thin Man"" is a lot of fun. I also feel it's better then the next installment ""Another Thin Man"".
 Bottom-line: Very good follow-up to the original ""Thin Man"". Witty and bright them movie is filled with charm. Has good performance and over-all is just a lot of fun to watch.",1056499200,3,2615,4.403726708074534
390802,4,6301964179,"In AFTER THE THIN MAN Nick tries to get one of Nora's female relatives out of jail after she is put there for the murder of her husband. The story takes place in the vicinity of San Francisco's Nob Hill.
The movie was released in 1936 two years following THE THIN MAN. Again Hunt Stromberg was the producer and the director was W.S. Van Dyke. Francis Goodrich and Albert Hackert returned to handle the screenplay. William Powell and Myrna Loy were backed up by another large supporting cast which included James Stewart. AFTER THE THIN MAN was a high quality sequel which did much to ensure the continued popularity of the series. Before the end of the film Nora told Nick that she was pregnant with their first child.
AFTER THE THIN MAN received an Oscar nomination in 1936 for Best Screenplay.",1051228800,3,795,4.605633802816901
390803,5,6301964179,"""After the Thin Man"" is the second of five sequels in ""The Thin Man"" series. It was released in 1936, two years after the original movie, and literally takes up where the first one left off - aboard the Sunset Limited headed from New York to California.
Having had their Christmas holidays in New York interrupted by a murder mystery [much to Nick Charles' dismay and wife Nora's delight], the couple is looking forward to a quiet New Year's Eve at home. This is not to be. Their house, it seems, has a huge cocktail party going on in it. And - you guessed it - there's another mystery brewing. Nora's cousin's husband has gone missing, and scandal threatens her stuffy, socialite family. Nick could care less. He has no use for his holier-than-thou in-laws. Nora is concerned - and not a little thrilled at the prospect of another adventure.
William Powell and Myna Loy are, as always, Nick and Nora. They are one of the great screen couples of all time. Their relationship is often hysterically funny, sometimes touching, and more than a little complicated. A very young James Stewart has a meaty supporting role. The star quality is easy to see. Selma Landis is in top form as the neurotic cousin who is under the thumb of her frightfully domineering mother.
""After the Thin Man"" [great sequel title!] is only slightly less entertaining than its predecessor and is certainly superior to most of the comedies of today. That superiority is due to great screen writing, true star power and a genuine zest for life that rarely is seen today - at least in the movies.

390804,5,6301964179,"If you are ready for great fun, this detective film also qualifies as a classic comedy.  After a hilarious return to San Francisco, Nick and Nora encounter a murder on New Year's Eve.  The witty and sophisticated repartee of William Powell and Myrna Loy remains the primary appeal of the Thin Man series.  The key word is ""sophisticated.""  We are not speaking of slapstick and pratfalls.  Nick and Nora demonstrate that it is fun to be married, especially in a relationship of equals.  They are wealthy, but Nick relishes his working class background.  He is a favorite of cab drivers, newsboys, and beer truck drivers.  Nora's chutzpah enables her to keep pace.  This time, Nora's snooty family is in for some ribbing.  It seems that most people related to Nora are over the age of 70.  Although the family disapproves of Nick's background as a ""flatfoot,"" they ask him to investigate cousin Selma's missing husband.  The sets up several funny sequences ranging from dinner at haughty Aunt Catherine's to the New Year's Eve party at the Li Chi club.  When recently released convict Willie the Weeper and his cronies join Nick and Nora's party at the Li Chi, the humor flies fast and furious.  A strong supporting cast was another hallmark of the series.  A young Jimmy Stewart plays Selma's old boy friend, who wants her back.  Dorothy McNaulty is the cabaret singer.  Later, she changed her hair color, changed name to Penny Singleton, and played Blondie in the old movie series.  The entertainment is as fresh and vital as it was almost 70 years ago.
