7907575,5,B00000F55N,Melissa Manchester has a great voice. Since she doesn't tour in this part of town I am glad I found this on Amazon. It was a good concert!,1398124800,,138,3.9642857142857144
7907576,5,B00000F55N,"If you have enjoyed Melissa Manchester's music over the years, this is the video for you. This is a live show taped around 1980 at the Wilshire Theatre in Los Angeles for an HBO special. I happened to have attended this taping and had looked for a recording of it ever since. Melissa is on stage with a full orchestra and backup singers and, of course, her trusty piano. It's a great show and brings back many memories of her past songs. The songs in the show are: ""Help Is On The Way"", ""Midnight Blue"", O, Heaven (How You've Changed To Me)"", Whenever I Call You Friend"", ""For the Working Girl"", ""As Time Goes By"", ""It's All in the Sky Above"", ""Home to Myself"", ""This Lady's Not Home Today"", ""Peace In My Heart"", ""Good News for the Lady"", ""We've Got Time"", ""Easy"", ""Talkin To Myself"", ""Don't Cry Out Loud"", ""Boy Next Door"" and ""Come In From The Rain"". As you can see, it covers many of her great old songs. You won't be disappointed.",1024704000,,933,4.367816091954023
