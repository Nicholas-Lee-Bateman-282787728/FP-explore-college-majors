4990562,5,B006IJNU04,"""The Mudlark"" was made in 1950 and is a classic Twentieth Century Fox produced
British Film that has been neglected for far too long.  However, here it is at last, a
film that is rich in characterizations and brilliant performances.

The impeccable cast includes:
Irene Dunne as Queen Victoria
Alec Guinness as Benjamin Disraeli
Andrew Ray as Wheeler (""The Mudlark"")
Beatrice Campbell as Lady Emily Prior
Finlay Currie as John Brown
Anthony Steel as Lieutenant Charles McHatten

The story is set in 1875 London and young Wheeler is an orphan and a ""Mudlark""
(a child of the streets) who lives by scavenging along the banks of the Thames
River.  One day he finds a medallion with the image of Queen Victoria engraved
upon it and it is explained to him that she is the mother of all England.  The boy is
impressed and he sets out to meet her.  Queen Victoria, however, has shut
herself away in isolation in the palace for many years after the death of her
husband and never ventures out despite Disraeli's constant attempts to convince
her to end her seclusion.

Wheeler manages to by-pass the palace guards unnoticed and gain access to the
palace where he wanders about aimlessly.  Eventually, he is apprehended and at
first thought to be part of an Irish plot to assassinate the Queen.  He is later
befriended by John Brown who takes him on a guided tour of the palace and into
the throne room where he sits on the throne despite stiff opposition from the
palace dignitaries.  The relationship between the Queen and the boy never
becomes intimate and in fact throughout the movie they never meet face to face
until the end of the movie and then it is only for a brief 4 minutes.

The movie is presented in the best tradition of fine films and is a joy to watch
with fascinating performances from all.  Highly recommended.",1365033600,16,1821,4.638629283489097
4990563,5,B006IJNU04,Not well known is this gem which stars Alec Guiness as Prime Minister of Britain trying to convince Irene Dunn ( recluse queen still mourning death of her husband King Albert) to get out and let the people see her.  A small boy steals his way into the palace and events lead to the queen's change of life style.,1362441600,2,311,4.271186440677966

4990565,5,B006IJNU04,"Not heard from in a long while, this is a not-to-be-missed historical film with magnificent black and white photography. Irene Dunne is excellent as Queen Victoria. It is a very interesting and entertaining film. Highly recommended.",1358380800,9,232,5.472222222222222
4990566,5,B006IJNU04,This Movie THE MUDLARK is a splendid film with great performances. Especially Irene Dunne as Queen Victoria & Guiness as Disraeli the British P.M. This movie can be purchased from a company in California: MOVIELEADS. This movie from Movieleads will play in Region 1 (USA & CANADA).,1327017600,18,281,5.0
4990567,5,B006IJNU04,"If Britain had a Disney, this would have been his finest moment Director Jean Negulesco had every right to be proud of this film. it is a simple story, charming, very well told, and equally well acted. Sir Alec Guinness portrays and honourable Prime Minister looking for a way to change the fortunes of a generation of children whose lives have been marked terrifying poverty, the complete lack of education, and pervasive hopelessness. Fortune provides him with an opportunity: street urchin,  a mudlark -  a boy who makes his living scavenging the title mud flats of the Thames River. Brave beyond measure, and equally foolish, the lad makes his way into the presence of his Queen, the lonely dowager Victoria.",1443830400,,712,4.925
4990568,5,B006IJNU04,"If you were a kid in the 60's, and grew up watching NBC's ""Saturday Night at the Movies,""
you must have seen this little B & W sweetie ten times.  This, along with Tyron Power and Orson
Wells in ""The Black Rose,"" and Edmond Purdom, Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, and Peter
Ustinov in ""The Egytian,"" seemed to run in rotation.
  It's the 1950 film adaptation of Theodore Bonnet's novel.  It features a marvelous cameo by Finlay
Currie playing Victoria's, Scots attendant, John Brown, who's own story was told in the 1997, ""Mrs.
Brown,"" with Judi Dench and Billy Connolly.",1434240000,,568,4.707070707070707

4990570,5,B006IJNU04,I first saw this film on TV when I was a boy.  Then it disappeared for years.  I'm so glad that it's out on DVD; it's a heart-warmer.  Guinness is especially good as Disraeli.,1433721600,,175,4.088235294117647

4990572,5,B006IJNU04,"Quite the sleeper this film.  Irene Dunne unrecognizable under the make up is heartbreaking as Victoria.  The kid is the kid, a nice foil to all the palace guards and the direction really puts you  there in the dark,damp of the  rivers edge and inside Windsor.
Highly recommended.",1431043200,,280,4.770833333333333
4990573,5,B006IJNU04,"""Sentimental without being mawkish."" I read that in a review of another Alec Guinness movie, and it seems to fit here. A little orphan boy, covered with dirt, who lives by selling Thames River refuse to a pawnbroker (hence ""The Mudlark"") finds a medallion of Queen Victoria's face in a dead man's pocket, is told that she is ""The Mother of England"" (he thinks England is a part of London), and sets off to see her in person. Alec Guinness loved his part as Prime Minister Disraeli, Andrew Ray is perfect as the Mudlark, and Irene Dunne plays a totally charming and attractive Queen Victoria.

Nit-picks: An actor playing an Irish servant overacts, and a romantic subplot seems out of place, but only until it becomes a test of Victoria's humanity.

High points: Sir Alec gives a long and exciting speech to The House of Commons in one take. Andrew Ray does not like being given a bath.",1428624000,,885,4.594936708860759

4990583,5,B006IJNU04,"This comes from the Fox Archives and is a pressed on demand title. Fortunately the source material is very nice. Nunnally Johnson's screenplay and Jean Negulesco's directing are both very fine but it in the performances of Irene Dunne, Alec Guinness, Finlay Currie and others that make this film very powerful and touching. Irene Dunne plays Queen Victoria who has shut herself off from public life after the death of her husband. A mudlark (a boy from the streets) is told that she is the ""mother"" of her country and sneaks into the castle in hopes of meeting her. This causes a political storm and leads to Alec Guinness pleading to Britain's leaders to do something to help the unfortunate of the slums. Guinness delivers a magnificent speech which is done in a single take that is worth the purchase of the disc. Dunne is excellent as the Queen. Excellent film well worth purchasing. No Extras.",1378771200,7,898,4.762820512820513

8498709,4,B006IJNU04,"Watching any film with Alec Guinness is a treat (and not  just due to Star Wars). The man was more than just a versatile actor: he was a chameleon who established himself as such in Kind Hearts and Coronets and carried that talent through to Tinker,Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Here he plays Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister to Queen Victoria. If you can tell that he's a young actor playing a much older man, then you are more observant than I am. He pulled off the same trick as George Smiley. Watch Tinker, Tailor, then watch him play kick- the-can with Ricky Schroeder in Little Lord Fauntleroy, made in the same year. I gave The Mudlark only four stars instead of five because there are a few foggy, night sequences that are very dim and blurry in this print.",1520121600,,758,4.532846715328467

'Wheeler' a small boy with no family/mother, heard the Queen was the mother of all her subjects and took it literally.  Decided to see his Queen/Mother.  Beautiful Constance Smith, 'stole the show' with her fine performance as a maid who does as much as she could to help the boy when he was discovered in the castle.",1483056000,,384,4.701492537313433

8498714,5,B006IJNU04,"The Mudlark is a charming movie made in Britain by 20th Century Fox, a fictionalized account of how Queen Victoria was eventually brought out of her mourning for her dead husband, Prince Albert.  It was based on the 1949 novel of the same name by American artillery sergeant and newspaperman Theodore Bonnet (19081983), directed by Jean Negulesco, written and produced by Nunnally Johnson. The legendary American film actress and singer of the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s Irene Dunne is magnificent as Victoria... best Ive ever seen her portrayed (possible exception: Scottish character actress Annette Crosbie in the 1975 PBS mini-series Edward the Seventh). Dunnes stern but gentle performance is enhanced by superb make-up and costume... theyve even made her short!  Shed dominate the movie if Alec Guinness as the fabled Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and the young Andrew Ray as the Mudlark himself weren't just as good.  (""Mudlarks"" were street children who survived by scavenging and selling what they could find on the banks of the River Thames.)  Guinness is superb as Disraeli, the spitting image (how vivid), with great lines, such as Such proposals as slum clearance, public housing, educational facilities for the poor, are all wise and worthy measures and consequently will be opposed vigorously. The British are a proud and independent people, ma'am, and will not yield to improvement without a stout struggle.  This was only Guinness sixth film, and helped to contribute to his fame and popularity in America.  Veteran character actor Finlay Currie engagingly plays Victorias faithful companion John Brown, and Beatrice Campbell and Anthony Steel are a young court lady and a military officer who are in love.  Andrew Ray was born Andrew Olden (Ray was his father's stage name), in North London, the son of the famous radio comic Ted Ray and his wife, showgirl Dorothy Sibil. Ray's life was transformed at the age of 10 when he was cast as The Mudlark, playing the street urchin who seeks to meet Queen Victoria. The film was a huge hit in Britain and was chosen as the Royal Command Performance in 1950 and catapulted Ray to child stardom.  Ray is fine in the film.  Hed have made an excellent Oliver Twist, better than any Ive seen (spunky and intelligent).  Nunnally Johnsons (he did The Grapes of Wrath, How To Marry a Millionaire and dozens of other hits) screenplay is clever, witty and charming.  Even in black-and-white, the sets and costumes are also fine (its great fun to see the boy wander around in the palace).  All in all a great movie.",1465948800,2,2570,4.978971962616822

8498716,5,B006IJNU04,"Entertaining tale.  Irene Dunne's acting is excellent as usual, with fine support from Alec Guiness.  Irene's fans reportedly did not like the fact that she wore a rubber mask and padding so as to look like Queen Victoria, but that does not detract from her acting.",1444348800,,265,4.739130434782608
