7879739,4,6304888449,"This documentary recounts the decline and fall of the Romanov dynasty. For those of you who are interested in this slice of history, the images alone are worth watching.

The interviews, however, are suspect, primarily due to the advanced age of many of the subjects, but some of them, such as Prince Michael, also have a politcal agenda that must be taken into consideration. Bear in mind that Nicholas II was the last czar of Russia for many reasons and on many levels. A stronger, more intelligent czar might well could have enacted reforms preventing the revolution and bringing Russia into the modern world without bloodshed. The heir's hemophilia is overemphasized, as is Rasputin's role.

Again, despite it's obviously sympathetic approach to the subject, it's worth watching for the video footage and the images alone.",1153440000,7,826,5.111111111111111
