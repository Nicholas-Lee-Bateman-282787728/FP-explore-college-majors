But sad note besides this is a great movie that I will keep forever in my watchlist for a rainy day movie.",1452211200,2,358,4.128571428571429

8467974,4,B005E7SFGA,"This forgotten film, starring James Mason (and produced by James Mason), concerns the end of Sted Bonnet's pirating career. Bonnet left a relatively comfortable life in Barbados to become a pirate by purchasing a sloop and sailing with approximately 70 men. They engaged in raids in the Caribbean and eventually worked their way up to the Bahamas. It is there Bonnet met up with Edward Teach and became one of his men. As the story goes, what Teach wanted wasn't Bonnet's expertise but rather his sloop to increase the number of vessels in his pirate fleet. Eventually, Teach and Bonnet had a falling out and Bonnet was cast adrift to die. That event establishes the primary historical fact of the film.

A family recently freed from their indentures and granted title to an island off the Carolina province (geologically, the volcanic island in the film is incorrect) discovers the castaway on one of its beaches, revives him, and allows him to become part of their pioneering venture. They know there is something unusual about the castaway since he is quite knowledgeable about things. This welcoming of the stranger occurs just in time since the pioneering party, despite being in possession of legal title to the land, quickly finds itself embroiled in a dispute over the island with piratical squatters whose principal occupation appears to be fishing.

This summary of the plot, which lacks account of the film's conclusion, is offered to underscore the nature of the film's difference from other contemporary formulaic pirate films of the late 1940's, 1950's, and early 1960's since Mason's effort as actor and producer appears to have been the establishment of an historical account of eighteenth-century Atlantic piracy. That the film was quickly forgotten may have been the result of its experiment with realism being too much for viewing audiences to take. That Mason was starring as Humbert Humbert in ""Lolita"" in the same year may explain why nothing more was said of Sted Bonnet.

Whatever the reason, the film was very much ahead of its time cinematographically as well as in content for it carefully reveals the many hardships suffered by colonial American pioneering settlers and pirates alike. The film attempts to recapture the historical element that once defined earlier pirate films before Hollywood developed the acceptable pirate film formula, and so anticipates the cinematographic experiments with realism that would follow in the later 1960's and 1970's.",1391472000,5,2482,5.153846153846154
8467975,3,B005E7SFGA,"Part 'Swiss Family Robinson' and part 'Straw Dogs,' 1962's 'Hero's Island' is a curious but amiable allegory/adventure pitting a family of island-dwelling colonial-American pacifists against a small gang of local hooligan-fishermen, the lesson here being that when facing such odds it always helps (the former, of course) to have God and/or a famous blood-letting pirate on your side. Now, if you can swallow the forced premise, which plays out more like a '50s 'morality' western than a swashbuckler (the action is pretty lame, anyway), what makes this film remarkable is its unlikely lineup of iconic character actors-- Rip Torn, Neville Brand, Warren Oates and Harry Dean Stanton, all of whom receive substantial screen time-- plus the great James Mason (who also co-produced) as Blackbeard (if HI isn't the winning question to some arcane answer on 'Jeopardy' it ought to be). It's a sincere effort by TV producer/writer/director Leslie Stevens and his cast, and features some nice panoramic photography (with Santa Catalina Island/Channel Islands, CA, standing in for Bull Island on the U.S. East Coast), though it's not terribly successful as either parable or entertainment. 3-minus stars.",1355443200,2,1196,5.435483870967742
