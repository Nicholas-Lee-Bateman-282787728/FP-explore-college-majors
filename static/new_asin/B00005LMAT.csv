2807304,3,B00005LMAT,"Reason why I didn't give this 5 stars: the movie, while in English, has been dubbed into French. And, while I do understand some French, it isn't enough to make it through an entire movie.
Now, on to the review:
not a bad film, lots of imagery, creepiness and blood. Forget that there are some instances where you can tell the effects were less than stellar- for instance during some of the killings one can tell that the actors missed the mark by a wide margin. Not a detractor, just not as believable. Seems like it could be a good story, like Scooby-do meets Josey and the Pussycats meets Cirque du Freak, so it looked kinda fun and campy, but I couldn't follow most of the film because it was dubbed in French. The music sung by the band WAS in English, and actually pretty darned good!

My favorite part was the steam roller scene, because it brought back memories of Mike Myer's ""Austin Powers"", and I am quite sure he borrowed this scene for his film (although he drew it out more and made it much more laughable, not that this one wasn't). Seriously, who would ever think you couldn't outrun a steam roller? And the comedic look of surprise! Loved it!

Could acutally get 4, maybe 5 stars if it was in the original English, AMAZON!!!!!!!",1383436800,,1245,4.456140350877193
2807305,2,B00005LMAT,"And let me get this out of the way: The woman on the cover never gets naked. But beyond that, it's a mediocre movie. Knowing French may help, but it just wasn't very deep.",1375056000,,171,4.0588235294117645
2807306,4,B00005LMAT,"In KILLER BARBYS, a band called Killer Barbies  (led by Silvia Superstar) heads out after a show, only to break down in the middle of nowhere. Luckily, they happen upon a castle. Oh no! Said castle is the home of an ancient vampire woman, and she's very thirsty! Our heroes soon find themselves being killed off by the bloodsucker's henchman and his eeevil dwarfs! KILLER BARBYS is another wacky, erotic-spooker from Jess Franco. It contains the standard amount of nudity, extra blood, gore, and a semi-cohesive plotline. I must admit that I love the vampire lady. She's hot, ruthless, and downright animalistic! KB is one of Franco's better, modern offerings...  P.S.- Gorehundts will want to stick around for the death-by-steamroller finale!...",1370304000,,746,5.1570247933884295
2807307,1,B00005LMAT,"Yep, that's the title...'Killer Barbys'. I read they couldn't use 'Barbies' in the title due to issues with Mattel toys.  Turns out that 'Killer Barbies' is actually the name of the punk rock group that stars in this film.  The title attracted me to it thinking it might be worth a few laughs, it wasn't. I should have checked a little more about the film before I decided to watch it. This was written and directed by Jesus Franco.  I kind of like some of his earlier work like 'The Diabolical Dr. Z (1966) and 'The Awful Dr. Orlof' (1962).  After seeing this it's obvious he is well overdue for retirement. There was nothing to the formula story that hasn't been done a hundred times before and much better. Yes, there's gore, luckily of the silly very fake variety. Even the bodies looked fake...stiff as plastic mannequins when they're carried.  There's one scene where a nude vampire woman is thrown out a window.  When she leaves the room from the inside she's naked....as we see  her falling from outside the house she is wearing a white negligee. She must have stopped somewhere between the top floor and the ground to put it on. The whole movie is ridiculous...I really should have turned it off, I was mesmerized by how poor it was.  I can't believe they actually made a sequel a few years later.  I read it's even worse than this one. For some reason the copy I viewed off Amazon Prime had no English dubbing or subtitles. I give this a 1 out of 5 rating because at least the music was catchy.",1363824000,3,1504,4.45985401459854
2807308,5,B00005LMAT,"This unusally light Jess Franco horror/comedy delivers.  It's
absurd, silly, goes over-the-top, and stays there.

Forget about plots, just enjoy the music and Silva Superstar.

The music videos alone are worth the price.  Rent it at Netflix,
then buy it at Amazon.

Do not expect acting, good F/X, or anything else that I always
spotlight in films.  Just kick back and enjoy.",1194048000,,375,4.967741935483871
2807309,2,B00005LMAT,"The mere mention of the name Jesus ""Jess"" Franco in the presence of movie fans will elicit several reactions. Some filmgoers will shrug their shoulders as if to say, ""Who's he?"" These people likely spend a lot of time watching big budget, multiplex friendly cinema. Other folks will smile. These film fans recognize this director's name in the context of ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""The Marquis De Sade's Justine,"" two Franco movies that actually contain a hint of style. Then there are the poor wretches who'll hear his name and visibly pale, groan as though they've eaten food that's given them salmonella poisoning, and slink quietly away into a corner for a few hours of serious sulking. I fall somewhere in between the last two categories. I liked ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""Justine,"" but I've also seen enough Franco films to understand the utter banality of a large segment of his filmography. Falling with a resounding clunk in the ""so bad its pretty bad"" category is the 1996 effort ""Killer Barbys."" Franco proves once again that he's lost none of the traits that make up a bad filmmaker. Actually, a couple of things in the film work, but most of what we see here is strictly groan inducing.

The movie begins by showing us some poor chap dying at the hands of goofball simpleton Baltasar (Santiago Segura) and two dwarfs. Yep, this is a Jess Franco film. Then the movie shifts focus to the Spanish rock/punk band The Killer Barbies performing at some small venue. Why is there a spelling change in the title of the film? Perhaps Ken and Barbie threatened to sue. Anyway, as the group bangs out one of its Ramones-esque tunes on stage one fact becomes glaringly obvious. The lead singer of the group, a young lady known here as Flavia but whose real world name is Silvia Superstar, is blazingly hot. The music isn't too bad, either. Then disaster sets in as the band finishes performing, loads up the requisite van, and heads off into the night destined for their next gig. Banal small talk follows for several minutes, obviously in an attempt to provide the necessary ""character"" development so we will feel something other than pure joy when the sauce starts to flow later on. With teeth grinding predictability, the van breaks down out in the middle of nowhere. Boy, what an original way to set up a scary movie! Never saw that coming, Jess!

The band members dither around trying to fix the tire when the sudden appearance of an elderly gent named Arkan (Aldo Sambrell) startles them. This friendly man invites them up to a creepy looking castle, promising to call for a tow truck. But wouldn't you know it? Assistance won't arrive until morning, so the kids will just have to spend the night in a castle so gloomy it makes Count Dracula's digs look like a Howard Johnson's hotel in Barbados. What the band doesn't know, but will soon find out, is that the owner of the castle, the Countess (Mariangela Giordano), is an Elizabeth Bathory type kook currently lounging in her bed planning another comeback. She needs the blood of the band to accomplish this feat, however, and that's where Arkan comes in. He needs to keep Flavia and her posse around long enough for the Countess to woo one of the males back to her bedroom. Of course the band soon discovers what is going on, too late to save one of their friends, and ""Killer Barbys"" becomes a race to defeat the forces of evil in order to live long enough to make it to their next performance on time. Expect to see a lot of nonsense in the meantime, including a death by steamroller, crazed dwarfs, and some genuine blood bathing.

Sigh. Aside from the ample talents of Silvia Superstar and an amazingly svelte and alluring Mariangela Giordano, ""Killer Barbys"" made we want to take a header off my barcalounger. The elderly Franco shoots firmly from the hip replacement in what must surely rank as one of the most banal zero budget bombs in Euroflick history. The movie attempts to achieve an artful blend of horror, comedy, and musical but fails on more than a few levels. Sure, it's occasionally gory. Sure, it occasionally builds an iota of atmosphere. But the attempt to garner laughs fails miserably. I never cracked a single smile during the entire film, unless a grimace counts as a grin. In fact, you'll likely find more laughs in your second cousin's four and a half hour home movie of his trip to the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota than you will with Franco's ""Killer Barbys."" Grandpa Jess should have dropped the ""comedy"" angle in favor of what he does best, namely reveling in lots of bloodshed and birthday suited babes. What keeps me up at nights is the knowledge that Franco shot a sequel a few years later entitled, horribly enough, ""Killer Barbys vs. Dracula."" I'm removing your name from my Christmas card list, Jess.

At least the extras on the disc aren't bad. We get a couple of interviews with the luscious Silvia Superstar and a fellow band member, cast and crew biographies, a lobby card gallery, a ""Scream"" Access menu, and a couple of decent music videos of the band performing a song named ""Mars"" and a version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown."" Text information on the band and trailers for ""Eaten Alive,"" ""Burial Ground,"" ""Jungle Holocaust,"" and ""Beyond the Darkness"" round out the disc. ""Killer Barbys"" is definitely a film only Jess Franco completists will want to add to their collection. For newcomers to the man with the lead covered camera lens, I recommend starting with ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""Faceless.""",1127520000,15,5499,4.730969760166841
2807310,3,B00005LMAT,"Not one of Jess Franco's better films but certainly not one of his worst either.  I would have liked to see this film directed by Franco but produced by his American company One Shot Productions.  They would have trimmed a lot of the stale time and left us with pure Jess Franco.  The story is pretty straightforward, espcially for a Franco film, with a rock band getting lost and winding up at the home a madwoman in search of human blood.  Segura and Superstar are definitely the best elements of the film.  The Killer Barbies music is especially hot! Kind of like having a female Joey Ramone singing the soundtrack. [Some trivia I learned in an interview: although this is not a One Shot Productions film by Franco, the head of One Shot Productions, Kevin Collins, actually gave the film its name when the actual producers realized that they might get sued if they called it ""Killer Barbies""!]",1050278400,6,896,4.6455696202531644
8188284,3,B00005LMAT,"Killer Barbys is a blend of horror, comedy, and music from director Jess Franco (Female Vampire, Daughter of Dracula). The Killer Barbys are a flamboyant hard rock band out on the road. On the way to their next gig, they find themselves lost and are forced to take shelter at the estate of Countess Von Fledermaus (Mariangela Giordano). Though the Countess appears to be a pleasant host, the band discovers she has a grisly secret: she feeds on the blood of virile young men to stay young. Lead singer Flavia (Silvia Superstar) is soon forced to save her male bandmates from becoming the Countess next victims.

The Killer Barbys is a real-life Spanish horror-punk band which gives this film a kind of surrealistic feel. Once the band arrives at the Countess castle, the movie turns into a fairly routine old-dark-house thriller, with the added fun of a predatory vampire on the premises. Franco was known in earlier times for his mix of sex and horror. Here, however, an extended sex scene between two band members is more awkward than erotic. He has better luck with a gruesome scene in which the Countess seduces and summarily slaughters one of her unsuspecting, hormone-driven guests.

Killer Barbys (Mattel wouldnt sell the rights for the use of the Barbie spelling) is fascinating, mostly because of its audaciousness and the blending of hard rock with horror. The band performs at the beginning of the film to showcase its talents, but as actors, they never convince. Ms. Giordano, on the other hand, is a strong screen presence and conveys the proper menace and sensuality. To keep things weird, director Franco has odd supporting characters pop up, including a mysterious caretaker and a couple of midgets he refers to as his children.

The film is newly restored from a 4K scan of the original film elements. The unrated Blu-ray release contains audio commentary by film historian Troy Howarth. The film is in Spanish, with optional English subtitles. There are both English and French language soundtrack options.",1506470400,,2024,4.964601769911504

8188290,4,B00005LMAT,"1. This is apparently a Spanish movie that has been dubbed into FRENCH and with NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES on Amazon Instant Video as of 11/8/14.  Odd, huh. Luckily, my French is better than my Spanish, and...well, I wanted to say that the dialogue is not exactly Baudelaire, except then at the end the evil vampire countess actually does start quoting Baudelaire, I'm pretty sure (it's a cut & paste of Diamanda Galas' Masque of the Red Death).

2. There's a lot of critics out there who feel that this represents director Jess Franco jumping the shark. I don't know Jess Franco from James Franco, but I came to this looking for a cheesy, kinky, bloody sub-B grade movie with few redeeming qualities and that's what I got. If you love the grainy look of Fulci-style 70s horror, this film delivers, even though it was released in 1996.",1415404800,,829,4.63265306122449
