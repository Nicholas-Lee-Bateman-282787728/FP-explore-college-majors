8019644,3,B00020HAQ0,"Third rate filming. The cars were good , but the film equipment they used was third rate. Actors not bad",1359676800,,104,4.25
8019645,1,B00020HAQ0,"This had a threadbare storyline; the characters make stupid decisions; and this film was just a waste of time.  One actor who played a simple role in ""American Me"" is put upon a pedestal and worshipped like he were Ruben Blades, Benicio del Toro, or some other major LatinO actor.  I loved the Southwest unity here where the script shows Cali, Arizona, and Texas.  There are many tomboyish girls and butch women here.  Maybe androgyny is celebrated or understood in ""cholo"" culture, but this dynamic stands out and no character ever discusses it.  Maybe I had a defective copy, but many actors' voices could not be heard.  Really, you'd heard background music, one person talking, and another person's lips just moving.  If I didn't have the subtitles on I would have had no idea what they were saying.  Maybe this is the result of low-budget films where they can't reshoot when a microphone isn't working.  Do not waste two hours of your life seeing this.  This could be the worst ""ese"" film ever made.",1158969600,,1003,4.712643678160919
