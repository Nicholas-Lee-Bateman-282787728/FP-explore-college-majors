2246159,4,B0007VY40E,"Samurai Jack, the groundbreaking animation series by Genndy Tartavosky that follows the young samurai stranded in the future, searching for his arch-nemesis, Aku, and a way back to the past, continues in the fantastic second season.

In the last DVD we were introduced to Jack, the shapeshifting wizard Aku, and many allies and foes. In Samurai Jack: Season 2, Jack's journey continues through some of the best episodes ever produced (as well as a couple that never should have been). But the good far outweighs the bad as Jack meets old friends, explores his past, and is fully realized as a warrior of honor, skill, and some good old fashioned luck.

The action reaches its peak in episodes such as XVIII (Jack and the Ultra-Robots), XXII (Jack and Imakandi), and XXIII (Jack vs Demongo, the episode that officially hooked me as a lifelong fan). Arguably some of the best action episodes of the series (out of quite a bunch!), these episodes have Jack fighting (or running) for his life before delving into his resourcefulness and inner strength for the means to defeat his foes.

Jack's almost overwhelming valor in these episodes might make for a rather two-dimensional character, but we also see moments of his vulnerability in such episodes as XIX (Jack Remembers His Past) and XX (Jack and the Monks), one of my personal favorites. In the twentieth episode, after losing yet another chance to return to the past, a disheartened Jack follows three monks up the seemingly endless, nearly impossible Mount Fatoom, only to discover anew the reasons behind his journey.

It's hard to decide whether Season 2 is the best of the series. But it is certainly a gem to be treasured, its mix of high-voltage action and personal reflection paving the way for some of Jack's greatest triumphs and worst moments of despair in the stunning Season 3.",1116288000,3,1841,4.891025641025641
2246160,5,B0007VY40E,"What can be said more. One of the greatest animation series of all time keeps getting better. I am so looking forward to these episodes:

XXXI (Jack and the Scarab)

One intense fighting episodes

XXXV (Jack and the Haunted House)

Great artistic switch to pencil and shadow drawing in the demon world

XL (Samurai vs. Ninja)

Fantastic martial art showdown

XXIV (Jack is Naked)

One trippy psychedelic episode",1112918400,4,411,4.9411764705882355
2246161,4,B0007VY40E,"It has been much too long between the DVD releases of Samurai Jack Season 1 and Season 2 (due out May 24, 2005). Season 2 has some of the very best Samurai Jack episodes, including:

* Episode 14 - Jack learns to ""jump good"" thanks to the help of an ape-man and a tribe of his fellow apes. This has some great scenes of Jack in training and as Jack in turn teaches his new friends to defend themselves.
* Episode 18 - Jack has to battle a posse of assasin robots. Once again, Jack must prove - to himself, more than anyone - that his heart is greater than any enemy Aku can throw at him.
* Episode 19 - Jack stumbles upon his ancestral land, now in ruins. This has some heartwarming flashbacks of Jack's life as a little boy.
* Episode 20 - Jack and the Mountain. Jack joins three monks in a death-defying climb up a mystical mountain. Are these the spirits of the monks who created Jack's samurai sword? : )
* Episode 22 - Jack battles three lion-men...the greatest wild-game hunter team in the galaxy. The stalker-prey chase gives Jack his toughest challenge of skill to date.

So why the 4 stars? There are a few other episodes that fall too short of Samurai Jack at his best. In one episode in this series Jack encounters a village cursed with a vile smell. The episode is strange, gross, and just a little offensive. In another episode, Jack takes part in three so-so fairy tales amongst his many journeys. This episode just lacks the umph you come to expect from Samurai Jack.

However, just the episodes listed above (especially Episodes 18 & 19) make this DVD worth the price. I've been waiting for these episodes since the release of Season 1. Finally, it's almost here.",1112659200,32,1679,4.409677419354839
2246162,5,B0007VY40E,"Well, this is the volume that tens of thousands of die-hard fans have been waiting for, and judging from the excellent quality of the first set this one is a no-brainer for any aficionado of animation; asian or north american.

  Continuing his quest to return to his home in the past and vanquish the evil that exile him, Samurai Jack treks the world over, encountering the strange and powerful alike.

  Held together with an unlikely combination of highly stylized directing and geometric visuals, Samurai Jack offers a brand of animation literally not found in any other series.  While the analogies have been made before, they bear repating: if you like old spaghetti westerns, bizarre sci-fi, episodic storytelling or just plain frenetic action this is certainly the series for you.",1111363200,16,788,5.062015503875969

2246201,5,B0007VY40E,"This is a continuation of a rather excellent series. While one can see clearly is Season one, Jack is learning his way around this rather strange landscape into which he has been thrown, Season Two, is a little more introspective, sometimes playful and even a bit strange, yet each story is excellently done with action and adventure. It starts off with a friendly Monkey Man who, with the help of his tribe, teaches Jack how to ""Jump Good."" A series of short tales and then, The Scotsman returns, seeking help to  rescue his kidnapped wife. The True clinker here seems to be the ""Farting Dragon"" while a strange and even odd tale is reminiscent of ""Alice in Wonderland"" where Jack must chase a white rabbit in order to get back his clothes and sword. A small ode to the 300 Spartans in which Jack discovers a small group of warriors pitted against an enormous army of robotic minotaurs. When his footwear is destroyed he discovers that its hard to fight without the right shoes. He also learns a valuable lesson in climbing a mountain about patience and perseverance when he accompanies three monks. Each story is a one of a kind and very well done...",1404604800,,1152,4.619512195121951

2246216,5,B0007VY40E,"Jack is back & better than ever.  This season contains 9 of the 14 episodes that were my introduction to Samurai Jack.  I marked them with an asterisk.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the box.

*14.  Jack Learns to Jump Good:  Monkey-man teaches Jack how to ""jump good.""  Pretty entertaining.  B+

15.  Jack Tales:  3 stories.  Story 1: Jack vs. the Worm.  Story 2:  The Metal-Eaters.  Story 3:  Jack, the Gargoyle and the Fairy.  A good range of stories.  A-

*16.  Jack & the Smackback:  Jack is forced to battle in front of a coliseum audience against the Dome of Doom's champions.  The action in this episode is great.  A

17.  The Scotsman Returns:  The Scotsman needs Jack's help to save his kidnapped wife.  The Scotsman's second episode is just as hilarious as his first.  A+

*18.  Jack & the Ultra-Robots:  Jack searches for the ultra-robots who have destroyed several villages, only to find they have been commissioned by Aku.  The first episode my sister my aunt & I ever saw.  It's really good but not what I would recommend for a first-time viewer.  A+

*19.  Jack Remembers the Past:  Jack comes across the ruins of a village & realizes it is his home.  A beautifully done episode.  A+

*20.  Jack and the Monks:  Jack travels vertically up a mountain with 3 monks to witness the magic of the mountain.  Not my favorite, but still above average.  A-

21.  Jack & the Farting Dragon:  Jack follows his nose to find a flatulent dragon fouling the air of an entire village.  This is a very funny & wonderfully weird episode.  A+

22. Jack & the Hunters:  Aku hires the best hunters in the galaxy to track down the most elusive of prey - Samurai Jack.  This was a very exciting episode.  A+

*23.  Jack VS Demongo: Aku sends out Demongo, the soul collector, to destroy Jack.  Demongo is one of the greatest antagonists in the whole series.  A+

*24.  Jack Is Naked:  When Jack's sword & clothing are stolen, he must give chase to the white rabbit who stole them, while trying to hide his nudity.  Not the best of the comedy episodes, but not bad.  B

*25.  Jack & the Spartans:  Jack comes upon a battle where a mere 300 men are fighting a vast, unending army of robots & their evil leader.  This awesome episode won them an Emmy.  A+

*26.  Jack's Sandals:  When a band of bikers mow over Jack's sandals, he goes on a hunt for the perfect footwear.  The quote in the title of this review is from this episode.  Scotsman episodes aside, this is my all-time favorite comedy episode of the show.  A+

It's like Genndy Tartakovsky himself said in his little written message included for this season.  ""I felt we really started to explore more of Jack's character & began to hone in on the elements a good Jack episode needs to have.""  Couldn't have said it better myself Genndy.  God bless you for this wonderful animated series, especially this season!  At worst this is still my second favorite season of the show.",1368230400,,2947,4.487571701720841
2246217,3,B0007VY40E,"I've give this 4 stars but being only SD, I gave it 3.

This is the 2nd season of Samurai Jack, the story about the Samurai thrown into the future and his quest to get back. If you have already seen season 1 then this is more of the same (in a good way), there are some classic episodes in this season including the very first one, Jump Good (one of my all time favs).

This is also the season where they tried to make some campy/funny episodes like ""Jack is Naked"" where he runs around all over the place looking for his clothes or ""Jacks Footwear"" where he sandels are destroyed and he goes on a quest for the perfect footwear (seeing Jack in sneakers is worth the episode alone).",1366761600,,682,4.198473282442748

But this season seems to just be more on the comical side, don't get me wrong, it still has its complete action episodes, like ""Jack and The Hunters"" and ""Jack and the Smack Back"" But theirs a lot more of ""comical"" episodes, like ""Jack and The Farting Dragon,"" ""Jack Is Naked,"" and ""Jack's Sandals"" but this season is probably the weakest one for Samurai Jack. It's still a great season, just the weaker one out of all the SJ seasons. But if you're a big fan of SJ you'll love it regardless.

My favorite episodes:

Jack Remembers The Past, Jack and The Hunters, Jack And The Spartans, and Jack's Sandals (It's pretty funny.)

Both graphically and story-wise everything seems much poorer, less surprising and less fun, less researched than on the first season.

If you're a fan go ahead, this is still above average, but if you're looking for really outstanding stuff well you won't find anything better than season 1 here.
I'd rather recommend you to check out Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, which is sweet, funny and sometimes emotional, and looks totally amazing.

2246238,5,B0007VY40E,"IMHO, the drama that sells the whole DVD is the episode where Aku creates horrific assasin robots in an attempt to defeat Jack.  The robots indiscriminately massacre the innocent and helpless to leave a trail of butchery that will lead jack to them.  Due to it being on Cartoon Network, the worst gore scenes, like a city of impaled beings, were robots, but it still has the effect.

The tribute to the soon to be made into a movie ""300"" by Frank Miller is a close second.  And there's humor, the ""Jump Good"" episode, the re-uniting with the Scotsman, and Jack's search for replacement footwear.",1170028800,,595,4.6380952380952385

2246243,5,B0007VY40E,"As far as American animation goes,(as in comparison to Japanese Anime)it has a lot weaker history to look back to. This animation leaves the constraints of normal American cartoons for the semi-traditional samurai anime style. The first time I watched this, I was blown away! The drawings and settings are fantastic, and the music is some of the best ever made for cartoons. The plot is direct and constant, but still leaves room for wild twists with all sorts of enemies. As a whole, one of the best American cartoons in history!",1143504000,,530,4.771739130434782
2246244,5,B0007VY40E,"The second season is where Samurai Jack and the series really becomes great.  This is where Jack learns to jump, falls down a hole into Wonderland, fights for the honor of his sandals, flees the best hunters in the galaxy, robot assassins, and Demongo, a collector of souls.  He fights in the Dome of DOOM, helps 300 Spartans defeat an army of evil robots and a mountain helps him defeat his own inner demons.  He has to deal with a gargoyle, help the Scotsman save his own wife and has to deal with the feelings that the ruins of his old home bring about.  Lone Wolf and Club even make an appearance!

Each and every episode is a hit.  Add the extras which include one commentary, a pitch (where an artist tries to sell an idea to the others) and the scrapbook which is a small short about where Genndy Tartakovsky came from, where he got his ideas and even about his family.",1137715200,,876,4.343558282208589

Each Wed evening after the kids were in bed, my friends and I would get ""kitchen passes"" from our respective wives and gather to watch two episodes.  Amazing animation (perspectives, contrast, etc.), superb direction, excellent music, and great storytelling (and best seen in the ""appropriate"" frame of mind).  I withdrew the fifth star only because the manufcturers chinced on the high sound quality the original offered.  Hopefully, they'll do better with Season 3.

2246247,3,B0007VY40E,"As far as animated series are concerned, as a whole, Samurai Jack Season 2 is very entertaining.  However, it simply doesn't match up to Season 1.

The main things I loved about Season 1 -- and thought made this series so unique -- were absent from Season 2.  I loved the gradual pace, how it was not as chatty as other cartoons and each episode was like its own novel.

Season 2, while action-packed and still visually appealing, just doesn't draw me in and is not as mature as the first season.  I almost felt like the writers were scrapped for ideas.  Most of all, the funny, wicked villain Aku was thoroughly under-used.",1128038400,5,624,4.477876106194691

2246249,5,B0007VY40E,"Glad to see I was wrong. Thing is I don't have the Cartoon Network. We only have YTV and Teletoon here and they're not particularly good. I rented the Samurai Jack Premiere Movie and liked it so on a whim I bought the Season 2 set and it's actually a really good show.

In season 1, Samurai Jack was in old day Japan battling the shape-shifting demon Aku. During a fight, Aku creates a time portal which propels Jack into the future where Aku is even more powerful. So the show is basically about Jack wanting to get back to his own time and defeat Aku.

With season 2, it's basically episodic in nature. Not a lot plot-wise happens such as a companion or even a rival that isn't the main villain(similar to Him from Powerpuff Girls, when it's normally Mojo Jojo). The show is really episodic in other things too. Season opener finds Jack learning how to jump incredibly high. I haven't seen him use it again, even in one episode when he scales a mountain. He could easily clear this mountain in 2-3 jumps.

The show does excel at one thing though: style, and it showcases it in spades. The show's unique animation blends with almost movie-like angles, even employing widescreen-style and split-screen. There's even 4-screens and many other styles. This gives the show a nice unique quality you don't tend to get with other shows.

The voice actors also do a good job, despite the fact it's not a really word-y show. Phil LaMarr(Hermes and others from Futurama, or Marvin in Pulp Fiction ""I shot Marvin in the face!"") does a great Jack having a really calm in-control tone. Others tend to guest star or provide small voices such as John DiMaggio(Bender from Futurama, Wakka from Final Fantasy X).

It's a really stylish show, occasionally funny without being obvious(such as my other favorite Powerpuff Girls which is designed as an obvious comedy animated show), Samurai Jack is like art film in cartoon form.",1125187200,5,1910,4.6726190476190474
2246250,4,B0007VY40E,"""Jack"" still remains the best animated series to come out in recent years. Sure, the Justice League is enjoyable entertainement but Jack is the freshest thing to come out in a long time!

The stories continue to be new and refresshing and unlike the above mentioned animated series this is not your usual super hero series. The artwork is so completely differnet that naytthing else out there today and Aku is the best villian crerated for the little screen yet!

2246256,2,B0007VY40E,"I've always been a fan of Samurai Jack. I watched it all the time on Cartoon Network and was disappointed when it was never on anymore. I think Phil Lamar does a great job with it. Season one was great and well worth the money.

However...

Season 2, in my opinion, was a bit of a let down. I only recognized the episode with the Scott's wife (so funny) and I could not even make it through disc one in a single sitting. I found the other episodes boring and to be over all much less visually impressive and well written than season one. I haven't watched disc 2 yet because I'm afraid it will be just as bad. But if you are truly much more devoted to the show than I am, maybe you'll enjoy most of them. But personally, I feel the producers just scrambled to make deadlines more than to create great animation.",1121126400,2,811,4.1923076923076925
2246257,4,B0007VY40E,"The second Samurai Jack season is probably as good as the first !  It has the next 13 episodes along with a commentary on ""Jack and the Spartans"", an episode pitch, and Mr. Tartakofsky's scrapbook of the show.  Very nice.

My top five episodes for the second season are:

5. ""Jack and the Dragon"" - A village is being plagued by a very foul stench.  It turned out that it was coming from a dragon with a really bad stomach-ache.  Jack goes inside the dragon to find the source of the problem.

4. ""Jack Remembers the Past"" (a.k.a. ""Memories of Home"") - Jack sees ruins of a city and suddenly reminices his days when he was a young boy.

3. ""Jack vs. Demongo"" - Aku sends out a new villain to destroy Samurai Jack: the soul stealer, Demongo.

2. ""Jack's Shoes"" - A band of bikers run over Jack's favorite pair of sandals.  Jack re-enters the futuristic city and discovers a shoe store.  Now he must battle the bikers with some formidable (and funny) footwear.

1. ""Jack in Wonderland"" (a.k.a. ""Jack is Naked"") - A little white rabbit swipes Jack's robe and sword.  Jack and his naked self fall down a hole and end up in a very strange new world where he winds up in all sorts of misadventures.  (Note: some of the background music used in this episode is also used in the Dexter's Laboratory episode where Dee Dee's stuffed animals come to life)

Honorable mention: ""Jack Tales""(a.k.a. ""Jack and the Worm/The Metal Eaters/Jack, the Fairy, and the Gargoyle"") - The gregarious Samurai narrates a trio of tales where he meets a giant two-headed worm, a family of metal eaters, and a fairy being held captive by a gargoyle.

If you thought the first and second season was good, just wait till the third season comes out !",1121126400,,1716,4.487096774193549
2246258,5,B0007VY40E,"The tale of Samurai Jack is a deep one, permeated with a sharp visual style that doesn't rely solely on it's animation to entertain.  The first season was fantastic and in terms of quality, this 2nd season is no different.

The character of Samurai Jack will amaze you with his perseverance, courage and skill.  He's quite the heroic character...inspirational for people in real life to never give up no matter what the odds.

The special features include a fairly amusing creator scrapbook of Genndy Tartakovsky.  It gives an informative look at the life and career of Samurai Jack's creator and is worth watching.

With all that being said, I found the 'wow' factor in this season to be marginally lower than that of the first season.  Perhaps it's because I didn't love ALL the episodes like I did the first season.  Episodes XXI and XXIV here failed to impress me, although XXIV's ending had a decent twist.

Samurai Jack is still one of my personal favorite shows of all time.  It has qualities rarely seen out of the finest motion pictures; genuinely exciting action, emotional drama and a healthy dose of lighthearted humor.  All this in a simple cartoon series.",1119398400,11,1169,4.795
2246259,5,B0007VY40E,"Samurai Jack is the cutting edge of creativity.  There is no doubt that on some episodes, such as the farting dragon episode, there is a different tone and direction.  However, it shows that Tartakovsky is willing to go out on a limb.  He is daring to do something different from other shows (cartoon or not).  This difference is the divide between Samurai Jack and Naruto.  Don't get me wrong, I love Naruto, but it lacks what nearly every T.V. show, or even movie lacks-risk.  Tartakovsky is creating a legacy much like Tarantino and Zhang Yimou (Director of Hero and House of Flying Dagger).  Make no mistake, Samurai Jack, in every season that will be released, will be impressive and different from each other.  I personally cannot wait until the third and fourth seasons however, the Spartans episode, Emikandi Hunters, Jack Naked, Jack and the Ultra Robots, and Jack Remembers the Past offer up some of the most diverse Samurai Jack episodes.  And it only gets better from here.",1117065600,2,985,4.815476190476191
