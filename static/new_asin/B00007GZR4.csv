1810339,4,B00007GZR4,"I am a Burns and Allen fan.  So, I watched these to see them.  Yes, they were good, as I had expected.  What I did not expect was the pleasant surprise from some of the other actors and performers.

In Here Comes Cookie, my favorite parts were the seal and the man who drummed on everything.  You just do not see seals very often any more and the drummer was simply fantastic.  Overall it was a cute movie that I would watch again.  I would give it four stars.

I know that I saw Love in Bloom yesterday, but I can not remember a single scene from it.  So, it must have not been that memorable, which means that it was neither good nor bad.  I will give it three stars.  Most likely I won't watch it again.

In Six of a Kind, Charlie Ruggles did the best acting job, overall.  I had never watched a W.C. Fields movie before.  He really cracked me up as a pool playing sheriff.  In fact, I intend to make a point to see other works of his, because of that one scene in this movie. I give it 4 stars.  I would watch this one again, also.

I also enjoying watching these for the costumes and the period clothing that the characters wear.  Everyone dressed so glamorous, even the out of work performers, the homeless, and the drunks on the side of the road were impeccably dressed.  Amazing, isn't it?  Wow!  Things have really changed.",1187913600,2,1332,4.2063492063492065
1810340,3,B00007GZR4,"Paramount was a haven in the thirties for radio and vaudeville stars and many of their smaller films of the period preserve the work of these performers at their peaks. This DVD contains 3 programmers, films in support of the main feature, which provide a worthwhile record of the tick-tock timing of the beloved George Burns and Gracie Allen.

In ""Six of a Kind"", they play a couple who hitch a ride to California with Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland who are trying to celebrate their second honeymoon. When Gracie is dizzy, if the jokes are not corny, she can be very funny but when she is immune to the discomfort she causes around her, as she often is here, she can be unsympathetic and downright irritating. Charlie Ruggles holds the film together but the film peaks when W C Fields enters as a local sheriff - 4 stars.

""Here Comes Cookie"" places Gracie centre stage in a weak screwball comedy. She plays the dizzy daughter of a millionaire who feigns poverty to rid his other daughter of a fortune hunter fiancee. Gracie turns the house into a haven for down and out vaudeville acts which gives an excuse to put on a show. Often in these films, there will be a standout moment and in this one, there is a terrific act with a drummer and Gracie performs an amusing song number, demonstrating that she was a competent singer when she discarded some of the nonsense - 2 stars.

""Love in Bloom"" is a depression story set in New York. Dixie Lee, Bing Crosby's wife, plays a down and out showgirl. Lee sounds like Jean Harlow and acts like the early snappy Ginger Rogers. She meets a songwriter also down on his luck and the film depicts their burgeoning romance in a surprisingly credible series of events. Once again, the film has an unexpected gem: the songwriter is played by a long forgotten tenor, Joe Morrison, who delivers an unforgettable moment singing ""None but the Lonely Heart"". George and Gracie, in supporting roles, play carnival performers and the film also contains the best routine of all of the films - their encounter with a policeman as they drive to New York. Not only is Gracie's lack of logic hilarious, but she subtly implies she knows what she is doing as she cons the policeman - perfection! - 3 stars

The prints of the films are good and the set contains the theatrical trailer of ""Six of a Kind"" but no other extras, which is reasonable at the price.",1186704000,9,2382,4.545454545454546
1810341,4,B00007GZR4,"GEORGE BURNS AND GRACIE ALLEN: THREE MOVIES is a wildly uneven collection of Depression era comedies.  The Paramount studio print masters look and sound gorgeous, and the packaging is attractive.  All three movies come on one side of one disk, which presented no technical problem for me.  It is easy to go from one movie to another.

HERE COMES COOKIE (1935--****) is a good introduction to the comedy of George Burns and Gracie Allen because they play themselves and have the lead roles.  George is straight man to Gracie's screwball pun mistakes.  In Depression era Manhattan, millionaire George Barbier stupidly entrusts his entire fortune to Gracie (!), so she naturally (for her) invites all of the unemployed drama actors in the city to her mansion.  There must be a hundred of them, eating and playing musical instruments constantly.  George can't take a bath because there is a live seal on ice in the tub!  At the climax, Gracie has carpenters tear the place apart to transform the house into a theater.  This is a wonderful and nutty comedy, only 65 minutes.

SIX OF A KIND (1935--*****) is a zany delight with six major stars given almost equal time over a tight and fast 62 minutes.  Charlie Ruggles and wife Mary Boland want to drive from New York to Hollywood.  George Burns, Gracie Allen, and Gracie's pet German shepherd answer their ad for companions to share gas money.  Unknown to Ruggles, he is falsely accused of being an embezzler, and the movie gets no further than a dusty Nevada town.  There, the town's major hotel is run by W.C. Fields (who even gets to play pool in one scene) and Alison Skipworth, who are always welcome.  SIX OF A KIND was directed by Leo McCarey, who had Laurel and Hardy silents behind him and GOING MY WAY a decade ahead of him.  This one is a comedy gem.

LOVE IN BLOOM (1935--**)--is, alas, a dud with Burns and Allen badly miscast as a husband and wife traveling circus act who take a back seat to a mediocre young lovers subplot.  Dixie Lee (Mrs. Bing Crosby) plays George's sister, who falls in love with struggling songwriter Joe Morrison.  Too often Burns and Allen take a backseat to Dixie and Joe.  One good song:  ""My Heart is an Open Book.""  There are far better Burns and Allen movies, including the other two movies on this disk.

The only real bonuses are two theatrical trailers.  I wish Universal would add some new filmmaking and vintage comedy/drama shorts, even if they have to charge a bit more than $12.95.  The front cover includes three color lobby cards.  Rent this disk and only watch the first two movies.",1185494400,24,2582,4.654867256637168

I was not at all disappointed,and enjoyed all three of the movies on this DVD.Definetly worth viewing. Gracie's misunderstanding logic just cracks me up. Incidently I found George to be higher strung in these films than he was in""The Burns And Allen Show"".

1810345,3,B00007GZR4,"Vaudeville and radio stars George Burns and Gracie Allen seldom starred in their movies; they were usually comedy relief or part of an all-star format. This DVD features the only two ""Burns & Allen"" features, and at times you'll think they're merely guest stars, because they aren't always the center of attention.
HERE COMES COOKIE (which does NOT feature the hit tune of that name) has tycoon George Barbier discouraging fortune hunters, by temporarily entrusting his money to scatterbrained Gracie, much to secretary George's consternation. Gracie promptly turns the mansion into a theatrical flophouse! You might be scratching your head at some of this -- it wanders from scene to scene haphazardly and sometimes abruptly -- but there are some good gags and Gracie sings a Latin number, ""The Vamp of the Pampas."" A fun little quickie, accent on ""little.""
LOVE IN BLOOM (which does not feature the title song but DOES feature ""Here Comes Cookie"" sung by Gracie -- typical Gracie Allen logic!) is the story of hard-boiled Dixie Lee (Mrs. Bing Crosby) and softhearted Joe Morrison trying to get along in the big city. Joe Morrison (in a role perhaps intended for Bing) has a pleasant manner and a very easy way with dialogue; he should have gone farther in pictures. Burns & Allen are the nominal stars but they appear only occasionally as a couple of carnival employees.
SIX OF A KIND is a 63-minute exercise in frustration directed by Leo McCarey. Burns & Allen play traveling companions from hell, who make a cross-country automobile trip miserable for Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland. W. C. Fields and Alison Skipworth are seen in the second half as a shifty sheriff and a hotel proprietor. Director McCarey concentrates on all the cruel and terrible complications, making Gracie unsympathetic instead of charming. Fields does his celebrated ""pool table"" routine, but it's Charlie Ruggles who steals the film with his understated reactions and remarks.
Universal deserves applause for releasing these seldom-seen comedies from the vault. The three features are all on one single-sided disc, with no apparent loss in quality. Movie buffs will enjoy the set; those who only care about George and Gracie will have to sit through (or fast-forward through) a lot of other stuff, but the Burns & Allen routines are worth waiting for. Excellent picture and sound quality throughout.",1073606400,62,2380,5.073979591836735
1810356,5,B00007GZR4,"Yes, back when these films were made, the local movie house was filled to overthrowing with the kids, who, for 11 cents, sat for three or four hours (about the duration of these three films combined) through a double feature, plus cartoons, newsreel, coming attractions and, more than occasionally, periods when the films were stopped so that ushers could walk through collecting for charities, such as the Film Actors Retirement Home, or less parochial ones. The length of these pictures, made in the mid-30's, indicate that these were the second feature on the bill, with some A contract players, serving their time as stars of B films. What we get to see in these today, are such things as, what supporting vaudeville acts looked like, some bits from Fields and Burns & Allen of top acts, Charlie Ruggles showing why character actors were known to carry many a picture, how little gems of songs were dropped into vehicles to serve their day and be forgotten, and,a look at an ingenue, Dixie Lee, at about 23 years of age, who had a fine start but disappeared into marriage with the most successful star of the day  (Bing Crosby), mental disorder, child-bearing and raising, and an early death (saving her from the pain of two boys committing suicide and another, in the midst of career failure, drug addiction, alcoholism, and marital failure, savaging his dead father for the sake of the money he could get out of it).
Truth to tell, while I much enjoyed Six of a Kind, which I last saw in a small movie house in NYC, almost half-century ago, one of the films which B & A shared with Fields, and enjoyed the vaudeville flavor of Here Comes Cookie, typical of many films of the late 20's, 30's and 40's, still it was Love in Bloom (named for one of the many great hits that Crosby was rolling out almost daily in those days) that really made this disc for me. Hokey, of course. sentimental, naturally, subordinating B & A to the little love story, what else?, but still the sight and the sound of Dixie Lee, the sound of her film boyfriend, the song of two transplanted Tin Pan Alley-ites, and one or two of the B & A mini-routines, gave me pure, and, yes, to say it again, sentimental, pleasure.
How younger people will react I cannot say. It is a bargain price for filling part of a couple of night's entertainment bill.",1342915200,2,2325,4.575539568345324
1810357,4,B00007GZR4,"The years never tarnish her. ""Cookie"" is the quintessential Gracie. Her timing is always immaculate, and she singlehandedly carries every scene. George was very lucky he found her.",1274313600,3,180,5.464285714285714
1810358,4,B00007GZR4,"Got this for ""Six of a Kind"" to add to my W.C. Fields collection, even though Fields is only in the last half of the movie.  The other 2 Burns and Allen movies are a nice added bonus. DVD was in excellent condition and service was prompt.",1265414400,,238,4.0638297872340425
1810359,3,B00007GZR4,"Universal has released onto DVD three from the vaults;Here comes Cookie(Sept./35),Six of a Kind(Feb/34) and Love in Bloom(April/35).All dusted off and looking very good after all these years,the films are a welcome sight and gives modern audiences a chance to see George Burns and his beloved wife Gracie Allen. Many times in the ensuing years after Gracies' passing from us in 1964,George Burns would tell audiences she had been the heart and soul of the act. She indeed HAD been that and that is why it is so nice to be able to see this oh so talented lady once again,whatever the vehicle she is in. Gracies character was one that talked like Betty Boop and had a head full of air;but she was always lovable and always had the best of intentions. George Burns on the other hand played the put-upon and sometimes bamboozled partner. George was really her straight man and set up the gags and situations for Gracie. They were a headlining act in vaudeville for years and they successfully parlayed it into the theater,the stage and later television;and audiences loved them. Though these offerings are just middle of the roaders,they offer us a glimpse of the two in their prime and the duo never fail to please and more importantly,amuse.
Here comes Cookie,gives us George as an assistant to a millionaire by the name of Harrison Allen(George Barbier).His daughter Phyllis(Betty Furness)is being pursued by a latin ""lover"" who is just after her inheritance. Harrison decides that the best thing to do,in order to expose his true colours, is to give all his money to his other daughter Gracie. Gracie is to tell no one,while father goes back to his old hometown leaving her in charge. Big mistake. Gracie of course takes everything to the letter and beyond. She snips and tears all the house staffs clothing to simulate being poor,she fills the house with out of work show biz acts, and fails to send her father ANY money whatsoever and who actually becomes poor. Insanity prevails throughout the house as the butler is even forced to sleep outside on a park bench due to a lack of accommodations. Then Gracie strikes on an idea to put all her guests to work,so she transforms the house into a theater. Her father makes it back home,no thanks to Gracie,and although horrified by what he finds he nevertheless cannot argue with the utter success of the show. The latin has since shifted gears and has been wooing Gracie,but when Phyllis sees that her father was right,he is unceremoniously booted from the premises. All ends happily as George reluctantly(through pressure from the father) agrees to marry Gracie.
This film gives Burns and Allen alot to play with but overall this really highlights Gracie and she runs with it. Turning the house into a home for stray actors makes for many hilarious on screen moments,especially as George and the butler(Andrew Tombes)try to lead as normal a life as they can under the increasingly insane circumstances.
Six of a Kind stars the pair along with Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as Mr and Mrs. Whinney,WC Fields as Sheriff Hoxley and Allison Skipworth as Mrs. Rumford,a hotel owner. Mr & Mrs. Whinney are in bad need of a vacation and so they plan one for themselves. The missus puts an ad in the paper for two people to come along with them to their destination in California. As the car is packed Mr Whinney discovers the ad has been answered by George,Gracie and their pet Great Dane. Off they go but Mr. Whinney unknowingly has had one of his bags switched. He works at a local bank and a fellow employee planning to steal 50 grand from them gets the idea to make the switch,then collect the money later where the Whinneys are staying. However due to the Whinney's passengers,the well ""advertised"" itinerary was changed. Through a series of ""occurrences"" the Whinneys financial situation gets precariously low and Mr Whinney wires his employers for money. However the missing bank money has been noticed and the bank execs thinks Mr Whinney is the culprit. The police and the employee(who really stole the cash)are in a race to reach the Whinney's first. At the hotel the owner has found the stolen money and she informs the local Sheriff,but not trusting him she removes the cash in the night and flees to get the authorities out of town. With the cash gone the Sheriff conducts a big ""Investigation"",his biggest suspect Mr Whinney,who by this time is at his wits end. In the end the employee who has beaten the outside authorities to the hotel has inadvertently gotten himself captured,through no help of the Sheriff.
This movie has many humourous  moments with veteran actors Charles Ruggles and WC Fields. Ruggles plays the put upon and frustrated husband to a tee and his delivery was an area in which he was a master of. What from many actors would have been mediocre and flat,Ruggles could breathe life into the most mundane of material and give it a life of its own. WC Fields is here showing off some of his famous vaudeville routines and the pool scene is certainly one of his classics. His turn as the bungling Sheriff who manages to make good even though he is screwing up time and again,and  knows it,is great stuff to watch. The movie was directed by ex-Roach man Leo McCarey and he brought some Roach stalwarts over to appear in this one such as the two crooks who rob the Whinneys(Walter Long,one of them) and there's a cameo by Harry Bernard,wearing a visor.
Lastly Love in Bloom stars Dixie Lee(Bing Crosbys first wife) as Violet Downey. Her father is a circus owner(a drinker at that)but tired of the life,she runs away to the big city to get away from it all. George and Gracie are two fellow performers who are sent by the father to locate her for money he needs from her. When the two arrive back with the money,sans Violet,he sends them back. In the meantime Violet has met up with an aspiring singer Larry Deane(Joe Morrison).They both get a job in a music shop run by Pop Heinrich(Lee Kolmar),who over time takes the two under his wing and all become very close. Violet keeps her circus past hidden as long as she can and it almost comes out more than a few times. The father finally shows up at a wedding,not theirs,and makes a fool of himself(drunk) by interrupting the ceremony. It is then revealed that Violet is his daughter and that he wants her back at the circus,back to her own world where she belongs. Time passes and while Violet is getting by in her old circus routine,Larry has finally hit the big time. Never having forgotten his love for her,he returns to do two things:buy the circus Violet works in and to take his love away and finally do what they had always wanted to do;get married.
George and Gracie have the least amount of screen time in this film and are used here as comic relief,and nothing much more. There are only a few good moments and one is a cute scene in Pops music store where Gracie tries to sell the store back to Pops! The love story played out between Lee and Morrison is played actually rather well done and without too much sentimentality,so it at least manages to keep some semblance of interest.
Technically these films have been transferred wonderfully. The prints are crisp and the contrast wonderful. There are no special features included and the films have been put on one disc,one side.
If some are wondering why Universal would be distributing Paramount films the reason lies in the late /50s when Paramount sold hundreds upon hundreds of titles to Universal,made between /29 and /49.
In conclusion,all in all a nice trio of movies but not alot more than average fare is here. Love in Bloom will be of less interest due to George and Gracie being a less of a force than in the others,but the story still manages to please nonetheless. The two that vie for top spot here are Here comes Cookie and Six of a Kind. My vote is for the latter in the number one spot as there is just so many more comic moments provided by some great screen veterans in this one. However despite what one may or may not think of a particular film,it is ALWAYS a joy to see George Burns and especially his lovely off-screen wife Gracie Allen together again. The character which Gracie honed to perfection was loved by millions and was the heart,soul and light of the Burns and Allen act. They just do not make them like that anymore. I recommend these films to not only those who remember Burns and Allen but to new fans,so they make catch some of the humourous ""magic"" they so warmly created.",1264809600,2,8493,4.657561625582945
1810360,4,B00007GZR4,"This DVD compilation of three movies in which George Burns & Gracie Allen appear is a mixed blessing. Their screwball comic patter was as precise as a well-oiled machine. Burns was a master of efficient straightman timing reacting & feeding lines to his partner, Allen. Allen was a bright-eyed scatterbrain with a dinstinct voice. She had, as Burns put it, her own brand of ""illogical logic""---the unique gift of making the screwiest statement seem inexplicably sound. Even when Burns insulted her, she managed to turn it all around (Burns: ""Gracie, you're idiotic!"" Allen: ""Oh George, you don't have to flatter me!""). Their type of comedy excelled in other mediums such as radio & television, but they hold their own fairly well here.
""Love in Bloom"" is a curious choice, as George & Gracie get top billing but take a back seat to a syrupy romantic plot between Dixie Lee (Mrs. Bing Crosby) & Joe Morrison through most of the picture. B&A manage to score some funny comedy routines as carnies during the picture, but they're few & far between. This is the weakest offering in the compilation. ""Six of a Kind"" is the most familiar title of the bunch, a sort-of screwball ""road"" comedy helmed by comedy pro Leo McCarey & starring a great ensemble cast. A bank employee (Charlie Ruggles) & his wife (Mary Boland) take off on a road trip heading West. However, the trip soon comes unraveled when Boland gives another couple (B&A) a ride (with their ox of a dog!), and a crooked co-worker stashes $50,000 in one of Ruggles' suitcases, making him an unknowing accomplice to the crime. Naturally, the trip doesn't get very far: It stalls at a hole-in-the-wall town run by Sheriff (the legendary W.C. Fields) & hotel manager (the terrific character actress Alison Skipworth). Highlights are the two couples getting robbed when they ask two vagrants for directions; Gracie inadvertently causing Boland to fall off a cliff during picture taking (she's saved by a branch); Fields trying to sell Burns everything else but what he wants at a store; and Fields playing a hilariously unforgettable round of pool (he doesn't even break the set!). ""Here Comes Cookie"" is the picture that finally serves as an ideal vehicle for B&A's antics. A kind of ""screwball comedy in high society"" movie, it has a father deciding to retire & signing over his wealth to his dizzy daughter (played by Gracie, of course!). Soon, advisor Burns is up in arms as he watches Gracie (who's convinced they're really bankrupt) turn the house into a ""crazy house"" filled with ragged clothes, unemployed actors, and a seal in the bathtub. When she converts the house into a theatre, the exasperated father catches word & comes home to finally put an end to the insanity.
Again, not always B&A at their best, but it's still enjoyable!",1253664000,3,2793,4.845188284518828
1810361,5,B00007GZR4,"I can't add much to what has already been written about these films, except to say that this is a good package. ""Six of a Kind"" is probably the most famous of the lot, and rightly so, as it stars the Great Man himself, W.C. Fields. And the supporting cast isn't too shabby, either. Burns and Allen, Charlie Ruggles, Mary Boland, and Alison Skipworth. Pretty much the cream of Paramount Studios (circa 1934), contract players. Fields and Skipworth always played well together (see, especially, ""If I Had a Million,"" in the famous car-wrecking segment). I love George and Gracie, but Gracie is actually a little over-the-top annoying here. You really feel for Charlie and Mary, putting up with them (and their dog). Once they get to Fields' domain, things really pick up. The classic pool routine, monologues, etc. Great stuff. And a great director to boot.

  I think ""Here Comes Cookie"" is the weakest film of the lot. George and Gracie are always fun, but the film doesn't have much substance to it. But anything coming out of that Studio-era has its good points, and Paramount was at a peak that year (see ""The Crusades,"" ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer,"" ""Goin' to Town,"" ""The Devil is a Woman,"" ""Hands Across the Table,"" ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze,"" etc.). So it is a light, fun film.

  I echo what another reviewer said about ""Love in Bloom,"" that it is a pleasant surprise. I actually found myself liking the love story more than the comedy, which is highly unusual for these kinds of films. This is because of the two charming leads, Joe Morrison and Dixie Lee. Morrison has been largely forgotten today, but I believe he was a popular radio singer at the time. He starred with W.C. Fields in ""The Old-Fashioned Way,"" and a few other forgotten films. He is very personable, and has a beautiful voice. Dixie Lee was the first wife of Bing Crosby, and was gorgeous, and a talented singer. She made a handful of films in the early to mid '30s, then retired to help raise her family. She is so good here, that you wish she'd made more films. She is a good actress, and injects some real emotion into a part that could have been a stereotyped ""tough dame"" role. She has real heart. And she's some singer, too. She and Morrison are so good together, as the struggling couple, that they really steal the film. George plays her brother, and he even gets to do some dramatic stuff with her. Too bad she never made a film with her husband. And it's a real shame that she died so young, from cancer, at about the age of 40. The director, Elliott Nugent, was the son of J.C. Nugent, who plays Dixie's drunken father in the film. Elliott was a former actor, and had been in Lon Chaney's last film, ""The Unholy Three."" He was a pretty good director, and directed Bing Crosby, Cary Grant, and Bob Hope, among others. I think Hope mentioned that Nugent was one of his favorite directors (see ""My Favorite Brunette,"" with Hope and Nugent). Anyway, it's a sweet film, and is a nice surprise.
