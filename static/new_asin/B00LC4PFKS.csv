8665134,5,B00LC4PFKS,"An entertaining, enlightening, and superbly made documentary.  A worthy sequel to ""Brilliant Moon.""  Have the courage to put your Western beliefs on hold, and open-mindedly enter into the fascinating vistas of Tibetan Buddhism and the very real possibility that karma and reincarnation are scientific facts.  This film acts as a healthy and rewarding remedy to contemporary Western science's stuckness in dogmatism and denial.  It is not, however, necessary to believe in reincarnation to enjoy this film.  It vividly illustrates Buddha's essential and universal message: Think kindly, speak kindly, act kindly.  It shows that equanimity is possible, enlightenment is necessary, and mindfulness and compassion are the shining jewels without which humanity will simply not survive.",1422662400,6,780,5.798245614035087
8665135,4,B00LC4PFKS,"An entertaining look at the ""tulku"" process.  I enjoyed the movie a lot and would recommend it.  A bit heart breaking to see the family seperated but they did understand the reasons.",1422662400,2,182,4.65625
