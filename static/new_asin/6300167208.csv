7804477,4,6300167208,"I thought there was a lot of good info in this funny little video, despite the fact that it predates the internet & Craig's List. Phyllis Diller was wonderful - no matter what she was talking about! I found that most of the content consisted of common sense & things I already knew, but still, I found it useful. Personally, I never would have thought to check to see what our homeowners liability insurance covers. Good advice! Seeing how inadequate in one way or another some of the signs the neighbors post about their sales are I think, ""They should have watched Phyllis' video!"" Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",1405555200,,614,4.590909090909091
7804478,5,6300167208,"Hey, it's Phyllis Diller after all! She can do no wrong in my book. Lots of good information here--it's actually about having a successful garage sale, not a string of one-liners. For 1987(?) it's rather up-to-date. Love the sweater she's wearing in this tape. **grin**",1391817600,,269,5.0
7804479,5,6300167208,"Years ago, my daughter and I needed to have a yard sale and had no idea how to do it.  We checked this videotape out of the local public library for some advice, thinking at the very least it would be good for a laugh. Well, it was. AND it was an incredibly useful help in our endeavors. Details that would never have occurred to me were covered by the inimitable Ms. Diller in this wonderful tape.  Plus, much of the information was emphasized by the humor and silliness inherent in having a renowned comedienne narrate the tape and demonstrate the running of a yard sale.  I really, really want this tape in DVD format because I no longer have VHS.  As an earlier reviewer commented, the information is as pertinent now as it ever was: just good, solid, sensible advice for anyone trying to get rid of their clutter and make a buck in the meantime.  I wish I could give this tape more than a mere five stars.",1330732800,2,910,4.329411764705882
7804480,5,6300167208,"I had the remnants of my parents' estate to dispose of (I was in a tiny, very rural area of the U.S. at that time) so that I could return to my home nearly 2000 miles away.  What I had was a lot of this and that, so to speak, including office supplies and other sundry items.  I was in a quandary as to what I should do about this, as the population of this area was less than 100.  I was in the town video/music store one summer afternoon and happened upon Ms. Diller's video.  My neighbor scoffed at me a little, saying that I would make perhaps $50 in that small rural area.  However, I went ahead and placed a very straightforward, detailed advertisement in two regional newspapers (cost me only about $8 apiece), and I had people coming from over 50 miles away for my 1-1/2 day sale, which I held on Friday and Saturday (not Sunday, as I adhere strictly to my Sabbath day of rest).  The second morning very early, I  put up a ""going out of yard sale"" sign.  By late afternoon everything was sold except four small boxes of whatnot that I was able to simply donate, as Ms. Diller had suggested.  I made nearly $500 in a day and a half with my ""this and that"" sale, and that was even after paying a young neighbor fellow to help me put price stickers on all the stuff, and giving him an item of his choice besides.  The other neighbor that had lived in this area for many, many years was flabberghasted that I could have made that much in such a tiny, rural community.  So I say ... THANKS, Phyllis Diller, for such an unusual, amusing, and extremely helpful thing you have done in making this video!  I had rented the video back then, and now I am going to purchase it for keeps.  (another yard/garage sale is bound to come around again, y'know?)",1045008000,7,1750,4.234939759036145
