8660230,5,B00KN4VLME,This was an unexpected surprise. Did not give much for it but was glad to have bought this one. It is funny and with few twists and you end up wondering what exactly happened when the movie ends...,1448409600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8660231,4,B00KN4VLME,"I am a little conflicted on this movie. I watched previews of this on youtube and some of the behind the scene footage. I really enjoyed the film but it wasn't as good as I was hoping. This movie has a lot of comedy but it also spends a LOT of time leading into the funny parts. I was hoping for a little more time spent on the main characters but they spent a huge amount of time focusing on the side characters. I enjoyed this movie and I don't regret buying it, but I was just hoping for a little more. I would still recommend this movie to who ever is interested.",1432598400,,567,4.0265486725663715
8660232,3,B00KN4VLME,"It was a good movie (liked the twist at the end). My only issue were the subtitles. They took up too much of the screen, in my opinion. Also there seemed to be words missing and there were many spelling errors.",1426982400,2,210,4.146341463414634
8660233,5,B00KN4VLME,"For fans of Kim Jae Joong, you will not be disappointed. He is great in this film.  It's a great comedy to watch.",1418860800,,113,3.9130434782608696
