7919145,4,B00003O9I0,"This video is packed with over 2 hours of live performances and videos by Front Line Assembly. There are also interviews with Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber. An excellent sounding video with lots of songs, but whoever directed the live performances found it necessary to add many annoying effects to the video. At some points you can't see what's going on or the camera is focused on an obsure angle of someone's face and all these cheesy computer effects ""try to enhance"" the live feel. It would have just been better if it was filmed without added effects and with good angles to see what's going on on stage. Also, I hoped there would be some behind the stage and fun footage of the hard wired tour. So, if you're looking for a video packed with songs, here it is!",1015891200,2,762,4.45

This video comes close to showing FLA in their live splendor...catch their next tour to see just how good they get...this video has a couple videos, too,  but the live sets are, well....awesome.",962755200,,259,4.863636363636363
