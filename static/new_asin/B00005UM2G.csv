1665960,5,B00005UM2G,"Ok, once again, this is one of Brain Damage's biggest sellers. This is definetly a movie for those who like the low budget B-flix genre. This is a blood soaked movie from beginning to end. Not only does it have some one the best killing senquences, it also holds the best ""Get Busy"" lines in any movie. And not to mention to people drinking beer while ""getting busy."" If you enjoyed this movie, i also recommend Terror Toons, Death Factory, Carnage, Hollywood Vampyr, and Goth.

1665961,4,B00005UM2G,This movie was creepy and fun!  I got a bruise where my wife was squeezing my arm.  The humor mixed well with the horror and the pretty young things running for their lives was a blast.,1036972800,2,185,4.111111111111111
1665962,1,B00005UM2G,"this movie should be rated s for stupid. it is very low budget, very little plot, and horrible acting and effects. I could almost believe it is made to seem unreal. Dont watch this movie unless you don't have a brain at all. You would have to be that stupid to want to watch this. ...
please if you have any mind at all don't watch this movie.",1018569600,4,343,4.0588235294117645
1665963,4,B00005UM2G,"This is obviously a low budget movie, but the acting is actually pretty good, and the story is entertaining. It is not for the squeamish! Lots of outlandish stuff, like intestines being pulled out of victim's bellies, chain saw action, etc. But the characters are so compelling that it comes across as more Saturday Night Live than Chain Saw Massacre. One really great scene involves all the characters suspensefully standing around waiting for a pager to beep, with quick closeups of faces and different angles, obviously pantomining a scene from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--what a hoot! This is a GREAT audience film.",1013990400,7,624,4.9523809523809526

Phoebe Dollar is great! she has such a unique look you cant help to love her.
This movie looks like they took a home camcorder and made the film.
All the loads of gore violent , bloody and chessy. Its so good!
Joe Castro does the FX, his stuff is great!
Has nudity/soft core, hard core gore, stopmotion anamation.
This is one of the only Brain Damage films I like.",1480982400,,436,4.141176470588236
7954868,4,B00005UM2G,"Released in January, 2002, and written/directed by Jeff Leroy, Hells Highway is a cheap slasher about two couples traveling through Death Valley to the California coast where they pick up a hitchhiker from hell (Phoebe Dollar). Havoc ensues. The infamous Ron Jeremy is featured in a glorified cameo.

Hells Highway proves that an ultra-low budget doesnt mean a movie cant be expertly entertaining. Yes, some of the gory parts are cheesy (while others are pretty impressive) and the miniature sets are obvious, but both are serviceable (and somewhat charming) and keep the story flowing. Viewing the trailer, I thought this was going to be a horror comedy, but its not; its essentially a serious slasher with campy elements  particularly Phoebe as the over-the-top nefarious hitchhiker  and cheesy effects. Jeff Leroy shows his genius in that Hells Highway is adept filmmaking and genuinely entertaining DESPITE the obvious cheapness of it all.

Without Phoebe in the key role, however, it wouldnt be half as effective as it is. Shes not blow-your-mind beautiful or anything, but she has a unique look and theres something alluring about her demeanor, not to mention she has curves in all the right places. Beverly Lynne (Monique), with her conventional hot blond look, cant hold a candle to her (she has an unnecessary softcore sex scene, for anyone who might be offended). Kiren David, as Sarah, is the third main female in the cast and is a convincing actress. Actually, all the main cast members take the material seriously and offer respectable performances.

The score/soundtrack didn't do much for me, unfortunately. This is a movie that needs a few rockin numbers.

The last act features a couple of creative twists in the story and shows that Leroy put some time into the script.

The film has no filler at a mere 70 minutes and looks like it was shot in Southern California.

7954869,2,B00005UM2G,"I enjoy a good low-budget horror movie... but this is a NO budget one! Crude photography, lames dialog and acting that makes a bad high school production of ""King Lear"" look believable! Yet, even with a quick-need-of-a-rewrite script there IS a decent story underneath! True, it does recycle enough genre clichs- ""Blair Witch"", ""Texas Chainsaw"" and ""Hitcher"" are all borrowed from- but in the hand of a more experienced director (Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven) this could be an instant horror classic. And the surprise science fiction- NOT supernatural- ending would also be more effective and memorable.

I suggest a director with more experience and more $$$ remake this epic. Patch up the script, hire some actresses who do more than look hot and scream, and requite Tom Savini for the FX. The only worse than a bad movie is a bad one that could have been good.",1398988800,,858,4.836734693877551
7954870,4,B00005UM2G,"The secret to making a good low-budget horror movie is to revel in the low-budget goodness of what you're doing - and that is exactly what director Jeff Leroy does in Hell's Highway.  Yes, there are some mistakes that could and should have been fixed (for instance, one close-up shot of the driver of a parked car shows the background scenery moving behind him as if he were driving), but there's no artsy-fartsy attempt to make this look like anything more than it is (for one thing, it's shot on film).  The blood and gore is obviously fake - but there's so much of it you can't help but love it.  The acting is over the top - but consistently so - and Leroy came pretty close to hitting a home run with his casting of Phoebe Dollar as Lucinda, the hitchhiker from hell - a superb blend of gothic hotness and gleeful evil.  If I'm ever stabbed to death or hacked up with a chainsaw by some homicidal maniac, this is just the type of girl I would want on the other end of the killing instrument.  The plot is another point in this movie's favor, as its foundation of clichd predictability plays out at a nice pace and features a last-minute twist that actually works out for the good.  The average mainstream viewer probably won't like anything about this movie at all, but Hell's Highway has much to offer fans of low-budget horror.  Indeed, this movie was tailor-made for all of us sick and twisted freaks who love our blood and gore cheap and hilariously made.

According to legend, a young pioneer woman on the brink of starvation called upon and received Satan's aid - now, she walks the road of ""Hell's Highway,"" claiming additional souls for her infernal master.  The two young couples who stop to offer a ride to a hitchhiker know nothing of this story - until Lucinda tells it as she proceeds to assault one of the girls.  Her open threat to kill everyone in the car takes on the air of a supernaturally fated certainty as the terrorized couples continue to encounter her time and time again - even after they're sure they've put an end to her once and for all.  In between these encounters, Lucinda keeps herself busy ambushing and killing other drivers on the road, including Ron Jeremy.

I enjoyed the whole Hell's Highway ride, but it is the ending that impressed me the most.  It's not exactly mind-blowingly original, but it does make for an effective twist that even provides an explanation for what I had originally thought to be a pretty major goof by the director.  Low-budget horror fans should definitely check this movie out.",1306627200,,2548,4.547045951859956
7954871,5,B00005UM2G,this movie has some of the best gore ever I do not know why they gave it an r-rated version it is simply x-rated because guts are being torn apart literally ripped out of the persons body.,1300752000,,188,4.108108108108108
7954872,5,B00005UM2G,"WOW!  Hell's Highway is quite possibly the WORST...  I mean, BEST!  I mean... cheesiest horror flick I've seen in years.  Literally *years!*

For all fans of that Attack of the Killer Tomatoes movie, Hell's Highway is a MUST OWN.

It's about a psychotic woman who roams the desert and claims it's her land, and her desire is to decorate as many crosses as possible alongside the road, so what's a psychotic girl to do?

Yup, you guessed it- she goes crazy and kills every single person that gets in her way.  Hitchhiking just happens to be her way of getting the job done.

As fate would have it, four party animal teenagers (including two boys and, conveniently, two girls) just happen to be on that same desert highway because they want to finally let loose and get away from their Pennsylvania home, so immediately you realize they're on a vacation.

They pick up a hitchhiker one day (who just happens to be the crazy killer waiting for her next victims) and the lives of each teenager completely changes after that.  Now the teens have to run (or drive, rather) for their lives for the majority of the movie.

The amount of blood and violence is *insanely* high, and constantly gruesome.  Forget about the storyline, and please, forget about the acting too.  This film was certainly recorded using low budget equipment, though you have to give credit to whoever the lucky person was capable of getting THIS masterpiece of a brutally horrendous disaster on tape!

A bunch of teens running for their lives and gruesome, bloody deaths.  Does it GET any better?

My only complaint is that it feels a little disrespectful using road crosses as the basis of the storyline.  Then again, there must be a countless amount of graveyard-themed movies out there which is basically the same idea.

Overall, you have to be absolutely crazy to truly be frightened by a film like this- Hell's Highway is strictly for those looking for some incredibly cheap low budget storytelling and violence.  We're talking about the lowest possible horror imaginable, haha.  It's worth watching though!  I loved it!",1294358400,,2091,4.798319327731092
7954873,4,B00005UM2G,"I don't care how drop dead sexy the hitcher may be... Never, never pick up a hitchhiker who's thumbing a ride on a side of the road riddled with cross markings of road fatalities. It can't be anything other than a forewarning of things to come. Of course, it's easily understandable if your common sense is impaired by beer and wacky tobacky. Or if you just want a hot chick in your passenger seat. Either/or, Lucinda (Phoebe Dollar, whose last name possibly represents how much she got paid for this cheapie flick) will give you the ride of your life. Er... make that death. Deliciously gory (the keywords for my three favorite gore scenes: intestines, emasculation, chainsaw. Guess which one refers to Ron Jeremy's demise) thanks to Joe Castro. Pay no mind to the occassional obscure acting and short runtime (just under 70 minutes) and just enjoy the demented trip (with an exceptionally demented climax). And for the heck of it, let me note that this film also contains the most intense, ahem, cell phone to pager transmission scene I've ever encountered. No, really. Why else would I type something like that? 8/10",1291939200,,1119,4.803108808290156

""SETS & EFFECTS"" ..there weren't many sets because the film takes place on a highway. That has me asking why the gas station that Ron Jeremy runs his car into looked like cardboard..? Other than that there where some unique effects. ""EDITING"" ..its hard to explain why some scenes were used but, I can only conclude that the editors were sure that no one would see the movie. ""STORY & SCRIPT"" ..more absurd than you could ever imagine. ""DIRECTION"" ..the director allowed all of the above to take place so enough said!! This is the last time I believe what I read on a dvd case as far as critic's praising a movie. There are about 5 quotes from different reveiwers.. none of them had I ever heard of and, now I know why.",1156550400,2,886,4.375757575757576
