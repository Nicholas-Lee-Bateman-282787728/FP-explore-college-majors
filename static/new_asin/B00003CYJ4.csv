1298918,2,B00003CYJ4,"I saw this movie at an Outfest screening. Luckily my friend got the tickets and I didn't have to waste my money. This movie was another ... lesbian movie disappointment. I must say that I loved this movie at first. I thought that it was excellent... until about the last 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. The ending ruined the entire movie. Why is it that noone seems to be able to make even one lesbian movie where it ends happily?!  If it weren't for the ending I would have gone to see this movie again and bought the DVD when it came out. However, because of the ending I never want to watch this movie again. It enraged me so much that I have been angry about it for the past 3 days! Hopefully now that I've vented I will get over it. If you are looking for a good lesbian movie, skip this one. If you watch the movie right until the end of the brother's wedding and then leave immediately, you will love it. Trust me, the ending ruins what could have been a wonderful movie.",1015545600,13,976,4.136842105263158
1298919,5,B00003CYJ4,"This film had something for everyone: a loving view into a Jewish family, including a beautiful Shabbat ceremony we rarely get to see on-screen; a relationship between two women, each of whom wants to find the right someone who ""gets"" her; and a theme about having the courage to go after the things you want the most.
Scott Cohen is gorgeous and appealing as Josh Meyers, Jessica Stein's difficult boss, ex-boyfriend and friend of her brother. Cohen moves Josh from bitter and judgmental through a significant journey, especially when he sees Jessica summon the courage to be happy and seek her dreams. He shows off his unique ability to bring complexity and heart to otherwise difficult characters.  He sings beautifully, too!
Tovah Feldshuh is brilliant and touching as the Jewish mother with a true understanding of her daughter. This is no caricature here: she has one of the most touching scenes in the entire film. Jackie Hoffman was fun and funny as Jessica's best friend and coworker Joan, who lives vicariously through Jessica and Helen's adventures.
Jennifer Westfeldt (Jessica Stein) and Heather Juergensen (Helen Cooper) wrote, produced and starred in this wonderful, touching, funny view of single life in New York today. In fact, New York itself was a character in this film, providing both opportunities and barriers to the relationships among the characters. The writing and performances are fast and brilliant, and the characters are drawn very well. It's sometimes hard to hear this fast-paced film because the audience is laughing so much. I highly recommend it!",1011139200,24,1582,5.131782945736434

After watching it again I started noticing and paying attention to the details - such as the writing, the flow of the story, and the amazing soundtrack (hats off to whoever chose the music).  I also the acting drew me in, and I realized what a good actress Jennifer Westfeldt is. It is not that common for an actress to convey such a wide range with so many shots of just expressions. I fell in love with the film, although there are some mistakes in some scenes.

1299342,3,B00003CYJ4,It's a cute film and I like that the main character gets to explore her sexuality but ***spoiler alert**** it really bothers me that finding true love with a woman just isn't possible. She needs to get that man in order for it to be a happy ending. It was disappointing to say the least.,1401062400,,287,4.236363636363636

1299346,4,B00003CYJ4,"This is the story of a woman who cannot, despite her best efforts, find a mate. The movie starts with her going out on a lot of bad and funny blind dates.

This inability to find a man causes her to consider an alternative, women. What ensues is our heroin trying to wrap her head around this as it does not seem a natural urge for her.

The acting is good. The female characters are attractive.

This movie is worth a look.",1390176000,,424,4.146341463414634
1299347,3,B00003CYJ4,"A young Jewish woman's overbearing mother and best friend pressure her into a series of blind dates gone wrong, then she meets a lesbian from a singles ad who really seems to click with her personality.  The rest of the film is a series of missteps, pretenses, and misunderstandings.  There is an obvious Woody Allen influence here, beginning with the fact that every scene is either in NYC or it's suburbs.  This actress is like a modern Lucille Ball who earns your sympathy no matter how short sighted her decisions may be.",1388707200,,525,4.684782608695652

1299350,3,B00003CYJ4,It was decent. There are some really cute and funny parts but over all not that impressive. I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out.,1384387200,,136,3.892857142857143
1299351,5,B00003CYJ4,My favorite movie of all time. A bit underrated but it brings me to tears every time I watch it. Characters are brilliant and the story is honest! I'm a lesbian and I know how it feels to not be accepted.,1382572800,,204,4.0
1299392,5,B00003CYJ4,"I have seen this movie on video store shelves and my video recommendation pages for ages. Its cover has always deterred me from renting it -- it just seemed too immature-ish and teenage-esque. And then, when I mustered enough curiosity to delve into what it was about, the subject did not inspire much of anything other than skepticism. Well, after over a decade of dodging it, I am remorsefully admitting how absolutely wrong I was to not have watched it sooner. It's lighthearted, true; but the main subject of the movie is quite heavy, when applied to the real world, so, in my opinion, the two stars, Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt  (who also wrote the script) have picked just the right delivery mode (and mood).

It is a good movie, with a positive message. The fact that it simplifies a complex issue makes it a lot easier to digest.",1380585600,,851,4.666666666666667
1299393,4,B00003CYJ4,"This movie was full of energy and humor, and beautifully acted and edited.  The characters and situations felt real.  I would give it 4.5 stars if there was an option for that.",1377561600,,176,4.46875
1299394,2,B00003CYJ4,The characters seemed forced and unrealistic. There wasn't any real character development. I stopped watching it after 1/2 hour in because it wasn't entertaining at all.,1376784000,,169,5.538461538461538
1299395,5,B00003CYJ4,was searching all over the place for this movie. found it for a great price here and it was brand new. glad that i found it for cheaper than most places that were selling it for $5 used.,1376179200,,186,3.9210526315789473
1299396,5,B00003CYJ4,"This movie is great! I wasn't sure I'd like it when I first turned it on, but after I kept it going I really got into it. It reminds me of Woody Allen's style. It has that kind of humor and insight that is like Woody Allen's films. It's not what I would call a lesbian movie, not at all. It is about seeing oneself in a new and more encompassing way.",1375056000,,350,3.875
1299397,5,B00003CYJ4,"I have watched this movie 3 times now and always walk away with a smile. It is well written, well acted, exploring very normal curiosities and dating challenges",1373846400,,160,4.75
1299398,5,B00003CYJ4,"It's a classic movie that still resonates even after all these years since I saw it the first time.

1299400,5,B00003CYJ4,"It's funny, I've been beating around the bush on watching this movie for months and I finally decide to watch it tonight. Turns out I think I love everything about it! It wasn't the typical ""straight girl turned gay"" movie, it was more like two straight girls turn gay. But I really loved Jessica (although she was looking for the impossible with guys) and what Helen brought out in her. I was pretty sad when the two broke up.

The movie collectively was very funny, sad in some areas, and just overall fantastic to watch, not to mention the great soundtrack to listen to. This is one movie I will definitely watch over again in a heartbeat.",1372636800,,642,4.487179487179487
1299401,4,B00003CYJ4,"This is such a sweet movie! The actresses do a great job portraying the experience of the first time a woman falls in love with another woman, and the inner turmoil one of them experiences regarding her confusion about her sexual orientation.",1371340800,,242,4.785714285714286
1299472,4,B00003CYJ4,"I liked this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago, and I still watch it when I need some good humor. It kindly pokes fun at the subject of same-sex couples and the trials and tribulations of a serious minded career woman who is confused a little about how she should feel about a beautiful gallery manager who puts a favorite quote in the personal ads and peaks the interest of Jessica, who does not want to be alone, but is not sure she wants a partner of the same sex, either. The acting is good, with some familiar faces and some new ones, and the situations are humorous as Jessica weaves her way through the maze of dating someone, female or not, in modern day society. This film is worth a look, for sure.",1370649600,2,725,4.223021582733813

1299474,4,B00003CYJ4,"I miss the movies from around the turn of the century. To see the people in that lifestyle was nostalgic. I was sixteen when this movie came out and I was admittedly way more judgmental and homophobic and way less progressive which I think and hope applies to a lot of people. To revisit that time and see it through such a different lens is a wonderful experience. It takes you to a world that you didn't realize existed. Jennifer Westfeldt writes fantastic characters far less superficial and glamorous than what they put in movies today.

Let yourself love the characters and you won't be disappointed.",1368403200,,605,4.7075471698113205

1299481,4,B00003CYJ4,"I just adored this movie. I don't know, maybe I'd notice problems on a second viewing, but it seemed perfect in every way on the first. Jennifer Westfeldt as Jessica is exactly right as a somewhat conservative young woman who's nervously bi-curious; she sets out to scratch her itch, kicking and screaming all the way. Her family, especially her loving mama (Tovah Feldshuh, a regular guest lawyer on Law & Order who deserves more acting exposure), gives great Jewish attitude. Girlfriend Helen (Heather Juregensen) is gorgeous and thoroughly believable as a bi woman who's as comfortable blending her sexuality as she is blending 3 lipsticks. (Westfeldt and Juregensen wrote the script as well.)

Jessica's jumpy jitters about coming out--a phrase that's never uttered but runs silently through every scene--and her fear of admitting she's involved in a - gasp! - lesbian relationship is entirely believable: within minutes I was reeling back to my first serious relationship with a woman, in which I felt natural and altogether right when we were indoors alone or with other women, but was secretly and silently freaked out the minute we stepped outside. Unlike Jessica's long period of foreplay, which lasted something like 3 months, I acted as if I was rarin' to go, but deep inside I was as terrified as she was. That fear vanished in afterglow-but fear of coming out to old friends, co-workers, and family never went away. I wonder if that means the movie's dated, considering that my ""coming out"" occurred in the mid-70's, and in Jessica Stein we're talking about last year. I don't think so, though: human emotions are eternal, and besides, though attitudes have certainly changed , families and co-workers of those who step over the line, no matter how liberal they want to be, just aren't universally sanguine about it.

Other than that tiny possibility, there's not a false note in this film. It's funny and occasionally poignant, without the saccharine sentimentality usually injected into the topic. Oh and by the way, it's also sexy--very. Not as in X-Rated, more as in real life. Maybe as lesbian movies improve they'll erase the memory of Lianna, a feeble attempt by John Sayles to normalize lesbianism that included the most distasteful portrayals of human sexuality, of any kind or gender, I have ever seen.

I don't want to give away the ending to KJS, so I won't say anymore about the plot. Rent it today, girlfriend, and see it with a girl. Or boy.  Afterwards play Katy Perry's I Kissed a Girl .",1340841600,,2517,4.915294117647059

1.  It's about a straight girl who is a straight girl at the begining of the movie and SPOILER goes back to being one at the end of the film.
2.  There's no romance in this film at all.  No pasion of any kind.  It just felt limp and forced, sort of like the straight girl's romp with with the same sex.  I felt nothing between the two leads.  I kind of think romantic comedies need romance, but that's just me.
3.  The main character is extremely annoying.  Like Phoebe from Friends except pretentious.
4.  The photography sucked.
5.  The music chosen for scenes seemed inappropriate.
6.  When the straight girl comes out to her Jewish family at a big Jewish wedding, the reaction from everyone including a crowd of old farts, seems incredibly unrealistic.  I mean, I don't think every gay film should be an angst fest, but give me a break.
7.  The film ends with the lead getting dumped becuase she won't put out.  Yeah, that was totally worth the running time all right.

Anyways, I said enough.  People, please try to make better LGBT films.  This is just depressing.",1310947200,7,1231,4.45945945945946

She meets a woman who shows her she doesn't know herself !

Certainly, Annie is an original but Diane Keaton can't be copied, even in the capable hands of Jennifer Westfeld. What I enjoyed most was the very original and clever screenplay by Ms. Westfeld and Heather Juergensen. One-liners abound, and situations are interesting. There are generally fine performances from all involved; it's always good to see Tovah Feldshuh bringing a sort of freshness to the often stereotyped Jewish mother. The best thing about the film (and screenplay) was that it was honest and real. Developments could've gone horribly awry in the hands of less capable film-makers.

Without giving too much of the movie away, we see how this relationship finally develops then succumbs to what many couples, both gay and straight ultimately have to face, the loss of compatibility.  The movie goes from highs to lows as these characters are developed into living, breathing people.  I think it helps that the main actors also wrote the script.

1299601,3,B00003CYJ4,"KJS was directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, but written by Heather Juergensen & Jennifer Westfeldt, who star in the film as New Yorkers Jessica Stein & Helen Cooper. Despite the lesbianism there is little T&A- the leads are rather frumpy, but not unattractive, women. The story is every lesbian's fantasy- seducing a clueless straight girl fed up with the male sex. This banal premise goes nowhere. Jessica's hetero-frustration is portrayed in a montage of bad dates that could only occur in films, so right away emotional realism is tossed, & sets the film up for a failure to connect on anything but a superficial level. Helen is a bisexual fed up with men's shallowness & places 1 of those `bi-curious' personal ads. Jessica reads it, is intrigued by a quote from Rilke (she is a copy editor & bookworm), & answers. Even though the ad claims to seek `friendship or more' any person over the age of 20 (especially a copy editor) would know this is adspeak for a lesbian relationship. The 30+ Jessica is clueless, & spends the whole film never even attempting to get with it. That Jessica, as portrayed before meeting Helen, could ever be attracted to such a duplicitous & shallow sort as Helen- even if a man- undercuts the whole point of her dates-from-hell montage. Also, it's supposed to be funny that she approaches her 1st lesbian experience with a slew of `how to' books.

While it may appear to be a film about two women who decide to ""go gay"", it's really about one woman (Jessica Stein) finding herself through ""letting herself go & explore"". The dialogue is great! Excellent statements are made throughout. Some of my favorite moments are...Jessica & Helen are walking the streets of Manhattan as a group of Hari Krishnas are spotted. Jessica says ""Their weird!"". Helen comes back with ""How do you know they're weird, maybe if you believed in what they believed in they wouldn't seem weird"". While I'm not inclined to follow a specific religion or cult like group, it is a good comment on how we perceive others & forget it's a two way street. Another great moment is when Seth Cohen (Josh), Jessica's ex boyfriend & current co-worker, confides in her that ""Whenever you were happy, I was sad & whenever you were sad, I was happy"". ""It's not that I didn't want you to be happy or that I wanted you to be sad, I just wanted to be the one to make you happy"".

Years later, I happened to catch part of it on a pay movie channel early one morning and couldn't turn it off! It is a great romantic comedy with an interesting twist. I bought it the next day. Many movies I own end up sitting in the bookcase after I have seen them once, but not this one. I had to write a review for all the straight folks out there who think this movie isn't for them. It is just a wonderful story about connecting to other people, love, and relationships, parents, etc. You can see the Woody Allen-ness in the film, but that is a postive, not a crappy copycat.

Jessica's mother is perfect her role and Jessica (Westfeldt) is so charismatic in this film you can't take your eyes off of her!

1299647,4,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein"" features no major (or even minor) stars, a low budget (about $1 million), and a taboo topic. But the film, which never would have been made without the perseverance of screenwriters and co-stars Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt, is a refreshing mix of quirky indie spirit and classic romantic-comedy sentiment.

Westfeldt plays Jessica Stein, a neurotic New York copy editor who's fed up with the dating game. If having her overprotective Jewish mother set her up with undesirable suitors wasn't bad enough, she also has to deal with one bad date after another, not to mention working for her ex-boyfriend (a solid Scott Cohen).

The movie gets off to a somewhat rocky star, with the humor coming across as forced and the scenarios boasting a been-there-seen-that feel.

Fortunately, when Jessica decides to answer a personal ad in the ""Women Seeking Women"" section, the film takes off. The first date between Jessica and Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), a downtown hipster with bisexual preferences, is beautifully written and acted. Jessica's gradual transition from feeling awkward to being intrigued is completely believable.

From then on out, with the exception of a few minor lapses, ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is a fresh and funny romantic comedy that explores the ups and downs of the blossoming relationship between Jessica and Helen. Juergensen and Westfeldt, aided by a solid supporting cast, deliver plenty of laughs. Case in point: a highly amusing scene in which Jessica and Helen prod two unknowing, would-be male suitors into telling them why two women together are so sexy.

But ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" isn't all light laughs. With the help of director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, Juergensen and Westfeldt dig into some highly effective dramatic scenes that round out the characters and give the film a little more depth. A nicely shot scene in which the two quarrel about Jessica's unwillingness to tell her family and friends about their lesbian relationship packs a powerful emotional wallop. Ditto a heartfelt exchange between Jessica and her mom late in the film.

While director Herman-Wurmfeld does a fine job of making this low-budget pic look like its budget is much larger, he wisely leaves the focus on the actors and the film's excellent script. Westfeldt, who brings to mind an indie Lisa Kudrow, digs beyond sitcom superficiality to find the longing beneath Jessica's perfectionist leanings. The charismatic Juergensen, tough yet vulnerable, is superb as Helen -- keep your eye on this promising actress.

It's a kick to see two talented young women sticking it to the male-dominated movie scene and creating a top-notch film through their perseverance and talent. Anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy and understands how rarely they come along won't want to miss ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""",1180137600,4,2853,5.257142857142857

1299651,4,B00003CYJ4,"The movie ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is at once a silly comedy, a disturbing look at sexual frustration, misanthropic relations with fellow humans, and promiscuity.

The character of Jessica Stein is a woman too smart, and too neurotic, for her own good.  She feels that she knows herself so well that she has no reason to try anything outside the norm of her everyday routine.  She doesn't really understand how to respond to men who are interested in her and the beginning of the movie paints the majority of men as sniveling, unintelligent, selfish creatures.  I'm sure a large number of men have these undesirable qualities, but I assure you, we are not all this way.  After going through these stereotypical, mildly amusing, but altogether badly written characters that are supposed to represent the dating scene of the time our love lost heroine is embattling her way through loneliness.

Enter Helen.  A woman who is lost in a triangle of sexual intensity, bordering on promiscuous.  A woman who also knows enough about life to understand that selfishness is something that is a natural part of the world, and therefore acceptable.  In a conversation within the movie, and I won't spoil anything too much, Jessica makes a comment about a group of people behaving selfishly because of their pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and happiness and Helen responds with, ""They're just doing their thing.  Some people smoke pot, some people chant.""

The most interesting aspect to the movie is that fact that it was written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, or Jessica Stein and Helen Cooper, respectively.  The acting in the movie is, for the most part, wonderful.  Jennifer Westfeldt's ditzy, air-headed-yet-intelligent personae in the film will get on your nerves every ten or fifteen minutes, but she presents the character in a believable manner.  The one-face-for-every-emotion approach by Heather Juergensen would seem to be something horrible, but, for some strange reason, works.  She uses the same face throughout the movie, but it actually conveys every emotion that she is trying to portray.  Throw in totally believable performances by Scott Cohen as Josh Myers, the jerk ex-boyfriend of Jessica, Jackie Hoffman, as Jessica's loud best-friend and all the other actors/actresses in the film and you have quite a nice little comedy.

  The movie shows that, although it's rare, romantic comedies can be smart, funny and full of heart. KJS explores the risks one has to take to find happiness, how the love of your life might turn out to be someone totally different from what you expected, and whether you can run away from who you truly are.

1299751,2,B00003CYJ4,"I recall a girl I used to know from work who once said to me, in the height of her disgust over dating, that she knew of a lesbian who used to sleep with men occasionally just to remember how bad it was.  The girl thought this a great story.  It is with sentiments like hers in mind that ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was written and made into a motion picture. ""Lesbian chic"" is all the rage today and vengence towards men is an inherent feature of this fad.

Lesbianism is propagandized into being a nuclear option to be used against men, and the relationship that we are privy to in this film is drawn clearly to juxtapose men with women as romantic partners.  We find (surprise!) that men are inferior in comparison.  An important question that never arises is how a ship can sail with two captains or how a song can simultaneously feature two soloists.  ""Viva la diffrence"" is a thing of the past and not something to be tolerated any longer today.

In this film, we find, much to Jessica's surprise, that society as a whole admires women who sleep with women. I think that's quite accurate.  Homosexuality in America is not only accepted; it is celebrated.  When Jessica informs her friend about the  same sex affair she has embarked upon, she hears not condemnation but that her friend is ""impressed"" as she repeats, ""Wow! Wow! Wow!"" The friend is obsessed with the lesbianic mechanics and wants to know what it's like and how the sex is better than it is with men. What else would the conformists say nowadays? Post sexual revolution, experimentation always equates with enlightenment

At a wedding, a crowd gathers around Jessica's lover, Helen, and people can't wait to hear all about their exciting and new Feng Shui lifestyle.

From the outset, we see that an anti-male stance will be taken in all of what will follow.  The camera provides us with a montage of five ""failed"" dates that Jessica has gone on.  The men portrayed in the opening sequence are strawmen, meaning, no such men actually exist or, if they do, they are statistical aberrations of the greater whole. They are the subject of jeering but, inconveniently, they are not representative in the least.

A straight-up, unimaginative view of men is shared with the audience.  The only males depicted sympathetically are non-white, gay, or whimps.  Our alleged sexual inadequacy is an important theme of this film.  A perfect example of this comes when Helen, stares longingly at a matchbox with Jessica's number on it while a lover (one of many) performs oral sex on her.  In another scene, two guys approach them while they're at dinner offering to buy them drinks.  The fellows, despite being 40, are immature jugheads who use words like ""double sexy"" and love lesbians. Outside of pornographic websites, I sincerely doubt that they do.  The real ones do not look or act like Jenna Jameson.

Jessica's neurosis, alongside her repressed heterosexuality, is the enemy of this idyllic relationship, but the movie chooses to begin and end with fantasy.  We see that men can forgive and forget everything, while friendships can remain strong despite past sexual entanglements.  The climax we are given turns out not to be a climax but, instead, is a prelude to another climax that begins and ends in the last three minutes.  Overall, set amidst an abysmal soundtrack, Kissing Jessica Stein is a poor movie from start to finish.",1118966400,9,3392,4.777015437392796
1299792,5,B00003CYJ4,"Kissing Jessica Stein really clicked with my own experiences experimenting with the possibility I might be a lesbian, and so I enjoyed that aspect very much.  This movie is sweet, funny, romantic, and touching.  In particular, the realistic way Jessica's struggles with her own thoughts on love and sex were really well played.  I found myself liking each of the characters for their own unique qualities.  This isn't a ""lesbian movie"" or a ""heterosexuality is the only right way to be"" movie as some propose, but rather a story of a woman trying to understand just what it is she wants out of life and love.  I actually thought it remarkably brave for the writers to go the direction they did with the story--it was honest rather than political.  I highly recommend it.",1118448000,9,770,4.7518796992481205

1299794,4,B00003CYJ4,"Despite its flaws, this is a funny comedy about Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt), a New Yorker, Jewish, single woman who tries and fails at having a lesbian relationship with Helen (Heather Juergensen), a non-Jew, whose life is about art, friends and sexual experimentations.

Obviously, such a combination is bound to create many funny moments, but also truly moving scenes, such as the unexpected tender support her `very Jewish mother' gives, when Jessica has a hard time confessing her lesbian relationship.

The film had great potential, dramatically and comically, but it fell short in both respects. As a drama about a lesbian relationship, it cowardly retreated in the last minute into a conventional heterosexual resolution. As a comedy, this is a shameless, though not bad imitation of Woody Allen, replete with manic pseudo-philosophical musings, Annie Hall and Alvy Singer neuroses, and Diane Keaton's annoying fidgety histrionics.

The DVD version of the movie includes a fun filled commentary by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen. The deleted scenes segment provides much laughter at Jessica's ridiculous male suitors.",1114646400,2,1136,5.554913294797688

Despite Jessica's hitherto heterosexual leanings, she finds herself becoming more involved with Heather and enjoying it. Heather is a very different person from Jessica, open, friendly, outgoing, not uptight, and these qualities appeal to Jessica, it seems. The development of their relationship together is complex, complicated and intelligently portrayed for the most part, while Jessica clearly feels a lot for Heather but at first finds it hard to accept that this is her life, her lifestyle and her relationship. Eventually the two live together and enjoy a relatively happy relationship, although it turns platonic. Despite the fact that the relationship ends, Jessica's life is changed and it was a life affirming relationship for her, but ultimately not what she was looking for. Therein lies the draw and power of this story; two people work hard to give each other a shot, like people should in any kind of relationship, and when they split, they take away a feeling of being richer for the experience rather than bitterness that accompanies the end of many relationships. That, if nothing else, is refreshing.",1110844800,19,1346,5.1506849315068495

1299797,4,B00003CYJ4,"I have to admit I would never have rented this DVD had I not adored Westenfeld in Broadway's WONDERFUL TOWN.  The film was listed in her bio.  Still, I had it for awhile before I got around to watching it, sure it would be too racy for my father...

I ended up watching it with my mother and wondered why I waited so long!  Jessica is a nice Jewish girl working as a copyeditor, who's gone on a series of hilariously bad dates.  (anyone who's been on jdate or match can relate!) She answers an ad by Helen, who has put in a Rilke quote that Jessica had just admired, but is conflicted about it:  in part she was provoked by Josh at a dinner party who told her she was too picky and closed-minded.  Josh is both her boss, and an old college boyfriend.

Jessica and Helen click, but Jessica really is straight and it takes her a while to work up to being fully sexual with Helen.  Nevertheless, she does fall in love, and a scene just before her brother's wedding, in which her mother (delightfully played by Tovah Feldshuh) lets on that she knows, is really touching.  In general the portrayal of the Jewish family from Scarsdale is both funny and loving; no cheap, mean satire here.

But-- this is not really a coming out film, or a film whose treatise is that beneath every straight girl lies a bisexual girl waiting to be released.  It's about love and acceptance both of other people's limits and of your own.  For me, that was part of the movie's strength, but if you're looking for something about girls coming out, you'll probably be happier with ""But I'm a cheerleader.""

There's definitely some discussion of sexuality, but this is a cute comedy that you can watch with anybody.  It's more Woody Allen than x-rated comic book, and maybe more of a real coming-of-age story than anything else.",1106438400,8,1799,4.458715596330276
1299798,4,B00003CYJ4,"Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a nice, young Jewish girl who cannot find herself a man.  Based on the montage of some of the worst (and funniest) first dates in history, a reasonable course of action would be for Jessica to just stop looking.  However, as Woody Allen observed so long ago the heart is a resilient little muscle, so Jessica answers a ""women seeking women"" ad placed by Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), who is bisexual.  But since Helen is straight this would actually give them something in common to talk about, namely men, except that Helen has a lot more success with men, at least in terms of sex.

As you watch ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" it becomes clear that both women are looking for love rather than sex, which is perfect because this film is not about sex, and those who are looking for really hot lesbian sex scenes should just go rent ""Mulholland Drive.""  The question here is not just whether the girl will get the girl, but what they are going to do when that finally happens.  Then there is Josh Myers (Scott Cohen), Jessica's college boy friend, who now speaks of her with the same sort of practiced cynicism he reserves for the rest of the world.  She disregards his jabs, and her disdain eventually inspires him to reconsider Jessica.  However, we do not think as highly of Josh as he does himself, and there is something intrinsically sweet about the relationship between Jessica and Helen.  Besides, the biggest obstacle to their happiness is not Josh, but Jessica herself, which remains both the character's curse and her charm.

Helen is not sure what to expect when Jessica shows up, but someone who is not only straight but who also brings a bunch of manuals and handbooks about lesbians would not have been a high expectation.  Getting physical proves difficult because they are so many places where Jessica does not want to be touched, but there is an undeniable something between the two young women that serves as the basis for a relationship, with or without benefits.  Once Helen becomes aware that Jessica loves her, she suddenly shows a patience that we would not have expected from her.  Yet Helen is even more uncomfortable with the idea of her family and friends knowing about their relationship than she is with actual physical intimacy, and there is no doubt that things will come to a head between them.

Westfeldt and Juergensen first created and played the characters of Jessica and Helen for their stage play ""Lipschtick,"" which certainly explains why they are both so totally comfortable in their roles.  As writers they have created a script that is smart and witty, and one of the biggest surprises is that they do not give the film's best moment to themselves but to Tovah Feldshuh as Judy Stein, Jessica's mother.  I have been a fan of Feldshuh's ever since she played Katharine Hepburn in ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" and Helena Slomova in ""Holocaust.""  Catching her as Danielle Melnick on ""Law and Order"" has always been a treat as well, so it was nice to see she was in this movie.  But I was still blown away by her mother-daughter talk with Jessica, and the exquisitely powerful delivery of a single line.  This is one of those memorable jewels of a moment in a movie where you know you will never forget it and just thinking about it invokes its power.

The DVD of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" has two commentary tracks, the first with director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and the second with co-stars and co-writers Westfeldt and Juergensen.  It will not surprise you that the latter is both more interesting and more insightful.  There are a series of deleted scenes, including some choice outtakes from the bad date montage, and a standard behind the scenes featurette.  ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is not a great romantic comedy, but it is very good, which makes it stand out in that genre, especially with regards to same sex romantic comedies.  Besides, any romance that treats both the heart and the head with equal regard is worth checking out.",1103587200,7,4047,4.781609195402299

1299801,4,B00003CYJ4,"A film by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld
I hope that this movie does not get dismissed or categorized as ""that cute lesbian movie"" because ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is much better than that.  Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) seems to be channeling Woody Allen (in his ""Annie Hall"" days), as a neurotic, Jewish, single woman who is not having much success dating.  Feeling depressed about her dating life, she decides to answer a personal ad...but this is a ""female seeking same"" personal ad and Jessica is not a lesbian.
The woman who placed the ad is Helen Cooper (Heather Jurgensen), who when Jessica tries to get out of the ""date"" is able to talk into staying.  This begins a friendship that quickly moves into an awkward relationship.  Jessica is interested in Helen, but has to move very slowly in becoming physical because of her inhibitions and fears.  ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is a romantic comedy that just happens to be about two women rather than a man and a woman.
""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is a charming, witty, romantic comedy and is a rather cute movie.  The acting is excellent and Jennifer Westfeldt turns in a better Woody Allen performance than Woody has done in more than a decade, and she is cuter and sweeter than Woody.  Jessica's neurosis is toned down, but we do see that her choices have something to do with how her dating life has turned out.  But, it is in the relationship between Jessica and Helen that this movie is really strong.  The film captures their frustrations and the building of their relationship very well that it feels real and not forced.  This is a film about their relationship and because of this (and the performances), it works.",1084492800,6,1669,4.7839721254355405
1299852,5,B00003CYJ4,"I absolutely adored this film - for its real life messiness, for its honest performances, for the eye it turns toward the unexpected nature of life and love.  When mousy, perfectionist copyeditor Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) answers a personal ad for ""women seeking women"" on a whim - she is, and always has been, heterosexual - she meets Helen (Heather Juergenson), a sexy, confident bisexual who works in an art gallery.  The two women click on a deep soul-mate level.  As Jessica begins to find the happiness that has eluded her for so long,  her high spirits are contagious - except to dark but lovable Josh (Scott Cohen), who is perplexed by his own feelings for the newly liberated, but still closeted, Jessica.  Westfeldt and Juergenson, who also co-wrote the screenplay, provide so much depth to their characterizations and situations that the viewer must wrestle with his own expectations. Jessica's awkward and sometimes outrageously funny exploration of what it means to love another woman never takes the easy way out.
The chemistry between Westfeldt and Juergenson is so phenomenal that even the most prudish viewer will want them to find happiness together.  Tovah Feldshuh plays Jessica's mother with energy and deep sensitivity; her powerful performance in one scene provides the pivot upon which the entire film turns.  And how can one not like angst-filled, love-stricken Josh the way Cohen plays him?  Even the supporting actors turn in memorable performances.
""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is an off-beat romantic comedy that has far more hilarity than its more tired and traditional siblings.  The story unfolds with a naturalness that deserves to be admired.  The views of New York from Hoboken, as well as shots of Hoboken itself, provide an excellent backdrop to a story that blends progressive ideas with the old-fashioned, just as Hoboken itself does.

1299854,5,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and contains perhaps the most touching, heartfelt, and believable romances in modern film.  Frustrated single girl Jessica Stein decides to try something different (to put it mildly) and answer a lesbian personal ad in the paper; never did she expect to meet Helen.  The two lead actresses are also the writers and producers of the is fine movie, and they are FANTASTIC.  Westfeldt (Jessica) and Juergensen (Helen) are both radiant and adorable, and share rare, utterly convincing chemistry.  The movie is hilarious, wildly romantic, touching, and poignant, all blended into one bittersweet milkshake.  Jessica and Helen just make the most adorable and gorgeous couple ever.  It's difficult to choose a favourite, since both girls are so beautiful and likeable.  Women and romantic straight men should greatly enjoy this movie.  And special mention must go to Tovah Feldshuh, who played Jessica's mother and was in the most heartwrenching and touching scene in the movie.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you go see it.
That said, I found the ending greatly unappealing.  I felt like cheated by the ending, like a cop-out.  In the DVD commentary, Juergensen and Westfeldt defend their decision for the nature of the ending, and I can see where they're coming from, but personally I don't agree.  I just feel that the tone and events of the ending are incongruous with evidence from the rest of the movie, and that it should not have occurred.  It did not seem to me that this was the ending we were headed towards, and I felt the ending we did get was forced and artificial.  My apologies for the vagueness, but I'm trying not to give too much away.  Other than that, prepare for a rare treat of a movie.",1077321600,6,1778,4.821782178217822

What develops is a sweet and endearing relationship between the two which eventually gives Jessica the courage to shake up other areas of her life and take responsibility for making her own happiness.

The ending is unexpected and at first might piss you off. But if you watch it again and think about who this character is you realize it had to end that way. You can't make someone who is gay straight and you can't make someone who is straight gay. The writers in my opinion had the courage to make a story about a woman who ""tries out"" being a lesbian rather than a story about a woman who, ""presto, chango"", becomes a lesbian. And although you are hoping these likeable characters end up together and make it work you have to accept the ending for what it is because hey, it happens.",1073174400,5,1126,4.3619047619047615

Jessica is a cynical person who never seems to have any fun.  Tired of the dating scene, she answers a woman's personal ad on a whim.  When she goes to a bar to meet the woman she chickens out.
However, the woman, who seems to be unhappy in her own relationships, seems to be immediately attracted to Jessica and tries to introduce herself.  Jessica apoligizes to the woman for wasting her time and tries to unsuccessfully hail a cab.  The woman then spills the contents of her bag causing Jessica to pause and help her.  That pause is all she needs to begin a conversation.
During the conversation, Jessica admits to never doing anything spontaneous, claiming that is not her.  The woman rather rapidly kisses Jessica who seems to enjoy the kiss.  They say goodbye and Jessica leaves it go at that, prepared to go back to her ""normal"" cynical life.  However, her personality seems to change.  She is cheery and dreamy at work and apparently can't get the woman out of her mind.
What follows is a series of dates that in which the cold fish Jessica very slowly lets her guard down until a real relationship develops between her and the woman.
What follows is that once Jessica accepts her relationship with the woman, she finds it very difficult to share the ""news"" of her relationship with her family and other friends.

I won't ruin the ending, but it recieves mixed reviews. Some like it, some hate it. I personally liked it, as it shows the completion of both Helen and Jessica.

1299860,4,B00003CYJ4,"while not perfect, and with an oddly unsatisfactory ending, 'Kissing Jessica Stein' is certainly one of the best rom-coms i've seen in the last few years. Jessica's affected neurotic performance is remeniscent of Ally Mcbeal in the early days when she still had decent one-liners, and the dating hell observations have a definite Sex and the City feel to them, but the film hugely outstrips both tv-series by actually having a heroine who's willing to do something about her fear of 'being alone forever'. Though its largely down to Helen's promptings - and patience - that Jessica even makes it to a first date, the very fact that she answered a same sex ad in the first place showed that she was willing to try and change her life, which eventually leads not only to a meaningful relationship but the inspiration to take up painting (am unashamed plot device but somehow no less meaningful) again ie. a focus in her life other than finding a life partner. Unlike her thirty-something singlet compatriots elsewhere in telly-land (28 year old Jessica being slightly ahead of herself due to extreme pickiness) she identifies the problem, takes a risk, and comes out the end a changed and happier person rather than whining about it for six series and never quite resolving the central issues around their own unhappiness.
It is tempting to say this film is about a bi-curious jewish new yorker and all the labels that that would incur, but mostly it is about a woman taking responsability for her own happiness rather than expecting 'the one' to come and fill the void. In an initial arguement with Helen she says she knows who Jessica Stein is, Jessica Stein not being someone who could even consider a same-sex relationship; by the end of the film she has realised that Jessica Stein is whoever she wants to be, a lesson a lot of thirty-somethings could do with learning.",1063670400,2,1872,4.780864197530864

So Jessica was insecure and had to deal with all the classic coming-out angst (right down to the gloriously modern twist that her friends and family are more OK with her than she is!), so we relate, we identify, we empathize, for hours.
The problem is, after all that, I guess this movie couldn't be made both affirming for us and ""safe"" for mainstream straight folks at the same time.  So at the end, we're the ones who get the rug yanked out.  Surprise!  All that familiar insecurity and confusion happened because she really never was supposed to be with women in the first place!  What a relief that must be to the ""bicurious straight girls""!  Yes, dear, you can experiment, have your fun, and then go right back to the approved normal life society wants you to have.  Never mind about the feelings of the girls you experiment with, either.  (Helen was no innocent victim, but... staying her best friend after that?  Talk about your lesbian fantasies!)
Jessica's a fictional character, so I get to say this: she could have, and should have, been a real bisexual girl.  She was true-to-life, identifiable-with, utterly delightful, and was figuring it out.  It was working.  Sure, she & Helen needed an interesting relationship challenge, but why not give them one they could actually overcome?
Straight people already HAVE feel-good romantic comedies.  Give us back ""Jessica Stein""!
(I actually thought, on first viewing, that the credits were going to roll just after they moved in together, and I'm thinking I might choose to pretend that they do.  It's a pretty feel-good queer-girl movie that way.  Next best thing to a DVD ""bonus alternate ending"", I guess!)",1054512000,13,2440,4.75771971496437
1299938,1,B00003CYJ4,"Well I have to say that this movie was the worst film I've ever seen.
Let's us begin with the stereotypes. The ""sexually frustrated NY business woman,"" ""the flaming gay couple,"" and of course "" the hoe""-who is trisexual..try anything once-- or so I was lead to believe.
Besides the fact that these modern day Commedia characters were bland and lacking charisma- I gave the movie a chance. I actually got into the plot and by the balcony scene, I thought the movie would have a nice ending. Boy, was I wrong.
Jessica ends up with a man, which is exactly what society wants. She tried the "" forbidden fruit"" and once it left her; she decided to go running to the same man who was persuing her while she was ""in love with a woman.""
Maybe this movie could have been called "" leaving jessica stein"" because once Jessica's lover left,the movie's small charm left with it.
 KJS was portrayed as a film about a woman ""discovering"" herself. There was no discovery here. She ""tried"" something and left it the minute it left her. I felt her character was not developed at all, nor were any others. By definition: a comedy is a plot that starts off at a low point and ends on a high one. This started low and ended even lower. Neither romance, nor comedy, nor tragedy here.
This film shouldn't have resembled a POORLY written episode of Sex and the City...",1053820800,11,1344,4.463414634146342
1299939,5,B00003CYJ4,"Jessica Stein is a successful copy editor in New York City. Unfortunately, she hasn?t been so successful in her personal life. She?s a mess of perfectionism and neurosis, and her love life is just plain lousy. The movie opens with a montage of disastrous first dates that collectively bring Jessica to a breaking point. She is desperate to find someone with whom to share her life. When she spots a personal ad quoting her favorite poet, it catches her attention. Only one problem, it?s a woman?and Jessica is straight. Isn?t she? She?s so fed up with men that she?s actually ready to try something a little different, so against her better judgment, she meets with Helen, the art gallery manager who placed the ad.
Much to her surprise, they have a lot in common and, after a few hilarious false starts, they stumble their way into an awkward romance, the first same-sex romance either of them has ever had. Helen is a lot more relaxed about this new state of affairs than Jessica. Jessica is especially scared of telling her friends and her traditional Jewish mother that she is in a lesbian relationship. The issue is forced to a head when she must decide whether or not to bring Helen to her brother?s wedding. Will Jessica be able to maintain her relationship with Helen, and is she even really a lesbian?
Kissing Jessica Stein was based on the off-Broadway play Lipschtick, which was written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, who starred in the original stage production as well as this film adaptation. The script is deliciously funny, with wickedly edgy humor and equally sharp observations about sex and love in the 21st Century, exploring sexuality in a way few movies have had the courage to do. Great writing and wonderful acting make this a witty and realistic movie worth watching. Recommended.",1051574400,,1820,4.836538461538462

The entire film is directed with a compassion for humans whether you are male, female, gay or straight.  There are scenes aplenty of uncomfortable situations and decisions that make you feel for the characters without having to totally relate to their plight.  Written and starring Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, this film proves that they both have a very bright future in filmmaking.

1299992,3,B00003CYJ4,"Let me put this into the form of a question and you dear reader can answer as to the best of your abilities. What romantic comedy have you seen lately that featured these elements: Let's see, filmed in mid-town Manhattan, our protagonists have cute jobs ( usually in an art gallery or perhaps a chic uptown magazine ) wear even cuter clothes, have huge, gorgeous high ceiling apts. ( which would cost a not-so-small fortune in mid-town! ) and have funny, cute friends who always seem to be terribly understanding and devoted...and of course, at times, even convienently wacky? Add a few well chosen standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn or even any other classic vocalist, throw in a couple of scenes filmed in posh, ultra-chic restaurants ( although everyone's always model thin, of course ) and indeed the movie-going masses will beat a path to the front door of your theatre. Now inserting 'all of the above' into any movie isn't necessarily the makings of a bad film. It's simply that while watching "" Kissing.... "" I feel as though I've seen this done more times then even I can count. Whether it be "" When Harry Met Sally "", "" You've Got Mail "" or anything by Woody Allen ( to which this film owes a debt of gratitude ) watching this movie left me with a vague feeling that while entertaining a true sense of deja vu swept over this viewer. While I've always enjoyed these ' Manhattan fairy tales ' it's gotten to the point where any adult viewer can almost make his/her own laundry list as to the stock in trade characters that will appear on the screen next. But before you think me a true cynic let me explain.....
Above all else I will state that watching "" Kissing Jessica Stein "" was not an entirely disagreeable way of killing two hours. The movie does have a certain sense of style and flair that is undeniable. The two leads, Jennifer Westfeld and Heather Juergensen who also happen to have written this off Broadway vignette, have a certain amount of chemistry together. Ms. Juergensen's character Helen especially seemed to have bit more of an edge that was refreshing and I found myself at times wishing the film had concentrated more on her character. As to Jessica herself she, during most of her scenes, came across as far too whiney and indecisive for me to really care about what happened with her. There was the usual stand-bys though....two gay friends who were brought in for comedic relief ( something I've seen countless times ) and a supporting family, in this case Jewish, who seemed comfortable ( and with an acceptance that seemed to come far too easily ) with the idea of their only daughter having entered into an affair with another woman. At times, much of what I was viewing was simply either too far contrived and ultimately far too cozy. Again, entertaining but everything has been polished to a brilliant sheen that effortlessly seemed to skirt any real, serious issues. Plus, and this is what I found truly disingenous....was that other then one of two 'kisses' Jessica and Helen shared they had no other physical contact throughout the film. I realize that many movie-goers may be uncomfortable with the idea of our two female leads having prolonged intimate, physical encounters so it was all simply glossed over. A self-styled "" Will & Grace "" homogenized view of today's Gay society. You know, it's OK being homosexual ( as long as you're shown to be attractive and extremely well dressed of course )....just don't show intimacy or physical carressing to a suburban movie-going public that may feel far too uncomfortable watching anything other then a certain ""gay-lite "" version of what real life is all about for many gay couples/singles in this country. Sadly, it was all terribly predictable.
In the end, while I did enjoy "" Kissing Jessica Stein "" I do feel that a golden opportunity had been lost. Although I did actually purchase the soundtrack as well. As to should you own your very own copy of "" Kissing Jessica Stein "", well, that I'm unable to answer but it is worth a view...if nothing else then for the light hearted Gay fairy tale that is all it purports to be. Overall, it was enjoyable if taken with a grain of salt and a sense of humour. 3.5 stars",1050019200,3,4215,4.643908969210174
1299993,4,B00003CYJ4,"This movie was delightful. It was everything a romatnic comedy should be:fresh,witty,funny,touching,and charming. It was refreshing too, because, it didn't follow the usual formulatic romantic comedy route. I'm not really going to rehash the whole movie with you,I'll just give you the big picture. Jessica Stein is a single young woman living in New York City. She is intelligent,quirky,witty,talented,and not to mention completely neurotic. Feeling like she's stuck in a dead end road, she applies for a ""woman seeking woman"" ad in the newspaper. She's very unsure of her descision to do so, but goes out on a limb, and well, JUST DOES IT. With this ad, she gets Helen. Another succesful young woman, who is all of the above, besides the neurotic part. Helen is definately much more spontaneous, and just wants to try new things in life. That's all I'm going to tell you!!All the performances were really great. The characters were very believable, and likable, and the script was fresh and sweet and funny. It annoys me to death when some garbage is seen by the world and earns a bazillion dollars$$$ at the box office just because Julia Roberts is in it. This is one of the most wonderful romantic comedies I've seen in recent memory, and I urge everyone to see it.

KISSING JESSICA STEIN could have been and should have been a funny story about a single woman's sexual confusion and frustration in an inherently confused and frustrated world, but instead we witness Jennifer Westfeldt giggling and ad libbing well beyond mere annoyance as the insecure Jessica Stein.  Heather Juergenesen, who co-wrote the script with Westfeldt, plays bisexual Helen Cooper with such ambivalence I felt she would have been more comfortable simply staying behind the typewriter.
The story is contrived, the timing between the characters is off, and the ultimate demise of the relationship tacked on as a footnote ending is exasperating.  KISSING JESSICA STEIN had potential, then squandered it via unimaginative, one-dimensional, stereotypical storytelling.  Kind of like kissing a patch of drywall, but who would want to?",1044921600,5,948,5.517241379310345
1299996,5,B00003CYJ4,"Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen have such fascinating on-screen chemistry and I think that is why ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" succeeds so well...After an optimistic but nightmarish dating spree, neurotic New York journalist Jessica Stein happens upon an intriguing personal ad whose only drawback is that it's in the 'women seeking women' section. On a daring whim, she decides to answer it, and, to her surprise, ends up instantly clicking with downtown hipster Helen Cooper. The women proceed to muddle through an earnest courtship in which they are forced to make it up as they go along. ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" has the look and feel of a smart, stylish New York romantic comedy in which the principals are articulate and forthright about their intelligence and sophistication. Yet for an American film it is a groundbreaker in exploring the realm of sexual fluidity, and it does so with wit, wisdom and in a completely entertaining fashion. It has the sheen of a polished Hollywood production but is never glossy or glib as it deals with serious matters with delicacy, good humor and, at times, outright hilarity. It's a low-key comedy with a risque hook -- a seemingly straight woman dabbles in lesbianism -- yet it maintains an old-fashioned faith in literate dialogue, believable behavior and themes that reach beyond the plot points.
Like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon with ""Good Will Hunting,"" co-stars Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt wrote ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" as a way to get themselves better roles than they were (or weren't) being offered. Westfeldt plays the title character, a neurotic Jewish New York newspaper copy editor who manages to stand apart from the various other neurotic Jewish New Yorkers we've seen on film. In slender build and nervous energy, Westfeldt suggests a Lisa Kudrow type, but Jessica's flakiness is rooted in too much -- rather than not enough -- thinking: She's so compulsively rational that she stifles any spontaneous feelings.
Juergensen's Helen Cooper, an outgoing Soho art gallery manager, has no such fears of impulsiveness. Helen, whose features are as full as Jessica's are fine, is casually juggling three male lovers but feels a void. So she takes out a woman-to-woman personal ad that Jessica, in a rare quick-reflex reaction, answers, the selling point being a Rilke quote about opening oneself up to possibilities.
Much of the humor of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" lies in these two likable, odd-couplish women trying to construct a relationship from scratch. While Helen is gung-ho to get to the physical side of things, Jessica is busy studying lesbian-sex pamphlets and studying Helen's method of blending lipsticks.
The movie has its broader gags, too, some that score -- such as Jessica's mom (a wonderful Tovah Feldshuh) and grandmother (a very cute and funny Esther Wurmfeld) conspicuously scoping out the Yom Kippur service crowd for potential Jessica fix-ups -- and some that cover overly familiar ground -- such as the parade of capital-L Loser dates that Jessica must endure before meeting Helen.
But what enables ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" to overcome its awkward moments and ragged patches is its truthfulness. Westfeldt and Juergensen have written and portrayed these characters with a high level of specificity. Helen may be the less fleshed-out of the two, but we get a real sense of her world and a restlessness that is borne less of frustration than an eagerness to experience more.
The lesbian content may titillate some and scare off others -- though the movie shows nothing more graphic than kissing -- but that's not really what ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is about. It's about the need to take a daring leap to discover who you truly are. Various characters see their risk-taking open up new possibilities. The same might be said of Westfeldt and Juergensen, who should reap the rewards of having thrown their considerable energies into the perilous indie film world and emerged with an engaging, original work. When life doesn't hand you a dream date, sometimes you've got to create your own.",1044230400,7,4076,5.1308270676691725

1299999,4,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is getting blasted here by viewers who were expecting a lesbian romance film, which it is ... and is not. Though it features a lesbian romance between the cute Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, it's not really about that. The film, actually, is about Jessica Stein coming to terms with who she is, what she tolerates and how she can learn to open up to new things, whether they be a bisexual romance or, on a smaller scale, e-mail use.
Jessica Stein is a pretty and nice, if snobbish and paranoid, Jewish girl. She works as an editor, has a hang-up about people with bad grammar and has so many pet peeves that she shuts down any potential date before they have a chance to prove themselves. This is what kept her from a relationship with her editor, played by ""Gilmore Girls"" actor Scott Cohen, and is what keeps her from meeting anyone new. But she doesn't see what she's doing wrong.
One day, she reads a personal ad from an intelligent prospect who seems just about perfect, even quoting a line from Jessica's favorite philosopher. One thing is wrong, though, for this prospect is a woman. But Jessica, frustrated with her lot, goes out with the girl anyway and ends up, more or less, falling for her. Though intellectually attracted and curious about her new ""friend,"" Jessica, saddled with those pet peeves and an overbearing Jewish mother, can't quite fake her way through a sexual relationship, wherein lies the problem. And just how gay does Jessica have to be? Can she be gay enough or open enough to make her new relationship work?
Those expecting a gay movie will be, on the whole, disappointed. Those open to the possibility that the movie's not about romance, but about opening yourself up to chance, will appreciate it more.
In the title role, Jennifer Westfeldt does an interesting thing with her character that doesn't quite work. She essentially channels the onscreen personality and line delivery of Diane Keaton, so much so that a friend of mine argued that she seemed possessed by the actress. The movie, because of that, doesn't reach its full potential, seeming mostly like ""Annie Hall Meets a Girl.""

Cute and funny if you are willing to overlook the whole thing about being born gay or not being born gay.  After all say so many on both sides -  ""How do you know if you haven't tried?""

1300001,1,B00003CYJ4,"How come the mainstream media loves this film? I thought it was a sad and sorry excuse for making a conventional heterosexual love-story without being 'politically incorrect'. It is NOT a film about lesbians and it is definitely NOT a film about same-sex love. Yet the media and many others persist in defining 'same-sex FRIENDSHIP' as lesbian - as if lesbian lovers are just friends and don't desire each other sexually. Now, in the end, the bisexual girl dumps the tedious straight chick for not wanting to have sex with her and that is good, but the main plot is not about that - it's about the straight girl 'finding her way back' from confused sexuality to the love of her ex-ego boyfriend. It is also about the anxieties about coming-out (as if we needed some straight women telling us about that...) and this is filmed in the least credible way: the daugther does not even have to say anything because her conservative, androcentric, Jewish mother has already guessed that she's 'gay'. As if that is likely to happen in real life? You can write 'I'm a lesbian' on your fore-head and most mothers are still able to disregard it...
There is nothing radical about this film - it is merely reproducing heteronormative assumptions about lesbians (Jessica Stein is even afraid of having coffe with a 'real lesbian' and doesn't feel comfortable until her date confesses that she has not dated women before either...and they don't have sex until they've asked two straight guys what they think about chicks having sex with each other - as if the 'male gaze' or 'male permission' were the only ways to get them going.).

1300063,4,B00003CYJ4,"Some people just don't ""get it"". I really don't understand why. People see ""Chasing Amy"" and say.. ""well she really wasn't GAY then"". Characters in the movie say something along the lines of ""Well.. you're born GAY."" My question is, do you HAVE to be? Is this wrong to decide to come to it on your own terms? Someone quoted on the bottom says that the in the film Jessica only wants her boyfriend to notice her again.. which she accomplishes. Well he DOES notice her again. but, I don't think she ever fell for him again EITHER. Is the viewer saying Jessica as a female (gay,bi or hetero) still can't have a MALE friend? If this is what they are saying then that frightens me.. and does that mean that gay persons hate all others of the opposite gender? The ending isn't a pat Hollywood ending.. but I don't really classify this as the typical ""Indie"" fare, but.. the women, neither Jessica nor Helen, were GAY.
Onto the film. Helen a rather free spirit, and lets just face the fact, promiscuous woman on a whim places a personal ad seeking a woman.. Enter Jessica of the title who answers, hesitantly, and the two hit it off. Neither really have a feel for BEING gay... but I think neither have really found what they wanted where they were. This film tracks the slow and neurotic Jessica on her journey to try and accept who she might be.
I will not say Jessica is gay... or straight, that's a value judgment without really knowing someone. Even in the film, you really don't know for sure. Jessica is a guarded, secretive and neurotic but sweet woman. While Helen being kind.. is more a physical agressive type. The film resolves with no answers.. there is no ""we see the man and woman ride off into the sunset"". This is more akin to ""Chasing Amy"" but, on a lighter note as opposed to the heavy and rather dramatic ending with a Dave Pirner composition.. It's still very much left open.. sure, you can conclude Jessica ends back up with her boyfriend.. You may think she ends up with the cute girl with glasses.. But the film offers no real answer. It says nothing against gays, or for. Film many seem to want to see as propaganda. And they want it to present a certain ""viewpoint"". And those films that don't are ""explotive, vile, or garbage"".
People are all different.. and it's nice to see something that.. someone doesn't quite know where they are.. and maybe she is straight, maybe she isn't. I don't know, but I enjoyed seeing her make the connections. It's a character film and surprisingly good performances from the producer and writer of the film, and a turn from Scott Cohen as the frustrated editor. Surprising, perhaps to me, for only noticing before Cohen in a game for the PC called ""Ripper"" and several tv commercials. Over all though a uniform well acted, and written film.. Sure, at times it may have been too cute.. and times, it may have been too pat.. but at the end of the movie, if a romantic film works.. then it's done its job, this is one of the FEW films in the genre of the last few years that does.. and straight, bi, or gay.. It's still a good watch for anyone... and everyone. While it may not pull your particular ""party line"", that's ok too.. It's only a movie, its not a speech, or a statement. It doesn't speak for or to everyone.. and its not supposed to.. It shows two people, maybe not the poster girls for any gay organization but it was sweet.. and heartfelt.

1300064,4,B00003CYJ4,"This is a movie about dynamics.  It's a movie about a slightly (very?) neurotic girl who tries to be a lesbian, and isn't.  At least one other review called it an insult to the lesbian community.  I don't see how this is, since it's not a movie about the lesbian community.
The gay guy in the movie got offended by it - by it's own admission it's not ""real"" homosexuality -- moreover, one of the main characters <i>realizes she isn't a lesbian</i>.
This is a cute romantic movie which treats the subject manner with a fairly good degree of taste, and explores a very interesting human dynamic - not a lesbian dynamic, just one woman.  I liked it.  I thought it was cute.  It wasn't a guy fantasy girl-on-girl thing.  It was a movie about the building (and disintegration) of relationships, and one in particular.
The writing in the movie was wonderfully personal, detailed, and true to charatcter, and the acting was superb.

The clips of Jessica's bad dates (the guy who goes to the gym to get his dorfmans pumping, the accountant who charges her extra for the salad they split because she ate more arugula) alone justifies owning this DVD.  Jessica is a witty, literate, bookworm who just can't seem to find her match in NYC, even with the best efforts of her meddling mother and pregnant colleague.  When a coworker reads a personal ad aloud that opens with a quote by Rilke, Jessica's interest is piqued -- even after learning that the ad was written by a woman seeking another woman.  Jessica hesitates to actually meet the ad's writer, and when she does meet, she claims she can stay for just a minute, -- but she's charmed by the writer's use of the word ""marinate,"" and thus the friendship/romance begins.  The movie shows the blurry lines between friendship and more than friendship, encourages to explore who we are, and teaches us that in the end, we can't pretend to be something we're not.  There are lots of extra cut scenes, along with commentary by the writer/producer (who also happen to play the lead roles)on the DVD",1041984000,5,1207,4.669811320754717
1300066,4,B00003CYJ4,"This movie, to my mild surprise, had a lot going for it the second time around. I saw it in the theater, originally, and took it as a pleasant little movie about learning to take risks (with an almost incidental twist about sexual preference). Seeing it again, though, I was struck that it's not as simple as the sitcom of your choosing. It's got some ideas in its head -- that Rilke quote about inertia and shyness is one -- and there are several moments when it doesn't give you exactly what you're wanting, which is always a shock of fresh air in a pop movie.
Let's see... what's a good example to use of all that? How about the funny little montage of bad dates near the beginning? We're meant to laugh at those, sure -- and hey, a copy editor on a date with a man who describes himself as ""self-defecating,"" that's funny. But Josh has a point at the party a bit later; he lays into Jessica for her quick judgments about all those men, and suddenly their faults don't sound so earthshaking, do they? So, how real were those bad dates? Were those just Jessica's impressions of them? We don't really know. The movie gave us the laughs, but then it asked a question. I like that.
Another thing that struck me, both times, was the wonderful casting and the nice writing, even for the minor roles. This isn't like a prefab modern romantic comedy, where at least one of the main characters always has a sort of Greek chorus of zany sidekick friends who feel like assembled parts from the bin of character actors Hollywood keeps out back. Tovah Feldshuh as Jessica's mother is fantastic, in a part that had to be pretty slight on paper. Jessica's pregnant friend at work and Helen's gay friends feel like real individuals, not like the one-episode romantic interests on Friends, you know? The smallest roles are still memorable -- Helen's bike messenger man tries on a cowboy hat, and her jealous lover at the studio glares, and the dissheveled man comes up from the covers with a completely wonderful expression on his face... they're all distinctive and well-played.
That's leaving alone the three main roles. Jessica and Helen and Josh are all dead-on. This is the sort of movie that gives its characters good arguments to make, not just lines that represent who they're supposed to be in the story, you know? Sure, Jessica has a modest dash of stock writing: she's Jewish, her mother's trying to fix her up, and so on. But I believed in her, and I liked her, and the questions the movie was asking about her life held my interest -- more than once now.
And that's what this one comes down to, I think. If you ""buy"" the characters, as individuals, then you're going to appreciate the movie. There are going to be some people who can't do that. One of the other reviews here decided the movie wasn't a good example of how lesbianism happens, I guess, and gave it one star. (It's unclear whether that person saw the scene in which the gay couple argues over that exact point. Another question, to the credit of the movie.) These are individuals, not representatives of their races or classes or anything else. They aren't making up the rules for all Jewish people, or all lesbians -- the movie's about how, having been kissed, Jessica has some choices to make, and decides, tentatively, to make up her own rules with Helen.
And if you don't try to make the decisions for her, you'll probably enjoy watching.",1041984000,8,3405,4.556280587275693
1300067,5,B00003CYJ4,"KISSING JESSICA STEIN (2002)
Kissing Jessica Stein is a low budget romantic comedy about a neurotic New York journalist who, after a series of bad dates, decides to answer a personal ad that catches her eye, the only problem is that it's in the ""women seeking women"" section----and she's straight.
Thankfully ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was able to live up to its catchy concept, resulting in one of the best and most original romantic comedies I've seen in quite some time. It's sort of like a same sex version of ""When Harry Met Sally,"" in fact you could even call it ""When Sally Met Sally."" Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, who star as Jessica and Helen, also wrote the wonderfully clever script. I must say these two real life best friends have a lot of talent, not only do they give two very natural and charming performances, but they also wrote this gem of a film. The character of Jessica could have been semi-annoying if she were played by anyone else, but Westfeldt gives Jessica the right amount of charm and cuteness to make us love her. Westfeldt, who is like a cross between Jennifer Aniston and Helent Hunt, and Juergensen, who is like a younger Janeane Garofalo, are definitely quite a find. They were able to take a controversial topic and create a light and fun film that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. Now that's not to say that it doesn't have its serious moments, one particular scene involving Jessica and her mother, Judy (Tovah Feldshuh), was quite touching. I loved how the simple line ""I think she's a very nice girl"" was able to make such an unbelievably huge impact.
I think anyone, male/female or gay/straight, will be able to relate to ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" in one way or another. It's not easy finding someone you can ""click"" with and it can seem hopeless sometimes, like you will never find ""the one."" So when you actually do find someone you ""click"" with, it's a great feeling. In ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" Jessica is shocked when her date with Helen ends up being one of the best dates she's ever been on. She finds herself confused because she has finally found someone she ""clicks"" with, except it's not a man, and she's not a lesbian. Jessica, not sure what to do, pursues a relationship with Helen. This leads to a number of funny moments with Jessica trying to be turned on by Helen and trying to find herself by experimenting, at one point she even breaks out the how-to books on lesbianism.
Another thing I really enjoyed about ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" was the music. I usually don't like Jazz but the songs went perfect with the film, especially the very fun and catchy ""When The Special Girlfriend"" by Ute Lemper.
Overall, I really appreciated the originality of this film. I hope the Academy remembers it come Oscar time because it deserves to at least be nominated, especially for ""Best Original Screenplay,"" which it deserves to win. I also must say for such a small budget the film looked great, director Charles Herman-Wurmfeld did a top notch job.  It had the feel of a Woody Allen movie, although it was better than any Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. It delivered everything it promised and more. I didn't even mind the ending, which a lot of people seem to have a problem with. At first I was disappointed when it started going in that direction because there's a spot where it could have ended perfectly (you'll see what I mean when you see it), but in the end I thought they pulled it off really well. It ended realistically and on a happy note. I can see why some people wouldn't like the ending, but for me it wasn't enough to keep ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" from being a classic romantic comedy.

1300070,5,B00003CYJ4,"This movie is terrific in every way.  For starters it should not be advertised as a Gay & Lesbian film.  It is a brilliant romantic comeny.  Jessica Westfelt and Heather Jurgensten steal the show in every scene.  Their performances are terrific and the supporting cast do a great job.  The two girls wrote the movie themselves and it is perfect.  The key behind a good movie is a good story and they have done it.  The humour is halerious and it is an all around good and fun film.  You can see the fun they had making this movie because it is reflected on the screen.
This is a good and funny film in every way.  Because it didn't get as much exposure through advertising as other films because of the budget lots of people will miss out on the experience.  It just goes to show, you don't need to have a huge budget or media attention (eg. StarWars or Spiderman) to have a great movie",1037750400,2,886,4.283132530120482
1300071,4,B00003CYJ4,"This is a nice, light little film with a decent script, charming actors and actresses, and a New York Flavor thicker than the pastrami sandwiches at the Carnegie Deli. And oy, gevalt, it is so deliciously Jewish. The premise of the film is that a somewhat conservative (""vanilla"", not ""political"") young professional woman has wiped out on bad dates with various New York men and decides to answer to a personal ad placed by a woman who shows (on advice of her gay friends) a literary bent.
The friendship and romance are developed very believably, as are the reactions of friends and loved ones for both parties. This film does not talk down to the viewer, nor does it pander. It is a sweet, simple story. Although many screenwriting hacks say that a good story is driven by conflict and distopia, this film succeeds in telling a story where *everyone* is a decent person. How refreshing!
Having said that, let's describe the DVD itself. The quality is good, the colors have not been tweaked to death. The features are what you expect - you can get subtitles, commentary, and deleted scenes. There's a lot of extra footage about ""Grandma Esther"", who is the granny of one of the people involved in the film. Its a nice little look into the fantasy I certainly have had - ""What if someone threw me in front of a camera in a movie and shouted, 'ACTION!'"" (Tovah Feldsuh gently instructs Grandma Esther - ""Honey, wait 'till they say ""action"" and THEN you can talk."")
The chatty commentary is interesting. One is the director and cameraman and they go on about sweeps, pans, angles, and other technical stuff. The other is the two women who wrote and starred in it. They go more into  the story. Both commentaries agree that the film had a lot of kind benefactors who had the coolest apartments in New York City.
I think commentary is the best thing about DVDs. I love hearing the people talking about all the folks who don't get a lot of recognition for their work in film - these folks acknowledged contributions from everyone from the catering truck to the production assistants who had to run out and buy juice for a prop to a neighborhood cat who just happened to sit itself down right in the middle of a fruit stand to grab some screentime.",1037577600,4,2243,4.579601990049751
1300132,4,B00003CYJ4,"A refreshing twist on the romantic comedy, ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" trades on the promise of exploring the taboo subject of straight girls having lesbian relationships.  But the fact that it is less about homosexuality and more about finding the right mate - regardless of gender - ensures it has wider appeal.  Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen are endearing as the would-be lovers, Jessica and Helen, and they're backed up by a wonderful supporting cast - especially Jackie Hoffman as co-worker Joan, and Tovah Feldshuh as Mrs Stein.  But it's Helen's gay friends Martin and Sebastian who ultimately steal the show.  The script mostly steers clear of clich and mawkishness, but there is a yuppies-recovering-their-artistic-selves subtext that sometimes screams a little too loud.  However, the resolution of the love story is realistic and, for that reason, the minor faults are easily forgiven.",1036886400,3,904,5.382978723404255
1300133,4,B00003CYJ4,"Writers Heather Juergensen and Jennifer Westfeldt, taking their off-Broadway creation to the big silver screen, are the driving force behind this fun film. Their characters are real and realized, deep and complex, insightful and real. Kudos to these strong women for bringing to equally strong women to the screen.
The movie is brave in that it doesn't rely on tired cliches to advance the plot. Even the ending avoids a traditional Hollywood happy ending, by giving us a pleasing, eye-opening complex one.
It's a movie about relationships, being brave enough to take a risk, and feeling comfortable within yourself to love someone else. The fact that its two women is immaterial, the distinction doesn't matter. It's about living and loving in today's modern, complex world, and who cannot relate to that?",1035590400,,806,5.1603053435114505
1300134,3,B00003CYJ4,"KISSING JESSICA STEIN is one of those films to which my reaction might be best expressed as a shrug and the comment, ""Well, the popcorn was tasty.""
Jennifer Westfeldt plays Jessica, a nice, attractive, inherently heterosexual Jewish girl whose luck finding the right fella is positively dismal, perhaps because of impossibly high standards. Desperation causes her to answer a personal ad in the paper placed by Helen (Heather Juergensen), the bisexual, adventurous and passionate manager of an art gallery. The subsequent closet relationship progresses from unsure trepidation (on Jessica's part) to a full-scale lesbian affair that generates a ""guess who's coming to dinner"" tension when Jessica brings Helen, a shikse, to meet her family gathered together for her brother's wedding. Of course, Mom (Tovah Feldshuh) has always wanted her daughter to wed a nice (and successful) Jewish boy, and hasn't been shy about matchmaking. Oy!
This isn't a bad film by any means. All of the principle characters are attractive and sympathetic.  However, except for one poignant heart-to-heart between Jessica and her mother, the emotional depths and pitfalls of a relationship with a same-sex lover are barely plumbed. This is not a deep film in any sense, and Jessica dances across what could be a potential minefield relatively unscathed. It's as if the film's producers didn't know whether to make it a comedy or drama, and by the final scene I wasn't sure why they'd bothered. Perhaps they thought it would raise more eyebrows in Traditional America. And maybe it did. However, here in multi-lifestyle Southern California, the KISSING JESSICA STEIN movie experience was similar to watching the waves roll onto the beach or the palms sway in the ocean breeze -  not without its attractions, but certainly not noteworthy.",1034467200,6,1813,5.248275862068965

Only problem - it's in the ""women seeking women"" section.  Acting out of the box, she decides to answer the ad and meets funky Helen Cooper for drinks.  To her surprise, they click.  The scenes that lead up to their first kiss are great and the relationship between the two women is real - this is a modern romantic comedy that did not end the way I thought it would (which was a nice surprise).  Don't dismiss it because of the subject matter - it's not what you think - just go see it and enjoy watching an entertaining movie.",1033948800,8,928,4.293103448275862
1300136,5,B00003CYJ4,"Jennifer, with her Lisa Kudrow""ish"" beauty, was great in this movie!  My suite mates and I ( a mixture of lesbians and hetero's)  had a great time with this picture.  Jessica was so cute with her quirks and on going lies!  Helen was fantastic, because these were probably some of the main things that made her fall for Jessica.  (Who COULDN'T fall for Jessica!) This movie was hilarious from the first take!  Watching Jessica and Helen meld their new found discoveries about themselves into their skin was really entertaining.
EVERYONE was rooting for Jessica and Helen to hook up.  The writing hit everyone on every level, because it was not a lesbian or straight thing.  It was about us being women trying to find that person who stimulates us mentally and physically.  We all agreed that the question to be answered was, ""Is sex the the innermost part of a true loving relationship; or is it a small component of a huge package?  What are we willing to sacrifice so we can have the person who ""get's"" us? ""
Looking at the ending in a non-bias way, it was good because this was not the type of relationship Helen was looking for.  In hind sight the two women would be much better as friends.
Now being TOTALLY biased, I wanted the women to stay together because, Jessica is much to beautiful to be straight!  This could have been a schmaltzy ""Girl finds her princess and lives happily ever after in rainbow heaven ending"" I could really dig!
This movie has true brain power!  This is an intellectual comedy that is scarce in cinema today.  It displayed 2 women being sexy, smart, funny AND beautiful.  It is a definate must see!",1033862400,,1630,4.572413793103448

Most of the characters in the film about a New York writer looking for Mr. Right, and finds Mrs. Partly-Right instead, drove me crazy with their Woody Allen-esque attempts to be intellectually funny.  The tedious whining and self-deprecation that only worked for Woody 20 plus years ago should be left solely to Mr Allen so that when I am in the mood for this genre, I can rent 'Annie Hall' or 'Manhattan' with full knowledge that my teeth will be set on edge and that I will think of New York of the 70s, shake my head and laugh.
Not so with this film.  ""Sex and the City's"" portrayal of New York singles and their venue while sometimes cloyingly simplistic and blatantly outrageous leaves this little story choking on its dust and accomplishes this in just a half hour. What is so titillating about alternate lifestyles, anyway?  I had absolutely no empathy at all for 30 something Jessica who seems to have no clue as to what or whom floats her boat but is condescending enough to mentally correct anyone who doesn't share her penchant for literary quotes and word usage.

1300138,5,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is an instant classic.  Like Woody Allen's ""Manhattan,"" it documents the lives of a cluster of friends and family in present-day New York.  Only the present day is that of 2000, not 1979, and things have changed, although not as much as one might think.
Nearly all of the performances are spot-on.  Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen show their impressive stage-honed chops in several long scenes which require great skill.  Scott Cohen is impressive as Josh, the character who unexpectedly undergoes the most profound change in the film.  Jackie Hoffman, as Joan, is equally impressive and funny, and Tovah Feldsuh is simply perfect as Judy, Jessica Stein's mother.
The principal reason these superb actors deliver great performances is the film's intellectual core, which far surpasses that of most dreck released these days.  There are actually real ideas in there -- about the good life, loneliness versus independence, happiness versus our concern for others' estimation -- Rilke is featured for God's sake!  This is exciting stuff.  And it's all leavened with great humor, which underscores the actors' proficiency -- comedy is truly more diffcult than drama.
The film looks good, too.  While Lawrence Sher's cinematography is perhaps not quite at Gordon Willis' level (admittedly, Sher labors under the disadvantage of having to work in color), the film successfully captures the feel of New York.  A big part of this is accuracy: I noted only one miscue in the film's use of locations.  (Can you spot it? Hint: that's not below 14th Street.)
""KJS"" also makes clever use of music.  Some might think this unimportant, but when a comedy gets several meaningful laughs from the way it deploys songs, it shows that the production is firing on all cylinders.",1033516800,3,1791,5.137931034482759

Indeed, as hinted in the movie, it might be considered politically incorrect by some gay activists.  It can hardly be said to represent much of anything in the spectrum of lesbian lifestyles.  But it is a novel, refreshing, and finally a little sad, but hopeful, romantic comedy, that just happens to involve two initially straight, and very good looking, women.  The ""R"" rating has got to be simply for the fact of the two women kissing each other:  The sex is literally no more explicit than that.  ""Mulholland Drive"" is the place to go for a steamier sex scene in a mainstream movie.  ""Jessica Stein"" is about love, friendship, and personal growth in a very clever and light but memorable way.",1033084800,,812,4.7913669064748206

The results:  Jessica expands her horizons and is forced to a higher degree of self-awareness, as are the people closest to her.
Leaving aside any ""political"" statements that all gay-themed movies seem pigeon-holed toward making, ""Stein"" is a funny, yet touching, film.  Watching Jessica's failed dates, followed by her attempts to keep her newfound lesbian relationship private, allows us the opportunity to peek into this girl's neuroses, which, let's face it, are not that uncommon.
But the beauty of this movie is how empathetic Jessica and Helen become to the viewer.  I found myself truly admiring these women, and rooting for the success of their relationship, despite all odds.  I honestly felt Jessica's pain on the porch of her house during that scene with her mother.  The characters truly come to life on screen, almost as much as if I knew them and had brunch with them last week.
Having looked over the reviews on here -- which appear split between ""it's a cop-out ending"" and ""it's a great ending"" -- I've simply come to the conclusion that you can't please all of the people all of the time.  Better that the movie gave us an ending, as opposed to some other movies I've seen (""Coming Out"" comes to mind) where what happens next is completely up in the air.

Here are 5 reasons to see 'Kissing Jessica Stein':
1. Not only are Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen superb actresses, they are persistent and talented entrepreneurs as well. They sheparded this movie through development hell and produced a brilliant movie for $980,000. To date the movie has grossed over $6 million. Let's hear it for perseverance and vision. Go out and support these two businesswoman.
2. The talent in the movie. It runs very deep - beyond the obvious talents of the two co-stars, don't forget about Tovah Feldshuh, Scott Cohen and (especially) Jackie Hoffman (hilarious as Jessica's cubicle-mate).
3. The New York City setting. Studios asked Jennifer and Heather to consider moving the filiming to Toronto and other 'cheap' locales. The girls insisted on New York. See the movie and you'll agree - this could not have been filmed anywhere but NYC. Go see the movie and get a slice of what makes New York special.
4. The stars themselves. The studios pushed to get 'name' actresses like Lisa Kudrow and Courtney Cox for the roles. The girls insisted that only they would play the parts, or the movie wouldn't get done. You'll feel rewarded by their stubborn streak when you see the film.
5. The script - these girls know comedy. Check out the ""Dates From Hell"" scene. You'll bust a gut. Can't wait for the DVD because I've read interviews in which Juergensen says that a lot of hilarious ""Dates From Hell"" material was left on the cutting room floor.",1020988800,15,1657,4.942652329749104

1300217,5,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein"" is a romantic comedy/drama about a single woman, Jessica Stein, who I like to call the female Woody Allen.  She is neurotic, funny, quirky, intelligent, and also very likable.  Although she is much more attractive than Woody.
She becomes very downhearted about dating and decides to answer a personal ad in the  ""women seeking women"" section because she likes the quote in the ad.
The woman who places the ad is Helen. She is funny, smart, but certainly not neurotic like Jess.  She is looking for something different in her life that she hasn't tried before.
Eventually they meet....And Jessica goes from downhearted to down right happy.  I am not one to totally rehash an entire movie and it's plot in my reviews. I recommend this movie because it is refreshingly funny, really funny, and just an all around entertaining time out at the cinema. Also, the acting by all the actors is great, especially the actress who plays Jessica's mother, Tovah Feldshuh.  She plays the role of the overbearing mom to perfection.  The script was written by the two actresses that played Jess and Helen, and it is so amazingly well written and produced.

1300218,4,B00003CYJ4,"I saw the previews of ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" and thought it looked like a funny movie about a Jewish American Princess's flirtation with the idea of embarking on a lesbian relationship. The trailers said Jessica would have to choose between ""a man who's almost impossible, and the woman who's almost perfect."" I thought I had figured out the movie darn near entirely from the coming attractions, and that I would be in command at the movie.
But I was wrong. The movie took some turns I didn't really expect. Frankly, I was honestly shocked that Jessica and Helen truly do become lovers--I thought it was going to remain that Jessica wouldn't be able to ""go all the way"", a parody of '50s cheerleaders and their Ken doll boyfriends. I wasn't prepared for the actual realization of their lesbian affair. I wasn't in control at all--I didn't know where it was going to go, and what was going to happen. But despite the unease that did cause in me, I thought this was a really funny movie, but yet not one without poignance.
I was genuinely moved by the scene between Jessica and her mom, played by Tovah Feldshuh, as the mother demonstrates a better knowledge of her daughter than Jessica suspected. She provides such an absolution to her daughter that I felt so desperately unhappy for all those who can never come out to their families, who must keep such a large and integral part of themselves unspoken.
Why only 4 stars, and not 5? Like some of the previous reviewers, I thought the ending was something of a cop-out. At the last minute, they decided to play it safe. Now, I'm a straightGal, but if I were a lesbian, I know I'd be disappointed by the last scene. However, I suppose the best way to look at it is this: The movie made a lot of strides as it was, showing attractive women as positive gay role models. I'm sure most folks would have to agree that the earliest attempts to dare depict male homosexual themes in mainstream American movies could only go so far. So why would you think that ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" ought to be different and could go the full distance as one of the first mainstream lesbian-themed movies?
Like John Hurt's wonderful depiction of Quentin Crisp in ""The Naked Civil Servant"", the two performances in ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" have given me something to think about in regards to attitudes towards same-sex relationships, while being very funny to boot. I'd recommend this movie to anyone except the extremely conservative, but maybe even they might be surprised by their own reactions.",1019433600,16,2525,4.6891891891891895
1300279,5,B00003CYJ4,"This movie is so hilarious...  Outstandingly funny!!!  Although
the story evolved around an ""unconventional"" type of love relationship, the actors (Heather & Jennifer) performance were
excellent. They did the movie in very good taste. I love Tovah Feldshuh(Jessica's Mom) I think her acting was great.",1019433600,,301,5.666666666666667
1300280,5,B00003CYJ4,"This is a movie that will hit home for oh so many singletons who know the scene too well and are searching for love in other, less explored, areas. Jessica takes a plunge and, for better or worse, she ends up with an unexpected result and a better, more profound, understanding of herself.
In a way, the movie is a hymn to making your own mistakes instead of gaining wisdom from mistakes of others. But isn't that true that you get to know thyself much better through a first-hand experience? Well, Jessica does exactly that, and the result is something we all wish for - better understanding of thyself and the world around.
On a negative side, the leading actress seemed to have either a speech impediment of some sort, or she was just poorly trained in the art of speech. Whatever it was, it made it difficult to understand her a few too many times.
Overall, this is a movie for those with an open mind, conservatives will probably have hard time grasping certain points of the movie.",1019433600,,987,4.5195530726256985
1300281,5,B00003CYJ4,"This was a wonderful beginning to what I hope is a more open-minded approach to romantic comedies--two strong, reletively secure, stable women who fall in love.  There are obvious neuroses (what would a romantic comedy be without it?) but the two women, Helen and Jessica, are impressively ""together"" all on their own.
Jessica Stein is a brilliant, but bored, copy editor whose boss happens to be an old flame from college.  Just when she has convinced herself that she isn't the problem--blaming everything the non-commital ...men of New York--her brother announces his engagement.  Mortified and a little worried about her own single status, Jessica makes a life-altering decision:  she answers a singles ad placed by another woman.
...I won't leak any details (because it's too funny to give away) but they're hilarious as they fumble through their relationship, learning as they go.
This movie is laden with great actresses, many of whom I've never seen before.  We'll doubtless see more of Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen (hopefully as a team, since they write and act exceptionally well together).  The wonderfully quirky performances of Jackie Hoffman (Joan) and Esther Wurmfeld (Grandma) are hilarious.
The most refreshing aspect of this movie is that it doesn't acknowledge the ""femme"" and ""butch"" stereotypes of lesbian relationships.  Also, Westfeldt and Juergensen have written a screenplay that beautifully depicts (FINALLY) a long-neglected truth:  sexuality is not black and white but rather fluid and ever-changing.  I'm sure this ""type"" relationship is more common than anyone likes to admit.  This movie is funny, quirky, fresh and all-around fun.  I highly recommend it!",1019088000,31,1699,5.3977272727272725
1300282,5,B00003CYJ4,"""Kissing Jessica Stein,"" directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, tells the story of a young, single, Jewish professional woman in New York City (the Jessica of the title, played by Jennifer Westfeldt). She's fed up with men after a series of bad experiences. Intrigued by a ""woman-seeks-woman"" personal ad, Jessic decides to give lesbianism a try. The object of her often clumsy affection is Helen (Heather Juergensen), a sexy art gallery manager.
This movie hooked me from its outrageous opening scene, in which Jessica, her mother, and her grandmother bicker and gossip about men during a Day of Atonement service. ""Jessica"" is a wonderfully funny and sweet film, filled with witty dialogue and some genuinely touching moments. The ensemble cast is superb. Westfeldt and Juergensen shine in the lead roles. Westfeldt, who looks remarkably like Lisa Kudrow, is reminiscent of a young female Woody Allen in this quirky, neurotic role. Juergensen brings an irreverent sensuality to her role. The two are delicious together. Although the whole supporting cast is great, I was particularly moved by Tovah Feldshuh as Jessica's loving mother.
I'm sure people will be tempted to pigeonhole ""Jessica"" as a ""lesbian"" movie, a ""New York"" movie, and/or a ""Jewish"" movie. It's certainly all of these, but its charm and universality also transcend all categories. It's about love, family ties, friendship, self-knowledge, and other issues that are relevant to everybody. And the film is populated with a wonderful group of characters -- male and female, Jewish and gentile, straight, gay, and ""bi-curious"" -- who are treated with affection and respect by the filmmakers. My advice: whatever your own preferences, prepare to kiss ""Jessica"" and love it.",1018915200,97,1737,5.32
1300283,3,B00003CYJ4,"Three stars? It was okay.  I actually left upset at the ending.  But eventually I realized that there really aren't enough dramas about lesbians and their lifes.  Comedies, yes.  But, no thought out films.
So, this film gets 3 stars for fresh writing.  Very natural acting, but the directing needs work.",1018915200,,303,4.862745098039215
1300284,4,B00003CYJ4,"Occasionally, you might hear a woman say she's given up on men.  This is a movie about one who tried.  Unfortunately, as the title character finds out, certain behaviors are not easy to change.
Jessica Stein, tired of bad dates, responds to a ""Women Seeking Women"" personal ad out of frustration and winds up in a lesbian relationship.  The comedy arises primarily out of her discomfort with this attempt to change her life.  Fortunately, this movie rises above gay stereotypes (for the most part) and treats its principal characters as fully developed human beings.
There are some imperfections in the movie, and there were sometimes when watching this movie when it seemed unoriginal.  But overall, this is a good movie and a different approach to a familiar genre.",1018396800,3,767,4.9609375
1300285,5,B00003CYJ4,"Written by the Jennifer Westfelt, (who plays Jessica) and  Heather Jurgensen (who plays Helen), this romantic comedy explores a romantic relationship between two women.  Both are typical New York urbanites, both are young and pretty and both have had their share of men.  But then, on a whim, Helen puts an ad in the newspaper seeking a woman.  Also on a whim, Jessica answers. The results are both real and funny and I found myself laughing out loud as they awkwardly get to know each other and ultimately fall in love.  There are complications of course.  Jessica's Jewish mother (Tovah Feldshuh) keeps trying to play matchmaker with a wide variety of men, her boss and former boyfriend (Scott Cohen) is still interested in her, and her brother's wedding is coming up to which she is reluctant to invite Helen.
I totally enjoyed this film.  It was the New York I know with the exception of the downtown skyline, which I understand, was purposely avoided because of the 9/11 tragedy. The characters were individuals, not stereotypes and the humor was really funny.  The director, Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, was able bring the humor to every scene and kept the tone lighthearted and real.  I'm not so sure I liked the ending, but there are hints throughout and certain inevitability to it.  Don't miss this small gem.  You'll not only come away smiling, but you'll get a bit of insight into a heretofore very lightly explored world.  Recommended.",1018310400,14,1444,4.872950819672131

Yes, the ending is bittersweet, but who wants the standard Hollywood schlock anyway? The relationship that is portrayed, and the way it plays out, struck me as very authentic and believable. Not to mention that the acting is great and it's the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time.

1300287,5,B00003CYJ4,"You never know what to expect of a movie about women and sex, but this one was a hoot. The actresses were pretty, sensual and sexy. The kissing scenes were hysterical. This movie has something for everyone: straights, lesbians, bi-sexuals, Jews and people from Scarsdale. If you fit one of these categories, it's for you. It shows us that you can never know where love can come from nor what form it might take. There is but one thing to hold dear: to thine own self, be true; ok, maybe two: don't take yourself too seriously.",1016755200,3,526,4.489583333333333
1300288,3,B00003CYJ4,"When you see this movie, you should remember that it was written and performed by two straight women. This movie is a straight romantic comedy, not a lesbian farce, as some have claimed. It is a romantic comedy that uses the device of homosexuality to be, perhaps, a little more thoughtful about some of the issues at stake than most are.
The characters in the film are sort of plausible, but the coherence of the story is not. (not atypical for a romantic comedy) The ""more sexual"" character, Helen, starts sleeping with women because she is curious, NOT BECAUSE SHE'S ATTRACTED TO WOMEN. And keeps doing it because of the quality of the sex. The more ""intellectual"" and ""emotional"" (also neurotic and out-of-touch with herself) character decides to ""go back"" to men and learns that the emotional connection doesn't need to be perfect. After all, the only perfect emotional connection can be with a woman, but the sex squicks her.
The entire movie has no discussion of women attracted to women. Only how enjoyable sex is. That strikes me as very, very odd.
These charicatures are a little unfortunate. There's nothing wrong with them, but the director could have done more work to make them dominate the movie so much.
all in all, this is a blast to see. Funny, etc. I just started to like it the more I thought about it.",1016582400,15,1322,4.6781115879828326
