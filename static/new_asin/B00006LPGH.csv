8298565,2,B00006LPGH,"Putting ""rape"" in a movie title is death for sales in English speaking countries.

This film is not nearly as good as the original Raped by an Angel. The story is slightly interesting, but I found the most enjoyment trying to figure out the real meaning of the English subtitles.  It is about rape and attempted rape, just so there isn't any confusion.

For once, the DVD cover isn't lying and a few of the women were attractive, but no nearly as the girls in the first film.

If you haven't seen the 1st film, see that first and know that this one is 2-stars lower.",1428537600,,566,4.311320754716981
8298566,5,B00006LPGH,"This movie has a serious plot by nature, but this movie is a comedy.  The main characters are hilarious.  This movie is great and should be watched by thriller fans everywhere.  There's not much nudity, just a below average amount of topless women in an erotic thriller.  The nudity is not a major part or a crutch for the film.  The story is about a serial rapist, but do not allow the major plot line affect your viewing.  Watch the movie and you should enjoy it.",1234310400,5,465,4.348837209302325
