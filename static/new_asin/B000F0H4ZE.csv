8465881,2,B000F0H4ZE,"Our first newborn is about to arrive so I bought this based on the previous reviews. The DVD fell a little short and did not cover some key aspects (e.g. diapers). Other aspects (e.g. feeding) are covered better. If I had the chance to do it again, I would not buy it.",1215820800,,268,4.173076923076923
8465882,5,B000F0H4ZE,"This was what we needed when we brought home our twins. It was practical, speaking to us in a way we could here it and understand (and replay again when our frazzled brains felt like we couldn't remember what we'd seen just days before!).",1145836800,,238,4.431818181818182
8465883,5,B000F0H4ZE,"A childbirth educator friend of mine loaned me her copy of this program to watch when I was pregnant with my twins. It all seems so easy when the nurses in the hospital are helping you. But once you get the babys home it's a whole new ballgame. This program covers all essential baby care and safety I needed to know and helped me through those first frightening days. What I liked best about it was that it presnted the information in a friendly, non-judgmental way. Oh, the cartoons are kinda funny too.",1145404800,,505,4.440860215053763
8465884,5,B000F0H4ZE,"As a new parent, I found this program to be so helpful.

I share it with my other friends.

It help us to deal with some of the basics. It also gave me information about how to address some more sensitive topics.",1145318400,,212,4.023809523809524
8465885,5,B000F0H4ZE,"I love this dvd, it really helps new parents by giving them the information they need to make it through the first weeks at home with a newborn. This is the best video I have ever viewed with information on before, during and after maternity stays.",1144713600,,248,4.413043478260869
