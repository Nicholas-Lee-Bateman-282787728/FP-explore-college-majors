7951360,3,B00005QZRA,"First of all I'm not sure why they called this movie The Girl Next Door when one, there are a heap of movies out there called that title, and two it's not about the girl living next door to anyone.  Perhaps the caring police psychologist woman was originally supposed to move in next door and get to know the girl while chatting over the fence or something, but really the movie should have been called, If You Love Me, You'll Shoot My Wife, or something like that.

Basically the plot of this one revolves around a teen/maybe twenty year old being dragged into a police station by a priest who tells the front desk that the girl has something to tell them.  She clearly doesn't want to talk but the priest mentions she dreams about a murder so a police psychologist who is one of those I just won't go home my life revolves around work types, is called down to talk to her.  She doesn't get much out of her except she mentions bad dreams but since they got her details when she first came in the psychologist decides to home visit her, much against the we've got actual crimes to solve arguments from the others.  There she plants the seed for the girl to contact her again when her visit is interrupted by two step kids coming home who the girl obviously doesn't want them to know who she is.  Eventually the girl contacts her and the movie is really her flashbacks of how she met a corrupt cop (who I'm pretty sure she never caught onto was corrupt), who saved her from a domestic violence situation who upon seeing that she wasn't able to do anything to get the guy to leave when she asked him to and he refused, knew she would be an easy target to bed and carry out his own evil plans.

There isn't really much to this story.  We already know what happened pretty early on, we're even shown it in a flashback scene about half way through, you're expecting some sort of twist or payoff for watching, at least for the dirty cop to kill the psychologist, try and kill the girl, perhaps the kids could have mentioned the woman visited them and he recognises her name, he could have at least been aware of the wire and not played along then gagged her before she could let on to the police or something.  I originally thought this isn't doing anything because it must be based on a true story, but we're never told that at the beginning or end. We do have one of those low budget endings where we sum up what happened in the years after by a paragraph or two on the screen.  But really when this thing ends you're left thinking, that was a complete waste or time.

I didn't recognise any of the actors in this as having been in anything else other than this 1998 film.  Their acting wasn't bad or anything it's just there was no script for them to do anything to make a name for themselves with this one.",1449273600,,2804,4.2897727272727275
7951361,3,B00005QZRA,"The tale unfolds in flashback as a  police psychologist ,played well by Sharron Glass,seeks to unravel the actions of a young woman (Tracy Gold)who claims she murdered her  policeman lover's wife at his instigation .Did she ?or is she using the story as a mask and really intended to kill the woman all along ? Or perhaps she is wholly innocent and someone else is the guilty party for whom she is covering .

These are the questions raised and the movie takes us to the truth behind the accusation .It does so with the aid of some very good acting and smooth direction but the script is underpowered and the movie ,while well made and watchable ,is a little lacking in excitement .Still,all in all a nice enough little picture for a quiet evening in fron of the box ,but not top drawer by any means",1205107200,4,799,4.421768707482993
