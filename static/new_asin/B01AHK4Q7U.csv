8747410,1,B01AHK4Q7U,"Worst direct to video movie I have ever seen. I don't know who is paying people for these five/four star reviews, but this movie is bad. Its so bad that it took me three days to finish it from sheer annoyance alone. For a movie than was funded for 9.5 thousand dollars its ridiculously cheap. The story is nonsensical, the sets are nonexistent, and if the acting was any less believable youd think it was populated solely by Big Foot. Save yourself the agony of watching this turd and just burn your cash in an ashtray. Itll be a perfect simulation for the experience of ordering this cinematic abortion.",1530921600,,604,4.5504587155963305
8747411,5,B01AHK4Q7U,"""Blood Sombrero"" is a Surrealistic Action, Crime, Horror Conglomeration, with Humor & Plenty of Beautiful Women !!!
  It also has a Mix of Film Styles Reminiscent of Early ""Rodriguez"" esp.""El Mariachi"",""Tarantino"" without the Inane Dialogue Soliloquies,& ""Guy Ritchie""'s Cut-Away Scenes ! Witches, Mortals, Immortals, You Know What ? It All WORKS !!!
  The Scenes are Lively, The Acting is a Little Flamboyant [But it Fits the Tone of the Film],& there are Tons of Beautiful Naked & Half-Naked Ladies, None More Beautiful than Young SHERI DAVIS in a Supporting Role that I would have liked to See Expanded !
  There's an Ensemble Cast that Does an Amazing Job; But the Main Stars are BILLY BLAIR as a Stoic Anti-Hero, & Athletic & Beautiful Young PAULA MARCENARO SOLINGER Portraying ""Josephine"" a Mortal/ImMortal/SortOfMortal Savior of a Magic Box !!!
  It's All Great Fun !!!",1469491200,,876,5.119718309859155
8747412,4,B01AHK4Q7U,"This is a fun low budget grindhouse that lacked continuity. The Thief (Billy Blair) is commissioned by Lucifer (Nick Gomez) to get a box that is protected by Josephine (Paula Marcenaro Solinger) an unpolished poorly choreographed macabre Uma Thurman lite. There is a bounty hunter and a couple of cops who add to the great characters. Somehow a honeybee got wrote into the script that really had nothing to do with the movie other than to add filler and give director/writer Jennifer Michelle Stone II a role. Not that it wasn't a cute part, I was just confused how it fit in and why the film never returned to the beginning when it started its flashback, like any half decent scripted film.

The choreography fighting was bad except for a couple of fighters with minor roles, most likely the only professionals. They did a lot of slow motion filming to cover up the bad movements...which BTW were the movements they actually wanted as they have extra features showing us the 3 minutes of fight rehearsals.

About half way through the film the dead gypsy fortune teller lets us know some useless information about the box and where all these extra characters are coming from. It isn't until the end that we find out.

Guide: F-word. No sex. Front loaded stripper nudity. Worth a view. 4 star camp value.",1462752000,,1303,4.706140350877193
8747413,5,B01AHK4Q7U,"What a delightful treat out of Dallas, Texas!  Action packed, adventurous, character driven and comical at times.

Cinematography was stellar! 5 Stars!!!!!",1462320000,,281,5.363636363636363
8747414,5,B01AHK4Q7U,"Billy Blair II & crew kill it! (Everyone actually) if you didn't order it, or any Girlscout cookies? You should. They're both delicious!

The perfect gift for birthdays, weddings, anniversarys or bar mitzvahs. Particularly for that difficult to shop for ""has everything"" friend.",1462320000,,278,5.465116279069767
8747415,5,B01AHK4Q7U,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this and I'm glad I went ahead and watched it. I was laughing my ass off the whole time. The humor, the action and the sexy chicks were worth it.",1460505600,2,179,3.864864864864865

8747417,5,B01AHK4Q7U,"Fast paced, funny, action packed and bloody as hell. Sexy martial arts chicks chopping fools left and right. Awesome! Kinda like hobo with a shot gun but with a Mexican twist.",1459123200,2,175,4.67741935483871
8747418,5,B01AHK4Q7U,I can't wait to get this movie. It looks sick and full of action. The story plot and characters  are completely  awesome,1459036800,3,120,4.409090909090909
