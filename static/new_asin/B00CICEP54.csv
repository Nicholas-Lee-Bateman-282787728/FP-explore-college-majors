8582005,4,B00CICEP54,"I am not sure what the Jagged Ice review is all about but I am going to talk about the movie itself. I think it is a really good movie, a hidden gem I have never seen before. This probably did lose out to such slasher films as Friday the 13th as it came out around the same time. Definitely a good watch if you're a classic slasher film fan. The only complaints I can think about making for the film are the sometimes stiff acting in the film, and the goofiness of the killer. Most of the time the acting is actually pretty good and the killer is done really well in a creepy sorta way. I do recommend this film for sure. If you know of any other good slasher films from the same time period lemme know in the comments and if I haven't seen them before I will check them out. Thanks for reading!",1404345600,2,795,4.037974683544304
