4111898,3,B003DF459G,"It was difficult to understand their English.  At times it was little too slow.  I think they are wonderful tales that
should not be forgotten.  I story-tell them to my grandchildren and maybe when they are older they can understand
the movie. I am glad I bougth them",1359590400,,267,4.520833333333333
4111899,5,B003DF459G,I saw this movie in the theater and loved it ever since.  I purchased it for my daughter and it is among her favorites too.,1320710400,,123,3.92

4111901,5,B003DF459G,"Secret of Roan Inish is just a delightful film and not Disneyesque.  Whale Rider is fun.  Nice for children as they see Irish culture, Maori culture.  Wonderful addition to family film collection and appropriate for all ages.",1278547200,8,225,5.027027027027027

4111904,4,B003DF459G,"Two great films.  I was only going for one, but when I saw the combo pack I couldn't resist.",1405123200,,92,3.8421052631578947
4111905,5,B003DF459G,"These two films are a great combo especially for young girls.  They emphasize family values without being preachy.  They may be a little slow for our immediate gratification youngsters today, but they are standards, not animated, and wonderfully presented regarding different, but amazingly similar, values of love, family and tradition.  In addition, the grandparent role is clearly shown in a world that has forgotten them.",1395878400,,425,5.507692307692308
4111906,5,B003DF459G,"Packaging these two films together was a terrific idea as the protagonists are both courageous girls, one mid-century Irish and the other present-day Maori. This is a wonderful gift for young girls, and both ""Whale Rider"" and ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" are also for adult audiences. The first is written and directed by an New Zealand woman, Niki Caro, and the latter is written and directed by one of America's premier independent filmmakers, John Sayles. Children and adults adults alike will enjoy the girls' relationships with wild creatures, and the heroic way in which they redeem their family and community.",1395619200,2,614,5.089108910891089
4111907,5,B003DF459G,the kids (7 year old girls) love this movie. The pace is much slower than what they usually watch and the irish accents are thick and they still love it,1393459200,,152,4.1
4111908,5,B003DF459G,"It seems futile to find well done family films that are not animated cartoons these days. For those kids who are old enough to appreciate films that are not patronizing these are two of the best in one DVD. You will have a great family night watching these two, and there will be surely a lot of post movie conversation after each of these. What is wonderfule is these are two of the few films that portray young women in a favorable light as intelligent and thoughtful. Both of these films deal with girls embedded in a a cultural mileau that is challenging to our modern world view, but not  without worth. Watch them both with your children and be prepared to see just how thoightful they can be when given a chance.",1392076800,,719,4.406015037593985
4111909,5,B003DF459G,I saw it a while back and loved it. Don't know who the little girl is but she deserved an award for her great acting.,1391385600,,117,3.72
4111910,5,B003DF459G,movies work in strange and wonderful ways.  these two movies fill the bill. I recommend these movies with 10s and more..,1380758400,3,120,4.714285714285714
4111911,4,B003DF459G,"Roan Inish is the reason for the order.  I love that.  Whale Rider was also very good.  I had also seen that before and prefer R.I.
but I would Strongly recommend Whale Rider especially for thos with a love of the sea and respect for it creatures.",1376524800,3,247,4.212765957446808
8394777,5,B003DF459G,A good movie to watch and great to show my student about the people of these islands.,1502064000,,85,4.0588235294117645
8394778,5,B003DF459G,"Two foreign movies in one package. Priced great. Arrived on time and in good condition. Whale rider is about a young Maori girl in New Zealand who dreams of becoming a leader in a traditional society. Very moving. The Secret of Roan Inish is about a young Irish girl in the 1940's who sees a a beautiful mythical creature (part woman/ part seal) called a Selkie. Fiona and her young cousin and her grandparents lives take interesting turns, and it is a good story. Both of these movies offer beautiful scenic views.",1477872000,,515,4.608695652173913
