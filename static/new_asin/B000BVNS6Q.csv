8093187,5,B000BVNS6Q,"The story of the history of Popes, where they came from, what they did, and the results of their choices. The story follows a time line. It is unfortunate that they stop just as it is getting good.

There are a lot of great pictures of people and places. You feel that you were there.

This is a worth while series and unless you are an expert on the material covered you may need to view it several times as they must speed through time to cover all the bases. Of course they the producers have their own spin on history; yet they are not obnoxious with a view that overshadows the facts.",1504569600,,589,4.20353982300885
8093188,4,B000BVNS6Q,This was a good documentary outlining the struggles of a couple to experience marriage.  It deals with homophobia from family and from the Roman Catholic Church.  Any couple wanting to help their parents understand the struggles  that same-sex couples face when trying to validate their love through marriage should use this documentary.,1388620800,,337,5.4423076923076925
8093189,5,B000BVNS6Q,"Religion is a very important part in the life of many same sex couples. However, it was interesting to see how this couple wants to receive the church's blessing for their union, but they were denied because they are gay. Most of the churches I know of teach that we are all the SAME and MUST love and respect each other. On the other hand,  some of these churches allow and bless their members for showing disrespect and hate toward gay individuals. Why can't we learn to respect someone else's life style and/or point of view even if we think it is wrong? Who is judging our own? This documentary shows different points of view regarding same sex unions.",1372809600,,656,4.512605042016807
8093190,5,B000BVNS6Q,"A moving story of two people in love, Edward and Vincent, and their fight for equal rights. It's about people who determined to celebrate their relationship on their terms.

""Saints and Sinners"" explores the social, political and religious aspects of same-sex marriage and examines its effect on American society. It shows how unfairly the Catholic Church treats gays and lesbians. (For Edward, who grew up as an altar boy, and Vincent, who was baptized at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in Little Italy and who attends Sunday Mass regularly, getting married outside the Catholic tradition is not an option.) Powerful argument for legalization of gay marriage.",1140307200,7,657,5.257142857142857
