826355,4,6304286805,"A Nice little sex farce with some interesting folks in 60,s New York City.
Jane is put upon a bit  and the double entendre dialogue gets a bit tired in some scenes. Robert Culp the would be suitor to Jane coming in for a visit. Rod Taylor  and Jane essaying the values of stick pins and broaches brining guy and girl together.
And then we have Cliff Robertson who seems to wonder why he is in this film at all with his own hokey dialogue. Jim Backus adds some fun and its all really harmless and engaging I suppose..
One of the debits is not enough Eddy Duchin music...
Note: In this film the New York City Busses look very clean ,,now thats nostagilc in itself..

826356,5,6304286805,"Maybe not my most favorite movies of all time, but it is at the top of the list.  Soundtrack to this movie was terrific.  I have the original soundtrack album, but wish they would put it on CD. Jane Fonda was great in this movie.  I was in love with her before the ""Hanoi Jane"" days.  Still a good movie.  Wonderful acting and writing.",1072742400,14,335,4.171875
826357,5,6304286805,"I would describe this film as totally delightful and fun.  I enjoyed the simplistic morality of Pre-Sexual Revolution Dating of the 60's.  The actors are well cast and give great performances.  But one other element that makes this movie great is the MUSIC!  My mother was a music & movie buff who deemed ""Sunday in New York"" as one of the best because of the contribution of one of her favorite pianists, Peter Nero (who also makes a cameo appearance in this movie).  Nero's music is expertly woven within the fabric of this movie and adds just the right touch to make this film terrific!",1039910400,21,589,4.571428571428571
826358,5,6304286805,"This is one of about 10 movies that, like today, I can't NOT watch if I come across it on TV, no matter how many times I've seen it - it's that much fun. It features a wonderful cast of principals - not just Jane Fonda (in her ""Barefoot in the Park"" days), but Rod Taylor, Cliff Robertson and Robert Culp, all of whom have two extended scenes together that are marvels of comic timing and reaction (the previously mentioned restaurant scene, and the scene in the apartment leading up to it). It's a classic romantic comedy, that neatly and sweetly captures the tipping point in time just before everything changed between men and women.",1019433600,20,636,4.539130434782609
826359,5,6304286805,"This one is great to watch on a rainy afternoon.  I love all the major stars and they have a great presence with each other. It reminds one of less complicated times. A pleasure to watch. Hopefully it'll come out in DVD in the future, along with some of my other older favorites, ""Mary, Mary"", and ""Period of Adjustment"".",1019347200,4,321,4.440677966101695
826360,3,6304286805,"A Real Period Piece. Is this a 60, sex farce? Is this a New York Comedy? Whatever ..it is engaging to say the least. Jane Fonda seems to have problems with her jewelry and seems to get stuck on guys like Rod Taylor..in a New York Bus. This leads to some comical scenes..and Jane is in fine form ..alluring and fast talking about sexual moires of that time.
Robert Culp plays her fiance...Cliff Robertson , her brother who always seems to missing his plane ( as Pilot) Rod Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable( probably due to the lines he is given)
JIm Backus adds to the mayhem in his own special way. There are fine views of Rockefeller Center as well as other NY Sites.
Light and amusing fluff that is fun to watch because of the charisma of the players..Consider after this sex farce , Ms. Fonda would embark on films such as"" Barberella "" and "" They Shoot Horses Dont They""

826361,5,6304286805,"For a movie with subject matter more than just a little dated,
I was amazed at how funny this is. The actors are terrific.
Fonda is very young here and before she started taking herself
so seriously. Great fun throughout.",1003104000,6,221,4.55
826362,5,6304286805,"If only life was like this now.  Robes spread in open view on the sofa to imply your mother was 'at home' and thus fend off romantic advances from middle-aged sports reporters.
Ahhhh.... A funny, warm, feel-good movie in the days when life was a lot simpler.  Jane Fonda being extremely funny too - her naivety being extremely believable.
If you want to smile and see life in a more innocent time, and with great views of a clean and under-populated NYC....watch it.",1002931200,7,466,4.602409638554217
826363,5,6304286805,"This is a great movie!  If you like romantic comedies, this is one of the best.  The music is wonderful, the acting is superb, but it is the writing that really sets it apart from many other romantic comedies.  I first saw this many years ago, and I've watched it dozens of times since then.  The charisma between Fonda and Taylor is terrific, and Cliff Robertson is outstanding as Fonda's brother.  One of my top ten favorite movies of all time.",983059200,8,446,4.45679012345679

826568,2,6304286805,"Robertson has more chemistry with Fonda than Taylor, so it's all rather odd.
Fonda keeps pouring on the charm & then changing her mind. She wants to get married, but thinks that men will be more inclined to propose once she's a virgin or at the very least they will be obligated to marry her is she has sex with them.
This really is how society has always been !
 Good acting for what it's worth, but all pretty cringe worthy & stupid.",1466812800,,435,4.240963855421687

826835,5,6304286805,"I love these films released prior to the MPAA ratings system where subject matter considered taboo is discretely alluded to and danced around.  The topic of sex is referred to but never shown.  The scriptwriters would have to cleverly tiptoe around the subject which makes for a more satisfying experience than if graphic sex and nudity is on display.  Our main character is Eileen (Jane Fonda), a 22 year old virgin debating whether to give up the ghost.  For reasons too numerous to recount this sets off a chain reaction of comic events  involving Eileen, her brother Adam(Cliff Robertson), and a poor slob from Philadelphia named Mike (Rod Taylor) which include lies, half-truths, mistaken identity and whatnot.  Clothes are ruined and people inexplicably end up in bathrobes and girlfriends are on a one-way flight for Pittsburgh.  When the laughter subsides you're left with a lot of food for thought about sexual attitudes circa 1963.  New York looks fabulous and Peter Nero offers up a terrific score.  If you are looking for a satisfying film experience this comic chestnut fills the bill.",1435881600,4,1098,5.0220994475138125

Robertson is very, very good as the playboy pilot, Rod Taylor is stalwart and likeable as Fonda's love interest and there are fine turns by Jim Backus, Robert Culp and Jo Morrow.  Lively, amusing and high-spirited by a great cast.  Not to be missed.  Also, enjoy Peter Nero's on screen

A happy experience is the description I would attach to this movie. It is on DVD-R but the picture and sound quality were just fine for me. Story and acting are what's important in my view.

827590,5,6304286805,"Virgins that is, so pretty, nubile Eileen Tyler (Jane Fonda) jokes after her older brother airline pilot Adam (Cliff Robertson) swears on his sacred honor that he has never slept with a woman.  In truth though, Eileen is the only one left since Adam is a randy fellow who gets around his oath on a technicality.  Eileen's problem is one that many nicely brought up young women were facing circa 1963, is a ""good girl"" supposed to go to bed with a fianc or at least a steady beau to cinch getting married?  Her ex boyfriend Russ Wilson (Robert Culp) certainly thinks so; it's the reason they broke up after a long relationship.  He was tired of going to the gym to play handball three times a week, if you get his drift.  A wounded and troubled Eileen flees from her parent's home in Albany NY one Sunday morning to visit Adam who lives in Manhattan, and hopefully get some male advice on this sensitive issue.  He emphatically tells her to remain chaste, but certainly doesn't practice what he preaches.  His girlfriend Mona Harris (Jo Morrow) and he are lovers in every sense of the word, and spend a good deal of Sunday unsuccessfully trying to find a place to make love since Eileen is staying at Adam's.  Meanwhile Eileen meets a very attractive man Mike Mitchell (Rod Taylor) on a Fifth Avenue bus.  After an initial awkward start they are drawn to one another to the point that Eileen begins to have second thoughts about safeguarding her virtue.  Then a repentant Russ drives down from Albany to reconcile with Eileen and propose marriage.  Get the picture?

If I've piqued your curiosity with the above brief synopsis, let me give you some other reasons I recommend this movie.  Let's start with the main one, Jane Fonda.  Although with the exception of ""Barefoot in the Park"", Ms. Fonda tends to dismiss or ignore her early ingnue roles in romantic comedies, she does herself an injustice with ""Period of Adjustment"" and this film.  Here she skillfully essays a true character, the gently nurtured, intelligent young woman in her early twenties, confronted with an age-old dilemma, should she or shouldn't she?  Her confusion and uncertainty are touchingly real, as she tries to remain faithful to the traditional values in which she was raised, yet questioning their validity in this atomic age.  Her Eileen Tyler has depth and is not just a vapid virgin; she is bright, spirited and forthright.  In addition she is scrumptious to behold, in full bloom of her young womanhood, with a glowing countenance, tawny haired and nicely curvaceous.  Rod Taylor has the requisite manliness and virility in his manner without the blustering bravado that makes him very appealing, and an ideal partner for Ms. Fonda.  The Adam of Cliff Robertson is a rascal, but an ingratiating one, and you truly feel his love and concern in his protective attitude towards his little sister.  In lesser roles, Robert Culp is right on target as Russ, the perfect clean cut All American guy, and Jo Morrow is properly exasperated as the put upon Mona.

Here's a few more reasons, an engaging, slightly naughty script by Norman Krasna in an adaption of his Broadway play, on location filming in Manhattan offering marvelous vistas of Rockefeller Center, Central Park and the upper East Side, and an insinuating title tune smoothly crooned by Mel Torme.  The color cinematography is vibrant, and I especially liked Cliff Robertson's swinging 60's bachelor pad.

Yes, this is a guilty pleasure, but with an emphasis on the word pleasure, it won't improve your mind, but it will put a smile on your face!",1319587200,7,3583,4.798045602605863

Sunday in New York (Peter Tewksbury), USA 1963
With 'Sexual Revolution' in its wake (or was it just Hollywood Studios beginning to break in on the subject?) Rod Taylor is fishing for young Jane Fonda (or was it the other way round?!) All well-behaved but charming!

827662,3,6304286805,"I will swear in open court that there must have been two directors for this movie.

Cannot think of a better example of a real-world Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in Director Peter Tewksbury. I'm at a complete loss as to how to explain it otherwise. Because there are two completely different halves to this movie. I'm not exaggerating.

The first half is utterly worthless. The performances, particularly that of Jane Fonda, are especially forced and wooden. A classic example of why you don't use stage actors for films, or at least 'stage performances'. Everyone is too loud, exaggerating every movement and every utterance. At some points in the film the players are virtually screaming their lines. Which, again, is perfect for the stage; projection is a must-have skill there. But every acting coach will tell you that film is so much more subtle. Film captures minutiae, the camera and audio recorders are in your face - the projection of character has to occur *internally*. Acting 101.

And speaking of the basic rules of filmmaking, there are few movies that can match 'Sunday' in describing ""inappropriate musical score"" - it's truly offensive. Blaring harsh staccato jazz is great for dark brooding dramas; black and white noir films virtually demand this kind of sound. But for a bright funny comedy? How blatantly gauche can one be? This is the equivalent of strapping calliope carnival ditties onto 'The Godfather'.

That's the first half Mr. Hyde at the wheel.

Then, and don't ask me to explain who, how or why, but midway through - Dr. Jekyll appears to have taken over the director's seat.

Inexplicably, just about the time they introduce Robert Culp's character as Fonda's first suitor/boyfriend, the movie suddenly becomes what I thought it was going to be - a truly funny 60's romp. The horrendous jazz score is replaced with a soft, light and bouncy accompaniment with proper sweeps into the film as needed. And the actors seem to suddenly realize that, even though this was originally a Broadway production, that they're actually on a film set. Boom, everyone is instantly in a movie. And dangit, it's a really hilarious second half.

What the heck?

So I'm at a loss at how to rate this film. The abhorrent first half would be an easy two stars, maybe bordering a single five-pointer. Then there's the very enjoyable second half which would be an easy four, no problem.

I don't want to rate it a three just to split the difference, that smacks of a copout. But Amazon doesn't allow dual grades. <g>

Call it a three in the hope that you'll enjoy the second half as much as I did. And that, again hopefully, the second half will cancel out or blur the first.

[Edited] I understand that one-time 'star' pianist Peter Nero had great influence in the score. Proving once again that when films add momentary music - it very quickly becomes dated and inappropriate. It's something that has seen a resurgence in the last few years. And proves another adage: People who forget history are doomed to repeat it. It won't be too long before we're watching some television program or film and we'll collectively cringe in embarrassment. It's already happened to me with shows like 'House, M.D.' and 'Battlestar Galactica'.",1312502400,7,3228,4.850909090909091

In todays jaded sexual environment we might laugh at her plight but the reality is that every young person thinks about the same thing she does - should she or shouldn't she?  While she is certainly not teenager we can empathise with her delimma.  But the real focus of this charmer is how Fonda and Taylor meet by accident and in the space of a few hours find a life time of love.  Yes, it is fiction but who cares.

She is reeling from a fight with her fianc Russ who is giving her undue pressure to put out before they marry. Adam assures her that waiting for the wedding night is the right thing to do and then deceives her into thinking he is doing the same. Naturally, he turns out to be a womanizer planning to shag his girlfriend that day. Feeling like the only virgin in the world, Eileen meanwhile engages in a flirtation with a reporter named Mike Mitchell. Complications ensue with mistaken identities and morality questions thrown in to make the plot more interesting.

As if you couldn't tell from the swinging title tune sung by Mel Torme, the film is an idealization of early-1960's Manhattan single life that merely toys with the idea of premarital sex well before the concept of free love came into vogue. Guided by TV director Peter Tewksbury, there is a mechanical sitcom feel to the proceedings, but the real NYC locations help and the three leads are game players. Fonda is adorably adroit in a preview of her bouncier work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barefoot-in-the-Park/dp/6305537356/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barefoot in the Park</a>, and Cliff Robertson plays Adam's double-standard hypocrisy with agility.

If you're looking for a perfectly dated view of premarital sex, youll be hard-pressed to find another gem like Sunday in New York. Jane Fonda, in a totally adorable role, plays a conflicted beginner. Shes refused to sleep with her boyfriend, Robert Culp, and in her confusion, seeks refuge with her airline pilot brother, Cliff Robertson. Cliff assures her that being a virgin isn't a bad thing and that he himself doesnt sleep around. Of course, hes desperately trying to sleep with his girlfriend, Jo Morrow, and hides that from Jane. To top it all off, Jane meets Rod Taylor and decides to pretend shes more experienced than she actually is.

Adapted from Norman Krasnas hit Broadway play, this 1960s romantic comedy is just that: romantic and hilarious. Janes comic timing is always great. In movies, this is where the screen usually goes dark, she says when Rods kisses make it clear he wants to take things further. When he finally learns shes a virgin, he slams on the brakes. He doesnt want to be responsible for ruining her reputation, and Jane finds his reasoning absurd. He wouldnt have any hesitation in sleeping with her if, say, in a weeks time shed already had a lover. Call me next week! she shouts, frustrated that her innocence is off-putting.

Its really a very cute movie, but womens libbers out there will probably hate it. Youre better off watching The Electric Horseman or The China Syndrome; Jane is in a strong, feminist role in those movies. In Sunday in New York, shes cute as a button, but not the most liberated tool in the shed. I loved her in this one, and found her just as visually and comically adorable as she was in Barefoot in the Park.",1506556800,,1738,4.636363636363637

7866669,5,6304286805,"This movie is a product of its time. Eileen Tyler (Jane Fonda) is being told that being virtuous until one is married is the ideal. Just look at her brother. But do not look in his closet or the story will begin. Pour Mike Mitchell (Rod Taylor) is drawn in and out, like a yo-yo. In addition, the Restaurant scene can not be surpassed. Flights keep being missed. How will it all turn out for a Sunday in New York?",1501804800,,413,4.175
