7177196,4,B00XN5UCY8,"I watched this movie because it got such good reviews...and it was well done, and it was amusing, and it did offer a glimpse into what young people go through in the IDF military (at least on the ladies side of things.)

However, the ""humor"" did not really come through for me and this is probably because I don't speak Hebrew. It was really obvious which situations were supposed to be funny, and why, but they just did not make me laugh. Maybe because it was too obvious? I thought that on the one hand, the humor was too heavy handed - some of the haha situations were too ""hammed"" up - but on the other hand there was not enough subtle irony in the dark humor situations. And they had such potential!! The whole movie is a great concept.... I think it must be a language thing though - I come from Europe where there is this genre of movies, too, but it just did not translate at the emotional level.",1436140800,,904,4.255813953488372

The three main characters, Admin LT, one admin assistant who would become an officer and one, Zohan, the center of the story.

7177215,5,B00XN5UCY8,"This film is about self-absorbed female conscripts killing time in an admin office on an army base somewhere in Israel. The characters are well-developed, quirky, and a treat to watch, especially ""Dana Ivgy"" and ""Shani Klein"" (look for more from both of these great actresses in the future). The style of comedy is original and refreshing and nothing like what has been coming out of Hollywood. Director/writer Talya Lavie spent five years writing the story, based on her experience as a secretary during military service, before filming began. The film won the best narrative feature at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. The entire cast did a fantastic job, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music score perfect. The dvd itself has an extensive ""extra section"" with multitude of interviews with the cast, a shorter initial experimental version, and a 2-minute-long animation ""The Waitress"" made by the same director in 2000 that is also a gem. Also, the English subtitles are easily readable.",1456876800,4,1010,5.127272727272727
7177216,5,B00XN5UCY8,"This movie is about several young women who are starting their compulsory military service (two years for women) in the Israeli Army. The title says it all:  They are in a non-combat unit where their duties are mainly administrative. One young woman takes on the designation, ""Official Paper Shredder"", and even that is something she does half-heartedly at best. The story is told from the point of view of one particular gal who feels insecure that she has not yet lost her virginity, and she decides to make that her mission. But her goal is thrown off by certain surprise occurrences. Her friendship with another young woman in her unit is tested as they reach different levels of promotion, and how they respond is absurd, hilarious, and occasionally dark, just like the emotional tone of the entire film. Underneath everything is the sense that these are very typical young people just doing their time until they are done with the army.  I rarely want to rewatch most Israeli films because they are so intense and tend to address difficult subjects within Israeli society, but somehow, this one was irreverent and funny enough to make me want to watch it again.",1456617600,3,1167,4.83

7177219,5,B00XN5UCY8,"You'll especially like this film if you hate Israel, because it rakes its army across the coals. Can Israel's military really be this sexist, this unmotivated, this undisciplined? Entirely satire, I hope.

I love Israel, and I love this movie. It made me laugh even while I was cringing. (The cringing because I spent a career in the US Army, and I'd have fired up Zohar, and Daffi would've never become an officer.)

But it's a satire, right? Reminding myself of that, this film made me laugh as much as any in years. Kind of a mashup of  ""Office Space"" and ""SGT Bilko"" and ""MASH.""

Except that in this movie, as in ""MASH"" but not ""Office"" and ""Bilko,"" we really care for the characters. Even when they're obnoxious, spoiled  brats, we can't help but like them.

Put the kiddies to bed first. Who'd have guessed the language of the Torah could include a potty mouth?",1445904000,2,867,4.561290322580645

7177223,4,B00XN5UCY8,"Set in a military admin office in a remote Israeli military base, this tragi-comedy takes you through the various frustrations of the conscript soldiers doing sorta-kinda-non-work during their service.  All the roles well acted, lots there for military folks to enjoy, but also enough emotional/bureaucratic doings to appeal to anyone who hasn't been in the military.",1443052800,2,367,5.553571428571429

7177225,5,B00XN5UCY8,"Great movie, wish the stories just kept going since there is lots of material is there to work with",1441497600,,99,4.2631578947368425
7177226,4,B00XN5UCY8,"This first full-length feature from writer/director Talya Lavie presents a unique take on conscripted service into the IDF from a female perspective. The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.

Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: ""01: The Replacement""; ""02: The Virgin"" and ""03: The Commander"". The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Wings/dp/B000255L98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Wings</a>. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.

The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.

The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can.",1440979200,5,1877,4.964856230031949
7177227,4,B00XN5UCY8,"I don't know what to make if this.  It is good, it is weird... but it doesn't fit anything I know.
This is three stories, interrrelated, of three women soldiers in a forgotten army base.  There is nothing to do there except play Minesweeper all day and somehow keep your cool in the desert.  And the women don't keep their cool.
This is the army for most people.  Boredom and paperwork.  The stories are detached and mildly sympathetic.  This is not three stooges funny.  This is sad and rueful funny.  If you go to it with the right attitude, it is a good film.",1439510400,3,562,4.336538461538462

7177232,3,B00XN5UCY8,The movie was good. The sound on this movie is messed up. The dialog has a forward echo so that you actually can hear the dialog a couple of seconds bsfore its actually spoken. The forward echo sounds like background chatter. Then you hear the actress say her lines and realize that what you heard 2 seconds earlier is actually the actress as a forward echo. This should be fixed.,1437350400,,380,4.442857142857143

8716336,3,B00XN5UCY8,"Frankly, it was hard for me, a veteran of the US Army, to believe how the military people behaved in this film, but I suppose the Israeli Army is free to adopt its own customs and traditions.
The film does what it claims -- explores the lives of female soldiers assigned as HQ staff to do paperwork to a combat unit based out in the middle of nowhere.
The problem is that, cute though some of the situations are, none of them really develop into anything worth while.
Of course, an /Israeli/ audience might feel quite differently about that.",1518134400,,541,4.474747474747475
