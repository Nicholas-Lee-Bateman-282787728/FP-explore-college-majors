8365016,3,B002DCCK9M,This is one of many Grandes Pealas dvds i own. I think i like this one the least. Three fights on this dvd and two of them have spanish commentary wich makes it alot less enjoyable for me. The Zarate-Zaragoza fight is in english. The Marquez vs Barrera fight is in Spanish and really was not a great fight in my opinion. I expected more action from Marco Antonio Barrera. still it is a nice edition to my fight libarary. The Raton Macias fight is black and white and also in spanish. Great if you speak that but i have just very little understanding of it.,1342051200,,556,4.254716981132075
