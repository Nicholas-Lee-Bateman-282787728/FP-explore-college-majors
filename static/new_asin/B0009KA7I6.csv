8062429,5,B0009KA7I6,"Quirky film that almost never went where I thought it would.  By now, it's really an older film but it never made it on to my radar until I stumbled across it by reading the reviews of an Amazon customer who seemed to have the same taste as moi!",1420588800,,245,4.0
8062430,4,B0009KA7I6,"It is a good movie.  Interestingly, all the music in it was written and performed by BOBBY VEE.",1408147200,,95,4.277777777777778
8062431,5,B0009KA7I6,"I can't even describe how good this movie is. All the characters had so many layers. It was well written with amazing acting as well.
I wish everyone could see this film and I wish it had a wide release. I will continue to follow the director and the actors and see what's next for them..",1349136000,,288,4.160714285714286

8062433,4,B0009KA7I6,"It is a rare thing when an independent film can be made with such a believable cast that you find yourself completely engulfed in watching it.

The director, who is also one of the main actors, immediately gets you interested in where the people and the story are going, and doesn't let up ever.  It was only the ending scenes I found a little disappointing, but I guess I loved the interplay between the young man and woman at the beginning so much that I wanted to see more of their interaction.  But like many European films there is no neatly wrapped up ending, which may bother some viewers.  This is a film to be appreciated for its character studies more than its A to B progression.",1124928000,5,690,4.409448818897638
8062434,5,B0009KA7I6,"This great comedy was sadly overlooked when it first hit the Festival scene in 2001.  Even with Roger Ebert behind it, it failed to secure a distribution deal, though it had great success on the Festival circuit, winning several awards.  Now that it's available on video, don't wait to see this film that's sure to gain a devoted following.  The humor is subtle and smart, and the performances are all great.  It's impossible to tell why distributors didn't pick this one up.  It's one of the better American indie films of the decade, and certainly one of the best indie comedies.",1123545600,2,581,4.712871287128713
8062435,5,B0009KA7I6,"I saw this film at the Los Angeles Film Festival a couple years ago.  I was shocked it took so long to find distribution.  It is a classic American story, weird in all the right ways.  Emotional tension, amazing acting, assured direction, beautiful cinematography... funny, sweet, heartbreaking, honest and moving.

It's best not to know too much about the plot.  It is impossible to predict where where the film is going to take you next, but it fulfills Aristotle's demand that the events in good story-telling must be both surprising and inevitable.

Take a chance on this one.",1119657600,7,580,4.86734693877551
8062436,5,B0009KA7I6,"I was lucky enough to see this movie at Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival a few years ago.  My friends and I absolutely loved it, and over the last few years, I have often wondered why it never found a distributor.  I couldn't imagine how it was possible that such a wonderful film could be kept from audiences, both theatrically and on DVD.  I was beginning to lose hope, but I happened to check the internet movie database (imdb.com) and noticed a DVD release date, which I confirmed on Amazon; needless to say I am overjoyed.  I am going to recommend this movie to so many people it's ridiculous.

The nice thing about seeing it at the festival was that I got to meet Michael Gilio, the director and star of ""Kwik Stop,"" as well as the film's producer.  I am thrilled that they are finally going to have a chance to show their movie to the world.  Hopefully the word-of-mouth will give it legs on DVD.

This movie is proof that great films can fall through the cracks; it should be high on the list of the Greatest Movies You've Never Seen.",1117238400,6,1048,4.393782383419689
