8059957,5,B0009F4YY4,The best part of this DVD set are the pictures and films about the Grand Canyon. They are very well shot and give a great view of the majesty of nature's beauty.  There are also some great clips about the navajo indians and a nice overview of the landscape of the west. It's good travel stuff.,1153699200,,293,4.232142857142857
8059958,5,B0009F4YY4,"Documentaries come and go and obviously some are better than others. This collection has five different documentaries in it, all of them relating one way or another to the American West.

While most of them are good, but not exceptional, the one about the lives of Native Americans on reservations is phenominal and worth the price of the set on its own.

You get a really good sense of just how taken advantage of these people were, and how they fought to preserve their heritage and dignity in the face of incredible odds.

The piece is very well balanced and shows you both sides of the story, which is rare in movies about this subject matter.",1146873600,2,647,4.560344827586207
