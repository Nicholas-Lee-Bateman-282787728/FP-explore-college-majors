8497397,5,B006G2FTXO,"Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were pioneers and trailblazers, and I am deeply grateful to them for their efforts and their commitment. I read ""Lesbian Woman"" back in the 70's, along with many of the other ""classics"" of the women's movement, and I remember reading many articles they wrote for ""Ms"" and other publications. But it wasn't till many years later that I learned about the struggle for LGBT rights back in the 50's and 60's.

What was most extraordinary about these two extraordinary women was their willingness to stand up and stand out, at a time when it was so much safer to remain in the shadows. Otherwise, they were just two ordinary people who loved each other and wanted a life together. And look how much hard work and courage it took for them to have such a life, which the majority take for granted. We must never take it for granted, but speak up to make sure that the rights we all enjoy are rights we actually do *ALL* enjoy.",1494633600,6,947,4.473988439306359

8497399,5,B006G2FTXO,If we do not learn from our history we are doomed to repeat it.  It is import to realize just how far we have come and just how far we still have to go.,1483833600,4,152,3.4705882352941178
8497400,4,B006G2FTXO,Interesting movie of the lesbian movement for recognition from the 1950s to 2000.  Movers and shakers who refused to remain in the closet while working within the system to improve their lives and all other lesbians. Interesting insight for those who may not have been directly involved in the times and activities. Much of it is told as first person experience with its possible slight distortions for first person memories.,1482796800,2,425,5.071428571428571
8497401,5,B006G2FTXO,"The history and part of the continuing struggle of being gay.  We all become part of the issues now we just need to step up like these women and work on solutions.

8497403,5,B006G2FTXO,Great doc on the LGBT movement.  Highly recommend.  Fills out a part of American History that's not in the books.,1458777600,,113,4.6
8497404,5,B006G2FTXO,These women were true pioneers.  I love their interviews in the film and especially their calm demeanor in the face of what seemed to be 'the end'.  What a wonderful film to relay their important story.  Excellently done!  Love this movie!,1433203200,,239,4.7560975609756095
8497405,4,B006G2FTXO,"This is a fascinating and informative film, a documentary made personal and affective by linking the emergence of lesbian rights in America to one funny, charming, and very human couple. If we posit that there must be at least as many females as males with same sex affections and lifestyles, we have to wonder why gay men have far more visibility in film (and other mediums and social circumstances) than lesbians. Comparatively, while a new social sun shines on gay men, the 21st Century is still pretty murky for our Sapphic sisters. No Secret Anymore is a solid step for those women as they move toward being no secret anymore.",1420934400,3,631,4.745454545454545
