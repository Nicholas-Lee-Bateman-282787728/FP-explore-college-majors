7834796,4,6302999618,"I have seen this movie several times in the distant past. Its a bit dated, yet has lost none of the interest of a reputable middle-aged man getting involved with a teenaged girl. For me, the only negative was that the actress playing a 14-year-old girl was clearly not 14, and so I was never sold on that part of the story. But if one just focuses on the fact that she was under age, then the movie is worth watching.....more than once.",1379289600,,436,4.265060240963855
