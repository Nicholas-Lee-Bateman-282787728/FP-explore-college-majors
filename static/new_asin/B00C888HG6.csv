5697041,4,B00C888HG6,"Sagal's present day exam of our Constitution, via  a road trip,  is very interesting and well done. I recommend it for anyone who wants a fresh, realistic view of what governs us.",1377734400,2,179,4.5625
5697042,4,B00C888HG6,"I love Peter Sagel's quick wit and humor as host of NPR's ""Wait Wait Don't Tell Me"" but I've never seen him - until this four part, four-hour, series appeared on TV. I only caught one episode so I waited for the DVD version (which has some bonuses - more on them in a minute) and watched it this week.

Sagel embarks on a journey across America in a patrioticall-painted Harley-Davidson motorcycle (a la the guys in ""Easy Rider"") - and even to Reyklavik, Iceland (without the cycle!) to explore how the U.S. Constitution, written and passed in 1787 has changed and works in the 21st century. He interviews historians as well as Americans who have been profoundly affected by the document. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect. We learn about civil rights, gay rights, gun laws, and the right to vote. It's a good history lesson with some really clever remarks by Sagel.

Though I learned a lot I did feel that it became retetaive at times and four hours is a bit long to hold your attention.

The bonuses total about 25 minutes and include A behind the scenes video - even a two-minute one about the Harley - with a few extended (or deleted interviews). If you missed it on TV this is a good way to catch up. And if you are a ""Constitution"" or history junkie you'll enjoy this as well.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5697043,5,B00C888HG6,"Basically this is a road trip that Peter Segal takes across the States interviewing various scholars, lawyers, pundits and ordinary people about the relevance of the Constitution in the 21st Century.

Without being overly technical, nor dumbed-down, it really shows the role the Constitution plays in our everyday life.

Highly recommended.",1372809600,7,340,5.647058823529412

5697058,3,B00C888HG6,"Mr. Sagal, while discussing The Bill of Rights, SKIPPED AMENDMENT IX. This brief amendment is the crux of the entire Constitution; it gives final/full authority to We The People. I later understood his omission when the Amendment XIV discussion occurred. The unfortunate movement from strong sovereign states to a more centralized (and more powerful) federal Union. Mr. Sagal dubs this ""good""; I disagree. Since Amendment XIV has been pivotal in many Supreme Court cases, it's intent/reach is too vague and it should ""be studied"". Two amendments that also strengthened the federal Union (in the opposite direction of The Federalist Papers) are Amendment XVII [REPEAL immediately!] and Amendment XVI, which should be repealed in the near future. A quick understanding of The Federalist Papers can be found at (...)",1404691200,8,813,5.359375

8578635,5,B00C888HG6,"I just finished watching the four part series and Peter Sagel does an extraordinary job of explaining the Constitution from all different perspectives whether it be Marines who served in protecting our great nation or using Akhil Amar's view points as a legal scholar to truly define the depth of constitution. Is the Constitution failing us through systematic corruption of elected Congressional officials and money be taken by undisclosed sources? How is gerrymandering breaking democracy and silencing the voices of the people? Is the Constitution a document for both the majority and minority viewpoints? How can an individual who is trying to preserve the memory of his son, a fallen Marine who lost in the Supreme Court still able to win his last battle against the West Baptist Church-a fringe group who claims dead soldiers are God's curse on us, the USA, accepting homosexuality? The layout was simple and easy to follow and I really enjoyed watching this series as an introductory part of my studies trying to learn the essence of the Constitution. There are elementary lessons on civics to counter political arguments of what our political civil liberties are. However, the conclusion, is the people are the living elements of this document who will need to decipher it for themselves so positive change is made for a society progressing. It even made me order a pocket version of the Constitution from amazon!",1481155200,,1421,5.076923076923077
