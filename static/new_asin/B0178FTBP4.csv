8738304,5,B0178FTBP4,"I have driven the ""Going to the Sun"" highway.  The video follows the highway from the entrance through the mountains.  I will never drive the highway again. It is a narrow two lane road with a 1000 foot drop off on one side and a 1000 cliff rising on the other side.  Drivers approaching from the other lane tend to crowd the white line.  Some drivers cross the white line.  There is no where to go to avoid them.  The choices are over the side or into the cliff.

Motor vehicles are limited to 20 foot in over all length.  I don't know whether bicycles are permitted.  I did not see any bicycles on the highway.

If you want to experience the highway, the video faithfully presents both the thrill and the terror of the road.",1450137600,4,726,4.272058823529412
