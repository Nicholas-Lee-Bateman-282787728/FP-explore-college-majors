8176847,3,B000NDECLC,"I was given this DVD by Dr. Vitale after telling him I like the volume 4 and was interested in the sales dvd.

The information in the 2 videos by Joe is great but the low quality audio and sloppy video editing is distracting and takes away from the overall quality.

The Mark Ryan track was just OK. For the first part of the track there is no background music which causes the experience to seem a little awkward.

I'm not sure what they were trying to do with Kirsten's track titled ""Selling States"". She was ""chanting"" with an echo effect for the first few minutes of the video again with very poor audio. The pace of this the video is also really strange. She will be telling a story and then there will be a several second pause then the story would pick up again. The video ends with the same mumbling, echo track from the beginning.

Overall you can see there was a pretty large improvement from this volume to the 4th ""wealth"" Dvd.

I would go with 2 stars but I do like the messages from Dr. Vitales sections and now I just watch those.",1331596800,,1045,4.257575757575758
8176848,3,B000NDECLC,This was an experiment in the new age thinking of getting wealth. I had good luck with self hypnosis when I was younger so I figured why not. I watched the video several times and it did improve my outlook on life. I did not get rich but found it helpful to keep my mind in a positive frame.  Hey it was worth a try.  I found the subject material to be much like the Secret or the older work by Napoleon Hill.,1275436800,,409,3.9156626506024095
