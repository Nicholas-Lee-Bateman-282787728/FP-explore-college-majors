545819,4,6303072585,"Stewart Grainger did not make many westerns but the ones he did make were good. Nicely matched against Rhonda Fleming the story is about the problems with cattle drives. Fine western photography and Burl Ives singing a song in the opening credits.

545820,4,6303072585,"Stewart Granger was in a number of action films, and he's best known for being in adventure films like King Solomon's Mines, or swashbucklers like The Prisoner of Zenda and Scaramouche.

But Granger also made several Westerns. One of the better ones was Gun Glory, which took a standard ""Gunfighter helps protect farmers from, rich, evil rancher,"" and helps it become interesting. Granger plays a gunfighter who's tired of having to live up to his reputation, and comes home to settle down with his wife and son. He finds his wife dead, and his son sullen and resentful. Rhonda Fleming stars as a housekeeper who comes to stay with Granger and his son.

A wealthy rancher, played by James Gregory, plans to stampede his cattle through Granger's and his neighboring farmers' land. Granger tries the peaceful route, but of course, it does not work, and Granger and Gregory head for a showdown.

Gun Glory isn't original or the best of it's genre, but it's well done and more than good enough to warrant a viewer's time.",1162598400,7,1017,4.767045454545454

7836057,4,6303072585,"The main plot and the subplots have all been done before, but the film was still enjoyable. Even though, accustomed to watching westerns, we could figure out the ending, it still held my interest. The principle plot is an ex-gunfighter who left his wife and son and went looking for adventure. He returns to his small town and his ranch. Among other subplots: the people in town do not think much of him because he left his family and because he killed people. There is Rhonda Fleming, looking beautiful, being mistreated by the man who raised her, a man who wants to marry her, but he mistreats her. She decides to go work for the ex-gunfighter. This angers this man who expresses his anger against the ex-gunfighter. There is this man's son who hates him for leaving his mom. There is a cattle owner of close to 20,000 cattle who want to run the cattle through the little town, an act that will destroy the town. There is the town people who foolishly think that the ex-gunfighter cannot help them and think they, although farmers, can stand up against the cattle man and his hired guns. And there is the preacher who leads the farmers who finally understands that ""Sometimes you can't ask God to do everything.""",1508976000,,1214,4.599078341013825

7836060,4,6303072585,"This is a low budget film no doubt.  I can see why Stewart Granger was complaining about it. It looked as if the houses and the town were props.  I know this was supposed to be a bunch of people building a new town, but still the buildings and the village looked fake.  But watching it today I can say it is a classic.  Photography is very good. The landscapes are beautiful.  Stewart Granger and Rhonda Fleming are both great (they look  very good together ) and I think it is thanks to them and their very solid performances that it is pleasant to watch the film.  And  believe me I found it very pleasant.  I didn't like at all the actor who played Tom Early's son but everyone else was very good.  I liked it a lot",1375833600,2,718,4.13768115942029

7836063,1,6303072585,This is undoubtedly a terrible movie but I purchased it because it was filmed outside the small town where I grew up.  I was in high school at the time and all the movie stars stayed in town and it was quite exciting.  The scenery is familiar and brings back memories.  That is why I purchased the film.,1357257600,,303,4.189655172413793
7836064,4,6303072585,"Stewart Granger and Rhonda Fleming in a good, old fashioned western.  The hero is misunderstood, a gunfighter trying to give up his guns, but he still gets the girl.  What's not to like.",1357257600,4,186,4.606060606060606
