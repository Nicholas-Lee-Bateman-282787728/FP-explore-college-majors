1348258,5,B00004ST9P,"She is a great Diva!
I've enjoyed video & music both, especially the sound is excellent. You will also love it,too.",959731200,2,115,4.523809523809524
1348259,5,B00004ST9P,"I really enjoyed this video collection.  It's kicked off with all four videos from Whitney's first album: ""You Give Good Love"", ""Saving All My Love For You"", ""How Will I Know"" and  ""Greatest Love of All"" which Whitney calls her favorite video.  Whitney calls this video collection ""the process of her growth""  where ""this girl becomes a woman"". The next set includes videos  from her second album: ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"",  ""Didn't We Almost Have It All"" (my personal favorite video!),  ""So Emotional"" and ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" which  Whitney says she didn't even want to record but finally did after urging  from Clive Davis.  Good thing she did for it went on to be her 7th #1  single. Next comes a Grammy performance of ""One Moment In Time""  and her unforgettable performance of ""The Star Spangled Banner"".  From her third album she just includes the videos for ""I'm Your Baby  Tonight"" and ""All The Man That I Need"". Next comes some  soundtrack videos.  The only video from The Bodyguard is ""I Will  Always Love You"" and the only video from The Preachers Wife is  ""Step By Step"".  No videos from Waiting To Exhale are on here.  Finally she ends the collection with all the videos from her final album:  ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"",  ""My Love Is Your Love"" and ""I Learned From The Best"".  All in all, it's money well worth spending to get all of these great videos  in one place.  Most of these videos hardly ever air on the music video  channels anymore so it was great fun to see them again.  You get 18 videos  on this collection and you'll enjoy every one of them!",959212800,84,1606,4.540350877192982
1348260,4,B00004ST9P,"This video is ok.  I am a really deep fan of Whitney. I have alot of her items, but where are all the other videos? Like, Run to You, I Have Nothing, Exhale, I Believe in You and Me, I'm Every Woman, Why Does It Hurt So Bad. And the other videos not on the greatest hits cd, like, My Name is  not Susan, Miracle, Count on Me, the real One Moment in Time video, and  maybe others.  I know that these videos were made, because i seen them a  while back.  i think it's time to complain to ARISTA, because these  videos should have been on this video.  Especially for the price.  And  also why in the ... do they add the special bonuses to the DVD disc.  Just  because we buy the vhs versions doesn't mean we don't want to see the  extras!",958608000,18,735,3.986206896551724
1348261,5,B00004ST9P,Of all the Video Collections from the Music world this is the most complete and utterly entertaining. This collection includes everything!

1348358,5,B00004ST9P,"As others have said - this is a MUST HAVE for Whitney fans.  Others have complained that alot of her videos were not included on this DVD.  While nothing from the ""I Look To You"" album is on here, nearly everything else is.  There are 25 videos in total, the only ones I can think of that are not included are ""Count On Me"", ""Miracle"", and ""My Name Is Not Susan"".  Everything you want to see is on here, including ""Exhale, Shoop Shoop"", which others said was not included (maybe some videos have been added to this DVD recently).

  I haven't even watched the bonus materials yet, but after watching all the videos in one shot, I was so delighted that I had to come on and give a good review so that all Whitney fans order this.  If you're a REAL BIG Whitney fan like I am, you'll like it just because of the couple of pictures of Whitney inside the DVD case, and the ""Interactive"" Whitney that welcomes you when the DVD starts.  Nice to see some new material/pics/interviews of Whitney, I just can't get enough of the gone-far-too-soon Whitney.

  Also, please note that many of the reviews that are on here talk about all the songs being remixed - that must only be the CD version, for some reason they are reviewing they CD version on the DVD product site.

They have NOT been ripped from YouTube, which in my opinion, is a big plus.  I hope Sony/BMG will release a second DVD that will include the 3 or 4

I'm still watching the DVD so I haven't gotten through it entirely however, I need to give compliments for the concert version of Didn't We Almost Have It All. PHENOMENAL performance! Whitney gave her all on that stage! Although I was a fan, I was too young to really attend her performances then so I definitely appreciate the art of film making. The filming and recording is fabulous!  If you are a lover of vocals, wonderful writing of lyrics we won't EVER get again in this lifetime (i.e. Diane Warren and all the fabulous others), music that fills you inside when you play it loud enough, and the wonderful talent that came through Whitney, YOU WILL WANT THIS DVD.

Last summer my little girl and I were playing the WII American Idol singing game and we were competing against each other and we picked Whitney Houston's song and after we finished the song, I said I should have known better than to pick a Whitney song! We did okay per the game, my little girl won!

Lyrics to Whitney's best songs, Impossible from the Disney movie Roger and Hammerstein's Cinderella, The star spangled banner, More Whitney's performances.. Concert for A new South Africa, Live from the Grammy Awards etc! This DVD has so much to offer!

I grew up watching Whitney Houston though out the years and I am proud to own her collection. As we viewed this collection I could remember seeing the Video's when they first came out. This is so magical to me... And when ever Whitney Houston performed movies, videos, CD's for me she was so magical!! Feelings of joy and warmth!  We will always miss Whitney Houston! Thank you Lord for the time you allowed us to have with Whitney Houston..

You will not be disappointed with this collection!

Enjoy! We sure are! watching over and over! We would love to see this as a Wii, Xbox, Play station singing game like the Michael Jackson dance game. We sure would buy it and I am sure many others would to.. This is one sure way to continue to sing with Whitney Houston!

From the Bodyguard album: 'I Have Nothing', 'I'm Every Woman', 'Queen of The Night' (Radio Edit) and 'I Will Always Love You' (original on Disc 1, remix on Disk 2). From the My Love is Your Love album: 'It's Not Right But It's Okay', 'My Love Is Your Love', 'Heartbreak Hotel' and 'I Learned From the Best'. From the Preacher's Wife: 'Step By Step'. From Whitney: 'Love Will Save the Day', 'So Emotional' and 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'. From I'm Your Baby Tonight: 'I'm Your Baby Tonight'. And finally, from Whitney Houston: 'How Will I Know' and 'Greatest Love of ALL'.

'Fine' and 'Could I Have This Kiss Forever' don't exist in their original form anywhere that I could find where I could download it legally.

As for Disc 1, 'If You Say I Have Nothing' from the Bodyguard was the only one I could find of the remix's in original form.

I wish that Amazon and iTunes would press the recording companies for the ability and right to make original hits available to their customers, make it known that there is/are remixes for a song and let the customer decide which version they wish to purchase. Many, many songs that have been recorded are no longer available in any form, though many were mastered from their original vinyl albums to CD and in some cases into MP3.

We, the public, are the ultimate loosers. My guess is that even what I've been able to accomplish, to get as many of the original hits as possible, may become somewhat unavailable soon. It is very sad!!!",1329609600,,1545,4.468085106382978

1348393,5,B00004ST9P,"I just bought this a year ago to replace my missing VCD counterpart and I was so shocked and saddened to hear that Whitney Houston had died suddenly in her hotel room.

Whitney was the VOICE. She was such a joy to listen to and always had such a bright smile to bring cheer to your day.

This is her only video collection. There's another one with a different cover (cover shot of The Ultimate Collection CD) but the contents are identical.

Most of her videos are here. Bonus features includes some live performances such as the Grammy's One Moment In Time and MTV's Why Does It Hurt So Bad? I don't know if there are clips for All At Once, Love Will Save The Day and Miracle. If so, Sony could put out a full collection soon. Do include Exhale.

This is a great collection to remember Whitney Houston by. I just can't believe she's gone. May her music legacy live on forever. Whitney, you will always have a special place in my heart. You are the greatest voice of all!

PS: I recently chanced upon the US edition. Compared to the international version reviewed above, the US release contains the videos for Exhale and I Believe In You And Me. Also included is the US version of I'm Your Baby Tonight. The song is a different from the international dance version.

I love it so much that I bought a copy from the local music store right after renting it.

1348413,5,B00004ST9P,"This DVD is a collection of MTV style music videos, live performances, and selected additional material including interviews and ""making of"" segments.  It is a DVD you can watch over and over.  I see and hear something new every time I watch it.

Whitney Houston has never been a great stage performer, but her voice and her music are powerful, soulful and personal.  Her music has seemed to reflect her personal life in ways which are sometime haunting, sometimes tinged with sadness, but always beautiful.  ""Its Not Right But Its OK"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""I Will Always Love You"" hold such deeply intense meaning for this performer.  Perhaps her success stems from the fact that she can bring such emotion to the songs she chooses.  American Idol contestants and other wannabees...take note!

Given her recent personal difficulties, the music takes on an even more intensely personal tone.  When I watch the live performance of ""Didn't We Almost Have it All?"" she I have the sense that she is speaking to someone who isn't in the audience.  You wonder if she was aware that she was perhaps foreshadowing events in her life.  In ""Step By Step"", she goes back to her gospel roots and gives a great performance.

The segments on this DVD sample the range of music...from pop to R&B to gospel...that Whitney Houston has masterfully navigated through her career.

I hope one day she will share her voice with us again and perform many of these songs that may have deeper meaning for her...and us...now more than ever.",1116892800,4,1514,4.821705426356589

1348416,5,B00004ST9P,"I received this DVD as a Christmas present and let me tell you, it is excellent. There are so many videos that Whitney has made over the years as an artist. And when you first view the DVD, there's a short intro made by Whitney herself, as well as a fun and interactive menu of what you want to watch. I enjoyed the interviews of Whitney and Clive Davis. One thing that made me laugh is seeing all of her old videos that she made in the 80's. It's amazing to see how much the style of pop music has changed. To sum up, this DVD is rich with Whitney material that won't put you down at all.",1085961600,6,589,4.0
1348417,5,B00004ST9P,"I bought this DVD last year, I thouroughly enjoy it- Whitney speaks on it, and it has tons of videos I 've never seen.

1348418,4,B00004ST9P,"This is a great DVD! But I must admit some of her oldest videos looked a little silly right now! But hte muzik iz good! She's got the voice and the talent! The worst thing about this DVS iz that some videos are missing: ""Shoop Song"", ""Something In Common"", ""When You Believe"", ""It's Not Right But It's Okay (thunderpuss remix)"", ""Could I Have This Kiss Forever"", ""If I Told You That"", ""Watchulookinat"", ""One Of Those Days"" and ""Try It On My Own""...

1348420,5,B00004ST9P,"The absolute best Whitney offering there is...period. Though it was distributed before Fine and If I Told You That, this DVD is still the $h*t. Though Whitney may have picked some bad wigs to rock, she still looks beautiful and sound wonderful. She may not be able to SANG anymore, but the woman still can SING her clothes off.",1061424000,2,327,4.559322033898305
1348421,5,B00004ST9P,"These performances, like Home, Didn't We..., etc., are priceless.  This was, by far, my most prized DVD of 2001.  Whitney just isn't saangin' like this anymore.  I love it.",1051056000,,172,4.862068965517241
1348422,4,B00004ST9P,"This DVD chronicles Whitney's career to innocent, pure-voiced ingenue to slick modern superstar with a penchant for being in the tabloids.
It opens up with the excellent ""You Give Good Love"" and through the songs presented here you can watch Whitney grow up. You can also see her star status rise to new heights as Whitney becomes a movie star with ""The Bodyguard"". There are definity shifts in her fame and style, and these can be witnessed here. For example, the first shift is felt upon hearing (and seeing) the first few bars of ""I'm Your Baby Tonight""... But then the musical risks and independent style she was taking with ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" are superseded by her mega success with ""The Bodyguard"", where she shouts full-blown corporate love songs.
There's a whole lot of slick urbane songs and videos here, Whitney has not always been musically adventurous, but there are interesting songs here and there, nearly all dealing with affairs of the heart and their ensuing complications. We see that her fame has heavily relied on the power of her clear, steely voice.
The best Special Feature is Whitney's first live TV performance of ""Home"" on The Merv Griffin Show. It shows a side of Whitney rarely seen- nervous, naive, unaware of her future, yet a genuine revelation to those watching- Merv introduces an young unknown and after the performance knows that he has just introduced a superstar...Her voice is in perfect form here, singing an exceptional song in an exceptional performance.
Other great live performances include ""Didn't We Almost Have it All"", ""One Moment in Time"" at the Grammys and ""Why Does it Hurt So Bad?"", the latter a fine performance though Whitney's voice is a bit rough and she sweats profusely. There are other performances included, though they are not career-defining or her best. Missing are many other great live performances e.g. ""Saving All My Love For You"" from the Grammys, ""Greatest Love of All"" in New York and many others.
There is also an interview with Whitney and her then-record company honcho, Clive Davis. Plus an extended photo shoot session featuring Clive. Who knew that this DVD also marked the end of her working relationship with Clive. So basically, these are the Clive Years. It chronicles their achievements and illustrates Clive's influence on her music.",1046995200,,2319,4.96401028277635
1348423,4,B00004ST9P,"I can't believe I have waited so long to purchase this DVD. As  i child of the '80s, I grew up on Whitney's music, and I am glad that I now have the opportunity to revisit these classics! She has an AMAZING voice.
  The video itself is superb! It offers up rare Whitney performances from the 80's, as well as behind the scenes commentary from fellow soul divas Faith Evans, Missy, Kelly Price and others. It even shows a side of Whitney which is not often seen: for instance, Whitney clowning around at a photo shoot while singing Faith Evans' ""All Night Long""! The DVD packs all of these things, plus all of her best videos into one tiny package. This is truly one of the best music DVDs that I have purchased. BUY IT!",1033084800,,719,4.311111111111111
1348424,5,B00004ST9P,"If you are a Whitney fan, hell, even if you're not a Whitney fan, this is an INCREDIBLE DVD showing the world what a real voice is.  Everyone else pales compare to her in voice quality, you can say whatever you want about her as a person but Whitney's voice is a universal treasure that matches her beauty.  You will go through memories of the 80s and 90s, her movies, other celebrities, and it is incredible.",1027123200,,409,4.368421052631579
1348425,4,B00004ST9P,"There is no denying the music of Whitney Houston. Her strength in R&B is still as strong as it was back when she started in the mid 1980's, and that remains to be true.
Her 2000 DVD, The Greatest Hits, showcases the many talents this legandary Diva has made. While some of the videos reamin as simple, like You Give Good Love, and The Greatest Love Of All, and some reflect Mrs. Bobby Brown as a hard cookie, like Queen Of The Night, and I Learned From The Best.
Surprisingly, there are two different versions of the DVD anthology of Whitney Houston's videos. Some of them carry two extra music videos, Exhale (Shoop Shoop), from Waiting To Exhale, and I Believe In You And Me, from The Preacher's Wife.
While her music may have fizzled down in the industry, Whitney Houston still shows that she is still a survivor among the so-called corporate teen idol crowd of Nsync, and Britney Spears fans. No wonder Whitney Houston has still learned to be the best.",1021680000,4,956,4.531791907514451

1348427,5,B00004ST9P,"For the last 10 years, I've had a love/hate relationship with Whitney: sometimes I like her, and sometimes I don't.  Regardless, anyone interested in pop music should check out this video collection of Whitney's hits.  Some of the selections are dated (check out the killer weave in ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"") while others are tastefully done (""You Give Good Love,"" ""I Learned From the Best,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel"").  This set also has lyrics to all the songs, concert footage, and a neat backstage trip to a promotional photo shoot.  Unlike other music DVDs, this one doesn't skimp on the extras, and there's enough bonus material to make Whitney fans and casual listeners like myself interested.",1008115200,41,698,5.043478260869565
1348428,5,B00004ST9P,"When I heard this DVD was going to be released I was estatic. Almost every video done by Whiney Houston is included, from the early videos such as ""How Will I Know"" and ""The Greatest Love Of All"" through the Bodyguard era hits like ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""I'm Every Woman"" to her recent smash hits such as ""My Love Is Your Love"" and ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"".
But to me what makes it so special are the extras, such as live performances at the Grammy Awards, in concert in South Africa, her performance of the Star Spangled Banner, and her first performance on the Merv Griffin show.
Also included are interviews with Whitney, Clive Davis, Missy  Elliot, Wyclef Jean, Diane Warren, and others.
A must have for any Whitney fan or any other person from the MTV generation who has been touched by Whitney's music.",1002153600,165,821,4.473333333333334
1348429,5,B00004ST9P,"Whitney hasn't exactly been an angel these past few years. Strange marriage, erratic behavior, drugs.. etc.. makes you forget about the thing that's most important in her public life - The Voice. Ah, the voice is in fine shape. This is one of the best music DVD's I've purchased - loaded with extras, live performances, and her lengthy list of videos. The debut TV performance on Merv Griffin, the Star Spangled Banner, the absolutely electrifying performance of ""One Moment in Time"" from the Grammy's - all of these are included as bonuses to compliment her rather diverse range of music videos. It's easy to get caught up in the public gabfest about Whitney's personal life, but this look back at her highly successful career is a reminder that Whitney was (and still is) one of the most powerful voices in pop music. Here's to hoping that $100 million contract with Arista produces more of the same.",998697600,,902,4.788461538461538
1348430,5,B00004ST9P,"This DVDis the most complete and enjoyable I own. You get Whitney's classic videos, plus special performances, 2 great interviews and the photosession of the cover (which I didn't particullary like. It was too long and they could save the space for another video or performance).
The videos I like the most are ""You give good love"", ""How will I know"", ""I wanna dance with sb"", ""Where do broken hearts go"", Exhale"", ""Run to you"", ""It's not right but it's ok"" and ""I learned from the best"". The rest of the videos are also great, though, as well as the special performances.
I think the record company could have waited a little longer to release this DVD, in order to include the videos of the new tracks, like ""Fine"", ""If I told you that"" and ""Could I have this kiss forever"", and I really missed ""When you believe"", but every time I see this DVD I have a good time, and I think it's totally worth the money.
By the way, my copy ..., didn't include the ""I learned from the best"" single, but that's fine, and I didn't have problems in the end of track 14, which was GREAT",992390400,3,1070,4.355

As for the DVD extras I didn't find it to be all that...

Everything from You Give Good Love to I Learned From The Best, with the exception of the inexcused absences of Run To You, I Believe In You And Me, Exhale, I Have Nothing, Im Every Woman, etc, which I find puzzling because they are on the cd but not here, I wonder why? I really think its stupid that Arista advertises this as 'every single Whitney Houston video is included' when they arent. Despite that its a good collection to have, as long as you don't mind missing those other songs. And whats with the DVD having extra stuff, some of us cant afford DVD players.

Surely, some of her videos are missing in this release --Shoop, Shoop song, It's not right (dance version) etc. The special area is very interesting, showing live performances of Whitney and exclusive interviews.

However, it is clear that Arista have rushed  out this DVD out with no real understanding of what tracks Whitney's fans  rate as their greatest hits.  The big question for me, is, where are the  videos for  Exhale (shoop shoop, Hurt so Bad and Count on Me? To do a diva  such as Whitney and her fans true justice, it should have been a 2 disc  set, which should have included ALL the videos to ALL her single releases  and any unseen videos, which might not have been released in addition to  extra footage on this DVD, now that  would have kept me and many others  happy! The only thing, I can say is that Arista have made a real hash of  it, showing no real understanding of her worldwide fan base and also a lack  of respect towards a superb diva, who is  simply the best (as her record  sales would indicate).  The only saving grace was that there was none of  those horrendous DJ mixes on the  DVD, as there is on the Greatest Hits CD!
