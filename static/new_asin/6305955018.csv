1101779,5,6305955018,"This film greatly exagerates the power and influence of the neo-nazi movement in modern germany, but if you ignore that it does have the elements of a great film. It attempts to focus on the family situations of a couple of disenfranchised teens who fall in with neo-nazis. The relationships between the charectors and the charector development make the film interesting. The most moving aspect of the film for me, is the tragic death of it's star Nikolas Vogel, a few years later while he was serving as a reporter during the war in Slovenia. While the film at times seems exploitive and pandering (sex, nudity), at least it's doomed star was someone who wanted to make a difference with their life, and this film is part of his legacy.
I am slightly disapointed that this dvd was made from a print of the film with the english subtitles, and not a better, more original print. This is basically the same as the old american VHS version of the film, just on dvd.",1184457600,36,963,4.572254335260116
1101780,4,6305955018,"This is a fantastic, and disturbing film, dealing with the attraction of fascist neo-Nazis. Watch as a normal teenager is drawn to an emerging Neo-Nazi group, see how the group splinters into separate political and military groups, and discover how education is our best defense against the allowing this to happen. This is a modern, and much over-looked classic. It's German Language and subtitled, and very blunt (realistic) in it's approach, straight down to it's tragic, abrupt conclusion.
I'm hoping that this will soon be released on DVD, and receive a wider audience. I first discovered it about twenty years ago when it first came out on video.
A must for anyone interested in the sociological intrigue such fascist groups possess. Buy it today.",1061337600,7,753,5.080645161290323
1101781,3,6305955018,"I was certainly ambivalent about this movie.  First of all, I may have enjoyed this movie a lot more if it hadn't been dubbed.  It was dubbed very poorly, and that was a major distraction throughout the film.  The characterization was spotty, and at times the motivations for certain actions eluded me.  On the other hand, it presented a multilayered perspective on the different dimensions of the neo-nazi movement in Germany.  It was interesting to see the way the various factions interacted with each other.  I was also shocked to see sexual material of a very graphic nature in this film.  These scenes are such that they would probably be unthinkable in an American production dealing with similar subject matter. It's an interesting juxtaposition to see sex presented alongside hate groups.  Please be aware that this movie is not of the afterschool special variety and is really not suitable for children, or History class.",1024358400,2,931,5.0

7898615,4,6305955018,"This film from 1983 tells the story of Thomas (Nikolas Vogel) who comes from a good background but a home life that is marred by his over ambitious and some would say martinet like mother. He seems to be in a cycle of fighting all the time; at school he starts failing in his grades  adding to the home life grief.

Then he discovers right wing politics and all of a sudden he has a purpose in life. This exposes him to ideals of inclusiveness that only exist to exclude others. There is a lot of growing up and coming of age too and a fair amount of eroticism or at least sexual tension. There is a quote which sort of explains his motivation  your heart has to break for the right ideals.

This is a film that is unpretentious in what it wants to do and just sets out its stall; we have holocaust deniers here too. It is a well acted and made film but the quality of the print is a bit transfer  from video feel to it; but once I got used to that I hardly noticed it. This is a film for people who like films to make you think, be a bit provocative and just that bit left of left field  recommended.",1445990400,,1101,4.027522935779817

7898617,5,6305955018,"Of the late twentieth century eighties work shows straightening renaissance of Nazi movement narrowing it to a local folksdeutsch-es' dissatisfaction with then Austria.

A story is of the youngsters fighting their teen problems by finding a self-realisation in sex and society through participating in neo-fascist activities arranged and manipulated by Hitler-era devoted soldiers survived.

Eventually, some of the grown up teens screened did make it into power halls as the most recent elections in the EU-participating Austria demonstrated really.

Highly recommended.",1268870400,,571,6.0246913580246915
7898618,3,6305955018,This is a great film about the German Hitler Youth and what they did. I would recommend this film to High School students as a study in German History.,1264204800,,151,4.241379310344827
7898619,5,6305955018,"This film shows the power of the neo-nazi movement in Germany following the second World War. It does so very well. You will enjoy this film, especially if you are educated on pre WWII German sociology and psychology (basic 20th century european history really).

Disenfranchised kids are lured into the Neo-Nazi underground and the drama, action, adventure that follows is gripping. The main character is strong and his story line is wonderfully constructed. The sex and nudity is probably overdone, and the drama sometimes too strong, but the positive characteristics of the film well overcome the few negative ones.

7898621,4,6305955018,"Every society seems to have a difficult impasse with its young, as they struggle to become SOMEBODY other than someone's kid. In Germany - as well as in some other lands - the rebelliousness too often opens the door just a crack to the horrors of the Nazi era, and this movie treats us to a depressing but ocassionally riveting glimpse through the window. Sired by a dolt, foaled by an oppressed dullard, our protagonist wends the corridors of a neo-nazi youth group used as a poltical tool (and pawn). If you're able to follow in German, the movie is more telling than the subtitles convey - but no subtitles have ever translated a film to perfection. The quality of the image is awful - as if the DVD was a Chinese pirated edition. A worthy effort by director and cast, but once viewed it will gather dust in a library, so if see it you will, rent before you buy. Whatever happened to the 25-cent matinee ?",1232841600,,908,4.410714285714286
7898622,5,6305955018,"Our political leaders should view this film so the lessons of the past don't come to haunt us in the future. What do you get when you outsource jobs, move manufacturing overseas, and illegal immigrants take jobs in your country? No future for the young who became easy recruits for terrorists.
This film does an excellent job of portraying what happened during the Nazi era in Germany and is happening in the present era. The youth movement was the backbone of their ambitious goal of seizing power in the government and expanding their agenda into other nations. If we don't pay attention, this could happen to us.",1206316800,13,615,4.757009345794392
