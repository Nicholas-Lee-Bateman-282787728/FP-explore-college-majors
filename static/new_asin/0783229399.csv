71468,4,0783229399,"I remember seeing this movie at the cinema back when I was a pre-teen.  I think it was probably the first film I saw with 'surround sound' or whatever the latest gimmick was.  I thought it was great and sitting in the cinema, I felt just like I was on the rollercoaster. Watching it on the tv screen at home is unlikely to be anywhere near as great as the original experience so I think I'll stick with my memories.  I don't think the story was that clever, so if I were you I'd wait for a special movie event at your local cinema and go see it there - the DVD or video is likely to be disappointing no matter how big your tv screen is.",985219200,,636,3.9921259842519685
71469,5,0783229399,"1977's ROLLERCOASTER was written by the team (Richard Levinson and William Link) responsible for many of the best COLUMBO episodes on TV. This film relies on subtle, well-plotted suspense and humor to hook you, and it  works. The characters are for the most part enjoyably cynical and grouchy,  and the interplay between George Segal and Richard Widmark is especially  fun. Look for a very young Helen Hunt as Segal's daughter -- and an early  walk-on by one of the stars of DINER. See if you find and similarities in  the phone conversations between Segal's character and Timothy Bottoms'  character here, and the conversations between Clint Eastwood's character  and John Malkovich's character in IN THE LINE OF FIRE.
If you have the  patience to enjoy an old-fashioned thriller that doesn't bash you over the  head with attention-deficit-disorder-paced editing a la Michael Bay or  Simon West, check it out.",955411200,5,910,5.129251700680272

The suspense is great, the soundtrack is cheesy fairground - which is  great and it just personifies the 70's to me. I'd love to ride some of the  coasters in the film, but living in the UK makes it hard! If you love  cheesy 70's thrillers such as Earthquake, Towering Inferno, etc. then this  is another ""must see"" for you.",953510400,3,471,4.379310344827586

71493,4,0783229399,"BLU-RAY REVIEW
The transfer to Blu Ray is really well done and the original aspect ratio is maintained, unlike the DVD.  (Perhaps the transfer engineer deserves a letter of commendation.)  The audio is Sensurround, I got the Sensurround in a couple radio spots but didn't really hear much during the movie, not a big deal the audio is good but is 3 channel as the film is older.
I have had several version of this movie, starting at VHS, then laserdisc, DVD and now Blu-Ray.  There's a particular scene later in the movie where they show some singing mushrooms (that have to take a break so they don't get spore throats, CLASSIC).  The text on that sign has always been a hallmark to check quality, that and the brightness of some of the neon lights on the rides.  On the VHS the text isn't legible, on the laserdisc with a 35"" tube TV it was barely readable, DVD was only slightly better and the Blu-Ray is nearly perfect.  The picture has some grain, expected and appreciated that it was left as is and not processed.  The picture really does look excellent.
The ding of a star is for extras.  There are some sills, posters, some great radio spots and an interview with the writer which is worth watching once.  I know extras cost money so I don't fault Shout as this isn't exactly The Godfather but it's worth noting there's not much there (even though that could be expected.)
Really glad I got it and it's a movie you can watch on a Sunday afternoon every year or two so it's worth owning.  It's also become really hard to find anywhere, no on TV much and haven't seen it on streaming.  I really appreciate Shout putting this out, thanks much!!!",1469404800,9,1650,4.466666666666667
71494,5,0783229399,"Another (relatively) obscure flick that Shout Factory has rescued from obscurity and offered in a nice HD presentation.

The film is a variation on the 70s disaster film, this time set in several amusement parks. If you've got a vintage amusement park fetish, this film offers some cool vintage footage. Though, I'd say I wish there was more footage of the parks.

The film is a typical somewhat slow burn 70s drama; there's no way you'd find this pacing in a modern film. But one either has the patience for older films or doesn't.

There's not much in the way of bonus features (one interview mainly), but I'd imagine Shout had little budget or resources for elaborate bonus material. It's frankly a tiny miracle this thing made it out on Blu-ray.",1469404800,,749,4.702290076335878
71495,5,0783229399,"Often lumped in with the disaster films of the 1970s, Rollercoaster is actually more of a thriller. And a good one at that, especially if you are a fan of amusement parks as this was filmed at several real life locations including King's Dominion which is featured heavily in the middle of the movie. Many of the icons and rides are seen in the film, including the safari ride which I believe is no longer there.

Anyhow, George Segal stars as a safety inspector who checks the maintenance and upkeep of amusement park attractions including rollercoasters. The film opens with a tense sequence where a mysterious bomber (Timothy Bottoms) plants an explosive device on a rollercoaster and the audience watches in panic and anticipation of the detonation which results in multiple deaths on the coaster. Coincidentally this same coaster has just passed inspection by Segal's character and Segal becomes drawn into a game of cat-and-mouse with the bomber who threatens to cause further destruction unless his demands are met. The Feds led by Richard Widmark become involved and initially dismiss Segal but the bomber insists Segal be his liason between himself and the Feds.

Originally presented in SenSurround in select theaters when the film opened in 1977, Shout Factory has recreated that sensation if you have the correct audio set up in your home, otherwise the audio plays normally. But the SenSurround is amazing during the sequences filmed on board the different rollercoasters seen in the film.

As I mentioned this isn't really a disaster film as the opening sequence is the big draw of the film, the rest is a cat and mouse thriller. And it is not loaded with stars, but those present are all excellent (George Segal and Richard Widmark along with Timothy Bottoms and a young Helen Hunt as Segal's daughter. Henry Fonda also pops up in a couple scenes as Segal's unlikable boss.)

Worth checking out if you are a fan of 70s films or just want a good look at some classic amusement parks of the past. Most of these parks are still open but have been modified and refurbished several times in the nearly 40 years since this movie hit theaters.",1469232000,4,2151,4.836956521739131

71499,5,0783229399,I own this film on DVD . It had a big impact on me when I saw it theatrically in 1977 when I was fourteen . All subsequent viewings haven't diminished it's ability to mortify and rivet me . I'm delighted to see and read (DVD Drive-in!) current reviews of the picture owing to it's blu ray debut .  I gather it was one of only several films (four perhaps ?) released in Sennsurround . I didn't have the good fortune to see it that way . I did see Earthquake that way with my two older brothers though . Perhaps that's best because my brothers and I ejected ourselves from Earthquake as we grew up in California and couldn't stop laughing and cutting up during the quakes . Sorry if you were at that particular screening . I adore Earthquake now though . More than ever for both .,1467331200,,778,4.1866666666666665
71500,3,0783229399,"The picture quality is excellent. A big improvement over the DVD. I was VERY disappointed with the Sensurround process. It is nothing like the Sensurround on both Earthquake and Midway blu-rays; where you can actually feel and hear it. It is barely noticeable on here. There are slight vibrations on a few scenes and that is about it. What I did like though is that at the beginning of the film there was an announcement that the film was being presented in Sensurround and that you would feel as well as hear realistic effects. That was something that neither the Earthquake and Midway blu-rays had. When all three were in their first run showings that announcement was made at the beginning of each film. It's ironic that the blu-ray with the least effective use of the process would have that announcement. Five stars for the film quality, 1 star for the Sensurround soundtrack = 3 stars.",1467244800,2,891,4.717948717948718
71501,3,0783229399,"I was really looking forward to this Blu-Ray but was disappointed with the claim that it has a Sensurround track. After playing it last night the rumble is almost non-existent. The subwoofer was barely active. After checking my setting and verifying that my subwoofer was working, I was able to conclude that the claim of Sensurround is false.

There are two audio tracks on this disc. One is 2.1 (Left, Right, Subwoofer) Dolby TrueHD. The other is 2.0 DTS Master Audio. I made absolutely sure my audio system was set on 2.1.

Before the movie starts, the ""Warning"" is played which is really neat (the one that says ""The management assumes no responsibility for the physical or emotional reactions of the individual viewer""). That was s nice addition. The only problem is that on this Blu-Ray, the Sensurround simply isn't there.

I will say that the picture quality is great and worth the price. Just don't count on Blu-Ray shaking your room. It's just not going to happen.",1466985600,8,974,4.785714285714286
71502,4,0783229399,"I was hoping for a 5.1 remix to throw the Sensurround effect like the Universal release of ""Earthquake"".
This transfer did the rumbling without a sub.
Rollercoaster is in 3.1 and 2.0.
If you have a sub you'll get 3.1 R/L but no center so you will get the Sensurround effect.
2.0 the sound is good and a step above the original DVD mono 1.0 mono track.
If you don't have a sub be warned.
That being said, the blu ray video transfer is pristine.",1466812800,2,443,4.223529411764706
71503,4,0783229399,"So naturally I had to see this movie.  Not one of the best but extremely entertaining.

He plays a regional safety inspector named Harry Calder who gets called in after one of the coasters he recently inspected and OK,d has an ""accident"".  We come to find out that someone (a young Timothy Bottoms) is placing bombs on different attractions (mostly but not just coasters) and blackmailing the amusement parks.  Harry notices there were different ""accidents"" in different amusement parks in the area and learns that the owners of the parks are having a meeting, which he crashes.

71530,3,0783229399,"What is it with crazy criminal masterminds and their playing classical music? Rollercoaster, Universal Studios' modest 1977 hit, features one such loony (Timothy Bottoms, chilling), a mad bomber who demands (*gasp!*) one million dollars lest he keep on planting explosives at amusement parks across the nation. I couldn't help cracking up when I heard his monetary demand, visions of Austin Powers all up in my head. But to my earlier point, the movie opens on the mad bomber seated sedately on the pier, popping the cassette player to ""Movement from String Quartette (Young Man's Theme).""

Rollercoaster is part race-against-time thriller, part disaster flick. If you're into historical landmarks, the story lines up several recognizable theme parks as targets of the extortionist: Ocean View Amusement Park (in Norfolk VA), Kings Dominion (Doswell, VA), and Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA). And me having gone to Magic Mountain all my life, sure, there's that added thrill.

If not for that ransom note, the law would still be in the dark that these acts of sabotage are connected. The FBI reflects: this crafty nut's rigged two accidents 2,000 miles apart without leaving a trace, this suggesting a working knowledge of structural engineering, demolition, and electronics. But the feds aren't who the bomber picks as his one-on-one foil.

Harry Calder (George Segal) is a divorced dad and inspector from the Dept. of Standards & Safety. He gets pulled in when his disapproving, bureaucratic chief (Henry Fonda) sics him on the Ocean View Amusement Park bombing, since Calder was the last guy to inspect the place. Calder is an interesting, non-conforming cat. He's the one who suspects that these accidents weren't isolated incidents. His show of clever intrigues the bomber who promptly selects Calder as his talk piece to convey his demands. So follows the cat-and-mouse cross-country manhunt.

Props to Rollercoaster for being a modest hit in 1977, the same year that rolled out Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And ""modest"" is the key word. This isn't a grand spectacle. The special effects are modest. There isn't much action. The film rides on the ability of its actors to advance the plot and ramp up the suspense. So there's good character work done here from Segal to Bottoms to Fonda to Susan Strasberg (as Segal's patient girlfriend) to Richard Widmark (as the grizzled FBI agent) to a 14-year-old Helen Hunt who plays Segal's daughter. Rumor has it that there's a sighting of an up-and-coming Steve Guttenberg, but I sure didn't eyeball him.",1412035200,,2581,5.123515439429929

 The plot deals with a maniac who is planting bombs on various rollercoaster rides around the country and he is keeping his biggest bomb for one of the largest amusement parks in California.

 The special effects are superb (even for 1970's standards) and the action is nail-biting.

 A great Saturday afternoon movie!",1405900800,,459,4.82051282051282
71534,4,0783229399,"This 1977 thriller was considered one of the best in the 70's. It did not rely on big-time, out-of-the world, completely unbelievable special effects. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat with the strategy of imagination. It shows no blood and guts, but you know what's going to happen, and this is how the thriller defines itself.

There is tongue-and-cheek acting by George Segal, who comes across as a likable, funny, and sarcastic civil engineer. One of the rollercoasters he inspected has an accident. People are killed (it is in the beginning of the movie and probably the most graphic scene, but tame by today's standards), and Harry Caulder (Segal) must visit the amusement park and help determine what went wrong. His boss is played by Henry Fonda, who has a very short role in the film, but highly effective, even giving Harry Caulder a piece of advice we all would be wise to use.

When Harry learns another accident at an amusement park took place a couple of thousand miles away, he starts making calls. The park owners are hush-hush. No one is talking, and this arouses Caulder's suspicions. Especially when he learns the park owners are going to have a meeting in Chicago all of sudden. Harry Caulder blackmails his boss into sending him to meet them, which he does and everyone learns a mad bomber is striking the park and threatens to do more harm unless paid $1,000,000 (a sizable sum for its time). I think it's cool how back then they did not think of wire transfers into a Swiss account, but instead demanding hard cash.

Harry gives the owners of the park good advice, and the mad bomber, played by Timothy Bottoms, appreciates the compliments enough that he requests the FBI have Caulder drop the money. Caulder is made to walk through a packed amusement park while the bomber plays hide-and-seek with the FBI. Richard Widmark plays the head FBI agent and is good in his by-the-book role. This movie focuses on character and a good script. It works because it is well-written, directed, and acted. Anyone who enjoys movies will see how the movie makers of yesterday can still teach today's movie makers a lesson on how to keep the audience on the edge of their seat.",1402185600,,2197,4.686528497409326

71542,5,0783229399,"Rollercoaster (1977) is about a psycho who is detonating bombs on roller coasters and won't stop unless he is paid $1,000,000.  This movie has always been lumped into the disaster movie category, but really it's a suspense cat-and-mouse thriller.  I remember when this movie came out.  Seems like yesterday.  I only saw previews back then, but now I'm able to review this movie after having seen it.  This movie features Henry Fonda in a very small role and also a very young Helen Hunt.  This movie will take you back to the amusement parks (and life in general) of the 1970s.  The hairstyles, fashions, etc. will put you through a time warp.  The musical score is pretty good in this movie.  The acting is very good.  The last scene in the movie was filmed at the amusement park that is now known as Six Flags Magic Mountain outside of Los Angeles (I'm proud to say I visited Six Flags Magic Mountain back in 2002).

If you're a suspense movie fan and an amusement park/roller coaster enthusiast like I am, then I highly recommend seeing this movie.  I also recommend it if you like films with a sense of nostalgia.",1390608000,,1117,4.557788944723618

71546,3,0783229399,"I discovered this film only recently during a nostalgia trip in the 70s (which included also ""Skyjacked"" and ""Two minutes warning""). I found this thing watchable, but no more. Below some more observations with limited SPOILERS.

This film is a thriller about a lonely bomber (Timothy Bottoms) who sabotages rollercoasters in attraction parks and then blackmails the owners into paying him ransom, to stop the attacks. His attacks are skilfully disguised as accidents, but he finally attracts the attention of a technical inspector (George Segal) and an FBI team headed by an aging, but still valiant special agent (Richard Widmark). Amongst other actors there is Henry Fonda who appears just in a cameo and very young Helen Hunt, in her very first role on the screen.

This is not a bad film, but since 1977 we could see many similar stories with more drama, more explosions, more victims and better effects - and therefore it appears pretty aged and it is possible to anticipate everything in advance. I also found the ending scenes a little bit silly and really anti-climactic.

But still, this film has some charm, as it shows an era which now seems almost prehistoric. Also, it can be interesting to see it just to realise WHAT was the competition to the first ""Star Wars"" movie in 1977 (yes, the poor ""Rollercoaster"" opened on the same day...). But I will not keep my DVD, as I think it is a film to see just once.",1360713600,,1419,4.7368421052631575

71553,4,0783229399,"This film has it's moments and in general is good entertainment for the genre in 1970's, unfortunately it lead to the demise of a new and short lived movie enhancement experience called  ""Sensurround.""  Now movie fans of the 70's remember the advertising hype for this catastrophic noise festival. Yes the use of powerful,loud,monsterously tall, crack the cement,bass thundering sounds emanating from the speakers, using the echo and accoustics of the theater to give one the feel of being there, it's almost as bad as that photographic 180 degree film screen where you stand and it suggests one was in the movie , the only thing that was good for was to see if your visual balance-acuity was any good. Sorry but both failed miserably, it was some what useful in the films Earthquake and Midway but in this film it holds a so-so usage. In Midway it enhances the guns going off on the ships and in Earthquake it shook the floor simulating vibration of the quake, but if you want reality and the sound and feel effect, it occurs if you go to the actual amusement park and stand next to the rickety old wooden rollercoasters of the late 60's, so really ,who need sensurround? Anyway, the plot here is so-so but fitting for the that time era(no way it could compare to today's standards) the music lends an tense aire to the plot and makes one wonder just how bad is the next explosion is gonna be and how much damage there is, basically the only realistic horror display is the first coaster he blows up and the devestating crash scene as cars hurl bodies off high tracks and crash through signs and of course the blood curdling screams of the crowd. Unfortunate this wasn't one of Henry Fonda's better movie roles but then again most who starred in it didn't get much better exposure. Of course if you notice, this also had Helen Hunt, at a younger age and probably prepared her for her role in Twister. When originally released in the 70's most of these films were correct fitting the movie genere of the times, mostly disaster films and brought crowds to the movie theaters. What can you say, a good batch of fast clips, a quick,undefined story line and flash images on the brain, tease and spark curiosity to ensure movie previews will continually bring in the revenue no matter what, even if the movie does bomb out. Who knows maybe in twenty or more years some one will bring back the Sensurround and apply it to more modern films, really what have we got to lose.......just our hearing !",1282780800,,2491,4.595505617977528

71555,4,0783229399,"Rollercoaster is one of the finer examples of great 1970s thrillers you'll find, but for some reason, it's mostly flown under the radar for all these years. Maybe it was because it came out in a time where disaster films ruled the box office, but in a film that seemed to fit the bill, there simply isn't much disaster. Or maybe it's the fact that a movie set around roller coasters, or people blowing them up simply isn't exiting/interesting enough. But I assure can assure you, Rollercoaster is surprisingly good and tense. It thrills, it excites, and it gives you serious hate for 70s fashion/music. Did I mention it can also be found on Netflix Watch Instantly?

The real highlight here is Timothy Bottoms as the rollercoaster bomber. He's never given a name, he's never given a motive, and he's only credited as ""Young Man."" He's the type of guy you wouldn't mind hanging out with, and as long as his plan comes together, he's actually a pretty happy guy. Timothy Bottoms does a lot with little to go on, and succeeds by operating the character using the delivery in the minimal dialogue he's given, and his facial expressions. Oh, those facial expressions. He doesn't even need to speak. The camera could stay on Timothy Bottoms' face the whole movie and you'd stay compelled. It's hard to believe that this kid would one day grow up to be a George W. Bush impersonator and ""The Asylum"" member, but hey, he's the highlight of this movie. Plus, Helen Hunt is in this film briefly, and the great Steve Guttenburg makes a quick cameo in his first movie role.

The plot is fairly straight forward. Imagine a terrorist bomber blowing stuff up and setting stuff on fire as part of an elaborate extortion scheme involving amusement parks. But as simple as the proceedings are, they're still well done. Scenes/shots linger and go on forever. The camera keeps following roller coasters, lingers on bombs waiting to go off, lingers on faces, and shots of people having fun at an amusement park. It all makes for surprisingly tense proceedings, and hey, it was the 70s, so it all seems plausible. Also, George Segal makes for a likable main character to follow around, and tends to lighten to mood and make the proceedings more enjoyable, even though he's a lowly safety inspector. The only real problem I have with the movie is the ending, which simply feels to rushed.

Overall, if you can get past the bad 70s fashion and music, you have a great performance by Timothy Bottoms, a roller coaster crashing, and a Steve Guttenburg sighting. What's not to love? Check this underrated thriller out at least once, and make sure to grab some cotton candy while you're at it.",1278806400,4,2665,4.702355460385439
71556,4,0783229399,"I first saw part of this little gem in 1985 on TV, but never got to see all of it until about 1997 - 20 years after it was made, when I found a copy on VHS. After seeing it on the IMDB again I decided to pick it up from Amazon. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.

The premise is fairly straightforward; a psychopathic young terrorist (Timothy Bottoms) is first seen planting a small explosive on the tracks of a rollercoaster at a now-defunct park in Virginia. After the park opens, the fiend is seen detonating the explosive, and when the rollercoaster hits the spot, horror ensues. Cars fly off the tracks; a car falls upside-down on top of its passengers; and another crashes through a sign. Immediately after the tragedy, a safety inspector, Harry Calder (George Segal) is called in to investigate. He soon finds the disaster was a deliberate act, and things get worse when a similar accident involving the destruction of a ride by arson occurs in Pittsburgh. The FBI, led by Special Agent Simon Davenport (Henry Fonda) reluctantly takes Harry up of his suspicion that the next target will be a newly-opening rollercoaster in California, and they enter the park to try to find the bomber. Will they succeed...or will another rollercoaster go off the rails?

The acting is pretty stellar; Fonda, Richard Widmark, Segal & Bottoms all turn in good performances. Susan Strasberg is also effective as Harry's wife Fran, and look for a young Helen Hunt as Harry's daughter.

This isn't a true disaster movie, such as the Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno; it's meant strictly as a thriller, and it more than meets that expectation. The only reason I give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is the relatively small number of special features; it only includes a theatrical trailer (which is pretty good) and production notes.",1268092800,2,1827,4.757097791798107
71557,5,0783229399,"I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1977. I still like the film on the small screen.  However, the makers of this DVD really did make it for small screen.  They used the wrong resolution when creating this DVD and the picture is way too narrow and way too short.  You get a lot of black space on your TV screen on the top and on the sides.  I guess they did this so the film would fit on a single-layer DVD...to save money.  It really ruins the effect of the film.

As far as the film goes, there are some errors in the film.  I know The Great American Revolution like the back of my hand and can tell when Calder points to the loop on the construction drawings, near the end of the film.....where he says, ""I'm an Inspector, not an Engineer..... he'd want momentum, maximum speed, probably coming off the loop....somewhere between here and here..if it's there at all"".  He is actually pointing to the last turn of the ride, not the loop!  Didn't anyone tell him how to read prints!  There are some other errors.. for instance, during the first run of the ride the director shows the cars nearing the top of the long decline before the loop, but in another shot a second earlier, they show the cars at the top of the third hill.  These 2 positions are entirely different locations on the ride. Also, at the end of the film, when Bottoms is running for his life, the directors show the coaster cars going through the center of the loop.  But, after that shot they show Bottoms running for quite a while before he is hit on the last turn of the ride.  There is no way these two times can coincide. After the train goes through the center of the loop, it is just a matter of seconds before the trains enter the last turn.

But, criticisms aside, it is still a good film.  Especially if you like rollercoasters. I went to Magic Mountain in May of 1976 when The Revolution opened.  It is truly sad what Six Flags has done to the ride.  It is unfortunate I did not own a digital camera in those days to capture The Revolution in it's true glory.

In hindsight, it was a pretty dopey effect, but it was novel at the time and worth noting.
The film itself is a decently paced thriller. Segal playing a saftey inspector/detective trying to find the cuckoo who's been bombing rollercoasters and blackmailing the amusement park bigwigs in the middle of peak season. Of course, upper management won't do the sensible thing and shut the parks down, so Segal must work extra hard while trying to nab the offending bomber. Segal also tries to quit smoking, which is not a good thing to quit when you are stressing as he definitely is ( and you may be too while watching the defuse scenes)

71563,4,0783229399,"I vividly remember seeing this movie in the theater as a kid -- it was summer and a few years after Jaws.  The gimmick was ""Senssurround!"" but we really believed it -- it did seem like the theater shook during some of the rollercoaster scenes.

Watching it now, many years later, it holds up well as a Jaws-inspired 70s film.  In the summer people love to go to the beach....or to an amusement park.  Imagine Timothy Bottoms as the shark -- the director surely does -- as he swims around the amusement park, while Lalo Schiffrin provides a Jaws-like menacing score, before Bottoms slowly and methodically strikes again.

George Segal makes a decent Brody, though it's impossible to look at his performance now and not think it's a bit camp.  You have the same crew of town elders like you do in Jaws, seeking to suppress and downplay the threat due to business concerns.  And you have the same summer kids, in their 70s outfits and feathered hair, enjoying what should be innocent fun...until Bottoms strikes again.

As a reviewer mentioned, there is a short clip of Sparks performing at Magic Mountain in the final showdown, which is a plus.  And a very cute and very young Helen Hunt.

Though there are more ""thrill"" rides there today, there is less magic.  Scooby Doo is the only carryover.

Aside form this, it's a decent film.  Actually the best of all the 70's disaster films, but will seem dated for younger viewers.  But definitely worth viewing if you went to the Parks back then, or are interested in seeing what the parks use to be like.",1173225600,,818,4.568493150684931

71570,3,0783229399,"Based on the title, I had originally thought Rollercoaster (1977) was going to be a disaster type movie that were popular in the 70's like Airport  (1970), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), or The Towering Inferno (1974), but it turned out to be something a lot different.  I guess it was for the best, as a film about a rollercoaster that was running out of control, throwing stars of old off at various points, probably wouldn't have worked too well and would have been like scraping the bottom of the disaster-venue barrel.

The film stars George Segal as Harry Caulder, a government safety inspector who's thrown into a situation having to deal with a terrorist (Timothy Bottoms) bent on blowing up rollercoasters, harming and killing innocent amusement park patrons unless his demands are met.  Also in the film are Richard Widmark as federal agent Hoyt, Henry Fonda as Caulder's boss (Fonda appears for like a total of five minutes in two or three scenes...long enough to pick up a check, I suppose), Susan Strassberg as Caulder's girlfriend, and a teenagish Helen Hunt as Caulder's daughter.

The film wastes very little time as Bottom's character strikes, blowing up part of the track on a large rollercoaster.  The cars crash, people die horribly, and Caulder is called in...Apparently, he had just inspected this ride a few months prior, and now this accident and the subsequent deaths has everyone asking, ""What happened?""  No one, it seems, has bother to do a thorough inspection of the damaged track, otherwise they would have noticed it had been blasted apart, and everyone is assuming it a just an accident due to equipment failure or some such thing.  I would suspect the insurance company would want to have had this done before they paid out any monies, but what the heck do I know?  Anyway, another accident happens at another park, and Caulder gets wind of a meeting between the big wigs of five different amusement parks all over the country, and decides to try and attend.  During the meeting, they learn the motive behind the attacks, and also learn of the terms required by the terrorist in order for him to stop.  Since attacks by the same person happened in different states, the feds (Widmark) are called in, but the terrorist has taken a shine to Caulder, and requests he be involved in the events soon to follow.  Will the terrorists' demands be met?  Or will he strike again?  What exactly is his deal?  Does he just hate rollercoasters, or amusement parks in general?

The film wasn't bad.  As I said, this isn't a disaster movie, but more of a game of cat and mouse, with the feds chasing Bottoms' character, trying to determine his next move.  Caulder, who managed to piece together a number of elements early on, get caught up in the proceedings, having to play the terrorists' games hoping to avoid any future tragedies.  Other than the somewhat gruesome scenes (which were actually toned down prior to release) at the beginning, this film just had a strong feel of a television production to me.  There was an effort to try and create a level of suspense, in the sense of a Hitchcock film, but the predictability overwhelmed this more often than not, along with a few glaring plot holes, stereotypical characters, and contrived plot devices.  And the music...I like Lalo Schifrin, but I found the music that accompanied Bottoms' character, especially when he was getting ready to do evil things, to become very annoying.  The rollercoaster photography was nice, and I am sure it played much better on the big screen, and the actors were all competent in their roles.

Presented here is a nice looking wide screen print, although not without some very minor speckling on the picture in one or two parts.  It's noteworthy to mention the film was released in Sensurround, a process that `augmented the violent action on screen by intense waves of high decibel sound, enough, in some documented cases, to crack ribs.' according to Haliwell's Film Companion.  The gimmick never really caught on as it often disrupted films being show in adjoining theaters, causing complaints to theater managers who decided it just wasn't worth the trouble.  Only two other films, Earthquake (1974) and Midway (1976) also used the process before it was discontinued.  Special features include production notes, bios, a trailer, and some web links.  While predictable, Rollercoaster was not a bad ride, although at a run time of two hours, it could have been shortened a little bit, adding a little more quickness to the pacing.  Oh yeah, look for a cameo by Steve Guttenberg around 82 minutes into the film, as Federal Agent #3.  Don't blink, or you'll miss it.

71572,3,0783229399,"Okay, nobody ever thought it was really safe to get on the rollercoaster, but a mysterious master criminal (Timothy Bottoms) - who knows a thing or two about electronics, demolitions and engineering - has his own ideas for adding chills.  Planting remote control bombs on tracks - precisely at the spot where the coaster goes fastest - he derails them in a series of spectacular and deadly ""accidents"". At first written off as accidents, the bomber moves from smaller parks to larger ones with flashier rides and richer owners. Only intrepid insurance investigator Harry Calder (George Segal) from LA spots an obvious pattern and suspects terrorism while the incidents are first written off as accidental tragedies. Worming his way into a meeting of the amusement park CEO's, Calder attracts the attention of the FBI, and then the mystery man himself. Calder is maverick, not a team player - he's not afraid to call it like it is or follow any lead to the ends of the world, but in Bottoms's character, Harry's met his match. The bomber turns Harry into a reluctant participant of the crime, having him collect the extortion money from the park owners and deposit it on a dead drop area in the middle of a targeted amusement park. In an elaborate sequence, and communicating with Harry over a walkie-talkie, the bomber sends Harry on an elaborate wild-goose chase in which he's forced to ride every ride while carrying the money and what may be a bomb.
As a thriller, ""Rollercoaster"" is a mixed bag.  The script posits Bottoms's mystery man as a cool extortionist - but the technical details of his mastery are glossed over.  Also, in a film about rollercoasters, there's nary a mention about the science behind them.  There's so little care about the engineering behind them that machines in this movie raise little if any chills whether in their designed role to scare people or thier scripted role in which they actually kill people.  This was probably just TV-movie of the week fodder for the late 1970's.  Still it's irresistible today mostly because it is a sort of time capsule for big-budget disaster movies from the period, featuring established big-name stars in meaningless and small parts (Henry Fonda has a bit part as George Segal's boss in a scene where we learn that Harry isn't a team player; Richard Widmark plays the head FBI investigator, an anonymous part that allows him to be cordial enough at first when he thinks he'll never have to deal with Segal's character, and appropriately annoyed when that proves impossible; Helen Hunt plays Harry's daughter in a part that gives no hint to her future fame). With the ludicrous 70's fashions, the rotary phones and the cars and the flick is funnier than scary. Add in the unintended irony of cinematography that almost looks like a travelogue for parks that nobody would want to visit after watching this movie, and ""Rollercoaster"" is an absurd treat. At its heart, the film is paced like a rollercoaster - slow only to build up to the scary parts (usually when the mystery man worms his way onto the scene).

71573,4,0783229399,"I just watched this movie for the first time since 1977 when it was released. It was every bit as enjoyable on T.V. (with help from a surround sound system and bigscreen) as I remembered it in the theatres. It takes you back to the semi-innocent 70's and brings back memories (for those of you old enough) of what theme parks were like back then.
I think a lot of credit should be given to Timothy Bottoms for his outstanding performance as the bomber/terrorist. He really stole the show with his quiet, devious, loner-esque character with the choir-boy face. He reminded me of the villan played in the movie Dirty Harry. What ever happened to Timothy Bottoms?
My favorite part of the movie is where George Segal's character is being led around Kings World theme park by the bomber in an attempt to lose the tail being put on by the FBI. It was an ingenious and believable plan that had everyone fooled.
It all adds up to a tense and exciting movie with a creative plot and excellent actors to complete the package. If you can get used to the bell-bottom pants and polyester again, you'll really enjoy this thriller. Cheers.",1043020800,17,1124,4.569306930693069

Harry is proven right but his investigation attracts the attention of the terrorist who drags him into a dangerous cat and mouse game for a million dollar's worth of ransom money.

71578,4,0783229399,"The fact that this movie has been long classified as a disaster flick is utterly ridiculous. There is a horrific ""accident"" on a roller coaster at the beginning of the film, but that's it as far as disasters go. The incident provides us with some insight into the mindset of a psychotic, nameless character played by Timothy Bottoms. Rollercoaster is an above average cat-and-mouse thriller that provides a lot of suspense, and an entertaining performance by George Segal.
The later part of the movie takes place at Magic Mountain amusement park near Los Angeles--well before Six Flags bought it and then ruined the Revolution roller coaster that is heavily featured in the film. Seeing Revolution as it was when it first opened (at the time the only modern coaster to incorporate a 360 degree vertical loop) was both interesting and a little sad. Revolution is barley recognizable today since the surrounding foliage has all but completely hidden the ride. Six Flags has also added numerous brakes that almost completely stop the train several times, and the most uncomfortable shoulder harnesses imaginable. Many similar rides built around the same time (and by the same manufacturer) are currently in operation without all this added hardware. Enough said about that.
Rollercoaster is a fine suspense thriller. Just prepare yourself for a serious time-warp back to the mid 70's. The twangy electric guitar music, clothes and hairstyles date this movie quite a bit. Remember lip gloss? However I truly enjoyed Rollercoaster, and it also provided me with a nice, long forgotten ride on the once proud and famed Revolution.

Remember it was made in 77 and I think a lot of us are now ""spoiled"" by all the razzamatazz movies have nowadays. As an added bonus look for a young Helen Hunt playing George Segals daughter. I loved the song ""Big Boys"" that played toward the end of the film as they look for more devices that the madman (Timothy Bottom) may have left.

71580,5,0783229399,"Think you're safe from terror when you enter an amusement park?  This underrated 1977 thriller will make you think twice about that assumption.  What JAWS did for the beaches, DUEL for the highways, and PSYCHO for motel showers, ROLLERCOASTER does for amusement parks--turns them into places where absolutely no one is safe.
George Segal is quite good as a cynical civic inspector looking into two very suspicious amusement park ride ""accidents.""  He soon comes into phone contact with a young man (Timothy Bottoms), who is actually perpetrating these accidents to extort one million dollars from the owners of these parks.  The result is slowly escalating suspense leading to a very tense conflict between Bottoms, Segal, and an FBI team headed by a very cynical agent (Richard Widmark).
Boosted by Lalo Schifrin's often sinister Herrmann/Stravinsky-like score and James Goldstone's efficient direction, ROLLERCOASTER isn't the disaster movie it is often pegged as.  Rather, it is an unjustifiably overlooked movie that deserves a revival.  Look for a very young Helen Hunt as Segal's daughter.",994723200,22,1095,5.374269005847953

7790710,4,0783229399,"In the seventies a new sound system was developed in the hope of increasing attendance at movies. The system was created for Universal Studios and called Sensurround. The first film using the system was EARTHQUAKE. The system was basically four huge speakers located in the corners of the theater that would blare out lowered bass tones and sound effects at certain sequences in the film causing patrons to actually feel the sound as well as hear it. Only a few films were made this way and the new concept didn't take root.  But there were several movies made using it, including ROLLERCOASTER.

An unknown protagonist (Timothy Bottoms) sneaks into an amusement park and rigs a bomb on one of their rollercoasters. Detonating it remotely the resulting wreck kills several of those on the ride at the time. Safety inspector Harry Calder (George Seagal), who had signed off shortly before this incident, is called in to investigate what happened.

When another incident happens across the country Harry believes the two are connected. Discovering there is a meeting of amusement park owners taking place in Chicago he flies there to confront them. They let him know that theyve been blackmailed by the bomber who says he will blow up more rollercoasters if they don't pay him $1 million.

Harry connects with the FBI agent in charge of handling the blackmail case, Hoyt (Richard Widmark). Harry carries the ransom money to the park the bomber has next targeted and told to wait for a phone call at a pay phone. The bomber tells him there is a bomb set to go off, tells him where to pick up a two way radio and then sends him back and forth across the park riding various rides. Knowing what the FBI has planned to do he tells Harry to signal the drop has been made but sends him to drop it elsewhere. Afterwards Hoyt tells Harry the money was marked.

The bomber calls Harry at home blaming him for the marked bills. He then tells him he will get revenge. Calder, feeling that the next attack will be launched at him personally, tells Hoyt that the most logical target will be a new coaster opening up at Magic Mountain that he signed off on. The Great American Revolution is set to open that weekend with plenty of fanfare and cameras rolling. Will this be the location? And if so will Harry be able to stop the bomber?

The movie plays out as a solid detective story, a thriller that plays out well as the story progresses. The fact that Harry is a ride inspector makes his character that much more interesting as opposed to his being a regular detective. The entire film is much like its title, a movie that moves up and down and offers thrills from start to finish.

Seagal was at his peak at this time and does a great job as Harry. The inclusion of Widmark as the FBI agent works well here too, a reliable face movie fans trusted at the time. Bottoms does a great job as the unhinged bomber. And in a small role as Harrys young daughter is the then unknown Helen Hunt.

Extras include the original SENSURROUND soundtrack, an interview with associate producer/writer Tommy Cook, a still gallery, radio spots and the original theatrical trailer.",1508716800,,3148,4.618962432915922
