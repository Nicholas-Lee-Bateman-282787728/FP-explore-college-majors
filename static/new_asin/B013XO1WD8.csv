Cleaning is her ideal job and she excels at it. She hos has desires, which leads her to doing things that she may not have done with enough time to think.

She also is a voyeur; in that she hides in the guests rooms to observe what they get up to, and I do not mean which channels they want to watch on the television either. Then one day she experiences an encounter between a dominatrix and her client and she is inexorably drawn to the exotic and alluring creature  and so begins her journey.

Now this is a film that will appeal to as many as it repels in that it is about sexual unorthodoxy but is not a sex film per se. It is a very good and even intimate exploration of lust and desire and the fetishistic side of human nature. It is well made and acted and has those moments where very little appears to be happening but that helps juxtapose the mundanity of the ordinary as it segues into the extraordinary in other peoples ordinariness. In German with good sub titles this is for you if you enjoy films that area bit left field and as such recommended.",1476748800,,1213,4.1752136752136755
