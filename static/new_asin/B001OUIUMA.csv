8331602,5,B001OUIUMA,"I originally purchased this dvd back in 2009 for myself.  It is perfect for true beginners to exercise, not only larger women.  I really like that the video does NOT fall into the trap of the many so-called ""beginner"" videos which include moves like standing squats and standing leg lunges - which are hard on the knees and require strength that a beginner usually doesn't have.

I would say this an all-over conditioning beginner video.  The video starts out with a gentle standing warm-up routine and progresses to exercises seated in a chair, follwed by a couple of standing exercises with the chair for support, ending with a gentle standing cool down.  Rochelle seems to understand that moving between floor and standing exercises is difficult for heavy people so she does not do this in the workout.  The movements are standing or sitting on a chair.

The video is professionally produced and Rochelle's voice is soothing and her manner is supportive.  She explains the parts of the body the activities designed to strengthen.

After the conditioning workout, Rochelle works with one of the students on breathing and and core strengthening.  These exercises can be practiced on the floor or in bed.

This video is a keeper!",1337299200,,1229,4.91747572815534

Most of the video is done in a seated position with an emphasis on technique and the application to daily activities. The video is designed for beginners or those who have been inactive for a long time. It provides a foundation for embracing a lifestyle of movement.",1231891200,4,709,8.86111111111111
