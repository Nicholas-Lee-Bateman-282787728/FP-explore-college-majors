8731332,1,B014LHPH2S,"It was OK, but overall not impressed.  It has some interesting, realistic looking pictures on the cover. Never showed them during the film.  They showed plenty of skeletons, but nothing that appeared unique and no size reference to show that they were anything more than ordinary skeletons.  Showed several burial mounds and several newspaper clippings and some hearsay accounts that we are supposed to accept as evidence. Duplicated/repeated themselves continually throughout the production. Saying it more than once adds credibility?

Also we are to believe there is a big conspiracy in place hiding the evidence so that Darwin can't be proved wrong and that is why there are no skeletons to show.  Apparently the Smithsonian and the scientific community (and also some inferences that the Church) are behind the conspiracy.

The series ""In Search of Aliens"" does a much better job of discussing the topic and presenting evidence.",1471132800,2,932,5.263513513513513
