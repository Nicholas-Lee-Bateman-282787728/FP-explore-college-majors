2925893,1,B000UVV2AG,"I purchased this DVD on impulse, having enjoed two other Tony Jaa action flicks.  WHAT AN ERROR!
This DVD is so bad, if I could rate it lower than one star, I would. I could not stomach this travesty beyond 20 minutes.
The dubbing is HORRIBLE.  The camera work is HORRIBLE.  The story line is MORONIC and I have no hope for any ACTION in this grainy, colorless, DVD.
Tony Jaa is a minor character here...where as ONG-BAK actually STARS jaa, and IS a very good movie.",1210550400,,466,4.333333333333333
2925894,2,B000UVV2AG,"If you saw Ong Bak or the Protector, don't be assuming your going to see that stuff here. I still haven't been able to watch more than 20 min because even if you listen to the Thai audio track, the mouths are out of sync.",1203379200,,221,3.933333333333333
2925895,1,B000UVV2AG,"This is the worst movie I had ever watched in my entire life.  The plot was so poor as well as the actions. The filmed was poorly made and I believe back in 1996, there were quality movies have been made but this does not qualify a bit to be one.  Where is Tony by the way ! Zombies in the jungle, tribemen and rebel-like soldiers,,,wow what a waste.  I can say the budget was about 10-25K US$ or maybe less.  Where can you find a golden stone treasure that even the King of Jordan and Prince of Saudi would like to buy it for 1B US$ which only lies beside the riverbank where the rebels live. One more, an almost hundred rebel soldier attacked by 2-3 good guys and yet the explosion is everwhere as if they were attacked by vietcongs..
Those who are fan of Tony Jaa, never ever try renting, buying or even watching this movie.  The cover was deceptively made to fool the consumers. Too dark, too slow, extremely poor movie.  ZERO rating for me.",1202083200,2,945,4.251396648044692
2925896,5,B000UVV2AG,"This movie is a piece of garbage. First of all it is grossly mis-advertised. The plot description on the back of the DVD cover makes it sounds as if Tony Jaa is the hero of the movie protecting an artifact from bad guys, when in fact the exact opposite is true. Tony Jaa is a bad guy who has about 7 minutes of screen time. As for the plot, it makes less than no sense, the dubbing is horrific (I noticed the voices for one character changing through out the movie), at one point the dubbing just stops for a few minutes. There are zombies, black goblins, a big German guy named Smith, and for those who appreciate the art of bad cinema, this is a gem. I admit your brain needs to be wired a certain way to find this kind of thing funny, but if it is, you'll be laughing for days.",1200528000,3,780,4.071428571428571
2925897,1,B000UVV2AG,"I was first introduced to Tony Jaa in the film The Protector, which I enjoyed very much. When I came across Battle Warrior, with the 2007 release date, I was really looking forward to watching the movie but was very disappointed. This movie was produced in 1996, although you'd never know it from the DVD printing. In fact, I had to search the internet for information about this film since I simply could not believe this was actually a Tony Jaa film, it's so bad...

Yes, the movie is campy and old-style dubbed, and it's entertaining to some degree because of it. However, it's actually very boring and poorly filmed. Some of the scenes are so dark you can't see anything that's going on.

Bottom line is, if you can stomach the lousy filming, mediocre fight scenes, and almost no Tony Jaa, you might enjoy this movie. Otherwise, I would say the promotional statements on the DVD documentation are down-right and purposefully deceptive as to the date of this film. It will not stop me from purchasing other Tony Jaa movies (his fighting style is simply amazing) - but I will be more careful in the future about any further releases. The Protector is a keeper. Battle Warrior ended up in the ""don't bother viewing again"" section of my DVD library.",1197590400,11,1249,4.647058823529412
2925898,1,B000UVV2AG,"This is strictly a marketing ploy. The movie stinks, is poorly shot and everything about it is sub-standard quality. Don't waste your time. Check out Tony Jaa's other films though.",1195344000,7,180,5.033333333333333
2925899,5,B000UVV2AG,"It's been too long since we've seen a new Tony Jaa film!
This is an older one but it's a good one.
The action is not on the Ong Bak tip(but then what is????)but you get plenty of it.
Plot involves mercenaries going after a stone tablet in the Golden Triangle and Tony Jaa plays the bodyguard of the warlord there.
He gets his own showcase to strut his stuff.
There's all kinds of action including guns and explosions,etc. so it's not a boring film at all.
There are some familiar faces in the crowd from Tonys more recent films including his main man Panna who has an outstanding guest appearance.
My favorite are these `black goblins' as they are called!
The dubbing is funky and its also in original Thai with subtitles.

The bonus disc is loaded with all kinds of new Jaa materials including interviews and demos,etc.
There's also interviews with soem of the stars of the film and the production company is featured with a new star and film called Brave.
Nothing for Jaa to lose sleep over mind you but its very interesting to see how things evolve.
One of the leads is actually a director now and is connected to the production company(the son of the owner??).
This is from the same company that made Spirited Killer and Born to Fight(original)and a thousand Panna films it seems.

Definitely worth having in the collection while we wait for Tonys next blockbuster.",1194912000,,1369,4.583673469387755

8215210,4,B000UVV2AG,"If you try to view this movie as you would other Tony Jaa movies, you'll be highly disappointed. Especially since Tony is a bad guy who doesnt show up till the end.

But if you enjoy cheesy kung fu movies with poor dubbing, you'll get a kick out of this.

Its about a group of good guys who have to travel through the jungle to reclaim an artifact from some bad guys. But on their journey, they have to get through some karate chopping zombies, what appears to be african warriors (they're Thai people painted black with white lips and eyebrows), as well as other crazy groups hanging out in the jungle. The main bad guy is this insane over the top villian complete with evil laugh. And at the end there are a bunch of crazy pointless explosions. If you pay attention, when theres an explosion, everybody even remotely close to the explosion will do a front flip. Sometimes they'll be facing it, turn around, and then front flip.

I love cheesy kung fu movies and would put this up there with the older Drunken Master with Jackie Chan.",1405382400,,1035,4.436842105263158
8215211,1,B000UVV2AG,"One of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The film quality was very poor, and it did not make since.",1399939200,,105,3.8181818181818183
8215212,1,B000UVV2AG,"Im a big fan of Tony Jaa, he's almost up there with jackie Chan(not just yet).  But this is my second time falling for the photo shop, up to date promo cover. The first time it happened with ""Spirited Killer"", and Tony was barely in that as well, this movie...... I'm use to horrible Dubbing, but this movie, I was done with the movie, when the big Australian dude came into the picture and when he started talking, they gave him a voice of what sounded like a(n) old asian man that spoke broken english. I couldn't stomach watching the rest, I was seriously disappointed.",1283040000,,572,4.447619047619048
8215213,1,B000UVV2AG,"If you enjoyed Ong-Bak,Thai Warrior,watch it again. Don't waste your time or money on this. A really annoying villain, and zombies in the jungles of Thailand aren't the biggest problems. The action, special effects and the whole script are really lame. It isn't bad enough to be funny, just disappointing.",1267142400,,305,5.12
8215214,1,B000UVV2AG,"Oh gosh this is terrible. Poor quality all around and nothing but running around and shooting and fighting. Hardly a script. Inexcusable photography. Why are there special features? I must admit that I was so turned off that I did not look at them. I was in no mood even to be amused.

I liked a lot of things about The Protector and decided to give this a try. But any similarity was unrecognizable.

Not a keeper!",1236556800,,415,4.376623376623376
8215215,1,B000UVV2AG,"Oh, this film is terrible and is nothing like the quality of ""Ong Bak"".  A minimal plot about the rescue of a archiologist/treasure hunter from a large group of drug-smugglers, pitiful dialog, simple photography, and weak action scenes make this film worthy of the trashcan.  Much of the climactic battle at the end is done with gunfire and small explosions (with the exception of the guard towers - they explode into fireballs) instead of Thai martial arts.  I did have a chuckle at the cringe-worthy conversations between the characters but otherwise this is not worth wasting either time or money on.",1217808000,,603,4.9504950495049505
