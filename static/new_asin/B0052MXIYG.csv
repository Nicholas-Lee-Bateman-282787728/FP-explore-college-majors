4530161,5,B0052MXIYG,Was very pleased! It was a great dvd to share with the younger generation. Very memerable for those that grew up with it.,1355270400,,121,4.304347826086956
4530162,5,B0052MXIYG,"My children are 10, 6, 3, and 2. All of them enjoy watching this together! My brother and I enjoyed
this show when we were little and now my children are enjoying it. I am so glad I found it on DVD!",1348012800,,198,3.738095238095238
4530163,4,B0052MXIYG,"While I agree this series is great to watch for nostalgic reasons, it has been just as much fun to watch 25 years later as it was when I was 5. This was purchased, partly for myself, and also for my 2 year old class on Fridays.  With each episode broken into two 10min individual cartoons, it works really great to end a Friday before going home.  Possitive lessons on friendship, honestly, kindness and love, I highly recommend it to anyone with kids aged 0-6.

Side note from how I love this series--picked it up at a store called in Houston called Fry's. I'm only upset to know that it's only worth $5 at Fry's and $9 on Amazon. What the heck?",1335484800,,646,4.278688524590164
4530164,4,B0052MXIYG,"The Get Along Gang was one of my all time favorite childhood cartoons. I still have my original Get Along Gang plushies. The minute I found out this really *was* out on DVD, I had to get it. Okay, so it doesn't have all 13 episodes, or the Nelvana pilot, but at this point in time, beggars can't be choosers. It does, however, have all of my personal favorites on it, so I can't complain. Hopefully someday, we will get the complete series, but until then, enjoy what they will give us. It's better than nothing.",1330992000,,512,4.34375
4530165,5,B0052MXIYG,"Just as stated...shipped super quick, just in time for Christmas. Hopefully my brother will enjoy it. Nothing like reliving our childhood through cartoons.",1324080000,,155,5.782608695652174
4530166,5,B0052MXIYG,"I remember watching this series in the 1980's myself. I thought this lasted more than 13 episodes. I was inspired by these characters as a Pre- teen as I drew them in my sketchbook. I asked my mother to buy me the plush of Montgomery Moose, Zipper cat and Bingo beaver.
 Actually, I still have the three plush minus their skates. Looking back, the cartoon episodes dealt with diversity in a different manner without it being obvious. A great learning tool on a Saturday morning as part of my ritual waiting to watch every Saturday.
 Purchasing this for myself and another one for a friend's child. What a glorious surprise!!!!",1320451200,,626,4.681818181818182
4530167,3,B0052MXIYG,The shipment came without trouble. The video was fun to show the kids and they enjoyed watching it. Movie came in great condition.,1319414400,,130,4.695652173913044
4530168,5,B0052MXIYG,"This is an awesome treat for a nostalgic gent such as myself.  This disc may not have ALL 13 episodes of the series on the disc,  but 10 out of 13 is close enough.
I am glad I get a chance to view one of my fave animates series of my childhood.",1315526400,,244,3.673076923076923
4530169,4,B0052MXIYG,Better it it was The Complete Series since their was only about 15 shows I see no resone we can't have an Complete Series DVD.,1311897600,8,126,4.08
4530170,3,B0052MXIYG,"The Get Along Gang is truly one of the staples of Saturday Morning Cartoons from the 1980s, and it bridged the gap between action fare (like Dungeons & Dragons or Mr. T) and the more ""good for you"" content of PBS (like Mr. Rodgers or Sesame Street.)  Originally created for a series of greeting cards (much like another anthropomorphic set of critters, the Shirt Tales) and stationary, these characters made their first jump to the small screen on Nickelodeon back in 1984 in a single pilot episode created by the Nelvana company.  When the shop was picked up for a series it was brought over to DiC Animation and then aired on CBS for three seasons consisting of a total of 13 episodes (each with two 11 minute segments.)

The series centers around 6 main characters, Monty (the moose), Dotty (the dog), Woolma (a sheep), Zipper (a cat), Bingo (a beaver), and Portia (a porcupine) who hang out in a train caboose clubhouse and have adventures around their town.  Each episode typically features a moral of good behavior, as well as a run in with the town bully Catchum (an aligator) and his toady Leland (a lizard.)

This is the firs time the series has been released on DVD in the US and it features 10 of the 13 original episodes.  It also excludes the original pilot episode.  The quality of the transfer seems to be at VHS quality.

Personally, though I'm extremely glad to finally have this DVD in my collection I find it odd that Cookie Jar/Millcreek didn't include a second disc with the final three episodes.  At such a low MSRP for these 10 I can't imagine them putting out a second disc with only three episodes for a couple bucks.  I guess most of the episodes are better than none though...",1311897600,14,1703,4.554098360655738
4530171,5,B0052MXIYG,"A fun 1980's cartoon. All the characters are animals that have adventures in the countryside and local town. The background artists did a great job on the countryside; rolling green hills and such. The story lines have them going through caves, riding pirate ships, making robots and so on. The production company produced Heathcliff and Denis the Menace; which are both on DVD from Mill Creek. Notable names in the production are Jean Chalopin, Scott Jeralds, Don Messick and Frank Welker. American Greetings helped with the production. Get Along Gang is as good as Hanna Barbera. About 4 hours on 1 discs.",1450137600,,607,4.96078431372549

4530175,5,B0052MXIYG,The get along gang is okay. I chose to check out an episode just to see if I would like it from an online site before choosing to purchase some episodes of it. Get along gang is like an early version of care bears.,1426032000,,214,3.8863636363636362

4530183,5,B0052MXIYG,"The Get Along Gang wasn't the funniest or most well-written cartoon in history...The humor and storywriting were simple and  tame and the animation had its share of glitches.  Yet, the show and the characters resonate in memory...and often shown in reruns for many years after its CBS network run.

The concept of animal kids living in something of a ""real world"" small town setting (circa 1980s) did have great potential for gentle identifiable humor.  There wasn't any fantasy world gimmickry and the kids didn't have super magical powers.  They lived their day to day life through their eyes as kids...making mistakes from time to time and trying to help each other out of trouble... and they remained friends no matter what differences or disagreements they might have.

While critics might complain about the ""conformity"" aspect of the show (that the gang kids all had to agree on the same thing in every story),  moral dilemmas like obeying the law, helping someone, or saving valuable things from destruction might make saying ""no"" against the gang's majority feelings a non-option...if one has a conscience.  When the kids usually hang out at Hoofnagel's Ice Cream Emporium, one never sees the kids eating the same colored flavored scoops of ice cream when they gather together...that was a rather clever way to dispel the ""Conformity"" stereotype..

Do the right thing...or act like a jerk.  Luckily the kids choose the former.

While it is disappointing to have the first 10 half hour programs (two 10 minute stories per half hour), the remaining 3 episodes can be found in the ""TV Toons To Go"" compilation from the same manufacturer.  Well worth the cost to buy for fans and for those new viewers who want to experience an example of the fondly remembered 80s tv cartoon boom.",1388966400,3,1786,4.936454849498328
4530184,5,B0052MXIYG,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She used to watch this as a child and enjoyed it immensely.  She will love having in her film library,1385078400,,148,4.068965517241379

4530186,5,B0052MXIYG,"This was a great cartoon back in the day.  I miss those days!  This is a good wholesome cartoon series.  I forgot what the premise of the show was but remembered it had some sort of ""moral to the story"" in each episode.  On that part I was right.  I wish cartoons had more of a point like these old ones!  It is nice to live in the idealistic world of cartoons sometimes, life is to real and serious, why make cartoons the same?  If you want to relive the days of good moral cartoons, watch the Get Along Gang.",1375488000,6,510,4.04

4530188,3,B0052MXIYG,The episode story lines are a little scarier than I remembered from my childhood.  Not so sure I want my kids watching a TV show about a kidnapping case.  But it was a good trip down memory lane.,1361059200,,195,4.105263157894737

4530190,5,B0052MXIYG,"Love this Dvd. A show from Saturday mornings in the eighties. It brings back great childhood memories. If you liked the Shirt Tales, you'll love this!",1358899200,,150,4.8076923076923075
8454047,2,B0052MXIYG,"While I like the show and all, the quality in which it is presented on this DVD is awful!  I have never complained about video quality before, but this one is just hard to watch.  First off the picture quality is probably as bad as steaming a low resolution video on dial up, the pixelation is very noticeable, but I could handle this if it was not for the screen shaking through the episodes.  The image is constantly shaking left and right to the point that I find it distracting and a bit dizzying.  I cannot believe none of the other reviews point this out!  In any scene where the characters are not moving this shaking is really hard to ignore.  In scenes where there is motion the pixelation draws your attention away from the shaking.  Nowhere on this DVD does the image look anything comparable to the DVD cover!

All I can figure is the quality on this DVD is just awful, or something is going on with my up-scaling Blu-ray player and 4k TV.  I will try this out on another set later and update if I see anything different, but this image shake seems apparent on the videos of it I watched online also - It's even worse on a big screen TV compared to my computer monitor.  Honestly at this point I question whether the DVD I received may have been fake or burnt, but even that would not account for the quality being so bad.  The only way I can explain this is that my guess is someone with a shaky hand videotaped a copy of this on VHS while playing it on TV with a 1990's video camera and then produced this DVD from their footage.  On the bright side the sound is good!",1501200000,,1582,4.236666666666666
8454048,5,B0052MXIYG,"I watched this as a kid. I find it wonderful that you can find all these old shows that was a part of your childhood and share them with your kids. The show is cute, my daughter really enjoyed watching these over and over.",1496448000,,222,4.068181818181818

I remember how we would be glued to the TV after school and on Saturday mornings for about 2 hours watching quality cartoons..... I don't care for the cartoons these days nor does my 6 Year old. I show him the classics ranging from the 60s-90s. He loves them and can't get enough. I remember watching the Get Along Gang and loving it. I introduced him to it and he gets so excited and can't stop watching the DVD.  I would recommend this to anyone with small children.,1460073600,,521,4.262626262626263
