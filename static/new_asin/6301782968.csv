Instead of just turning it off, for whatever reason I kept pausing it to go do other things & coming back to it. There was nothing really funny about Mob Story. If there was, I must have missed it. The only funny thing I ever remember happening was the part where the hitman licked his gun & it got stuck to his tongue because of the freezing weather. Now that was funny!!! Nothing really ever happens either. The only time something happens was the last 10-15 minutes which also had to be the best part (If you can even call it that) of the movie (I guess they decided to save the best for last, Ha Ha) As you've probably already guessed, Mob Story is a movie I would NOT recommend. If somebody told me ahead of time they were thinking of watching it, I'd tell them to skip it & watch something else. There are millions & millions of things you could be better off doing with your time so why do like I did & waste an hour & 33 minutes of your life you'll never get back",1497916800,,1057,4.062200956937799
7815796,1,6301782968,"OMG! Poorly written, incomprehensible plot and a waste of some good actors. One of the worst ""funny"" gangster movies ever. Don't waste you time, unless you need to see Winnipeg (if it is Winnipeg).",1385164800,,197,4.823529411764706
7815797,4,6301782968,"Here we have a joyous occasion where *three* under-recognized actors have a chance to deliver a nuanced and very entertaining performance. John Vernon (of course recognized as the Dean in ""Animal House"") is a fine character actor and can find ways of expressing anger or delight even when the script and direction take a downbeat turn. Al Waxman's plays a character in confusion and he, too, can make filet mignon out of chuck. Margo Kidder is the loopy, leggy underachiever, exotic dancer and paramour of, euphemistically speaking, an undesireable who agrees to complete the evil task conjured up by Don Luciano's (Vernon character) ex-cohort in crime.
The frigid setting itself is somehow made funny by the offbeat, effective directing and writing. Viewers, is this now considered a ""Cult Classic""?",1193356800,3,800,5.209302325581396
7815798,1,6301782968,"Okay, this is one of those very very low budget movies with a stupid story line that no one in their right mind would watch for entertainment or any other purposes.  The quality of the picture sucks, and the actos are horrendous.  The directing is the worst I have ever seen.  And the storyline is extremely boring.  If you are interested in wasting money on this movie, get it.  If you are trying to build a mob movie collection, and you want to have every movie ever made, get it.  But if you are a mob movie enthusiast, you are better off watching something else.  No one with any taste would watch this movie!",1097625600,4,613,4.324561403508772
