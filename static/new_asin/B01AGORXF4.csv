7600005,5,B01AGORXF4,"This is a very good documentary of the Jewish state.  Ive known about a few things about Herzel,  1917, 1948 for years. This DVD has a lot more info than I expected on the regathering of the Jews back to the Holy land and was very informative. I plan on watching it several times until the information absorbs in my brain.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1459987200,,352,4.303030303030303

8747285,2,B01AGORXF4,There isn't a great deal of depth to the analysis presented in this documentary.  I'd recommend 'Two Blue Lines'  and '1913: Seeds of Conflict' instead.,1529020800,,152,5.04

8747288,1,B01AGORXF4,"Pure propaganda. Even though I'm Palestinian (Christian), I tend to see the issue through both narratives. This film, however, is complete propaganda for the pro-Israel Evangelical/ Protestant Christians in the West. The work props itself as a documentary for the creation of the state of Israel, but it negates history that works against the Israeli cause and celebrates historical figures that promoted and carried out terrible acts against Palestinians, Muslim and Christian. Secondly, the film uses the Arabs as the enemy, the people who refused to accept Jews during the Holocaust via the ""White Papers"". Yet, no perspective was given to the Palestinians, a people who, since Theodore Herzl, saw generations of European Jews continually take over more of their native lands. And what's the movie's justification???? Because the Bible says it's their land no current documents should matter. Well....I guess with this line of thought, the Native Americans should kick Americans out of their homes...ISIS would have every right to establish a caliphate.... NOT. How utterly sad this film is.",1511827200,,1094,5.4035087719298245
8747289,5,B01AGORXF4,"Best documentary on the founding of Israel I've ever watched!  This is brilliantly done with exquisite detail to costumes and settings.  I love the Scriptures woven through it, and the reenactments are wonderful.",1506211200,2,212,5.393939393939394

8747291,3,B01AGORXF4,After seeing this I only hoped that the American Indians might be given back the United States and the other indigenous peoples of the world given back their ancestral lands as well. Sure this might be inconvenient- BUT IT's THE MORAL THING TO DO. The suffering and wholesale slaughter of these people by the European settlers seeking is a black stain that needs to be cleaned!,1502323200,,377,4.7272727272727275

8747293,5,B01AGORXF4,Excellent history of the rebirth of the State of Israel. I watched this in preparation for going on a trip to the Holy Land. I was not disappointed.
