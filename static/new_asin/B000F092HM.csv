2547275,4,B000F092HM,I liked the moves and workouts for different body parts. He explains the workouts well. The DVD is choppy. I would have liked to see an instructional section on each exercise then one that I could watch and follow the entire 18 minutes without switching from one title to another. I think this is meant as merely a way to learn specific moves then do your own routine without the DVD. Not what I expected but still good.,1312761600,3,420,4.397435897435898
2547276,1,B000F092HM,"Just to warn you that this is not a workout. It is a group of numbered separated exercises demonstrated in a very boring way. It is like an intro to a workout which demonstrates technique except that you don't get the workout. I felt very ripped off by this DVD. Each workout move has a number and the instructor demonstrates the move. This is a good start for someone who wants to borrow some of the exercises and try to make up a workout from them, a boring one. Most of the moves demonstrated for the lower body are done hanging on to either a doorknob of hanging onto a chair with an elastic band closed into a door so if you want to watch the exercises demonstrated you better have a television in front of a door, one that someone can't open from the other side or which you can lock, per the instructor. That said the exercises are effective and you can memorize some of them for those times when you can't use an exercise DVD or get to the gym, like when you are traveling or visiting your family. I'm going to toss this one in the trash though. I have plenty of exercise tapes that are actually workouts. If you want something that works really well and fast try the old FIRM exercise routines. The FIRM aerobic Workout with Weights Volume 3 is one of my favorites. After a month of that you will see your body fighting gravity! If you are a beginner try some of the Gilad DVDs and move on to the FIRM after you firm up a bit. Oh for the firm you need hand weights and a step stool thing. The old FIRM stool or the new one both work or you can rig up one of your own.",1254614400,20,1576,4.12012987012987

8116002,5,B000F092HM,"I purchased this system a long time ago and did the diet portion and I wanted to now concentrate on the exercises more, but I lost my CD and I wanted to make sure I was doing the exercises properly so I don't waste my time. I'm glad that it was available, only wish it could be a CD.",1488844800,,283,3.8135593220338984
8116003,5,B000F092HM,"Everyone should get this proper instruction on how to isolate and sculpt depending on what you like and how you want to look.  I left another review on Thurmond, and I just love him.  Don't like the 6 week Makeover Diet, but I consider this DVD and the Advanced one a treasure.",1453420800,,277,4.3076923076923075
8116004,5,B000F092HM,My sister bought this kit years ago and offered it to me and I have had it on my bookshelf. Now that I am ready to begin I only had the old VHS tape and I couldn't see how to do the exercises so I ordered this and I am so glad I did. Michael Thurmond knows his exercises and in the smallest time possible you get the biggest results. I have done the program before and I know it actually re-models your body by the cards in his system. I could see results in the first few days.,1416960000,4,478,3.8383838383838382

8116009,5,B000F092HM,This dvd is a part of the 6 Week Body Makeover program and I needed it to replace my VHS version. Product is in excellent condition & arrived fast. Thanks.,1346371200,,155,4.2
8116010,5,B000F092HM,"This is an instructional DVD to workout ""LESS"" & it only takes 18 minutes twice a week. The moves are short, you contract your muscles at certain times, and you only need the sculpting bands to do it. All by yourself, quickly, without looking at a bunch of people on TV everytime to mimic what they're doing. No weights needed, no big bulky machines. I tell all my friends about Michael Thurmond's system because it made me lose 25 lbs in 3 months and I came out with a lean body despite that I eat more food than before. I got compliments from many people. I suggest you try it, for about less than $10, you will be grateful to Michael Thurmond forever.",1315353600,2,654,4.32520325203252
