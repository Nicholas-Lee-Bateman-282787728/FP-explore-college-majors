8198441,5,B000R2QJMY,"Story of husband & wife escaping to a paradise island & living the dream, away from the war. Rampling was the most beautiful woman I have seen in film in a very long time. Movies such as this don't happen anymore due to modern film-making. It was absolutely wonderful & in a way--predictible.",1505001600,8,292,4.528301886792453
8198442,3,B000R2QJMY,Slow and somewhat predictable with an occasional interesting twist. But nothing special,1504483200,6,87,6.333333333333333
8198443,4,B000R2QJMY,"Since this movie is only on tape, I had to make my own DVD. It used to
be on TV in the days when VCRs were new and expensive.  The
premise of the movie is unique: a rich guy rides out the danger of war
on an isolated island---and of course complications ensue.  Leonard
Matlin didn't like it, but I did.  Remember, he only gave Meatballs a
1/2 star!  Charlotte Rampling is gorgeous, Peter O' Toole is cool.",1431820800,9,406,4.166666666666667
