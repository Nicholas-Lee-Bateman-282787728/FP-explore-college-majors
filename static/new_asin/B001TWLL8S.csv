8342359,4,B001TWLL8S,"I bought this item as a gift for a downhill rider who loves to watch riding videos. It was fun to see the actual work and set up that goes into the event, as well as interviews with the riders, however if you are more interested in the riding footage, you may be dissapointed. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of excellent quality video of the actual rides, including practice runs; most shot from above or a vantage point, paired with on the ground shots. However if you are expecting footage cut with fancy editing effects, you will not find it here. The main point is this video gives you the feel of actually being at and participating in a Red Bull Rampage event! The person I gave the gift for has gone to such an event, and also works frequently on building trails, so he thouroughly enjoyed the movie!",1276732800,2,812,4.3841059602649
