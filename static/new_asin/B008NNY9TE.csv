5170675,5,B008NNY9TE,"Overall a well produced and thought out series. The disc on WWII is riveting, and shows in a powerful way the massive effect of the Nazi movement on world history not only in a concrete way, but as this original 3-D footage shows,how mind control was perfected by these masters of communication. After several viewings of this disc, the power of 3D becomes as clear as the difference between H.D. and VHS, as far as the ability of the mind to accept the reality of the images being viewed and to really feel emotion as a response. This is something the whole family should enjoy.",1355616000,28,579,4.523809523809524
5170676,5,B008NNY9TE,"Ok lets be honest, all 3 of these movies kinda sucked.  All they did was take out the commercials so 20% of each 45 minute show is recapping like we're total idiots.  I wouldnt want to pay more than $10 for History Of The World In Two Hours 3D only because it wasn't even 90 minutes and they said that phrase about 112 times.  Add another $15 for WWII3D only for the few shots in 3D we got to see and some nice info.  The other $10 would be for Titanic 100 Years in 3D because its basically bonus features from other releases and since i have all the other releases I felt ripped off in a big way.  So  when you add those up its $35 and one guy has it new for $35.97.  So i gave it 5 stars just because its a deal on content.  Or you can wait until these are on TV and tell your TV to convert it to 3D...its about the same depth.  nothing special.",1355097600,6,847,3.877906976744186

5170704,1,B008NNY9TE,"I bought this DVD to build our collection, we love to learn and also enjoy the 3D experience, seemed like a win-win.

I haven't watched the Titanic or WWII (I may update my review later), but the History of the World in 2 Hours is so full of evolutionary fairy tales.  The whole thing is about proving evolution.  I expected to get a few minutes of evolution because that is what is accepted mainstream, but then get an overview on Ancient civilizations, delve into the Minoans on Island of Crete, the rise of Greek empire, Babylonians, Assyrians, perhaps rise and fall of Roman Empire, Middle Ages, Modern Era.  That The History Channel can get away with this reveals that we are de-evolving.  It doesn't even say, ""it is a theory,""

They say that we get all our minerals on earth from various sources in the universe that had to come to our planet earth, like Supernovas exploding (how do they know this??); that the moon was created by a meteor hitting the earth and ripping off some of the earth and that eventually smoothed into a nice round sphere (nice 3D computer simulation!); that O2 wasn't plentiful until later created by bacteria eating iron in the ocean.  That people spread throughout the continents 20,000 years ago (human fossil record is very speculative and sparse for recording that early, I would say more likely non existent).  The fairy tales go on and on and on throughout the whole show.  It mentions natural resources, but how all that came from their theories.  Like I said, if they said it was a theory, that would be more honest.  They think YOU are STUPID and that because they say this stuff you'll accept them as an authority.  I am forgiving of a little bit of evolution, but this is propaganda to dumb you down.  Don't expect to be educated for this program.",1419638400,3,1792,4.59748427672956
5170705,5,B008NNY9TE,A great collection for a great Price. Worth it every penny. Enjoy 3D :),1417737600,,71,4.142857142857143
5170706,1,B008NNY9TE,"""The History of the World in 2 hours""  When they interviewed people there was prominent ghosting.  I have come to the conclusion that the ""History"" series of 3D movies are poor in
the 3D department.  All of my IMAX 3D movies have incredible 3D quality.

The Titanic was very boring with ghosting and we couldn't even get through the DVD.  They kept showing the same things over and over and used cheesy graphics.  We didn't watch the WW2 movie.

When I bought it I thought I was getting a good deal because all three movies add up to 179 minutes or almost 3 hours.  However I regret buying this series and would much rather have purchased an IMAX 3D movie that is 45 minutes for the same price.",1414713600,12,694,4.3671875

5170709,5,B008NNY9TE,"I loved all three discs in this set.  In 3D it is spectacular.  I had no idea that the Germans utilized 3D stereoscope photographs and even one video during the war.  Still though, I was captivated by the History of the World in 2 Hours.  To learn about how everything led up to this point in time is amazing.",1399248000,8,309,4.186440677966102
5170710,4,B008NNY9TE,"Nicer in 3D than if it was 2D. The WW2  disk is real nice, as is the Titanic disk. History was ok, but some of the content wasn't as spectacular as I would have liked. Still worth the price for the set of 3 DVD's.",1395878400,2,213,3.7333333333333334

5170712,4,B008NNY9TE,"With most 3D productions-- ""Transformers"", ""Avengers"", ""Avatar"", etc.-- it feels like its purpose is to overwhelm the viewer, to cause you to involuntarily dodge and duck; but with two out of the three productions here, ""WWII"" and ""Titanic"", for my first time, it seemed the purpose was to make what you were looking at ""more real"". Seeing Hitler preen in his 3D stills, and the ghostly wreck of the Titanic miles beneath the sea literally brought their presences into my living room-- disturbing, yet fascinating, and only achieved through the 3D effect.",1385596800,2,555,5.043478260869565
5170713,4,B008NNY9TE,Subtitles in spanish and english. Great documentaries. For me this is a collection that would definitely fall into my best 3D documentaries. The 3D effects of Titanic are incredible. They make it with real 3D cameras and is under the water. Wow! I don't know that the nazi make a 3D propaganda movie and you will see this movie here and it look real real... Three time wow. You have to buy this if you love the 3D movies like me.,1383868800,,429,4.308641975308642
5170714,2,B008NNY9TE,"I like the war documentals with neutral and historical facts, this is a anti german propaganda. I not a nazi but I know about wwI II history. the explanation is with a strong tendency and not with historical true.",1373328000,4,213,4.487179487179487
5170715,4,B008NNY9TE,"This three disc set was very visually appealing and a good job of converting it to 3D was evident.  It was definitely worth what I paid for it.

However; with the introduction of reasonably priced home 3D televisions over the last three years, there is still not enough content for my family and myself to use this technology more than a couple of times a month.  There is Wealth-3D channel on Roku for $20 a year subscription and it's worth the money but I just wished they would produce the top movies for consumer 3D TV viewing.  Complete sets of the following movies in 3D would be outstanding too: Spiderman, Batman (The Dark Knight series), the last six of the Star Wars movies and others.

Unfortunately, when I purchased this set, I couldn't find exactly what each of the disks were.  Consequently, when I received it, I had already purchased one of the three discs in the set, which by the way are:
1) History of the World in Two Hours - previously purchased.
2) Titanic - 100 years in 3D
3) WWII in 3D",1366156800,37,1011,4.437837837837838

5170717,4,B008NNY9TE,this movie was interesting to say the least. I enjoyed watching it plus things learned were fun too. History 3D is worth recommending,1357603200,10,133,4.826086956521739
8529182,2,B008NNY9TE,"Guess I was expecting a world history lesson of the rise and fall of world civilizations and artifacts in 3D. Instead, this is a long video that assumes that evolution is true and that all of the history of our planet that has never been observed are all factual with precise dates and everything. It does not try to prove any of it, but states hundreds of events and event dates as facts when nobody saw it. In reality, it is all speculative and each item is placed on an evolutionary timeline based on assumptions, not facts. Nearly every event and its date are speculative and is open to modification as other data is presented. The 3D is top notched and fun to watch, but I felt the authors of this video are forcing their unprovable beliefs on the next generation of people who may just except it because of the nice music and high quality 3D. I felt the evolutionary videos are a bunch of propaganda very similar to the quality of Hitler's propaganda before and during World War II. I felt like I was being brainwashed and that is why I gave it two stars.",1524614400,,1061,4.3908629441624365
