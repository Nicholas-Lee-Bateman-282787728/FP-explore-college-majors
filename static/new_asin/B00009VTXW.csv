7993331,5,B00009VTXW,"Two excellent videos ""I'm Glad"" which is a flash dance type feel but Jennifer Lopez actually does the dancing unlike beals in film.""I'm Glad"" is a beautiful well done video almost like a mini film. Than 'All I have"" with LL Cool J great chemistry in video,another great video. I wish more artists did this for some of their popular songs because a lot of us love videos and it takes them forever to release them, if at all.",1284595200,,423,4.367088607594937
7993332,5,B00009VTXW,"Unlike other reviewers I'm not going to blather on about the music, because frankly, I don't believe guys buy this item for the music.  They buy it for J-lo's booty!  And as a guy, I have to say I'm very satisfied and happy Jenny from the block decided to remake the famous Flashdance video.  My hat's off to you, Jen!",1194566400,4,318,4.266666666666667
7993333,5,B00009VTXW,I LOVE THIS VIDEO IT SHOWS OFF HER TALENT. GREAT VIDEO.,1179187200,4,55,4.090909090909091
7993334,3,B00009VTXW,"On its own, the ""I'm Glad/All I Have"" DVD single is not a bad proposition:  If you like these two songs and/or videos this is a fairly inexpensive way to enjoy them.  However, if you are even remotely a J.LO fan I have to recommend ""The Reel Me"" DVD/CD combo--IT CONTAINS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF J.LO'S VIDEOS TO DATE (NOV 2003)!!! I made the mistake of buying the ""I'm Glad..."" single only to discover a few days later that ""The Reel Me"" was available for only a few dollars more.  In addition with it you get Jennifer's own commentary for every video and a behind the scenes making of special.  I strongly recommend it over this DVD single.
Having said that, Jennifer's homage choreography in ""I'm Glad"" to Jennifer Beals dancing in Flashdance is really epic and a great way to honor a movie (and of course the Fame TV show which it spun of) that had a very strong influence on many young dancers like Miss Lopez.  If you don't own a copy of Flashdance, you may want to get a copy of that so you can see how well J.LO covers the significant dance routines from the movie on this video, it's awesome!  The ""All I Have"" video is nothing special, it is the typical boy in his own world/girl in his own world breakup montage video:  It's been done before.  But it is nice to see and hear Jennifer working with an _established_ rapper like LL Cool J as opposed to the newer rappers she's been featuring like Ja Rule.  LL's flow on this song is as smooth as ever and delivered in the powerful yet cool way only a veteran like him can.  ""I'm Glad/All I Have"" on it's own merits I think is 3 stars, but since ""The Reel Me"" is also available, from a value standpoint this DVD single really deserves to be rated lower on the scale.",1069372800,9,1719,4.277777777777778
7993335,2,B00009VTXW,"There are just so many artists that actually try to sound the exact same as they did back a few years ago. Still, there are so many of them that really aren't taken as real, credible singers in the industry today. In the case of Jennifer Lopez, she is our current Latin Milli Vanilli. Sometimes when it comes to her music videos, you know they can be strong and certain-minded, but not all that good. Sometimes that power of the music video can really change the whole pattern of things. Unfortunately, I just wish I could say that same thing with music.
This DVD collection contains two videos the so-called J-LO created. The two videos were promotional for her album This Is Me... Then. The first one I'm Glad, was mainly as a recreation of the Flashdance movie, as if Jennifer was really in it. Not really. The concept was directed by David LaChapelle, who directed the recent video for Try It On My Own by Whitney Houston. Although Jennifer's video was similar to Whitney's, it doesn't seem to strike a chord musically, but it did remain somewhat eye-popping for the dancing only. Still, I thought it was very dissapointing.
The second video, All I Have was not even close considered as a duet with rapper LL Cool J. The song really didn't showcase any chemistry when chemistry was actually due. Still, I was very dissapointed that a strong credible rapper could stoop so low. The video was directed by Paul Hunter, who directed several videos Jennifer before, including If You Had My Love and Waiting For Tonight, when she was looking like a real credible singer. Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same thing for her career. It just doesn't add up.
Although Jennifer is a good actress, she does act very good in trying to prove she is not a real singer. Hopefully, she could try taking a lesson from Vanessa Williams and do Broadway or something. The video seems good, but if you can't sing in front of people it is worthless and not worth merit. Maybe Jennifer Lopez might still want to back to the Bronx for some lessons in singing.",1061164800,2,2043,4.584699453551913
