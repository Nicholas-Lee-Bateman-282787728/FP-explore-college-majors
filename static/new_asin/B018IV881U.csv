8746955,3,B018IV881U,"This is a curate's egg. The gala interlude is 5* as you would expect from such a stella gathering of Sutherland Pavarotti and Horne. But Die Fledermaus is over hyped and rather tedious. And the archive clips in the preface so crudely ""cut and paste"" that the irritation detracts from the enjoyment of the performances. So overall a disappointment. A DVD/Blu Ray purchase like this would for me normally get one viewing and then be despatched to the Charity Shop. For the moment I'll keep it - essentially for the 20 mins or so of the special gala. A missed opportunity though, really.",1450051200,,584,4.679611650485437
