8317781,5,B001LAGDM2,I love this version of Sleepy Hollow.  I have always liked Johnny Depp and what more perfect actor to portray the main character Ichabod.  I love the additions to the story it made for a more complete story.,1259280000,,207,4.421052631578948
8317782,5,B001LAGDM2,"Great price for the combo deal. Cloverfield is one of my favorite movies to use as demo material on my Home Theater system. Excellent movie for people with capable sub woofers.

Sleepy Hollow is also a great retelling of a classic tale. And is also a must see if you're into the supernatural genre and a Johnny Depp fan. However, the video transfer on Sleep Hollow was less than stellar. Kind of grainy.",1258502400,,403,4.52054794520548
8317783,4,B001LAGDM2,"Cloverfield and Sleepy Hollow, both blu ray movies for 1 low price! Sleepy Hollow is a classic! And Cloverfield is a fun new scary movie I saw in the theater, they're both def. a good watch, and you get both movies so its worthy of the 28 dollar pricetag!
you will get both seperate blu rays, they're just wrapped back to back together like a 2 pack. Worth the buy, cause seperately they're more expensive",1232755200,5,405,4.413333333333333
