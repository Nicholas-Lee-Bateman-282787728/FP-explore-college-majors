she'd like a DVD of kids doing Tai Chi but she just wasn't into it.",1383004800,2,160,4.0
7794613,3,0975200348,"This is a decent tai chi video out of the few that are available for children.  It has both a male and female instructor, but it's just not professional video quality. My five year old daughter became easily bored with it.  She was introduced to Tai Chi from a Max & Ruby episode and requested a Tai Chi video for Christmas.  She seemed disappointed with it, but will still practice it if I do it with her.",1357776000,4,406,4.246753246753247
7794614,5,0975200348,"when I first saw a bit of this video I knew my grand-son's would love it. And I was right, their mother said that the 7 yrs want to do it every day. I am so happy that I purchased it for them. You are never too young or old to start doing Tai Chi. I would highly recommed it for everyone kids or no kids.",1264896000,10,304,3.621212121212121
