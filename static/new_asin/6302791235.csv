509816,1,6302791235,"Last June I had an operation and I was on morphine for several days. This movie could have been a weird dreams I had. It certainly isn't entertaining, intelligent, functional, or anything. It makes no sense, has no humor, has very little action, has no point and goes downhill from worthless. A few minutes into the movie, it turns into something else and has no explanation how it got there.

It reminds me of some of the stories I have heard of movie albums that were required under a contract even though the singer/band was fed up with the company. They come up with the absolute worst album they could come up with. This movie could fit into that category. It is painful to watch even a few minutes.

For the person who put this in the same category as Naked Gun, I disagree.",1111795200,,780,4.409722222222222
509817,1,6302791235,"Could someone tell me what this movie is about.  No one that's what  I though.  There is magic in this movie the person that does Jackie's voice must have swalloed helium before he did Jackie's voice, Jackie is there for two seconds the quality sounds awful and so do the gun shots and the back cover is not even straight.  so please DON'T REMIND ME OF THIS MOVIE AGAIN and for your sake DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1087430400,2,461,5.026315789473684
509818,5,6302791235,"Pay no attention to the naysayers here: Jackie Chan fans all. Luckily, I, who do not care a lick about the majority of Jackie Chan's movies, am able to give a completely unbiased review of this wonderful film. Truth be told, Chan's character is of almost no consequence -- indeed, his presence here seems to be something of an afterthought. The ""story"" (which makes zero sense) is about a ""fantasy mission force"", who are trying to do... something. Who really cares what this movie's about? The real point is to see one of the most bizarre films in the annals of world cinema. After James Bond, Snake Plissken, and Rocky Balboa are considered for a job having something to do with WWII (don't ask me what), a group of generals (among them Abraham Lincoln!) sends their fantasy mission force to break through enemy lines. Along the way, this fantasy mission force, which is made of thugs, robbers, and conmen, encounters Amazon warriors led by a tuxedoed playboy, a haunted house, and many other weird obstacles (mostly cribbed from other movies). The high points for me are the opening theme song and the final showdown, which is genuinely moving as each member of the fantasy mission force gallantly gives his (and her) life for the good of the Allied forces. There is little else to tell; you'll have to watch this movie to see just how weird it is. As I said before, I care not a drop about Jackie Chan, Hong Kong action cinema, or action cinema in general, but this accidental discovery has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. I hope to make films this great someday, as it balances all the great things about movies: it's surreal, action-packed, funny, and even suspenseful. Watch it if you aren't one of those square Chan-fans who insist their films have no purpose other than to show off ""fight scenes"" (I'm snoring already). Keep an open mind and you will discover a true gem of world cinema; trust me!",1082592000,8,1919,4.6304985337243405
509819,5,6302791235,"Seriously...  There are no words to describe the glory that is this movie.  From the bondage-clad Chinese-Nazis driving '60s-era cars to the absolutely unnecessary destruction of an entire village of Amazon women, this movie screams at you to hate it.  However, you cannot.  It is perfection.  It is like staring into the face of God and him telling you that you are his most perfect creation.",1081036800,3,393,4.893939393939394
509820,1,6302791235,"please do not make the mistake of buying this film. Jackie Chan is barely in it , there about 20 seconds of kung fu in the whole film and it has no redeeming qualities. Unwatchable drivel is the phrase which comes to mind ,I truly cannot express in words how poor this film is. To put it into context,the european song contest would seem good after watching this. If I could give this film no stars I would.",1079481600,2,407,4.230769230769231
509821,2,6302791235,"It is really hard to describe this film.
The movie starts out with a group of generals (one of them named ""Abraham Lincoln"") in Civil War era army outfits in the middle of Canada being attacked by the Chinese sometime around World War II.
It goes downhill from there.
The plot is a bunch of unrelated scenes held together by the pretense of rescuing the generals from the Chinese.  (And barely at that.)  It is as if someone had grabbed scenes from a bunch of different films at random and filmed them.  (Which may actually be true, from what I have read about the film.)
Jackie Chan is in the beginning and end of the film.  The rest is left up to a cast of relative unknowns.
The DVD is not the greatest quality.  It is a pretty cheesy movie.  You are not going to make much sense out of it, but it is fun to show to your friends just for the confused looks on their faces.",1037750400,2,875,4.178571428571429
509822,1,6302791235,"The DVD was of a really poor quality. More like a badly scratched tape. The dialogues inaudible.
About the movie, the less said the better.
Jackie is there for only a few scenes. The whole movie is filled with insane happenings which one has no hope of understanding.
Best avoided",1018396800,,280,4.62
509823,1,6302791235,"Thsi movie is a complete waste of time and money for Jackie Chan fans. His screen presence is only a few minutes, in 2-3 scenes.
The story is obscure. Editing is poor. One cannot understand what is going on! Sound is poor with poor quality dubbing as well. picture quality is also worse than an old VHS tape.it is a complete waste.",1005004800,2,331,4.354838709677419
509824,3,6302791235,"Confused with the name of this title?  Then you'll probaby be even more confused with this movie.  The movie makes almost no sense, but is funny none the less.  It's full of skitsophrenic humor that can only be asociated with the asinine humor of the Naked Gun series.  With action, random humor, and even musical numbers, how can you go wrong?! I give this title 3 out of 5 stars, and a kudos to Jackie Chan for gracing the foriegn film industry with this haphazard adventure of slapstick escapades.

509835,5,6302791235,"This film is so bad its great!  This is not for people looking for a more typical Jackie Chan movie, but rather for affectionados of truly bizarre movies.  A potential cult classic.
This movie has everything-from agile Asian Amazons to a Mad Max at thunderdome type of scene where the bad guys chase the heroes in 70's vintage cars (this movie was supposed to take place during WWII)  Not to mention the haunted house . . .
I highly recommend watching this movie with a couple of friends, and perhaps a beer or two.",978480000,4,515,4.457446808510638

Chan  only appears in a few stunts (did as a favor to Jimmy Wang Wu) but was  billed as the lead. If you are looking for probably the weirdest movie  Jackie Chan has ever been it, then you've found it. Jimmy and his coherts  (one is Jackie Chan) battle aliens, Nazis, vampires, ghosts, and Amazons in  order to rescue world leaders that have been kidnapped by the Japanese.",966988800,3,517,4.457446808510638

With very little action and no story this is definately one you can live without. Also horrible picture  quality.

509839,3,6302791235,"Sometimes you just wonder how some movies get made.  In this film, the Fantasy Mission Force, a rag-tag team of commandos, must rescue a group of ""important"" generals (including Abraham Lincoln? ) captured by  the Japanese during WWII.  To do so, they fight Amazon women in China's  rustic outback, undead ghouls in a monster mansion, and the entire  East-German Demolition Derby Team.  This film is a campy romp that has  horrible dubbing, inane explosions, visceral swordplay, jokes that are  completely lost in the translation, and terribly underdeveloped characters.  In short, it's pretty fun to watch.  Just don't expect too much...",953683200,3,638,5.29

7830956,2,6302791235,"The devil made this movie for you. All kidding aside, Jackie Chan had a huge debt to pay to action movie star Jimmy Wang Yu. Chan repayed the favor by acting in Fantasy Mission Force(1984) and Island of Fire(1990). Taiwanese film director Chu Yen Ping made this out of whatever material was available. There's Japanese Nazis driving around in 1977 Camaros! Music from Planet of the Apes(1968) and Halloween(1978) is recycled in the film. The film borrows some ideas from The Dirty Dozen(1967). A motley crew of anti-heroes are recruited to rescue generals being held hostage by the Japanese during World War II. This movie is filled with anachronistic humor such as still photos of James Bond, Rocky and Snake Plissken appearing on a wall. Sam Raimi might be a fan of this movie. This movie is guaranteed to violate your goodwill! Jackie Chan's part in the film is really just an extended cameo. I like the scene where Brigette Lin uses a rocket launcher to blow up her house for no good reason. This movie is like The Dirty Dozen mixed with psychoactive drugs. This movie is a major guilty pleasure.",1522454400,,1100,4.734375

7830962,5,6302791235,"Before this movie, I thought I'd seen all that could be seen in the world of trash cinema. Grindhouse flicks, Japanese
""pink"" cinema, made-for-SciFi-Channel trashfests... all of these things, and more, had rendered me a jaded bad movie
o'phile. But one fateful day, I saw a copy of this disc (minus the case) for sale at a buy-1-get-2-free sale. I figured
I shouldn't buy it, but my buddy convinced me that if it had Jackie Chan in it, it HAD to be good. So, conceding, I
made my purchase.

 That night, after watching it, my life was forever altered.

 This movie takes the word ""bad"" and amplifies it to unrealistically huge proportions. This makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Warrior/dp/B000UVV2AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle Warrior</a>
look like a masterpiece of fine cinema. Ridiculous kung-fu, blatant use of copyrighted material (look for a guest appearance from
James Bond!), and a random scene in a haunted house, held together by some of the absolute worst acting you'll ever see in
a film and cinematography so hackneyed it must be seen to be believed.

 ""But wait, Elias, why are you giving this five stars if it's so bad?"", you ask? Because, my dear reader, while
this may be the furthest thing from a good movie, it's one helluva ride. I guarantee that, throughout the course of this
film, you will relentlessly entertained by the sheer absurdity of the situations Chan et al. encounter. Hell, you may
even be like me and find the climax of the film to be (gasp!) pretty damn good.

 For fifteen bucks, you can buy a lot of things; if you want to be entertained and amused for an afternoon while
hanging out with some buddies, use that money to get this film. You'll have a blast, and the film's existence may
help you in a triva contest one day.",1271030400,3,1821,4.967105263157895

Well, this demented film is trash of the greatest order, a movie so bad it's wonderful. It stars Hong Kong luminaries Jackie Chan (in a small role, despite its prominent billing role) and Brigitte Lin, and unlike Ed Wood movies, this film is deliberately bad, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining.",1166227200,,451,4.512195121951219
7830964,5,6302791235,"One of the best B-movies, crazy kung-fu, WW2-ish, fantasy. Truly bizarre plot, Nazis & Japanese attack; Canada? capture 4 generals - one from France, one from England, one from Africa, and one from America - Abraham Lincoln!, take them to Luxumboug! the army choses the captain guy to form a team to rescue them. Including the escape artist guy, the explosives guy, the old west Elvis impersonator guy, his psycho girlfriend, weird asian Scottish highlander guy, and his sidekick dressing in roman armor. Jackie Chan is a thief the team runs into and he helps - some. they are captured by Amazons, escape a haunted house, and finally have a show down with the 70's car chariot riding Nazis & Japs. Most everyone dies. Jackie revenges them. bizzare and sureal plot, quite a bit of good kung-fu action. lots of B-movie sets, and costumes. just great! taking it for what it is",1151971200,2,873,4.75
