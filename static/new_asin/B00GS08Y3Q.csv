6104986,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"This movie was a work of art, on every level. Words fail me.

 The whole production was off -the-charts high quality:  the cinematography, the music, the lush sets,the doomed beauty of the old manse and its glamorous inhabitant,  stellar acting from Geoffrey Rush, as well as a haunting, film noir story line that I will, truly, never forget. ( and OMG, who is this RUSH guy?  He is an ACTOR's ACTOR, of the old school...you can't see anyone else when he is on the screen !  )

The most surprising thing of all, for me, is that this type of movie  is not my usual fare:  I lean more towards the  pedestrian, like  Goodfellas, Steven Seagal stuff, Whitehouse Down, etc. so I am hardly a highbrow movie critic ( if you check out some of my other reviews you will see what I mean).  And restrained British drama is something I usually run screaming from.  So, if you are like ME, trust me, TRY IT....this thing is wildly interesting, romantic in a very weird way  and very well done.

And the messages it leaves you with, you will carry into your own life,  forever.

I felt bad that the American critics on other sites panned it, but it walked away with just about every award possible in Europe.",1388966400,,1194,4.4036697247706424

6105051,3,B00GS08Y3Q,This was good but could have been so much better. The problem with the story is that they spent so much time developing the love interest in order to gull you before the plot twist of it being an elaborate hoax to pull off an art heist that they left no time for revealing much about the heist at the end and it made it rather anticlimatic and make the plot twist a bit of a dud. For instance was his friend in on it as well he is the only one that knew of his collection yet how was he in cahoots with the Mechanical whiz did they know each other? If not how did the mechanical whiz kid find out about his collection? How did they get access to his house without nay staff noticing that was quite a bit to steal and cart away? The girl had her eyes close when he led her into his room though both the secret entrance and put in the keypad entry so how id they really know where it was and how did they get in? The beating suggested quite a few accomplices so her were they? All of this is left unanswered and makes the ending unsatisfying.,1507593600,2,1040,4.0048076923076925

Yeah, me neither.  Other reviewers are correct.  It is a beautiful film, stunningly acted (particularly by Mr. Rush), craftily written, and brilliantly paced.......UNTIL.....the movie takes an abrupt detour over the retaining wall.  Is it an amazing twist in the plot?  Yes. But it is also stupid, insipid, realistically impossible, wholly implausible within the framework of the movie, and shatters the previous parameters set up by the film itself.

Without going into detail, once you think of the money involved to set up the second movie and the uncertainty of making a profit, you realize how stupid the second movie is.

Geoffrey Rush plays a shadowy, stylish art dealer and auctioneer who is so stylish he always wears a vested suit and always wears gloves, even when he is eating. When he is called by 27 year old heiress Miss Claire Ibbetson, requesting an art valuation of an estate, a cat-and-mouse game is set off when he is given access to the estate. A curiously developing relationship, other entangled affairs, and an ingenious mechanical device combine to push this art movie house' mystery flick along to a completely unexpected ending, all framed by a wonderful music score by Ennio Morricone. Directed and written by Guiseppe Tornatore, it stars the Oscar, Emmy, and Tony award-winning Geoffrey Rush in a stupendous acting turn, along with Jim Sturgess, the comely Sylvia Hoeks, and the great Donald Sutherland.

6105122,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"You can probably count the number of films whose lead character is an art auctioneer on the fingers of one hand and have five fingers left over. Until now, that is. Noted Italian writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for romantic dramas like ""Cinema Paradiso"" (which won a Best Foreign Film Oscar), turns to the world of art, more specifically the world of art forgeries and shady dealings in ""The Best Offer,"" a film that will keep audiences guessing until the end.

The art auctioneer in question here is Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush), who in addition to heading a major auction house, is the world's pre-eminent expert in art forgeries, frequently being called in to determine whether a seeming masterpiece is genuine or not. What the art world doesn't know is that Virgil has used his status to acquire a personal collection worth millions. His method is simple: declare a prized painting a forgery, auction it off, and have a confederate Billy (Donald Sutherland) buy it for a relatively small amount and then turn it over to Virgil. Virgil keeps his collection in a vault so only he can admire these masterpieces at his leisure. His collection isn't Virgil's only quirk however. He's also a germophobe and emotionally detached from the entire world except for Billy and a young clock repairman, Robert (Jim Sturgess).

Virgil's life becomes complicated when a young woman commissions him to catalog her parents' collection following their death. The family mansion resembles a gigantic second hand store with art and knickknacks strewn all around. One thing, however, catches Virgil's eye, some oversized gears and other mechanical parts. As he searches the mansion, Virgil discovers more parts and soon realizes that the mansion may have housed an extremely rare 18th century automaton, a mechanical woman that, if intact, would be nearly priceless. So, he continues to catalog and search the mansion while he and Robert assemble the automaton. Virgil also discovers that Claire, the young woman who hired him (Sylvia Hoeks), has been a recluse at the mansion for years, an extreme agoraphobe who hasn't set foot outside following a severe trauma in her youth. Virgils curiosity about Claire eventually turns into love as the two socially backwards people form a bond.

Of course, there's much more to the story that this, but to say much more about the plot would spoil it. ""The Best Offer"" is the type of movie that's filled with twists and turns that are positively Hitchcockian. Indeed, Tornatore seems to be channeling movies like ""Vertigo"" and Otto Preminger's ""Laura"" here with two women of mystery, the real life heiress and the centuries-old automaton, casting their spell on Virgil. This is Tornatore's first English language film, and his script is filled with subtlety and hidden context. Many viewers will want to see this one more than once to see what they probably missed the first time, and the ending is tantalizingly open ended.

What really makes ""The Best Offer"" work, in addition to its dazzlingly intricate script, is Geoffrey Rush's performance. He avoids any temptation to overplay the role and instead comes across as an outwardly cultured, urbane man whose insecurities and emotional immaturity are always just below the surface. Virgil is twice the age of Claire, but there's no suggestion of lechery in his attraction to her, and the romance develops credibly.

The Best Offer had only a miniscule theatrical release in the United States and hasn't fared much better on home video, but it was widely acclaimed in its native Italy, winning several David Awards (the Italian Oscar), including Best Picture and Best Director. The film certainly merits its praise. The Hitchcockian touches extend past the script and direction to the lavish technical values, including a brooding score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The Best Offer ends with a haunting final shot; that shot, and the movie itself, will stay with viewers a long time.",1458518400,,3977,5.084226646248085

The cinematography, the sets, the artwork, the costumes: are all beautiful and have depth and texture. Geoffrey Rush carries the film, but the other minor characters adequately fulfill their roles. The real star of the film is the artistic texture, the way the architecture and the design is lit and photographed. There are quite a few successful locations, which are presented so well that we almost don't notice how perfectly they are achieved. The auction house, as a recurring visual, establishes the perfect routine of the main character. His home also continues that mindset. His private vault cements the already established perfection. Then, the mansion...It has it's own ambience of decay and mystery. Endless, interesting rooms, artwork, murals, odd wall curvatures, stairways up and down... breathtaking. The cafe across the street, a little bit of regular life with regular folks and one wacked-out freak that begs to be explored and explained. All of these elements are combined and presented perfectly; the scenes almost Kubrick-like in their finesse and exposure. I was amazed to find any less than perfect reviews. Those critics seem to have ignored or not noticed all of the ravishing visuals that I have alluded to. They also seem to have already known the intricate plot; somehow their prior knowledge made them oblivious to the great film-making that they missed. The film is also very emotional, and dredges up some universal fears about hope, expectation, loneliness, friendship, obsession, covetousness. I personally found the ending to be perfectly poetic and intricate and sad... but realistic",1451952000,5,1767,5.225352112676056

6105145,4,B00GS08Y3Q,"You have to appreciate not only certain kinds of films but certain kinds of art to be enamored with ""The Best Offer"". Like a renaissance portrait which needs to be slowly contemplated over a period of time to understand, ""The Best Offer"" is a rather slow-moving but atmospheric mystery-romance where all the pieces don't fall into place until the very end. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding in a tour-de-force performance along with a solid cast to match, including Donald Sutherland and the young Sylvia Hoeks. The film bombed in the United States and did only modestly well in Europe to regain back its $20 million budge. That said, this may be a film which will discover an audience in years to come.

Virgil Oldman (Rush) owns a prestigious art auction house in an unnamed city in Europe. His house obtains some of the best works to be sold for the best clients to bidders who have more disposal cash than many cities around the world, not to mention entire countries. In addition to his outward standing as a respected art auctioneer, Oldman has a secret obsession. He loves portraits of women from all artistic eras, from the Early Renaissance to the early 20th century. However, some of the paintings he covets would be too expensive for him to buy, assuming they are evaluated correctly, and a few of them come into his auction house.

In auction parlance, ""the best offer"" refers to the bidding scenario for an art object or artifact which has no reserve. In other words, no matter how low the highest bid received, the bidder will win the item regardless, be it $20,000 or $200, the minimum being only the announced opening bid. By contrast, in a reserve auction, bidders must meet a designated reserve price on an item so designated else the item will not be sold. To obtain paintings for his private collection that even he wouldn't be able to afford, Oldman has a side scam with his friend Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland), a competent painter who lacks artistic vision. When a multi-million-euro portrait painting comes into the action which Oldman desires for his collection, he misevaluates the painting as being not the work of a true master but only a lesser artist from the same period, meaning it would be worth only a fraction. The lot then comes up during one of his auctions, and he announces ""best offer"" before starting the bidding very low. Unbeknownst to the clients and the bidders, Whistler's task is to bid on and win the designated painting Oldman desires for his private collection. Whistler then in turn, sells the painting back to Oldman for a nice profit, and the auctioneer places his new acquisition in a secret room filled portraits of women from the ages. Essentially, Oldman has defrauded those consignors depending upon him for a fair evulation of their works. We eventually learn early on that Oldman and Whistler have been playing this game a long time.

Then Oldman and the auction house receive a strange phone call. A woman named Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks) claiming to have a huge collection of art, paintings, artifacts and books in a large old house desires Oldman and his auction business to sell off the items. They make arrangements to meet and settle the terms of the auction-sale, but she always misses the appointment, often claiming car accidents. For about the first 50-60% of the film, we only hear Claire's voice but we never see her. Eventually, Oldman learns she's a young woman heiress having lived in her house, an old-style Italian villa, maybe circa the 19th-century, for many years after her parents died. She refuses to be seen because she suffers from agoraphobia, the fear of social situations and open-spaced environments. She stays in a tiny room within a room inside the large house.

At first Oldman is put off by the situation but eventually becomes intrigued both by the art and artifacts in the house and Clarie's psychological illness. He also finds strange pieces of gears throughout the house, and he brings them to a mechanics specialist, Robert, who determines they are from an 18th century automaton which was used to tell fortunes in the 18th century. Oldman decides to bring the pieces to him to reconstruct the automaton. As the story progresses, not only does Oldman wish to auction off the artwork and artifacts, he wants to see Claire in person. He, in short, begins to fall in love with her.

This is a very interesting film, and highly original. It is slow-paced, and even around 2/3rds through it I became a bit impatient and wanted it to pick up the pace. Eventually it does, and the last quarter of the film is worth the initial three quarters. Rush is outstanding as the aloof and austere auctioneer who begins to come out of his shell because of Claire. Sylvia Hoeks is also outstanding as the heiress-recluse who at first is distrustful of Oldman but eventually begins not only to trust but even like him. While this film is not for all tastes, if you like art and slow-paced mystery, this film is quite compelling.",1450656000,,5011,4.78175519630485

6105148,1,B00GS08Y3Q,"This movie almost made it but has several inexcusable flaws. (The audio engineer deserves an award, however, just great.)

1.) The two elderly male leads need to be 10 years younger

2.) The ""dollmaker"" can just be totally eliminated; he's just an absurd device and the scenes kill the flow.

3.) Both names of the mystery person who linch-pins the plot at the end must be made clear.

4.) The signifigance of the final scene is lost; I think there may have been a single comment presaging it, but it was lost on me, and needs more amperage.

5. The ending was quite predictable and almost boring---I mean, what else could it be? As such, it needs an additional twist, to satisfy.

While this film was otherwise good, with vast possibilities (""good"" as in maybe three stars), the above solutions would render it five stars  :)

6105181,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"This movie has haunted me for over 24 hours and I fear it might drift through my mind every time I see a woman's portrait. Virgil played by Rush is a self-made eccentric. He's runs an exclusive auction house. His world is controlled, regimented, and sterile. He's never made love to a woman. Not since he was a child enjoyed the tactile sensations from touching objects, as he always wears gloves. Only to gentle stroke the brush strokes of a painting does he take them off. His home is part museum, part villa, and as he himself says, 'more like a hotel'. He is also somewhat of a con man. Probably too harsh a word, but at times when he sees a particular painting he wants, he tells patrons their paintings are forgeries. When in fact they are real. He does this to drive the price down so he can acquire them and tuck them into a vault where the portraits of women look down upon him adoringly.

Virgil receives a call from Claire Ibbetson requesting he evaluate the artwork in her villa. Her parents are dead and she needs to sell the items. Virgil does not meet with the public, but there is something in her voice which intrigues him. She doesn't show and he's left standing in a rain storm outside the boarded up villa. When she calls again, he's enraged, but she once again intrigues him. As the story enfolds we learn she never leaves the villa. She's afraid of face-to-face interaction.

One step at a time, Virgil helps Claire enter the world, and in the process Virgil learns what love is. Unfortunately, all is not how it appears.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. I will say that in the end I think Virgil, at least for a while, truly lived.",1439251200,,1675,4.396774193548387

But the ending I had figured out was not quite the actual ending of the film, but the extra few minutes were pretty pointless, even the sex scenes added nothing except you knew they were necessary as part of the raison d'etre of the film, but believable or convincing it was not.
The histrionic scenes were also not believable, so was that good acting or poor acting - who knows ?

Although myself and others obviously worked out what was going to happen such a complicated plot simply has no credence.

A touch of elegance a good film does not make - this was not Hitchcock, more like a parody of how not to make a mystery film.",1431043200,2,1054,4.142156862745098
6105201,4,B00GS08Y3Q,"""The Best Offer""(2013) is directed by Guiseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso). This is a romantic thriller about an auctioneer, Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush), who is obsessed by the beauty of the female face in old portraits. He has used his position and knowledge to manipulate the sale of auctions to his favour in which he has acquired expensive paintings at substantially lower prices than their real market value. When a mysterious woman who refuses to show herself decides to sell off her rich estate he falls for a trap. This is an intriguing movie surrounded by art, passions, obsessions, and double crossings. This movie explores the follies of obsession, trust and deception, as Geoffrey Rush's character, who seems to always be in control and deceiving others, in the end gets deceived himself. The movie is wonderful for its pace and flavour of antiquities and art and intrigue though it does ring a bit false for me that an astute, and deceptive man like Virgil could be so gullible that alarm bells wouldn't be going off in his head when he discovers that the woman is so young and beautiful and living alone in a house with so much wealth, and that she would actually fall in love with him, but I suppose such is blindness when one is obsessed.",1429056000,,1256,4.76605504587156

6105206,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"This stars one of the most underrated actors of this generation. He is a classic actor, a wonderful talented man and is able to hold the viewer. He is able to capture the emotions of pure brilliant acting. He makes the viewer believe his characters. His character in this one is all the same. He grabs it, owns it and displays it for the viewer. I speak of none other than Geoffrey Rush.

Geoffrey Rush stared in one of my favorite films about the piano legend David Helfgott in the wonderful powerful 1996's Shine. He did win his Oscar for the performance and he deserved it greatly, for it was no mistake giving him the trophy.

Geoffrey Rush plays Virgil Oldman in this crime mystery drama about a man who becomes somewhat of a stalker or more or less obsessed with this hidden away in a mansion willing to sale her precious items of fine artistic value.

After seeing this, I don't know how I missed this and I don't know how I did not include this on my top films of 2013. This is a brilliant artistic film that is top of the top of filmmaking, wonderful thick story of acting and drama. A great mystery truly brilliant for the viewer to be hold.

This film is clearly created by an experts touch. Written by an experts touch. Filmed by an experts touch and most of all acted by experts. This is a film that stands out above and beyond many films that came out in 2013. Its better than some of the ones getting all the raves. I am truly shocked that this one did not make its mark and did not succumb to the raves and chants of cinema fanatics, for this is a standout film and a standout acting drama mystery.

This deserved to be nominated for best picture. Geoffrey Rush deserved to be nominated for best actor. Shame on the Oscars for not accepting this as best foreign film or best actor.

6105281,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"This is an Italian made film that is entirely in English. It stars, the sublime, Geoffrey Rush as Virgil Oldman who is a top rate art auctioneer and art expert. He is also a player and a collector. One of his games is to have a ringer in the audience to bid for items that he has deliberately mis represented so that they go for a fraction of their worth, and he gets to add them to his private collection. This man is played by Donald Sutherland.

Then he gets a phone call from a young woman who wants to sell a house full of fine art and she will only let him do it. She is veiled in mystery, being a recluse, but the collection whets his appetite. Soon he becomes obsessed with her and her collection, but things start to look like they are not adding up and as the time passes you start to question some of the players motives, the title it was released on in the UK was `Deception' and that gives a big clue as to what is really at the centre of things.

Original title `La migliore oferta' and it runs for just over two hours, but this is a sumptuous production, with beautifully framed and shot scenes so the two hours float past. The art too is exquisite for the most part and at one point Virgil says `art needs an inner mystery', a sentiment I whole heartedly agree with. Some may think that a good film needs something of a mystery too and if that is the case this one certainly scores highly- easily recommended.",1415491200,3,1425,4.197080291970803

I was believing the story at first but that room with untold millions worth of paintings had me wondering. For such a snob he looked odd eating with n chumming with the skilled mechanic. I really am not clear on the automatrons significance. However the group plot/ robbery still surprised me and the very end was so humiliating for that wealthy,art expert. It makes one have lingering thoughts. you do have to see it a second time to relish the mans wealth and follow the spider 's weave her web..

6105324,4,B00GS08Y3Q,"Giuseppe Tornatore's film is basically a heist movie in which affluent auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) is systematically fleeced of his precious art collection by means of an elaborate plot involving impersonation, scientific mumbo-jumbo and a great deal of thoroughly convincing play-acting from Oldman's so-called 'friends' such as Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland).

Thematically speaking, THE BEST OFFER is a study in alienation.  Despite his success in his chosen career, Oldman cannot bear to get close to anything or anyone.  He wears leather gloves to touch the objects he so obviously values, and finds it difficult to communicate with everyone - even his close friends.  He spends much of his time sat among his pictures, which occupy almost all of the wall-space in his strongroom, their faces gazing down impassively on him.  All the pictures are of women of various cultures and ages; for Oldman they are his friends, even though none of them can respond to him.  When he finally gets to communicating with a real woman, the elusive Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), he does so through a locked door - an appropriate visual metaphor for his personality defects.

When Claire deigns to appear in front of him, Oldman cannot do much other than to gaze at her in scopophilic fashion, almost as if he wants to possess rather than love her.  There are several sequences in the film where he shown staring at her clothes, her hair, and her naked form, as if she were one of the art-treasures he spends much of his life trying to value and collect.  Director Tomatore does not want us to sympathize with him; rather he represents Oldman as someone so in love with himself (and his status as a high-society auctioneer) that he never stops to consider his personal life.

The film ends with a long shot of Oldman sitting alone in a Prague caf&eacute;, ordering food and drink and waiting for someone who never comes.  The camera tracks backwards, showing several couples left and right happily talking to one another, but focusing intently on Oldman's impassive face.  He is doomed to live a life of perpetual loneliness, something for which he is almost entirely responsible.

Geoffrey Rush gives a memorable performance in a difficult role.  Tomatore's camera focuses intently on his features in close-up, looking at every blink of the eye, or curve of the mouth.  For a lot of the time his face remains impassive, as if trying desperately to sustain the sang-froid he believes should be characteristic of someone in his profession.  We only understand the emotion lurking underneath through the blink of an eye, or the slightly longer glance at the door separating himself from Claire, or the lift of the head as he tries to listen intently to what she has to say.  The strain becomes too great for him; in a climactic sequence taking place during an auction, Oldman, his tie awry, his hair uncombed and his suit disheveled, tries desperately to continue the bidding while answering several calls on his cell phone.  Eventually the task proves too much for him, and he ends up giving the wrong description for one of the lots he is selling, much to the buyers' amusement.  His humiliation is complete - although he continues in his chosen career, he can never do so with the same degree of self-assurance as he had before.

Fabio Zamaron's lush cinematography captures the world of antiques; its obsession with surfaces, period detail and (most importantly_ money.  Everyone is out to cheat their rivals - and their customers - and are prepared to go to any lengths to do so.  In this kind of environment human emotions count for little; anyone wanting to find out something has to conceal themselves, either by role-playing or hiding behind ancient artifacts so that no one notices them.  Anyone watching THE LAST OFFER would be immediately skeptical if they listened to the valuers pronouncing judgment on popular television programs such as THE ANTIQUES ROADSHOW.",1410307200,3,3981,4.953383458646616

The beautiful masterpieces, the lush cinematography, the sensuous settings, even the simple soundtrack -- are all mesmerizing. But, watching Rush transform Virgil from a stuffy old crust to an excentric lover of life alone is worth the price of admission. Though Claire was lovely to watch, I admit that her ""angry voice"" was like fingernails across a blackboard (thank heavenn for ""fast forward"" during subsequent viewings). I was perplexed by Sutherland's small role, but of course, he pulls it off like the master he is. All in all, I was so deeply touched by the profound psychological undertones of all of the characters that I was completely caught off guard as the events finally unfolded.

6105378,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush in a brilliant portrayal) answers his working acquaintance, Robert, after being asked, ""Why did you never marry, never have kids?"", with what is written in the title.  He is a well renowned dealer, auctioneer and a personal collector of fine art and antiquities and has amassed a huge store of painted portraits with a specific provocative theme by sacrificing decades to intentionally lead a solitary life. The enormity of all this is best seen instead of reading too many of his personal reasons.  Virgil spends his time quite self-absorbed and with an indifference towards others whom he comes in contact with.  He indulges himself in a few eccentricities, such as his enormous, and meticulously kept, walk-in closet filled with fashioned pairs of gloves.  Virgil does not touch anything without wearing these which also aid in shielding him from absolutely any physical contact with others.  He dines alone, does not carry a ""mobile phone"", and enjoys only his own company. Basically, Virgil does everything he can to ensure people are always on the outside of his world.  There are only a couple people privy to him in any way; one is the neighborhood tinker-type shop owner, Robert (Jim Sturgess), who he brings in gadgets or mechanisms for appraisal even repair, and engages in an inquisitive banter.  The other is his long-term cohort, Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland), a quite interesting and useful fellow.

Virgil and Billy have an extensive history of working in tandem to drive up the price of a piece of art during an auction.  This may be if a particular piece isn't receiving high enough monetary bids then Billy goes on to privatize its sale for Virgil.  Aside from this, he prefers to remain alone, both non-involved and unfettered by any relationships.  He has no tolerance for tedious imperfections or daily happenings outside of what he alone desires, which mainly has to do with artwork.  Geoffrey Rush portrays this indignant and arrogant man with an air of complete superiority; it is written all over him and he wears it well.  His facial features smack of condescension while he's talking with anyone, even while someone may be doing him a favor.  During the beginning of the movie, one can see how easy he makes this all appear and how easy it is to not really care much about Virgil in return. But that is then ...

Everything begins to change when he finally accepts the phone call from the young and tenacious heiress, Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks).  She is relentless in her pursuit of him being in need of a valuation of the furnishings and some paintings at her villa.  This was all left behind after her parents passing.  She remains hidden from view of Virgil which causes intrigue to build in him.  Claire is quite lonely, a prisoner of her own home while suffering from agoraphobia and helplessly watching everything fall down around her.  Virgil apprehensively begins to work with the beguiling woman after secretly spying a hint of her actual loveliness without her knowledge.

Virgil soon finds that through her situations, phobia, and personal eccentricities, he is indirectly working on himself in a positive manner. Is his hardened heart beginning to feel again?  A very suspenseful movie at times, boasting meticulously photographed sets (Fabio Zamarion), written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, a work enfolds which is heart rendering, romantic, and quite shocking.  Including masterful storytelling, a mystery of entangled emotions starts to build and grow to the point of awe for the viewer; at least for myself.  There isn't a detail that is not shown as we experience some of the most visually and emotionally stunning scenes that have us contemplating the meaning behind the captivating ""Best Offer"".  Originally titled , ""La Migliore Offerta"", this is breathtakingly bold and beautifully done with an artistic masterstroke ...",1405296000,18,3913,5.057632398753894

Set in Italy but filmed in English, The Best Offer is a highly unusual and unusually interesting tale of two lost and hurting souls reaching out to one another for meaning and salvation. Or at least thats what it wants you to THINK its about. What its ACTUALLY about may be something else again.

A self-described old man incapable of love, the allegorically named Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) has kept pretty much the entire world - women included - at arms-length for his entire life. Hes a renowned, if not entirely scrupulous, art appraiser and auctioneer who has his entire mode of existence turned upside down when he meets a mysterious young woman named Claire (Silvia Hoeks) who pleads with him to come appraise the belongings in her home upon the death of her wealthy parents. The problem is that Claire, who has been a recluse since the age of 16, seems to be suffering from a severe case of Agoraphobia and will speak with Virgil only through a wall in the house.  Dismissive, even irritated at first, Virgil soon becomes obsessed with the faceless, disembodied voice that floats to him through the dusky halls of a lonely villa.

Virgil is so emotionally cut off from the world around him that, despite the fact that he is physically able to come and go, he is just as much a prisoner of his life as Claire is of her disease and of the decaying mansion in which shes chosen to entomb herself. Is Claire the unexpected someone who will finally provide that meaningful human connection that Virgil has avoided all this time? Or is she merely the vehicle through which he will finally be made to pay for the many professional transgressions hes committed over the course of his lifetime?

Rush carries almost the entire weight of this film on his shoulders, and he certainly shows he has the acting chops to see it through. Since Hoeks is largely off-screen for large portions of the movie, her task is a somewhat less arduous one, though her accomplishment is no less impressive for that. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland are also effective in smaller, yet highly significant, roles in the drama.

With a smart screenplay and lyrical direction by Giuseppe Tornatore, The Best Offer is a haunting, mesmerizing film that draws you into its world and keeps you guessing every step of the way till the big reveal at the end.",1404777600,,2342,4.7

Something obviously shady is taking place between the auctioneer and an accomplice at the auctionssome kind of cheat. But its cleverly and enticingly concealed. The movie begins with power, and it draws the viewer in.

The movie begins with mystery and an abundance of beautiful works of art. The visuals Rush encounters everywhere he goes are overwhelmingly rich. I was hooked at once, but it didn't last for long. The motif of the audible but invisible damsel in distress, neurotically whining away in some hidden nook of a villa packed with fascinating artifacts, wears thin after only a few scenes. And that recurrent motif is beaten to death. Finally, one feels, the screenwriter had a failure of imagination. A plot held tightly together at the beginning begins to meander and drift, and by the time I ejected the DVD, forty minutes from the end, the script seemed as if it had been written by a committee in a bar over a couple of pitchers of beer and a joint passed around under the table. The structure is loosely, or even accidentally, held together. The dialogue lacks the tightness that all fine films require.

The production designer created a fabulously detailed Geppettos workshop for the gear-head character. Its a feast for the eyes. But without a plausible and engaging plot, no cinematic feast can satisfy the viewer.",1403827200,4,1529,4.82824427480916

About the film:

Virgil Oldman (Rush) is an eccentric introvert, who is a well known and praised English art collector and auctioneer.
His distrust of people and arrogant nature lead him to have only two friends. One of them is an old artist (Sutherland) who frequents auction house where our hero works, and another one is a young artificer/fixer-upper (Strugess) to whom Virgil goes for all kinds of help.  Virgil's life changes drastically when one day he is asked to appraise art collection of a young woman whose parents recently passed away and left her an old mansion with bunch of old art and furniture. The young woman suffers from a strange human-phobia. She locks herself in a room and refuses to be seen by anyone.

For one he is a forger, himself, while sniffing out forgeries to remove from his high priced auctions. He schemes with a pal of his to get paintings he wants. He even pretends one is a fake only to lower the price for himself. It isn't that he wants to be rich by owning the original. He even has his pal bid top dollar for the auction bidding. It is that he wants the female portrait as he collects such portraits to hang in his hidden room. He sits and stares at his collection of women instead of experiencing them in real life. It is only fitting he meets up with a secretive loner like himself who, herself, hides in a room from the world among beautiful art. The guy even steals from her all the while falling for her. While you seem to be convinced she is who she claims to be you still wonder what his motives are as he is neither totally evil nor totally good.

Seemingly doesn't fit with the rest of the movie except that our central figure (auctioneer Oldman) is himself an unloved obsessive-compulsive automaton. Anyway, well disguised plot, even though about 80% through I thought ""No, this can't be one of those plot twisters."" which I quickly dismissed as too improbable given the background and challenges to pull it off.

Worth five stars for it's creative writing, acting, sets, certainly props and directing (the sound of the dropped painting, the empty room except for the ...),  but reduced for the following:
1. The implausibility of setting it all up without drawing notice; leaving a trace; no witnesses (well, one sort of).
2. The film limiting itself to only our central character's pov thus having an excuse to not have to explain all the immense logistical challenges, time frames and implausibilities. Also, not giving us any background on our other main characters and their outcomes.
3. The automaton appearing each day in pieces scattered about should have set off an alert investigative response from Oldman. Oldman, for his and his partner's intelligence, seemingly do nothing at the end of which there are many possibilities. Too weak!
4. With Oldman's character, even though he steals from people, one is left with either a dismissive feeling toward him or actually pulling for him. Since the victims are not seen and he gets away with it, it's acceptable capitalist look-the-other-way ethics.

Spoiler unresolves (read after seeing):

I also am REALLY tired and bored of these implausible relationships between aged men who aren't particularly attractive and women who are far too young for them. These male fantasies are just so ridiculous. I'd have found it far more interesting and realistic for the female character to have been closer to his age and experience. I think I get why the filmmakers might have made the choice of such a young woman, but seriously, are older, effeminate men this delusional that a woman like that would be remotely interested and physically attracted to them? Can we not possibly imagine that an older woman (who by no means is less beautiful, just more textured), could hold the same sway?

6105473,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"Best Offer is a rollicking experience that left me gasping for air and my heart paced so hard towards the end. Where do I even begin? The acting is brilliant, the music and the background music, the story, the sets, the calm with which this film is eased makes sure it is going to be REMEMBERED FOR MANY YEARS amongst it's own circles of fans. Is that a cult? Hardly.

PLOT -  There is an auctioneer that has everything going for him but he can't even shake a person's hands without a glove. He is in 60's apparently and although very affluent, he is dismissive, he doesn't have time to waste traveling from the UK to USA so he does business only locally. And then one day...

The film kept me thoroughly engaged and enthralled. I was at the edge of my seat most of the time. Geoffrey Rush delivers to me the performance I will remember him for the rest of my life for.

I should say so much more but I wouldn't even know much to let you know.

I suggest you watch this. There have been films I have liked more this year 2013 but none that I have given a perfect 10. That's how remarkable and impressionable this film is. Don't read any other reviews that speak of the plot and don't even look at the poster hard.

JUST WATCH.",1390867200,,1226,4.217948717948718
6105474,5,B00GS08Y3Q,I was so impressed with this movie.  A must see.  Kinda reminded me of the old Hitchcock flicks.  Loved it...,1390867200,2,109,4.35
6105475,4,B00GS08Y3Q,"""Best Offer"" (2013 release from Italy; 131 min.) opens with the character played by Geoffrey Rush reviewing someone's art work. He is Virgil, a highly respected art auctioneer and evaluator. One day he gets a call from a woman who wishes to sell the art she inherited from her parents a year ago. As it turns out, she is extremely reclusive, refusing to meeting in person. Now Virgil become truly intrigued. In a parallel story line, we see how Virgil, with the help of Billy (played by Donald Sutherland), scoops up art work on the cheap, in particular female portrait paintings. His collection is astonishing. Meanwhile, back to the mysterious woman (played by Sylvia Hoeks), we learn her name is Claire and she is 27, and possibly suffering from agoraphobia. It isn't until midway into the movie when we actually get to see her, when Virgil tricks her into coming out of her room. What happens from here on? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to experience it for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is another tour de force from writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for his film ""Cinema Paradiso"". The tone of the movie will suck you in almost from the opening scene, and as things play out and become weirder and yet more compelling, you just can't wait to see how it all plays out. Second, this is a towering performance from Geoffrey Rush, whom we just saw recently in ""The Book Thief"". He is in virtually every frame of the movie. Third, the orchestral score of this movie plays prominently and comes again from the legendary composer Ennio Morricone, yes he of those spagetti westerns from the late 60s. (Morricone has scored all of Tornatore's movies.) On several occasions the overall feeling of this movie reminded me of the first half of Brian de Palma's 1980 movie ""Dressed To Kill"", where we know things are not always as they seem and we delight into being 'duped'.

I am probably one of the few here who saw the movie in a theater. I recently saw it at the Coral Gables Art Cinema in South Florida on a huge screen, and with perfect audio. It made for an overall very satisfying viewing experience. The screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, even for a matinee. Bottom line: ""Best Offer"" is a charming mystery-thriller that will captivate you from start to finish. ""Best Offer"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater, on DVD/Blu-ray, or on Amazon Instant Demand. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1390435200,3,2536,4.735294117647059
6105476,3,B00GS08Y3Q,"This was a well-acted film, visually pleasing, and suspenseful, but the ending lacked the punch it should have had.

I'm stunned to find in the midst of other garbage coming from the film industry to find this rare gem, priceless antique; however, I must go on record that unlike some of the other viewers who rated this movie - the storyline, for me, was ""foreshadowing"" - you'd have to be an idiot if you didn't catch on by the cell phone call ""she"" received.

I am more forgiving with BEST OFFER - because it is at the end of the movie when a viewer can say to one's self ""yes, I feel your pain, I have been there and I WOULD DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  Be honest people, if you have ever had your heart broken - I mean truly broken - you are at the table with Mr. Rush doing the only thing you know to do.  BRAVO!!!!!!

6105501,5,B00GS08Y3Q,"Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore is highly respected for his films Cinema Paradiso, The Legend of 1900, Mal&egrave;na, Everybody's Fine, and here he opens a new realm to test his prowess - a story that is so well crafted that even after the film is over the resolution is not entirely clear: he respects his audience too much to make things completely tidy. It is rich in art, music, atmosphere, the underpinnings of the art auction world, phobias and more.

Master auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush in a magnificent performance), owner of a vast accumulation of famous paintings of women he hides in a locked room, becomes obsessed with an extremely reclusive heiress Claire (the stunningly beautiful Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks) who collects fine art and is living in a boarded up mansion left to her my her deceased parents. Claire suffers from agoraphobia (fear of strange places) which keeps her confined to her home: her only servant is Lambert (Dermot Crowley) who has never seen her. She refuses to be seen but hires Oldman to perform a valuation of her antiques and paintings and only speaks to him behind closed doors. Oldman has his own phobias: he has a huge selection of gloves he wears at all times, afraid of touching anything without their protection. Oldman also has a scheme with one Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) who attends Oldman's auctions and bids on art in a fashion that allows the two to keep the money private. Oldman also employs a young tinker Robert (Jim Sturgess) and feeds him pieces of mechanical findings from Claire's home: Robert is convinced the pieces when assembled will be an ancient android long lost to history books. Gradually Oldman spies on Claire, falls in love with her despite the enormous difference in their ages, and plans to change his life, and just when it seems their lives will change, the film takes a surprise turn which spins a spell with the audience and cannot be revealed in a review. Nothing is as it seems - so much of life is a forgery.

Tornatore is an inordinately sensitive writer and director and has graced this gorgeous film with a musical score (mostly women's voices) by Ennio Morricone. The cast is uniformly brilliant and it is very difficult to understand why this film has not raised a strong following. It is cerebral, intensely romantic, and fascinating on every level.

Every day is a new life. There is no limit on how many times you can start over in this life. That's why not many of us have any real excuses. Start over on any given morning.

6105510,3,B00GS08Y3Q,"The Best Offer is a film at once unique in its ingredients but familiar in its recipe.  I don't know... like a ""hamburger"" made with the rarest and best meats.  (That's a terrible analogy, but there it is.)  The film is both a satisfying bit of entertainment and a spotty attempt to reach a bit deeper.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but I don't have much extended praise to share.

As an art collector, artist, art historian, and somewhat of a shut-in myself the film speaks to me on several superficial levels. I utterly adore the subject matter, I still find it deeply interesting, but that isn't quite enough. The parts seem to be greater than the sum.

The world of buying, selling, and forging antiques has always been ripe for cinematic and literary imagination.  It's a great juxtaposition: beauty and malice. This film fits into that lineage as a relatively cerebral and mysterious fiction; that is not to say it's particularly intelligent or especially imaginative, despite its efforts to be both. Being cerebral -- that is, existing largely around the emotions and behaviors of the central characters, as opposed to blunt action -- can be just as dumb as an explosion or a car chase at every turn... minus the thrill and with the added peril of pretentiousness.

Done well, cerebral narratives are the best sort. They move us, but what's more, they offer explanations as to why we are moved in the first place. Unfortunately this film comes up short. At its core it's a basic heist drama and it winds up latching itself too faithfully to that metric. It's dressed in a promising and dizzying array of stops, starts, and meandering explorations of human nature but those are all just dressing for the same story repeated a million times. It's never particularly pretentious, although some aspects of the film grate the sensibilities: e.g. the bizarrely intelligent little person in the bar who serves as overbearing metaphor and narrative parallel; or the wealthy onlookers ogling at Virgil Oldman's gloves which he wears to protect himself from germs (gloves aren't odd, people wear them... why pretend otherwise?); or the fact that Robert appears to have a really great location for his tinkering shop but never seems to do anything... etc. But rather than embrace the stilted qualities of the main character, become mired in the melodrama of its risky plot devices, or succumb to the oft-vapid setting of the art and antiques world, the film is self-deprecating and critical enough of such things to be both party and convincing critic at the same time.  At moments the film is about much more than art or selling it/obtaining it; it digs to the core of the human qualities that make great art so lasting and so financially valuable.  But then it doesn't endeavor to illuminate its own findings.  The film stops short, or it holds back, or it doesn't understand what to do with its big, human ideas.  Perhaps this is why the disappointment is greater, for despite all of the careful construction the carry-through is so inevitable and anticlimactic that one begins to question what it was all for.

The acting and technical filmic aspects of the movie are strong. Geoffrey Rush is a superb actor and he brings life to every role I've found him in -- this one proving no exception. His character is unsavory, but vulnerable; he's unsympathetic, but we manage still to dig up empathy for his circumstances.

It's a movie about idiosyncrasies while managing itself to be disappointingly conventional. It's clear that the creators were aiming for more and they very well might have succeeded if they'd sacrificed a bit of style and convention. Like so many before it, The Best Offer is lost somewhere between style and substance... but the style is fun to indulge for the duration. It's a fine bit of entertainment, but sadly not much more.",1389052800,5,3849,4.838660578386606
8626499,3,B00GS08Y3Q,"Rush is great, as always, and all of the cast -- except for the lead actress -- were great. But the movie is overly long so it loses it's whole purpose -- which is the heist. And the lead actress is so unbelievably annoying and bland, that you wonder who would ever fall in love with her. In any case, the film would have benefitted greatly if they had edited out 30 minutes. It's visually beautiful, especially is you love art, but the length and wooden performance by the lead actress make it no better than three stars for me.",1525737600,,529,4.3
