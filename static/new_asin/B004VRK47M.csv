4483916,1,B004VRK47M,"I love Gary Burghoff and had he not been in this movie it would have been a total loss.  I'm not normally a critical person, but the ""acting"" in this movie was absolutely horrible!  I mean, really, really bad.  The dubbing was off at times, the lighting switched back and forth, and it was just too difficult to take the story serious when I couldn't see past the poor acting.  Mr. Burghoff did just fine, as one would expect from a real actor.
I believe in the premise of the movie and believe good things happen for those who follow God.  So many of these Christian movies do a disservice because the message is lost when one can't see past bad acting.  There has to be good actors available to put some believability into these stories.
I would not recommend buying this movie.  If a friend has it, maybe borrow it on a really slow day.  Not worth spending any money on I'm sorry to say.",1384473600,3,890,4.319277108433735
4483917,4,B004VRK47M,"I thought this was a great story line. The acting perhaps was shaky in some areas, detracting somewhat from the power of the story, but not enough for me not to like this - a lot (pardon the pun).  I know this follows a predictable plot line of troubled man gives his life to God and obeys Him - and blessings follow, so originality is not a major strength of the film. But who cares? Art should parallel life. There are plenty of witnesses to how God has blessed people for their faithfulness and obedience. It's a story that some of need to keep hearing over and over until it sinks in. The other part of that lesson we need to get, is that the blessings arrive in God's timetable, not our own.  I strongly urge you to see this film, but only if we want your day brightened.",1358035200,,776,4.201342281879195
4483918,3,B004VRK47M,"If only there were more professional acting actors out there who could carry off GOOD CHRISTIAN roles.  Radar did just fine...he's obviously a pro.... But the rest well.... I won't say they were all bad actors....but I will say they weren't comfortable infront of the camera.  Some acting lessons would sure help them!

The plot of the flick was fine. The scripting was fine.  Camera work was fine.  Radar, as mentioned was fine...
but those other actors.... did I say they needed lessons?

Cute movie.... for a dollar or two.....",1319932800,4,530,4.833333333333333
4483919,3,B004VRK47M,"I would recommend to watch if you need a boost in following God, or your faith, or your obedience when things may not make sense. It's a very sweet story. The acting needs a ton of work, as well as the producing itself. But a very good low budget, sweet movie about the power of God's faithfulness, prayer, and blessing in obedience. A bit slow at times, and some of the characters are hard to watch on screen. Again, worth the time, I think three star is appropriate for production/acting, and 5 star appropriate for the message on faith and obedience.",1507420800,,553,4.485148514851486
4483920,5,B004VRK47M,"It was a very good movie.  Showing all aspects of God:  His faithfulness, his forgiveness. His unconditional love, his desire for is too seek him even in the most difficult times.",1507075200,,179,4.741935483870968

Great Inspirational and encouraging film Thank You....,1506038400,,278,4.326923076923077
4483925,5,B004VRK47M,"The messages of trusting in God and salvation were very strong in this movie and kept me watching to the very end.  I did not get caught up in the characters as I do in other movies because I continued to be reminded that the cast was acting; but I also know that the cast are believers and that the message was the most important message that anyone could deliver to both believers and non-believers.  What could be more important than to make God number one in our lives, and to be obedient in telling others.  That is just what this movie did.  These believers, not actors, were true to their calling as Christ followers.  I am sure that fruits will follow from this movie as God was in it.",1505001600,2,693,4.3
4483926,2,B004VRK47M,"If I was sitting around bored out of my skull I might finish watching this. I like the idea of this movie. I love the Lord and hear from him myself.
I want to give this movie more stars but truth is the acting was sub par and I've seen better dubbing in an old kung fu movie.
The truth is the truth is lost in the delivery of this movie. When I come to movies like this I wonder how many souls don't hear the word because of it. How many will not watch a good movie because one like this turned them away. it's just sad.",1503964800,2,520,3.824074074074074
4483927,5,B004VRK47M,"A beautiful and heartfelt movie. There's nothing more beautiful than salvation, hearing God's voice and following his direction and guidance.",1502841600,,141,6.1

8443875,3,B004VRK47M,"I though the plot of this movie was very pertinent and compelling. Unfortunately I can't rate this movie highly because it was produced so poorly. I didn't have a problem with the acting, I thought the acting was fine, but the lighting, the audio, the editing, just very amateurish and made it too painful to sit through. A shame.",1521849600,,330,4.610169491525424
8443876,5,B004VRK47M,"Good message. I enjoyed the movie. The wife was terrible,  but she repented! Amen.",1520812800,,82,4.857142857142857
8443877,5,B004VRK47M,Probably one of the best anti-comedy films out there. My personal favorite detail is the corner lot downtown which is actually a large empty field between some farmland and some woods. Perfection!,1516406400,,196,5.15625
8443878,3,B004VRK47M,"Great storyline! If you need inspiration or need to believe again, this movie has a great story.  I disagree with the review that says if you can't make a great movie, don't make it all, because I needed to hear this message. Do I agree the acting was not great? Yes I agree, and yes that made some parts hard to watch. But I'm sure the actors were not paid much and perhaps they were a part of this movie because of the message and to give glory to God.  5 stars for the story.  God is good!",1515801600,,492,4.0
8443879,2,B004VRK47M,"The only thing that kept me watching this film was that I was interested in where the plot was going. The acting was absolutely horrible and so was everything else; the music was too loud, the camera work and theblighting was off, everything was bad about this, except the storyline. It was very nice, it had a very good message and I really enjoyed it, but I am very appalled at how all these Christian movies seem to be doing such a bad job of making films. Maybe they should just not bother. If you can't do something right then don't do it at all.",1515542400,,551,4.257142857142857
8443880,5,B004VRK47M,The messages of faith and trusting in God are all through this movie. It will help your unbelief. May God continue to bless others through all the different avenues He sends His messages. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.,1515542400,,216,4.564102564102564
8443881,4,B004VRK47M,This was a great story about trials and faith through those trials.,1515283200,,67,4.666666666666667
8443882,4,B004VRK47M,"Good story, Good points.  We have to forgive even though its hard.  It was sorted a Hosea  and Gomer story from the bible. It touched my heart that he took her back.",1513036800,,165,4.09375
