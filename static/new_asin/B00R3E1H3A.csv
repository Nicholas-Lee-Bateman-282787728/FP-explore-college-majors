This documentary really touches your heart and people can see how frustrating it was for Gay couples to not be able to marry. I'm proud of both couples for what they achieved. Loved this film.

6898126,5,B00R3E1H3A,"This documentary from the USA has already won awards at Sundance and SXSW, so we are happy to see it at the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the case to overturn California's ban on same-sex marriage (Proposition 8).

The American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) assembled an unlikely Dream Team:
  * David Boies and Ted Olson, who had previously opposed each other before the Supreme Court in the Gore vs Bush case. During the course of that intense time, they became friends. Obviously, Conservatives were NOT happy about this new pairing.
  * Kristen Perry and Sandra Stier, carefully vetted to represent mainstream couples: comfortable, employed, raising a family of four. They married as soon as it became legal in California, but their marriage was rescinded.
  * Paul Katami and Jeffrey Zarillo had refused a ""domestic partnership"" because they would be settling for a placebo which doesn't provide full marriage rights, e.g., Social Security and pensions.

There is a LOT of humor in this documentary. One activist said, ""If Ted Olson, Dick Chaney and the Cato Institute all endorse gay marriage, maybe I'm on the wrong side!""

Directors Ben Cotner and Ryan White stayed with this project for the five years it took to follow the case, film it, and edit it down to documentary length. Despite the complexity of the case, it is presented in easily assimilated bits. We found it satisfying and entertaining.",1419206400,5,1461,5.054166666666666

8693908,5,B00R3E1H3A,"This documentary shows the meaning behind Love is Love.  I live in a liberal, gay friendly community and yet I meet so many that think ""Gays are trying to shove their lifestyle down our throats"". No! They want what others have automatically because they are straight.  We often do not understand what is different from us. Watching this will show why gay rights are so important especially now under our current administration.

Love is love and the love you see in these couples will bring tears to your eyes seeing what they risked to win this fight for equality.",1488931200,,565,4.686868686868687

I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie or even finish it.  It is about the legal challenge to Proposition 8 in California, a proposition that prohibited same-sex marriages with the simple statement that marriage was defined as legal union between one man and one woman.  [Well it was something along those lines].

I felt a vague sense of discomfort that it was going to be a militantly pro-gay movie.  Not that theres anything WRONG with that, as Seinfeld proclaimed.  Butbeing definitely heterosexual, when Im forced to uh.viewuhpublic homoerotic making out, I grow tired quickly.  Heck we all know conservative people that don't even approve of HETERO sexual public intimacy, right?

Im pleased to say it was not at all like that.  Yes, there were two same-sex couples who agreed to be plaintiffs against the proposition.  Their legal proposition was that it was unconstitutional by violating their right to equal treatment and to due process under the law
Most bizarrely, they and a coalition supporting them were able to attract two extremely competent lawyers with experience arguing cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, who came from complete opposite ends of the political spectrum.  Reality trumps fiction again: its David Bois and Ted Olsonyesthe lawyers for Gore and for Bush respectively, who argued Bush v Gore in the USSC regarding the 2000 election.  I would love to rattle on as to why these two lawyers agreed to work the same case, the reaction from the gay and liberal communities, the legal meanderings of this case, the family situations of the plaintiff couples, the opposing legal team, and so on, but why spoil the film?
The case did have a meandering history: Federal District Court, 9th District Court of Appeals, over to the California Supreme Court, back to 9th Circuit Court and then on to the US Supreme Court, which bundled it together with a challenge to the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.  In its decision on the two cases the USSC struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on the grounds pled here: due process and equal protection.  It decided plaintiffs did not have jurisdiction in the appeal on Proposition 8, which left standing the lower courts decision that it too was unconstitutional.

The US Supreme Court in the last twenty plus years has been a very conservative supreme court  [though admittedly, it is the most conservative in defending the rights of the poor downtrodden corporation against individuals and has been somewhat more protective of individual rights against the state].  So its worth taking note of why this conservative court made what was a somewhat bold liberal decision.  This movie explains how, and why.  Very well done.  A-.",1452816000,,2760,4.941431670281996

8693915,5,B00R3E1H3A,"Brilliant documentary.  Although I knew the end, it was still completely worth traveling through the story with the heroes that fought for equality and fairness in the face the inexplicable ignorance and hatred of those that fought to hurt innocent families.  Fortunately its getting better, or at least no longer socially acceptable to hold bigoted homophobic views. I was not expecting to cry with joy.  I was not expecting to be so moved by all the brave, good people in this documentary.  Highly recommend for everyone.",1438214400,,523,5.046511627906977
