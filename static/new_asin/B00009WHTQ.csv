422 - The Apple Corps: Ash and company come across a woman trying to deal with a pack of Pichu stealing her apples!
423 - Houndoom's Special Delivery: Togepi is separated from Misty during a freak Teleport accident, but luckly a passing Houndoom takes care of the young Pokemon.
424 - The Tower Inferno!: Ash finally arrives at Ecrutek City, but finds it's Gym on fire!
425 - From Ghost to Ghost: Ash battles Morty for his fourth badge, but Morty's ghost Pokemon are almost unbeatable!
426 - Brewing Up Trouble: The kids attend an ancient tea ceremony, where Brock falls in love with four sisters and Team Rocket attempts to steal an Eevee.
427 - All That Glitters: A gang of Murkrow steals Ash's badges!
428 - The Light Fantastic: A mysterious light emerges over the desert.
These are some pretty interesting episodes and out of them, only one or two feel like fillers. The Apple Corps is a cute episodes, and Brock falling for four different sisters in the same episode in Brewing Up Trouble is hilarious. The two Gym episodes will more than satistfy hardcore battle fans.",1055894400,20,1169,4.7073170731707314
