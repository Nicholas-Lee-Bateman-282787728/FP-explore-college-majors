3925901,1,B002GSXKRE,"Having never read the book, I picked up this movie off a shelf at the public library.  I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie.  I've never seen anything like it.  I thought the acting was terrible.  I thought the constant wind sounds were terrible, and I thought the film making in general was terrible.  Example: You go from a scene which was winter and then to transition to spring all of a sudden you're looking at the moors and there's a lamb standing there.  That disappears and you're back to the story.  All this dysfunctional family does is scream at each other and hate each other.  It seems like everyone is cruel to each other.  The doctor who delivers Frances' baby is heartless.  I was so horrified while watching this, I couldn't NOT watch.  I had to see if it could get any worse.  I don't know - in a strange way, I'm so intrigued by this production, that I might just have to get the book to compare!",1296950400,,943,4.265536723163842
3925902,2,B002GSXKRE,"This was almost unbearable to watch with Ian McShane as Heathcliff, and I did not like it. It's very long, and follows the book closely, but Heathcliff did NOT slit his wrists in the end as this movie portrayed. The earlier one with Olivier and Oberon was shorter, but better, and I liked Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff as well - even Ralph Fiennes was most believable. But, McShane became more like a gorilla than a man toward the end, or would make an excellent Wolfman.",1294963200,,470,4.541176470588235

3925904,4,B002GSXKRE,"Though this was filmed with the usual extremely limited BBC budget
in 1967, it somehow works for this particular epic story.  Director
Peter Sasdy later made a minor name in horror films in the '70's,
so he has a great sense of the Gothic.  The adaptation by award-
winning playwright Hugh Leonard preserves the entirety of Emily
Bronte's story, closer than most versions made before this time.
Ian McShane is, hands down, one of the best Heathcliffs ever.
He really was born to play this role. It's too bad his performance
is somewhat sabotaged by having to play opposite one of the worst
Cathys ever.  Angela Scoular, (a future Bond girl - see 'On Her
Majestys Secret Service') is simply dreadful.  Granted, Cathy
is an extremely difficult role to play. That aside, the fact
this version is broken down into four 45 minute episodes makes
it very easy for the unacquainted (i.e. literature students) to
watch and absorb.",1263513600,3,921,4.810126582278481
3925905,5,B002GSXKRE,"This is an early recording of Wuthering Heights by the BBC and is in black and white. Despite this it seems to have more atmosphere than later productions, acting is good, and seems to be quite an accurate rendition of the book. Very pleased with this but beware - this is a USA zone DVD (if in UK, check playable zones).",1258156800,15,321,4.278688524590164
3925906,5,B002GSXKRE,"I've probably seen every film and TV version of ""Wuthering Heights"" (in addition to having read the book several times). When I ordered this DVD I wondered if it would really add anything to my collection. The answer is yes. The actors manage to pull off the most difficult task for this story: Making the characters sympathetic. Considering that faithful family servant Ellen is the only voice of normalcy and stability in a nest of emotionally driven and self-centered people, most of them obsessed with revenge, self-destruction, and/or death, that's a feat. (The four episodes are titled ""The First Revenge,"" ""The Second Revenge,"" etc.) Angela Scoular as Cathy Earnshaw comes across as wayward but often enchanting--in many films Cathy is just a, ahem, female dog. A young Ian McShane plays Heathcliff. He has the same deep (but somewhat less gravelly) voice as in ""Deadwood,"" the same semi-scarcastic, semi-Shakespearean delivery--and having not yet acquired jowels, he's broodingly handsome. The 1960s black-and-white format seems a bit primitive today, but it some ways it adds power. The climate looks cold and wet, the fields look stony, the scarce trees look blasted. The Wuthering Heights farmhouse looks drafty, dirty, and crudely furnished. Food looks unappetizing; it consists largely of porridge and tea. This cheerless atmosphere is greatly aided by a soundtrack of constantly whistling wind, for both indoor and outdoor scenes. I was literally so cold that I turned the heat up to watch this series.",1256947200,30,1516,5.268595041322314
3925907,2,B002GSXKRE,"First off, I am not rating this film as a romance, nor am I critiquing how well Ian McShane or Angela Scoular can act in misfitting roles. Instead, I am critiquing this adaptation of Wuthering Heights in comparison to Emily Bronte's novel, which I have read numerous times.

Now, let me say that this adaptation of Wuthering Heights, 1967, is NOT worthy of being called a BBC classic, as the cover tries to convince the potential buyer.

Why?

Answer: Because the plot of this production is horribly badly because it alters important dialogue. It is the equivalent of a Hamlet production, by the BBC under the label ""classic,"" where Hamlet says ""Should I kill myself or no?"" instead of ""To be or not to be, that is the question?""

Yet, the plot is not the only problem. Also, Ian McShane is too old to play Heathcliff, at least the teenage scenes (which have been altered into youth adult scenes thanks to horrible script-writing).

Born in 1942, this MAN plays Heathcliff for the whole film, except for the first eight minutes, when some little five year old (or someone who appears five) is brought home by Mr. Earnshaw from Liverpool. Now, I understand the desire for constancy in acting. Four different individuals playing Heathcliff over 30 years might make some viewers disappointed. Yet, in this adaptation, how can anyone feel sorry for Heathcliff when 50 pages of the novel are removed - the most important 50 pages in understand why Heathcliff becomes so bitter and angry. Forgive me, but when 25 year old Ian McShane loses 23 year old Angela Scoular so some other actor playing an equally elderly Edgar Linton, I just do not feel much sympathy for the approximately 16 year old Heathcliff of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, who runs away from Wuthering Heights after Cathy says, ""Marrying Heathcliff would degrade me.""

Now, I understand the 1992 adaptation, the 1998 adaptation, and the 2009 adaptation are also unfaithful portrayals of a wondering work of literature. Yet, this adaptation takes first prize. I simply wonder why the producers just didn't have Ian McShane as the bundle Mr. Earnshaw brings back from Liverpool. I do wonder what the script writer could possibly have been thinking by having other characters call Heathcliff a 'gypsy' at least 20 times. [Certainly, Heathcliff may have been a gypsy, just as he may have been something else. However, in this film, there is great concensus that Heathcliff is a stupid gypsy.]

Continuing with this point, MacShane plays a Heathcliff who reminds one of a highly evolved monkey. He is stupid - not passionate. He is gready for Cathy - not a soulmates with her, who suffered abuse as a teenager. Bronte's Heathcliff needs Cathy and relies upon her - he is the teenager who can accept all the bullies's abuses as long as the girl he loves, loves him back. Such a Heathcliff does not exist in this adaptation.

One Thing I ABSOLUTELY DETESTED about this adaptation:

If you read Emily Bronte's novel, you would learn that Heathcliff is a teenager when Mr. Earnshaw dies - 14 years of age is a good estimate. Now, imagine Hindley (who hates Heathcliff), taking a 14 year old boy, overworking him, repeatedly whipping him very severely, and keeping him from the one thing he loves and depends upon (his soulmate Cathy). All of this is non-existant in this film. Hindley's wife does not ever die until after Heathcliff has left Wuthering Heights. Therefore, all those wonderful scenes where a drunken Hindley takes out his anger on Heathcliff for his wife's death, are non-existent. Heathcliff and Catherine clearly have a childhood together, grow up together, and bond together as teenagers, but you would never know this based upon this sorry excuse for a film.

BOTTON LINE:

Again, if you are into the romance, and care nothing for understanding the motivation of human behavior - why Heathcliff behaves as he does, why does Hindley behaves as he does, well, this film might be right for you.

However, if you expect this film to, in some way, resemble the BBC classic adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" (1983) starring Timothy Dalton or the 1973 BBC ""Jane Eyre"" adaptation starring Michael Jayston, you will be as disappointed as if Bertha Mason's character were completely eliminated from of these two relatively faithful adapations.",1249516800,24,4299,4.898211829436039

3925912,2,B002GSXKRE,"I haven't seen as many versions as others here, but I really didn't care for this one. It was dark and dreary and the sound of the wind, at times, nearly overtook the dialog to the point that I missed some of what was said. I realize they were trying to portray the mood, but watching this was almost uncomfortable. I'll look at some of the other versions available but this DVD will most likely just gather dust on the shelf.",1342310400,,426,4.271604938271605

3925914,5,B002GSXKRE,EXCELLENT DVD AND THE SERIE IS JUST GREAT. IT WAS A GREAT PURCHASE. I RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THIS NOVEL OF EMILY BRONTE.,1326499200,3,136,4.269230769230769
3925915,3,B002GSXKRE,"Emily Bronte is one of my favorite authors.  Bronte displays the human soul as it struggles with many of the terrible experiences of human existence.  In Wuthering Heights, a classic story, several characters develop personality traits through human experiences.  Hindley, the older brother, becomes jealous when it appears that his father favors younger, adopted, brother Heathcliff.  Heathcliff and sister Catherine acquire a love bond Cathy views as ""soul mates.""  Heathcliff develops a growing feeling of hatred of his older brother.  Emily Bronte's novel is a masterful narration of deep human emotions.

In any film of this great novel, I expect to see the story build later motivations.  So, in this case, why is Hindley increasing cruel to Heathcliff?  Why does Heathcliff endure Hindley's abuse instead of leaving Wuthering Heights or fighting back?  What drives Heathcliff's later hate of the Linton family.  In this film I see little attempt to build the psychological elements so marvelously told in Bronte's novel.

I expected to see Heathcliff and Catherine as young teenagers, instead both appear to be older.  I expected scenes depicting a drunken Hindley abusing characters and taking his anger out on his siblings.  This film shows few of the psychologically motivating scenes that are in Bronte's novel.

This BBC movie of Wuthering Heights was produced in 1967, in black and white.  Color was available, but I think the producer opted for black and while to enhance the mood.  During most of the film a strong sound of howling wind underlies the dialogue.  Scenes within the house are mostly shown as poorly lit and dreary.  All this combines to produce a dismal mood, but after awhile the wind became distracting to both me and my wife.

I highly recommend the novel Wuthering Heights.  This particular film rendering of it, however, does little justice to Bronte's work.  I suggest another of the films, either Samuel Goldwyn's production starring Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, and David Niven, or The Paramount production staring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes.",1306713600,,2090,5.231927710843373
3925916,2,B002GSXKRE,"Not a bad rendition of the story on film, but nothing special.  It did tell the entire story from beginning to end and I give it credit for that.  Somehow, the characters were as listless as the black and white DVD.  In my opinion, there are better versions of this story on DVD including the one with Timothy Dalton and Anne Calder-Marshall.  It was disappointing to see Ian McShane in such a lackluster performance as he is a much better actor.",1298678400,,446,4.469135802469136
3925917,5,B002GSXKRE,"I didn't even know this version existed.  It's been a while since I read the book so I can't speak to any liberties taken with Ms. Bronte's source material.  I very much still like the Timothy Dalton version with the lovley Michel Legrand score, but there was much to like in this 60s British TV version.  A nice companion to the also neglected made-for-TV George C. Scott/Susannah York ""Jane Eyre.""  Those Bronte girls could certainly write up a storm!",1297555200,7,453,4.69620253164557

8370007,3,B002GSXKRE,I was hoping to really love it as I'm a fan of Ian McShane but I've found other versions that I like much better.  I guess it was a little too dated for me and lacked emotion/chemistry for my taste.,1504569600,,198,3.95
8370008,2,B002GSXKRE,Bought it for Ian McShane . . . it's a pretty weak version of the story though.,1484179200,,79,3.7058823529411766
8370009,4,B002GSXKRE,"The great virtue of this version of ""Wuthering Heights"" is that it isn't afraid to take about 3 hours and thereby do justice to both generations of the story.  Almost inevitably, it straightens out the book's amazing ""boxes-within-boxes"" narrative structure [in which two peripheral characters, Nelly and Lockwood, and some of the main characters (Heathcliff, the older Cathy, and Isabella)] divide up the narration, and one effect of that is that the book's first scenes are among the movie's last.  Still, that's a price I'm willing to pay for a fuller story, even if the book's order of events sets up an atmosphere and expectations that just can't come across here.  (Just by the way, Emily Bronte's control of her complicated narrative is a thing to wonder at in a young, first-time novelist.).  And I have to say that I think that the director here is taking for granted SOME awareness of the novel on his viewers' parts -- there are chronological jumps that are just unapologetically taken, and I wondered if I might not have been taken aback had I not read the novel (many times!).

One of the most striking things in this version is Angela Scoular's performance as the older Cathy -- she plays the younger Cathy too, but that's an easier task.  There's no other way to put it -- the older Cathy is a monster, almost totally out of her father's, then her husband's, control, given to screaming fits and extreme behaviour.  She's like a child in a woman's body, and I can't help but think (and this seems to me in line with the novel) that she and Heathcliff are and remain essentially children, with children's insistent demands and unreasonableness, always looking back as adults at their childhoods as the ideal phase of their relationship,  As adults, they are children with adult abilities and powers, and that's a very scary prospect.  Heathcliff's revenge on the Lintons and the other Earnshaws is just childish extremity applied to its targets with the single-mindedness and persistence that adulthood and status can bring.  Be all that as it may, Scoular's older Cathy is almost totally unsympathetic here, and Scoular doesn't shy away from vividly portraying her emotional rapacity.  As the younger Cathy, she's a well-meaning, willful pretty girl, capable of passion but also capable of empathy, which neither her mother (the older Cathy) nor Heathcliff are capable of.

Ian McShane's Heathcliff is very good -- implacable, focused only on Cathy, and, after her marriage, only on revenge.  My only minor complaint about him is that even as the older Heathcliff, scruffed up and desperate, he still looks a bit young.  But he brings an energy and passionate sense of movement to the role that is totally convincing.  We see him go from gypsy to sullen boy, to man-of-the-world (with improved accent), then fall back into an older, almost feral state.  The conception of the character has a clear arc, and McShane traces it very well.  The other actors -- none well-known to me -- are all fine.  The opening makes clearer than the book the sense in which the whole tragedy is set in motion by an act of kindness (old Mr. Earnshaw's taking-in of Heathcliff), and as the story goes on we see that kindness isn't always returned with kindness.  If I had to single out one other especially strong performance here, it would be that of William Marlowe as Hindley, the older Cathy's older brother and father of Hareton.  He's like a Heathcliff without the final cruelty, and he too suffers a loss, but it's turned more to self-destruction in his case.  To Marlowe'scredit, he's a character we come to feel for; cruel and rash though he is, he's lost.

The movie is filmed in black-and white.  The sound effects are of wind and weather.  I don't remember hearing music on the soundtrack -- good choice.  In other movies, Timothy Dalton, Laurence Olivier, and Ralph Fiennes have their moments -- but the fuller narrative here gives Ian McShane more to engage us with.  Strongly recommended.",1481673600,,3998,4.851251840942562

8370011,5,B002GSXKRE,"This was fantastic! Being filmed in black and white and with the howling wind, used as one of the characters. it was so creepy.
  This was the closest to the actual book I've ever seen. Ian McShane was superb!
  Yes the wigs were bad and you could see the spirit glue a couple of times on his mutton chops...but I didn't care, because I was pulled into the show by the acting.
  The camera angles and sound affects were excellent.  Sometimes, the cast can deliver, but if badly directed and filmed, the movie is ruined.  I think the crew deserveS a lot of credit.  Even though it is 1960s TV, they did the best they could and their best was good enough.  Making the constantly howling wind on the moors almost another cast member was the perfect touch.  No silly sound track, just the wind and rushing water for the opening and the wind for the closing credits.  Well, done BBC!
  Whether you like Gothic Romance or just a good scare (I needed to watch an episode of Taxi to calm my nerves), this movie delivers.
  It is too bad that you actually have to type in Ian McShane to bring this version up.",1437436800,3,1100,4.318627450980392

8370013,2,B002GSXKRE,"Ian McShane as Heathcliff?!! Handsome, wild, and brooding, McShane is more than suitable for the dark, romantic lead in ""Wuthering Heights"". On the flip side is Angela Scoular who rightly portrays Cathy as a flighty creature. Unfortunately, this Cathy is so overbaked that she frequently comes across as batty and irritating. What's more, the casting director has Scoular playing Cathy's equally insufferable daughter, Catherine. Overall, the acting is slightly glitchy. Do not expect a glorious production, as might be judged from the dvd cover. This four part mini-series is in black and white and sometimes has the semblance of a stage play. It takes a chronological approach rather than beginning with the lodger who stumbles upon Thrushcross Grange (as written in the novel). While it aims to be seriously dramatic, I couldn't help but laugh at the abundance of bad hair. If you make it to the end of this seemingly interminable version, you'll see the liberties that the make-up artist took with Heathcliff's appearance. And so, silently, you mumble to yourself, ""Where the feck did this werewolf come from?!!""",1427587200,,1116,5.205555555555556
