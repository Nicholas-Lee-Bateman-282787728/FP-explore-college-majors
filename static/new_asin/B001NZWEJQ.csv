8328557,5,B001NZWEJQ,No other movies in the west or east has come close the the drama in this thriller. It is a haunting story and the music is as much a part of the movie as the action. Madhubala is beautiful and was a mere teenager when she made this movie. Each time I watch it I see something else new and exciting to enjoy.,1394841600,,307,3.888888888888889
8328558,4,B001NZWEJQ,"MAHAL is a ghost story and the first ever HORROR film (and quite possibly the best) from India. It is a suspenseful ride filled with NIGHTMARISH elements. Mahal follows a man named Shankar as he moves into a mansion
HAUNTED by the woman the former mansion owner was having a affair with.
The more Shankar obsesses over her spirit the less control he has over his mind. A must own for HORROR fanatics of all decades and themes.",1302048000,,426,4.4743589743589745
8328559,4,B001NZWEJQ,"Music India released this disc in July 2008 and this is the best print of this film I've seen and the most complete.  It runs rings around the Eros International DVD (although the Eros disc has superior subtitling).  The subtitles are timed more accurately on this disc than on the Bollywood Films DVD that came out some time ago.

For now I give this DVD four stars.  If Music India or any other company ever restores this film, gives it the Criterion treatment, so that the print is as close to pristine as possible, and provides a scholarly commentary, I'll give it five stars.  I know that's asking a lot.  But this film deserves to be restored.  There may already be such a project in the works.  I hope someone is taking on this challenge.",1242259200,,745,4.466666666666667
