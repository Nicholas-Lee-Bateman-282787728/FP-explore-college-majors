8680231,5,B00937VF6Y,"Heard about this movie 2 years ago. It was entered into competition at Cannes 2011, never shown in the US. It is about a village in Morroco where the women withhold sex from the men in the village, in order to make them dig a well in town. They ask for 1 thing and the men feel they are not entitled to this one luxury, after all making the 1 hour trip up the hill, and 1 hour trip down the hill with buckets of water would make the women lazy. It has to be circulated and talked about, a real lovely film. It shows that you don't have to spend millions to make a beautiful film.",1356998400,2,579,3.9572649572649574
