8554082,3,B00AMQGJ02,"UPDATE - It seems that there is now a DVD-R disclaimer on this product description in multiple places, that I swear was not there when I bought this item back in August.  Thank you Amazon for updating the product description to include the dvd-r information.

I bought this dvd and did not realize these movies were recorded on a dvd-r disc.  I have an older DVD player that does not play dvd-r discs, so I am forced to watch this on my laptop.  I bought this disc specifically for Oleanna, one of my favorite movies.  David Mamet is one of my favorite writers and directors, and Oleanna is an interesting story with witty dialogue.",1438560000,,632,4.508771929824562
