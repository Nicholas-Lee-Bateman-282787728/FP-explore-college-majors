And the songs that they put into the program are so cute. My favorite has to be ""C DRIVES ME CRAZY"".  If you were around in the 80's you will get a kick out of this song.  Just a very cute program that should be part of every kids collection for Sesame Street. I wish they did more with Cookie Monster.  I think he can handle a starring role in another program.",1098144000,3,537,4.144230769230769
682333,4,6303541631,"Above is a quote from my two-year-old about his favorite Monster.  Unfortunately, he doesn't understand the concept of the public library.  However, even though we rented it over two months ago, he still asks for it whenever cookies come up in conversation.
This is a terrific video for little kids and grown-up kids alike.  Unlike many Sesame Street videos, the introductory footage is better than many of the clips - the idea being that Cookie Monster has been turned loose in an empty bakery.  He has to overcome a lot of obstacles in order to get to his ultimate goal - EATING THE COOKIES!!!  I love the bit with the cookbook; it's a terrific performance by Frank Oz in what I think is his best - or at least MY favorite - muppet role.
I enjoy the clips as well - ""C is for Cookie"" (if that needs an explanation, you need more PBS in your home) ""C drives me Crazy"" (my son's favorite - a performance by the ""Fine Young Camels"" - hysterical!) ""If Moon Were Cookie"" (sort of a lukewarm Cookie version of ""I Don't Want To Live On The Moon"") ""What Is Friend"" (not very good rapport between the two monsters - I like the live-people version better), ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" (Cookie and Guy Smiley explain subtraction and the number zero) and, my favorite ""Goodbye Little Cookie"" which has no educational value at all, but Garrison Keillor should feature it on his show the next time he does Cowboy Poetry, it's that good.
This one's a keeper.  Now I just need to buy a copy!!",1038614400,20,1486,4.444852941176471
682334,5,6303541631,"Parents,
Hello. This is a great video tape for Cookie Monster fans.
My 8 year old boy loves Cookie Monster. This a great tape. The songs in this tape are C is For Cookie, C Drives Me Crazy, If Moon Were Cookie, What Is Friend, They Can't Take That Away From Me, and Goodbye Little Cookie. So get a little Cookie Monster In You.",1018742400,,327,4.125
682335,4,6303541631,"While this pales in comparison to ""Big Bird Sings"", there are some classics found here. Of course, ""C Is for Cookie"" is here, but that's on a lot of other SS videos as well. This is basically for the die-hard SS fan, or for those who just love the Cookie Monster.  END",894844800,5,268,4.153846153846154

Still, the video content is fantastic and entertaining.",1400457600,,334,4.491803278688525

682412,4,6303541631,"If you have little ones at home that love Sesame Street, this Cookie Monster dvd is perfect for them and also is entertaining enough to keep the adults engaged.  The best segment is a music video set to the tune of the Fine Young Cannibals' ""She Drives Me Crazy"" called ""C Drives Me Crazy"" in which a camel in the desert extoles his love for the third letter of the alphabet.  Of course Cookie Monster doesn't fail to entertain and educate when the main plot of the video finds him trying show self control from gobbling up a plate of cookies he just baked.",1361923200,,557,4.346153846153846
682413,5,6303541631,"I received this DVD for my toddler son. He loves it. It contains several classic Cookie Monster clips (e.g., C is for Cookie, If moon was cookie) all strung together with a story line of Cookie Monster starting a business as a baker. This is about a 30 minute DVD. I love that it has other Sesame Street characters (thankfully, not Elmo!) but they only do cameos. The big focus is on Cookie Monster and he has a great sense of humor. I especially loved the sigh of frustration Cookie Monster makes when Annette Benning asks him questions about 'here' and 'there.' Great introduction to a classic Sesame Street character!",1361750400,,620,4.6454545454545455

Naturally, when we saw Cookie Monster's Best Bites, we thought it would be a perfect DVD for her. Not so much. These are all older Cookie Monster scenes and none of the segments are interesting enough to keep her attention. The old Cookie isn't very witty or funny. The new Cookie has more of an attitude, which our baby finds hilarious. This DVD will be collecting dust for now. We've learned from this that we have to pay attention to the publication dates.",1354320000,,594,4.3125

Both he and his 19 month old brother love this one. It has a nice balance of song and talking. My kids sing along with the songs, and laugh out loud at Cookie Monster's impatience to get those cookies.  Sure, the character's got a problem with subject pronouns, but his vocabulary is otherwise great, and he's so pure in his commitment to cookies. I wish I could find another video this good.

If this is the case with your child, don't waste money on all the DVDs trying to get Cookie Monster glimpses... This one will be a success! :-)  It teaches ""Here and There"" and ""Fast and Slow"", letter recognition, words that start with ""C"" and even sings a bedtime song and country ""twang"" at the end.  My 16 month son will actually SIT and watch this video!  It's really fun for us as parents too, because all muppet films have some ""advanced"" humor (i.e. ""Medieval Cookie Torture) :-)  I'd give it MORE stars if I could!",1164499200,2,597,4.431192660550459

682532,4,6303541631,"I find this DVD rather mediocre, too brief and even a little annoying. Cookie Monster has had better appearances, the DVD runs a scant thirty minutes and there is a video for one song in which Cookie Monster does not even appear. My two-year old son, however, loves it and watches it repeatedly. Since he is the intended audience, I give it four stars. He doesn't scrutinize the quality of the skits the way I do and anything more than thirty minutes would challenge his attention span. In addition to the obvious inclusion of ""C is For Cookie,"" the DVD also includes a fantasy about the moon being a giant cookie, sharing cookies with friends, bidding adieu to a beloved cookie and a skit with Annette Bening. As one would expect with content from Sesame Street, the material is educational and teaches acceptance and social skills. It is brought together by a running skit, specifically created for this video, featuring Cookie Monster as a newly employed baker... with expected results. Caution should be exercised because anyone familiar with Cookie Monster already knows that your toddler will pick up poor eating habits, meaning stuffing cookies into their mouths and leaving crumbs all over. If you can live with that, this is worry-free entertainment and a good recommendation.",1154995200,10,1285,4.953703703703703

She calls Cookie Monster ""Cook-Cook"" and previously only knew him through a few bath toys, books, stuffed animals, and the Sesame Street games on their website. Now, she dances, sings, and laughs along with him.",1154908800,3,378,4.742424242424242
682574,2,6303541631,"I Absolutely agree with Joe Sixpack who wrote in and rightfully pointed out that Sesame Street, which began in '69 (Along with Mr. Rogers Neighborhood which started a little earlier) should be released chronologically just like every other TV sitcom/series that is being issued out there today; it just makes more sense and is easier to follow. Joe is right on the mark, too, mentioning that the older Sesame shows are superior efforts overall to the modern ones (80's and newer) with no didsy Elmo. A good portion of the buying public, especially for these older shows, are purists - CTV, are you listening????",1143936000,8,611,4.884615384615385
682575,2,6303541631,This disc is FAR from having Cookie's best bites!  The skit w/Anette Benning is just barely tolerable.  Not at all what it advertises. Too bad.,1143590400,4,143,4.68
682576,5,6303541631,"I purchased this dvd for my three kids.  What I didn't realize is how much I would enjoy it.  This is classic Cookie at his best.  One of my sons is enamored with anything Cookie and is glued to the television when I play the dvd for him.  Unfortunately on the TV show, Cookie isn't on but a few minutes a day so my children prefer the dvds over the show.  The songs on the video are the ones that originally aired in the 70's and 80's and aren't dated at all.  In between the clips is Cookie baking cookies--this segment flows well between the songs.  All in all you can't miss with this one.  This dvd, along with a Cookie Monster from Build-a-bear is a great gift idea!",1140739200,3,672,4.155038759689923

Some of the good ones include ""C is for Cookie"", ""C Drives Me Crazy"" by the Fine Young CAMELS, ""Here and There"" with Annette Bening, and ""Fast and Slow"" a very funny skit with Telly.

Oh, and you gotta bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies before watching... then everyone will enjoy it.

One thing though: Don't buy this if you don't want to go around singing ""C is for Cookie..."" all day.  I just can't get that song out of my head!!!!!",1137974400,2,550,4.281553398058253

The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!  Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own...
