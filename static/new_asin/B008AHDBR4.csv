8526495,5,B008AHDBR4,"I don't normally write reviews, but in this case I felt I had to, because I love this DVD set.

I have been a Laurel and Hardy fan since I was young.  But they haven't been on TV in America since the 1980s.  I stumbled on the absolutely fantastic restored re-release of their Hal Roach talkies ""Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection"" (available on Amazon), and it got me wondering about their lives, and in particular why they left Hal Roach to make mediocre movies for Fox/MGM.

This documentary answered that question when I was unable to find the answer on the Internet.  I haven't read any biographies in book form of these men whose films have given me so much joy throughout my life, but this documentary made me feel that I don't need to.  It's an affectionate biography, but it does show the ""warts"" in a way that humanizes these comic geniuses.

There is a lot of rare footage, and footage (such as color footage of their European music hall tours) that I've never seen anywhere else.  The ""postcards"" are thick sturdy cardboard, one of which I'm thinking of having framed (the reproduction of a sepia tone photo with autographs).

If you're a fan of Laurel and Hardy, I can't imagine that you won't absolutely love this.  The music on the menu of the bonus DVD (lasting about a minute) haunts me.  It seems both regal and somewhat jovial, suitable for court jesters to a King (and Laurel and Hardy did have a command performance).  I wish I knew where that music came from.

I got my copy about a week before the earliest estimated arrival date, so buy without fear.

Also, it's about 90% in English, with the rest (German, French) having subtitles.

I guess the last thing I'll say about this set is that I know I'll watch it more than once.  It's that well done.",1436400000,,1777,4.50625
8526496,5,B008AHDBR4,Nicely written and edited. Bonus material good too. Great for any L&H fan's collection. You won't regret purchasing! :) :),1375660800,3,122,5.15
8526497,5,B008AHDBR4,"A 2-disc documentary DVD In English, French, and German, this is truly a collector's DVD because it provides an interesting history of their personal and professional lives.  Sons of the Desert will knowingly appreciate many hilarious clips from their shorts and feature movies,  plus color interviews of them.  Most interesting are interviews with Laurel and Hardy experts Hal Roach, Lucille Hardy-Price, Richard W. Bann, Tyler St. Mark, Bart Williams, Chuck McCann and Jim MacGeorge, Phillis Coates, Jean Darling -- and Stan & Ollie's friends Booth Colman, Jerry Lewis, and Marcel Marceau. See also the precious, exclusive interview Stan Laurel's daughter Lois gave. Therefore this documentary is is an emotional story of the world's most beloved comedy team.  One DVD is 105 minutes; the other is 70 minutes of ""bonus material.""  Most interesting to me is the footage of Stan's quite luxiurious yacht.",1365724800,4,904,5.338028169014085
