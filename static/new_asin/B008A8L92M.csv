Lois is the best teacher and you will be amazed at what your intuition will tell you or has been telling all of your life.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are even remotely interested in learning more about intuition and developing it for yourself.  Using the insight and exercises that Lois provides, your life will never be the same again.  My life has changed for the better and I have been able to help so many of my friends and family.  Lois G is the real deal and an outstanding teacher.  You will be blown away.",1340064000,,654,4.260162601626016

Lois helped me to recognize those moments for what they truly are....INTUITION! But that is just a small part of what she teaches.

She is a fantastic instructor and knows how to make it easy. I would highly recommend this to anyone. You will be pleasantly surprised at just how intuitive you really are!",1339977600,,464,4.333333333333333
