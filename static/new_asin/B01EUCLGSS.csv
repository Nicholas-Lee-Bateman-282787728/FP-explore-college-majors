7740814,5,B01EUCLGSS,"My toddler loves this DVD and all the songs on it. We watch or listen to it almost daily.
The Wiggles take on several musical genres with hits like 1960's pop sounding ""The Wonder of Wiggle Town,"" Classic Country styled ""Gymkana Yodel,"" Discoesque ""Do The Pretzel,"" and the early 20th Century hit ""On the Sidewalks of New York."" Every song is upbeat and catchy enough for all family members to sing along.
This is sure to become an instant hit with your family!",1474502400,,461,4.566265060240964
