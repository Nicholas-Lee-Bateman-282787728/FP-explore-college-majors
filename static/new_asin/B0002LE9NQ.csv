8028817,5,B0002LE9NQ,"I have been a fan of director Takashi Miike for a long time, although I confess I didn't realize how diverse his films were until just a few years ago.  And when I say diverse, Im not kidding; Miike has made movies that range from family-friendly to just downright wrong.  This is definitely a good thing, as it does not confine him to a certain stereotype, but the Black Society Trilogy are the three films that helped define him for a generation of film buffs.

THE BLACK SOCIETY TRILOGY is comprised of three different movies that really have nothing to do with each other.  They were shot within a four-year span, although Miike did several other titles during this period as well.  These three stand out as some of the best examples of his distinct style.  And as a result, they are a trio of absolute classics.

Miike has 100 directing credits in his filmography, and Im chagrinned to admit Ive only seen about 15 of his films.  But every one Ive seen has been fantastic, regardless of the genre.  I am consistently impressed with the wide skillset Miike presents with his filmmaking.

Each film in THE BLACK SOCIETY TRILOGY is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  The HD transfer looks nice, offering crisp imagery and impeccable sound.  I saw RAINY DOG years ago on DVD, and the picture quality was terrible.  Im glad to see the Blu-ray version is much, much improved.

The acting in each film is great, although I admit Im only vaguely familiar with a few of the names.  The actor that stood out the most is one I recognized from a previous film:  Kazuki Kitamura, who portrays Ryuichi in LEY LINES, was also Boss Koji from the Crazy 88 in KILL BILL: VOLUME 2.  This lack of recognizable actors does nothing to detract from the films, however.

The stories in each film of THE BLACK SOCIETY TRILOGY are complex and well-developed.  SHINJUKU TRIAD SOCIETY is a riveting crime-thriller with top-notch pacing and an intriguing concept.  Likewise, RAINY DOG is a darkly humorous thriller that captivates, thanks to the drama between the yakuza and his unwanted son.  And finally, LEY LINES is a dark, atmospheric movie that deals with detachment and alienation.  The stark difference in each film is a testament to the diverse talents of their accomplished director.

If I were forced to pick a favorite film out of this group, Id probably go with RAINY DOG.  As I mentioned, I had seen it before, therefore I knew what to expect.  When compared to the other two films, its a bit more light-hearted and therefore not as tense.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I loved LEY LINES and SHINJUKU TRIAD SOCIETY as well.  But RAINY DOG struck a chord with me, and it is therefore the one that stands out most in my mind.

THE BLACK SOCIETY TRILOGY is a major win for me, and I highly recommend adding it to your movie library.  These are quintessential Miike films, so if you're a fan of his style or even just Japanese crime-thrillers in general, these three films are must-haves.",1485734400,4,2977,4.625954198473282
8028818,4,B0002LE9NQ,"Like most foreign film industries, Japan has struggled to find its place in the world against the Hollywood juggernaut.  But inevitably, independent filmmakers fill the nooks and crannies bigger studios leave behind.  Instead of competing against Hollywood head-to-head, they embrace what makes their culture unique.  And, in director Takashi Miike's case, throwing in some shock appeal only adds to the international attention.

Kicking off his career in the seedy, over-the-top ""V-Cinema"" arena (direct-to-video features that peaked in Japan in the mid-80s), Miike's work took a big leap forward with what's come to be known as The Black Society Trilogy.  Set amongst the grim, gritty but sometimes-ridiculous world of the yakuza (Japanese gangsters), the three films balance intense moments of sex and violence with introspective lead characters and social-political commentary.  That might sound like a typical indie cinema roadmap, but Miike, who's garnered just as much outrage as acclaim, is the sort of director you just can't predict once he gets behind the wheel.

Shinjuku Triad Society (1995) follows an equally unpredictable cop on the trail of a criminal trafficking in human organs.  Rainy Dog (1997) is the sad profile of a yakuza hitman who's saddled with a son he didn't know he had.  And, finally, Ley Lines (1999) circles around a quartet of criminal misfits trying to make a new start.  That theme of escape and fragile emotional connections runs through each film, centered on a Chinese immigrant experience that doesn't paint a pretty picture.  Miike's characters grab pleasure when they can; because life isn't just cheap...it's unpredictably short.

Bouncing between Scorsese-style gang warfare with a distinctly Japanese bent, Shinjuku Triad Society is the most schizophrenic of the trilogy.  The script follows an ostensibly standard cop formula, but interrupts the investigation with in-your-face perversions (anal sex is used an interrogation device not once but twice) and a virulent strain of black humor.  Rainy Dog is the most ""American"" of the bunch, often feeling like a macho take on the work of Walter Hill (The Warriors) complete with Ry Cooder sound-alike score.  But it's also the most visually polished, with quick, dirty and effective action scenes that match anything in Hill's oeuvre.  Ley Lines seems inspired by the freedom of the French New Wave, finding a genuine innocence amongst its desperately naive cast of characters.

Miike's skill as a director lies in his adaptability.  Cranking out a minimum of three films a year, his career mirrors that of an old Hollywood craftsmen working in the studio system.  While not always responsible for the films' content, he almost inevitably makes them better, working in the sort of genres that get little to no respect.  The Black Society Trilogy is still unique in the way it drills down into the hearts and souls of characters who many would suspect didn't have either to begin with.

Arrow Video USA's set contains HD transfers of all three films along with audio commentaries for each by Miike biographer Tom Mes.  Those tracks probably provide the most scene specific info, but Miike himself chimes in with a 45-minute interview discussing the start of his career and the Trilogy specifically (the director is humble, self-effacing and happy to give credit where it's due).  Star Show Aikawa pops up for a new interview as well along with trailers and an illustrated collector's booklet.",1485561600,7,3485,5.250902527075812
8028819,3,B0002LE9NQ,"the movies are ok. i'm a big Takashi Miike fan. I love most of his movies....But here, i think the man was on a bad acid trip or something. F@##$%* beyond weird. First you got Homesexuality...I'm not gay so i don't care for it in the movies i purchase. Simply put, i can do without. Then the weird editing and plot holes. Now don't get me wrong, trademark Takashi Miike touches are there. Since this series is one of his early works then i will give him a pass as this being a experimental over the top { how far can i go in filming with out it being banned } phase.  I suggest stick with his later work where he really shines like Audition, Gozu, Ichi the Killer, Agitator and i think his best work being "" Deadly Outlaw: Rekka"", 'Yakuza Demon'  and  "" Graveyard of Honor "". If your looking for that here, well you may be dissapointed.  Still its a mind F@##$%* of an experiance. For 1 viewing its ok...but as a keeper in your library i think not.  The prints of the films are crisp and clean though. Arrow does it again.",1485475200,5,1022,4.1938775510204085
8028820,3,B0002LE9NQ,"Black Society Trilogy is a collection of three thematically connected, character-driven films by Japanese director Takashi Miike. These are crime stories about violence, the underworld of Japanese society, real and surrogate families, and the difficult task of finding ones place in the world.

Set in the bustling Kabuki-cho nightlife neighborhood of Tokyo, Shinjuku Triad Society (1995) is a very violent film about gang culture that follows a family feud separating two brothers, both of whom are Chinese/Japanese. Elder brother Tatsuhito Kiriya is a cop desperate to take down Wang, the leader of a homosexual gang, and will do anything to get his man. But younger brother Yoshiko has recently graduated from law school and has taken the job of representing the cruel crime boss.

Rainy Dog (1997), shot entirely in Taiwan, is about exiled yakuza Yuuji who begins working for a local crime boss, taking jobs wiping out rival gang members. One day, a former lover appears with a young mute boy she claims is his son and leaves him there for Yuuji to raise.

Ley Lines (1999) moves from the countryside to the city and back, as three Japanese youths of Chinese descent seek their fortune in Tokyo only to run afoul of a violent gang boss. Director Miike combines crime-related action, grim sex, and reprehensible characters.

All three films have a gritty look. Their themes relate to one another and reinforce Miikes point of view. He tackles compelling ideas about family relationships, racial pride, and the isolation and alienation of modern society. Made on modest budgets with plenty of action, the Trilogy films offer an alternative to the Hollywood action picture.

Bonus extras on the unrated widescreen 2-disc Blu-ray release include new interviews with director Takashi Miike and actor Show Aikawa; new audio commentaries for all three films by a Miike biographer; original theatrical trailers; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork. The films are in Japanese, with optional English subtitles.",1485216000,3,2040,5.264615384615385
8028821,4,B0002LE9NQ,"To be brief,if you find yourself in need to fill a craving for raw and grit,you can either watch this series or have your backside wire brushed. There is nothing warm and fuzzy in any of these stories,none of them being related to each other except each having,in part,the theme of ""half-breed"", Taiwanese/Japanese kids and adults trying to survive in brutal societies,both in Taiwan and Japan. Murder,rape,homsexuality, gangs, treachery,drugs,poverty,more muder,etc. All the ""good"" stuff. Worth a least one viewing but I may opt for the wire brushing before I do it twice. These are brutal.",1301875200,14,591,5.231578947368421
8028822,5,B0002LE9NQ,"The first film in this collection does follow in the vein of dead or alive and ichi the killer in its subversive, twisting craziness.  However, rainy dog, is much more conventional character study, and far less extreme than the majority of Miike's work.  This film is beautiful and leisurely paced, using the literary device of pathetic falicy, where the external rain of the environment parallels the emotional states of its central characters.  Ley lines is harder hitting with its look at racial bigotry, through its use of sex and violence.  All three films are of his best caliber work and solidify the character's feelings of alienation by their own systems (governmental,yakuza/organized crime,family,racial circles).",1106870400,11,724,5.380530973451328
