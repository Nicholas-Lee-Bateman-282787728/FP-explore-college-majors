2323091,1,B0009UVCLC,"If you enjoy the American Pie series, definitely skip this. It isn't very funny or very sexy.  They had many chances for good jokes, but missed all of them.  The only reason it is rated R is for language and sex talk. The movie should be PG-13 based on the visual content.  Even the cute girls don't get a chance to add much to the movie, not even eye candy.",1424822400,,358,4.085714285714285
2323092,1,B0009UVCLC,"this movie is just bad, bad, bad.  I am pretty certain I did not laugh even once, except maybe at the end because I was laughing at myself for being a fool and watching this flop.  People save 90 minutes of your life and skip this film.",1423353600,3,236,4.0
2323093,5,B0009UVCLC,"This is just a great fun movie! Better than most of the American Pie Movies. Kick back, have a beer and laugh out loud to this flick.",1361232000,,133,3.962962962962963
2323094,1,B0009UVCLC,"The best thing about this movie is that it is a comparatively short movie.  Maybe I am a bit sullen about it because when I was in high school a boy I knew had a party at his house when his parents were away on vacation, and the kids did so much damage that it made both the national news and the Reader's Digest.  Jack, in this movie, was lucky that didn't happen to his house.  The only good I can say about this movie is that it could serve as some half-baked warning to teens to not host parties when their parents are away.  Beyond that, it uses about every trick in the book to break traditional values of honesty, sexuality, etc.",1174521600,3,636,4.146341463414634
2323095,5,B0009UVCLC,"This is an unusual party movie in that it takes place after the party is over with.  What happens when you're a high school kid who has a very messy house, a dead body and a very hung-over girl hanging around? On top of that, a couple hot babes stop over to say hi. Oh, and by the way, your parents are due home in a few hours!  Ack!!

That is the frame around which a series of mid-adventures come to pass.  Our poor lad is trying to set the entire universe aright and the clock is ticking.  And, to top it off, his worthless best friend may as well believe that the party is still going on.

While the DVD is Unrated, I saw nothing in it to warrant it.  Unfortunately, there isn't any nudity, although the movie DID have its opportunities for some.  (Shucks!)  If you're wondering, yes, the title of the movie DOES refer to what you think.

If you like party movies, here is one to add to your collection.  While it lacks some party movie ingredients, it is a very funny film.  Can't ask for anything more than that!",1148169600,2,1018,4.190721649484536
2323096,1,B0009UVCLC,"This falls into the 3% of movies that I've rented expecting to at least somewhat enjoy that ended up being too boring to endure. The script has an amateurish d.i.y. vibe, but not in a unique-comedic-voice-that-actually-has-something-to-say way, in a failed-attempt-at-conventional-edgy-comedy-way. The writer has no ability to create likeable characters, pace a plot, set up a comedic situation, or write dialogue. He wanted so bad to be clever and quirky but every situation or character he introduced to that end just fell flat on it's face. Surely there are plenty of decent writers out there struggling to get their work looked at. How a script so bad actually got financing is beyond me. Maybe the writer has a producer for a dad or something? Obviously some people liked this movie, so you probably shouldn't take my word for it that you won't like it, but I really can't fathom what it would take to enjoy it. Maybe you just have to be someone who thinks any allusion to sex, drugs, and partying automatically equals funny? If you're a Family Guy fan you'd probably like it.",1132963200,10,1081,4.880434782608695
2323097,5,B0009UVCLC,I saw this at a film festival somewhere and found it to be really funny.  A fresh break from typical studio type teen comedies.  this one is well acted and has a good soundtrack and solid laughs.  I won't be surprised if the stars of this movie become BIG stars some day.  This has the makings of a cult classic.  I had a great time watching it and the audience at the theater were in agreement with me.  Enjoy it.,1122249600,3,414,4.1125
2323098,4,B0009UVCLC,"I thought this movie was very funny, but more important was its cult capability.  There are many nuances in the movie that people will enjoy.  For example the dark humor of alledged dead bodies and the prostitute's first time ever inability to service one of them.  This is a typical out-of-control party that occurs thousands of times across the country.  The panic a teenager experiences when trying to cover up such a bash is classic.",1121904000,2,437,4.786666666666667
