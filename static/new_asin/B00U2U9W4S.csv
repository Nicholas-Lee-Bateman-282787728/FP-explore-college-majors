8704067,5,B00U2U9W4S,"Bach keyboard concertos of the highest audio and visual quality.  One thing that I didn't like was the 2 performances of the 4-keyboard concerto, albeit with different pianists; I'd have preferred to have another concerto included.  The improvisations by Gabriela Montero are a nice addition to the collection.  177 minutes of magnificent performances!",1483228800,,352,5.60377358490566
