895312,3,6304513216,"""Turning"" is a movie that touches both your heart and soul. It concerns the problems of a angry young man who returns home to his drunken mother and broken family, trying to mend the wrongs that have occured while  he was gone. Violence explodes when his father's current girlfriend refuses  to leave him. Die-hard X-File fans will be stunned at Gillian Anderson's  preformance, who acts as un-Scully like imaginable, and who also has a  notorious topless (and braless) scene. The actors are exellent, but the  story lacks a good plotline. Good only for casual watching. Explicit  language.",923097600,15,590,5.030927835051546

[originally posted 6Nov2000]

If you've actually made the effort to seek out this film, you did so for one reason and one reason only. And nothing I can say will sway you from renting it. But I'll try anyway.

This film, the acting debut of Gillian Anderson, is well-known among connoisseurs as containing Ms. Anderson's only semi-nude scene. Hate to spoil your fun, but the stills you've seen online are digitally-enhanced.

And everything you've heard about how awful the movie is, aside from the thirty seconds or so in question, is completely true. Clifford Harnish, a white separatist Marine (Michael Dolan, a character actor who often plays military types, most recently in TNT's original film The Hunley), comes home after spending four years away. His girlfriend (Anderson) is working as a waitress for her father (who never liked Clifford in the first place, and likes him less so now), his parents (Raymond Barry, who plays Senator Matheson in The X-Files, and Tess Harper, who has a penchant for playing ""leading man's wife"" in various films) have broken up, and dad is dating the local chanteuse, Glory Lawson (Karen Allen). Everything is predictable; everything is glacial; everyone manages to turn in the worst roles of their careers (and everyone except Anderson had already turned in pretty long careers by this time). Please, for god's sake, avoid this film like the plague. By far the worst thing I've seen this year. (zero stars, of course)",1384041600,,1493,4.9879518072289155

film. On that she was good.",1167868800,2,104,4.473684210526316
7873586,1,6304513216,"Before Gillian Anderson became mega-hit FBI Agent Dana Sully in the phenomenally successful TV series 'The X-Files', her first movie role was in 'The Turning'. With a maximum of two scenes in this film, I found the love scene quite good. All I ever hear about 'The Turning' is the love scene. However if you can live without seeing it, that's fine by me too. You'd be doing yourself a favour if you didn't see it. Other then that I wouldn't waste my time with this film. It took me forever and a day to watch this from start to finish. It moves quite slow and doesn't really have much to say and is quite boring. A son revisits his parents going though a divorce and he tries to stop it from happening getting violent along the way. No one dies and the film just ends. In the 88 minute duration, I was waiting for it to get better and it never happened. Please turn your attention to another DVD. If you want other films with Gillian Anderson in them, check out 'The X-Files Movie', 'Playing It By Heart' and 'The House of Mirth' both three films are of a much better quality and standard to this monstrosity. One bad turn doesn't deserve another.",1141084800,6,1147,4.364485981308412
7873587,1,6304513216,i was utterly repulsed the way people from my state are portrayed in this movie. yes there are people like that in this sate but they have all moved here in the last 15 years. if it weren't for a very brief alomst topless view of gillian anderson this movie would be worthless......sam felts,1047686400,6,291,4.407407407407407
7873588,3,6304513216,"The edition I received did not show a frontal view of Gillian Anderson topless.  The movie showed very little of G Anderson.  The movie was a sermon against and a slap against rural Southerners.  The acting was good but the plot was sick.  The movie portrayed rural North Carolina people as ignorant and unsophisticated.  It was typical Hollywood subliminal, left-wing, liberal propaganda as spouted by CBS, ABC, NBC, Ted Kennedy, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson.  Don't waste your money.  You won't see what you've heard of Gillian Anderson.",1015891200,14,541,5.079545454545454
7873589,5,6304513216,"The Turning had a very good plot about a young man who lived in a small town.  He evidently left town for a few years leaving his girlfriend, (Gillian Anderson), his mom and his dad.  When he finds out that his mom  and dad are getting a devorce many exciting events occur, (Idon't want to  give away the hole movie).  All in all, the acting was great, the plot was  very good and you should see this movie.",950140800,5,407,4.153846153846154
