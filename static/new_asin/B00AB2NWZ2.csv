5408577,5,B00AB2NWZ2,"The period from the late forties to the early sixties was a golden age of Hollywood westerns, and FROM HELL TO TEXAS is one of the true classics from that period.  It's not well known because Don Murray is not one of the big stars of that period.  But it is well written, photographed and directed (by Henry Hathaway) and features a great supporting cast, including Chill Wills, R.G. Armstrong, John Larch, Dennis Hopper and Jay C. Flippen.  And now it's available from Koch in Germany as an anamorphic widescreen release.  Don't miss this one.",1321660800,9,544,4.6947368421052635
