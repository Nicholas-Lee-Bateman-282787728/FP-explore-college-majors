8580002,1,B00CBNV4UO,"""Supertanker"" (also known as ""Super Tanker"" or ""Battle Tanker"") is one of SyFy's very worst movies, and that's saying something. I watched this first over a year ago but was so disgusted with it I'm just finally able to contemplate reviewing it now. This is a film that knows nothing about the military, though repeatedly makes the point the military consists of nothing but bad guys, and even has a completely insulting subplot about the Medal of Honor that justifies a one star review by itself.

The film starts with a terrible premise and nonsensical science, and couples it with a ridiculous script, inept direction, bad sets and effects, and painful acting to result in something that I actually had a hard time finishing. (Given the movies I have seen, that is also saying something.) Seriously, ""Bermuda Tentacles"" is orders of magnitude better than this. Colonel Hanley (Atanas Srebrev) is the bad guy in chief, while Adam (Callum Blue) is the sensitive brainy hero who left magnetic containment science because it was being used by the evil military to make weapons. The obligatory romance is especially saccharine, and is between Adam and Morgan (Jon Mack...yes, that's not a typo, it is a woman's name in this case), and you just know that they are bound to be torn asunder by a ridiculous dramatic conclusion. (You'd be right.)

Anyway, they decide to put this Cold War relic doomsday weapon (ICE-10) made from a meteor on a supertanker and sink it in the Marianas Trench, which will save all humanity. It's an unusual tanker, what with its bulk cargo hatches and self-unloading boom, but never mind; it's the most credible part of the movie (certainly better than the airplane related special effects). The ship's Captain Spyrou is played by SyFy and B-movie regular Velizar Binev, and he's the best actor in the ensemble; contrast him with the Press Secretary (Sarah Brown) who turns in easily the worst performance here, and you'll see what I mean.

Through an epic sea voyage, the supertanker manages to make a giant antimatter cloud that's drifting towards Honolulu, and a team of magnetic containment specialists are called in, though they are for some reason disproportionately intimidated by Colonel Hanley (who is trying to be the bargain bin Steven Seagal here). As if there isn't enough going on we are introduced to a comic relief Asian specialist named Jackie (Jacky Woo) and the running joke (""What'd he say?"") about his accent wears out its welcome nearly instantly. After a nearly unbearable White House press conference and hilarious airliner scene (I didn't think anything could top the awfulness of the C-17 scene at the opening of the film) we get a lot of science babble about how the ship is venting ""death clouds"" whenever they do whatever it is that they're doing. Finally the former CIA agent Robert Jordan (Ben Cross) spills the beans about the death clouds in a scene that will confirm Sarah Brown as a dreadful actress, certainly the worst in this movie. You simply will not believe the level of technobabble that ensues, as they reveal the plan is to sink the ship with the ICE-10 by filling it with concrete. No, reallyI know, I know, they are surrounded by water, which is a more effective and much easier method of scuttling a ship, but that wouldn't allow for cast members to get trapped by concrete below decks and to die heroically. Of course Adam and the Colonel have an unlikely meeting of the minds as we get this message: ""I have been authorized to implement secondary protocol!"" Oh, whatever.  There is much drama: shootings, frantic typing to manually control magnetic fluxes, and the aforementioned Medal of Honor plotpoint that made me physically cringe. ""There's a small matter of a tactical nuke headed towards us!"" is another point loudly made that would normally make an audience sit up and take notice, but here only serves to further distract and make viewers look at their watches to see how much longer this is. I recommend you pay it no heed.

Despite a lot of melodrama (How many times can Morgan call Adam ""baby""? I lost count.) and constant warnings about the extreme instability of the ICE-10 they elect to sink the ship by setting off explosive charges on its deck; there's also a highly probably helicopter versus missile encounter that you must see to believe. Amid ponderous dialogue like ""We're sitting on a million Hiroshimas here!"" and some of the worst editing I have ever seen in any movie ever (watch for the cemetery), the film resolves as you knew it would if minus a couple of the cast members that started with us what seems about two weeks ago, but was only really 83 minutes earlier. The DVD wraps up with a very poor behind the scenes feature (in the infinitesimal chance you'd want to see more) and a photo gallery.

Velizar Binev carries the cast here, but there's not much he can do to save the movie no matter how hard he tries: this is a nonsensical, boring, pretentious, ponderous, and almost unbearable excuse for a movie, and is truly one of SyFy's worst ever.",1473724800,,5054,4.796785304247991

8580004,1,B00CBNV4UO,"Imagine a film company that gets its ideas from Asylum, but lacks their budget and writing skill. Also titled ""Battle Tanker"" is a horrendous film on all accounts.
A substance from a meteor lands in Alaska and is fabricated into a doomsday bomb that becomes unstable if moved too quickly through the earth's magnetic field. Following some plot continuity issues, it was decided to dump this device into the Marianas Trench by way of a huge tanker. In route the tanker has issues with ""rogue waves"" which causes the device known as ICE-10 to become unstable.

This leads to a venting of a deadly cloud. The civilians are at odds with the military as to how to handle the unstable device. This creates added drama.
The science behind the whole film was terrible, as was the less than fifth grade knowledge of nuclear reactors on part of the writers.

They did manage to eliminate Asylums' problem with Navy insignias by not using any at all.

No-f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1367712000,6,968,4.715976331360947
