8041360,5,B0006FO8IE,"Wow, this is a must have for all violin, viola, cello players. This is just the sort of information I've been needing! I'm rhythm challenged, and have had some difficulty learning to use a metronome.  Julie starts out by explaining how to use the metronome, and how each note fits between ticks and on ticks. She goes into wonderful detail on building on rhythms, and exercises you can do to practice.

Anything by her is wonderful. She has an excellent DVD on the ergonomics of  using your instrument that is also a must have.",1454371200,,527,4.585106382978723

8041362,5,B0006FO8IE,"This was such a new way to approach the study of rhythmn  on the violin. Actually Ms. Lieberman got to the essence of how we function rhythmically without having a bow in our hands. Rhythmic training begins before, during and after developing a bow hold. How we train the brain ws addressed.

  I enjoyed the progression of information. Her clear speaking is a plus in this educational recording and the cordial presentation helps welcome those new to the concepts. At first I wondered why I wasn't playing from a chart or score at the beginning of the DVD. Then I realized that core information was being given regarding how we develop our every rhythmic sensibility in playing. The call and response portions provided enough interactiveness, similar to a live lesson.

  I will be incorporating many of the materials into my teaching and playing. So many helpful suggestions were included that I'll have plenty of material to digest and disseminate for and with my students. I appreciated the musical interludes between chapters as they demonstrated some of the many varieties of rhythmic playing available but underutilized by most string players.

  After decades of playing and teaching this was a fascinating and relevant body of information that I think no string teacher, professional or student should be without!

  Ms. Lieberman is known to be an authority in many aspects of World, American and ""Alternative"" styles and I hope she continues to supply those of us on a narrower path with these insightful and educational resources.",1110758400,21,1542,5.047430830039525
