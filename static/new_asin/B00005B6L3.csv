7936792,1,B00005B6L3,I bought this video off ebay and regret it. There are a couple good crashes here and there but 90% are filler. ie: Vert skater bailing on a frontside air and sliding down on his kneepads...wth...save your money and time.,1208995200,,220,4.525

7936795,3,B00005B6L3,"Oh well, maybe didn't do a good job of spelling my review title, but it looks okay.  Same thing goes for the DVD - it's okay.  The cover looks as though there is a lot of mountain bike footage but it is lumped together with the bmx (bmx is cool, don't get me wrong) but altogether, I'd say there is less than 2 minutes of mountain biking in there.
The other diciplines like in-line, surfing, etc. are great.  I guess I just wish there was more mountain biking to it.  If you do want to get, I would probably suggest getting it used.",1043366400,,532,4.135922330097087
