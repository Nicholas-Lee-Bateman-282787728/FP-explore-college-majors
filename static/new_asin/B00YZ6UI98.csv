Being female I get turned off by scene after scene of blood and guts. Yes we know that's what war is like by I don't want it shoved in my face.  This is a story the ladies  won't walk out of the room on. 1962 Oscar Winner for Best  Cinematography (Black and White) and Best special effects.  Oh my goodness so many wonderful well known actors in this film! On the cover Henry Fonda, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.  In the movie: Sean Connery, Eddie Albert, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner and many more. Real men, real war, great acting, an absorbing drama.  (Lots of eye candy for the ladies too LOL).",1496275200,,734,4.321167883211679
