2181778,5,B0006B9784,"This film played to a soldout audience at the Hamptons International Film Festival and I didn't meet a soul who did not love this film.  I've been anxiously awaiting a commercial release, but looks like it is now on DVD.  ""Proteus"" is odd (the timeline zig-zags centuries and can be confusing, much the way Derek Jarman's ""Edward II"" plays with your sense of time) but the film maker explained he wanted to shoot the film on the actual island where it took place, Robbins Island, which is the very same place Nelson Mandella spent 30 years in prison.  He noted that he couldn't avoid the 20th Century intrusions, so he just let them be part of the story.  The film is very dense in its images and levels, such as the three women court stenographers/translators who are plucked out of the 60s.  They struggle to translate the actual 17th century court case transcripts from Dutch, Afrikan and English, and the time period of course reflects when Mandella was sentenced to prison.  The sex scenes between the two leads are fantastically photographed without be graphic in the least, and the ending is noble and moving.  This is a film for anyone into serious gay film.",1100822400,15,1166,4.686274509803922
2181779,2,B0006B9784,"This film is by the man who brought us the fascinating ""Zero Patience.""  One critic compared this film to ""Swoon"" and ""The Living End.""  I think that's accurate.  This is a typical homoerotic film that is nice-looking despite its non-Hollywood budget.
Though supposedly based on a real story, the film is purposely anachronistic.  For example, two Napoleonesque European soldiers drive a jeep into a scene.  The anachronisms are meant to be artsy.
I thought this movie would basically say that in a rampantly homophobic time and in a trenchantly racist region, an interracial [...] male couple are true risk takers.  However, this film was a lot of very little.  I found myself yawning all the way through it.  I really think this work was just made to show graphic guy-on-guy action between a blond and a continental African.",1099958400,10,826,4.934782608695652
2181780,2,B0006B9784,"While this film is beautifully costumed and the setting is gorgeous - I just couldn't get into it. I will often watch movies all the way through even if they don't grab me but the combination of Dutch & English with poor subtitling, modern anachronisms and poor pacing made me switch it right off.",1316563200,,297,4.518518518518518
2181781,5,B0006B9784,"Different concept from what I thought but good movie. Gay love is hard to grasp a times. The two lovers never stated a relatinship, maybe never knew what they were/had..but the ending..WOW. I watched it twice!",1292198400,,209,4.833333333333333

2181784,4,B0006B9784,"According to the radio interview the directors Jack Lewis and John Greyson gave that is included on the DVD, they shot PROTEUS in 18 days with not a lot of money. Although the film is a little rough around the edges and there is one shot too many of closeups of flowers, what these directors have produced is well worth seeing and has a scary but necessary message. History, if we are not careful, repeats itself. Racism and homophobia have been around for far, far too long. Those individuals who believe in diversity should be ever vigilant. Today's hard-won freedoms may be gone tomorrow.

Based on true events from 1735, a black man from South Africa and a white from the Netherlands meet in a prison camp and have a relationship for seventeen years although their affair is shortened to ten years in the movie. Their love for each other possesses them although they do not have a name for what they are experiencing. The officials know of their relationship almost from its beginning but look the other way for a number of years.

Although these events took place in the 18th century, when for a time parts of Holland appear to be as liberal today (the Homomonument honoring the gay people who died in the Holocaust is located in Amsterdam), we should never forget the strides that gay people had made in Germany just before the rise of Hitler nor the attitudes of the Religious Right in the United States today.

A movie well worth watching.",1175040000,5,1447,4.622568093385214
2181785,2,B0006B9784,".......but lands about as high as a pothole in hell.

This movie could have been spectacular. The subject matter in itself is incredible; there was no need for abstract artistic embellishments. What results for the viewer is a cesspool of poorly filtered facts, annoying translations (and attempts at translations), basement-budget cinematography, and bizarre blendings of time and space.  The lead actors are fairly good in their craft, but they're cast into a horrible retelling of a rather interesting historical event.

I wish that this movie could be remade with a less ""artistically innovative"" agenda. I'm pretty sure that very few people have ever known about this obscure incident in history, but it's a great story and definitely worthy of being told. However, the makers of this film lent no justice to the cause.

Since the plot has already been discussed in other reviews here, I don't see the need to address in mine. The eroticism is suttle and innocent, rather than blatant or objectionable. For those who are allured by erotic content and expect anything close to pornography, be advised that such content is extremely minimal, to the lowest degree. The nudity is PG-13 in only one scene and if you blink during the scene, you can reduce the rating of the whole film down to PG, because all that's left is simulated sensuality throughout the remainer of the movie. If you are not deterred by that fact, the movie is solid, except for absurd interludes that pop up here and there.

I was very excited by everything I had read about ""Proteus"" before I actually saw it. I'm still hoping that another talented filmmaker will pick up the gauntlet and give the proper recognition that this lesser known moment in history deserves.",1154995200,4,1741,4.928327645051194
2181786,3,B0006B9784,"This movie stuggles under it's own weight and ends up coming accross as poorly executed. Good performances and an interesting story balance out the technical flaws though and make it a film worth seeing, but not worth owning.

My biggest problem is with the subtitles. They are tiny and white, making them very hard to read.

I also couldn't get past the digital video look of the production. The lack of texture seen with DV does no justice to Grayson's directing style, which is in fact quite lyrical.

Lastly, the intentional anachronism, rather than being effective in making any point comes off as merely affectation.",1153872000,,622,4.904761904761905
2181787,1,B0006B9784,What were they thinking when they made this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! All I can say is don't waist your time watching it.,1152576000,2,114,4.75
2181788,5,B0006B9784,"SO MANY ISSUES ARE TOUCHED IN THIS TRUE STORY

RACISM, SEPARATISM, HOMOPHOBIA, SOCIAL ISSUES, HISTORICAL ISUES.

NOT ALL ISUES CAN BE EXPLORED IN DETAIL, AS THIS FILM IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. IT GIVES THE VIEWER A GOOD IDEA OF THE PROBLEMATICS OF THE ERA, THE LONGING FOR COMPANIONSHIP IN A PRISON.

IT DOES HAVE THE ROMANTIC ELEMENT, REPRESSED LOVE, NEEDY LOVE, SELFISH LOVE. THE CHARACTERS CREATE A BOND, A LOYALTY, THROUGH THE YEARS, AND THEIR LIVES HAVE NO MEANING WITHOUT EACH OTHER.

DONT EXPECT A ROMANTIC COMEDY, OR GREAT LOVE AND DRAMATIC MANIFESTATIONS. IN THIS FILM, LOVE IS SHOWN SEXUALLY, WITH ACTIONS, AND ATTITUDES, IN A AN UNSOPHISTICATED WAY.",1138924800,3,656,4.990825688073395
2181789,4,B0006B9784,"PROTEUS is a valiant film made on a very small budget in a shooting period of 18 days filmed on location on Robben Island in South Africa, the location of the historical trial of two gay men in 1735 and the place where Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.

Writers and directors John Greyson and Jack Lewis have studied the documents of the trial that resulted in the execution of Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands) and Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown), two men who were imprisoned  on Robben Island from 1718 and 1735. Jacobsz was a Dutch sailor from Amsterdam, sentenced for homosexuality and Blank was a Hottentot sentenced to 10 years hard labor for a crime he did not commit.  The two meet, share food, and fall in love, and live in a gay relationship for years (in reality 17 years but for the purposes of the film, 10 years).  Blank earns money from a botanist Virgil Niven (Shaun Smythe), a scientist who fled from Amsterdam to South Africa to study and cultivate Proteus plants, in fear of returning to Amsterdam because of a change in the milieu for gay acceptance.

Jacobsz and Blank are eventually caught en flagrante, arrested, tortured, and when Jacobsz finally admits to their affair, Blank (who is under the protection of his 'guardian' Niven and therefore has the possibility of pardon) acquiesces because of his devotion to Jacobsz and the two are taken to sea where they are drowned as execution.

The film is raw and while there is little in the way of depiction of sexual encounters, there is much to show the difficult life and mode of existence on Robben Island prison.  In part because of the desire to capture on site this moment in South African history and in part simply due to the idiosyncratic choices of the directors, the film places portions of the pictorialization in contemporary times (jeeps, mouthy 1960s' dressed female court stenographers, altered costumes for some of the characters, etc).  For this reviewer these were not distractions but instead lent a sense of timelessness to this historical tale: little has changed in many of the courts' views about gay relationship.

As an added very important and informative feature of this DVD there is a radio broadcast interview of Greyson and Lewis by a San Jose, CA NPR radio station.  In the interview many of the intricacies of the plot of the film are explained as are many of the implications of the tainted court decision which allowed the long-term relationship between Jacobsz and Blank to proceed for many years unfettered until politics raised its ugly head.

The film is in Africaans, English, Dutch, and some Hottentot language and the subtitles are fairly inadequate to follow the line of the story.  The musical score is simple and supportive (one other idiosyncrasy is the moment of playing Mozart on a portable stereo in a wealth home ...).  The overall effect of honesty and devotion to the cause of enlightening the audience to the plight of repressed peoples is very touching: any flaws become slight in the presence of this kind of filmmaking.

8041112,2,B0006B9784,"Lavishly unhurried time-lapse shots of Protea slowly, sooo slowly bloom, overlaid w/ faux 18th century calligraphy signifying nothing, then layered with boxes of hand-drawn letters telling us who did the casting & whatnot.  Could some naif imagine us to be impressed? It's rare to see a film where the art direction--the typography in particular--for the title sequence is this amateurish and just plain tacky.  The message, however, is abundantly clear: reach grossly exceeds this lot's grasp.

After about a catnap's worth of that folderol, three dudes in duds vintage c. 1750--tricorn hats and the full drag--drive up in a Toyota Landcruser FJ40 to take away a skinny black guy for a mid-20th century variation on waterboarding. Ten excruciating minutes have passed while I haven't reported an eighth of the loopy absurdity, let alone the random shifts in dialogue from Afrikans to English and/or possibly Old Dutch, both with and w/o subtitles.  Beg pardon?  This is meant to be the rendering of a true story of tragic man-love in colonial Africa?

All too blatantly, the moviemaker has seen a great deal of the films of Derek Jarmin, Peter Greenaway, and their ilk, and gets off on imagining he is breaking new ground, if not inventing an entirely new genre of arty-farty queer filmmaking. He's not. He's pulling his (flaccid) pud. How this dog's breakfast made it all the way to my flat screen is a great puzzlement.

Update.

Fast-forward to the least erotic, likely most grotty scene of two guys rutting one has yet encountered anyplace--as a botanist, possibly the great Linnaeus himself who named the Proteus flower, secretly watches. Uh . . . right.

Yikes! Here come (again!) the bad 60s bouffant do's dredged from a John Waters nightmare of three typist/stenographer/harpies transcribing the 18th century courtroom scenes, bickering how to translate the naughty bits, and one can only suppose, standing in for a Greek chorus.  Somebody must have made a sillier movie sometime, somewhere, but dang! It would be darn difficult to top this howler of a bow-wow.

The extra star allows the possibility that, given the right company and enough judgment-impairing substances, the movie might well hold more amusement value than it allowed a stone cold sober solo viewer.  It does indeed reach those rarified extremes of awful that could go either way.  Got to give it that.",1328313600,,2379,5.069230769230769
8041113,3,B0006B9784,"What could have been a great film is in the end done in by its own artiness.  Incredibly moving story, terrific performances by Rouxnet Brown and Neil Sandilands, and beautiful photography can't over overcome the use of anachronisms to drive home the movie's message.  Yes, violent homophobia, racism, and brutality are as timeless as love, and every bit as alive in the 21st century as they were as in the 18th, but the message is driven home with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.  The audience doesn't need to have typewriters, radios, and plastic bags coexisting with period costumes to get the point.  We can figure it out on our own quite nicely.

Too bad director John Greyson and his cowriter Jack Lewis couldn't have left well enough alone and told their story in a straightforward manner.  What a film that would have been!",1321574400,,833,4.75
