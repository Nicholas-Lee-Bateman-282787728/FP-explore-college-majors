6396350,5,B00JXBLK5G,"Episodes 14-16 finish up the teenage years plot and 17 skips us forward to the characters' mid twenties. The friends have drifted apart into their sperate lives. But they are brought back together when something starts happening in the monster rat community. This builds up to a shocking event that shatters the peace and safety of their village, leading them to take desperate steps towards survival.

I was hooked on this series after the first episode. But I didn't realize the ambitious scope of the series until the end. There are 4 basic plot lines and each one brings up different difficult issues. This set wraps up Mamoru's plot and deals with the terrifying question  - if you are certain that your village wants you dead and certain that you can't survive outside of the village, what do you do? The last plot line is the most ambitious, dealing with themes like sentience and freedom.

From the New World was based on a novel and is 25 episodes long. This set contains the final 12 episodes.",1398902400,16,1003,4.6875

8654375,5,B00JXBLK5G,"I love this anime! I'd say this has to be one of my Top 5 Anime. I enjoyed seeing a story set in the near future where we learn about the changes and development society has experienced through the eyes of a fully rounded character. Also, if you haven't heard of this anime before than you are in for a treat because this is sort of an unexpected surprise because it is unlike much of anything else out there. I wouldn't go as far as to call this completely original and unique, it still follows some common themes in anime, but the progression of the story and dilemmas are entirely their own. Please make sure to give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1474243200,,659,4.32258064516129
8654376,1,B00JXBLK5G,"I love anime but this show sucks so bad, i was so depressed because i actually watched the whole thing hoping ot would get better. The only good thing about this show is the 1 scene of mild lesbian action that lasted for like 20 seconds, other than that, thia show sucks so bad",1459209600,,277,4.148148148148148

8654378,4,B00JXBLK5G,"This is a very interesting series with a thought provoking plot, but one major glaring problem at the end.

This show is set 1000 years in the future and follows the lives of 5 preteen schoolchildren.  The human race has evolved powerful telekinetic powers and the people live in what seems to be an idyllic society with a low level of technology.  Advanced technology is no longer needed due to their ability to manipulate the environment with their powers.  The show skips ahead years in the lives of the schoolchildren multiple times as they discover some of the hidden secrets and perils of their civilization.  While there is a fair amount of action, I would describe the show as being more plot and character driven.  I think of the theme as being ""childhood's end"" or ""loss of innocence"".

*** Moderate Spoiler ***

Once you finish the show, there is a big problem with the ending.  Contrast the monster rat general Kiromaru's description in episode 22 of his tribe's battle with how the ogre was dealt with in the last episode.  Big glaring oops.",1452384000,,1054,4.7103825136612025
8654379,5,B00JXBLK5G,"Don't let the ""cute"" cover fool you. This is a straight up 18+ anime. It is very dark and probably one of the best dystopian horror/thrillers I have seen yet. The story centers around a group of kids from age 12 to age 30+ in a future society. The only anime I have seen that is darker or more tragic than this is Berserk. There is no filler. There is no fan service. There are a few short gay scenes of the kids when they were younger. One of the best sci-fi series I have ever watched. You have to watch it in subtitles though. The group who did the dub is just terrible (trust me).

Pros:
Art
Story is top notch
No fan service
Adapted from a book
Dark/Tragic/Horror/Adventure/Supernatural
It's so good, I recommend a 2 day recovery period.

Cons:
The dub is bad, and I prefer dub over sub.
The subtitles seem to have been changed a bit for an American audience, however, the story is still intact.
The cover : I feel bad for all the kids under 18 who stumbled across this film.",1428883200,5,980,4.235294117647059
8654380,5,B00JXBLK5G,"To any who say anime is just cartoons or just plain unrealistic need's to see this series,yes it's animated but the story in it could apply to anyplace in the world. It's about how those in power treat those who they consider less, even going so far. As to physically change them so that they match there preconceived idea of not me not mine,and their reaction to not only their repressed who say we are not animals we demand equal rights,and humane treatment but also those of there own family and citizens who say we agree this isn't right or who we say we are there protest were answered you are not like us you never were nor will you ever be,you deserve nothing but what we chose to give you even your life is a gift we give you so be grateful. So like so many other's the oppressed take there freedom,respect and pride at the end of a sword and change there world forever.",1425772800,2,878,4.295180722891566
8654381,5,B00JXBLK5G,"Not only one of the best of the season, but truly one of the best I've ever watched. I'm beyond happy I added this title to my collection right from jump street and frankly, knew very little about it beforehand.

The writing is exemplary, the artwork is absolutely astounding from the first scene to the last, the score is wonderful and was thought out and well placed long before laying the audio tracks, the characters are easy to like and understand...some you simply have to love almost immediately. The whole series is both sad and happy, funny and serious. Its touches most emotions in the spectrum but in the end left me feeling completely satisfied. So few have strong endings anymore - and while FTNW certainly ""does its own thing"" several times and explores routes that are hard to follow or understand at times, it doesn't leave it as such and wraps up everything quite nicely.

Again, one of the best out there - I highly recommend adding to the collection of any anime fan, with no reservations!",1414108800,10,1008,4.657303370786517
