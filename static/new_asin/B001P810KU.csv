8332463,4,B001P810KU,"I have been searching for years for this DVD since watching it on Discovery. I was told it would never be released due to the content which I could never understand. The content is real life as it was, without these Machines of Malice we would not be enjoying certain aspects of life as we do. Highly recommended!",1369785600,,313,4.413793103448276
