The gun is a symbol of freedom, the only thing that keeps the government from taking over.  It really has nothing to do with guns; it has to do with freedom.  Do you give your freedom to the government or do you keep it within yourself, within your community, within your family?  And thats the appeal.

The above comes from a former National Rifle Association (NRA) spokesman and is found in this powerful and informative documentary.  There is a message right at the beginning that this documentary that states that it may not be suitable for all audiences and thus viewer discretion is advised.

This documentary was televised on January 6, 2015.  It is an episode of Frontline.  Frontline is a public affairs television program that produces and broadcasts in-depth documentaries about various subjects.  It has been critically acclaimed and has received numerous awards.  Since its inception, there have been almost 600 films broadcast.

The reason I obtained this particular documentary is that I read the negative reviews of it on this site.  Thus, I knew it had to be good.  And sure enough, it was goodvery good!!

Quite simply, this film reveals the history of how the NRA came to dominate the U.S. gun debate.  The viewer gets to follow the NRAs political evolution (through archival footage) and see how it consistently succeeded in defeating new gun control legislation.  The facts presented in this film are astounding.  (One fact that I found fascinating was that the NRA was once a safety organization.)

This documentary draws on brief interviews with leading voices on both sides of the gun regulation debate.  We get to sit down with Congressional leaders, present & former White House officials, Vice-president Joe Biden and, gun-rights & gun-control advocates.  Featured are firsthand accounts from eye-witnesses and from family members of mass shooting victims.

Some of the more famous shootings presented in this film are:

(1) At an outdoor shopping center where Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot
(2) The Columbine massacre
(3) Assassinations of the 1960s: JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King
(4) The shootings of former President Ronald Reagan and his press secretary James Brady
(5) The Sandy Hook School massacre where seven and eight year olds were gunned down

Finally, the title of this review is a quotation from one of the NRAs top leaders that was made right after the Sandy Hook massacre of children.

In conclusion, this is astounding and disturbing documentary which presents a history of the National Rifle Association and brings you up-to-date on mass killings from guns.

The producers at Frontline did a great job highlighting and exposing the powerful influence the NRA's leadership and the rest of the gun lobby has on members of Congress, as well as the American people. This was not meant to be a hit piece on the NRA or its members (even though it comes off that way), but a microscope on how the organization is able to exert influence and put pressure on politicians to do what they want. If they don't do what they want, those individuals are put in the crosshairs (almost quite literally) for political destruction and possibly career-ending consequences to work in government ever again. As history shows, the politicians that don't tow the line for pro-gun enthusiasts, are punished in more ways than one.

First and foremost, all politicians are given an ""NRA rating,"" which gives people a simple percent number rating on how much they support or oppose gun rights, based on the various types of gun legislation they have voted on. If their votes are contrary to what the NRA approves of, they are given a lower rating. Second, that leads them to being targeted for TV/radio ad campaigns and mailers that tell people to vote for the politicians that support gun rights instead. So they take action in forcing people to understand that if these people are not doing exactly what you want legislatively on gun rights, they need to be ousted from their positions, even if their efforts are sincere in helping save lives. With the heavy money backing of gun lobbyists and members, the NRA has the financial power to push any narrative it wants about anybody and that's shown in the film.

Yes, it's certainly true that there was an emotional element depicted in the movie, but that doesn't mean PBS or Frontline is biased against the NRA. Instead, it was shown that the American people, who are affected by gun violence are the ones experiencing the most amount of trauma, which producers of the film attempted to gauge when interviewing parents of the kids killed in Columbine and Sandy Hook. Furthermore, the NRA was represented very well in the movie, as several of their board members and advocates were allowed to give their take and defend the organization. Even Larry Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America (a more conservative gun group), was able to give his take, as well.

So while viewers may disagree with the angle of the film, and the way they showed regular people (and even politicians) expressing emotion, it was basically capturing the human element of what guns can do to those people and hit them where it hurts physically and emotionally. Gun violence is a problem. Period. 32,000+ gun deaths in America is not something that should be taken lightly, but it is because of the influence of the NRA, and unless there are real solutions (and less misinformation or scare tactics) put out there to stop that problem, these atrocities will continue. Frontline showed viewers that reality and I commend them for it.",1441584000,2,3010,4.795761078998074
8693535,2,B00R041CQK,"Please don't dismiss my criticism of this movie as that of a bitter gun nut. I'm a pretty strong advocate of gun control laws, but this video simply doesn't have much depth. It relies on emotional appeal over facts and expert opinion. To take one instance, there is not a ""gun show loophole,"" as the video repeatedly says. There is a dangerous loophole in our laws-- private sellers do not have to conduct background checks, while licensed dealers do everywhere they sell weapons. This is a major problem, but it has nothing to do with gun shows per se.
Gunned Down is barely  worth even the dollar I spent on it.

For a balanced,comprehensive overview on this subject, I suggest Adam Winkler's book Gunfight. He presents a non ideological evaluation of the arguments on both sides.",1431561600,7,782,4.742647058823529
8693536,1,B00R041CQK,As much as I enjoy frontline this documentary was skewed to the anti gun from the beginning. Good documentaries should be neutral depictions and not meant to lead viewers towards a bias. I am not a gun nut but you can do better pbs.,1427328000,10,232,4.295454545454546
8693537,1,B00R041CQK,"I don't have a gun, don't know how to use a gun and could care less to touch a gun or own a gun but many in my surroundings do have guns and love their guns. When Al Gore counted the votes, it was 50 YES and 50 NO. It was not 50 BLUE or 50 RED. Guns are matter of a principle to many citizens of United States of America, so let's not make it an issue of RED or BLUE. It is about what Americans want, and how Americans vote regardless if they are a members of NRA or not a member of NRA. It is not based on those few citizens who choose to make documentaries with their own agenda while ignoring the rest of the country who go through the voting process. If that NRA representative is that qualified in manipulating votes in his favor in US Congress, then Republicans or Democrats better hurry and get him in their camp ASAP. Those reps in US Congress vote in the interest of their constituents otherwise they will not have a job, a high income job with a great pension plan regardless of their political beliefs. To ignore the wish of American citizens who vote accordingly to protect their gun rights as brainwashed entities by NRA is nothing but a pure manipulation from the producers of this PBS documentary not NRA.

Showing a public official shedding tears for those innocent individuals who lost their lives by the senseless acts of those mentally disturb individuals but yet discrediting Americans who may have a gun or may not have a gun, who may belong to NRA or may not belong to NRA, who still felt as much pain if not more, is a very one sided and distasteful act by the producers of this PBS documentary. Talk about manipulation...

UPDATE 6/14/2016
The Indiana man James Wesley Howell who was arrested couple days ago on Sunday before a gay pride event in Los Angeles, possessed an explosive device along with three rifles, a black hood, handcuffs, a security guard badge, a Taser and additional ammunition, according to new details released by the Los Angeles County District Attorneys office. Well there we go again. Officials are after law abiding citizens to lose their right for carrying guns but they will not address criminals who are breaking the laws or the rules governing those criminals who commit crime with their guns. That is what those union employees of any government are all about more agencies, more unions but certainly and more importantly less and less rights for law abiding citizens of this country. Dealing with the affects instead of the cause sure attracts many with no brains who support those crooked politicians with no intention other than using their brain for their own financial gain. Corrupt, incompetent and worthless.",1424649600,12,2670,4.607142857142857
