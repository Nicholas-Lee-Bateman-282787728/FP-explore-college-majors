3916731,5,B002EBRF7O,This was an outstanding buy for the money. Disks came in a very ingenious box that helps save space on my DVD rack. Fitting 7 DVDs in a double-size DVD case is great. The quality of the set is just top notch. Crisp video and audio. This was an awesome addition to the original SAC set. Another great deal from Amazon.,1264723200,18,317,4.213114754098361
3916732,5,B002EBRF7O,"In Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex series one, the primary villains of the series act through proxies and never really reveal themselves.

In season two, we are introduced to a real villain, a product of future Japan's equivalent of the CIA.

Much as in series one, series two involves a shadow war between the good guys (represented by Section 9) and the bad guys (who also have their own place in the government of Japan).

I would say that the main difference between the two series is that series two is less focused on flashy technology (highly advanced technology is a big mover in the plot) and more on John le Carr type shadow warfare between the powerful Section 9 and their adversaries who may be even more powerful in their mastery of the future's complicated technology.

Anyway, I certainly recommend this series to fans of the Ghost in the Shell universe, and too people who like their spy stories with a healthy dose of grimness.",1264204800,61,952,4.648809523809524

3916736,5,B002EBRF7O,"As one of the premier Manga series internationally, Ghost In the Shell aka S.A.C., has introduced North American animation fans to a dangerous view of the future.

While S.A.C. occurred in the `near' future, 2nd Gig, and the annotated film, Individual Eleven takes place in 2032.  Prior to the dissolution of  Section 9, and the resignation of Major Kusangi, the world experienced two `world' word from 2000-2015, and 2015 to 2024.  The use of nuclear weapons marked the end of WWIII, and the consequent threat by the American Empire to do so again had kept the global forces in Japan at bay.  As Section 9 winds down, a new threat rises.  The increase in independent states and sovereign regions that grew from the chaos of the last 30 years has led to a divided planet with major questions on sovereignty and administrative jurisdiction.

As the director said in an interview, ""In other words, we simply couldn't ignore the way society had evolved since the events of 9-11 That was the approach we decided to take, and I tried to illustrate a 21st century (near-future) war. But to tell you the truth, I couldn't avoid feeding back into modern reality.""  Given the war torn climate in Section 9 and the circumstances the Japanese people find themselves in a complex discussion of the reactions and actions of both the military and militants was the only possible scenario for the series.

The complexity of the 26 episodes, 2nd season, is simplified in the motion picture, ""Individual Eleven"".  While the original episodes contain a more dynamic, more in-depth plot flow than the 160 minute film, the full 700 minute presentation is equally spectacular.  With such a complex storyline, the editing and directoral decisions required  for the short version must have been hellish.  The resulting 160 minute  `short' is riveting, and leads viewers through a nightmare world of politics, survival, semantics, and loyalties.  As in any time of war, there are aggressors and defenders, and the forces led by the Togusa struggle with suicides, random acts of violence, and seek to uncover the ""Puppet Master"".

Amidst the intense plot driven ""Individual Eleven"" and ""2nd Gig"", several sub plots wind through the main tapestry.

With Section 9 investigating the machinations of the ""Puppet Master"", the Tachikoma's appearance adds another layer to the story.  Similar to the Q Collective in Star Trek, they are robots endowed with sophisticated AI with a little free will and philosophical discussion thrown in.  Ultimately, their sacrifice paves the way for the successful conclusion of the conflict that Kuze controls.

That brings us to another interesting plot line.  Kuze, the lone survivor of the Eleven, fled to the refugee camps and soon became a magnet for other survivors.  His silence, and ability to make cranes with his left hand, served as therapy and those around him offered their life stories.  He disappeared from view, and his relationship with Kusangi was resurrected as both were cybertized.

There are so many themes and plot threads running through this series that a book can be written on them.  Intelligent animation has the power to inspire, and SAC is very intelligent!  The animation style is worthy of an Academy Award, and should be recognized as such.

Look for this amazing series and film at your local video dealer or go online at [...]

I remain,

The entire season itself is 100% complete, including each and every episode of ""Tachikoma Days.""

3916778,4,B002EBRF7O,"It's been a long time since I saw Ghost in the Shell SAC Part One or even the original film so I was looking forward to this. Most of the elements that made Ghost in the Shell famous are still there. Section 9 is re-formed and sets off to deal with another conspiracy. The plot is complex and layered in a number of ways which makes this compelling viewing. The animation and dubbing are good and don't distract from the story telling.

The plot isn't dissimilar from SAC one but at the end it lacks the menace of the first series and the additional peril facing Section 9 isn't present in SAC 2 either. For this reason it's a little weaker than the first series. The episodes which explain the history of some of the team members of Section 9 and their relationship to Major Kusanagi flesh out the characters and compensate for some of the weaknesses of the plot. We even learn some of the Major's history too.

There is a new series of Tachikomatic days which is even more irritating than the original and could easily be missed.",1411257600,3,1031,4.421052631578948

3916784,2,B002EBRF7O,"I absolutely loved the story, animation, and ideas in the first series of Ghost in the Shell.  This second series?  Not so much.

Clearly, this second series was just to cash-in on the popularity of the first.  Very little effort was made to develop the stories.  As a matter of fact, most episodes seem to be simply rip-offs of various movies.  For instance, one episode was a rip-off of the sniper sequence for ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Another episode was a blatant copy of ""Taxi Driver"".  The only difference was the Ghost in the Shell versions lost all the drama and cohesiveness of those movies.  Worse, then had lame tacked-on endings.  They just fizzled.

However, if you loved the original run, you might want to add a star.  Also, the series gave the ""back stories"" of many of the main characters.  Unfortunately, the back stories all seemed kinda lame.  They even touched on a love-interest for the Major.  But then they never develop it to see where it might have lead.  It's just a dead end.

Worse, the scripts are horrible.  They are simply one character just blurting out ten minutes of exposition.  Not really ""story telling"".  Just one character reading an essay more or less.

You might want to rent this instead of buying it...",1401148800,3,1243,4.688372093023256

3916786,5,B002EBRF7O,"Watch the series, both of them, do not just watch the 2 movies they put out.

As well as could be expected there are some discrepancies between the movie versions and the T.V. versions. By-the-by they are both really good, in fact I own both the full T.V. series of ""Stand alone complex"" the first one is about the ""Laughing Man Incident""  and S.A.C. 2nd Gig, which is the second series which is mainly about the individual 11.

The funny thing is I watched the second series and am now going to start the first series.  I am interested to see who tops who!  It will be hard to beat 2nd Gig.  Anything involving the Major is okay for me!",1385078400,,477,3.968421052631579
3916790,4,B002EBRF7O,"I first watched this anime during the Adult Swim era on Cartoon Network.  Originally in English and being young in mind, this anime flew way over my head.  Yet I was impressed with Kenji Kamiyama and team's overall creation of a world that goes into cybernetics and a world where cyber augmentation is the new fashion.  The alternative reality of fragmented nation-states at war with one another, with Japan now as a passive player in world politics, was a neat touch because the 'bad-guy nation/good-guy nation' is ambiguous.  In the meanwhile it does play onto more relevant current events, such as today's Japan's Article 9, which prohibits an aggressive stance during conflicts solve problems.  Also the function of the ""Japanese Miracle"" in the show, or nuclear fallout scrubber technology, shows an inherent throwback desire against nuclear weaponry.  And let's not forget the goofy yet likeable Tachikomas, child-like in their approach to supporting Aramaki's Section 9, yet very intelligent in figuring out the entire plot.

The gist of Volume 2 is the overlying issue of solving the Refugee Action Policy, in which the Japanese government benevolently invited refugees across Asia to settle in their country after the flames of war.  This has caused ethno-tensions between refugees who want rights equal to the citizens of Japan, then bedlam ensues with the culmination of the rise of the ""Individual Eleven,"" a terrorist group with no common affiliations rising with individual terrorist acts that take a statement against the RAP.  The Individual Eleven, though no connection with another, believe that they are doing a service to the nation when at the same time something is afoul in the sudden arise of the group altogether.  Motoko Kusanagi and Section 9 now have to work together to link these attacks to one common source, but eventually run into a major issue of the ""powers of be"" that pull the strings.

The show really does take two or three run-throughs to get the whole concept.  The philosophical dialog, hard to follow in English, is much more novel-like when reading in Japanese subtitles, takes time getting used to.  But the central themes of stand-alone complexes and a society, pretty much cyberized, yet still as a collective desires freedom on a higher level is explored in this anime.  The concept of ""individuality"" is ironic, even though people try to commit acts of violence to make themselves stand out, they really just copy cat one another.  Society as a mass desires to be individualistic, but at the heart of the human heart is a desire for freedom.  Yes, this drama is convoluted at times, but the creative world of cyberpunk Japan is very unique and Kamiyama does it again in giving you brain food to feed that Ghost In the Shell.",1379203200,5,2773,4.982646420824295
3916791,5,B002EBRF7O,"Ghost in the Shell is a great show. I prefer the Laughing Man as a villain, but 2nd Gig has more focus and Kusanagi wears normal pants most of the time, so you can stop thinking, ""Why isn't she wearing something practical?""

3916792,4,B002EBRF7O,"As with the first season the animation is simply gorgeous and the action is top notch. The villain is also a little better this time around, as the Laughing Man from last season was a bit too much of a enigma for his own good. The english dub is as solid as it was last time, and still leaps and bounds ahead of the dub done for the films (which should only be watched in subtitle.)

The one issue, which was also the case for the first season, is that there are a few too many instances of characters effectively stopping the story in order to sit down and talk about the philosophy behind what is going on. The depth of thought is impressive and enjoyable, but the manner in which characters talk about these concepts (i.e. openly and bluntly) is a tad clumsy at times. That didn't stop me from still enjoying this from start to finish.",1377475200,3,838,4.30379746835443

With wars, global warming, failed nation states, I forsee this happening more around the world as people try to escape their fates only to be worse off than before. The infighting of the various governmental departments as they fight over their turfs, bugets, and agendas makes for a realistic story line. I did laugh when the main villian here seems to be the Imperial American Empire. I guess they forgot about their own historical imperial ambitions of their rising sun vision of WWII.

3916807,5,B002EBRF7O,"This is yet another example of Japanese anime at its finest.
Proving that making a second series from an iconic film as 'Ghost In The Shell' is a good move, 2nd Gig fleshes out the characters stories further, the action is just as intense, the suspense and intrigue are fantastic, and the over arching storylines, graphics, soundtrack etc is as awesome as ever.

This set will take you to places you never imagined and intices you to watch it repeatidly so that you find yet more details and aspects that you might have missed the first time round.

Watching this series in a well packaged set of inspiring DVD's borders on a near religious experience.

I still think the laughing man was more interesting, but that;'s because I grew up being a big computer person and knew a few hackers, but this series definitely has the better soundtrack and visuals. The song Cyberbird by Yoko Kanno is amazing and they play it at the perfect times all throughout the series.

I have watched this series twice now, going onto three and I'm still trying to peace together everything and make sense of it. If you ask me normally I would say that sucks for anything, but this series is so good that it's more enjoyable every time, and you figure out or see new things every time you re-watch it.",1355270400,,685,4.393700787401575

3916815,4,B002EBRF7O,"The disks themselves were flawless and played perfectly.  The content is completely immersive and thought provoking.  I love this show.

My only criticism: the case was broken upon receipt.  The design is well thought out to conserve space but the construction could be stronger (or a different layout).  Specifically, the single middle leaf holds several disks and is too heavy for the thickness of the plastic clips holding it into the case.  So I'm guessing the jostling around in shipping broke one of the clips resulting in the leaf now loosely flopping from one clip inside the case.  I'd call it a fluke except that I received GITS:SAC in exactly the same case design - also broken in shipping in the same way (two different shipments).",1295481600,5,743,4.849206349206349
3916816,5,B002EBRF7O,"I paid $15 bucks for these 7 discs and it was definately worth it.  The discs were new.  Also on a side note, my friend swears by using his hairy arm to clean dvds.  I use water and cloth.
Anyway I was very pleased with the plot and I really liked the series better than the first because there were less stand alone episodes and more linked story progression episodes.  Also the animation quality was amazing! and more interesting and detailed animation.  I don't know how long it took to make this series but it was a hell of an effort.  Also props to the director who wanted it to have the feel of a real live action.  It really makes it feel real.  I do reccomend watching the first season's ""complex"" episodes before this series to get the feel for the characters.
I can't really compare this to other anime series, but it is on par with the x-files or investigative type shows.  It is completely original though in it's setting and style which is futuristic sci-fi/detective group and has a lot of background thinking for you to do.  The action is intense and the voice acting great.  If your looking for a solid sci-fi series check it out.  I would recommend this for adults or teenagers.",1288828800,10,1195,4.431192660550459

3916818,5,B002EBRF7O,"Ordered a new copy and it was delivered on time and in excellent condition.

Ghost in The Shell: Anime Legends 2nd Gig, holds up to the Manga standards and reputation Shirow Masamune is known for. Makoto Shimonura, as always, has delivered another fine set of characters in the anime style. My hat is off to the Committee for another fine release.

26 excellant episodes are in this set and included are 26 episodes of Techikomatic Days for a lighter note. Interviews with the cast, director and creative staff is also included but could have been better delivered; I expected better from a creative group but it does keep in line with previous interview sections on their other releases.

Excellent for the student of anime, artists of anime and/or the folks looking for just good entertainment value with action.",1287446400,,814,4.884057971014493
3916819,5,B002EBRF7O,"The story in this is awesome.  There is quite a bit of political intrigue and a fairly deep societal analysis.  The good guys are REALLY GOOD guys and the bad guys are REALLY BAD guys, kinda like a Tom Clancy novel.  If you enjoyed the first season, you will most likely enjoy this one as well.  I enjoyed this season more than the first, but they are both excellent.  The animation is good and the english dub is tollerable.",1287187200,2,425,4.329113924050633

3916821,5,B002EBRF7O,"With the second season of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Section 9 returns once again but this time their entire group has a different agenda.  While in the first season dealing with the ""Laughing Man"", this season seems to take a little more serious tone compared to the first season.  Once again they deal with terrorist, this time it's with a terrorist group calling themselves ""The Individual Eleven"" and trying to start what they call a 'revolution'.  Not only that Section 9, also has to face with refugees that are resorting to suicide bombings to leave their last mark in the world.  I say that the story writing got better for this season though at times its on par with the first season but for the most part it's better than the Season 1 writing.  I definitely recommend this season of Ghost in the Shell for anyone that's a fan of the show let alone the movies.  I give it a 5 stars out of 5.",1277856000,2,914,4.410714285714286

Things to know
 Anamorphic Widescreen I belive means it will adjust to your tv/monitor better.
This is Season 2 of the Animated series.

3916824,5,B002EBRF7O,"When I first purchased these discs over two years ago I paid $20 per disc (x7 discs...)  I want to give Bandai a great big hug for this set.  I love this series and hope as many intelligent people as possible see it.

I won't bore anyone with the details of the plot, story, etc...

Suffice to say, this is a vast improvement over the first series (SAC).  The main antagonist is one of the great characters of anime history (Kuze).  He is neither villain nor hero, but something necessary and in between and the animators and voice actors really bring this out.

The stand alone episodes are rich and entertaining and go to show a lot of each character's history.  The pace is steady and quick without being too fast.  Togusa (my favorite character) really moves into the forefront as one of the three most important characters.

The animation quality is strong and never wavers for a second (like other series who outsource to Korea).  The voice acting is strong in both Japanese and English.  I watch 95% of my anime in Japanese, but I really prefer this series in English for some odd reason!

If you like trippy, mind bending sci fi in the same vein as Blade Runner, Gattaca, and Logan's Run; then you MUST watch this series (and the 2 movies!)",1271203200,,1248,4.493333333333333
3916825,5,B002EBRF7O,"This series is an incredibly rich, deep and thought-provoking story. I watched both seasons over two riveting weeks. If you enjoy animation of any kind or are looking for something daring and different, watch the Ghost in the Shell series, though I'd recommend beginning with season one. If I have a complaint about the storytelling, it is that there is a bit too much exposition is 2nd Gig that wasn't necessary in GitS: SAC. However, this is a minor complaint in an overall brilliant narrative.

The box set is a terrific deal. Video and audio quality are excellent. The package is well designed and keeps all 7 DVDs secure. I really couldn't be happier about this purchase.",1270857600,,676,4.777777777777778

8367503,5,B002EBRF7O,"Fantastic! I absolutely love Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Season 2! The animation for the most part is beautiful and colorful. Some scenes actually look like a painting.  However, as another viewer has mentioned, some of the animation is done rather sloppy for some of the characters in a few scenes. For example, Batou's animation is not consistent in several episodes.  However, the sound is pretty good and I really love the voice actors. There are some episodes that are kind of boring, however, there are a number of episodes that have a lot of suspense, And some of the episodes have cliff hangers. Also, I would say that the last three discs are one big continuous story and flows very well. And there is peril that awaits Section 9 which is part of the seaon finale. If you are a fan of Ghost in the Shell, you have to get this series and season one as well. As a parting note, I am dying for them to make more Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex. They did sort of make a third season and turned it into a movie called  ""Ghost in the Shell Solid State Society.""  That one is pretty good too. Also, is it just me, but I would love to see Batou and the Major have some romance between them. Batou clearly loves the Major.",1503792000,,1240,4.331896551724138
