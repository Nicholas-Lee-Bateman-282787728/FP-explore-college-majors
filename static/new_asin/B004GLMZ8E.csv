4373682,5,B004GLMZ8E,I Got all discs for a great a really great price...... Better deals then I found elsewhere.  Three more words,1376956800,,109,4.45
4373683,5,B004GLMZ8E,"Item arrived as described and quickly. So glad a bought from this seller. The moves are new and some repeats but you do feel more of a burn in targeted areas I really bought this for my abs my butt looks great but it can always get better i am already noticing a bit of a lift, can't wait to get my tiny bubble butt back. Yay!",1376179200,,326,3.8805970149253732
4373684,2,B004GLMZ8E,"Coming from a person who loves Zumba I expected this to be phenomenal. Tanya didn't seem enthusiastic like in the other DVDs, instead it seemed like she was in pain, and wanted to quit. The other dancers seemed miserable as well.

The new dance moves in this series can be dangerous if you're not paying attention to your foot work... Be careful. Overall I wouldn't recommend this DVD series.",1371081600,,392,4.681159420289855
4373685,5,B004GLMZ8E,It arrived quickly and just as described in description. I love these dvds! It's the perfect compliment to the zumba exhilarate bundle. All the workouts are less than 30 minutes so you never have an excuse not to work out!,1370995200,4,222,4.575
4373686,2,B004GLMZ8E,"While I do love the Exhilarate Body Shaping System, I ordered the Target Zones as an addendum to my program.  Unfortunately, it doesn't offer any sort of calendar or workout schedule as to how to incorporate the Target Zone workouts with the larger package. Do I supplement any of the DVD's with this, or do I use it in addition?  No instructions are offered so it's useless to me as far as I'm concerned.",1366848000,,405,4.45945945945946
4373687,5,B004GLMZ8E,I feel that Amazon should have some way to be sure customers are not being cheated.  You can get a whole zumba set including this one for only $80 something.  This is outrageous to try to charge people over $200 for this 3 dvd set.,1366588800,3,231,4.111111111111111
4373688,5,B004GLMZ8E,"I purchased the Exhilirate DVD set, and got this ""Target Zone"" to complement it.  I just can't get enough Zumba!",1355702400,4,112,4.6
8428833,5,B004GLMZ8E,It was new and great price and good workout,1528934400,,43,3.888888888888889

8428837,3,B004GLMZ8E,"I love zumba and I love dancing. This DVD set was quite good, although music wasn't too great and the girls dancing with Tanya seemed so unenthusiastic. I don't know. If I could dance with Tanya, I would at least try to pretend I'm excited. Tanya is super nice as always though. This DVD is great as a once in a while change in Zumba routine",1430697600,2,341,4.181818181818182
8428838,5,B004GLMZ8E,"Love Zumba and this gives me a variety, keeps my interest and keeps me going.  Thanks for the new product.",1391644800,,106,4.3
8428839,5,B004GLMZ8E,This set is amazing! Tanya B. uses all simple and easy to follow core moves to strengthen and tone your body. This is not a Zumba Dance DVD Set. It is exactly what it says it is...she takes you through the program reminding you to focus on your core at all times.,1386806400,2,263,4.076923076923077
8428840,5,B004GLMZ8E,I really like having more Zumba work outs to choose from! These are more short ones to target specific areas.,1379894400,5,109,4.5
8428841,5,B004GLMZ8E,"I've used these as an addition to my other Zumba DVD's. They are still a challenge for me after a few weeks of using them 2x a week. I like the new choreography with the exception of the Israeli folk on the arms and obliques DVD. I like these, not sure what other reviewers saw about the whole ""zombie"" make up on Tonya. I thought she looked just fine. If you love Zumba I recommend these as an addition to your Zumba material collection.",1379635200,2,438,4.226190476190476
8428842,5,B004GLMZ8E,This is a great CD. I have a Zumba class and we follow the CD's. we have a great time doing these 45 min. Programs. We purchase all the Zumba tapes we can find. Amazon has a great variety of Cd's. would recommend them for people of all ages.,1377993600,,241,3.938775510204082
