Pictures are released which flushes them out where thermal cameras are used to track them down. Insightful, has the 'You are there feel'.",1478476800,,314,5.038461538461538
8590251,5,B00D7AM72O,"Not only did Nova do an excellent job of covering this tragedy, they managed to get it together in just over a month's time.

The Boston Marathon was bombed on April 15, 2013, and at first there was very little evidence for who was behind it.  Nova talks to the officials in Boston, to experts in explosives, and others who worked with all the video data taken that day in the area where the bombs went off.  We see how New York City has a better system, but how a number of people recover all the data, pick out suspicious people who were in the area at the time and finally manage to narrow it down to a few, including the two who did it.

  We learn how the suspects were identified, how they were tracked down and finally caught.  It's quite a story, chock full of one scientific miracle after another and the work done by the police and others who are charged with doing the dirty work, the dangerous stuff.

It's a great story:  one for the books for the science, for the human interest, and for those who put it all together and caught the suspects before they could strike again.

Well done, indeed.",1423008000,2,1107,4.304347826086956
