8102489,1,B000DN5VU8,"This movie is a very poor production but also a curious one because the only good thing about it is the monster itself.  Hypnogogic and psychopompic hallucinations (the correct terms) are an ancient problem of mankind.  This film pretends to be fact based yet it does not mention the only known cure for sleep paralysis: hyperventilation which floods the body with oxygen to wake up the brain, since sleep paralysis is caused by one part of the brain being awake while another is asleep.  That said, this topic has great potential and some producer should make a film of gripping horror (I suggest this film's producer find a new line of work).  Readers who wish more information on this topic would do well to read ""Night of the Crusher: The waking nightmare of sleep paralysis propels people into a spirit world"" by Bruce Bower on Science News Online server.",1181606400,2,860,4.751677852348993
8102490,1,B000DN5VU8,Sleep paralysis had some of the worst writing and acting I have seen in a low budget flick in quite some time.  The only thing they did right I thought were the actual scenes of the main character's paralysis which were pretty much dead on from what I have experienced in my own personal life as I have suffered from this affliction for many years.  Watch this one on cable if you get the chance but don't waste a dollar of your money on it.,1147910400,,441,4.176470588235294
