1891818,5,B00009W2LP,"Although the Classical Pilates Technique DVDs were not shot in an exotic location or on a luxurious set, these are the finest Pilates DVDs on the market.  They exhibit the high standards of instruction required of all who were trained in the tradition of Romana Kryzanowska.
I have read in other reviews that the instruction does not focus enough on the Breath and must offer my opinion.  Joseph Pilates himself said: ""Above all, learn to breathe properly.""  By that, Mr. Pilates meant to take full inhalations and complete exhalations.  He believed in a deep lateral breath.  My beginning students are always concerned with when to inhale and exhale and I tell them to be more concerned with how, not when, to breathe. The body will find its own natural pattern to assist in the movement.
In Ms. Ungaro's directions, I have found a new path to familiar routines and with my own students, I now use many of the powerful images that Mr. Liekens delivers throughout his voiceovers. Two of the DVDs in the collection include discussions, from which much additional information about the Pilates method can be learned.  All in all, this collection of Pilates instruction remains unsurpassed.",1074384000,29,1187,4.939698492462312
1891819,5,B00009W2LP,"I am so satisfied by Classical Pilates' work, that I decided to write this second review for the equipment DVD set. As I said for their Mat Workout Series, I am an exercise enthusiast who loves cross training: swimming, running, biking, tennis, and skiing.
I started Pilates about a year ago and it helped every other activity I enjoy. So I bought about five Pilates mat DVDs from Amazon. I started looking for an equipment DVD because I am taking lessons from a certified intructor, and we use Pilates equipment. Since I loved Classical Pilates' Mat Workout Series, I decided to give this a try. Whoa! You cannot ask for a more thorough demonstration of the entire Pilates method. The work is amazing and has so much rich material to watch that I will never ever get bored (a problem I had with some other DVDs).
As I said about the other Classical Pilates DVD, the instrucor is not just telling you what to do. He describes what you should be feeling and thinking. This is another level of depth entirely.",1068681600,27,1007,4.569060773480663
1891820,5,B00009W2LP,"I've watched a lot of fitness videos because I work at a gym that sells fitness DVDs. Granted this video would not interest everyone, but I've never seen any other video that gives 4 hours(!) of cool exercises at every level for this price.
Although I've never heard of Classical Pilates, it seems clear they carry the torch for Joseph Pilates. Watching this video actually made me want to start taking Pilates lessons. And I did! I totally love it! One of the best investments I've ever made.",1067644800,10,493,4.613636363636363
1891821,5,B00009W2LP,"This 2-DVD set features many pieces of Pilates studio equipment, and a multitude of exercises from Joseph Pilates' original New York City School. Since I am an instructor, I've sampled several DVDs for reference material. This video is by far the best. There's a wonderful a sense of pleasure when you see something very well done. There is so much wonderful material included, this video reduces your purchase effort to one-stop shopping.
What I like about Classical Pilates is that their DVDs depict the Pilates method as it ultimately should be practiced. Pilates is both a fascinating science of body mechanics, and an artful expression of flowing movement. As I watched this video, I definitely thought Pilates could be an event in the Olympics someday.
I highly recommend this video to instructors and students who are interested in the Pilates method. This 2-DVD set is also great to see for people who have no experience and who plan to study Pilates. The Pilates method can be more understandable and fascinating when you see exercises performed with intense expertise, excellent energy, and a positive mental attitude. You see what you're getting into, and anticipate the excitement of new growth and new knowledge.
I can listen to master instructor Bob Liekens regularly because his verbal cues are so on target, and so meaningfully rich in imagery. His keen observations and instruction seem to be a combination of body knowledge, movement, and descriptive poetry.",1066953600,9,1476,5.128630705394191
1891822,5,B00009W2LP,"I am writing my master's degree thesis in exercise physiology, and one of the chapters relates to Pilates. During my search for relevant research literature in the library and online, I found this unbelievably great resource for seeing almost the entire Pilates method on film. Classical Pilates is so organized and so complete you would think this 2-DVD set is a visual doctoral dissertation for a Ph. D. degree.
I found this depiction of the Pilates method to be very helpful for my graduate research project. Because it was important to compare different types of Pilates technique, I analyzed many videos and books on the method. Thank you Classical Pilates for helping me gain a better understanding of the entire method, and for assisting completion of my research project.",1064016000,8,779,5.046511627906977
1891823,5,B00009W2LP,"I've been taking Pilates lessons for a while, and my instructor enouraged me to get this video for reference and inpiration, as well as to see just how vast the Pilates method can be.
Pilates has helped me in so many ways, it would take 10 pages to write it all down.  But this 2-DVD set, in particular, totally inspired me to take my Pilates workouts to much higher levels. I also understand the principles of Pilates better. At a very reasonable price, the 4-hour video is a fantastic investment for anyone who is a student or teacher, no matter how much training you've had.
As far as I know, this Classical Pilates video is the only one that shows exercises on Pilates equipment. This video is very enjoyable to watch because the movements are so strong and graceful.",1059696000,6,771,4.546762589928058
1891824,5,B00009W2LP,In my previous review I wanted to be clear about how I am using the Pilates Method on this DVD as a rehabilitative tool with the permission of my Doctors and with certified teachers. By starting over correctly following the instructions my body is relearning how to safely move the neck and chest and regain the flexibility in my spine. One of the major lessons I have learned in Pilates is the focus my mind must bring to the work being done and putting that focus in the abdominal muscles for the core strength that builds the surrounding body. The more I rebuild core strength the more I can relax the injured muscles so they can heal. I am doing modified basic exercises from all the Classical Pilates Series to help me achieve the awareness of muscle tension and correct form. I am infinitely grateful to work with certified teachers in the original method presented in this DVD series to regain my bodies full health.,1056758400,5,923,4.6
1891825,5,B00009W2LP,"The Studio Equipment Series DVD is an impressive masterwork of pure technique, precision, expertise, perfection and accuracy in following Joseph H. Pilates original method. It is masterpiece in showing the depth and broad scope of the complete method on all the equipment Joseph H. Pilates invented.
 There is no other source of his complete method on all the equipment in visual form making this DVD ""one of a kind"". It is an ""absolute must have"" for anyone studying to become a certified teacher or anyone learning the full method.
  The insightful and thought provoking instructions and comments from Bob and Alycea stimulate and engage the mind to participate fully in each exercise making this DVD a teaching guide to be used over and over again to completely understand the proper performance of the method.
The accurate and precise visuals of the certified teachers clearly show how to perform safely and correctly the beautiful flowing rhythmic movements on all the equipment. The benefits of following this full method are obvious in the incredible stamina, flexibility and fitness of the soloists.
  As I learn these exercises I am increasing my ability to strengthen and correct posture and participate in more advanced Pilates movements and activities such as advanced dance classes. I am very grateful to have acquired these abilities by following the instruction of this equipment series along with the mat and reformer series. I am also learning how these exercises are a rehabilitative tool as I recovering from a car accident and have been told that my previous work in the Pilates Method prevented more severe damage to my spine and neck. That is another reason why I recommend the Classical Pilates Mat, Reformer and Equipment Series so strongly having been properly taught this original life altering method.
 The group of individuals on all the Classical Pilates Workout Series are dedicated to giving the purest form of the original method and clearing up the misinformation about what Pilates is and is not. There is an interesting discussion at the end of the DVD addressing some of these issues.
This DVD is an excellent masterwork that I highly recommend for all students dedicated to following the original Pilates Method or anyone who wants to learn it.",1056758400,4,2281,5.0855614973262036
1891826,5,B00009W2LP,"I did not think it was possible to beautifully and expertly film almost all of the exercises on almost all of the equipment Joseph Pilates created, then bring it together into a single product. The professionalism, vision, and breadth of scope of this Classical Pilates video is in a rarefied class of its own. This 2-DVD set is expertly organized, fascinating to watch, and includes so many exercises that it's tempting to think of Classical Pilates' Studio Equipment Series as an artful encyclopedia that every Pilates training center, instructor, student, and enthusiast should own.  Levels range from basic to super advanced.
Until now, it seems that only equipment manufacturers have filmed aspects of Joseph Pilates' equipment. For example, there are videos of some intermediate-level Cadillac exercises, or beginning-level Wunda Chair exercises, or some exercises on a single barrel. Yet no other product on the market can compare to this Classical Pilates' Studio Equipment Series.  There are a couple of reasons for this: (1) First, there are not many people remaining who truly know the full range of Joseph Pilates' original method; and (2) Pilates video producers are often NOT Pilates professionals who actually know how to teach; therefore, concern for sales precedes devotion to preserving Joseph Pilates' wonderful method.
For those of us who love and teach the Pilates method, and especially the classical forms of the Pilates method, this Studio Equipment Series is truly an accomplishment of the highest order. This project is a work of art that must have taken unending hours of creative inspiration and perseverence. I can only believe that Classical Pilates has some of the most devoted and talented group of individuals in our profession. This DVD set, and the other Classical Pilates videos, are the best.  I always recommend their videos to other instructors, as well as to my students, so that they understand how Pilates should eventually be practiced.
Keep up the great work!  I hope there is more to come from Classical Pilates.",1056067200,13,2057,5.205438066465256
1891827,5,B00009W2LP,"I purchased this 2-DVD set directly from Classical Pilates and I am thrilled that it is now available to everyone through Amazon.  It is truly a magnificent collection produced with the high standards I have come to expect from this company.  I could not stop watching it the day it arrived!  Some of the exercises, especially on the Cadillac, are certainly of the Cirque du Soleil caliber and so breathtaking to watch, but most exercises are for the beginner through intermediate and advanced, and there are modifications presented for several, like Swan on the Barrel.  It is an inspiration to see how far you can take the Pilates method and still keep it pure!  Completed by a discussion with Bob Liekens and Alycea Ungaro covering such topics as ""Which came first - the Mat or the Equipment,"" this set is not only a guide, but a tribute to the method as well.  Great work!",1055721600,4,876,4.6558441558441555

7993461,5,B00009W2LP,"I was told to get these DVD's by a Romana Certified Instructor and I'm so thankful I was. This is a good straight forward, real time DVD of all the different machines. HOWEVER. Do not be fooled-I was very dissappointed to see that the Reformer is NOT on these DVD's. Obviously that's a big omission considering how integral it is to the Pilates workout. I am assuming it was better marketing wise to include it in yet another DVD but consequently this DVD isn't really the ""Studio Equipment Series"" if it doesn't include the most important Equipment in my opinion. But that said...I HIGHLY recommend this mostly to instructors who would want a refresher on the exercieses. OR to very advanced students so that they can be more educated at their next private.",1156636800,8,758,4.706766917293233

Since I'm a fan of Pilates, one of my teachers told me about this unbelievably cool instructional documentary on Pilates. The exercises are precise, the instruction is deep, and you have almost the entire Pilates studio at your finger tips. Watching this 2-video set improves the way I practice. Now I have a library of Pilates equipment exercises in a single package.",1091836800,8,572,4.447619047619048
