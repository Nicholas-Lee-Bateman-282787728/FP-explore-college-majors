6463671,5,B00L2YXUBE,"Just in case you've forgotten what movies are in this set, the five movies are: HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, THE SIGN OF FOUR (with John Thaw of Morse fame), THE MASTER BLACKMAILER, THE LAST VAMPYRE, and THE ELIGIBLE BACHELOR. All of these great movies are upgraded into blu-ray and truly beautiful - both sound and visual - on a large screen. These are much better than the DVD set which I had owned and sold in order to get this set. Jeremy Brett is at his best in these movies and Edward Hardwicke does a seamless job of taking over as Watson from David Burke who is in the first season, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The only drawback is that they are in 1:33:1 format or old TV size, so you will not get widescreen but have to settle for the black sidebars. However, you get so engrossed in the mystery that even that is not a distraction. BBC has done a wonderful job with these, both the movies and the TV series, and I think you will find these worth upgrading your collection.",1412553600,35,984,4.353260869565218

8663467,4,B00L2YXUBE,"Short verdict: if you don't have the complete Blu-Ray set of Granada's Sherlock Holmes series, purchase this set for ""The Sign of Four,"" the closest anyone has come to transferring the spirit and letter of Doyle's stories to feature film. It stars perhaps the best Holmes and Watson to ever appear onscreen, Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke. ""The Sign of Four"" is a very close adaptation of Conan Doyle's novel but that would count for nothing if it wasn't stylishly directed, sumptuously produced, and perfectly acted.
The other films are a mixed bag. ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" suffers from a low budget and unimaginative direction, but ""The Master Blackmailer"" is a sumptuous and imaginative expansion of Conan Doyle's short story ""Charles Augustus Milverton."" The last two films, ""The Last Vampyre"" and ""The Eligible Bachelor,"" also expand on short stories but throw out too much Doyle; they collapse into pseudo-gothic melodrama and star a very unwell Jeremy Brett.
The visual quality of the Blu-Rays is leaps and bounds ahead of the old DVDs, but there are no extras! Why couldn't they have included the deleted scene from ""The Master Blackmailer"" (Lestrade's second appearance in the film) or one of the many TV interviews with Brett and/or Hardwicke?

Now, on to the longer verdict...
01. ""The Sign of Four"" (1987) was also made at the right time, when the Granada Sherlock Holmes TV series had proven a success and received the go-ahead and financial backing to temporarily expand its format. It was filmed in 35mm with a lavish (for TV) budget and presents a convincing vision of Holmes's world, from the cluttered Victorian furnishings to a steam launch chase down the Thames. Jeremy Brett was at the peak of his powers, before manic depression and heart failure permanently wrecked his health. His mercurial Holmes lives only for detection--without a case he's twitchy and irritable; on the trail he's suave and scintillating. Opposite him, Hardwicke's Watson is grizzled paragon of common sense and decency. The other players (Jenny Seagrove, John Thaw, Ronald Lacey) are a perfectly cast assortment of eccentrics.

Director Peter Hammond is over-fond of compositions involving mirrors, but he keeps the eye (and the actors) occupied. At its best the film is a catalogue of quintessential Sherlockiana: London fog, hidden treasure, the Baker Street Irregulars, and Holmes's outlandish disguises, violin playing, and elaborate deductions. The plot is classically Holmesian, involving Imperial misdeeds coming home to haunt their perpetrators. Some have criticized the film for the lengthy flashback near the end, but this is the emotional heart of the film, the why-done-it that comes after the criminal's apprehension and gives a tragic coloring to his crimes. It gives the literal Sign of Four an ethical resonance.
The film has been remastered and released on Blu-Ray. It looks excellent but whoever handled the color correction eliminated the day-for-night effects, so the boat chase and the Indian scenes are much brighter then they should be.

02. ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1988) should have been the best version of the novel ever made. Instead it was a sad disappointment. The  series had overspent on earlier episodes and to save money decided to shoot a two hour film instead of two one-hour entries. The tightened budget meant no 17th century flashback to Sir Hugo Baskerville's demise, no London street chase, no filming in Dartmouth, and no outdoors filming at night. No version of the Hound can succeed with none of these elements.

By the time of filming Jeremy Brett was afflicted by ill mental and physical health. His opening scenes are crisply performed, but his later scenes have less electricity. Fortunately Edward Hardwickes Watson remained unparalleled at suggesting an inner life for the character and showing his competence and humanity. Kristoffer Tabori plays an appealing Sir Henry Baskerville (he looks and sounds like Robbie Robertson) but doesnt fit the character's strapping westerner image.
Like all the entries in Granadas Holmes series, this Hound has convincing period detail. This was achieved despite the reduced budget. Location shooting was in Yorkshire instead of Dartmoor; whats onscreen is a reasonable substitute for the moors, but the climactic scenes were all filmed indoors on a set with a fog machine (like every damn production except the Russian one). The set looks smaller and crummier than anything from any of the other versions, and barely has a nighttime feel. The direction, staging, and editing in these scenes is clumsy and sometimes incoherent. Unforgivably, the hound is repeatedly shown before the climax and what we see is nothing more than a glowing Great Dane (aside from a fake head that attacks Sir Henry in close-up).

Away from the moor, the editing and direction are competent but terribly slow and plodding. It takes forever for characters to get on and off trains, move through Baskerville Hall, or enter and exit carriages. The lethargic pacing kills the thrills and the unimaginative direction throws away all the great, dramatic moments of the storythe death of Sir Charles, the man on the tor, Holmess reappearance, the unveiling of the Hound, etc. The script, by T.R. Bowen, proficiently compresses and retains much of the original. It shows that the novel's structure works on film, or at least would in a film with greater atmosphere and mood. Granada's Hound is not truly bad--it just looks mediocre in light of the series's track record.

03. ""The Master Blackmailer"" (1992) and the two remaining films stem from Granada's decision to stop making one-hour Holmes episodes and move into two-hour productions. This was an attempt to compete with Inspector Morse, but the Holmes saga only had two novels left to adapt: A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear. The first involved a young Holmes and Watson meeting for the first time, and included a lengthy flashback to Mormons in Utah, so it wasn't usable. The Valley of Fear was considered and rejected, but it also had a lengthy flashback that didn't involve Holmes. In retrospect this was a mistake, considering that much of the screentime of the films that were made didn't feature Holmes anyway.

The Master Blackmailer is an expansion of Doyle's ""Charles Augustus Milverton,"" an unusual short story that involves little detection; instead, Holmes and Watson turn burglar to thwart a blackmailer. Luckily adapter Jeremy Paul was able to build upon references to the blackmailers victims, creating a story about how Holmes learns of the villain, which leads into Doyles original tale. Slick direction and a good budget result in an opulent production of operatic melodrama. Controversially, the film visualizes Doyles reference to Holmes disguising himself as a plumber to romance the blackmailers housemaid and gain information. The film makes a mistake and portrays Holmes as genuinely touched by this experience, whereas Doyle made it clear how cold-blooded Holmes was. The script cleverly builds up the identity of Milvertons greatest antagonist, and those who haven't read the original will receive a fine surprise at the end. Pauls additions add context to the story, but they don't  justify the extended running time; they could be efficiently abbreviated to fit into the old one hour format. This lesson was lost on Granada and it ordered two more features.

04. ""The Last Vampyre"" (1993) was Jeremy Paul's expansion of another short story, ""The Sussex Vampire,"" but proved far less successful. In Doyles original Holmes is called into a small town to investigate what looks like a case of vampirism. Using his deductive powers, he reveals the true answer as being rooted in a family drama. ""The Last Vampyre"" disposes of the tight structure of the short story in order to flirt with the supernatural and its effect on an entire community. Holmes is called in (for the flimsiest reasons) to investigate a mysterious stranger named Stockton, who has recently moved into a village and seems to be causing bad luck. Holmes does very little deduction to resolve the crisis; indeed, he does very little of anything and proves useless in preventing the series of tragedies that overtake this morbid, unsatisfying mess of a film. Nothing worksthe villagers are too one-dimensional for us to care about, Stockton is too pathetic to be a villain, the villains motivations are vague, and the weak mystery about vampirism is weakly explained. A fine short story has been bloated with padding that overwhelms the original.

05. ""The Eligible Bachelor"" is an expansion of Doyles ""The Noble Bachelor."" Even Doyle didn't think highly of this story, which would have needed padding to fit single hour, let alone two. The adapter, T.R. Bowen, retains more of the original story than in the previous film, but Doyles plot is now a subplot, edged out of the spotlight by a Gothic, mock-operatic version of the Bluebeard story and an even more ludicrous subplot about a depressed Holmes having precognitive prophetic dreams. Such psychic malarkey has nothing to with Sherlock Holmes. Even during his spiritualist period Conan Doyle never burdened Holmes with such silliness.

Peter Hammond returns to direct, but without a good story his style seems empty. There is too much backstory and not enough detective work and reasoning. In a classic Sherlock Holmes story, the detective is presented with a strange mystery. He then calls attention to several odd details that seem to have nothing to do with the case. At the end he catches the culprit, reveals the plot, and explains the brilliant deductions that allowed him to connect the odd details to the criminals hidden scheme. The problem with the ""Master Blackmailer,"" ""Last Vampyre,"" and ""Eligible Bachelor"" is that they replace this structure with an unsatisfactory hodgepodge of events. We see the mystery unfold through crosscuts between mysterious scenes--this destroys suspense and renders Holmess brilliant leaps of deduction and dramatic revelations almost superfluous.

In the last two films Jeremy Brett's already ill heath takes a drastic turn for the wors. The drugs prescribed to battle his manic-depression damaged his heart and caused him to retain water, making him look bloated. He was also short on breath, and without vocal control his performances became shouty and flamboyant. And yet Brett had so fully merged himself with Sherlock Holmes (or vice versa?) that he seemed to capture what an ailing, aging, bipolar Holmes might have been like, if Doyle had let the character experience the ravages of ill mental and physical health.

The most damning thing one can say about the last three films is that all of them would have made much better one-hour stories. Granadas short-sighted decision to make these features instead of six hour-long episodes deprived us of three adaptations of the short stories. Fortunately Granada realized its folly and went back to one-hour shows in ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,"" Bretts last bow.",1523318400,,11049,5.161920714684534

8663473,4,B00L2YXUBE,"Sherlock Holmes Feature Film Collection, Brett

This set contains five movies from the series that featured Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. John H. Watson. You can compare them to the The Hound of the Baskervilles with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, and The Sign of Four with Matt Frewer.  This version of The Hound is the most accurate as it did not edit out the typewriter. The Sign seems about equal. Three of these films have changed the name from the original; there were changes in the story. I think the original stories were better.

1: The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1988. This is the most accurate adaption of the story and as good as any earlier version.
2: The Last Vampire, 1992. This was extensively modified from The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire and is not as good.
3: The Sign of Four, 1987. It is as good as any previous adaptation of the story.
4: The Eligible Bachelor, 1992. This adaptation distorts The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor and makes it confusing.
5: The Master Blackmailer, 1991. This is an enlarged version of Charles Augustus Milverton that reflects the concerns of its authors.

I would have preferred to see all four of the long stories in one collection. Missing are A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear. Both were made into movies in the 1930's.",1509148800,2,1321,4.632478632478633

8663475,1,B00L2YXUBE,"I have to disagree with the value of buying only 1 DVD for $30 when you can buy ALL 12 DVDs...the COMPLETE SERIES...for under $90 in blu-ray!
I have had the complete TV series since it first came out (not in blu-ray though) and I have no complaints about the set. It comes with a booklet on the series and is well worth the investment...especially for those who are into the new blu-ray players since the cost is just a little more than the standard DVD set was.
The stories and the acting are what made the series so highly rated and enjoyed long before blu-ray. I also have the complete works of Sherlock Holmes in both hard copy books and on my Kindle as well, having been an avid fan of Sherlock and Watson for more than 40 years. This series is far better than the current ""Sherlock"" BBC series and buying only one DVD at such an exorbitant price doesn't seem logical to me.
Don't you agree Watson?",1458345600,8,903,4.317647058823529
