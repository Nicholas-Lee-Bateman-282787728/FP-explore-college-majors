8328521,1,B001NZF1KU,"I suggest not to purchase. Its only function is to capatilize on the UFO phenomonom and the worst attemt at it Ive ever seen. I mean the worst, I have ever seen. I don't leave reviews but in this case I feel obligated to the people that put their time and effort into something they are passionate about. There are even some that are good at entertaining,but they  too put their effort and concern about the quality of the product they are trying to sell. This takes the cake for garbage. I would be embarassed to sell this on Amazon or anywhere. Don't buy it that's my suggestion.",1255132800,2,581,4.37962962962963
