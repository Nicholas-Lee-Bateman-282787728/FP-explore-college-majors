7821143,1,6302038626,"I could not hear most of it.  There were large places where it looked like the VHS tape wasn't feeding through.  When I took out the tape, though, it was running ""as it should"".  When the places occurred, the voices weren't understandable.  Is there any way I can get a replacement?  At the same price, of course.",1453507200,,313,4.421052631578948
7821144,5,6302038626,"The chance to own this tape of Sammy and Jerry on the stage together was a no brainer. Two performers with over 100 years
of combined time on stage,with their beginnings going all the way back to the vaudville days. Both men singing and dancing
together and also doing their solo acts. Jerry doing his cane act which he also did in Damn Yankees,just terrific. Sammy doing
a terrific moonwalk and short rendition of Micheal Jackson's Bad. It's a chance to see an act by two legends on one stage
which is truly priceless and timeless.",1356825600,,532,4.552083333333333

7821146,5,6302038626,"This is the show of these two legends Sammy Davis Jr. and Jerry Lewis I was going to see, and missed the opportunity of a life time. I was so thrilled to find it, if only on VHS, at least I now have it. This is an unforgettable performance that can never be recreated by anyone in show business today! They sang, acted, danced, told funny stories, they did it all. I am so greatful to have a copy.  Jerry",1331683200,,404,4.05
7821147,5,6302038626,"I love my VHS but if something happened to my VHS I would gladly buy it again.  Please I wish it was on DVD.  One day I can copy it to DVD disc.

Jerry Lewis And Sammy are wonderful. There comeraudity together is  the best.",1160006400,,223,3.888888888888889
7821148,5,6302038626,"This is a great video and the comedy even 15 yrs after it's filming is still current and funny.
Sammy is the slightly greater talent of the two cause he can be funny, dance and plus on top of that he can sing seriously too.  The chemistry between the two is fantastic and the ending is one of the highlights..I won't spoil by sharing all the details.
Sammy doing Mr. Bojangles is indeed very moving and I think it was also the song that was played at his funeral.  It was SAMMY'S SONG!
Also, Sammy's impersonation of Michael Jackson is FUNNY as heck.
The video is barely an hour long but full of fun and good music.  I'd imagine it's edited from the original or multiple shows.
But overall u get two legends of show business.....this should be out on DVD.
Nonetheless, the STEREO sound and picture are very good.",1072828800,6,812,4.4
7821149,5,6302038626,"This is a grand night of music and comedy, Jerry is at his best, and Sammy is superb.  You have to see Jerry's ""cane routine"" it is Jerry comedy at its best.  Sammy's ""Mr. Bo Jangles"" will remain in your  heart forever.  A mix of comedy and song that will stay with you for a  lifetime, the timing, and your feeling of being in on the act is as fresh  as their first time together.  What a wonderful gift to leave the lovers of  these two consumate performers.  I wish everyone had this moment in comedy  and song history, we are so lucky to have discovered such talent, and let  it blossom through the years.",926812800,13,609,4.208695652173913
