5931011,1,B00EOMJ9O8,"Thanks to Irene King for revealing that the DVD will not play in her region.
I was so excited when I received the email from Amazon that Season 6 was available,
however after reading comments, no region was revealed.  Therefore, I will not order
this much awaited DVD as apparently it will not play in the United States.
Try again Amazon, Please give us Region 1 to purchase,  Thanks",1382918400,48,383,4.536231884057971

I watched the first 3 seasons on prime and then ordered season 4 dvd. was great. Then I ordered a season 5 which was confusing because it seemed some episodes were missing, by the end I realized it was actually season 6 so now this season 6 that I ordered I have already seen and wondering how I can actually find the real season 5.

5931046,3,B00EOMJ9O8,"Heartland is a wonderful series and we are addicted to it.  The problem with this particular set is the this Sixth Season is exactly the same as the Fifth Season.  It also comes in a foreign language, so maybe that country is a season behind us.  Anyway, we didn't open it and watch it right after we ordered it because we watch one episode each day after breakfast, and we had the 5th season to watch first and didn't get to the 6th season until this morning.  And then, lo and behold, it is the same as the 5th.  So be very careful when you order the 6th Season that it isn't a repeat of the 5th.  Now we are not only disappointed, but can't afford to order the real 6th season at this time.",1461628800,,693,4.0962962962962965

Wholesome values, family life, and at the end of each episode everyone comes together and at least a couple people have learned a lesson.  It's not all sunshine and roses, but they care about each other and I love that about the show.

5931300,5,B00EOMJ9O8,"Love Heartland.  The only downside is that it is a show made in Canada and we have to wait a little longer to view the show in the US.  I love the Amy Fleming character.  She has such a love for animals in general, but we see how well she works with horses.  It has been fun to see the character develop over the years, watching Amy learn how to relate to people as well as she does horses.  There are too few good family dramas on TV nowadays, so it is great to see this show continue.",1412726400,,486,3.9183673469387754

I discovered it long after it was originated and did a marathon of watching it from Season one through Season five on Netflix.  Then I ordered the sixth season on Amazon and blitzed through that as well.  Now I am pawing the ground until Season 7 is released.  I love love love it!  Don't think twice if you are wondering if buying the DVD's is better than waiting until season 6 comes out on Netflix.  Do it!!  How could you wait so long if you did not??!!,1410825600,,544,4.173076923076923

I have watched this show from the first episode to the last and I feel like I know these characters.  What a great TV show! It is out of Canada and I noticed that they say herbs with the h sound and the way they say sorry is a little different than we say it here in the U.S.  This is a show that you could be proud to watch with your whole family as it is very clean.  The characters deal with some hard life lessons.  I highly recommend this show.  There is also a Christmas time movie called Heartland Christmas that is really good.  The main character, Amy, is a horse whisperer.  This would be a great gift for any girl who likes a story about a girl and her horse.",1409270400,,824,3.9096385542168677

I recently watch seasons 1-4 on Spirit Clips and season 5 on Netflix.  Then I bought the season 6 DVD set from Amazon.  I have never before collected a series DVD set, but I intend to collect the entire Heartland series.  Great actors, down to earth, great plots and characters!  And the writers always know how to leave us wanting more.  As a beginning fiction writer myself, I am into clean stories so appreciate Heartland very much.

Good wholesome t.v., something akin to the waltons, whereby you meet the cast young and watch them grow up.....6 seasons is a long run, must be something to it and they are making season 7!  I got hooked on this show, and though I am no angel, I love not being exposed to profanity, sex on screen, killing and shooting etc... each evening.  Life is stressful enough.  I highly recommend this as it is a refreshing change for most and takes those familiar with the waltons back to the good ole days of family and shows the true meaning of that word.  Family that is not dysfunctional? what is that? LOL, well this show will show you.  Yes the show has it's share of life ""issues"" but they drive home the saying of:  I love you, I just don't like what you are ""doing"".  good stuff, watch it! see for yourself.",1407024000,,921,4.308139534883721

5931409,5,B00EOMJ9O8,"Heartland has to be one of the best episodic dramas ever to hit television. The series is filmed entirely on location in the Canadian Rocky Mountains near Calgary, Alberta Canada. The rugged countryside, with the mountains serving as an awe-inspiring backdrop is as real as it gets. Most series that I have seen are set in perpetual summer; not Heartland. The seasons pass, Spring, Summer. Fall, and Winter, giving Heartland added realism. Amber Marshall, as Amy Fleming comes across as a real horsewoman and horse whisperer. The other cast members are likewise well-cast. I have watched all 100 episodes of this show available to U.S. residents, including the sixth season DVD set and heartily recommend the series. My only quibble is that the special features on the DVD are not closed captioned for the hearing-impaired.",1406073600,,823,5.103703703703704

It's real life and shows the love and care of all animals and people as well as the abuse and bickering. The hardships of owning a ranch and the choices made. It's not only about Amber, all the others breathe life into the episodes.
Jack is the heart and soul of the show. I was so concerned about his role that I had to get a sneak preview to make sure he didn't die from the end of the season 6. When is the season 7 coming out. Can't wait!

5931618,5,B00EOMJ9O8,Love this whole series.....wholesome ....great acting.....fascinated by the horses and all the beauty that surrounds Heartland!!!! Families can watch this together and learn how to understand how normal families operate and solve things,1385424000,54,236,6.181818181818182
5931619,5,B00EOMJ9O8,"I loved it, but the season finale was TORTURE! I need to know what happens next! Why would you end a season like that! WHY!!!",1385424000,3,125,4.04
5931620,5,B00EOMJ9O8,This is the best TV series for family watching that in my opinion has ever been produced.  The only problem with it is that we view the entire season in few days and we have to wait another year to purchase the next season. Thank you Canada for having the morals that were at one time depicted in the movies that were produced here in the USA instead of the garbage that comes out of Hollywood today.  The Heartland series is one that a family with younger members can enjoy together without the fear of embarrassment of the parents.  But then I know that I am old fashioned.  Buy all the seasons and enjoy them over and over again like we do.,1385424000,161,643,4.245901639344262

5931624,5,B00EOMJ9O8,"This is the best television series on television and I hope it last at least another 10 years.  It is really sad that we have to wait a year for these DVD's to be released.  What happened to the good family television series of the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's.  Has America lost that much in it's morals that we no longer have family television series, all these stupid reality shows that are anything but reality.",1385164800,4,412,4.394736842105263

The scenery is breathtaking and the cast are well fitted to the characters they portray.  I appreciate that is depicts personal life trials and triumphs and integrates good old fashioned family values. I truly admire the cast and all they did to set a standard in quality entertainment.

I am not an avid tv watcher so I found the first four seasons on netflix. I was hooked! I can't wait until they put the seventh season on DVD.  I am sorry the show was cancelled.  It seems the ones of value always are these days.  This show made me feel good at a time I needed it most.  I want to thank the creators and cast for an amazing experience.  May God bless each one in their future endeavors.",1384646400,8,790,4.248322147651007
