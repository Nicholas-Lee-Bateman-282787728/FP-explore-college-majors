4894491,5,B005UPYZOC,So interesting for the whole family to watch. A great way to visit the Smithsonian from home if not able to visit in person.,1405468800,7,124,4.208333333333333
4894492,5,B005UPYZOC,Smithsonian Network programs are great and so informative. I purchased DVDs and then found the channel with more episodes and programming so very happy with all Smithsonian stories. THANKS,1392854400,6,188,5.517241379310345
4894493,5,B005UPYZOC,"This set of videos is absolutely wonderful! It is entertaining and informative. Tom Cavanaugh was the perfect pick to give you a fun guided tour of the collections of the Smithsonian! My family and I set down and watch several episodes at a time. We have learned more about the collections and how they came to be than we ever thought possible.

If you are like me and don't know if you will ever get to see the actual Smithsonian or are just wanting to wet your appetite for what you will see, you will love this collection!",1370044800,9,525,4.357142857142857
8487052,5,B005UPYZOC,"I read reviews on this saying Tom was too humor oriented and ruined the show. That's not true for me. If you know anything about Mr. Cavanaugh it's that he has a genuine interest in the subjects he covers and adds his own spice and laugh out loud moments while at the same time taking his job seriously and dishes out the kind of knowledge us historians want to hear. He even has the curators giggling and it's light hearded and just wonderful. I highly recommend this series to any history buff. 5 out of 5 stars, love it.",1505001600,,523,4.292929292929293

8487056,1,B005UPYZOC,Would have sent it back if I could.  The video is fine but so liberal.  Wish they would have stuck to facts without throwing in what folks think on things.  So much to cover at the Smithsonian and yet they spend so much time going other places or checking into things that don't even deal with items on view at the museum.  I would pass on this and watch it on line first save your money.,1484438400,3,388,4.065789473684211

8487058,5,B005UPYZOC,Super fun show!! There's a little something for everyone in this show; the Smithsonian's collection is impressively diverse. The host's goofy humor makes transitions and awkward/slow moments fun.,1471046400,4,195,6.0
8487059,5,B005UPYZOC,Interesting and witty.  I have enjoyed every episode.  My grand children have too.,1433116800,4,82,5.230769230769231

8487061,4,B005UPYZOC,I loved this actor when he was on Scrubs as Zach Braffs older brother.  I love History so being able to go inside the Smithsonian and see what they have in the archives and not on display and hearing the stories of how the objects came to be at the museum is so interesting.  I have to find out if there are more videos in the series - if there are I am getting them.,1406505600,8,367,3.88
