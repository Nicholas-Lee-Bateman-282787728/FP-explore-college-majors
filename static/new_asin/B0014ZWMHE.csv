3136531,1,B0014ZWMHE,"This dvd has no depth. It lacks expert commentary. There are nowhere in this film an authority on the subject of spirituality, metaphysics, and science as editorial claims; there was Mr Shankar but he didn't say much and you can't hear him. There are parts of this film where a camcorder was used to get the testimonials of children;  The contents were poorly put together, and desktop pc graphics to fill in the rest. This is not worth the money.",1224979200,7,447,4.5875
3136532,3,B0014ZWMHE,"this dvd is 3 hours long, but broken into 2 parts (1.5 hours each) this video talks about MANY different things and will have to be watched a few times with like-minded friends to grasp some parts. a few parts did not make any sense to me (measuring the potential of water... potential to do what? how is this being measured?) and seemed to lack information. but maybe after i watch this again with my friend, we will be able to bounce ideas off of eachother and gain a better understanding. overall i am glad i bought it. its packed with interesting info,  but its not as high quality a video (with visuals) as ""The Secret"" or ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" or ""Spirit Space"". hopefully i will grasp more of the information in this the next time around!",1219622400,11,752,4.371428571428571
3136533,5,B0014ZWMHE,"The Voice is a long awaited DVD that includes interviews on consciousness, enlightenment, what happens after death, how we reach mystical states of awareness and so much more.  Never before have I seen such a diversity of experts including scientists, mystics, representatives from various religions, lay people, etc. all coming together to present their many faceted answers to some of life's deepest questions.  If you are a spiritual seeker, or a person seeking to blend science and spirituality, this DVD will assist you on your journey, give you so much more to explore, and help validate the stirrings in your own heart and  mind.  A fantastic film for anyone seeking to expand their understanding of human consciousness.  And while you're at it, check out their cool website too...[...]

8256765,1,B0014ZWMHE,"The makers of this film try to convince us that they are using science to prove the things that they believe to be true, but they use tiny shreds of scientific fact and mix it up with a lot of hooey. For example it is proven that we emanate energy. Then they show that they are detecting auras and chakras using ""scientific"" techniques. If you research their techniques you'll find that they are not valid. For example they show Kirlian images of auras. This technique will give the same result from a chunk of metal or anything conductive.

They quote the ""gospel"" of Phiilip throughout. This ""gospel "" is from one of the scrolls found near Nag Hammadi in Egypt, not from the bible. The writings are important, because they give insight into the Gnostics and the time in general. Let's not, however, try to imply that they are considered part of the bible by calling them the gospels. They were written some time between 150 AD and 350 AD and definitely not by Phillip since he couldn't have been alive then.

Also sad is that one of the 5 star reviews is by one of the people in the film. Hmmm.",1468713600,,1096,4.420792079207921
8256766,2,B0014ZWMHE,"A badly produced DVD, regardless of subject.  The fact that it just barely skims the surface of the connection between ancient mysticism and modern physics with a few quotations from primary source references is the only reason I gave two stars.  Addressing that connection was so poorly organized and disjointed that it became tedious trying to follow, and I eventually started to laugh out loud at how bad it was.  The folks invited from various disciplines to provide commentary were either religious practitioners, artists, psychics or psychologists/MDs, and only some of them acknowledged as experts.  There were no actual particle physicists to offer any new ideas or insights on the revolution in scientific understanding that seems to sound more and more mystical every day (and suppressed by corporate media), although some were quoted occasionally. There did not seem to be any recognizable flow from one idea to the next to build any sort of increasing awareness of the subject, and I could find not one instance of the term ""The Voice"" used anywhere in a way to give some credence to the choice of title.  Production failed totally when English subtitles were not provided for persons with very heavy accents, rendering their contribution unintelligible, and the amount of time spent on the difficulties and rewards of meditation was excessive.  A portion was provided with testimonials from two children and their mother (no qualifications listed).  The producers should have had enough common sense to know that children are utterly unqualified to speak on any subject, because they are, well, CHILDREN!  At this early point in the presentation, credibility went out the window, but I decided to stick it out, and continued to experience disappointment.  Some of the graphics were beautiful, supposedly symbolizing deep mysticism, but many just seemed to be ordinary, stock photo filler, unrelated to what was being presented at the moment.  It seemed like someone went shopping for graphics and then randomly inserted them.  Lastly, and I suppose this was intentional to gain a wider audience of dupes who would buy it, this DVD evolved into a decidedly Christian slant toward the end.  Mr. Sereda speaks for an uncomfortably long time about his Samadhi experience of ""angels"" and different levels of ""heaven"" while doing Buddhist meditation.  My impression was that he was attempting to enhance his status as some kind of neo-Christian mystic, but he seems to have difficulty distinguishing mythology and subjective experience from facts (alas, so typical of the overly-religious) in his commentary.  The wrap-up seemed focused on the ""heaven"" descriptions of Near Death Experiencers, rolled into a bit of religious (again mostly mostly Christian) concepts of ""god.""  There is a growing list of informative books on the connection between the quantum physics revolution and ancient mysticism, but very few DVDs.  If you feel the need to start with a DVD before jumping into the books, a good place is ""What the *Bleep* Do We Know?"".  ""The Voice"", is not a place to start or even spend any time on at all, unless you really love meditating and you really love Jesus.",1410825600,,3181,5.145631067961165
8256767,4,B0014ZWMHE,"Having had numerous spiritual/consciousness experiences in my life time I have known that there was/is a greater consciousness for several decades now.  I've heard/felt/sensed it, and I've spoken of it.  It's as real as YOU are.  This is a very interesting documentary and I find it to be a type of vindication for what I've been telling people for a loooooong time.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't know if the science involved is true and accurate, but I do know that the subject matter (greater consciousness) is.  If you have an open mind, get this documentary!",1394582400,,567,4.686868686868687
8256768,4,B0014ZWMHE,"This video is a bit long (3 hours), but is broken up into two parts for easier digestion.  I have been doing healing work for the last 8 years or so but have a strong leaning to scientific explanations of the experiences that I and my clients have.  At least a general idea of it since, in the broad view, no one really knows for certain. Everything we know is based on our own perceptions and experiences and since every person has a unique combination of the 2.... then obviously its all subjective.

Having said that I liked this film a great deal. The speakers are passionate and very descriptive about what their experiences mean to them. The science that is displayed deals with near death experiences, the different levels of the GOD kingdom, Auras, different religions and dietys, energy, relationships between plants and people, sound/music, and various aspects of the universe, and how it all is intertwined. This is great subject matter for anyone studying any of topics listed above.

I think this film is a good broad representation of how everything overlaps in life and is entertaining enough to keep you interested in watching it until the end.  A good addition to any any holistic library.",1253318400,3,1206,4.778846153846154

8256770,2,B0014ZWMHE,"Title says most of it, not to say that the people interviewed are so blatantly, Marxist, but the creator and narrator are embarrassingly Marxist almost Communist and he keeps pushing this crap as if its real.  I have to admit that some of the responses are interesting to listen too.",1236729600,6,283,4.66
8256771,5,B0014ZWMHE,"This is an in depth spiritual documentary and a real feast of spiritual and metaphysical concepts. It is Directed by David Sereda, film maker, author and environmentalist. Scholar Robert Thurman expounds on the mystical Kingdom of Shambala. Impeccable footage of spiritual images are here including many special effects. David articulates the stages of meditation and describes his own enlightening meditation in which he perceived the sound of our Sun. This sound was also described in the Vedas, and even verified by NASA. The viewer can hear the ""Sound of the Sun"" courtesy of NASA! So many topics are covered, such as astrophysics, conciousness studies, science, quantum physics, the insights of Pythagoras, and what spooked Einstein. Therefore the film (Parts I & II) runs a full three hours and i suggest viewing it in separate segments of 30 or 45 minutes each for easier absorbtion.",1235433600,8,890,5.1875
8256772,3,B0014ZWMHE,Good video with a lot of information. The transcition between the topics is not very smooth. It is more like a spirtual tale of a lone ranger.,1229212800,4,142,4.296296296296297
8256773,1,B0014ZWMHE,"If this isn't a defective DVD, then absolutely not worth the money.  NO visuals at all, just a blank screen with the producer's name on it and a picture of a sun.  The audio was good, but no introductions and no visuals or labels, so impossible to know who was talking.  Confusing.  I've seen much better DVDs on these subjects.",1226620800,2,328,4.416666666666667
8256774,5,B0014ZWMHE,"One of the best from David Sereda. Lots of scientific facts and spiritual beliefs all rolled into the life we live. The Voice shows that we can make a difference in the fear laden world we live in. Your point of view does count, cause we all create the reality we live in! The time to change your perspective is now.",1225584000,2,316,4.19672131147541
