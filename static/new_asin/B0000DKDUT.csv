1925665,1,B0000DKDUT,"Why do I get the feeling that Shade 123 is a flack for Sony Pictures? You don't see too many people who put exclamation points in their reviews--when you see them in newspaper blurbs, they've usually been added there by the publicity department even though they weren't present in the original review. It's done to make it sound like the reviewer thinks that this is THE greatest film ever put on God's green earth. It's also a ploy generally reserved for stinkers to stave off the unmistakable scent of flop sweat. And ladies and gentlemen, flop sweat is coming off of this thing like river torrents. It's a King Kong-sized load. This is yet another attempt to blend cool, hip-gangster-type indie flicks with more mainstream film and you know how often that works (NEVER).
One reason it's inherently flawed is the presence of Jen and Ben. Look, it's difficult enough to suspend belief in half the product Hollywood puts out due to the fact that you've seen the same people a dozen times previous. But when the movie in question features an off-screen couple that's on the verge of having a 24-news channel devoted exclusively to their every move, it's even worse. Not once, ever, during this film was I ever able to connect with the characters. I was never able to think I was watching anything except two huge red-carpet/tabloid stars. (to be fair, the film was made before they became a couple offscreen)
I wish I could say they do the best with what they're given, but the plot is so DOA, cobbled as it is from a half-dozen cop comedies, that nobody can do anything with it. This is one of those films where you're just waiting for it to prove itself to you, to give you a reason for being. And you'll wait and wait and wait and wait...
Let's sum it up: too talky, too many ridiculous plot contrivances, too many people acting []to support the ridiculous plot contrivances, (""Idiot Plot"" Roger Ebert) there's no suspense, no action, no humor and no romance. It's dull, dull, dull. This is Martin Brest's second worst movie, right after Meet Joe Black. Really really bad.

1925702,5,B0000DKDUT,"Anybody who says this is a bad movie is an ignorant troglodyte.  Ben Affleck channels Paul Scheer at his best (think Piranha 3D meets Good Will Hunting) in an acting tour de force.  Not since June Diane Rafael's epic ""Human Giant"" role as Dick Face Fairy has an actress captivated me as much as J-Lo did in this masterpiece.  Justin Bartha must have gone to the Jason Mantzoukas School of Portraying Mental Disabilities for SEVERAL years before taking on this monumental depiction of a rap-loving simpleton (he ALMOST nailed it...but you're still the king, Mantzoukas).  Many people may ask ""How did this get made?""  Well I will tell you, my friend......it was made by angels. Angels from Heaven.",1314662400,6,696,4.864406779661017
1925703,3,B0000DKDUT,"The problem with this movie is the writing. After watching it. I was more impressed that J-lo, Affleck, Pacino and Walken were actually able to get into their roles. Especially given the lame-ass script they were given. Some of the scenes like the cow bull scene and the All powerful Vagina scene was some of the worst dialog I have ever heard. It made me laugh. I'm sure it made them roll their eyes also. One of the most unbelievable parts of this story is accepting that Affleck and J-lo are hard-ass thugs. Neither of them have that quality about them. At no point do we get to see them rough anyone up. So you are supposed to accept without proof that they can ""Get the job done"". It's Not plausible. The many examples of story issues are the single scene performances of Walken as the Detective, and Melissa Lahlitah Crider as J-lo's lover. They could be deleted and not effect the story. None of the characters were developed except the 3 main characters. And if Rain Man and Forrest Gump never existed I am sure we would be praising Justin Bartha's performance of Brian. He was a very likable character and had some lines that just made me laugh.

I do not fault these actors for taking the money and running.

So, Is this the worst movie ever made? Not in a long shot. It had a ton of star power and was held up to a higher standard than say, something like ""Bio Dome"" or ""From Justin to Kelly""

I was able to watch ""Gigli"" in full.
I was unable to finish ""Bio dome"" or ""From Justin to Kelly"" and a part of me died for trying.",1299628800,2,1535,4.304498269896194
1925704,5,B0000DKDUT,"Everyone who is rating this movie badly obviously has no idea what Gigli is truly about. I'm a big fan of rom-com, and I have yet to see any other like Gigli. What people don't seem to realize is that the movie is actually supposed to be a dark romantic comedy. And on this level it is actually quite amazing. This movie has everything.... romance, comedy, mobster, lesbians, and who can deny the joys of watching Jennifer Lopez for an hour and a half. It actually has way more depth then a lot of the other romantic comedies they're putting out nowadays. This movie had a lot of balls to make a movie about the mafia, romance, comedy and the mentally handicapped all at once.

While the movie has one of the most unique premises of any romantic comedy (or ANY move for that matter), the real magic is the characters. When Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez recorded this movie together, when they were better known as Beniffer, they were in an actual real life relationship, which translates awesomely to the chemistry of the two charecters on the big silver screen. And who better to pick for a mafia boss than Al Pacino?! He plays his part perfectly, and the great cast kept me laughing, crying, or on the edge of my seat throughout the film.

IF you are a fan of Rom-Coms, Ben Affleck, J-Lo, or you just like interesting genre mash-ups in general, you can't help but have this one missing from your DVD collection. If only all romantic comedies were as bold as this one. If you gave this film less than 4-stars you obviously don't understand what Gigli was going for, because it is way beyond any typical run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. For those of you who are looking for a unique and different film that will make you think, look know further, GET YOUR COPY OF GIGLI TODAY!!!!",1299542400,3,1779,4.521739130434782
1925705,1,B0000DKDUT,"I watched this movie recently because I had heard how bad it was and I wanted to see for myself. This movie definitely sucked big-time.  I was surprised though by how boring it was as I had expected it to at least be enjoyably bad.  First and foremost, the dialogue was really awful.  The characters (especially Jennifer Lopez) kept on going into quirky, ""Tarantino-esque"" monologues.  A few lines (e.g., ""turkey time"") were unintentionally funny but these monologues mostly added nothing except length to the movie.

In addition, the acting was awful.  I don't know if Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez could have done more with better dialogue but the main plot arc seemed really forced.  Affleck (dumb, macho heterosexual) and Lopez (intelligent lesbian warrior-philosopher) are supposed to be polar opposite characters who, during the course of the movie, fall in love and decide to change their lives for the better.  Their falling in love just was not credible though.  Their didn't seem to be any basis for mutual attraction.  In particular, I have no idea what Jennifer Lopez's character saw in Ben Affleck's as he played a total loser compared to her.

The only plotline of the movie that I found remotely credible was of Ben Affleck slowly becoming friends with the handicapped boy that he had kidnapped.  It almost seemed like that was the movie was first supposed to be about but someone rewrote the script to add Jennifer Lopez and a ""romantic"" storyline. Instead of resulting in a blockbuster movie starring two engaged celebrities, however, it resulted in a dud.",1298332800,6,1574,4.965648854961832

1925707,1,B0000DKDUT,"Outside of being part of the Kevin Smith alumni, Ben Affleck has never been a funny guy.  He's a good film-writer and had a couple of good dramatic roles, but he's not meant to be witty.  Matter of fact, after watching ""Surviving Christmas"", his vain attempt at comedy infuriates me.  Mainly, it has to do with his cocky attitude, the way he yells at people out of disgareement and such, not to mention how often he smug.  His abrasive and controlling temperament has never been charming feature of his, and he following this same path in ""Gigli"".

Affleck plays the titular character, a button who was tasked by his loud superior to kidnap someone to keep a federal official quiet. The person he was ordered to sustain was a mentally-challenged man named Brian with Tourette Syndrome (very sensitive subject to follow, especially for a comedy). What Gigli didn't expect next was a house call from Jennifer Lopez, who plays Ricki the hitman; he tried to make a move on her, but she told him she's a lesbian (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/not-this-scenario-again/dp/B00003CX9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">not this scenario again</a>). Now both Gigli and Ricki has to work out their egotistical differences while they're waiting for orders as to what to do with Brian.

The former movie couple were not believable in their roles. It's hard to believe Ben Affleck as a street thug; he's a guy that yells and punches people, but he's no hitman. And Jennifer Lopez fails to portray herself as a lesbian contractor; she didn't act intimidating enough to view her as a criminal, and her spot-spoken tone didn't help her one bit. Her as a lesbian is an ironic joke, because while she proclaims to vacuum carpets with her mouth, she spends the majority of the film being promiscuous towards the thug with no subtlety; she even made a ridiculous vagina monologue while's she stretching her legs in front of him. That's like if a Hooters girl told a customer not to touch her, but then she puts chicken wings on her cleavage for him to grab with his hands. Their relationship is the most cop-out of cop-out couples, and they're the least of the film's problems.

I have a hard time seeing this as a comedy.  It's billed as a romance-comedy, but where are the jokes?  Is a mentally challenged person singing rap songs suppose to be funny?  Is Gigli yelling at Brian and calling him rude names worth the giggles?  Am I suppose to find humor in Ricki's ex-girlfriend who slit her wrists to try to get Ricki's attention?  What's with Christopher Walken and bribing people with pies?  Everyone's so serious with their roles that I can't figure out what I'm suppose to giggle.  Not even a brief scene with Al Pacino, playing the only character that I find partially interesting, manage to put me in a good mood.  All the characters were either conversing or doing monologues, but there's not a hint of humor in any of them; this isn't a smart comedy, the cast are just going along with with the script.

Overall, ""Gigli"" is a cruel, mean-spirited movie which has all the similiar problems with mean-spirited humor akin to ""Duplex"".  It's an exercise in keeping one's composure, dealing with unlikable and hostile characters.  The director of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" lost his luster on this one.",1281744000,9,3312,4.894454382826476
1925708,1,B0000DKDUT,I am very disappointed in Jennifer. This is NOT her best work! The movie seems to be terrible. I don't plan to watch this film again anytime soon. Her movie Maid in Manhattan was the best. I don't know what convince Jennifer to star in such a cheesy film! I recommend anyone not to see this terrible film. It's just downright bad. Everyone doesn't like this film either. And I don't blame them!,1262131200,4,394,4.410958904109589
1925709,3,B0000DKDUT,"Well, sometimes I like to watch movies that most people hate to know what is so bad about them...  You know what? I actually think that it's VERY underrated! Sure, it's not very good and I guess that the acting is bad (who cares?), but it's nowhere near as bad as it's made out to be! It has some fairly funny bits. I really don't understand why it's so hated (because the hate some people have for it is pretty damn extreme)... It's just another silly romantic comedy. It isn't worse than all of the others.

Oh well, my guess is that they hate it only because it's the ""cool"" thing to do. Hell, I bet that some of them liked it, but they're too afraid to say what they really think.",1259280000,,684,4.174242424242424
1925710,4,B0000DKDUT,"Martin Brest is an established, Oscar-nominated director (""Scent of a Woman""). His research here, however, might've been better realized. Bennifer was the going thing, so there was a germ of a cute story. Just because Ben was such a rotten schmuck in ""Chasing Amy"", perhaps Mr. Brest thought he should give a Lesbian a chance. Redemption? Not quite. J-Lo simply wasn't a convincing Lesbian. Keep it simple. Whatever chemistry was there was OK, but what kept me interested was the simple, complete and non-parodied performance of Justin Bartha,  perfect. (Reminiscent of Leo di Caprio in ""Gilbert Grape"").Mr. Bartha was the best part of the fine ""National Treasure"" films, and his natural simplicity of character makes him endearing. He's a talent waiting to be discovered. ""Gigli"" didn't stink as bad as the rap would have it; it's just that the originality wasn't there...less than we expected from the talented Mr. Brest.",1250553600,,923,5.153333333333333
1925711,2,B0000DKDUT,"Gigli is an indefensibly terrible film. Affleck is so terrible that he's guilty of not only overacting but also being extremely annoying. Lopez looks sexy but that's about it. The film lasts for an unendurable two hours and change. The stupid plot has Affleck playing Larry Gigli, a mobster who's constantly being put down by his boss Louis. Louis wants Larry to kidnap a mentally retarded  man who is the brother of a high ranking politician. There's a mobster who's  facing  serious jail time and Louis hopes that the charges will be dismissed once the politician learns that his brother has been kidnapped. After Larry kidnaps the kid and brings him back to his place there is a knock at his door. When he opens it he's  surprised to see a sexy woman named Ricky (Jennifer Lopez). Larry learns that Louis sent her since he doesn't trust Larry to keep the kid hidden. Ricky resists all of Gigli's advances and informs him that she's  a lesbian which pisses him off a great deal. In spite of this deal breaker he lays so much macho b.s. on her that we suffer more than she does in having to endure this for two hours. You won't be surprised to learn that he cracks her tough exterior and she begins to fall for the idiot. The lines that these actors are forced to deliver are embarrassing to say the least. This film introduced the phrase ""Gobble, Gobble"" as a sexual invitation. What makes this movie tolerable are three great scenes. The first one involves Christopher Walken in a bizarre little cameo. He's his reliably weird self who plays a cop looking for information on the kidnapping. Larry is the first person he thinks to question and after his intimidation fails he goes into a rant about Marie Callendar ice cream. Because it's Walken and only he would pronounce words like that the scene is hilarious. The second scene is a discussion about male and female reproductive organs. That's a polite way of putting it since the language used is vulgar and graphic. The scene is sexy though since Lopez is saying these things while doing yoga in some skintight short shorts. The best scene of the film, in my opinion at least, is the Al Pacino cameo. He plays the mobster who is facing the serious jail time and who is responsible for the kidnapping. He's wearing a thick pair of glasses and his gray hair is tied into a ponytail to make him look older. He starts making bad jokes and flirting with Lopez before he turns serious and launches into a speech about what makes a person intimidating. Naturally it being Pacino that includes him yelling at the top of his lungs and throwing F bombs around but it adds some kind of excitement to such a slow and boring film. It is actually some of my favorite work of his. Those three scenes are the only relief you will find in this film so avoid it.",1221955200,3,2801,4.527667984189724
1925712,2,B0000DKDUT,"This flick wasn't as bad as the critics made it out to be. The problem was all of the hype that surrounded it during the ""Bennifer"" craze. Okay, another problem was the fact that Ben Affleck is not believable as ANYTHING! He sucked in ""Good Will Hunting"" but I got the impression that he was just playing himself. But who would be scared of hit man named ""Gigli""? That's what you would name a toy dog!! By the time I saw this movie, Ben had left J-Lo at the alter and I was kinda pissed because she wasted a million dollars on a ""non-wedding"" instead of building a community center in the Bronx. Overall, the story here was pretty good with several humorous moments. You just have to brainwash yourself to forget that these two clowns were once an item and that they allowed their celebreality to overshadow the release of this film. Martin Brest should have sued them both for jeopardizing his project. He obviously believed in the script because he casted such heavyweights as Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. Both actors did well with minor supporting roles. Another standout is Lenny Venito of ""NYPD Blue"" fame. But the public really has a case for intentional infliction of emotional distress!!",1217721600,2,1200,4.691943127962086

Oh my.",1205884800,4,338,4.557377049180328
1925714,3,B0000DKDUT,"There are a number of things that can make a bad movie. One is a bad story. Or how about bad acting? These are the two most obvious because they can be the most easily seen. Bad directing is harder to spot but comes through anyway. But perhaps the worst way a movie can be bad is in notoriety.

GIGLI is a movie that was hyped not as the movie to go see but as one of the worst movies ever made. This was proclaimed before the movie hit a screen. And with all of this negative hype, is it any wonder that the movie sank at the box office? The question is is it really as bad a movie as they said?

The answer is no, it is not nearly as bad as they claimed it was. The sun will continue to rise each morning and the moon at night. Tides will not pass over the coastline and wipe out the beachfronts from sea to shining sea. And movies will continue to be made, some even starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

Affleck stars as Larry Gigli (pronounced like really), a low level enforcer for mobster wanna be Louis. Gigli may be an enforcer, but he's a nice guy deep down as well which doesn't sit well with Louis. Especially on his latest job.

Louis wants Gigli to kidnap a mentally handicapped young man named Brian from an institution and hold on to him until further notice. This is to help a top level Mafioso from the east coast who is being prosecuted by the young man's brother.

Gigli follows through and later find a young lady knocking at his door. Enter Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), another employee of Louis sent to help. It seems that Louis doesn't have much faith in Gigli so he's sent her along as back up.

The expected happens when Gigli puts the moves on Ricki. The unexpected happens when she tells him she is a lesbian. Macho Gigli, a stereotypical male if there ever was one, has his pride squashed. But that changes later when they have the chance of...well watch and see.

The characters evolve as this movie progresses. Gigli is put in touch with who he really is. Ricki gets the chance to see the world a bit differently. And both of them find a fond affection for Brian, becoming more understanding as they get to know him.

So why does everyone hate this movie? Perhaps it's because it moves along a bit slowly. Perhaps because some of the discussions between the two main characters, the main focus of the movie, are frank and up front. My best guess is that it has little to do with these items and more to do with the publicity bandwagon that started with the duo falling in love while the film was being made.

The movie is not all that bad. The story is better than many movies released and the dialogue well written. Affleck's accent may be a tad off but hey, it isn't real life, it's a movie! The appearance of the film, everything from cinematography to lighting was wonderful. Both actors seemed believable in their roles. So what went wrong?

I've read reviews and the things taken apart have seemed nit picky. When stars rise, it seems they become targets. Was the movie going to make strides in film making? No. Was it going to be the next best thing since sliced bread? No. What it was was an interesting story with some good and some bad dialogue.

I guess the biggest mystery to me about this film was why it received such bad press and did so little money at the box office while movies like LEGALLY BLONDE 2 did so well? Now that movie had the content of a well filled diaper. I guess it all depends on the expectations one has when viewing a film. Go in expecting the worst here and you'll be happy.

1925719,1,B0000DKDUT,"Gigli is one of those pitiful knockoffs of the Quentin Tarentino model of filmmaking: Likeable lowlife characters, an offbeat storyline, and quirky dialogue with loads of kitschy humor. Sadly the formula that works so well for Mr. Tarentino doesn't work all for Martin Brest. Awful is an understatement when describing this movie.

Larry Gigli (gee-lee) is a bumbling Southern California mobster assigned by his boss to kidnap the disabled son of a federal prosecutor so they can blackmail him. But his boss doesn't trust him, so he sends a hit woman to help him do the job. Gigli spends most of the movie trying to hit on the hitwoman-but she's a lesbian. In between fights with high schoolers, lesbian lovers, yoga, orders from his boss and arguments, arguments arguments, we're supposed to believe these two try to make us believe there's a romance between them. This must have worked on paper because it doesn't work on the screen. In the end he lets the boy go on the set of Baywatch, his favorite show. (Which was cancelled during the time this movie was made) While he uses pick up lines on an extra, Gigli drives off into the sunset with the hit woman.

I've seen my share of bad movies and this is the new number one worst film I have ever seen in my life. (See some of my other reviews.) Nothing I've endured on a late Saturday Night can compare to how awful this movie is. Not White Chicks. Not Black Samurai. Not even Smurfs and the Magic Flute. The screenplay must have been a collaborative effort between chimps and a box of rocks; they're the only two groups this would make sense to. Perhaps chimps were executives involved in the preproduction too. I mean, how does something this puerile get greenlit for production by a human being? What imbecile would think this script is worth investing millions into? No plot, long rambling monologues, a story that goes round and round in circles, and characters with the personality of wet cardboard decorated with mustard and ketchup. I think a bunch of elementary school kids could come up with a better script than this during arts and crafts.

Director Martin Brest lenses a slow tedious movie that goes nowhere over the course of ninety minutes. In his attempt to add his own distinct flavor to the Tarentino formula, he tries to put a Rain Man vibe to it mixed in with a little Tao of Steve. Blending the softer touch with the gritty characters ends up with a bland derivative movie with no personality and no ideas of its own. Outside of the cinematography the entire movie is a mess. I have to ask one question to the director and producers of this film: Who wears leather jackets in the summertime in Southern California?

Ben Affleck is his usual horrible self here. Watch him use the same facial expression for oh- just about everything. Jennifer Lopez is so hammy here she belongs in a sandwich. She has no chemistry with Affleck and is completely over the top in most scenes. I couldn't believe her as a mob hit woman or a lesbian, she's just J.Lo superstar here again. Oscar winners Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are wasted here their cameos add nothing to this mess. Lanie Kazan is the only actress who manages to pull a decent performance out of this mess. In her cameo as Gigli's Mom she steals the scenes she's in with her warm energy and dynamic presence.

Get as far away from this Tarentino wanna-be as you can. If you like films in this genre, get the real deal from the man himself. Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown or the Kill Bill series are far better than this hackneyed mess.",1177286400,7,3558,4.605678233438486

The truth is it is a bad movie but nowhere near being one of the worst movies ever.  I was expecting something torture to sit through but this movie didn't even bore me.  Much like time wasted on TV when I was young, this movie didn't have much to offer yet entertained me mildly and wasn't a boring or other type of negative experience.

I can't even say this is the worst Al Pacino movie I've seen.  My favorite actor of all time has been putting out a lot of garbage in his most recent work.

Two for the Money and SimOne are first to come to my mind as being much worse movies than Gigli.

I also can't say I can agree with all the Ben Affleck hatred.  I don't think he's such a terrible actor.  Actually, I thought he did a great job in Changing Lanes.  Other films, he has been pretty neutral for me.

I think what they were going for here was a softer ""Pulp Fiction"".  There are some striking similarities at least on the surface.  Both films are about criminals.  Both have at least a dozen or so long speeches delivered by characters that have very little to do with the actual plot.  But that's where the similarity ends.

To begin with, PF wasn't afraid to enter its world of violence.  Gigli, on the other hand, has absolutely no violence whatsoever until the very end.  While it is graphic, it is not the least bit interesting.  Also, because it's the only bit of violence in the whole film, it is strangely distasteful and even perhaps a bit unnecessary.

The plot is absurd.  Never once does it stray into even remote plausability.  Never once did I believe Ben Affleck or Jennifer Lopez were actually criminals.  They never come across as threatening or even in control of the situation.

I'm not going to insult their acting.  Personally, I think everyone in this film did the best they could with what they were given.  I place the blame squarely on the screenwriter.

Also, the movie seems to have as many false endings as ""The Return of the King"".  And the triumphant music at the end is completely out of place.

To be truthful, I didn't want to see it just because of what everyone else was saying and didn't see it until just recently when I finally decided that Gigli may actually be worth a buck to see. I'm glad I spent the dollar, if only to discover that this movie isn't as bad as everyone had said, but it's not good either.

Ben Affleck plays Larry Gigli, an L.A. thug who is hired to kidnap and keep a close eye on a mentally challenged man (Justin Bartha-- National Treasure), who is the brother of some politician who won't cooperate with the mob. In comes Ricki, a tough-talking lesbian (Jennifer Lopez) who is hired to watch over Gigli and make sure he doesn't screw this up. Throughout this escapade, Gigli begins to realize that he has feelings for Ricki, feelings that he professes he's never felt before. He also realizes that his chosen profession isn't exactly something that he wants to do. Ricki feels the same way, on both counts.

What could've been an interesting relationship between Gigli and Ricki is instead made into a love affair. It's not that Affleck and Lopez dont' have chemistry, because they do, it's that they're relationship is, well, awkward. Here we have a tough-talking lesbian who suddenly is fawning over Gigli? What's up with that?? Besides that, the movie is bogged down with too many extra storylines (like Ricki's ex-girlfriend slitting her wrists) and colorful characters (Gigli's mom) for any of the the principal characters to pack on some theatrical weight. Too much is going on in this movie for it to work. What does work, however, is Affleck. He turns in a solid performance as Gigli, perhaps one of his best performances. Too bad it's in a mediocre movie. I even enjoyed Justin Bartha's character, despite how stereotypical it is.

I give this movie two stars, and while normally I wouldn't recommend a two star movie, I'm going to recommend seeing this anyway.

The plot is simple enough. Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a thug, working as an enforcer for a loan shark called Louis (Lenny Venito). Louis is worried about his boss (a cameo by Al Pacino), who has been arrested and charged by a federal prosecutor. Louis instructs Larry to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the prosecutor's mentally-challenged brother. But Louis doesn't trust Larry to get it right, so he sends another ""contractor"", this one a gay woman (Jennifer Lopez) who identifies herself as ""Ricki"", but admits shortly afterwards that it isn't her real name. So now we have the two of them minding Brian, and the stage is set for the (very conventional) conflict between two people working together.

There are some speeches in this script that ring horribly false. The language is frequently coarse. I wonder if the script was originally written for someone like Eddie Murphy - he could have pulled off the speeches about being ""the gangster's gangster"" better than Ben Affleck, for example.

Jennifer Lopez is a lot more threatening in Enough. She is just not credible as an ""enforcer"" in this film. And she wears a ridiculous amount of jewellery for a woman who is supposed to be ready to get physical. She could have been right for this part if the script let her.

Ben Affleck is a lot more credible as a man lusting after a lesbian in Chasing Amy. In this film his performance is spotty, with his apparent intelligence seeming to rise and fall between scenes. I don't think it's his fault, though - I think it's more the fault of the script, and he has been mis-cast for the

This film isn't all bad, but there are some sorry bits. The whole of Christopher Walken's cameo is poor for example (he looks horribly ill), as is Missy Crider's scene (how did she find them?). And there are some (mercifully brief) gruesome moments, one involving a plastic take-away food knife, the other a fish tank. One wonders if the gruesome moments were attempts to make this a black comedy.

All in all, this film feels as though the writer/director (Martin Brest) was indecisive, and unable to choose what kind of film he was making. He has written pieces of a romantic comedy, pieces of a black comedy, and pieces of a gangster comedy, but unfortunately he has assembled them all into the one film, and it just doesn't work. So, although I very much doubt that this is the worst film of 2003, I can see why it has been described that way.",1107302400,9,2647,4.5738396624472575

1925757,5,B0000DKDUT,"People hate this film because it discusses in-your-face topics of sexuality, religion, and the internal unresolved conflicts of self-expression.  20 mins. into the film, I found myself somewhat bored, but I continued watching since I'm a long time Brest fan.  I was not disappointed whatsoever.  Since then, I have seen the film in it's entirety roundabout 5 times.  The dialogue skyrockets as soon as Lopez graces the screen.  This film literally picks a fight with the stereotypes of today's society.

Exhibit A, the ""yoga scene"" where Lopez blatantly and intellectually provides evidence that God could be and most likely is - of female essence.  This totally contradicts everything that we're fed to believe in this egomaniacal, male-dominated existence.  Most men don't take the time to pull their heads out of their a**es to realize that women are far superior to men's strength, intelligence, and sex appeal.  Affleck's character represents 85% of the males in this country who are arrogant, insecure, self-centered, closet-case homosexuals.  Their whole existence in life is to belittle people in order to gain superiority.  They run from their conflicts and trample everyone in their path.  Lopez confronts him and not only wins, but shoves a shiv down his spine. He is rendered defenseless.

People totally missed the point of this film, especially chemistry-wise.  Didn't anyone notice that Affleck's chemistry with the disabled kid(yes, disabled - in working with them I found they are far more intelligent than most of the reviews I've read) was stronger than that of Lopez??  There's a reason for these things people. As the film progresses, Gigli's conflicts are simply addressed, rather than resolved.  This in turn is very realistic, how many of us truly know who we are??

I feel that Charlie Sheen or Jon Favreau could've pulled this role off a bit better, I think Affleck's comedic timing is a little off compared to K. Smith films. However, it doesn't detract from the film. It is quite witty.  The truth is there aren't any young Italian A-listers to play his part.  This isn't an Oscar-worthy film and in my opinion..Thank GOD!! Neither were Fight Club or 12 Monkeys, and just like those 2 films-this requires more than 2 viewings at least.

As far as their careers go, they took a risk. How many of us can say that?

In closing, if you're upset with how Hollywood films are being written and directed, go make your own f**king film until then shut the f**k up.

P.S. Don't call anyone a stupid retard.  The only reason they do it in films is because that's how YOU talk. The slowest learner in his graduating class just taught you something.

To the gents-it's not how fast you learn, but rather that you learn at all.  This film was so simple. How do you degrade a film of this caliber, yet worship the next Predator sequel??  Now, who's the retard?? lol

To the ladies- we're not all Gigli, and we know who we are.

Basically, the money paid to Lopez and Affleck should have been donated to a worthwhile charitable institution instead and the cast (yes, that's including Al Pacino and Christopher Walken) should have their thumbs cut off by a plastic knife. Whoever planned this piece of trash thought Lopez and Affleck, both semi-interesting individuals, are an interesting couple. Lopez is incredibly unsexy and hopelessly unconvincing as a well-read, intellectual, lesbian (""you know what I mean?""); Affleck is just incredibly boring.

The unfortunate thing is that as bad as this film is, it's not the fault of the actors, who are doing their level best to make this thing work. Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, as the main characters, even make for compelling viewing at times.

But their efforts are completely undermined by a script that is jaw-droppingly bad at points (a four-minute monologue on the vagina, for God's sake?), interminable dialogue, hack directing, and two of the weirdest cameos in recent movie history (Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, both of whom apparently made a bet before signing on as to who could chew the most scenery).

Oh, and there's a corpse's finger, cut off by a plastic knife. That's the comic high point.

1925760,1,B0000DKDUT,"When one has a film to watch in mind, one must consider the elements which make up the film. The crucial elements are the actors, directors, and the producers.

Gigli is a bad film, theres no question about this. But if you take a look at who is involved this shouldn't be a surprise.

Ben Affleck has never been an amazing actor and many of his films are not fine motion pictures which leave you speechless.

Terrible Films Include Paycheck, Reindeer Games, Pear Harbor (Special FX do not make a good movie), Bounce and so on..

Good cameo in Boiler Room, Good Will Hunting he will never top and Chasing Amy was a good film.

Jennifer Lopez is mediocre at best in everything she does with the exception of her beauty, which is the only reason she is cast in anything. She is a beautiful woman, but this does not mean she can act or sing. NONE of her films allow her to display her acting ability, or lack there of, because she is incapable of acting. This isn't because she never took acting lessons, but because she is just a naturally terrible actress.

Her films are Hollywood trash as well, i.e. The Wretched Wedding Planner, the Horrible Enough, and The God Awful Angel Eyes. She fit Selena well, but then again she is playing a Latin American singer. The Cell wasn't a horrible film but not due to her acting ability. Out of Sight was entertaining but this does not make her a great actress.

Back to the point:

Placing two mediocre actors in a film with a terrible screenplay equals a horrible movie. The problem with Gigli, or one of the many, is that it is incredibly boring. The acting stinks. The mentally challenged kid is horribly annoying. Plus most of the film takes place in Gigli's apartment. It feels very enclosed and just leaves you with no room. This would be find if it were a Hitchcock film, or a movie built around actors who don't need special effects or amazing choreography.

The dialogue at times is MILDLY entertaining and borders upon interesting and then you realize this movie is going no where.

IF you then add the bias of being sick of J Lo and Ben Affleck to begin with, then add the terrible hype surrounding the film plus all the negative reviews, its difficult to watch this film with a clean slate.

You give it a try and realize this is a bad film. Not even because of the negative reviews which sway your judgement of the film to begin with. There is nothing right here. All great actors and directors have their bad films. But Ben Affleck is no Brando, Newman or Bogart and J Lo is a nobody. Her films barely ever make a profit and Affleck is already a Hollywood joke. He takes ANY role. There is a difference between being selective yet taking chances (as his buddy Damon does) and just taking any role that comes his way.

I thought I might enjoy this film and prove critics wrong like usual, but they are not wrong this time. This is not a film that in time will be recognized as an overlooked flop that is indeed a marvelous film. This is just plain bad even for J Lo and Affleck fans.

1925772,1,B0000DKDUT,"GETTING ""GIGLI"" WITH IT!

My big brother thinks that Jennifer Lopez is the sexiest woman in the world, hands down.  Unlike me, he's also an incurable workaholic who doesn't get out to the movies too much.  So when we both planned to see ""Gigli"", the new J-Lo/Ben Affleck flick, I was a bit worried when I saw the reviews the day before.  After all, I didn't want Jay to waste his rare night out on a bad movie.  And if you read the reviews, you'll know that this movie was supposed to be REALLY bad... as bad as it gets.  But like most movies that the critics vilify without mercy (""Swept Away""), the movie wasn't really AS terrible as they said.  But then again, there ain't much to recommend ""Gigli"" to anyone except bona-fide J-Lo voyeurs.  The casting is bad.  Baby-faced Ben Affleck is only moderately believable as a hardened bad-ass.  Even though his character is presumably from L.A., the accent is definitely ""New York tough guy"".  And even though Jennifer Lopez plays an avowed dyke, her character-- with her dangerously short skirts and peek-a-boo tops-- remains unflinchingly J-Lo-like. OK, OK, so this is supposed to be a lightweight romantic comedy, not Academy Award bait. But even if you could just sit and watch these two attractive leads for the whole length of the movie, you'll still notice that the story is full of holes, and the dialogue is numbingly bad.

Ben Affleck plays Larry Gigli (pronounced ""Jeely""-- rhymes with ""really""), an L.A. gangster who kidnaps a brain-damaged young man-- the little brother of a Federal prosecutor.  Larry holds the charming captive (played by Justin Bartha, who seems to have modeled his character after Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"") in his apartment, hoping that the prosecutor will be squeezed into dropping his case against Larry's boss.  In no time, we meet a mob enforcer named Ricki, played by Jennifer Lopez, who shows up to make sure Mr. Gigli gets the scheme right.  Needless to say, confilicting moralities and complications ensue, the most central one in ""Gigli"" being that Ben's character soon falls for the curvy charms of his new his partner-in-crime.  And, uh oh, there's only one bed in Larry's apartment. Larry may be attracted to the honey-skinned, highlighted Latina that's sleeping next to him, but he soon learns that Ricki is gay. Yep, she's  a lesbiana, a ""pata"".  So poor Larry has to go to sleep with a hard-on.  But not for long.  If this all sounds familiar so far, it's because Ben Affleck fell for a lesbian back in 1997's ""Chasing Amy"", a movie that explored this theme more sensitively and much better.  J-Lo lays on the bed next to Ben in a silky kimono, opening and closing her legs playfully, and tells him,""Show me what I've been missin' my whole life.  Lay some of that sweet hetero-lingus on me!""  Needless to say, the two make love, and predictably, J-Lo gets on top.  Later on, when the duo's little adventure winds down, our heroine tells her new lover, ""Just to be upfront about this, I want you to know that when this gig is over, I'm gonna be leaving.""  So she says...

J-Lo will no doubt provoke some carnal desires from the men in the audience with some gorgeously filmed yoga scenes.  She goes into a long, tittilating (but not believable) monologue about why she prefers the ladies.  This is the second time J-Lo's character goes off into a nonsensical, pseudo-psychological speech in the movie.  Earlier, we're supposed to believe that she uses her gift of gab to ward off a gang of young thugs.

""Gigli"" is a bit claustrophobic, with most of the scenes involving just J-Lo and Ben together in Gigli's apartment or in the car . At some points it's like watching a filmed two-character stage play.  Secondary characters come in and out really quickly: Christopher Walken appears briefly as a suspicious policeman, Lainie Kazan embarrases herself as Affleck's overbearing mother, and Missy Crider engages in some loud histrionics as J-Lo's insecure blonde lesbian lover.  And finally, Al Pacino has a ""stand back, I'm doing some serious acting now"" scene towards the end of ""Gigli"" as a mob boss.  Whether you think that Pacino's acting steals the movie, or is just another embarrassment that fades among the ruins, will depend on how much patience you've had so far with ""Gigli"". The movie finally loses its staginess at the very end.  This last scene, involving the mentally challenged young guy that Larry and Ricki have been watching, is-- admittedly-- pretty cute and well-done.

""Gigli"" is a movie that both J-Lo and Ben may want to forget quickly.  Or maybe not.  Didn't they meet on the set of this film?  Anyway, I can't help imagine that movie buffs twenty years from now will be wondering about a long-lost film called ""Gigli"" where (real life lovers at the time) Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were playing mobsters in a movie together, with a cameo by Al Pacino.  In other words, it might look better (or at least, become a cult classic) in 2023.  Don't say you weren't warned!",1098316800,7,4994,4.761627906976744
1925773,2,B0000DKDUT,"When the Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez drama ""Gigli"" arrived on the scene last year, the critical reviews were immediate and vicious. ""Horrible,"" ""Terrible,"" ""The worst film of the year,"" and even ""The worst film in cinematic history"" were just a few of the comments heaped on this motion picture. A few fire breathers even went so far as to equate ""Gigli"" with such epic bombs as ""Heaven's Gate,"" truly an insult of epic proportions. Some whispered in tones overflowing with sinister connotations that the careers of director Martin Brest, as well as Affleck and Lopez, were possibly finished. All of this tumult inspired me for the first time in quite awhile. As a lover of the truly worst cinema has to offer, I knew I needed to see this movie as soon as possible. I couldn't see it in the theaters, however, because ""Gigli"" was already gone by the time I thought about going! We're talking gone in a week and a half! I vowed to rent the film on DVD as soon as it came out, a vow I didn't quite keep. Bad movies are so numerous that it's hard to keep track of them. I needed to see several other clunkers before sitting down to ""Gigli,"" but when I finally did I was a bit disappointed. The picture isn't nearly as bad as people made it out to be.

""Gigli"" is a bad movie, though. Ben Affleck stars as Larry Gigli (rhymes with 'really'), a rather thickheaded hood responsible for shaking down deadbeats. When we first meet this blustering goon, he's putting a guy in a dryer at the Laundromat for failure to pay his debts to Gigli's boss Louis (Lenny Venito). As bad as this punishment sounds, Affleck's character gets into trouble because he lets the guy go with promises to come up with the money. Louis roars saucy comments at his underling, accusing Larry of being too soft on deadbeats. Despite failures to do what the bosses want, Louis amazingly (and unbelievably) taps Gigli for an even more important job. A federal prosecutor is gunning for Starkman (Al Pacino), the ultimate boss of the organization. In order to put some pressure on the government, someone comes up with the brilliant idea to kidnap the prosecutor's mentally challenged younger brother Brian (Justin Bartha) and hold him for ransom. It falls on Larry Gigli to abduct this fellow and keep him under wraps until Starkman's tormentor falls into line. Aware that his underling might botch the job, Louis sends a hit woman by the name of Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) over to Gigli's apartment to keep an eye on things. Watch the hijinks unfold!

What follows is rather predictable and long-winded. Gigli, who considers himself a conqueror of women, works hard to put the charms on Ricki. Unfortunately, he soon discovers that this beautiful woman has little interest in men. She also has an attitude rivaling the pompous Gigli, so the two spend most of the film arguing about the roles of men and women in relationships as Larry seeks to find a way into Ricki's heart. The movie treats us to one ridiculous scene after another as Ricki challenges the thug's sense of self, including a meet and greet with Gigli's mother (Lainie Kazan in one of the film's few bright spots), comparing female and male genitalia, and a laughable showdown between a group of kids and Lopez's character. More nonsense follows: the moral dilemma arising when Ricki and Larry must decide whether to chop off Brian's finger, the entire subplot of Ricki's disgruntled and mentally unstable girlfriend, and just about any scene with Justin Bartha in it. The conclusion to this film ranks as one of the most unrealistic, sappy denouements I have ever witnessed in my movie watching career, and that's saying a lot.

I could go on and on describing what doesn't work in ""Gigli."" Let's start with the credibility of Affleck and Lopez in their respective roles. Personally, I found it difficult in the extreme to accept either one as tough gangsters. The movie strives to present both of them as fundamentally decent people living a dangerous life, which takes away any sense of thrill almost immediately. You know Gigli won't hurt Brian, and you know Ricki won't either, so the film has nowhere interesting to go after these revelations. And Ricki's sudden acceptance of Gigli as a lover is so beyond reality that it strains belief. A further problem involves the lame dialogue. ""It's turkey time"" and ""gobble, gobble"" rank as only two mediocrities in a movie full of them. I kept imagining women cringing while watching this in the theater. If you can move past these problems, and you probably won't, you can watch the appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino with openmouthed wonder. Why exactly did Walken's Detective Stanley Jacobellis show up at Gigli's apartment, chew the scenery for a few minutes, and then leave never to appear again? I dunno. Maybe Brest felt like Walken could punch things up for awhile. The same goes for Pacino, whose brief performance attains new heights in hysteria. I'm not even going to go into Justin Bartha's ""Rain Man"" rip-off act.

As bad as ""Gigli"" is, the movie is far from the worst thing Hollywood ever foisted off on the public. Lopez is beautiful as always, Affleck doesn't destroy himself in his role, and although the movie runs for a lengthy two hours, the pace does zip along in places. Not surprisingly, the only extra on the disc was a trailer for the film. Wanna bet we won't see a Special Edition any time soon? I want to hear Affleck and Lopez do a commentary track for this movie! C'mon guys, you can do it! If I could stand watching this mess for two hours, you can come together for a group hug and a few comments, right?",1097020800,8,5627,4.703853955375253

Anyway, if it weren't for this guy rigging the review system this movie would have a .2 star rating. BTW: There are only about 10 people in the WHOLE WORLD who liked this movie (They ALL posted on amazon.com).",1095379200,10,894,4.3532934131736525

1925779,5,B0000DKDUT,"So my partner and I (and by partner, I mean my dad) I call him that because he left my mom for me and we've had a love/hate relationship ever since. Let me explain a little bit about our tumultuous relationship over the years. It usually happens like this: 3AM - I wake up just before he tries to stab me in the heart or throw scaulding hot wate in my eyes, all the while he's crying and screaming something about how the chalky taste of lima beans is where the world's chalk comes from, weird I know. Anyway, tonight, after I dodged the searing hot poker that he drove into my pillow, he asked if I wanted to watch Gigli with him, I accepted. So there we are, snuggling in the living room, eating smelts and watching Gigli. Never before have I seen such chemistry and sexual tension between the two leading stars. The only thing I can compare it to would be the sexual tension between Hans Gruber and John MaClane from Die HArd - remember, you were always thinking - when are these guys going to start kissing? Remember? no? That's because there was absolutely NO sexual tension AT ALL between them, all John Boy cared about was removing Ellis's watch from his wife's wrist just in time so that Hans couldn't kill them both and plummet 60 stories to his miserable death. I digress, this isn't a review about Die Hard, is it now? So anyway, in a nutshell - Ben Affleck's supposed to be tough (gay) and a loner who's threatened by others invading his territory. Enter J. LO, another 'hit-man' who is also tough (gay) and then the story unfolds. They hate each other, they love, they hate, they kill, they love, roll credits, begin the stabbing and the crying and the death and the teeth and the ribbing and the lopping and the maiming. Enter the Universal Logo, begin watching Jersey Girl - then start the loving relationship with your father/lover. Roll Credits - The End. Cry.",1095033600,4,1877,4.459302325581396
1925780,1,B0000DKDUT,"Many say this is one of the worst films ever made in Hollywood.  Finally I got a chance to see how bad it could be myself, and, yes, it is really bad.  Some people are trying to defend it, I know, but how can we save this messy film from being where it should be, when it got six awards of the now notorious Razzie Award? -- Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst On-Screen Couple, Worst Director, and Worst Script?  Even 'Battlefield Earth' could not beat this 'sweep.'

In 'Gigli' you see Ben Affleck as 'Gigli' (say 'Gee-lee'), a killer who is hired as debt collector now.  He is so tender-hearted that for all his intimidating speech, he cannot be real bad.  Then, he is assigned a job of kidnapping a mentally-challenged boy, who is a brother to a public prosecutor.  Gigli is so kind that he never threats or uses violence; he talks the boy into leaving the house, promising him to take to 'Baywatch.'  So far, the film is mildly entertaining.

Then, things begin to look bad.  J-Lo's character Ricki is also sent to Gigli's house where the boy is, which means joint-kidnapping plan, which Gigli doesn't like.  But of course this is a film made for the stars, and Ben and Jennifer sooner or later find themselves attracted to each other, as you expect from the very beginning.

In 'Gigli' however, being seductive means J-Lo saying: 'It's turkey time ... Gobble, gobble,' THE immortal lines that would remain in your mind forever.  There is J-Lo's small lecture given to noisy kids, about how to extract eyes and visual memories from your brain, which is totally irrelevant.  There is another lecture on women's sexuality from her, which is as embarrassing as listening to someone else's pillow talk.  And in 'Gigli' these ruses all work!

There is chemistry between Ben and Jennifer, but considering their profiles (at that time), why not?  They are not playing the characters they are supposed to be; they are just what they are, and that's why no one believes the story, that tries to make us believe that they are crinimals.

The weak story meanders for more than two hours, and even if you get the cameos of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, two great New York-based actors.  their turns are at best mundane and ordinary.  And Al overacts again, just like Al when he is bad.

I don't believe it's directed by Martin Brest, but it's true.  The humor of 'Beverley Hills Cop' is all gone; instead, you get a vanity project that ended the same way as the lamentable 'Ishtahl.'  And like that film, 'Gigli' is just boring.  It's bad, and that 'bad' doesn't mean the 'bad' of 'so bad so good.'  It's plain 'bad' -- dull, ineffective, and self-indulgent.",1094688000,9,2668,4.637526652452026

If I'd been chained to the couch and forced to watch it I'd gnaw my own foot off to get away from the tv. Love may be blind, but that is not sufficient reason for otherwise talented actors like Ben Affleck and JLo to make this waste of film. Ugh. Avoid at all costs. Watching this one will definitely turn the viewer into a vegetable.",1094256000,7,486,4.282608695652174
1925782,1,B0000DKDUT,"If you are reading this, than shame on you! That means you've somehow taken an interest in buying Gigli. Before I start my review let me give you 10 reasons why Gigli is such a bad film:

01) No point.

02) The goals of the characters are nonexistant

03) The film runs way too long for a so called ""comedy""

04) It's dialogue is pointless

05) No chemestry

06) Typical family members

07) Cruelty towards the mentally handicapped

08) Romantic ""comedies"" shouldn't involve the Mob or cutting of thumbs

09) NO CONFLICT!

10) Too clichd

Ok, you've made it this far so I guess I should tell you what this garbage is all about. Well, Gigli (Ben) has to kidnap a mentally disabled nephew of a prosecutor in order to keep his boss out of prison (The boss is in the Mob...duh!). No one thinks he can handle it so they send in Ricki (Lake? No...Jen) to help him. Since Ricki's a lesbian, there will be no contact of ""that nature"" between them. And since Gigli's career (as well as Ben's, sadly) is going down the toilet, he must make his boss proad of him.

And the thing about Gigli is that it's a bad movie that doesn't know how bad it is. What was going on at Columbia Pictures?! Were they trying to ride the wave of ""cool"" movies like Glitter or Spice World? Or were they trying to reach a goal of movies so awful they become a catchphrase?

The dvd is barebones. A single trailer that lasts forever. The movie (if you want to call it that) is presented in an anamorphic 2.40:1 Widescreen ratio. Audio is 5.1 and there are other audio options so you can hear ""Gobble Gobble Gobble"" in other languages. Though you may not want to have the audio on because the score is so poor.

By the way, I'm not just saying that its a bad movie. I'M TELLING YOU it is. I rented this from the library, and felt like I needed money for seeing it.

Please, take my and other reviews that this movie is a dirty piece of garbage. We aren't playing with you. It's seriously awful. I don't want to think of how someone could own this DVD without puting it in a faux dvd box saying ""Fight Club"" or even ""Glitter"". This movie is a 'Gigli'!

1925784,4,B0000DKDUT,"Sometimes I think people are too easily influenced by the opinions of those in the media who love to hate-on certain celebrities. Before I viewed this movie for myself, I was prepared to see perhaps one of the worst movies of this generation. Was I pleasantly surprised. This movie is a delightful little romantic comedy that left me with a good feeling and a smile on my face. Its too bad that Jen and Ben's offscreen romantic relationship could not withstand the haters constant barbs because the chemisty between those two is undeniable.

I loved the storyline and acting. Special mention goes out to actor Justin Bartha whose role as an mentally impaired person had me laughing out loud several times during the movie. Listening to him rapping 'Baby Got Back' left my jaw hurting because I was laughing so hard.

This movie does not deserve the ridicule it endured. People should not allow themselves to be so easily swayed by the bias  opinions of others especially those with hidden agendas. We should exercised the God given right of forming our own opinions based on our own likes and dislikes. Have a good day.",1091664000,6,1119,4.757731958762887

Ben Affleck gave some really bad lines and acting, the plot was stupid, the title is horrible, Pachino just came in and did his standard ""Pachino"" role straight out of everything after Scarface(nothing that anyone should sweat over; we've all seen this Pachino before). Giving this movie five stars is about as smart as giving yourself five across the eyes for fun. Just a bad movie. At most, I can't see anyone giving it over three stars.",1091491200,7,500,4.693181818181818
1925786,3,B0000DKDUT,"After hearing what the critics had to say about this movie I expected the worst. While I agree it isn't the greatest movie ever made it certainly has some retaining qualities.

Jennifer Lopez, playing a lesbian hit woman, does a really good job on this project. She is deep, thoughtful and sensitive but understandably hiding behind a tougher exterior. Her character is the soul of the movie. Certain scenes are rather erotic but in a necessary effort to explain the beauty of sex to a less than qualified man, who happens to be played by Ben Affleck. In the scene on the yoga mat Lopez is seductive and enticing but speaking with poetic justice about the differences between the sexes and sex. Lopez grounds the movie by keeping her leading man from acting violently and continuously attempting to find some depth somewhere down inside what appears to be just another shallow hitman.

Ben Affleck is alright in this movie, not much more can really be said. His character is tough and impatient but somehow Affleck doesn't quite have what it takes to pull it off. When he sticks to the sensitive scenes and when he starts to show his love for Lopez's character he becomes more real and some depth in his portrayal can be found.

The star of this film is in my opinion is Justin Bartha who plays a mentally challenged young man who is kidnapped by Ben and Jen. Bartha personifies the innocence and inexhaustible curiosity of the mentally challenged with great skill. He masters the lyrics of rap songs, has a religious obsession with Baywatch and loves to dance making most of his scenes quite entertaining.

So watch it.....it is worth a few hours and won't stay with you forever. The ending is touching and many scenes show a nice blend of compassion and romance. Don't miss Al Pacino, of course, who never has a bad scene! Take the time to make up your own mind about this one.",1091491200,4,1879,4.633633633633633

1925795,1,B0000DKDUT,"I rented this DVD months ago when it first came out simply to see if it could possibly be as bad as critics have said.  I squirmed through it and jotted a few meagre review notes before consigning it to my desk drawer.  I was so embarrassed that I hid my notes under my meagre collection of five porn magazines and prayed nobody would find them.
I was very sad to see Martin Brest's name on this film.  You may recall back in the 80s that this man was talented.  He had promise- he directed the original BEVERLY HILLS COP & the De Niro classic MIDNIGHT RUN. Then at the tail end of the 90s he released his long-time pet project, MEET JOE BLACK; a movie that was half an hour too long despite having Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt in it.  I was squirming in my seat so much near the end, that I was seriously contemplating peeing into my empty coke cup.  But realizing this may have turned me into Dunedin's answer to Pee-Wee Herman (in more ways than one) I put all my willpower to use and made a serious beeline for the bog the second the credits rolled.
By comparison GIGLI is shorter, but also a lot worse and seems to last just as long as MEET JOE BLACK.  On  evidence of his latest feature, Brest deserves to be blacklisted for life.
Anyhoo, on to the ""movie"".  Ben Affleck is cast as Larry Gigli (but he plays Ben Affleck) : a half-witted, chauvinistic hitman assigned the task of  kidnapping an autistic kid who has the ability to learn the lyrics to rap songs  (why?).  In the biggest stretch of her acting career, Jenny From The Block plays Ricki;  a fellow contract killer who also happens to be a lesbian,  who is bought in to help the autistic kid change Larry's nappies & look after crime lord Al Pacino (in his biggest career embarrassment since 1985`s REVOLUTION).
 Through the course of the ""movie"" Ricki manages to make over Larry from a chauvinistic hitman, to Ben Affleck (the man who accepted an Oscar for a screenplay that two- time Oscar Winner William Goldman doctored. And who hasn`t penned doodly-squat since.  Hey, his autograph`s all he needs to  know how to write!).  They fall in love,  & the kid conveniently disappears from the flick altogether so we can suffer through more pointless Bennifer moments.  In fact the ""plot"" just seems to be a patchwork of bits and pieces thrown in.  Some may be horrified to learn that the movie was originally LONGER but some scenes were cut because preview audiences didn`t like them.  But Hollywood couldn't give a hoot about the opinions of the  people: they spoon-feed us their tripe and we movie buffs keep coming back because we're masochists at heart.
In all fairness, GIGLI could have been palatable if Brest had chose to shoot the film digitally, as Mike Figgis did with his film TIMECODE.  One frame the movie as we know it, and the remaining three J.Lo's butt wiggling from different angles. Then the film could have been retitled JIGGLY and released with the faint hope that dirty old men in trench coats may unwittingly turn this into a sleeper hit. Oh, well. At least the sleeper part is accurate.
The condensed version of my review could read like this:  GIGLI ranks alongside GLITTER and  SWEPT AWAY as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  And isn't it ironic to note that ALL THREE of those movies had pop divas as the leads?  Maybe this was one of  Saddam Hussein's ""weapons of mass destruction"" that Dubya was on about. If that's the case, then I'm beginning to think that war WAS justified after all.  For the love of God, PLEASE don't waste your time with this!",1086480000,10,3550,4.492979719188767

1925797,1,B0000DKDUT,"My friends and I decided to rent this one Friday night, thinking it couldn't possibly be as bad as we heard. We were wrong of course; It was much much worse. The plot was nonexistant, the dialogue was horrible, and the two leads had no chemistry whatsover. The only redeeming quality was Justin Bartha, who played Brian. Poor kid thought he was getting a big break by being in a Bennifer movie. Tough Luck!
Three things went through my mind while watching this mess.
1-How in the world did this movie get greenlit?
2-How could Martin Brest, the writer/director of ""Scent of a Woman"" be behind it?
3-When will this trash come to an end?
There is absolutely nothing for me to recommend Gigli, not even to see how bad it is. That's exactly what we wanted to know and every one of us regretted it. One friend fell asleep, the other could take no more and left, while the rest of us said if we could sit through the whole thing, we could accomplish anything. Well, we did it, but for what? Gigli was ultimately pointless, possibly the worst film ever made. Why? Because while other films know they are bad and laugh at it, Gigli takes itself seriously, making it a hell of a lot worse than it should have been. It was a shame seeing such a talented supporting cast (Lainie Kazan, Christopher Walken, Al Pacino) wasted away. What was Martin Brest thinking? What were the actors thinking? You'd expect this from J. Blo, but Al, Lainie, and Chris? NO!

1925798,1,B0000DKDUT,"I'd heard the bad reviews, but I figured, hey, it's crime thriller and it's got Jennifer Lopez.  How bad can it be?
Really bad.  Boring bad.  Stupid bad.
I feel ripped off, because before I rented the DVD, I read the back of the box, and it sounded like a crime thriller.  Jennifer Lopez is a lesbian assassin.  Ben Affleck is a hood.  They team up for a dangerous assignment.
I was expecting car chashes, gunplay, fisticuffs.  Bodies and cars flying through store windows, and pitched machine-gun battles.  Real DIE HARD/LETHAL WEAPON type stuff.
There was none of that.  There's one quick shooting, near the end, and that's it.
The rest of the film is HE SAID, SHE SAID as Lopez and Affleck debate the merits of lesbianism vs. hetero men, and other sex & relationship type stuff.  At one point Affleck ""opens up"" to Lopez, revealing his true ""inner feelings.""  His thuggish Italian character looks on the verge of tears.  Lopez's tough lesbian assassin is emotionally torn.
The film is also part FORREST GUMP/RAIN MAN.  See, they're lugging around this retarded adult they've been ordered to kidnap, slowly ""bonding"" with the retarded adult, becoming surragate parents, in effect.  Afflect regrets yelling at the retarded adult earlier in the film, and makes it up by giving him fatherly advice, while Lopez looks on warmly, feeling all gushy over seeing Affleck's ""sensitive side.""
The retarded adult keeps wanting to ""go to Baywatch"" (he means the beach), and they take him there.  Affleck looks on warmly while the retarded adult, newly confident after receiving Afflect's paternal wisdom, makes new friends.  Seeing his retarded protege making new friends in the ""normal world,"" Affleck gets a lump in his throat.
It's too tame to be a crime thriller.  No action, no adventure, no guns or car chases or explosions.  Yet neither is it a chick flick.  It's a very long, boring mishmash.",1084665600,5,1890,4.886792452830188

Luckily the other people I saw the movie with were, shall we say, intoxicated so the fact that it was terrible didn't bother anyone, and we got a few laughs out of Ben Affleck's diabolical acting. Jennifer Lopez is in the movie too, meaning that if you wanna see these two ... on-screen together... then it may be worth the price of admission.
The storyline is hilariously awful. There's a mentally disabled kid who is with Ben Affleck. Jennifer Lopez is somehow put on the case, because she is the plucky asassin cop. Jennifer Lopez is introduced to us as a lesbian, but it seems that she's actually one of those magic Hollywood lesbians that also like men, or ""bisexual"" to you and me. Miraculously, the ""lesbian"" - wait for it... ""hadn't met the right guy yet"". This is probably about as tasteful as telling an Asian person that they have different eyes because he hasn't tried stretching them out yet. It turns out that the script writers really had no clue what Jennifer Lopez's character was meant to be, and neither did the audience. I'd probably be offended if the movie wasn't so bad.
You almost want to like it, but the odds are really against it. Nothing else in the movie compares to the moment where Ben Affleck is told that, for some reason, he has to hack off the mentally disabled kid's thumb, and he instead enters a hospital morgue and removes a thumb from a dead body - with a plastic fast-food fork (think I'm kidding?). But the writing is nothing compared to the acting. The so-called mentally disabled kid isn't really mentally disabled, which is obvious, but usually the actors do a better job than they did here. In fact at the end he gets his groove on on the beach, during a Baywatch shoot (this is when I had to leave).
Really, Gigli is just all-around [crud]. ""Never, ever let this film pollute your eyes"" - unless of course you were in my situation and could enjoy it in good humor.",1083542400,6,2101,4.45974025974026

  The dialogue is terrible, the acting made me question how anyone involved could possibly be offered another job, and even the sound quality is poor. It is an all around, bad movie. It is bad movie perfection. I recommend it to everyone, because everyone should get to laugh this hard at least once in their lives.
  The first Ben Affleck rant about his reputation as a tough guy, is worth the price of the movie. And then there are the cameos. Christopher Walken's delivery is mind-blowing. There is no way to comprehend it. The only acting performance that is nearly as confusing and ridiculous, is Al Pacino's. There is no excuse, short of drunkeness, to explain Pacino's performance. It is pure bliss to watch.

When i finally did see it i could tell why it didn't do well but couldn't see why everyone was calling it the worst movie of 2003. Firstly one of the movies many problems is that its uneven and characters pop up for no reason. also the speechs they make, for excample jennifer charater talking to the boys in the restrauent because they were being to loud, well those types of things made it realy boring. But despite all this Jennifer lopez is dazzaling and does a good job but this isn't shown because of all the bad press its recieved. another good point - Ben and jen do have an excellent chemisrty  together!  In conclusion Gigli won't be winning any oscars anytime soon but is still enjoyable.",1082505600,,993,4.391304347826087

But what's worse, is that the average bone headed American let the critics tell them what to think and never gave the film a chance.  It's so typical really.  Everyone wants to agree with (...), god forbid we disagree on something.

1925807,1,B0000DKDUT,"As we speak Ben Afflec and Jennifer Lopez are about to appear in the sequal to this bad movie.  In a few weeks the sequel to Gigli Jersey Girl opens.  Didnt hollywood learn that we don't want to see them in a movie, we'd rather see people ACT!  I say avoid Gigli AND its sequel Jersey Girl at all costs!!!  Does Hollywood think people will jsut go see anything???!!  Do they think we're all stupid?!?!?",1079568000,4,402,4.306666666666667
1925808,4,B0000DKDUT,"So, the news out of Hollywood is that Ben Afflect does not want to do any more action movies in general and a sequel to his 2003 hit ""Daredevil"" in particular.  After the failure of ""Paycheck"" he is ready to give up on the genre and has declared that his next film, ""Surviving Christmas,"" represents ""me trying my hand at comedy.""  Having read that, I know understand more than ever why the biggest thing wrong with ""Gigli"" is Ben Afflect.  He did not know it was a comedy.
Affleck's performance stands out like a sore thumb in this 2003 film.  He hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" last week and he appears only slightly more comfortable in this film than he did in some of the lame skits he was put into on live television.  Affleck plays the title character in ""Gigli"" (apparently there are pronunciation issues with the name), and he is supposedly the muscle for Louis (Lenny Venito), a foul-mouthed L.A. mobster.  However, that would be ""muscle"" in the tradition of Rocky Balboa in the first ""Rocky,"" except with less muscle and maybe less brains.  He talks tough (he's apparently the ""Sultan of Slick""); so tough that it is clear he is way over his head in this business and that is before Louis comes up with the stupid idea of kidnapping the mentally retarded brother of a federal prosecutor to help out a New York City mob boss.
So, Gigli abducts young Brian (Justin Bartha) from his care facility and takes him home, where he is joined by Ricki (Jennifer Lopez).  She is everything that he is not, by which I mean she has serious presence as a mob enforcer, is a woman, and a lesbian.  Now, at this point we are supposed to acknowledge the heavy presence of the Bennifer phenomena and talk about how the on-screen chemistry between the two stars, who were either going together or actually engaged at this point in their roller coaster relationship, is below that of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman let along Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.  But my point of reference at this point was actually ""Chasing Amy,"" the first film in which Affleck's character fell in love with a lesbian and discussed the merits of heterosexual versus homosexual sex.
The best scene in this film is when Gigli and Ricki make a case for their respective genitalia.  He delivers his bit standing up, shirtless, making forceful gestures.  She responds while reclining on the floor showing off her abs and doing stretching exercises that are almost as persuasive as the words she speaks.  When she is done even Gigli knows she is right, which is saying something since so little gets through his thick head.  But after that his character starts to calm down a bit and while Affleck never really fits into the movie, he pretty much stops going against the grain at that point.
There are other noteworthy scenes in this film, although they all have to do more with characters than plots as a series of supporting characters come in have shining moments.  At one point while everybody is hiding out there is a knock on the door and in works Christopher Walken, who plays a cop and delivers what may well be the most eccentric line reading of a speech in his legendary career of eccentric line readings.  Lainie Kazan plays Gigli's mother who certainly does not respond in the traditional way to learning that the beautiful woman her son is with is a lesbian.  Then there is the mob boss from New York City, who turns out to be Al Pacino; say no more.  This might be a three star movie but it has all these five star scenes that help keep it afloat.  No way this was the worst film of 2003; that has to be ""My Boss's Daughter.""
Yes, there are holes in this plot.  You think that kidnapping the mentally retarded brother of a federal prosecutor is not something that is going to get covered on the news?  So taking Bryan out in public is pretty stupid.  But then if reality was the true standard for this film then neither Gigli or Ricki would be mob muscle, so there.  The end of the film leaves a lot to be desired because it stumbles around trying to find something to pass off as a happy ending: I was thinking along the lines of putting Bryan on a plane to Australia (because Down Under is a key part of this film).  But things drag out so long that you have plenty of time to make up words to a title song for ""Gigli"" to the tune of ""Gigi.""  Still, it is hard not to have some affection for a film that so many people hate just because of a quartet of scenes that offer memorable performances.",1079395200,8,4474,4.480295566502463

Who ever wrote the script deserves to live in poverty for the rest of his/her life ( I think it's a her).

I wish they were killed in the middle of the film, at least it would have subtracted another worthless hour of this mess.  Al pacino does his usual over-the-top performance and it's the first time I wish he died in this film too. PLEASE do not watch this movie!!

Midnight Run happens to be one of my favorite films of all-time.  Gigli actually tries to be Midnight Run on more than one occasion, along with Rain Man, Chasing Amy and any number of Elmore Leonard filcks.  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are atrocious.  Affleck's Brooklyn by-way-of Boston accent is comical.  His scene where he's flexing his muscles for a closet mirror is grounds for black-listing.  And I'm not even going to elaborate on his come-ons to Lopez.  She's not quite as bad, but her speeches on the female anatomy and ""people skills"" couldn't have been written by a human.  Then there's Al Pacino and Christopher Walken.  Hoo-ahhh!  Pacino's just plain awful - a completely stupid, over-the-top performance than he's been giving us more often than not lately (and yes, that includes Brest's Scent of a Woman, a completely overrarted film).  As far as Walken, he basically regurgitates his True Romance-Bluloo Boyle speech, then suddenly starts talking in some strange alien language where I honestly needed sub-titles.  And then he was gone.  There is so much wrong with Gigli, you could write a college thesis on the subject.  I haven't even touched upon the mentally disabled character.  The music.  Gigli's boss.  I haven't even scratched the surface.  But let this be said.  As far as bad movies go, this is right up there with the best (worst) of them...

I think Jennifer Lopez is awesome. Love her music and most of her movies.  I like Ben Affleck well enough and enjoy some of his movies. This movie was a different story.  They did not have chemistry and the most interesting part was the charachter Brian.
The thing that really sticks with me is the fact that J-lo is playing a lesbian, yet she gives in to Ben Affleck and sleeps with him. WHY????  I was just really bothered by that and it just seemed totally unbelievable to me. People just don't change their sexuality overnight.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW.
This is a subtle movie.  No, there are not many explosions in the movie.  It is a highly ironic story about relationships and the role of sex and gender.  It is a clever juxtaposition of the heterosexual Larry who exhibits an apparently high machismo factor.  You think that Larry wins over the lesbian Ricky.  What you could fail to notice is how feminized Larry's character becomes without his conscsious awareness of the transformation.
Fascinating!
How many movies have subtleties this deep??
The dialogue is witty (not Kevin Smith-clever, but clever enough) and the movie plays like a series of vignettes with supporting characters coming in and quickly out of focus.  Many have criticized this movie for dropping characters -- yet they do not see the cinematic conceit intended by the director/writer.  Yes it is improbable -- but no more so than Pulp Fiction.  The situations are SUPPOSED to be comic/surreal, and they are entertaining to say the least.
Look, if you want cookie cutter movies, keep looking.  If you appreciate diversity in your films, rent it and make up your own mind.  I would have given this 3.5 stars if I could, but went with 3.  Not an Oscar winner but an intriguing diversion.  I think Affleck's acting could have been better which resulted in a lower rating.

1925835,2,B0000DKDUT,"Gigli, the highly unsuccessful film of 2003 has been called so many horrible things, there is no need for me to list them.  I honestly had some hope for this film when I saw trailers for it, because I never pictured it to be this bad.  Also the film had a fine director, Martin Brest who made such critically acclaimed films as Scent of a Woman and Midnight Run along with Beverly Hills Cop.  Ben Affleck amazingly gave a watchable performance as Larry Gigli, a mobster.  Jennifer Lopez plays Ricki, Larry's love interest who turns out to be a lesbian.  The plot of this film could actually be called original but it just isn't a bit appealling.  It was also very boring and not at all entertaining.
  Gigli rated R for Pervasive Language, Sexual Content and Brief Strong Violence.  The film contains non-stop profanity, infact according to People magazine, the f-word is used 75 times.  The sexuality is reasonable, mainly one semi-explict sexual situation and sexual innuendo but no nudity.  The violence includes a point-blank shooting and a cut off thumb.
  Not at all worth seeing, I sadly saw it in theatres in addition to 3 other people.  I wonder what will become of Martin Brest's reputation as a film director, it looks like he should make a movie based on a bestseller instead of writing something from the top of his head or maybe he should've casted other actors besides Ben & Jen.  In a way I feel bad for him but I feel more disappointed in myself having lost a precious 2 hours of my life.  Definetly winner of worst film of 2003 or at least a solid nominee.  Funny this is there were other films in 2003 which did worst then Gigli and no one even noticied them.  These films include, Marci X, which only made $900,000.  Grind which made $2.6 million.  The Order also performed at the box-office taking in about $4.3 million.  Other flops included, My Boss's Daugther, Dumb & Dumberer & Duplex.  So all in all there have been films that have been much worse then Gigli.  Gigli taking in only $3.8 million and costing an astounding $54 million to make which will be remembered as one of the worse films ever made.  Is it possible the duplicate the success of Gigli, who knows?

1925837,2,B0000DKDUT,"A collision of sex comedy, gangster motif, psychobabble and ""Rain Man,"" Martin Brest's ""Gigli"" is an unmitigated disaster of so many inconsistencies and opposing genres that it feels like the movie plays more or less at random, and would nod at being straight satire if a sentimental musical score didn't give it away. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez began their spotlighted courtship with this film, and no wonder they came together: Humans need shelter in storms.
Affleck is the title character, Larry ""rhymes-with-really"", a head-banging thug charged with kidnapping the autistic brother (Justin Bartha) of a federal prosecutor who means to indict a New York crimelord (Al Pacino). Ricki (Lopez) is an independent contractor brought in to baby-sit the both of them.
In reality, nobody's heart is in the kidnapping, including writer/director Brest, who uses the lesbian Ricki as a platform for his ideas on the gender identity war - we get the bull/cow argument, and a penis vs. vagina summit. Affleck's Larry is a bumbling, chauvinistic fool without class or even much self-control; within days, Lopez, whose creepy performance never rises above a whisper, has deprogrammed his entire thinking. In fact, Larry seems closer in intelligence and ambition to Bartha's autistic, who memorizes rap songs and fades in and out of cinema self-awareness whenever the plots see fit.
Entire chunks of ""Gigli"" were left on the cutting room floor after failed test screenings, and what remains is an odd series of walk-on cameos with no direction or purpose. Christopher Walken is a cop who drops by to question Larry about the kidnapping. He promptly disappears. A former lover of Ricki's drops by to attempt suicide, she is taken to the hospital, she disappears. There's a quick visit to Larry's mother (Lainie Kazan). Pacino's gangster drops by to shoot a guy in the head, scream a little, then tap his heart in that oh-what-a-day-it's-been! thing Pacino has adopted.
And Brian, the Bartha character, disappears whenever Brest wants to clear time for his two stars; at one point he left alone in Larry's apartment. Then again, he also spends a lot of time  in the backseat of Larry's convertible as the two contractors drive around LA. In this era of around-the-clock TV crime coverage, are these scenes to be believed?
Brest has been building toward this kind of boondoggle for years. He wrote and directed ""Scent of a Woman,"" a good movie that was a bit full of itself. Then he directed ""Meet Joe Black,"" a very long movie very full of itself. Brest is a talented writer, and there are lines - entire scenes, in fact - in ""Gigli"" that work extremely well.
But several of his bits are dated (Brian loves ""Baywatch""), one monologue piles on another, and by the movie's nearly 20-minute epilogue, we have grown tired of Affleck's glassy-eyed faraway stare, Lopez's furrowed, understanding brow and the idea that we're supposed to care who's bull, who's cow, who's straight or scared or gay or dirty or clean or, most of all, whose turkey's about to gobbled.",1072051200,14,3047,4.986247544204322

It finally reached them with the screenplay for a movie called Good Will Hunting (1997), that earned them the Oscar for best screenplay. Their names were Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
Damon, clearly the best actor of them both, chose to continue his career carefully chosing his next movies. Affleck, on the other hand, seems to have been bitten by the infectious virus of fame and money, opting for starring only in utterly commercial and wanna be blockbusters movies, like Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, etc, where he simply did not need to act. His wooden face and good looking was enough. I thinkg he was the perfect actor for GODZILLA, instead of Matthew Broderick....(just joking)

Frankly, it was highly improbable that a movie could be denounced as fervently as this one and be -gulp- the worst movie ever made, right?  Wrong wrong wrong.  There are some trite little movies that are so ridiculously terrible that they reach an apogee of unintended hilarity (I cite Cool As Ice, Vanilla Ice's debut film).  This is definitely not one of those films.  It took every fiber of my being to conclude viewing this.  There were indeed points when I thought my sanity would collapse, points were I literally became so disgusting lachrymose I would let out a caterwaul of horrendous pain.

1925867,5,B0000DKDUT,"When Gigli came out everyone said that this is the worst movie ever.  Thus, I had to see it for myself.  When I came out of the movie theater after watching Gigli, I thought to myself ""God those critics are morons!""  Gigli was wonderful.  It was original and entertaining.  I titled my review for this movie ""Expectations Ruin Everything"" because I believe that this movie would have been a hit if audiences hadn't expected Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck to get together in the end.  I think that when critics went to see this movie they thought it would be a standard romantic comedy.  However, when they ended up seeing an original, funny, unromantic, kind of sassy movie, their expectations were not met, therefore they were not satisfyed.
Before I saw Gigli i read a synopsis of the movie to see what the actual storyline was.  Because of that, I already knew that Jenn Lopez was a lesbian so i didn't expect her and Ben Affleck to get together.  Therfore,my expectations were met along with seeing a movie with comedy and coolness.--I enjoyed the movie.
Also, how can Gigli be coined ""the worst movie ever"" when nobody saw it.  It only made 6 million dollars at the box office.  Nobody saw it, therefore how can they judge it?  Dont believe the hype, my friends.  Contrary to popular belief, Gigli was a great movie.
I conclude my comment by saying that if you want to see a movie that(unlike almost all other movies)lacks a romantic situation but is packed with good, sometimes funny, sometimes just plain cool entertainment, then see Gigli.

1925868,4,B0000DKDUT,"GIGLI was pegged a Loser even before it was released in the theaters.  Many critics called it the worst movie ever made AND audiences stayed away in droves.  How much of that was due to 1) a title that people unfamiliar with Italian couldn't pronounce correctly, 2) the media invasion of the private lives of stars Lopez and Affleck, or 3) an outdated but still festering homophobia  reaction to the idea of Jennifer Lopez playing a lesbian remains to be seen.  Or there may have been difficulty/comfort  in accepting brain-damaged characters both created by actors and by patients.  Whatever the reasons this film seems to have not been actually viewed for its own merits.
Director and screenplay writer Martin Brest has created a smart film and knows how to handle touchy subjects as sensitively as the best of them.  The plot line is fairly simple: Affleck is a Mafia-like LA gangster enlisted to kidnap the brain-damaged young brother of a prosecutor, the mob thinking that this will make the prosecutor drop charges against a major gangster (a tasty little cameo for Al Pacino).  Not trusting Affleck's character to carry out his job, the mob enlists the backup of another important gangster (Jennifer Lopez) who just happens to be lesbian and thus not readily vulnerable to the macho plans of Affleck's ego.  From the moment Lopez knocks on Affleck's door there is a chemistry that only the blind eye could miss.  The three (two gangsters and their kidnapped victim) gradually work through the many thorns along the way of the story including a love scene and a confrontation scene between the leads, a hilarious but warm encounter with Affleck's mother (Lainie Kazan in an absolutely bravura performance) who shows understanding about Lopez' sexual orientation seeing the whole spectrum of sexuality with its still open door for a perfect wife for her son, and a brief but equally pungent role by Christopher Walken who smells the plot.  Actor Justin Bartha lends enormous credibility to the role of the brain-damaged lad and it is his character along with Lopez' that eventually lead (and accompany) Affleck's humanization.  And Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are beautiful and exciting to see as a new screen pairing.
Yes, there is a love story and a comedy here, but far more important, there is a presentation of an opportunity to examine our own prejudices and misconceptions.  And for that reason (among many others) this is a film that deserves a much wider, much more open audience.  Give it a chance!",1071100800,7,2516,4.931279620853081

While the movie's plot lingers a bit, the movie is very enjoyable. Lainie Kazan and Al Pacino make excellent guest appearances, though both strange and far different from each other! I hate Ben Affleck and you can guess why, but I have to admit he and Jen DO HAVE a lot of chemistry together, and it's actually not annoying to watch.

1925878,3,B0000DKDUT,"'Gigli' is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  In fact, it's actually decent.  I will say if you don't enjoy hearing about the celebrity relationship at hand, skip it.  The onscreen interactions between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are mainly centered around romance, which is misleading since 'Gigli' was supposed to be a drama.  But knowing what cultivated from their working together, all we can see is Ben and Jen, Hollywood's most infamous couple.  Therefore it's hard to believe that J.Lo is a lesbian and that both work small time in the mob business.  The only thing that saved the movie is the comedy.  Affleck is particularly funny with his Soprano-like voice and his selfish, ""gangster's gangster"" demeanor.  Even Justin Bartha, who plays the retarded boy, manages to generate a few choice laughs (his tourette's takes the cake).
Simply put, the plot for 'Gigli' is very, very weak.  Affleck's character of Larry Gigli is assigned to kidnap the brother of a federal prosecutor in order to free his boss from numerous charges.  Then everything is thrown for a loop when Ricki (Lopez) is sent to ""watch over"" him, and vice versa.  Larry's self-image and ego are then truly seen as he brags about his place in the business, though it only comes off sounding like an ""I don't need a woman to do my job""-type thing.  Then things are again heightened as Larry puts the moves on Ricky; only for him to sadly discover she is a lesbian ('Chasing Amy' anyone?).  From there it's hard to tell if the two are close friends or callous enemies.  Whatever the case may be, the two soon find their job revealing more then they can handle.  In time, the plot and actions develop into nothing short of your basic mediocrity.  But, overall,  the comedy and cameo appearances by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino make for a decent, worthwhile film.
It is hard to categorize this movie.  It succeeds mostly at comedy, though the drama that develops with the kid is somewhat amiable; the romance is just one of those things that needs to be taken with a grain of salt if you want to enjoy yourself.  If you are a big fan of either Lopez or Affleck, you will probably walk away from 'Gigli' thinking it was worth your time.  However, if you're looking for an enticing mobster/crime drama, you'll walk away chanting the bad names already associated with it (one example: ""a big fat turkey"").  I enjoyed this film mainly because Ben Affleck is one of my favorite actors, though I can obviously see why critics would hate it.  But as you should know, critics are not always right.

Less than perfect, this film carries nonetheless a certain charm that continues to tickle the imagination long after the credits roll.
Martin Brest made a courageous attempt on a non-conventional story-line, but proper promotion of the film fell through.
This is a love story about two geek misfits who somehow manage to work ego's the size of large heavenly bodies. The story is laboring and pensive.  The direction is weak, slightly careless. The film is fun. The film is sexy. Even the ending, which is a comprimise provoked by test audience reaction to the desperate impossibility of attraction between the two, is a playful, intriguing conclusion.

Let's cut em off at the pass""  It got to be where the characters seemed to get confused as to how to place the emphasis on the words making for the feeling of ""What did they say?""
The plot wasn't too bad but it was as if some of the scenes came from a different movie.  Some scenes would go on forever and others would end before you could figure out what there purpose was.
Is this the worst movie of the year?  Possibly not, but if you really have to see it then wait until it's been out on video for a while so you can rent it cheap.",1060300800,8,846,3.7457627118644066
1925906,1,B0000DKDUT,"It would be difficult to find a movie more loathsomely, hilariously bad than ""Gigli."" Despite the tabloid buzz about its two photogenic yet stiff stars, interest in Gigli was generally restricted to the repulsed excitement of watching a train zooming toward a stalled car.
Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a minor-league thug without much in the way of brains or talent. He's ordered to kidnap and imprison the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor, and he does so. After he's stashed Brian (Justin Bartha), in his apartment, Gigli gets a shock: His boss has sent Ricki, a hitwoman (Jennifer Lopez) to keep an eye on him.
Lacking a brain, Gigli immediately begins pursuing Ricky, only to be semi-rebuffed by the announcement that she's a lesbian. Of course, he doesn't give up, and eventually despite her disgust for the male anatomy, Ricki starts to reciprocate his attraction. But things go haywire again when Gigli's boss decides to play nasty.
Given the number of plot holes, ""Gigli"" should not be compared to Swiss cheese -- it should be compared with a fishing net in the advanced stages of decay. Through most of the film, it seems like the director just started direction, then walked off the set and said, ""Seeya! I'm sure you know what to do next.""
""Gigli"" doesn't know whether it wants to be a crime movie, a drama, a romance, or a black comedy. So it tries to be everything, and accomplishes nothing. Needless gore, stupid plot twists (Gigli sawing off a corpse's thumb with a plastic utensil?), and completely unfunny material (the lesbian lover slashing her wrists) deprive this of all humor. But it might have struggled its way to mediocrity, if it weren't for the ghastly dialogue. (And that horrific shot of Mrs. Gigli's butt)
I can only conclude that whoever wrote this movie was either on crack, or possesses a level of ineptitude on par with the title character's. ""Gigli"" contains some of the worst dialogue ever, including the insane ""bull and cow"" discussion, Lopez's bizarre ""turkey time, gobble gobble"" seduction, and the hideously embarrassing and frighteningly written argument about the pros and cons of male and female genitalia. It'll make you laugh or cry, or both.

Affleck clearly has no idea what he's doing, and so wings it with an over-the-top, drawling imitation of Tony Soprano. Yet somehow he doesn't go over-the-top enough to make fun of himself (now THAT would be funny). Jennifer Lopez, with her perfect makeup, provocative yoga and baby voice, can't make her character even halfway convincing. You can't believe she's a thug, a lesbian, or that she could gouge someone's eyes out. Bartha might be good if he weren't retreading ""Rain Man."" Cameos by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino can't save the story, although they are briefly entertaining to watch, being the only actors of worth that we get to see.
There are one or two moments of actual humor in ""Gigli,"" such as the moment where the all-but-illiterate Gigli reads the tabasco sauce bottle. But a few flickering moments can't even begin to save the horrendous turkey that is ""Gigli."" Gobble gobble.",1059955200,78,3101,4.940613026819923
1925907,3,B0000DKDUT,"""Gigli"" will go down as 2003's film that everyone hates to love or one that everyone enjoys hating. Is it a muddle? Yes. Are there script holes large enough to drive a 1974 Chevy Impala Convertible through? Yes. Are there whole scenes that can and should have been cut? Yes. Will Gay Women fundamentally object to some of the plot and motivation points? Yes. And will they be correct? Yes.
But with all that said and agreed upon, ""Gigli"" is not a total failure due to the charm of it's leads; though Affleck's Guys and Dolls portrayal of a hood is definitely one he will never live down.
But Lopez saves the day with her innate humanity and charisma. Say what you like about her, Jennifer Lopez is luminous on screen in the same way that Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz are: they all glow from within with an inextinguishable fire that lights up the screen.
Al Pacino and Christopher Walken make cameo appearances that shoot through and, like gigantic thunderbolts, demolish all in their paths. But in what movie are they acting?
The music is particularly irritating, imposing itself when it should be quietly underlining a scene.
Yes, there is a lot wrong with ""Gigli"" but it is still a success on a modest scale. So, do not be afraid there is some truth and a lot of humanity to be found here. It's just too bad you have to dig so deep to find it.",1059955200,4,1349,4.465587044534413
1925908,1,B0000DKDUT,"What was Jennifer Lopez thinking of. It was absolutely bad enough that she is engaged to Ben Affleck, but unfortunately it seems just like a publicity stunt to see how much they are in love. Even the movie seemed as if it was a bigger joke, and it is a big joke. I really didn't like Gigli. There was absolutely no chemistry the couple had in the film. The film was really just awful, and I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see it. To be honest with you, I think it is just a shame that Jennifer Lopez oxerexposed herself too much within her movie career. She had better try for a better movie role next time. I think they should've given the role to Halle Berry and her husband, Eric Benet instead. Don't bother seeing this flick. You'll really regret spending the ten spot.",1059868800,13,774,4.308219178082192
1925909,1,B0000DKDUT,"Who really cares about Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's Hollywood marriage, and how well they are working together on screen or if it works. Of course they're no Paul Newman and Joan Woodward. Who really cares how long their marriage last, and what will be said in US or People magazine For or I care Jennifer Lopez can have 9 divorces with in the next five years, so what.
 On with the movie, what is this movie supose to be about, any way. Is it a movie about two person, who falls in love, and how it came about, a mob movie, a romantic comendy along the lines like Sleepless In Seattle, Pretty Woman and What A Woman Wants or a Quentin Tarantino type wanabe. The answer is all the above, in my view, which it 100% does not work. If it wants to be a mob movie, it should have been a drama like the docudramas Donnie Brasco and Gotti. Who has ever heard of a female mob enforcer, which Jennifer Lopez is in the movie. In the history of the Mafia, there has never been one in Capone's, Gotti's or any other. If it was ment to be a romantic comendy it should have left the mob story line out, and only have it as Ben Affleck's character's background. If ie was surpose to be a Tarantino type movie, where is Tarantino, he's not the director or writer of the movie. The story of kidnapping the mentally retarded brother of a federal prosecutor, can work, if the movie made as a drama or if Tarantino is the writer and director, all else it fails big time. One to note, it is rare to see a mob movie that is also a comedy, and Analyze This and Analyze That is just that and it works with no problem, but not Gigli at all.",1059782400,2,1619,4.156050955414012
1925910,1,B0000DKDUT,"How bad is this? Think ""Glitter,"" ""Ishtar,"" ""Heaven's Gate,"" ""Showgirls,"" and ""Waterworld"" all rolled into one. This film is an incomprehensible mess, a lugubrious blend of bad acting, bad dialogue, and just plain bad characters. The plot (such as it is) concerns a hitman (Affleck, whose laughable Brooklyn accent is even worse when one considers his character is from L.A.) who falls for a lesbian yoga instructor (Lopez, just as bad). Somehow, Al Pacino makes an appearance (your official nadir, Al), and Christopher Walken shows up for a short while (his small role is the only thing worth watching in this mess). The dialogue is just awful, especially when the characters attempt to engage in sexual double-entendres (a sample, while a turkey--how ironic!--is being prepared: JLo: ""Gobble, gobble."") There's a plethora of foul language (I stopped counting the ""F"" word at around twenty-five, and the film was still relatively young), lots of stilted sexual content (the sex scenes involving the pair have zero chemistry and are uncomfortably voyeuristic); there's also a terrible segment in which JLo describes lesbian sex while doing yoga. I know Martin Brest is a capable--if not great--director (he helmed ""Scent of a Woman.""), but the way he tracks over JLo's body as she relates her experiences makes me think he came to this project straight from adult films. Despite all the sexual content, the film is desperately unerotic, probably due to the fact that we A: do not care about these characters, and B: they have absolutely no redeeming features. That's pretty much all you need to know, as further detail would simply be beating a dead horse. If you must see it, I have a couple of suggestions: Rather than waste seven to ten dollars on this turkey at the theatre (I was lucky enough to be offered a free pass if I would review it for another website), I suggest waiting for home video--but don't rent it immediately! Wait until it's in the ninety-nine cent section. Or better yet, wait for it to appear on cable. The less you spend to see this mess, the better!",1059696000,13,2076,4.900568181818182
1925911,2,B0000DKDUT,"Unlike other reviewers who apparently haven't ever met a Jennifer Lopez film they haven't liked, I profess to more than a little discomfort sitting through this monstrosity.  Let's just say it would probably be more entertaining and enjoyable to sit through a double feature of the Care Bears Movie and the Teddy Ruxpin Movie (1999) than this heap.  Why?  Acting, plot, chemistry.. shout out of anyone spots these, they do a great job hiding.  The only nominal performances go to Walken and Pacino, aptly chagrined at the display of their talents like guys who mistakenly wear tuxedos to a monster truck rally.  I've seen this film compared to 'Glitter' and 'Crossroads' and that's pretty accurate; it's an awkward derivative ego piece ironically showcasing all the wrong aspects of its purported stars.  Joanie and Chachi had more chemistry, and probably will have had longer staying power.  Here's hoping Hollywood's next reigning couple shows up sooner rather than later.",1059609600,27,974,5.165605095541402

Actually you should see this movie to see how bad a movie can get...

True, this is one of heck of a mess of a movie. The acting, characters, script, story are a total mess. However, it's NOT the worst film every made. There were some funny and clever moments, I am embarrassed to admit to laughing a few times. I rented this movie, I watched it in 4 different 30 minute segments. Breaking it up made it more easy to digest. I couldn't imagine doing it all in one viewing. It's so bizarre and quirky and goofy you can't just watch it in one sitting. It's only okay in limited doses. I recommend this movie to see just how cheesy and lame a film can be. It is cinematic gold to see such a bizarre and strangely done film that leaves you scratching your head wondering what they were thinking. It is quite boring by the way. Some of the dialogue is quit graphic and vulgar so be warned. It is fun seeing such A list actors in such a nonsense film. There is some nice footage of Southern California.",1461456000,,1016,4.205128205128205
