2311508,1,B0009PZ89E,A crappy copy of the movie with poor resolution and light. Couldn't get through 10 minutes without turning it off.,1394409600,2,114,4.75
2311509,1,B0009PZ89E,"From the packaging of the product I do not believe this his an authentic copy of the concert/movie Sign O the Times. I am very disappointed at myself for making such a quick purchase without doing my research first. When I got the DVD today, I immedately knew I was returning it. I looked through the other customers reviews as well. Had I looked at the other reviews first I would not have purchased this DVD. I have know idea of the quality or anything else about this product because I did not open the case.",1393286400,15,511,4.333333333333333
2311510,3,B0009PZ89E,The quality of this dvd was really dark and hard to see in some parts. I have this concert on video cassette and it's way better than this dvd.,1385337600,19,143,3.9655172413793105
2311511,1,B0009PZ89E,The dvd didn't work at all and it would have been too much hassle for me to send it back then wait to get my money back since I'm in a war zone. Never again,1360540800,,156,3.4857142857142858
2311512,5,B0009PZ89E,"To all my ""Prince"" lovers, this DVD is a must have. This DVD is a live concert / music video, very well produced with excellent picture and sound quality. It also includes Sheila E (in her prime) and ""Katt"" (you'll know her after this production)......It's the whole Sign of the Times album in video. You will not regret this buy.",1303257600,,330,4.516666666666667
2311513,5,B0009PZ89E,"Top of the line...a must have for sure for any Prince fan. And any music enthusiast must see it also. The coverage of the live perfomances is excellent. Prince really delivers an excellent job and makes me think of how AWESOME a live US tour would have been to promote his Sign O The Times ablum.  From Sign O The Times to Hot Thing, this vhs rocks!  The VHS quality is reminiscent of the vhs quality, but very clear to watch and alot of fun. Will keep you dancing!!!",1288224000,5,467,4.235955056179775
2311514,1,B0009PZ89E,"This is not an official DVD release.  It's a poor representation of one of the greatest concert films of all time, and is also a bootleg version of the film.  DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.  Amazon.ca sells the only REAL version of this DVD(released by Universal) and it is a must have.  But this?  This is a travesty beyond words and anyone who buys it is a fool.  It's literally flushing good money down the toilet.",1265760000,50,410,4.4

Prince was GREAT!!!!",1263254400,,228,4.725
2311530,5,B0009PZ89E,"""Sign O The Times"" is Prince at his very best. As others have stated, the video quality is fantastic, with the exception of ""You've Got The Look"" (because I think this is the most overrated Prince song ever, I happily skip over it - so the video quality doesn't bother me). If you're a Prince fan, get this DVD. Immediately after I watched it, I ordered one for my brother.",1521849600,,373,4.3428571428571425
2311531,5,B0009PZ89E,"Prince transcends time.

Part concert, part Broadway show, all of Prince in sign of the times. He's an entertainer pure and simple. Nonetheless, there is no one in music like him. He's an original showman. And this video strut his stuff, pure gold.

I remember seeing him in 1978. Then he wore black high heels and fishnet stockings. Nothing has changed: Prince transcends time.",1521504000,,378,4.890625

2311574,5,B0009PZ89E,"I've been looking for a copy of this forever, as it never made the repackage deal that happened w/ Purple Rain, Under the Cherry Moon and Graffiti Bridge.  One of the few ""complaints"" with Prince's album catalog is his lack of truly spectacular live material (which is bizarre in light of how incredible his performances were).  While there's a very loose plot around the clips, it's really a live testament of his European Sign O' The Times tour.  Worth your money for the ""It/Forever In My Life"" mash-up alone.",1498262400,,512,4.730337078651686

The visuals  and the audio quality of this disc are excellent. I had a copy of this on VHS from the nineties and knew that the lineup and the music were great. Upon Prince's death I began trying to find a digital release of this concert. Due to issues with copyrights and distribution, it was only available in Canada and for a very steep price.

2311620,5,B0009PZ89E,"Thirty years on and Prince's masterpiece is possibly more relevant today than at the Time of its creation. This new Blue Ray DolbyHD 5.1 ""concert film"" creates a cinematic portrait of the artist, his music, and the signs of our times. Lyrically this guy sees the future in his present. Musically here he is really beginning to stretch-out on his way to becoming The Artist of the next quarter century. On this newly rerendered video, he is captured (and cunningly packaged) as a talent without equals.

That we (his fans, the music community, and the public) lost this devout soul and  complex individual to elements of the opioid crisis thirty years in the making is an irony so bitter as to appear to be writ for a Greek tragedy. To those outside his exceptionally tight circle, he could seem to be a ""freak"". Yet, when confronted with ""hard partying"" it has been reported that he was a straight arrow, not adverse to gently chidding and admonishing anyone engaged with drugs. That his physical ailments would bring him into utilizing powerful narcotics, which in turn would make him the leading candidate for poster boy for accidental overdose is a sad reminder of the scourge of the Times.

Truly, we are lucky to have this document of Prince at a high point in his artistic powers. He is young, brash, talented, demanding,  provocative, daring, accomplished, athletic, funny, serious as a heart attack, and an artist adored by the audience he loves to entertain. The sadness of today's time is assuaged by the joy and happiness this video captures and allows us to access again and again. Do yourself a favor, buy this video, play it on the best system you can afford, and whenever possible, crank the volume to Earthquake levels. Maybe your neighbors, your kids, and your dear, old, aged parents will get into the Purple Genius' invitation to play in the sunshine.",1487203200,,1870,4.798136645962733

The audio isn't very good, it sounds as though they modified a mono mix for 5.1. It is listenable and enjoyable, but I had hoped for much more.
The visuals are good, but not great. As mentioned in previous reviews u got the look is the old video clip spliced into the show. It is quite poor quality, probably recorded on vhs.
Sign of the times is a fantastic album and so the music is great. There is a portion of little red corvette in there also.
I can see what Prince was trying to do with this ... That is, trying to make a concert/movie, rather than just a concert video. I like it (but especially now) would have loved a straight concert. One can only hope there is something in the vaults and it gets done properly. Hopefully, rave into the year 2000 can get a only say upgrade.

2311641,5,B0009PZ89E,"The Sign O the Times concert film showcases the Purple Yoda's musical prowess and incredible skills as a showman. There is a loose plot intended to link the whole thing as a ""story"", but it really takes a backseat to the performances. Prince's band at the time was cobbled together after the collapse of the Revolution, but they proved to be one of his strongest ensembles. The incredible drumming of Sheila E, the masterful horns by Eric Leeds and Matt Blistan, the skillful guitar work of Mico Weaver and bassist Levi Seacer Jr, the one-two punch on keyboards by Boni Boyer and former Revolutionary Matt ""The Doctor"" Fink...all of it backs up the amazing guitars and vocals of the main man himself! The choreography by Cat Glover is some of the best in the business at the time, and this was during a period when Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul were all active!

The songs themselves are primarily culled from the album of the same name. Widely considered by most Prince fans to be his best work, the songs all translate beautifully to a live setting. Tunes such as ""Hot Thing"" and ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"" are dripping with sensuality, while songs like ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" and ""It's Gonna Be a Beautiful Night"" raise the roof off. The concluding number, ""The Cross"" is just an amazing, emotional performance that is made all the more poignant with the passing of Prince in April of 2016.

The disc is a region-free one, so you needn't worry that this won't play on your Blu Ray player. The price is good, and the very fact that this saw release in Canada is a major win for US fans as well. The rights to this film are mired in red tape in the US, which is why it hasn't had an official home video release in the States since its initial debut on VHS! Getting a region-free release in Canada means that it is an affordable import for US fans.

The overall look of the print is superb overall. The exception is on ""U Got the Look"", mainly because Prince decided to edit the music video into the film. While the rest of the movie was shot on film, ""U Got the Look"" was shot on standard video tape. There is a noticeable shift in the quality, but it is fairly unavoidable. For me, this didn't detract enough to ruin the experience, so I'm not deducting anything here.

The disc sounds beautiful. I don't have a surround sound setup, but just hearing it from my speakers was amazing enough. I cannot wait to take it to a friend's house with a good system! This is Prince, so you want to hear the tunes as clearly as possible. The team working on this disc made sure that it sounded amazing.

Can't recommend this high enough. If you're a longtime fan, this is a crucial part of your collection! Personally, I find this to be his best film, even surpassing ""Purple Rain"" on the strength of the performances alone. If you are fairly new to Prince's music, then this flick is a great introduction to his body of work, and a chance to see him at the very peak of his skills as a musician and performer.",1484179200,3,3037,4.425760286225403

I was abit apprehensive on this purchase thinking that someone has probably just copied from dvd to blu ray, but was very surprised picture quality was awesome, not up to true blu ray standard but damn it was brilliant to see this concert in its true colours and the sound oh boy it kicks ass.
For me it would be very hard to pick a favourite but the stand out has got to be: I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man. Prince jams along forever he gets so caught up in the moment you know its not scripted.

2311730,5,B0009PZ89E,"Okay, it was, a long time ago, on VHS.  I've since found a Brazilian DVD of it that's so dark, it's practically unwatchable.  So this one was a real find!  I actually forgot how good this show was, although of course the experience has been enhanced considerably by the Blu-Ray presentation.  Seeing it in 16:9 aspect ratio, plus the sonic improvements inherent in this format made seeing this again a new experience for me.  This is a 1987 show in Rotterdam when he was touring his ""Sign O' The Times"" album, which IMO in its day was as good or better than his previous filmed project, ""Purple Rain"".  All of your favorites from this album aren't represented (""Adore"" is an almost unforgiveable omission), but he generally hits the high points.  ""It"" was relegated to a kind of call-and-response thing between the stage and the audience, following the excellent ""Forever In My Life"", but that was kind of a throw-away track anyway.  The only track not from SOTT is a rousing version of ""Little Red Corvette"" unless you count the jazz vamps performed by a cracking band (like ""Take The 'A' Train"") during Prince's multiple wardrobe changes.  I watched it with my wife, who wasn't very familiar with the album, and never saw the VHS, and her jaw dropped.  We can stipulate that Prince was a brilliant performer and songwriter, but to actually witness as close as we will ever come to a live performance (now...) this is as good as it will get until the Estate begins releasing from the Archives.  I can see how he injured himself!  Performing all of those splits and jumping fearlessly from risers were bound to take a physical toll at some point....  The only real caveats I have about this Blu-Ray are these: 1)  Although purported to be ""region-free"", it would not play in my Samsung Blu-Ray player, even though it played in my PS4 and Sanyo player just fine.  2). ""U Got The Look"", while not one of my favorites from the album in the first place, is not performed live.  It seems as though they inserted the MTV video, and it's in 480p, when the rest of the disc is in 1080p.  Not much of a letdown for me, but it was a hit record, so someone might care.  Otherwise, this is a truly excellent presentation and a reminder of the supreme gifts of a talented performer we took for granted and threw away in order to pursue lesser music.  RIP, Prince Rogers Nelson.",1473638400,59,2364,4.559241706161138

Comparing the Blu-ray picture to the original VHS, it's clear that slightly more picture information is available on the tape as it was presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (or thereabouts).  This widescreen release has been matted as I believe it was in the original theatrical showings.

This has nothing to do with the company selling them, this is all about how the DVD was originally released. However, it still looks great on my laptop.",1464220800,,563,4.222222222222222
