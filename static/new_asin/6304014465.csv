759513,5,6304014465,"Indiscretion takes place in one locale only, Rome's main train terminal.  It chronicles the final moments of an ill-fated tryst between an Italian man (Montgomery Clift) and an American housewife (Jennifer Jones).  But do not be fooled by the simplicity of this synopsis.  Indiscretion is a multi-layered, surrealist script which, by focusing on the love affair between two people, takes a very courageous, analytical look at the clockwork behind the man's actions and the realities and demands of the society which formulates and steers those actions.  In this story, it explains how this clockwork dictates and rules our lives, for better or worse.  This analyzation is non-judgemental, and thankfully so.
Heavily targeted here are religion (monks and clerics are always nearby, following scenes between the couple), mortality and the fleeting nature of life (sinister clocks tick away, leaving less and less time available to the lovers), social and political authority (the threatening and humiliating experience of being arrested by a foreign authority), the universal compassion of humanity (the sick passenger and the ripping up of the police charge), the  institution and sanctity of marriage (the pictures of the woman's child, her nephew representing and reminding her of the importance of the family), among many others.  They are presented here for one reason alone: to demonstrate the complexity of the human experience, and to quite brutally prove what type of influence the world around us has on making subjective decisions. The viewer, as a result, is apt to be asking themselves over and over, ""What is she going to do?  ... What is she going to do?""  Like the recent German film Run Lola Run, we see the power and significance that the ramifications subjective decision-making holds.
Indiscretion is rare piece of cinema in that it analyzes and exposes without making moralistic critiques.  How this film could have been made in the 1950s is something of a conundrum to me, though I imagine it has something to do with Truman Capote working on the script, Montgomery Clift's genius, and of course a very unique director!
To make this experience all the more interesting is the real-life drama which unfolded between the two lead actors in this film. In the film, Clift was the catalyst for the couple's love, desperately trying to turn the fate of his lover in his direction, ultimately failing.  Off-screen, it was Jones who tried to do so, ultimately failing due to Clift's sexual orientation.
This film is a gem.  If you're interested in films which unabashedly strip the human experience naked, this is for you.  If you're looking for an feel-good, life-affirming Hollywood script stay clear.",983059200,35,2715,5.157175398633258
759514,5,6304014465,"...THERE IS MORE HERE  TO BE STUDIED!!
Even with all the chaos that went on during the production, we have a fantastic, moody timepiece starkly, darkly noir. Yet it is lavish too - in terms of the overwhelming images, and Clift's luminous performance.  His real angst and tension spilled into Monty's portrayal here, and we have a sense of his explosive frustration right on the screen.
I highly recommend ""Indiscretion"" because no matter what, it WAS amazing filmmaking that Selznick could not wreck, even if he tried!  Amongst the fascinating Terminal Station background, with its surreal inhabitants & images; the tense Jennifer Jones  and translucent Montgomery Clift.  Jones' forays into pressure dealing with the guilt and suicide of ex-husband Robert Walker, and present husband, David Selznick, keeping her off balance; she was also pressured & it shows.  It seems a rare view to me of what Hollywood angst could do to a certain caliber of performer at times - baring their personas & intertwining it with what transpired on onscreen.
This is a fascinating classic of the genre even in its less than finalized state, and it shows Montgomery Clift in an exotic portrayal NOT to be missed.",976752000,2,1195,5.01010101010101
759515,1,6304014465,"In her biography of Montgomery Clift, Patricia Bosworth reports the many factors that made the production of this a strained affair. Director Vittoria De Sica was unable to speak english to either Clift or co-star  Jennifer Jones; he was being bombared with daily 40-50 page memos from  David O Selznick (Jones' husband and the producer); Jones' previous  husband, Robert Walker, had just committed suicide leaving her on edge; and  Clift suffered from insomnia and was drinking heavily. After De Sica had  completed production, Selznick re-edited the film (with an axe, it seems),  reducing 87 to 60 minutes, so that it focused more on the stars and less on  the extra's which De Sica had painstakingly choregraphed in the huge train  station where filming had taken place. (De Sica's cut was restored in  1983). What survives of De Sica's work with the extra's is the best part of  the film and a monument to crowd control. The love story is almost a  self-parody since both actors deliver self-conscious neurotic performances.  Jones is particularly bad, her face often falling into the grimaces that  mars her later work. The only believable moments are their embarassment at  being caught kissing in an empty carriage and arrested for a never-defined  crime. Why would Italians object to public kissing!  Selznick also missed  the fact that the police commissioner is a spitting image of himself, which  makes Jones being accused of infidelity ironic since he had begun an affair  with her while she was still married to Walker. The film also features West  Side Story's Richard Beymer as Jones' kid nephew.",964828800,8,1612,5.034090909090909
759516,4,6304014465,When I first saw this film I was captured by the grainy Black and white realism and surrealism of the cinematography.  I found myself disappearing in a past life somewhere in Italy in a train station and feeling like a fly  on the wall as these two people were going throughout the different changes  that emotions and time restraint love can cause.  I love this movie because  of that.  To me that is what a film should do.  Displace you.  Unfortunately as most will observe something is missing.  Namely part of  the film.  For some reason or another censors and others who felt the film  was too long.  Ridiculous as it is.  Made many cuts and have left us with  just a part of something that may have been great.  Some people criticize  Jennifer Jones as a bit too overacting but some people are very edgy in  moments of change and despair.  Montgomery Clift is so brilliant that it's  hard to not see the differences in acting styles between him and Jennifer  and that may make some think that there is no chemistry between the leads  but I don't agree.  Anyone who has researched about the making of this film  should know that Jennifer Jones was very much in love with Montgomery Clift  and completely devastated when she found out about his sexual orientation.  This only adds to the emotional background for the story and propels the  film even further in my opinion. Victorio De Sica did a masterful job in  directing everything from background players to the many other actors who  had little parts here and there to add color to the story.  One day maybe  we will see a restored version of this film and see Victorio's masterpiece  as it should have been presented.,950227200,5,1677,4.5608108108108105

Certain aspects of Vittorio de Sica's INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE, screaming soundtrack violins in particular, can be annoying. I tried to stay detached from this story of a Roman love affair doomed to end, but got swept up in Monty Clift's performance and his interactions with Jennifer Jones.

759655,5,6304014465,"Patti Page, who at the time of this movie's release was the No. 1 female singer in the country, was hired to film a special prologue that was shown in theaters along with the edited-down 64-minute version of ""Indiscretion of an American Wife,"" in order to fill out the program time.  It was a first-rate production, supervised by Selznick himself, directed by William Cameron Menzies and beautifully photographed by James Wong Howe.  Arranger Paul Weston and lyricist Sammy Cahn created two new songs based based on the Alessandro Cicognini background score, which became the ballads ""Autumn in Rome"" and ""Indiscretion,"" and Page sings them in a dramatic, moody setting, against a glowing high-rise Manhattan fireplace.  This short was considered so important at the time that it actually had its own one-sheet poster.

Jones meets Clift while on holiday there, and their hot, steamy romance begins. Jones, however, is married and torn between her uncontrollable, sexual desire for Clift that she vacillates between her life as a housewife in Philadelphia to wanting desperately to start a new life with Clift.

Emotions are all over the place, from Jones being slapped in the face by Clift, to them both being arrested for making out in an abandoned railroad car.

759827,4,6304014465,"In the dramatic wartime favourite ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), Jennifer Jones appeared in a train-station scene that quickly became one of the most memorable--and lampooned--in cinema history.  Nine years later, Jones starred in another picture which almost exclusively takes place in a bustling railroad terminal.  INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE, aka ""Stazione Termini"" (1953) is one of the most unusual and ambitious movies in Ms Jones' career.

Running just over an hour, the story follows the unravelling of a holiday fling between American housewife Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones) and a handsome half-Italian, Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift).  She wants to leave the affair and return to her husband and daughter back in the States as quickly as possible; Fate would have it otherwise.  Left to her own devices in Rome's Central Station until the train arrives, Mary is confronted by Giovanni...

I've probably given the story much less fanfare than it deserves.  This is very much a character/mood piece; with some exceptionally-written dialogue from Truman Capote.  Director Vittorio De Sica injects the film with a neo-realist touch and extracts some of Jennifer Jones' most unguarded and vivid screen work in the process.

It's another strange coincidence that both Jones and Clift had recently come from personal successes in screen versions of works from author Theodore Dreiser (she in 1952's ""Carrie"", he in 1951's ""A Place in the Sun"").  Whether De Sica cast them with this knowledge is not known, but they blend well with equally emotional performances.  Co-starring a teenaged Richard Beymer as Jones' concerned nephew, the film paints a compelling portrait of thwarted love.  Recommended.",1246406400,3,1708,5.379699248120301
759888,4,6304014465,"""Indiscretion of An American Wife"" is an imperfect romantic drama starring Jennifer Jones and Montgomery Clift.  It's completely overwrought, but also surprisingly stirring and ultimately haunting.  The final moments in which the lovers have to say a last goodbye to one another are unforgettable.  Whatever you think about what came before it (the sluggish, uneven plotting), you really get swept away by Clift's loss and his emotional and physical abandonment at the station as Jennifer Jones' train pulls away.  This Criterion version also provides the longer edit of the film, released as ""Terminal Station"".  It's perhaps more artistically substantial, but distracting to our interest in Clift and Jones.

759892,5,6304014465,"""Terminal Station"" was the result of a meeting of minds between two world famous filmmakers - Italy's Vittorio De Sica and U.S. mega-producer David O. Selznick. Their ideas of filmmaking were at opposite ends of the spectrum and the end result for the film was disastrous.
De Sica was one of Italy's pioneers of the ""neo-realism"" style of filmmaking which emphasized a gritty realism utilizing small budgets, hand-held cameras and actors with ""characteristic"" faces. David O. Selznick, on the other hand, was one of Hollywood's most successful producers who name was behind a roster of impressive films, notably ""Gone With The Wind."" His style was more reserved, romantic and ""high-gloss."" In 1942, Selznick had discovered a young girl from Tulsa, Oklahoma named Phylis Isley whom he groomed for stardom and changed her name to Jennifer Jones.
Jennifer Jones was a unique and talented actress who earned an Academy Award for her first major role in ""The Song of Bernadette."" She followed that film with an impressive list of roles that wisely emphasized her versatility and she avoided being type-cast. Indeed, only three years after winning the Oscar for her ""saintliness"" in ""Song of Bernadette,"" she shocked film goers with a brazen display of sensuality as a half-breed half caste girl in ""Duel In The Sun."" She earned Oscar nominations four years in a row in the mid 40s.
Selznick married Jones in 1949 and took on her career full time. For her, this proved to be more detrimental than helpful. Selznick was a control freak who tried to dictate every aspect concerning her appearance and choice of roles. Her best films would be done by other directors and producers who would wisely turn a deaf ear to Selznick's intrusions.
The De Sica/Selznick project began in 1952. ""Terminal Station"" was filmed entirely in Rome's sleek new railway station during late night hours and it didn't take long for De  Sica's style of realism to clash with Selznick's expectations for the film. Selznick insisted that another cinematographer be brought in to film Montgomery Clift and Jennifer's close-ups so that they would appear more ""glamorous."" After the film was completed, Selznick edited the 90 minute film down to 63 minutes for the U.S. release and retitled it ""Indiscretion of an American Wife.""
Both versions failed at the box office and with critics. The film looked wonderful and the camera-work was stunning, especially the close-ups of Jones and Clift. But the problem with the film basically lay in the story itself - there was not too much to it. The story is told in ""real time"" and is the farewell between a Philadelphia house-wife and her Italian lover. De Sica's additions of minor characters in the station (some for comic relief) did little to help the otherwise flat story. The acting by both leads, however, was superior and the chemistry between Jones and Clift is very steamy. Considering that the film was made in the early 50s, it is also quite frank and daring in subject matter.
Criterion has restored both versions of the film for the dvd and they have done a spectacular job. A commentary by Leonard Leff is very informative and covers everything from the colorful but troubled production history to interesting tidbits about Jones and Clift's acting styles and personal lives. A gallery of the film's ads and posters is included. This dvd would especially be helpful to film students who want to study the styles of two very different film-makers.",1061856000,23,3469,4.970740103270224

Criterion has just announced the release of INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE in its catalogue for August 2003. The studio will present both versions of the movie. So be patient and avoid the Roan Group DVD until then.

759895,5,6304014465,"I loved it. We always think of the 50's as being so pure and correct. Here we see people were just as prone to adultery as they are today. This movie shows how a torrid love affair can be filmed without taking off the clothes.  It is the story of an American housewife who has been visiting her sister in Italy and ends up having an affair with a college professor. They are insanely in love. She is at the train station preparing to leave for home.
Professor shows up. It is awkward because her innocent nephew is there to see her off.
In this train station we see uninhibited lust, the insanity of being in love, all of this against the backdrop of the daily activities in the train station. I was breathless, glued to the set!!!
This type of story is some much more difficult to tell without the torrid bedroom scenes, but sooooo erotic.
Montgomery Cliff as the Professor could not pull of the Italian bit. He did not look it, nor sound it. He was thin, rackish, the last actor I would have expected to be cast in such a role. But he did an excellent job. He was moody, explosive, begging, sobbing, demanding. I didn't know he had it in him.
I enjoyed it throughly.
I wish we could see more films like this today. Love and lust with artistry. It takes nothing to make this work with full body contact between unclothed actors. This took real directing and acting talent.",1002931200,15,1373,4.36328125
759896,4,6304014465,"The running time on this film is only 63 minutes which is really quite enough time considering that it is basically plotless and is mainly a one hour farewell between an American housewife and an Italian man she is having an affair with. You will really not notice the plot weaknesses, however, because of the intense performances from the stars and the wide array of emotions this film brings forth. Jennifer Jones, although really too sophisticated and regal for a Philadelphia housewife, is quite good here and gives the best performance in the film. An early scene where she sits in the train caressing a dress that she has just bought for her daughter is simply a marvel - we can read everything in her face and we can easily see how her thoughts drift from her daughter to her lover. Montgomery Clift is gorgeous beyond belief here (this was a few years before the devastating car accident which scarred his face) and his acting is okay except he starts out with an Italian accent which totally disappears halfway into the film. The film was photographed at Rome's new (at the time) Terminal Station and was filmed at night to avoid crowds and day to day business in the immense station. Jennifer Jones' smart suit was designed by Christian Dior, who had just appeared on the fashion scene. The Roan Group dvd is excellent and presents a sharp image that is free of nicks and scratches. Some added features would have been nice but all we get here is a cast and crew summary and a brief page about the making of the film.",995155200,10,1527,4.576642335766423
759897,3,6304014465,"It is always interesting to see the awesomely beautiful Jennifer Jones and I waited keenly to see the NTSC format video (as a PAL format was not available in the U.K.) which can be played on my VCR.Oh but what a hullabaloo about nothing! What was the indisretion?The Italians, of all people, dragging two innocent people out of a railway car up before the ""beak"", who as far as is shown on film, were not doing anything untoward! The whole film could have been cut in half for the paucity of action and dialogue. How could anyone cast Montgomery Clift as a native Italian. Were there not some American/Italian actors sufficiently known in 1952(a latter day Al Pacino) who could have been cast by Selznik and at least spoken some authentic Italian to his countrymen? The highlight was seeing ""Tony"", Richard Beymer from the 1960 film West Side Story, playing a little boy and cast as ""Dick Beymer""!",994809600,3,897,4.6835443037974684

7859093,5,6304014465,"Poor Montgomery Clift is so in love with Jennifer Jones in this movie portrayal of two-crossed lovers, that he doesn't know if he's coming or going. It's a beautifully done black-and-white film with classical 50's music, and all the scenes take place in a Rome train station. Jones meets Clift while on holiday there, and their hot, steamy romance begins. Jones, however, is married and torn between her uncontrollable, sexual desire for Clift that she vacillates between her life as a housewife in Philadelphia to wanting desperately to start a new life with Clift.

Emotions are all over the place, from Jones being slapped in the face by Clift, to them both being arrested for making out in an abandoned railroad car. Really unbelievable sensual sparks fly between these two lovers. And all the while, Clift dreams of taking his new job at the University of Pisa, living on the waterfront in a cozy villa with Jones. She is so torn between her desire for him and knowing she must return to her husband and child - you don't know whether to urge her on, or make the decision for her to do the moral thing and go back to her husband.

Brilliantly done film with two outstanding actors of the time. This film really involves you emotionally and you feel for both characters. Does she leave the young, sexy Clift to go back to her older, probably boring husband, or will she stay with Clift and let the sexual tension turn into a blaze between them? Watch it for yourself and see how this romantic dilemma is resolved.

A really must watch - sexy, sensual 50's film. The passionate kisses leave you wondering what comes next......",1473206400,,1629,4.668989547038327

The intensity in the middle of a crowded place is reminiscent of Hitchcock.
