8123751,4,B000FJH4ZA,"I watched this Anime and just loved it. A unique story line about a young adult who is having a lot of bad luck. One day a fortune teller told him he'll have good luck, so a bunch of guardian angels who were reincarnated pets took care of him and help him out.

The reason why I gave this a 4 star is because there is so much more they could have added. It seems choppy and quick.",1370304000,2,380,3.871794871794872
8123752,2,B000FJH4ZA,"Yes i gave this series 2 stars. why for a number of reasons, one being that I perconally didn't really like the seires.

Where to begin well i picked the series up because it sounded like it could be funny. Mean pets turned into guardian angels then sent back to help your typical loser. Yes a different varient to your typical harem anime but outside of tones of girls in love with the main character is where the simularities with the rest of its genre ends. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you took all the riska jokes, the fan fair, the touching moments, the series romance out of a harem anime and made for teenaged girls, well you just stepped in the steaming pile of it.

Yes you heard me this Harem anime is designed for teenaged girls, it made more like a shojo then anything.

To the real review the first and largest problem with the series is that the cast is just plain too big for a thirteen episode series to pull off. Mean it juggles the twevel angles, the guy, three bad guys, a goddess and an xgirlfriend forcing it to skip from one charcter to another without giving any of the characters to develope past the basic sketch making it near impossible to really like any of the characters. Then there is the little thing that though it tries desperately very few of its jokes are actually funny. The music is too sweet and i really didn't like it. the voice acting was rather flat and uninspired. The animation was okay but the only character that came off as being attractive was the goddess and Yuki the snake. The plot is a mess two thirds ofthe series is intorductions with no real closure given in the end. Don't get me wrong this series is fine it's just slightly below average. The thing about it that turns me off is it's supposed to be a harem anime and there aren't even next to none of the women are atractive.

All in all rent this one if your interested, if not then don't it's kindofa waste of time but under no circumstances buy this series.",1172534400,2,1984,4.354054054054054
