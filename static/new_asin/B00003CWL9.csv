1269392,5,B00003CWL9,"I would love to see this DVD, when and if it is ever released. This movie is about Alan Freed and the people around him in New York City in the mid-1950's. It captures the flavor of the era by carrying Alan Freed's true personal story line (playing R&B on white stations, giving unknowns a chance, promoting mixed-race music shows, fighting the censors, and staying true to the music), and carrying the story of the times through composite characters.

We have: the aspiring song writer (Laraine Newman), the talented doo-wop group who gets a break (the Chesterfields), the girl-groups and boy-groups who come from the streets to be stars, the 50's wise-guy/woman-chaser/driver/bodyguard (Jay Leno), the gum-chewing secretary (Fran Drescher), the agents and their rising stars, the young fans (Moochie Dryer), the DJ's, the record producers, the song hustlers, the musicians, the guy beating on the trash can, and many others.

The movie features at least 4 R&R legends playing themselves: Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Frankie Ford, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins (the last two go by quickly). Tim McIntire doesn't look much like Alan Freed, but McIntire captures the character of Freed very well.

1269489,4,B00003CWL9,"This ""loosely told"" biopic of Alan Freed does not go through the chronological events of his life, but instead focuses on a few days in 1959.  As a bit of a music geek, I was slightly annoyed at the factual inaccuracies in this movie, which include classic songs being hits during the wrong years, performed by the wrong bands, written by people who didn't write them, and/or shown being produced in ways that they weren't in reality.  There is a young female songwriter living with her parents who's supposed to be Carole King I guess, but by the time Carole was the age of the girl in the film, she was way further along with her career and life.  Plus, the film suggests she wrote the classics ""Since I Don't Have You"" and ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love?"", songs which had nothing to do with King or any other female songwriter and were written by two completely different people.  Freed is played by Tim McEntire, a decent actor with a good ""radio voice,"" but McEntire's also a balding chubby who looks more like Bill Haley of Comets fame than like the skinny, brooding Freed.  And the plot seems to make way too much out of whether the Brooklyn Paramount is going to allow a rock n' roll show to go on. In reality, Freed was putting on rock n' roll shows regularly by 1959 - a far cry from 1952 when the fire department actually did shut down his ""Moondog Coronation Ball"" in Cleveland fearing that a riot was going to break out.  I believe Freed did have some issues with the Brooklyn Paramount objecting to a show in 1959, but he simply moved the whole shebang to another venue nearby. His career did not end abruptly in one big ruckus as the movie suggests, and the issues leading to his downfall - payola, IRS harassment and drinking mostly - took years to come to a head, not a single night, week or even months. Basically it seems like whoever wrote this tried to shove every major issue of Freed's life into a week's time span in order to make a movie.

Having said that, this movie is still pretty enjoyable in terms of capturing, fairly accurately, the kind of excitement, hucksterism, and youth-vs.-adults mentality that rock n' roll had at the time.  It's not quite as good as ""American Graffiti"" but it's good enough and enjoyable enough.  Some of the storylines seem a little Hollywood cliched - the white girl who gets involved with a black doo-wop band to the chagrin of her parents, and a very young Fran Drescher and Jay Leno playing two bickering young New Yorkers who mix like oil and water and thus are bound to fall in love.  However, maybe when this movie was made back in 1978, those concepts hadn't yet been done to death by a host of other 50's nostalgia movies.  And in any event, the soundtrack is good.

So watch it if you want to see a good movie about radio and music promotion in the late 50's.  I just kind of wish, since they took such liberties, they had just gone ahead and made the protagonist fictional or a composite as well, rather than this supposedly being the biography of Alan Freed.",1382659200,,3027,4.4422382671480145
1269490,4,B00003CWL9,"Perhaps this movie was meant to be remembered as ""hard to get""/'cult' rather than for it's pure entertainment value? I remember friends from that era having told me the movie was rather stylized, but it so captured the feeling for how things were back then. I-too-was surprised at the fact that there were many who did not want ""rock and roll"" to succeed.

  Anyway, one of my favorite parts to this movie was the portrayal of a very young and talented teenager-Carol King-and her supposed beginnings in the industry. It is fascinating to see how many truly talented people were vying for a chance to see there work on a 45 or 33 disk?

  The use of Allen Freed as a center piece for the brunt of the film does create a lot of movement, tension and helps keep a focus on the early birth of a new culture. The way they brought him down remains rather uncomfortable considering how long payola/graft/corruption has been around in most fields. It seemed the establishment really blamed him as a major representative of/for rock and thought they could kill it by getting rid of him? That point was nicely matched against one little boy asking him if rock and roll will die? And it was a nice lead in to the Dell Vikings-the first integrated group in rock music-perhaps another reason the establishment hated it(?).

  In the end, excitement and pure energy level provided by this film simply carries you from one scene through another as if you were suddenly reliving it! Is it completely true to life? Probably not. But who cares? Seeing an ageless Chuck Berry or Bill Haley and his Comets amidst some very entertaining performances by others is far more than this film needed. If-like me-you weren't alive/there for the original Allen Freed Rock and Roll Reviews, this is your chance to relive them at full glory! I last owned this film on Laser Disk and now wish I'd kept that gaudy machine-just for the movies that never got transferred over to DVD?",1375142400,,1949,4.642441860465116
1269491,3,B00003CWL9,"""American Hot Wax"" is a very good film, with the late Tim McIntire's performance as Alan Freed, and the recreation of his holiday rock 'n' roll shows at the Brooklyn Paramount. But Freed was no saint, no martyr, of rock 'n' roll. Growing up on the South Shore of Long Island in the 1950's, I attended many of Freed's rock 'n' roll shows. Incredible experiences! Great memories! Rock 'n' Roll; R&B; Rockabilly; Do Wop. All the genres that contributed to the creation of rock 'n' roll in the 1950's. The performers, memories of whom still linger in my aging psyche are...Little Richard,  Jerry Lee Lewis and Bo Diddley.

Alan Freed started his career in Cleveland (that's the primary reason why the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is located there), where, it is said, Freed coined the term ""rock 'n' roll"" to describe the musical genre emerging out of R&B. Moving to NYC, and first calling himself Moondog (until forced to stop by a NYC street poet that had been using that handle before Freed came to the Big Apple), Alan Freed became the king of rock 'n' roll radio in NYC, under his own name on WINS-AM, 1010 on your radio dial. Then he got his own daily late afternoon TV teen dance show, broadcast in the greater NYC area.

But, by this time, Alan Freed was corrupt. Deeply enmeshed in the graft and corruption of payola, which Freed was taking as a requirement for playing a new record on his radio show. He also made some artists, primarily young African-American singers and groups, put his name on some of their songs as co-songwriter, so he could get a piece of the songwriting royalties. And/or sign their publishing rights over to Freed, another lucrative source of income.

Alan Freed was brought down by the payola investigation, and lost everything. Disgraced, he eventually moved to Palm Springs, where alcoholism was a factor in his death. But I can still see Alan Freed on stage at the Brooklyn Paramount, wearing his trademark loud plaid sports coat, and introducing the next act.

Mister Rock 'n' Roll...indeed!",1374969600,5,2025,4.709039548022599
1269492,5,B00003CWL9,No need to rehash what an excellent film this is.  My feeling is the issue with it never appearing on DVD is similar to why WKRP in Cincinnati has never appeared on DVD (with the original music).  In either case the manufacturer would have to acquire the rights to all the music used in the show or movie.  It is a shame...  American Hot Wax gives such a good feeling of what things were like back in the late 1950s.,1371859200,2,416,4.1625
1269493,5,B00003CWL9,"I happened to catch this in a theatre during its limited release in the late 70's early 80's.  Loosely based on the life of Allan Freed, more than any other film I have seen about the early days of rock and roll this one captures the exhuberance of what those early days must have been like.

What is so interesting about this film is although it has some great characters, including performances by Frankie Ford, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis among others, it is not a character-driven film as much as it is a MUSIC-driven film.  The latter is likely why it's never been out in wide release (I still have a CED copy and I see a vhs copy offered up here from time to time).  There SO MANY are full and partial cuts of songs, it likely is just cost-prohibitive to try to get clearance for a commercial dvd copy to get produced(come on, Sir Paul, at least give us Buddy Holly).

The other thing this film illustrates is how the ""forces of evil"" tried to stomp out rock and roll and those who offered it up to the nation's teenagers.  One of the main casualties of this strategy was Mr. Rock and Roll himself, Allan Freed.  The personal and professional cost to him is touched up here.  Would rock and roll have erupted without him?  Probably, but rock and roll had no more ardent supporter than he.  He really loved this music he played and he was passionate about it and his audience.  That passion cost him just about everything.

Tim McIntyre's portrayal of him in this film is just genius.

On my first visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I turned a corner in an exhibit hall and there behind glass was an urn containing Allan Freed's ashes.  It brought tears to my eyes to see him FINALLY honored for the contribution (and sacrifice) he made for music he loved so much:  rock and roll.

1269555,3,B00003CWL9,"American Hot Wax by director Floyd Mutrux tells the story Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed and the birth of rock and roll. The film has never officially released on DVD but is widely available in several bootleg editions. Like Song of the South this was a film that I have always wanted to see. The film was a popular midnight movie in the early eighties before fading into total obscurity.

American Hot Wax celebrates the last few days of Brooklyn disc jockey Alan Freed's reign as the king of rock'n'roll and the onset of his martyrdom as r&r's patron saint. It boasts a solid stellar performance by Tim McIntire , and if he doesn't manage to save the film, he gives it a much-needed center of gravity. More than that, he strikes such a satisfying behavioral tone that, like the platter-playing disc jockey himself, he tends to validate the enthusiasm for the music he sponsors and win our indulgence of his co-players' excesses and director Floyd Mutrux's miscalculations. The film boasts decent performances all around an the iconic concert footage that makes up the last third of the film is a joy to watch.

While the birth of rock and its father's story may or may not have followed the storyline exactly as portrayed in the film; as Mick Jagger would later say ""it's only rock and roll but I like it."" The disc is another matter completely, the film looks to be a bootleg from a very bad bootleg VHS copy. While the picture is watchable the sound is the worst problem here. Its muddy and muffled. There is no way that this disc can be recommened at the price charged. This is a shame because its not likely that the film, which deserves to be seen will ever be released to to rights management issues on the many songs included in its soundtrack.

1269556,4,B00003CWL9,"I love this movie, one of my all-time favorite rock & roll movies. This is just a guess but I suspect the reason this movie is not out on DVD is the cost to the rights to the music used in the film are way too high for the studio that owns it to pay for those rights and to make a profit releasing it on dvd.

Musical usage right were much less expensive 25/30 years ago then they are now. The original rights to the music may have been negotiated for film release, broadcast and VHS rights but since dvd's did not exist back then it may now be impossible for everyone involved to agree on a fair price for the rights.

Jay Leno and Fran Drescher are both wonderful, and Tim McIntire as Alan Freed gives an honest presentation of the man himself.....(may I say the photo at the end of the flick is Alan at WINS 1010 in NY, where we old timers remember him best)

This is a wonderful film about a white guy who took black music and made it colorless and fully American; who paid the price with those who didn't want white girls dancing to that black music.......Alan Freed's success with demonstrating that the music had NO COLOR and was just purely American is what made him as much an American Hero as anyone else who fought the racial wars of the 50's, he just did it with music.....

He got tagged and harassed for ""Payola"", (that is taking money and gifts from record companies through their promotion men in exchange for playing their records, at a time when everyone was doing it; not like today where we do the exact same thing in more sophisticated ways) the real reason Alan went down was because he was seen as the leader of a racial threat the powers that be felt in what he was doing. And he was spreading out to films and stage shows; he was becoming very visible and reminiscent of the wonderful line in Easy Rider, you know, about people talking about freedom is one thing, when they see it happening, it scares them and they get dangerous....Alan was seen as the guy opening the door to America's black music artists in the ""controlled"" south and bringing it right into New York City and America.....he was safe in Ohio, but way to threatening in NYC....this music might catch on......

Sure he was a character, he was everything you'd expect from a show business super star and more, but his heart was true, his dedication to the kids he played the music for was absolute, and he is still remembered long after the things he fought for were accomplished......

And in the end, 65 years later, Alan's spirit has the satisfaction on knowing he won.",1329436800,2,2055,4.472

Original review:

Hello fellow fans of this film who are frustrated with our lack of ability to see it, buy a DVD, and so-on.  I am not writing a proper review, but am posting this ""heads-up"" in the review area because I'm not quite sure where else to put it.  I wanted to point out that I noticed today there are some ""tagging"" areas here at Amazon.com where we can apparently add this and other films to lists where we think they should be brought out on DVD.  So, for example, I added this and another film to the tagging lists ""DVD Please"", ""Ought to be on DVD"" and so on:
[...]

I also added my email to the list to be notified when a DVD is brought out.  I guess the tagging feature for ought-to-be-on-DVD type of tag is not exactly new, since there are plenty of films with a dozen or more such tags, but it seems to be new to me and new to this film here on Amazon.com, as I didn't see those tags yet.  So, I think it's a good thing for us, that we have an additional outlet now by which to keep track of and express our enthusiasm for this film being made available for viewing.

I wonder if Jay Leno is now retired from his main job if he might take an interest in helping this film get to publication again?

Anyway, sorry for the non-standard use of the review area to discuss these matters, but I didn't know where else to discuss the information so it would eventually reach the other fans of getting this onto DVD.

I wonder if this tagging feature will make any difference, at all, or if we'll just keep asking to be allowed to buy movies and if the movie industry will just keep telling us to wait and that there is not enough demand or that they can't get it together on certain films or who-knows-what.

2011-03-19: addendum.  Changed Stars from 4 to 5.  I'm working from 15-25 years of memory, and some supposedly-profit-motivated incompetent or complacent geniuses in the film industry either

- can't be bothered to overcome hurdles to get this movie out until the musicians, actors and motivated viewers are all dead,

or

- can't be bothered to get the word out as to what is really holding up the release.

So, what the heck, I'll choose to remember the best parts in the best light.",1244332800,2,2508,4.311965811965812

Freed was a source of great controversy:
criticized by conservatives for corrupting youth
with the ""devil's music""; hated by racists for promoting

persecuted by law enforcement officials
and finally brought down by the ""payola"" scandals.

Rock and Roll Revue at the Brooklyn Paramount which climaxes the film is right on the money...............

There are good supporting performances by Jay Leno (looking more shovel-chinned than ever), Fran Drescher, and Lorraine Newman (playing a role loosely based on Carole King)....also included are great cameo performances by Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis,  Kenny Vance and company (as the Planetones), and let's not forget the 'Chesterfields' the greatest fictional doo wop group of all time.

I found a bootleg DVD from a small company on line, but it's essentially a mediocre copy pressed on disc..........the fact that Paramount Home Video hasn't seen fit to issue a commercial release is criminal...

C'mon Paramount--suck it up--pay the clearance rights to the music and arists and get it out already---with loads of special features.......

A reissue of the soundtrack on CD wouldn't hurt either...............

Note--for those who want the real Alan Freed story set against the canvas of the early days of rock and roll radio, I suggest John Jackson's sensational book ""Big Beat Heat"" which should still be available from Amazon.......................",1196726400,6,2096,5.180473372781065
1269626,4,B00003CWL9,"It boggles the mind how some of the worst crap ever produced on film is on DVD, but ""American Hot Wax"" is still not available.
Although this is not a cinematic gem, it does capture the energy around the rock scene of the 50's. Having been a teenager in New York during that period, I vividly recall Alan Freed's radio & TV shows. He was in the right place at the right time, and quickly found himself in the wrong place once payola surfaced.
Looking back, one can now see how Freed ""forced"" certain songs on his listeners.
Meanwhile, the music in the movie is great (although somewhat anacronistic regarding the actual release dates of the songs). Look for a young Arnold McCollough (James Taylor's primary back-up volcalist) as a member of one of the doo wop groups.
Freed was a real-life cartoon character. This movie succeeds is showing viewers how the infancy of rock 'n roll evolved. Freed played a huge role in it's foundation.
The only real knock on the movie is the somewhat serious and indifferent demeanor portrayed by Tim McIntire. Freed was much more gregarious and personable in real life.

This movie makes you experience the same feeling each one (who liked it) must of felt the first time they heard Rock-n-Roll.....this was the first sound of it by a Radio DJ Alan Freed, who later showed America, in live performances.

  If you ever felt thrills from movies such as ""Grease"", ""Sound of Music"", or even the new ""Hairspray"" movie, you will feel the thrill from this one I gaurantee you will, although it's also history in the making. The movie also shows one young girl whose parents don't understand her love of this music, but she wrote a song that became popular, and sat down and sang it at the piano softly for her parents and you could see they finally could see.

Since this dude by pure entrepreneurial wholehearted genius, as a concert producer, marketed this music to the whole country almost all by himself. Beating those multi-millionaires impresarios that copied him by over one and half decades.

Unfortunately he died in disgrace pennieless due to the fact that it was the early 1950th decade, this music was then considered revolutinary as well as very anti American. Alan Freed paid dearly for promoting it, but we also think that he was discriminated due to his jewish background. However can't botch for sure about the last.

Anyway this film tell us the story of this poque and of this concert and radio promoter. The movie was released by Paramount Picture during the period that this studio was owned by ""Gulf and Western Ltd."" When Paramount was run I think by Barry Diller and Michael Dammann Eisner.

Hopefully the new owners ""Viacom"" should released it sooner fully restored in anamorphic widesceen DVD, not only due to the fact that this motion picture covers very important times and events, but because its great screenplay and specially fabulous ""Rock & Roll Music.""",1124496000,15,1377,4.846808510638298

Check out Kenny Vance & the Planotones doing ""Come Go With Me"", and ""The Chesterfields"", with James Taylor backup vocalist Arnold McCullers doing Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers! Let's not leave out two of the fathers of Rock & Roll...Chuck Berry & Jerry Lee Lewis in all their glory!

Portraying one week in the life of Alan Freed as he attempts to put on a First Anniversary Concert at the Brooklyn Paramount and gets hassled and harrassed by city officials and record companies alike,the movie recreates the delightful music of the times, including memorable performances by Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

The late Tim McIntire gives a stellar performance as Alan Freed,the best portrayal I've seen yet.

Both the actors, the actual performers (Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Screamin Jay, etc.), and the film's teen audience seems to enjoy what they're doing and the enjoyment is contagious. The live stage show at the Paramount is even more fun to watch than some actual rock concert films! This appears to really capture the spirit of the times.

7917481,3,B00003CWL9,"First of all, good luck finding a copy of this movie. If you do get to see it, congratulations! Secondly, Im going against the grain with most of the reviews. I enjoyed this film but I didn't think it was all that.

For my taste, I couldn't get into the approach of the movie. Theres no plot, per se, more like a day in the life with scenes that seemed improvised and off the cuff. The movie features Jay Leno  which from his perspective, is probably in his element  being himself and seems to be riffing through the whole movie. Fran Drescher is well cast as his girlfriend, and together they do have chemistry.

Other reviews have praised Tim McIntires portrayal of Alan Freed. I don't see it. Look at footage of Freed and then watch McIntire; he just didn't seem kinetic enough, let alone resemble Freed (McIntire would go on to portray George Jones in the Tammy Wynette bio-pic!).

The biggest attraction of this movie is the music and the abundance of great classic rock and roll. There are appearances by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, which in my opinion have never gotten their due in, and on, film. Related, the recreated concert scenes are well done. The movie does a good job of recreating the vibe of early/mid 1950s and the emergence of rock and roll  of which, no doubt, Alan Freed had a paramount role.

7917488,5,B00003CWL9,"This is the best film no one has ever seen.

American Hot Wax strikes me as a great idea fully realized. It's a travesty that it is unavailable to purchase and largely forgotten.

What a thrilling, frightening time it must've been for Alan Freed leaving Cleveland for New York in the mid 50's just as rock & roll was taking off. This film captures the insane magic of it all. Drama, poignancy, hilarity, romance, racism...and the music, from all angles.

Great supporting cast of then relative unknowns. Jeff Altman, Moosie Drier, Laraine Newman are all solid. Fran Drescher and a young Jay Leno are a match made in heaven (or hell, depending on one's perspective) as Freed's secretary and chauffeur.

As solid as the supporting players are, this is Tim McIntyre's tour de force. In a just world he wins the best actor award in a runaway for his portrayal of the man who brought rock & roll to the white kids.

A highly underrated actor that we lost too soon, McIntyre captures Alan Freed in a manner so profound that I can't think of anyone since who has so inhabited an iconic figure so convincingly. The superb skill he displays in supporting roles in The Choirboys, Brubaker and others comes to full fruition here. He captures all sides, all subtleties of a troubled yet honorable man caught up in the whirlwind that was rock & roll in 1955.

But for Freed and for us, from beginning to end it's all about the music. Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis turn in classic performances not to be missed, but for me even more delicious are the studio, office and street corner scenes featuring the music.

If you have any interest in the history of rock & roll, particularly the early days, you MUST see American Hot Wax. It is easily one of the top music films of all time.

At this time American Hot Wax is available for viewing on Amazon Prime. Otherwise it appears to be out of print, though bootleg copies seem to be available.",1454284800,4,1927,4.53314121037464
