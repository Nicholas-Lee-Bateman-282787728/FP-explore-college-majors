8613678,4,B00FA7ETFK,This documentary follows three Broadway standbys and shows the hard work and the pitfalls of the job.  An interesting insight into an aspect of Broadway that deserves some attention.,1522108800,,182,5.275862068965517
8613679,5,B00FA7ETFK,"What a fantastic documentary of life on Broadway as a standby.  I can see why this would be incredibly useful for every future actor to watch!  I'm so glad my daughter who dreams of a life on Broadway had the chance to see this, and to get a sense of the challenges that lie ahead (and even for successful actors on Broadway like those here!).  Amazingly, the film appealed to our whole family, from my eleven year old with no interest in the subject to my seventy five year old mother-in-law!  Enjoy.",1468022400,,501,4.413043478260869
8613680,5,B00FA7ETFK,I attended a showing of this documentary last night and feel it is a must-see for anyone planning to pursue a career in the theatre.,1406160000,,132,4.32
8613681,5,B00FA7ETFK,What these actors go through on a daily basis is unreal. I had no idea how hard it was for them. To have your hopes and dreams rise and fall on a daily basis is torture. Only the truly devoted stick with it. Bravo to all of them.,1402358400,,229,3.7916666666666665
8613682,2,B00FA7ETFK,"I really thought there would be more to this. While I got a feel for the struggles of these talented actors (and even welled up a few times), I didn't think the documentary was that well made to begin with. It felt a little cut and paste which miniminalized their stories. Interesting/emotional moments were presented in a somewhat boring way and just came up short. I didn't finish it feeling very inspired, even with the ""where are they now"" blurbs at the end. It was also strange how they wrote ""So-and-so never went back to being a standby or swing again"". Perhaps it should've said that at press time they hadn't gone back, since their careers are still going. Wait to purchase this used. At only one hour and fifteen minutes it's just not worth the full price.",1401494400,2,766,4.557971014492754
