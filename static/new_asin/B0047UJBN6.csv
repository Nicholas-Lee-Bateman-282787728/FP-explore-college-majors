4285465,1,B0047UJBN6,"Slow, confusing, pointless and not a degree of suspense. Take the beautiful Charisma Carpenter (who you won't see naked and will barely see in suggestive clothes--so those who expect more needn't rent) and put her in a slow moving movie that takes forever to develop while somehow leaving gaping holes and confusing scenes. Throw in strobe like flash backs to a pathetic mass murder that consumes the first 15 minutes of the film, some creepy pointless locals, an empty house and you got the idea. You're also subjected to foul language, some terrible slasher gore, a man's nearly erect fully visible hilbilly's doinker swinging in the wind, several naked men's butts, one or two naked women's butts, a brief glimpse of nip on an ugly hooker, a bizarre and unerotic sex party and you can see how this movie goes no where and entertains no one. The only horror in this movie is the script. It seems that the director thought the more confused you were the better job he'd done. It's a mess. Somehow Charisma acts her way above the rest of the rubble, but it's a train wreck and not worth even a glimpse in this direction.",1298246400,14,1120,4.633165829145729
4285466,3,B0047UJBN6,"Well, if you are looking for a horror-type film that is a break from the traditional film of this nature, look no further than this one. Charisma Carpenter plays a writer who has moved to a secluded house in the woods after suffering a mental breakdown. After arriving there, she begins to have visions of a mass murder that occurred in that area fifteen years earlier. Aside from Carpenter, the cast is not very well known, and the performances are not that good. Also, the film drags a bit as it tries to go too noir, opting for long pauses with no music or no action. But it ends up being one heck of a good story, and there is a decent bit of gore for the horror lovers. There is some suspense, too, for those who love a good mystery. One note of caution: if you are offended by a large amount of gratuitous sex/nudity, then this might not be the film for you, because it occurs all throughout the film, even at unexpected places.",1296518400,12,934,4.3125

4285469,5,B0047UJBN6,In this movie Charisma Carpenter and her husband live different lives.  Her husband hires people to scare his wife to the point she goes crazy and murders a man.  Then the husband goes on with his own business which is an adult club.  This was the other business he never mentioned to his wife.,1430265600,,294,4.407407407407407

Could have been so much better with the caliber of actors involved.  The ghosts were under done even for the plot that writers chose.",1383350400,,261,4.395833333333333

4285475,1,B0047UJBN6,"Low budget British film with an all English cast except Charisma Carpenter..  This could have been so much more..  with a script written beyond an elementary school level.  My biggest regret is that they did not come even close to bringing out that Charisma Carpenter is capable of being attractive  by almost any standard.. In fact it is arguably her stock in trade signature. Not so in this film. This has got to be one of the worst examples of cinematography I have seen.
I used to think that soft core porn was poorly written,  the simulated sex scenes in this movie ( and the photography )are a step down from even that standard.  They couldn't even get it right on the cover art.
  I would hope that the script writers, director and producers would have learned from this effort.",1354752000,,785,4.557142857142857
4285476,2,B0047UJBN6,"I am a huge fan of Charisma Carpenter, ever since I saw her on Buffy. I haven't seen her do much since Angel finished. I enjoy horror movies, even the bad ones. Some of the reviewers here list the movie as having gratuitous nudity. There are a couple of semi-quick scenes, but I was expecting much more based off of the reviews. The acting isn't great by any means. I wish I had rented this instead of buying this (i got the Instant Video version for my Kindle). I tend to buy movies instead of renting, due to having a toddler running around, I don't want to spend $4 for a 3 day rental and then not being able to finish it. The production values are about what you expect for a direct to video film. I won't post any spoilers here. As i said, I often enjoy bad horror films that others do not, but this wasn't worth the hour and a half, even if you are a fan of Charisma.",1354406400,,873,4.0813953488372094
4285477,1,B0047UJBN6,"I enjoy Charisma Carpenter's work, I really do.  But this movie - how on earth did she let herself be talked into such a woeful waste of time?  To say the acting, beside hers, is abysmal would be an act of kindness.  The husband and the agent's acting was so bad it made me cringe.  At least it was a cheap buy.  There's nothing about this train wreck that is worth recommending.",1351814400,,379,4.208333333333333
4285478,4,B0047UJBN6,"This was a very enjoyable movie. We have watched Charisma in ""Angel"". She is a decent actress. Liked the bizzare twist at the end of the movie. Kept us in suspense. Would recommend this movie for thriller fans.",1346976000,,210,4.552631578947368
4285479,3,B0047UJBN6,"Psychosis is a pretty strange horror film.  Well it's not really strange in that it makes little to no sense.  I mean, at least we understand what the situation is- a woman who's a writer is terrified because the house she's staying in is apparently haunted.  Of course that's not the only thing taking place here.  Apparently her husband (or fiance, whatever) likes to cheat on her during those infamous ""out of town business trips"".  Yeah... we know what that means.

Meanwhile the woman remains at a countryside home and has numerous adventures of her own.  In one situation she finds herself wandering around through the woods only to come across two people going at it on the ground.  She freaks out but her husband assures her that that type of sexual behavior is perfectly normal in their country.  The man going at it with the chick actually becomes one of the main characters, and eventually the woman learns to accept him and understand that he's not so creepy after all after inviting him inside for dinner.

Well throughout the film the woman tries to concentrate on her writing in a dark computer room, but she encounters plenty of distractions that involve hallucinations and apparitions (one of which is a little boy kicking a soccer ball around outside).  Eventually it becomes too much and the woman loses her mind.  Will anyone believe her though?  It should be noted that her acting is pretty good.

The problem with the movie, and the reason I'm lowering the rating from a 5 to a 3, is because it's just not scary at all.  Nothing is.  It's not even really interesting either, but at least it tries to be on several occasions with the bloody bathtub, the man going at it with his floozy outside, the same man putting drugs in the writers stew during that overnight dinner I mention above, and of course, the husband who cheats around on his wife at fancy high dollar resorts.  The occasional visions of ghostly sightings is another highlight, but this aspect honestly wasn't used enough.  When ghosts were seen, it was treated like a normal everyday occurrence which, according to my interpretation, means the writers were going for something other than direct horror.  What it was I haven't a clue.

Overall, it's alright but no great shakes.",1334361600,,2263,4.739130434782608

4285481,1,B0047UJBN6,The first thing I discovered is that this movie is simply terrible...a total waste of time.  The second thing I discovered is that Charisma Carpenter can't act.  Need I say more?,1328227200,3,178,4.709677419354839
4285482,3,B0047UJBN6,"I was expecting a better movie from the name. I thought Psychosis was terribly unfocused on several accounts. The lead character, a writer is supposed to be mentally unbalanced. She was seeing several things that were ""unreal"" but there was never any ""real"" focus on that. The husband certainly had no pretense to her or me of being even a little concerned. This seemed unreal no matter what the circumstances were. I didn't feel any suspense for her to figuring anything out or becoming worse in her ""Psychosis"". The surrounding characters were just flat, where they could have been real colorful. And the sex scenes didn't add anything to it. I hate when movies have sex scenes just because they can. If it doesn't add something - please leave them out. The gory massacre at the beginning, infidelity, her writing a book, the creepy groundskeeper - none of it really tied into together very well. OK for a one-time viewing. I wouldn't watch again.",1313798400,3,949,4.7926829268292686
4285483,2,B0047UJBN6,"It starts off promising, and it reminded me of how much I missed Charisma Carpenter, and she looks great, but then... into the movie comes this grody groundskeeper, and then the movie starts sympathizing with the sleazy husband, and rapist groundskeeper, and not only do I feel sorry for the main character she plays, but I feel sorry for Charisma herself; that she felt she had to do a gratuitous rape scene for this job.  I would love to direct Ms. Carpenter, just to utilize her bitter comedic talents, something the director and crew did not care to explore.",1310947200,3,562,4.6767676767676765

4285485,1,B0047UJBN6,"This movie started out like it could have been a horror thriller, but NOT, it was more of the typical sense of what happens when the wife is made to look crazy and about to have a relapse by her cheating and lying husband who of course is behind the strange of events that do occur and than gets all of her money while she sits in the insane ward of a hospital.  This was a big disappointment of a  movie and a waste of movie film.",1307577600,5,431,3.942528735632184

She sees stuff and her husband cheats on her. Is he driving her crazy or is she seeing things? The problem is that we really don't care because the film wasn't that interesting.

8418330,3,B0047UJBN6,"So I finally got around to watching Charisma Carpenter in ""Psychosis"". At first as it started out I thought maybe I had the wrong movie because it looked like a tradition psycho slasher flick however I was pleasantly surprised. After the story took off, the way that the film kept me constantly focused on the deceit of her husband, and constantly trying to figure out just what the film was about, it totally threw me for a loop with the ending. Brilliant execution of the story. This was not an easy script to keep cohesive and relatable. At any point the film could have fell apart with all the subtext and micro plots that seemed to flutter about in the telling of this story.

For the most part I felt I was watching a psychological thriller just a bit above Lifetime Movie abilities and constantly wondering what the beginning had to do with f*ckall in this movie. It kept me guessing and confused visually as to the characters that played out in the Macbeth styled dance of twisted tales of betrayal and deception. The cinematography was gritty and yet polished with its total control of the film by jumping from micro plot to micro plot. Is she crazy? Is she psychic? or is some people totally f*cking with her?! I just kept bouncing back. This turned out to be a really great film and you don't realize just how intricate and detailed the plot is until the last 15 minutes of the film and that is got me totally into the story and made me drop my jaw. The ending tied it all up so poignantly and perfectly. A great psychological profile of the depths of human psychosis.",1438646400,,1579,4.482638888888889
