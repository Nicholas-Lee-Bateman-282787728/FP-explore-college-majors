2056472,4,B00022LAMS,"It's strange to think that both of these films - ""The General"" and ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" flopped at the box office when they appeared in 1927 and 1928 respectively. Today both are highly regarded silent films and ""The General"" is considered Keaton's finest film and perhaps the greatest silent film ever made.

What bothered 1927 audiences about ""The General"" is what makes the film great today - it is an artful combination of suspense and comedy. However, 1920's audiences just weren't willing to accept Buster in anything but a completely comic role. ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" was Keaton's last film as an independent filmmaker. In fact, the most famous scene from the movie - the one with Keaton standing still as the side of a house falls around him during a hurricane with just a small window in the wall fitting over him as it falls - was the result of Keaton learning about the decision of his benefactor, Joe Schenck, to close down Keaton's studio. Keaton often said he wouldn't have done this dangerous stunt if he hadn't been so angry and upset at the time.

I personally thought the video transfer on this set bordered on being too fuzzy. I'd stick with the Kino copy if you have the money. However, if you want a quick and cheap introduction to Keaton's best silents, I'd say that this copy is satisfactory, but nothing more. If public domain quality is OK with you, then I might suggest the even more cost effective&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buster-Keaton-Collection-15-Shorts-5-Movies/dp/B000LC3IR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buster Keaton Collection - 15 Shorts, 5 Movies</a>. For only ten dollars you get both of these films at about the same quality, maybe a little better, plus three other features and 15 of Buster's silent short films.",1205452800,7,1799,5.178694158075602
2056473,3,B00022LAMS,"The General and Steamboat Bill are two great and classic films by Buster Keaton. However, the versions presented in this collection could be better.

The General as a movie has some great drama and thrilling stunts even more so than the comedy! The comedy is somewhat subtle and personally I think Steamboat Bill Jr. is actually funnier. However, The General is a great movie in both its construction and the way it was filmed. It easily blends comedy, action and drama into the film giving it a great storybook quality as well as epic feel to it. Sometimes you thin k you are really watching scenes from the Civil War!

Steamboat Bill Jr., in some ways was actually filled with more humor and more thrilling stunts! This film contains the single most thrilling and funny shot in silent film history that is the side of a building actually and literally falling around Keaton!

I would recommend trying to find the best transfers of these films because they are true classics of the genre. For people who like slapstick comedy and epic war time storylines I recommend the modern day silent comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deserter/dp/B000MQCB0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deserter</a>. It takes place during the American Revolutionary War and has a lot more battle footage than The General but the film is very Keatonesque in style and comedy.

All in all I would give this collection 3 stars for film quality and 5 stars for the movies themselves.",1196294400,,1506,5.185185185185185
2056474,4,B00022LAMS,"I assume if you're looking at this, you already know about the films and their production, star, etc. In short, Keaton is hilarious!!!
  I bought this to see what was on it since there weren't any reviews.
  This is a release by Movie Ventures. It's a double-sided disc with one of the films on each side. There is no inside case insert. The transfer is fairly good. Some sound effects have been added (such as guns and cannons firing), and others have been incorporated into the music (such as the trains' distinctive sound, as well as their speeding up and slowing down, and people falling).
  The music itself is not 1920s music at all. It's all synthesized, and most of the train stuff is ""drumset"" (etc.) material. It definately sounds like MIDI. It's all very well synchronized with what's happening on the screen, but I don't think it does anything to make the film better. I was expecting old jazz on solo piano etc.
  The case says that ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" runs 111 minutes, but it's actually only 79 minutes (or 1 hour and 9 minutes). I don't know what's up with that. It doesn't say ""The End"" or anything.
  Despite the musical shortcoming, this is definately worth the $3.30 that I paid for it!
  God bless,

2056475,4,B00022LAMS,"Since nobody took the trouble of listing WHAT is inside of this edition, I bought one just to check it out. This DVD brings two of Buster Keaton's masterpieces: The General & Steamboat Bill Jr. Both transfers are worse than the Kino edition (which is the standard for Keaton's films). Even so, Steamboat... is not bad and the music is (if I remember well) the same as in Kino's edition. The General looks a bit fuzzier, the music is old jazz and not really related to the action, but not bad. If you take in consideration that this DVD is being sold for around a dollar... I think it's worth it. Still... to appreciate Keaton at his best, buy the Kino editions.

6-15-06 P.S.: Well, I see they finally put the title to this DVD. Mission accomplished... ???? I also see that the price went up a little... so beware...",1127520000,33,816,4.44

8020618,5,B00022LAMS,"I recall watching Keaton as boy and not being impressed. I started off on this disc with The General and almost turned it off. It took a while for the plot to develop, but after it did, WOW, what a great film - hilarious. Steamboat Bill Jr. was good too, but not quite up to The General as far as I'm concerned.

Now that I'm an adult I think I can appreciate Keaton's brand of humor. He generally accomplishes what he sets out to do, but not without a great deal of fumbling, errors, oversights and miscellaneous mishaps. These mishaps are not simply ludicrous, they have an almost painful-to-watch basis in reality. The way Keaton goes about accomplishing things reminds me a lot of myself - the polish is often lacking; a lot of fumbling and bumbling goes on, but the task gets done somehow.",1391385600,,794,4.475862068965517
8020619,5,B00022LAMS,"""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" teamed with ""The General"" is a silent comedy masterpiece of a DVD.  Should by required in all DVD collections!!!",1367280000,,134,5.090909090909091
8020620,4,B00022LAMS,"This imaginative comedy lacks the prestige of Buster Keaton's classic American Civil War comedy ""The General."" Nevertheless,""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" surpasses ""College."" Clocking in at a concise 71 minutes, this amusing father and son reconciliation drama includes a romance reminiscent of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo & Juliet."" Furthermore, the narrative chronicles the emergence of our diminutive protagonist as a man who can master his fate after he appeared destined for disaster. In other words, Buster plays an underdog again. The problem with this existential comedy is our hero's transition from a clumsy nincompoop to an expert acrobat who can perform high dives off the top of a steamboat and rig it in such a way that he can operate it alone lacks credibility. One of the most amazing features of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is its special effects. The special effects personnel pulled off these stunts long before computer-generated special effects were available.

The Carl Harbaugh story concerns a pugnacious Mississippi River paddle wheeler captain who meets his son, Willie (Buster Keaton of ""The Three Ages"") for the first time since he last saw him as an infant in the crib. Essentially, Bill does not know what Willie looks like. Meantime, Willie arrives from Boston dressed like a fashionable college graduate, wearing a beret, sporting a pencil thin mustache, a spotted bow-tie, and toting a ukulele under his arm. He has sent his father a telegram informing him that he will be able to recognize him by the white carnation that he will wear in his coat lapel. Bill (Ernest Torrence of ""Captain Salvation"") and his First Mate, Tom Carter (Tom Lewis of ""Adam and Eva""), head off to the railway station fully expecting to greet a big strapping lad twice the size of William Canfield, Sr. Nobody at the train station fits the bill for Bill Junior. As the train pulls out, it turns out that Willie Canfield has been out of sight on the other side of the tracks. He makes an idiot out of himself as he approaches all the men in the station and flashes his carnation at them. Eventually, he loses the carnation, but he does not realize it and he keeps poking his empty lapel into the faces of strangers. Finally, Bill and Tom recognize Willie by his luggage tag while he is dancing and playing his ukulele for a baby in a stroller.

Bill drags Willie to a haberdashery to replace the beret with a hat that a man would wear. Later, he leaves him in a barber chair and orders the barber to shave off the mustache. While Willie is seated in the barber chair, he notices that a cute little thing seating opposite him in another barber chair is Kitty King (Marion Byron of ""Song of the West""), who attended the same college. These two try to get together, but their fathers refuse to let them have a relationship. John James King (Tom McGuire of ""The Reckless Age"") tells Kitty that he will pick the right man for her and it will not be the son of a river tramp. Bill tells Willie that he will choose a mate for him that will not have King for a father. Steamboat Bill and King are competitors in the paddle wheeler business on the Missisippi River. Recently, King brought in his brand new paddle wheeler and convinces the Public Safety Commissioner condemn the paddle wheeler--the Stonewall Jackson--that Bill owns. Bill goes after King, and King has him thrown in jail. The same day that the sheriff puts Bill in jail is the very day that Bill had arranged transport for Willie back to Boston. Willie sees the authorities take his father to calaboose and contrives a scheme to break him out. He conceals several tools inside a giant loaf of bread and convinces the sheriff to let him give it to his father. Initially, Bill wants nothing to do with Willie until his son shows him what the loaf contains. Bill breaks out, but Willie is caught. The sheriff cracks Willie over the head with his six-gun and sends him off to the receiving hospital.

The major set-piece of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" is a high wind storm that tears up all the buildings in town, blows the top off the hospital and sends the jail into the river. The physical sight gags that Keaton performs are some of his best and most imitated. In one scene, the entire facade of a building falls on Willie, but he is standing where the window is so he is not hurt! Each gag is beautifully orchestrated by director Chas. F. Reisner who specialized in comedies, including the lesser Marx Brothers picture ""The Big Store"" and the Abbott & Costello comedy ""Lost in a Harem."" Even the smallest of gags, such as peanut hulls--which Bill refers to as coconut shells--that cut their bare feet up when they cross a floor are hilarious. The spectacle of Keaton clutching an uprooted tree that is hurled into the river is incredible as are the flying buildings that Buster runs into and out of. Of course, Willie and Kitty hook up in the end. Keaton performs all of his stunts and they are pretty amazing. ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" ranks as a memorable Buster Keaton epic with several well-staged gags.

Don't miss this one.

Incidentally, this review applies to the Quality video release of ""Steamboat Bill, Jr.""/""The General.""",1331424000,,5177,4.728682170542636
