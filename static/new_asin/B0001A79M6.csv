8008935,5,B0001A79M6,"The Cuban Hiphop Allstars documents the Cuban Hiphop movement in its infancy, 200-2001.  Most of the artists featured are on the first Cuban Hiphop compilation, with the same name; Obsesion, Anonimo Consejo, Explosion Suprema, Instincto, 100% Original, Pablo Herrera, Hermanos de Causa... as well as some great new talents, Papo Record, and Cuba's first straight up R&B girl group Sexto Sentido.  Alafia uses interviews, cyphers, live footage and little viniettes where the rappers act out little scenes from there music to paint a colorful picture of this extremely vibrant, explosive movement in Havana.  The piece has a real cinema verite feel and the music is great.  I really enjoyed it.  The extra scenes are interesting too, some live footage and more cyphers, including a beautiful scene where the rappers rap with drummers playing rumba and dancing in the street... EPIC CUBA!!!",1094256000,2,887,5.26241134751773
