8535077,5,B00936GV1E,Had to get the DVD version.. Covers all the fronts with one section devoted to partisan warfare. Good coverage from beginning to end with many never before seen footage. Series is long but good. Eastern front campaign is covered extremely well with  the post WWII be very interesting section in this series.,1526601600,,307,4.903846153846154

8535079,5,B00936GV1E,"The documentary was very informative!! And I've watched it about 3 times, since I got it for Christmas!! Its very good!!",1518134400,,120,4.761904761904762
8535080,5,B00936GV1E,"Although an aged product,  this still remains a relevant offering.  The length of nearly 10 hours alone lets you know this will be a through rendering.  I have watched the first two disks and am impressed so far and also expect more of the same with the last two disks.  I am unaware of anything on the Eastern Front that compares with the amount of information included in this collection.  Highly recommended!!!",1470182400,2,413,4.680555555555555
