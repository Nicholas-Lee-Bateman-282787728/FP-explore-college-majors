2426392,4,B000BMY2MO,"I am a big fan of Vincent D'Onofrio.  I enjoyed this movie not only because VDO was in it, but it was a story that could be famiiar with many families.  The fact that the everyone in the family had secrets that they did not share with other family members.  I believe that is representative of most families.  Maybe, just not to that extreme.",1295568000,,342,4.296875
2426393,5,B000BMY2MO,This is the first time I saw Vincent D'Onofrio years ago and I became a fan. This is just one of many of his films I have added to my collection.  It's also filled with many actors that have gone far in film and T.V.,1181520000,3,216,3.8
2426394,5,B000BMY2MO,"All the pieces come together in this film of complex intra- and interpersonal relationships. The story line, character development, directing, sets, and most of all acting are well balanced and of high quality so the mind is not pre-occupied with ""what is wrong with this picture"" thinking. Instead, the viewer can enjoy and engage with the film. ""Crooked Hearts"" is complex enough that subsequent viewings reveal new dimensions, so the investment in purchasing the DVD is a good value.",1142812800,9,486,5.1645569620253164
2426395,3,B000BMY2MO,"As usual, movies like this are pleasant surprizes.  The plot really didn't make much sense, as the whole ""we are family no matter what"" theme never really gelled.  What makes this movie a keeper is the feast for the eyes of Vincent D'Onofrio, the feast of the heart-strings of Noah Wylie and the charm of Juliette Lewis.  I am forever amazed at the talent of Mr. D'Onofrio, as I only knew him from Law & Order Criminal Intent.  Now I keep coming across gems he's made, and each character is different and facinating.  Kudos to a real actor!",1135468800,24,540,4.469387755102041
2426396,4,B000BMY2MO,"the one who wrote that this was the most dysfunctional family probably hasn't looked around much.. this was a GREAT movie... sure it was dysfunction times ten, but whose family isn't.. loved the movie... Great acting, great characters.. Vincent D'Onofrio was GREAT!  as usual he took his character over the edge!",1131148800,10,312,5.117647058823529

8089206,5,B000BMY2MO,I bought the movie and watched it twice. It was so good I just had to read the book. I needed to know more about this crazy family. I wish the ending in the book had been used in the film.,1374710400,,188,3.6097560975609757
8089207,3,B000BMY2MO,"Crooked Hearts is a cautionary tale of a reasonably loving but slightly dysfunctional family where the parents, in an attempt to nurture their children have, in fact, stifled them.  However, one of them has a secret that, due to lack of communication and misunderstanding, eventually leads to tragedy when it is revealed.  It is how they all deal with this heartbreak and their reactions to it and each other that makes for an interesting story.  At first glance it appears to be a lighthearted film but it gets darker and more satisfying.

A clever insight into how good intentions can sometimes go horribly wrong.",1351728000,2,615,4.884615384615385
8089208,3,B000BMY2MO,"I think this film had good intentions but did not quite get there.  This is a great example of misusing of a talented cast with poor writing.  Most of us have had the experience of having members of our family do things that hurt us that does not make sense, but in this film, many things are not explained that could have made it a better film.
 ""Dysfunctional"" does not seem to cover the Warren family. No family member seems to have a conventional mentality.  Mom is in denial and exhibits no self-esteem or control over her household. Dad has a very high opinion of himself preaching the importance of family yet keeps letters from his mistress (some unopened) for his sons to find. He seems to embrace his children's failures to make himself feel more superior.
 The daughter Cassie is a dimwitted narcoleptic that takes no precautions fully knowing she can fall asleep at the drop of a hat. Charlie (Vincent D'onofrio) the oldest son, hates his father for stealing a girl he admires and for his hypocrisy of not putting his family first. Charlie shows his anger for his father buy burning down the family home and sleeping with his brother's girlfriend. Tom (Peter Berg)the middle son, is a college dropout trying to get over his girl friend who is pregnant by Charlie. The youngest son (Noah Wyle),is weak and unsure of himself.  He is embarrassed by his father's indiscretion.  The boys burn the letters to save their father's secret, but she has known about the letters for years.  While burning the letters a wind scatters the ashes near a gas station and the youngest son chases the ashes into the path of a truck! It is extremely slow in some parts (using the fast forward button helped a few times).  Crooked Hearts is not a film I regret seeing, but I would not want to see again.",1348358400,,1794,4.58125
8089209,2,B000BMY2MO,"I just didn't get this one.  I needed a lot more to go on.  The characters were all over the place.  I needed more of an explanation, other than the obvious, for all the rage.  Good cast, though.",1322352000,,195,4.052631578947368
