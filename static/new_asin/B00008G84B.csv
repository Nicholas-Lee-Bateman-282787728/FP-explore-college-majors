Having been to the 25 at Thunderhill as a crew member in previous years (including the year this was filmed), it's a huge undertaking.  We are putting together a team for 2015, and Double Down has been a great inspiration as well a road map to success.. More or less.",1431993600,,409,4.575342465753424

7983404,5,B00008G84B,"I loved it! you feel like you're there. Lots of great footage - behind the scenes, inside the cars and on the tracks.
You get to see what it takes to complete an endurance race, and how big a feat it is to win a spot on the podium.
***** 5 stars!",1381795200,,246,3.75
