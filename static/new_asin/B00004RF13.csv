1343298,4,B00004RF13,"A realationship movie with a twist. This movie traces Perry and his Stephanie into the trials of a recent breakup, is this breakup for good who knows. In any relationship there seems to be people always poking there  noses where they don't belong(ieg perrys roomates).This movie shows that  you don't need glitzs and glamor to get your point across;just a simple  script and well written dialouge. Joesph, Perrys roomate has to be the well  crafted character in this movie he is the conscious mind of the film. All in  All this film is a great display of a new director using small time actors  to dispaly a major point. Two thumbs up.",964915200,,635,4.625

I enjoyed the realism of the love affair and it didn't play into any movie stereotypes..

Once I purched this movie for under two dollars and new I'm hooked with shopping on amazon. It was delivered within the four days. It was at a wonderful price. I will order again.

7921113,4,B00004RF13,"I originally caught this independent film on Sundance back in '97, and have enjoyed it countless times since.  The film is incredibly low-budget, but what it lacks in production value, it makes up for with its cast and writing. The dialogue is extremely funny, and offers a hilarious real-world perspective on relationships.

For not having many speaking roles before this one, RonReaco Lee did a great job as lead character Perry. It wasn't any surprise when I saw him landing recurring roles on a few TV shows as time went by, including one of my favorite programs: The Shield. The same applied to the solid actor E. Roger Mitchell as Perry's roommate, who landed a number of movies after making his debut with this one. Sahr Ngaujah also brought his theater experience to the table in his film debut, as Perry and Joseph's funny slacker roommate.

I loved the setting for the movie, it was obvious from the jump that it was shot in the South. I've spent a lot of time in Atlanta, so it was interesting to find out that's where it was shot (with an ATL cast).

This is a smart, well-written comedy with a cast at the start of successful acting careers.  A must-watch for anyone into indie flicks in the vein of Spike Lee's earlier work.",1271635200,,1238,4.583710407239819

It's disappointing that Xenon released the DVD with the cover they did, as it will only give people the impression that it's another Phat Beach or Black Spring Break 2.  This is a smart, well-written comedy with a cast at the start of successful acting careers.",1271635200,5,1427,4.556862745098039
7921115,4,B00004RF13,"At first glance the cover makes the movie seems like a low budget romp fest teen sex comedy, but its really not that at all. Actually none of the people on the cover even appear in the film. The film is about a guy and girl breaking up over the summer and how they deal with it. There are a lot of funny moments and some serious ones. I really like the way the film was directed being it was the director's first and last film. If you looking for something low budget and just fun to watch then pick it up you won't be disappointed.",1235088000,3,532,4.028301886792453
