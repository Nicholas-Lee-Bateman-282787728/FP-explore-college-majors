8447519,3,B004XWGZ3W,"I confess I am not sure how to rate this 1968 film from Universal. They churned out dozens of thrillers just like this in the 60's, only some were better. They usually had George Peppard starring and I can't help thinking he would have been a better Schyler than Kirk, but who knows? Perhaps I think this because I am not a huge fan of Mr Douglas, who here is in full topless mode whenever the script doesn't really deem it necessary!. His character is also rather unlikeable. The film has plenty of gloss but little substance. Very 60's style music (see the 2 disco scenes) and visuals, tho the photography is ambitious and interesting (New York and it's surrounds). On the plus side we have Eli Wallach doing what he does best even tho the script doesn't help him, ie steal every scene he is in. And of course, my reason for getting this DVD...Sylva Koschina, who spends of her screen time in a bikini, topless (on her stomach) or in ravishing nightware. She also displays a fair grasp of comedy. She is very good. It's a 3 hander really as the rest of the cast is anonymous even Kenneth Haigh (a bit miscast as the world's greatest playboy!). I was surprised to learn that this was Ali McGraw's debut, but darned if I spotted her. The DVD looks great, a good widescreen 2.35 ratio, with good colour and clear sound. No extras. Did I enjoy it?. Mostly but it isn't the best of its kind. Interesting tho and Kirk/Sylva fans will love it.",1426204800,3,1438,4.430188679245283
8447520,2,B004XWGZ3W,"""A Lovely Way to Die""

When I saw ""A Lovely Way to Die"" was being released as part of the Universal Vault series I thought, `Alright! I always wanted to see this film!' Well, I didn't miss much.

It seemed like a good idea...great stars like Kirk Douglas and Eli Wallach as well as great eye candy in Sylvia Koscina. The story concept was a good idea: an ex-cop (Douglas) becomes the bodyguard for an heiress (Koscina) whose husband has been murdered after being approached by her lawyer (Wallach).

Not surprising for me I bought the video when it was available on a foreign label because I'd wanted to see it so badly. I found myself falling asleep in the middle. And being the diehard movie buff I am, I bought it in the U.S. version when it came out. (Thought I would give the film the benefit of the doubt and give it another look without the subtitles.)

I've watched the movie twice and both times it appears the action becomes muddled in the middle of the story-it had nothing to do with subtitles! The best part of the movie is appreciating Miss Koscina's many attributes.",1340236800,5,1081,4.472081218274112
