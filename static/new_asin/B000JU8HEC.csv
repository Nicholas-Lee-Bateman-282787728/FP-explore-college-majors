2679451,4,B000JU8HEC,"CORSAIR (Artcinema, 1931), was director Roland West's last movie, and while he wasn't prolific, West's films were unconventional as to subject matter and innovative in their visual design.

Future ""Boston Blackie"" Chester Morris excels as a football hero who becomes a rum-runner in order to get even with the Wall Street big-wig who fired him. He does this by hijacking his former boss's deckloads of booze and selling them back to him. Ravishing Thelma Todd, billed as Alison Lloyd, is tops as the stock broker's society daughter whom Morris falls for. The supporting cast is first-rate, with Fred Kohler as the rival bootlegger whom Morris heists, Ned Sparks and Mayo Methot as a couple who are spying on Kohler, and Frank McHugh as Morris' loyal pal.

This interesting tale of Prohibition-era piracy on the high seas is unique among '30's gangster films in the way it equates the crooked business tactics of Wall Street with big-time racketeering. West's visual flair is well integrated with the narrative and is never obtrusive. CORSAIR also benefits from Ray June's extensive location photography on and off the coast of Catalina Island, which gives the film a freer feel than many other early talkies.

Alpha's DVD of CORSAIR looks fairly decent with good sound, and at such an affordable price is definitely worth picking up.

Quality update, 8/1/2017: A better copy of CORSAIR is available from Grapevine Video. It has age related wear but is sharper than Alpha's, having been transfered from an original print with night scenes tinted a subtle indigo.",1380240000,5,1561,5.062256809338521
2679452,4,B000JU8HEC,"I wasn't expecting much from this film. I watched it mainly because it stars two favorites of mine - Chester Morris and Thelma Todd. I was very pleasantly surprised. The film opens with John Hawks (Chester Morris), a collegiate football star, winning the big game. Later that night, at a society party, he meets Alison Corning (Thelma Todd) who personifies every argument in favor of the inheritance tax you've ever heard with the saying ""spare the rod spoil the child"" thrown in for good measure. She's beautiful, spoiled, used to getting whatever and whoever she wishes, and will do anything for a thrill. John's bad luck is that she wants him from first sight. She convinces her big Wall Street financier dad, ""Steve"" as she calls him, to give John a job at his firm. John is hardly enamored by Alison. He can see right through her, and on the surface that's got to be a pleasant experience for any guy, but then you get to the not-so-gooey middle. This is what repels him.

So John takes the job, not really knowing what to do after college anyways, but soon he sees that Alison is the apple that has not fallen far from the tree. Dad is all about making money and he doesn't care if he has to scam orphans and widows to do it. When John refuses to hard sell some worthless stock to an old lady in exchange for her solidly performing bonds he's tossed out without a second glance by dear old Steve.

John then decides to take to piracy on the high seas - after all it's not too different from what Alison's dad is doing - except he will steal from crooks not orphans and widows. John sets his sights on one bootlegger in particular, and with the help of a wealthy friend who backs him financially by helping him buy a boat (Frank McHugh as Chub), he starts to regularly hijack gangster ""Big John's"" haul of bootleg liquor and sell it to Steve, his old employer, who is into bootlegging himself as a sideline.

Now the problem here is that John doesn't spread the pain around to various bootleggers - he picks strictly on Big John's boats. He should realize that Big John did not get where he got by dropping out of Sunday school and sooner or later he is going to retaliate. I'll let you watch and see how this all shakes out.

I just thought it was very clever and timely for a filmmaker to equate the robber barons of Wall Street with piracy on the high seas. In fact, it makes pirates look noble compared to the Wall Street banksters. There's also some gritty reality thrown in via Mayo Methot's Sophie, the typist for Big John who's beautiful but beaten down by life in the Depression and the constant companionship of ruffians just trying to make a living. Her relationship with Ned Sparks' ""Slim"" is touching. Slim is one of Big John's men, and the couple is helping out John Hawks in his acts of piracy against Big John in return for a percentage, hoping to get out of ""the life"" once and for all. The ever present danger of getting caught - if they are lucky, by the law, if not so lucky, by Big John, makes them underplay their emotions for one another and their emotional caution turns out to be quite touching.

If you like Chester Morris or Thelma Todd, if you want to see a different kind of gangster film, if you think that many of the people running Goldman Sachs and AIG deserve to be cell mates with Bernie Madoff but will probably never learn their lesson from anybody or anything in this life, give this almost forgotten little film a chance.",1369526400,4,3465,4.424764890282131
2679453,3,B000JU8HEC,"The director of ""The Bat"" and ""The Bat Whispers(a sound version)"" returns to production with 1932's ""Corsair"". Flamboyant Roland West's ""Corsair"" stars his favorite Chester Morris as a failed stockbroker who roams the high seas robbing bootleg liquor from other bootleggers, including his former boss(and father of his girl friend). Morris huffs and puffs(he's a former football star) as best he can, with all the 1930's bravura he can muster. The location photography at sea is good, but the story drags in the middle. The pretty blond is played by West's true-life lover, Thelma Todd, who just a few years later would be found mysteriously murdered(or not) in a car in front of their Malibu Beach restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway. Director Roland West was later charged with murder, but was eventually acquitted. The scandal would ruin his career, and no more films would follow. One of Hollywood's most inovative talents would see an early end to his success. Warch ""Corsair"" for a number of brilliant lighting and photographic effects. On his deathbed, actor Chester Morris(""Boston Blackie"") whispered that West had told him that he had actually killed Thelma Todd.",1256947200,11,1172,5.173684210526316

8153172,2,B000JU8HEC,"I purchased this because my husband and I enjoy Chester Morris in the ""Boston Blackie"" series.  Morris is okay in this early (1931) sound film, but the film itself is molasses-slow and just not that good.  Furthermore, the film quality is poor on the ""Reel Enterprises"" release; there are no menus, the film just runs on a loop, and the ""RL"" logo appears constantly in the lower right.  The basic plot of ""Corsair"" involves Morris's John Hawks stealing the rum shipments of his former boss, a corrupt Wall Street tycoon.  Despite this, and despite the fact that he seems to despise the boss's daughter, she's stuck on him, and he implausibly falls for her too.  You can do much better than ""Corsair"".  Stick with the ""Boston Blackie"" films, for much better Chester Morris and much more entertainment.",1440460800,,800,4.802919708029197

Poor boy does good, foils the bad guys and gets the beautify rich girl.
Enjoy!",1400198400,,143,4.333333333333333
8153175,5,B000JU8HEC,"Okay, so the production quality was antiquated and the acting was the way they acted in the early stages of ""talkies"", but Corsair was a good old movie that was more than just entertainment.  It actually made a statement about the corruption on Wall Street back in the day!  A young Chester Morris, the beautiful Thelma Todd, the always recognizable Ned Sparks and Frank McHugh with his signature obnoxious laugh were supported by a few decent character actors of its day and made the movie satisfying.  Don't expect the picture or sound to be anywhere near to today's standards, however don't let that deter you from selecting this movie.",1396483200,2,639,4.844036697247707
8153176,1,B000JU8HEC,"I am a Chester Morris fan and this offered one of his earlier movies.  Understanding this is a very old film, the quality has probably deteriorated over time.  It was difficult to watch because of the picture quality.  Also plot and acting wasn't that great.",1389139200,,258,4.688888888888889

The film features a VERY young Morris in the starring role.
