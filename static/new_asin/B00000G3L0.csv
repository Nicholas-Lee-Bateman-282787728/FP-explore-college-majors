1216630,4,B00000G3L0,"Many of the actors are cross-overs from Friday the 13th, the Series.  Including: Chris Wiggins (Jack Marshack), Sean McCann (Johnnie's ""Pop""), David Ferry (the punchy boxer in the boxing-gloves episode), and Bernard Behrens (Robert E. Lee in the Civil-War/time-travel episode).  The music and overall atmosphere are similar to the show: anxious and brooding, with thin faces and vivid colors.",1265328000,,392,5.627118644067797
1216631,5,B00000G3L0,"Moody, dark, southern, rich in suspense and captivating characters.  Do you know how many movies David Strathairn and Mary McDonnell have made together?  Beautifully matched talent.  The story is built carefully and slowly, with the kind of twist in the climax following climax that satisfies.  It is truly a worthy story that deserves more attention and more air time than it has obviously had.  I wish it would be reintroduced even on the oxygen channel, or lifetime, or hallmark, somewhere so that enough interest might land it on a dvd recording.",1189296000,7,550,5.0
1216632,4,B00000G3L0,"Murder stories with a Southern setting have a dark and eerie sense all their own and EVIDENCE OF BLOOD is no exception.  This finely wrought film boasts a good story line with enough ongoing kinks resulting in new insights to keep you glued to the screen.  David Strathairn as a writer of mysteries returns to his hometown, meets his newly departed best friend's girl (Mary McDonnell, and begins to unravel an old murder that happened in his childhood.  The mysteries surrounding this rather unlikely and bizarre trial and execution of McDonnell's father leave some  of the townsfolk silently confused, but it is clear that the truth behind the grisly deed is better left unknown if the smalltown mentality is to be unrumpled.  But this story is about much more than a retrospective surveillance of a foggy murder.  It is more about the mysteries of early childhood that are buried with every loss of a relative who could bear witness.  There is a dark part to each of us, whether self created or victimized. Seeking to discover our true identity can be a very frightening journey.  Strathairn and McDonnell give sensitive performances as does the large cast of supporting characters.  One jolt here: though everyone speaks with either an Appalachian or Southern accent, we never know the location of this odd town - just that it is somewhere north of Alabama!  And the fact that the film was shot in Toronto doesn't give a clue.  A good mystery for an evening of escape behind safely locked doors of your home.",1034035200,33,1511,4.795366795366795
1216633,4,B00000G3L0,"I loved this movie.  It does have a slower, more deliberate pace than most but this is necessary to lay out all of the intricate details of a 30 year-old murder mystery (nicely done with flashbacks)and also to explore the characters.  I think both David Strathairn and Mary McDonnell are incredible actors (in another realm, actually) and the supporting cast is also very strong.  I noticed it was filmed in the Toronto area which is very close to me - too bad they didn't have a sunny day for any shoots, but maybe that was intentional!  If you enjoy a good mystery and appreciate truly fine acting, you'll enjoy this movie.",1024358400,15,625,4.603603603603603
1216634,5,B00000G3L0,"I loved this movie.  Though the pace is a bit slower than your run-of-the-mill murder mystery, that pace allowed for some very realistic character development.  The viewer is drawn into the story--I hated to stop  the tape to put my son to bed.  The brooding quality never got so dark and  heavy that it was simply painful to watch.  Instead, it just kept you  going, waiting for the next turn.  I rented the movie because I saw David  Strathairn and Mary McDonnell on the cover, not because I knew anything  about the movie.  It was a true gem.  The viewer starts to figure out the  plot just as the main character figures things out.  The acting is so good,  you can see each discovery move across his face just as you learn about it.  The mood is created with absolute conviction.  Everyone involved did a  superb job.  If you're up for a GOOD (not mediocre) mystery, check out this  video.",952300800,79,893,4.4625

1216872,5,B00000G3L0,"The movie has just ended and I want to share my thoughts immediately because this is such a unique film.. While it is a made for TV movie made in 1998, it has the quality of some older movies from the 1950s. I wanted a mystery to round out the 4th of July weekend, but something on the quiet side because my neighbors have been providing enough noise with their varied fireworks to compete with the professionals. Finding this one, with the wonderful leads of David Strathairn and Mary McDonnell was a bonus.

Others provide details about the plot, so I want to convey impressions. Because I love thoughtful mysteries where the writes consider their audiences to be an important part of the process, this slower paced, story of a man returning home because of his best friend's unexpected death gave me a journey that felt genuine and organic. The mystery grew as the journey continued unraveling, drawing me into the losses suffered by Jackson and Dora as we learn more about them.

The writing, based upon a book of the same name by Thomas H. Cook, is very clever, suspenseful, and provides increasing tension as more questions are raised rather than answers being found. Some people have mentioned that the pacing felt too slow for them, a valid point if you are hoping for a Hollywood blockbuster to accompany the fireworks outside.

If, however, you would like to counterbalance that noise and accompanying concern about new potholes in the street tomorrow morning, this is a film that you may enjoy. Personally, I love to watch intelligent individuals - who have more than a fifth grader's grasp of American English - using in pursuit of information that might fill the holes of missing evidence. It is also a pleasure when people disagree over issues without demonstrating a need to place a weapon in hand to argue a point; especially, when the disagreement or argument has not resulted in cruel and unusual verbal attacks.

Somehow, a soft spoken comment the Jackson ""might be sorry if he continues looking into a long-solved murder trial"" feels far more potent than when guns are blazing and Jackson needs to visit the ER.

In our current age, we have different ideas of what an 'Adult' film will mean, and I find it amazingly refreshing when characters meet tough challenges (demonstrating a range of emotions) with some civility - which is not boring - and without the usual histrionics. Yes, sometimes like is that devastating, yet equally shock may provoke a different physical reaction.

At the conclusion Jackson promises Dora that he will tell her everything that he has discovered, some of which will alter her life. The scene closes as they sit on her front porch looking at each other, so we do not witness anything further in their story. Although we do not know how she or everyone else in town will respond to the news, we can extrapolate the results in our own ways and find satisfaction.

Personally, I enjoy stories that are open leaving room for the characters to grow, so this was a completely satisfying film with these wonderful leads and the support staff proving the necessary entertainment break.",1467676800,,3128,4.802973977695167
1216873,3,B00000G3L0,"Great plot, but a little hard to follow.  The story line kept you guessing.",1467676800,,75,4.357142857142857
1216874,4,B00000G3L0,"The acting in this film is ok, but not terrific. The story moves slowly. The dialogue is often simplistic. Yet, the plot is good, there are red herrings, and the ending is a surprise.
A writer of true murder mysteries hears that his best friend, the very small towns sheriff, died of a heart attack. He travels to the town and learns that his friend was investigating a murder committed 40 years ago, for which a man was executed. The man was found guilty for killing a girl whose body was never found.
Among other things that he finds are that the only evidence against the allegedly guilty man was the testimony of a man who said he saw the man with the girl just before she disappeared. No real search was made to find the girl. Only the dress that the girl wore was found. The dress disappeared after the trial. The man was represented by a lawyer who was convinced the man was guilty. The dead sheriff abandoned his search for the killer days before his heart attack. He left a twig for his friend to help him solve the case.",1467676800,,1030,4.341968911917099

David Strathairn and Mary McDonnell are excellent here (as they are in any project), but the main feature here is a complex murder mystery spanning two generations.  Sure, the basic premise - guy returns to the small town of his birth & becomes embroiled in a local mystery - yes, that's been done before, but never this well.  The pace occasionally is as slow as a ceiling fan spinning in a Southern courthouse, but you will always want to know 'what happens next' - you will be engaged and entertained throughout.

There is an intentionally slow pace to the movie as the author gradually begins to discover more elements of the crime and of his own past, and as his relationship with the daughter of the man convicted and executed for the crime begins to develop.  At the end you realize the moral struggles that some of the characters, especially the sheriff, have gone through as they try to balance revealing the truth against doing the right thing.

The story/screen play is just incredibly written, dropping new clues every 5 minutes, building up to just a great finale, which you never suspected, but it all built up to.  That would have been good enough to make it a good movie, but the acting!!...  So realistic on every character, and there are many.  A bit part, but the woman who played David Strathairn's mother, when she has her 3 minutes on the trial stand, oh my God, so real.  So convincing and in her Southern personality!!!  At least 15 characters in various parts, playing various pieces in this mystery, with such excellent acting.

I am surprised that this movie seems to have been buried in the vault with little exposure to the public.  An MGM film but as far as I can tell it went straight to video and then was buried.  What a shame!!!",1439078400,,849,4.496732026143791

1217906,3,B00000G3L0,"Nothing is more fun to watch than a really good mystery, and for nearly an hour, I thought I'd found one in Evidence of Blood. Films like this one really irritate me, because they are so good, well-written, and thoughtful, until the end. In the end, so many weird things happen, and the film twists in so many different directions, that when it's all said and done, the audience is left scratching it's head. Jackson Kinley (David Stathairn) is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, who returns home to the small town he was raised in. He's come back home, because his best friend, the town sheriff, has been found dead. It's no mystery how he died, it was a heart attack, but the mystery lies in where he was found and what he was doing there. Kinley follows the clues and figures out that the sheriff was close to solving the only murder in the towns history, one that took place nearly 30 years earlier. The story here is textbook, as Kinley finds what his buddy was working on and follows the evidence. The viewers learn what he learns as Kinley discovers it. Nothing is held back, leaving us to think for ourselves and letting us trying to figure out who did what and why. To me, these are the best types of mysteries, because they don't assume the audience is brain dead, and it feels like you're actually out there with Kinley, trying to solve the crime. David Stathairn stars, and has been, and will continue to be one of the most underrated actors in all of modern cinema. When you look at his IMDB page, this guy has been in everything and played some huge roles, but for some reason is always overlooked. Rarely is his name at the top of the marquee, but roles like this prove that it should be. For the first hour of Evidence of Blood, I was in love with this film, but then it got to the end, and everything fell apart. The pace of the movie seemingly triples and a million things are thrown at us at once, making for a very confusing and unsatisfying end to an otherwise great story.",1430438400,,1992,4.386486486486486

If elocution lessons had not destroyed the Southern drawl that was prevalent in that region of the country, it would have come across better; phony accents are phony accents. I was disappointed that there was the obligatory gratuitous bedroom scene. I am of the opinion that our culture is fixated on sex, sometimes casual, sometimes graphic. I don't want to see this since I am well aware of what the act is. It didn't add anything to the story and if the characters just had to engage in sex, the act could have very easily been implied and the point would have been made quite well. Script writers have no imagination any more, it seems. The movie does have its moments and some fairly good characterizations of Southern folk and their mindset..",1428796800,,821,4.63013698630137

One reviewer said he or she didn't know where it took place.  It was supposed to be Georgia hill country, according to the newspaper clipping Jackson pulls out of a tin box near the end of the movie.  My only complaint was about Dora's accent.

The acting is perfect, the plot twists and turns, nothing is what it seems. I've never seen David Strathairn in anything before, but I will actively seek out his movies.

1218000,3,B00000G3L0,"I often think its unfair to judge a movie by its book - but in this case - I think the book's complexity was part of the downfall of this film.

Thomas Cook's twisting, multi-layered novel was a tough one to bring to the screen  and overall, this film does a decent job of covering the main points of the story but Cook's twists and turns are a double-edged sword when you need to pare the story down into just over an hour.

In ""Evidence of Blood"" Pulitzer prize-winning true-crime writer Jack Kinley - is as fine and complex a lead character as we've seen outside of a Dennis Lehane story - and in this tale Jack returns to his poverty-stricken mountain home roots after the death of his old friend Ray.

While originally Jack is unwilling to accept that Ray's death at the bottom of  a canyon is just a normal heart-attack - he finds his attention turned not to his childhood pal's death but to the case Ray was working on when he died - the 40-year old disappearance of a young girl who's body was never found. A seeming slam-dunk case - complete with evidence in the defendant's car and his own confession to  the crime - Jack is intrigued as to what it was his old school chum was possibly investigating.

The film is beautifully shot and atmospheric and uses wonderful editing to seamlessly move between the ""past"" of the investigation and trial of doomed, sad-sack laborer Lloyd Overton and the present - and it is in the scenes of the trial and the past is where this movie really shines.

The present-day romance between Jack and Ray's girlfriend  Dora is really nonsensical - and an addition made only thanks to Hollywood. (Dora is very much a minor character and in the novel Jack is pulled into the mystery by Ray's loving but exasperated wife and his daughter - characters who don't even exist in the film version) and I wish women who play characters who are described as ""mysterious"" would learn to do more with their parts than just sigh. mope, pout and stare moodily into the distance. Mary McDonnell's Dora is so blank and uninteresting we can't help but wonder why on earth either Ray or Jack would want to have anything to do with her.

Unfortunately - since the original story is so complex and takes such a long time to unravel - you can almost feel the Director panicking to cram all the loose ends in within the last thirty minutes and as a result Jack's own personal story seems rushed and slapped together at the end - which is a shame as it is one of the best parts of the book.

this film does a decent job but do yourself a favor and make sure you read the novel.",1410825600,15,2593,4.392484342379959

I loved the two actors and the plot was intricate and I was surprised at the ending and how the actions of so many people dovetailed to bring an entire town to wrong conclusions.  The dead accused man was very pitiful and engendered compassion on my part and Mary McDonnell played the part, as she usually does, with depth and that caramel voice of hers tinged with a Southern accent.

1218040,3,B00000G3L0,"This made for TV-er is Okay but it doesn't reach any new heights.

Here's the scoop. David Strathairn plays a true crime writer in New York who visits his home town in Alabama predicated by the death of an old friend. At the behest of his deceased buddy's girlfriend (Mary McDonnell) he gets caught up in investigating a murder which took place when he was a child. A suspicion grows that the wrong man might have been convicted and executed.

This is Okay. It's interesting seeing Strathairn in his pre-grey haired days. He does a decent enough job. Mary McDonnell, on the other hand, wears her typical silent suffering face throughout. Seems to me if you've seen her in one movie, you've seen everything she can do. All the supporting cast are decent. One of the problems here might have to do with the fact it was made for TV. Needing to be timed for commercial breaks, the evidence unfolds at such a regular pace you can set your watch to it. Plus, in similar movies, the Strathairn character would have a true threat to not proceed in the investigation. Here, he gets leaned on a bit, but nothing bad enough to make him consider packing up and going home. And the final pieces fall together in a clumsy, revelatory manner which smacked of someone looking at their watch and saying ""Hey! We're running out of clock."" So there is an information avalanche in the final few minutes.

This is actually a decent and clever story. I guess the handling was a bit too pedestrian for my taste. If you're looking for something mildly diverting this isn't bad, but there are a lot better out there.",1327968000,3,1591,4.555944055944056

The cast was wonderful and I've already watched the movie twice since recieving it last week! The movie is a bit slow, but I think that's part of what makes it great. You get to figure things out along with the characters. And even though it's mostly about solving an old murder mystery, it's also about the lives of the two main characters and how their lives intersected long before they knew it. It's a wonderful story and a must watch!",1316995200,,663,4.107692307692307
1218042,4,B00000G3L0,"Ever get a large present that was actually a small gift in several boxes? You unwrapped each box wondering just how big the actual gift is and what could it possibly be. You patiently goe through each layer in suspense of when you will get to the actual gift. This is such a present. It may be a small TV production, but it is well worth the wait to see the surprise at the end. I hope this movie comes out on DVD. I just used instant watch at Netflix and was surprised I had not heard of it before. Well done mystery with a good cast, directing, and production. Although not fast paced it keeps your interest throughout and slowly builts to a shocking revelation. The story involves a writer that mainly focuses on criminal cases and murder mysteries. After viewing the execution of the murderer in his most recent book endeavor he receives news that his best friend, the town sheriff, has passed away. He returns to his home town to attend his funeral. As he goes through his belongings he finds out he was investigating an old case of murder that was supposedly solved long ago and that he wished to inform him about. As the writer tries to find out more he runs into some roadblocks and some that are anxious to help. The ending is surprising and illuminating for him and brings the truth of what really happened to the surface.

1218043,5,B00000G3L0,"This title popped up as a recommended watch on a movie rental site my husband and I subscribe to and when I saw that David Strathairn of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steel-Toes/dp/B000RN87CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steel Toes</a>&nbsp;was in it, I decided to give it a try. Though this is a made-for-TV drama, it is one of the better murder mysteries I've watched on the small screen. The movie unfolds quite slowly, but I think this is necessary to enable the viewer to puzzle out the mystery leading to a truly gripping climax.

David Strathairn plays Pulitzer prize-winning author Jackson Kinley who returns to his hometown somewhere in Georgia to attend the funeral of his old buddy Ray, who was the town's sheriff. Kinley suspects something is amiss when he discovers that Ray was working on a old case (long thought to have been an open and shut case). The case dates back almost forty years, involving the murder of a young teenage girl, a crime for which Dora Overton's (Mary McDonnell) father was found guilty of and executed. As Kinley digs deeper, he uncovers some startling revelations that point to a conspiracy involving some prominent townspeople. Kinley also finds himself being plagued by nightmares that take him back to his own childhood. Could Kinley's long-suppressed memories actually provide some clues to the case he's working on?

The story is well-written and though it takes a while to take off, every scene enables the viewer to piece together what happened forty years ago, so that the viewer is eventually able to figure things out. The acting by Strathairn is credibly done, but credit also goes to the rest of the cast, including McDonnell, and even the other supporting actors such as Jackie Burroughs who plays Kinley's Granny Dollar (I was actually surprised to see two cast member's of [[ASIN:B000PMGNI6 Road to Avonlea: The Complete Seventh Volume, i.e. Jackie Burroughs who played Hetty King in the series, and David Ferry who played banker Stuart McRae in the seventh season of RTA). There's even the actor from Friday the 13th - just a bit of trivia there.

On the whole, this is a leisurely-paced murder mystery that rewards the patient viewer.",1293926400,,2234,5.165745856353591

But I never really got into the spirit of the movie, because none of the major characters made an impression on me. One reason was David Strathairn's acting performance which I found particularly unpersuasive, and the character he portrayed remote and artificial. In addition, his relationship with Mary McDonnell completely lacked a spark, making it a superfluous element in the story.
