3883628,4,B002ACJ3GS,I thought this was a good workout Alot of static moves which were a little more challenging but I like it. worth what I paid for it.,1284076800,,132,3.925925925925926
3883629,2,B002ACJ3GS,Was looking forward for this and found the quality of the dvd to be poor. It is OK for around 15 minutes of it and then it starts to freeze and the picture shakes. It would start again and less then 30 seconds the problem was back. I was trying to get my husband to do a workout with me and found this one. I didn't return because I had thrown away all the return labels. I have emailed Amazon and have not received any response.,1275782400,,429,4.0
3883630,5,B002ACJ3GS,"Gilad is amazing!  I love the martial arts drills, and the cardio is great for those of us in our 50's!  I have been watching him off and on for about 25 yrs.  He knows his stuff and I am instantly drawn into his workouts when I start hearing that music.  I am glad he is still around and influencing everyone to do their best.  When I miss my own workouts I know that I can make up for it using his program.  He hits all the areas!  He looks even better now than he did when he first started.  I already own several of his videos, and am purchasing the sculpt plus.  He is a classic instructor, and keeps up with current popular types of excercise, ie: pilates, yoga, martial arts, stretching.  I wish I lived in Hawaii to do the workout there!",1273276800,6,745,4.111111111111111
3883631,5,B002ACJ3GS,"I would recommend and use this seller again. The item was received in good condition and exactly as it was described, in a timely manner. Thank you!",1272326400,,148,4.518518518518518
3883632,2,B002ACJ3GS,"If you get this, do so for the sculpting segment, the cardio is ""punch, punch,hit, hit, 1-2-3, jab, jab, upper cut, jab, jab..."" Redundant, unimaginative, completely boring! The sculpting parts are good but taken from his TV show so ""do the other side during the commercial break"" just gets left out. Yes, you could stop the tape and do it, but if you're going to sell it as a separate video and are editing it anyway--why not pan out to the surf or other and have a voice over count it out?! Simple to do and would make a much more professional product.  I've always been a Gilad fan so am disappointed when he's not as good as he could be.",1272240000,10,641,4.297520661157025
3883633,5,B002ACJ3GS,"I liked everything about this video.  It burns about 350 calories.  The only thing I didn't like was the boxing cardio.  It is not that I didn't like it, just not used to it.  Recently bought it so it is still new yet.  I would highly recommend it.  YOu will feel it!",1266969600,2,267,4.038461538461538
3883634,3,B002ACJ3GS,"The video is an overall good workout which can easily be done at home.  I like the cardio sections, and the weight portion is decent if you use more weights than Gilad is using.

I was surprised that no one caught the errors during the editing process for the DVD.  He forgets to complete two of the exercises on the opposite leg during the #2 workout.  I just paused and did it myself, but I wonder why they used those clips for the DVD when clearly there were mistakes.",1266969600,9,471,4.258426966292135
3883635,5,B002ACJ3GS,"These are segments of his TV shows, and each workout lasts about 45 minutes.  When there is a commercial break scheduled for the TV show, then you jump right into the next segment. Although I don't like workout out with that quick change of pace, the workout is quite challenging.  I will hold light weights sometimes to make it even more challenging.  I am slowed by mild heart failure, and the pace of Gilad workouts is very tolerable for me at the age of 57.  I used to very active, a long distance runner, but age and injury has slowed me down.  I don't think Gilad knows this, but those people who used to be athletically active in younger years but now find themselves fatigue-limited in older years, have a good solution to fitness with Gilad exercise routines.  He motivates me but not over-motivates me.",1265760000,17,812,4.56551724137931
3883636,4,B002ACJ3GS,"This is a great workout on a day that I don't have a lot of time.  I think I get more out of the cardio portions, then I do the weight training...but the weight can always be up'd.  Plus Gilad is funny to listen to....",1261353600,7,218,3.8222222222222224
3883657,3,B002ACJ3GS,"I love Gilad, but this DVD is like watching him on TV. It cuts out like its going to commercial then cuts back in with him doing a different workout.",1412380800,,149,4.0
3883658,4,B002ACJ3GS,It's just t.v. shows taped together. I loved working out to him daily until the network his show was on reformatted their line up. Having the DVD's makes me very happy and excited to get back into shape.,1368921600,,203,4.368421052631579
3883659,5,B002ACJ3GS,"I started working out with Gilad after seeing his workouts in my motel room during a skiing trip.  It was very cold outside, and there was something about working out with him infront of the ocean that really appealed to me.  I looked for his series on tv when I arrived home and was hooked!  However, three years ago my husband and I started our family.  Two years later and two kids later, I realized that I was really out-of-shape.

This past Christmas, I asked my husband to give me the three DVDs in his Total Body Sculpt Plus series.  I wanted to get back into shape with something that I knew worked in the past.  Each DVD has two workouts, and if you workout 5 days a week, you're never doing the same workout in a week.  That is great for me, because if you do the same DVD over and over you memorize the mannerism of the people in the video.

Early in January 2013, I popped in one of the three DVDs, and I started doing a 45+ minute workout about 5 days a week, rotating the three DVDs.  Most of my workouts are typically with both of my young kids in the room (ages 3 and 10 months), and by the end they are crawling on me during the abs segment.  So honestly, I never really complete the whole abs segment.  However, I've completed probably 40+ minutes of the routine at that point.

Similar to another reviewer, if you were an athlete in the past, it's like having your old high school coach guiding you through these workouts.  He is a very gentle, yet motivating guy!  Today is February 11th, and I'm already seeing the results in my body and the clothes I'm wearing.  I started out at a ladies size 10, and today I'm comfortably wearing a size 8.  It's very satisfying knowing that working in front of a DVD will actually get you results.  Don't get me wrong, these workouts will WORK you, but you will get results.  You need to trust him and stick with the program.

I've read a lot of good review about his 45/45 Split Routine and Gilad Lord of the Abs.  I would love to throw these two DVDs in my weekly plan to mix things up.  I'll update my review in a month or so, so that you know how I'm coming along!  But, I think this is a great series, especially if you live in a colder climate like I do, and you can't get outside to workout 12-months a year.",1360540800,2,2273,4.186635944700461
3883660,5,B002ACJ3GS,"I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get healthy, reform your muscles and build strength while you burn fat.",1359763200,,115,4.523809523809524
3883661,3,B002ACJ3GS,"My wife has been using these DVDs on occasion to work out when she can't get to her regular classes.  She feels these disks are OK, but not really intense enough for her liking.  She uses these DVDs to provide an example, and then she improvises.",1358294400,,246,4.326086956521739
3883662,5,B002ACJ3GS,"The DVD has met my expectations.  I record the workouts on Fit TV, but wanted to be able to have a longer workout time.  Gilad's workout DVD hit every part of the body.",1350000000,,168,4.0606060606060606
3883663,4,B002ACJ3GS,"Includes 2 made-for-tv shows, both featuring light weights.

Show 1 features a lot of static holds, engaging every muscle group in the body. The first sculpting segment begins with a smooth side-lunge, which works the legs, buttocks, and hips. I did find this entire show worked better either with shoes or a yoga mat. Once he adds the weights to the side lunges balance can become an issue. It's difficult to do what amounts to deep-knee bends with one leg crossed behind me. The static holds he introduces are amazingly simple in concept and difficult to perform. I sweat as profusely doing these as I did doing bicep curls and such!

The cardio segment almost seems like a cool-down after that! Yes, he does keep the movement going, which is such a relief after the stresses of the prior segment. Loosens up everything, yet keeps the blood flowing.

Sculpting segment 2 begins with side-lunges, which is fine enough, but then he goes into an extended version of that. This is where those of us with questionable knee stability have difficulty. The rest of the segment features more static poses, which do a killer job on muscle toning! Outside of that beginning part I really enjoy this show.

It does leave me feeling like I've had an intense workout, including shaky arms and legs, so a 15 minute break afterwards is an absolute must, especially if you have thick hair to wash in the shower!

Show 2 emphasizes the legs far more than the upper body. There are no lunges, thank goodness, as those are very difficult on those of us with bad or weak knees. I don't need to wear shoes either as there is very little that needs specific positioning of the foot required, nor nearly as much of the static poses requiring stable toe grip.

I do like how he provides a moving stretch after a move has been repeated 16 or so times, thus breaking up the stiffness that threatens the long back muscles.

One big disappointment is the lack of attention to continuity. In both sculpting segments he forgets to include certain movements. The first segment is easy to make up for as he transitions positions, so I just stop the dvd and perform the move. The second segment, however, doesn't provide that opportunity and it's much more difficult to stop the disc to perform the move without breaking the position.

As always, his abs section is thorough. I have trouble with the stretching on the first show as my back doesn't work that way, but instead I do stretches I'm more familiar with that accomplish similar effects.",1338076800,4,2513,4.669683257918552
3883664,5,B002ACJ3GS,Bought this DVD since Fit TV no longer carries his workouts (or any workouts for that matter). Nothing can compare to Gilad's exercise programs. Just what I needed to get rid of the extra 5 pounds.,1313712000,,197,4.5
3883665,5,B002ACJ3GS,"Gilad has always been my choice workout.  I watched his TV show on FitTV for years until Comcast got cheap and took off all the good stuff.  Having the Hawaiian ocean behind him is part of the pleasure but mostly it's that the workout is worth doing.  Because I did his program so faithfully in '06' my muscles have the 'memory' he speaks of and after months of not doing anything I notice tone returning after even 3 workouts.

This DVD is an excerpt of a couple of his harder workouts.  I could always tell on his show, when they wore their red and black outfits, that the workout was going to kick my butt, so I'm glad this DVD includes those types of workouts.  It's pushing me to get back to where I was 5 yrs ago.",1311206400,,719,4.173913043478261
3883666,5,B002ACJ3GS,Gilad is one of my favorite workout instructors.  This is a solid toning routine that includes a middle section of cardio.,1285286400,,122,4.809523809523809
8359198,4,B002ACJ3GS,"Gilad was one my first ever video instructors!  I used to do his workouts back in high school (we're talking late 80s) when they were shown on ESPN.  Although I still use video workouts almost every day (now DVDs and YouTube), I have moved away from Gilad over time, mainly because there's so much more variety available.  But I had an opportunity to try this DVD, and I thought it might be fun to revisit with Gilad for awhile.

""Peak Performance"" is one of three total DVDs in Gilad's ""Total Body Sculpt Plus"" series.  (I haven't tried the other two.)  The two workouts on the DVD were obviously taken from his TV show, but it must have been full-hour shows, as the workouts are about 45 minutes long each (minus the commercial breaks).  There are cuts in the routines where the commercials would have been, which is understandable; however, I wish they had done a better job with the editing, as the workout often picks up after the ""break"" with Gilad already in the middle of the next move.

Both workouts--Show 1 and Show 2--have sub-menus that list Warm-Up - Sculpt-Part 1 - Cardio - Sculpt-Part 2 - Abs and Stretch.  Gilad teaches live in a beautiful Hawaiian setting with four background exercisers (two women and two men).  I have broken down each of these routines in greater detail below.

***SHOW 1***
The simple 4.5-minute warm-up starts with steps side-to-side.  Gilad introduces some basic boxing moves, such as a step forward-back with a jab-cross.  Additional exercises include hop side-to-side, twist side-to-side, and a twist with a ""shot put"" throw.  The first sculpt section begins with light weights and curtsy lunges side-to-side.  Gilad gradually goes deeper, adding arms and pulses.  He then holds the curtsy lunge to one side, adding a pulse and arms overhead.  Next, he uses a resistance band for bicep curls.  This section finishes on the floor with side plank and a side plank scoop/curl.  I liked the cardio, which was all boxing moves and about 11.5 minutes long.  Gilad builds on a step front with a jab-cross, eventually adding a knee lift, jab-cross to the side, and an upper-hook-cross series.  He finishes with jump rope moves before repeating the entire series on the second side.  The next sculpt section (11m) includes side lunges, adding a pulse and arms, and chair squat.  Gilad also performs additional planks, adding a one-leg hold.  Additional floorwork includes a one-leg hamstring hold, elbow plank hold, and reverse plank.  For the Abs and Stretch segment (about 5.5m total), Gilad starts with a basic upper crunch, adding legs and quickening the pace; he also performs a double crunch with legs in-out and side-to-side.  The quick (2m) stretch includes a lunge twist and breathing, for a total workout time of about 44 minutes.

***SHOW 2***
This routine places a bit more emphasis on the lower body (with the exception of the boxing cardio).  The warm-up contains slightly different moves but is similar overall.  The sculpting is different in that it starts on the floor.  Gilad does a LONG side-lying series for the outer thighs, and OUCH! he works that area good.  He finishes this sculpting section with some push-ups.  The boxing is also similar to the first workout in that Gilad builds up a boxing combo, this time with jab-cross plus uppercuts.  The second sculpting section again focuses on the legs, this time with standing work for the outer thighs and glutes.  The abs segments is good, with some one-leg work, and the final cool-down stretch to fnish is quick.  This workout also comes in at about 44 minutes total.

Overall, these were very good workouts with nice variety.  There isn't all that much upper body work (even in the first show), and I'm not a big fan of planks, but the DVD provides two solid 45-minute workouts for those in the advanced beginner to low intermediate range, and I would recommend it.",1526256000,,3876,4.835866261398176
8359199,5,B002ACJ3GS,"I enjoy Gilad's workouts, but I do not like the pauses where commercials were part of the tv program. (There are no commercials in the workout just brief interruptions.)",1507420800,,169,4.862068965517241

8359201,5,B002ACJ3GS,This a great video and the best one that I own.  I really like the fact that it is divided up into two workouts and you do not have to do the whole video.  It is a good workout for the whole body. I would highly recommend this one.,1485388800,,231,3.693877551020408
