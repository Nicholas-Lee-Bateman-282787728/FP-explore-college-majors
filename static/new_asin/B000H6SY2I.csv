2629292,5,B000H6SY2I,It came in a timely manner.  Price was right.  My grandchild loves watching these and this is his bedtime treat every nite.,1207958400,,123,4.545454545454546
2629293,4,B000H6SY2I,"I didn't even know there WAS a Mario cartoon, much less several seasons' worth. My kids love anything to do with Mario and Luigi and with a longish commute to school, this makes the drive much easier for my kids and me.",1189728000,,219,4.238095238095238
2629294,4,B000H6SY2I,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid, then they changed the characters and that was it for me. I'm glad to see it was available on DVD so I can share it with my kids.",1178928000,,172,3.4358974358974357
2629295,5,B000H6SY2I,"I bought Super Mario Bros Volume 1 for my 9 year old son for Christmas and he liked that so much, he wanted Volume 2, which he enjoys just as much.  At first, he didn't like the ""live"" part of the show.  But as he watched each episode he now thinks the ""live"" portion is really funny.",1174780800,3,284,3.9649122807017543
2629296,5,B000H6SY2I,"When I heard that this series was being brought to DVD, my heart stopped.  I could not believe that this great series was coming.  I got volume 1 instantly and couldn't wait for volume 2.  I was not disappointed in the least bit!  This is one series you have to get if you love Mario Brothers, the cartoons based on them, or just toons from your childhood.",1168300800,4,356,4.268656716417911
2629297,5,B000H6SY2I,"Hey Pizanos! It's the Super Mario Bros Super show! Sound familiar to you? If it does, great! That just means that your ready for season two of The Super Mario Bros Super show. Mario, Luigi, and Toad are back to save Princess Toadstool and themselves out of the evil King Koopa's hands. There are all of the remaining episodes on this disc except for four.

2629298,5,B000H6SY2I,"SMBSS LOVE IT BUT WHERE IS THE REST!, January 21, 2006

loved the Super Mario Brother's Super Show when I was a kid and now that it is comming to DVD that is great news. My only concern is that it doesn't include all 52 shows! What happen to the rest is there going to be a future release that the die hard fans can get I sure hope so.

This is what I wrote as my in my last review for the SMBSS volume 1 release and I excited to say that my complaint has been solved and I could not be happier. Preorder now this could be a hot item for christmas.",1159833600,2,548,3.7982456140350878
2629299,5,B000H6SY2I,"First off I have to say is there have been rumors that 4 episodes would be missing off this set beacuse the entire run consisted of 52 episodes and Shout was only releasing 24 shows to a set which would come to 48 shows, 4 missing!  The rumors are half right!  Shout fought hard to include the entire 4 missing episodes but could only put the cartoon portions in as bounus episodes due to problems beyond their control.  Rest assured that all of the regular 24 episodes will have their live action counter-parts!

2629333,5,B000H6SY2I,"I bought volume I of this DVD set on the advice of a friend.  My five-year old son loves his Super Mario Brother wii games.  Last month, we were flying to India (a fifteen hour direct flight from New York), and I was desperate to buy him a new DVD that would provide a distraction during the long, long flight.  I had never even heard of this show (must have missed its run in the 1980s somehow), but my friend told me that her five-year old loved these old cartoons, and suggested I make the investment in the boxed set.

I listened to my friend, popped in these DVDs as soon as our flight took off, and my son was riveted.  During the entire two weeks we traveled through India, he kept asking when we were going to be flying home . . . because he really wanted to get back on the plane so he could watch his Super Mario DVDs again.  These DVDs made a trip that I had been dreading for months into a treat.  And since we've been home, he insists on watching at least one episode a day.  Even my two and a half year old daughter likes to watch, which means that we've drastically reduced the fights over whether we're going to watch Dora or Spongebob during our evening hour of tv time.

So five stars for becoming a beloved fixture in my household.",1304553600,,1250,4.175
2629334,5,B000H6SY2I,"Although I got this DVD set from another location, I loved the show.

If you grew up during the time when this was on the air and enjoy the various Mario Bros. games, get this DVD and get ready for some nolstalgia",1275523200,,328,3.9545454545454546
