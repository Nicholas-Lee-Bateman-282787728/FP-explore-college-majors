However, when you bring together a jury of some 15 aficionados, including two who have never seen the work before, and therefore have no preconceptions, three who ""disapprove"" of the unconventional approach adopted by the director and several seasoned opera connoisseurs who appreciate the courage needed to give the staging such a thought-provoking slant, a unanimous verdict is not possible.

As our video reveals, the debate after the screening was, at times, quite heated. It is indeed, asking quite a lot of audiences who know and love this opera, to accept the idea of tuberculosis being replaced by cancer, and Mimi dying in a hospital bed before the orchestra plays a single note... The ""saving grace"" was of course the quality of the singing and playing which made this production musically superb and did draw almost unanimous praise.

In the end, quite a few members of the jury expressed what they felt the director was trying to achieve, suggesting that the all-pervading presence of death in a context we can all relate to did indeed give the story greater depth than the often over romanticised approach we are used to - and that this in consequence made the music all the more poignant...
Here are some of the jury members' written comments:

""I very much liked this mixture of the fantastic (evoking Tim Burton and James Ensor) and romanticism. The orchestra and singers are perfectly in line with this. I gradually got involved and was very moved -- although not immediately.""

 ""Surprising stagng - to say the least! Makes it less romantic than a conventional production, but on the other hand it comes across as more realistic and powerful. I was much more moved by the second half. Interpretation and singing first class. Beautiful images, very well filmed - and the sound was vivid and realistic.""

""The staging makes the story difficult to understand. It is shocking and even quite brutal for those who have actually had experience of the illness (cancer). In contrast, the women's voices were particularly beautiful, especially that of Musetta. Also, the way the sets underwent a total transformation right in front of our eyes was quite staggering.""

 ""Highly original. A way of presenting a very well known opera in a modern way. This approach draws us into the suffering and the environment and the medical care that goes with it. Treating death from our viewpoint is a very interesting idea. The scenes where we see the hospital bed or the patients help us understand the torments of Rodolfo - who loves Mimi while at the same time suffering as he sees the illness and fears death and the inevitable separation... ""

""Surprising, offbeat, even provocative. I had problems understanding what the staging was trying to say by showing both the medical environment of the 21st century and the romantic vision of Montmartre in the 19th century. But despite all that, it does make you think!""

8527907,2,B008H2IIMA,"Thought that it would be interesting to see/hear Mimi die in a hospital. But it was at the beginning and not at the end. It's comparable to reading a book where the beginning is pages 207-281 followed by pages 1-96 or Act 2 followed by Act 1

The direction, to say the least was lacking. Mimi was miscast; she appeared to be in robust health.

The Blu-ray DVD was crystal clear",1357603200,3,377,4.295774647887324
8527908,5,B008H2IIMA,"This La Boheme is a non-traditional production, as those wacky Europeans are won't to do. But it somehow works. Mimi dies in a modern hospital bed before the downbeat, and the entire opera seems to take place in Rodolfo's head. (He's a tenor, so there's lots of space in there.) The cast seems to alternate between modern-day medical personae and their characters in traditional stagings of the opera, almost seamlessly at times.

One bit that I haven't seen before [spoiler alert] is using the same singer/actor as Benoit and Alcindoro (yes, that's often done, but keep with me) AND Parpignol AND the drum major at the end of Act II AND the guard in Act III until he is always on stage. A presence you can't shake. We realize more and more that he's Death. He's Dr. Miracle, the Serpent, a male version of the Loreley. He's Lon Chaney.

Although some of the modern medical scenery and props were a little intrusive, I have to commend all the cast on their total commitment to the concept. Poor Rodolfo, in addition to two high Cs in the first act, has to live through the lingering death of his most beloved treasure every night in a traditional production, but in this production he has to do it in two eras and I don't know how many levels of reality! Still, the stentorian tenor Diego Torre was more than equal to the acting challenges, and his high notes rang beautiful and clear from beginning to end. I'd love it if his middle and low had been as consistent as his high voice.

The women in the cast acquitted themselves admirably. As a ghost from the very beginning, Mimi had challenges not encountered in most productions. Marita Slberg was vocally and dramatically committed in this, her first Mimi. Alternating between the ghostly figure in hospital garb and the bewigged seamstress of 19th century Paris did not interrupt her beautiful and expressive singing. As Musetta, the lovely Jennifer Rowley, a fan of whose I gladly admit to being, was all spitfire and sultry vocalism. The Toledo Blade recently wrote of her Musetta at the Toledo Opera ""Musetta [was] played to the hilt by Jennifer Rowley, a young and robust soprano who shamelessly stole every scene she appeared in -- just as it should be."" I can not say less about this portrayal. 21st century tart or 19th century tart? Did it matter?

Supporting cast was pretty darn good. The Schaunard of Espen Langvik and the Marcello of Vasilij Laduk were  beautifully sung, and I must say I've never seen Schaunard fighting with Marcello for Musetta before. (I have seen Schaunard and Colline as lovers, but that's a different story entirely.) Although the Colline of Giovanni Battista Parodi had occasional intonation issues, I would highly recommend hearing him again. The choruses, both children and adult, deserve praise for rhythmic accuracy (it's not an easy opera to sing chorus in!) and for acting. Conductor Eivind Gullberg Jensen rallied the forces quite ably, and kept everything paced quite appropriately.

I hope you have an opportunity to see this production. We are all richer to have it available to us on DVD. It might not sell you on concept productions or updating in general--and I'm still not sold--but it might make you think about La Boheme in an interesting new way. Which is the idea.",1357430400,8,3273,4.773851590106007
8527909,5,B008H2IIMA,"This version of La Boh&egrave;me is on the New York Times list of gift ideas as a `Must Have', so what better opera to pick for a first time viewing. If you know the story of La Boh&egrave;me then you will be somewhat puzzled when the stage opens onto a modern oncology ward with Mim&igrave; attached to a heart monitor. But Stefan Herheim is a producer who is intent on making his audience think about an opera and its meaning, and in this version of La Boh&egrave;me he certainly achieves this aim in bucket loads.

Before even the first notes of the overture have started Mim&igrave; dies and Rodolfo is distraught. What follows is a potent mix of now and then, the modern and the traditional Boh&egrave;me, to Puccini's fantastic score. Yet it is all so skilfully woven together with scene and costume changes taking place before your eyes as part of the opera that there is no confusion, just a deep empathy with Rodolfo as he struggles with his grief at the loss of Mim&igrave; from the great killer in our time, cancer.

The singing by everyone is superb, but a special accolade must go to Diego Torre (Rodolfo) who maintains his confused, grief-stricken countenance superbly throughout. The orchestra is well conducted by Eivind Gullberg Jensen, the music supporting the singers and never overwhelming them, leaving you to enjoy both at their very best.

Would I recommend this production of La Boh&egrave;me from the Oslo Opera House and Stefan Herheim? Yes!! Would I watch this DVD again? Most definitely, if only to see the superb staging and choreographed scenes changes!",1355443200,4,1583,4.833948339483395
8527910,4,B008H2IIMA,"The first notes you hear in this 2012 Den Norske Opera production of Puccini's La Bohme are the beeps of a heart monitor on a life support system that Mimi lies attached to in a hospital bed.  The beeps take that familiar flatline tone as Mimi breathes her last and doctors rush in to the opening chords of the score proper in a vain attempt to resuscitate her, while Rodolfo looks on aghast, completely lost in his own grief.  This evidently isn't a traditional way to start La Bohme, but it is very much a typical Stefan Herheim touch where the standard linear approach is just not an option.  As a director, Herheim is clearly interested in getting into the minds of characters whose actions and motivations we can take for granted from over-familiarity, and La Bohme is a very familiar opera.  Not here it isn't.

Having established that Mimi dies - which, let's face it, even if you weren't familiar with the opera, her fate is signalled clearly enough by Puccini right from the moment she totters and stumbles into Rodolfo's garret, often with a hefty tubercular cough for good measure - Herheim is more interested in the impact her death has on Rodolfo after the opera ends, considering the times and the troubles they have shared together.  His grief played out in flashback then - the hospital ward opening up to a more traditional view of the past in Rodolfo's Parisian garret - the past and the present coexist for Rodolfo, who has no means of pulling them together.  When he poses the question 'Qui sono?' to himself here in Act I then, it takes on an entirely different meaning, one that involves real soul-searching, as well as a certain existential dilemma.  Compressing and overlapping time in this way simultaneously concentrates all the joy and happiness of that fleeting moment of beauty, while forcing one to consider how brief and vulnerable are the flames of love on those candles that are so soon to burn out.  It's indescribably sad.  I'm usually a wreck by the end of La Bohme, but I was shattered already by the end of the first act here.

Evidently however, the absurd modern twists on an otherwise faithful staging can be a little off-putting or will be simply intolerable to some viewers.  Already in the first act, Mimi collapses, her wig is removed to reveal a bald head that bears the signs of chemotherapy (this Mimi is dying from the rather more contemporary killer of cancer rather than the traditional old-fashioned disease of tuberculosis), and she is ushered back into that modern hospital bed that looms at the corner of Rodolfo's consciousness.  The shifting of the off-kilter sets from one 'reality' to the next - incredibly well designed to transform so smoothly - have an unsettling effect not only on Rodolfo but on the viewer also, leaving them unsure at times about what exactly is going on, and why the familiar figures in the work don't behave in character in the way that we expect.  Rodolfo here is so impassioned that you get the impression he believes he could bring Mimi's ghost back to life by the end of the opera.  Wouldn't that be something?  But no, Herheim stays faithful to the intentions of the work.  ""Per richiamarla in vita non basta amore"" - ""Love alone will not suffice to bring her back to life"", he says in Act III.  It's all there in the libretto if you want to look for it

Surprisingly, it's all there in the score too.  If you consider that Puccini's writing here can be extremely manipulative and has a tendency towards heavy pathos, sentimentality and schmaltz, Herheim's staging forces you to listen to the music in a different context, and the effect is phenomenal.  The performance of the work itself is overall also very good, the added dramatic twists only intensifying their impassioned delivery.  More so Rodolfo than Mimi, it has to be said, Diego Torre singing the role superbly, with consideration for the different nuances of meaning applied to his character.  By focussing the attention on Rodolfo's state of mind and resigning Mimi to little more than a ghost however, the consequence is that it weakens Marita Slberg's contribution to the work, but she sings it well in the context.  The other characters are also reduced to relatively minor roles, but even if it loses some of the contrasting elements of the nature of relationships that is brought out by the Marcello and Musetta pairing (adequately sung by Vasilij Ladjuk and Jennifer Rowley), the tightening of the focus isn't necessarily a bad thing in this work either.  Svein Erik Sagbrten's recurring Death-like presence as the landlord Benoit, Parpignol, Alcindoro and a Toll gate keeper could also be seen as bringing more of a consistency to the colourful but marginal episodes of the work.

On Blu-ray, the production looks and sounds as good as you would expect from a recent HD recording.  The singing sounds a little echoing in both the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes, but I found that the stereo track sounded much clearer through headphones.  The recording and mixing of the orchestra however is gorgeous, with lovely tone and detail in the orchestration.  It's a good account of the work - Eivind Gullberg Jensen directing the opera for the first time - attuned to the performances and only slightly adjusted in one or two places for the tempo and tone to match the production.  There are a few very short interviews on the disc (around a minute each) with the director, conductor and cast, done backstage in the intervals presumably during a television broadcast of the live performance.  The BD is all-region, with subtitles in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Korean.",1353024000,11,5653,4.796907216494845
