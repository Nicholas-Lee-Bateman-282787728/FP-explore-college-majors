Also, a note: the opening theme song is addictive, but the sequence that goes with it makes it look WAY more serious than it is. Buy this series! You can even watch it with your kids if you want to :)",1379808000,,346,3.887323943661972
8300403,4,B001F0TT42,"I picked this up to add to my collection expecting to toss it aside half way through. Psh! I was hardcore incorrect! While definitely cartoony with absolutely no direction, its totally hilarious!! I laughed out loud almost every episode!! And I was sad when it came to an end!
Its cartoony, so to say there is lots of action, it isn't like your gonna critique a fight scene or something. Its silly action, but there is always something goin on!! Always! If Miki isn't fighting with her nemesis, a crazy little pug (I wish he was my dog), she's getting challenged by a dude who challenges her every day until she remembers his name. Her only weakness...her mom, cause she a bad mammy jammy!! Be stompin craters and bustin people in the chops...
Hey, kid safe too!! Miki doesn't flaunt her undies once!! Just an evil bunny in a bathing suit a couple episodes. No bad language.
Its a lotta fun yall!",1365206400,,896,4.537037037037037
8300404,5,B001F0TT42,"This is like an animated Three Stooges except there are more regular characters per episode. Some of the things I mention may contain spoilers so read no further if that is a problem.

The story is about a young woman named Miki, she works in her mother's ramen shop as a waitress and delivery girl. She is also a brute of a person. If she can get through one day without beating a person into submission, screwing up a delivery or spilling a customers order at the shop, it is a good day. The story is mainly about her almost mystical martial arts ability and all her challengers or restaurant competitors trying daily to beat her in some kind of fight, failing hilariously in the process. Throughout the entire show there is only one person who can best her in a fight and that is her mom. If random comic violence is your thing then this show is for you. Unlike a lot of more recent shows with comic viloence, this one does not cater to 'fan service'. There are no ridiculous upskirt shots or random topless women to be found here. If that is what you are looking for, then keep looking elsewhere.",1355788800,,1100,4.392156862745098
8300405,4,B001F0TT42,"Some anime are not designed to be particularly heroic. There are those that lack giant robots, magical powers and epic destinies and instead follow the lives of average people moving from day to day.

Ramen Fighter Miki accomplishes this, in spite of itself.

The basis of the story is Miki the Ramen Stand Girl, a twenty year old who passes her days as a waitress for her mother's restaurant with the odd delivery here and there. However, the rest of the cast tend to make things more epic than they are in real life through the usage of random martial arts duels that range from Train-inspired finishing moves to vicious attack dogs. Yet, despite all of these random attacks and violence, this show never gets beyond the fact that these people basically have simple lives and have normal day to day problems despite their best efforts.

Honestly? This show is pure, cheap crack that has no point and really doesn't try to. The opening sound track is the most epic element to the whole production and is more ironic than anything. I enjoyed it because it amused me, but don't go into this expecting something mind blowing or ground breaking. This is just the sort of Anime that is silly enough for a drinking game without having a plot that the consumption of alcohol will make things harder to understand. So if that doesn't matter to you, go ahead and pick up the silly crack and enjoy!

HINT of a SPOILER

The main character herself is much more entertaining when inebriated. :)",1352505600,,1482,4.641221374045801
8300406,3,B001F0TT42,"I saw the first couple episodes of this show at a convention, and they were extremely funny, so I decided to look it up. After seeing the fawning reviews here I snapped it up immediately, thinking I couldn't miss! I was wrong. This anime is often funny, no doubt about it. Every once in awhile it is even hilarious. But be warned - this mindless slapstick can get old really quickly when it's choc full of re-used sequences. The same punch line gets beaten to death in nigh every episode! Ramen Fighter Miki is certainly not something you can watch a lot of in one sitting. Most episodes will have you rolling your eyes at a brief sequence that simply isn't funny, and that's Ok. Others, however, will have you staring at the clock, wishing you could get the last 20 minutes of your life back.

So yes, this anime is funny. For the price, it's probably worth it. Just don't blunder into this series like I did, expecting comedy gold; you'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment. This a bizarre and offbeat series, and it will hit on some episodes, and miss horribly on others. Some sequences will make you wince - you just have to be prepared for it. I might even suggest that if you want to watch it with friends, watch it yourself first to pick out the parts that are actually funny, instead of just cringe worthy.",1280707200,,1326,4.45679012345679
8300407,5,B001F0TT42,"This show revolves around the zany antics of a ramen shop and its poster girl,  Miki.  In a way this is the show in a  nutshell.  It's a show about nothing.  If you liked other shows of this kind like School Rumble, you'll like Ramen Fighter.  It never takes itself seriously, and in fact it works better in some ways than School Rumble because of the total lack of a romantic angle.  No messy drama to bog down the comedy.  This is all strictly fun and games.

This might be a downer for some.  However, the fact that you don't have to really keep up with any pretext is really what drives the show.  It's just a show that puts it's protagonists in some oddball situations.

The main role falls on Miki, a young exuberant poster girl from a ramen shop her mom  owns.  Miki does most of the menial jobs  around the restaurant, something she just can't seem to finish on her own.  Her problem being that she tends to wonder off, usually into some random trouble, causing some disastrous effects on her tasks.  It doesn't help either that she tends to pick-up fights at random, and in fact, most people comment on her propensity to be a bully, especially to those around her.

It doesn't help that other people get in her way.  There is Megumi, an opposing poster girl from a bakery across the street.  Toshiyuki, a menacing dog that seems to be the only living thing that can stand up to Miki.  Nishiyama, a man trying to get revenge for the awful things that Miki did to him in his youth.  Her mom, Makiko, and the one person Miki truly fears.  Then there is Ohta, a neighboring shop owner that loves the TV series Star Ranger (think Power Rangers and you get the idea).

The story isn't too complicated and it works more as a formula to get these characters in a comedic situation.  It works, and it works wonderfully.  The show is 12 episodes long, and it comes in a subtitled format.  No English audio, so if this is a deal breaker I would recommend skipping this one.  Even though there is no English dub, the Japanese cast is spot on.  It's just funny hearing the characters scream and cry at any little situation that they find themselves in.  Even funnier are the facial expressions and the big drops of sweat that appear.  Somehow, every comedic element is spot on.  It's really just a funny show.

It's short lived, but what we do get is just a sweet selection of stories to enjoy.  You'll be hard pressed to find a short series of this nature at this price.  It won't be for everyone, but to those that appreciate dumb humor, this is right up your alley.

Good purchase!",1271548800,4,2580,4.380549682875264
8300408,4,B001F0TT42,"Ramen Figher Miki is an extremely hilarious anime! It doesn't have a plot, nor does it take itself seriously for the most part, but all it's about is 3 mini stories in each episode detailing the different aspects of what it means to be a Poster girl for a Ramen shop (even though she does anything BUT deliver ramen).
This is strictly an action/comedy anime; there arent' any tearjerking elements or anything else. If you have watched other comedy anime such as School Rumble or Ouran High School Host Club, you will most DEFINITELY enjoy this series!
The only complaint I have about this anime is that it's too short; 13 episodes is nothing, when it could have gone so much farther. But aside from that, this is recommended for all who can use a laugh.",1238198400,,753,4.544117647058823
