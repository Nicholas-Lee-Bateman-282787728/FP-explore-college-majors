6517196,5,B00M0DTYUW,"i am dying literally dying! to see this in the highest quality possible of recent years, i grew up watching this show in spanish, so the voice actors were from mexico and being honest the best voice castings ever made are not american made are the mexican ones, these people create voices that stick to you and feel timeless, i never saw sailor moon in english and i'm really glad because after growing up listening to the mexican dub i would have felt completely dissapointed by the english dub, which is terrible to say the least. And i'm truly glad they are redoing the voices, this way they show will feel like a whole new experience for everyone and one with greater quality than ever before, this is one of the best news of the year for me!",1407715200,11,746,4.413043478260869

6517202,1,B00M0DTYUW,"All i can say is: Are you kidding me?
THIS show is for teenagers?
All sailor moon does is cry about anything that she doesn't like.
Some superhero.
Tuxedo mask always have to save her.
And she can't even do anything herself.
If i wanted to hear a teenage girl crying like a big baby,i would've got a job babysitting.
Also,it gets old that all Japanese anime shows always make their cartoons wear red white and blue outfits and make Americans look like they all eat like PIG'S!
I'm seriously offended.
Plus,these girl's wear too short of skirt's for 14 year olds.
Plus,this show is pretty nasty even for teenagers to watch.
A boy lifts a teacher's skirt on this version of the show and doesn't even get punished for it.
I don't recommend this show to anyone.",1517270400,,757,4.492753623188406

6517222,4,B00M0DTYUW,"Similar storyline BUT different screenplay way different video.  Like ""R"" VS Crystal
related stories BUT alternate versions of the story; this makes a 3rd story version
and the Crystal is better executed but with apparently better graphics.

As with Black Arch in ""R"" vs Crystal similar stories but alternate versions
same characters, same objectives, similar devices BUT different video and much
different screenplay.

Simply: same basic story but retold much differently.

on the DVD's and BR's I found the 4X3 TV format with thick side boarders to fake as
16X9 movie format, no way to make these skin-fit in a window while doing other
stuff, those thick sides simply will not disappear.  I docked 1 star cause this is
unnecessary and prevents full-screen playback.

New Voice Actors

6517241,1,B00M0DTYUW,I am a Sailor Moon fan. I loved the original Dic and Cloverway dubs. I planned on buying this just to support Sailor Moon. I cannot justify another purchase of Viz's Sailor Moon release because of the poor quality product I received. I do not know if this problem has been rectified. If it has I just might reconsider. My  DVD didn't skip or anything. The image quality and audio quality is rather poor. If I didn't know any better I would have thought this was a bootleg. I love the DVD cover art. I don't care for the new dub at all. The video jumps in some episodes. I recommend buying this anyway if this is the only way you can obtain a legal copy of Sailor Moon. I hope the quality of the Sailor Moon Crystal DVD and Blu Ray release is high quality. What a shame. Ranma 1/2 is older than Sailor Moon and I heard the quality for Viz's release is excellent.

6517243,5,B00M0DTYUW,"When I found out that Viz Media acquired the rights to Sailor Moon and were redubbing it, I was shocked. It was a dream come true, one of the most treasured anime of my childhood was back. I immediately had to get it so I purchased it here on November 11, 2015 and don't regret it. I got the DVD only version but didn't matter. I remember the first time Sailor Moon aired in the US in 1995 on Toonami I fell in love with it. Now 20 years later, I am reliving my childhood. Like some other reviewers have said, the new dub is great and fits the character. I was initially surprised that it was using the Japanese character names instead of the English names in the original DiC dub. The Japanese dub option is still there for those who prefer the Japanese dub.

I have both parts of season 1 and both parts of Sailor Moon R. Watched through all of the episodes and am very satisfied. Another plus is that this is the uncut version so the stuff that was edited/removed from the DiC dub has been restored from what I can see.

If you love Sailor Moon and wish to add a classic anime by today's standards, get this.",1468627200,15,1111,4.186915887850467

6517248,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I have been an avid fan of Sailor Moon for nearly two decades. I have waited so long for an uncut version that is faithful to the Japanese original and here it is! I love everything about it: the pictures, the sounds, and even the English dub sounds great (though I am more interested in watching it in Japanese with subtitles). I am so happy! This release does NOT deserve any of these negative reviews.

As for the picture complaints: I have not noticed anything wrong with the picture. I am not a film expert though, so maybe I am just not seeing it, but I honestly think it looks great.

Now, as for the new dub complainers: The hard truth is: Get over it. Plain and simple. If you gave it a one star because you ""want the old dub"", you are truely missing the point and laying blame on the wrong people.

1. The rights to the old dub are forever in limbo and can never again be aquired because of copyright law. No way around that. Not Viz's fault they could not aquire the rights.

2. The old dub slaughtered the original context and words of the true Japanese version. I was heartbroken when I found this out and have been hoping for a ""true to the original"" cut. They didn't even dub all the episodes. Even if rights could be attained, there would be full episodes that would need new voice actors to dub the episodes and it would sound very strange to have different voices for different episodes.

3. ""Well, they could've just brought the old cast back"". No, they couldn't. For one, union labor laws would have made it complicated and costly. And for two, those women and men are in their mid-40s to maybe even early 50s now. They would not sound the same.

I have fond memories of the DiC dub, it's how I was introduced to Sailor Moon. I do think fondly on the former English dub voices. Honestly, going back and listening to the old dub after watching it subtitled in Japanese, I thought it sounded weird because I got used to the Japanese voices. If so many others can give it a chance and get used to the new voices, so can everyone else. Giving this amazing release a 1 star because you won't let go of the past is not fair. Laying blame on Viz is not fair. You are allowed to be mad, but put your anger toward who's to blame, and it's not Viz, it's copyright laws.

Okay, rant over. Bottom line, great release. It's 100% worth the purchase. It's a dream come true! Thank you Viz!",1463097600,9,2394,4.29490022172949

6517252,5,B00M0DTYUW,"As a fan of Sailor Moon, I have watched every season and episode very much as any fan girl would. I love the nostalgic feeling I feel when I listen to the soundtrack and how my daughter now eight years old is excited about watching Sailor Moon. Their are very few shows I allow her to watch now in days and even more so ones that I don't want to watch with her. Sailor Moon is one of the ones that brings back that family environment for us. This company has done a great job in matching the Japanese version very well. Many of the themes and stories are quite similar so I am really excited about learning more about these seasons that I didn't have the time to watch with the japanese versions! The voices are little hard to get used to. A lot of people complained about the american dub voice actors released back through dic. I personally thought the first season voice actor was really good. It wasn't up until the 2 or 3rd season (the one with the aliens) that I thought it was weird because she sounded to old for her age. The voice actors are really good at what they do in this dub, but I would like to make a note that I don't feel like they have as much energy. For example, when Usage does her transformation scene, it seems more boring because the voice actor is just not as energized as what I am used to, other than that everyone did a great job.
Sorry this review is long, but I wanted to make sure everybody got all the details of this as possible. A lot of people are complaining about the animation piece itself. Granted, I have only watched four episodes so far, but I have not see an issue and their was no issue from what my daughter told me (who is usually a bit to honest in my opinion about things.) Overall, for 24 bucks I think it is definitely well worth it. If it would of been 100 dollars I probably would have been upset, but for 24 dollars this is the best deal you are going to find in order to get Sailor Moon episodes without youtube. I plan on purchasing more of the dvd's. I will keep my post updated if I notice anything that is out of place. On an extra side note:",1461801600,9,2103,4.1442542787286065

They re-dubbed the whole series, this means they were able to make changes like fixing the names back to the originals rather than the Americanized names they had put it.  They fixed Zoicite (sp?) who was never meant to be female.  I was bouncing all over the house when they called her Usagi rather than Serena.

I'm so excited by the fixes to the series I'm off to buy the second part of first season right now!

Thanks to the efforts of re-dubbing the dialog was fixed and in multiple instances things make so much more sense.  Also there are multiple episodes that I never saw aired here in the US, many of which help to explain why things happened the way they did in later episodes.

This is still the same story about a klutz who became a super hero but I feel as if I'm seeing the whole story now rather than just watching a cliffs notes version.  Can't wait to see the next set.",1458345600,3,950,4.297752808988764

But when I saw this, I got it for the nostalgia, being a 90's kid. I've already watched the entire first two seasons multiple times. This set has the first half of the Dark Kingdom arc. ViZ nailed the voice-acting. Each actor fits their role perfectly. A lot of other reviewers have complained about the quality, but I have not experienced that. There are only a couple of scenes that are blurry. It is worth noting that only a handful of episodes were adapted from the manga (only the pilot, Sailor Mercury's debut, Sailor Mars' debut, and the Princess Diamond episode). All of the others were written for the show, and while they can be called filler, they are well-written. I am deducting a star for this set being in 4:3, as all the others are in 16:9.

6517271,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I want to give this 4 stars because the Blu-Ray/DVDs are well done and matches the Japanese show as totally uncut and other cool stuff people go nuts over.  Even the voices are better than the original 90s version.  It really should be 2 stars because the show itself sucks.  For some reason I enjoyed this show better when I was 10 years old.  It does not age well.
The other issue with this it has six discs, yay! but when you look closely three are blu-ray three are standard DVD.  Ugg!!!! So it's only like 27 episodes.  DBZ blu-rays have like 40 episodes and are priced much cheaper.
There was no need t break this up as part 1 and part 2 except for a pure money grab.  They you're trick with them saying it's six discs because you think it's going to have tons of content because blu-ray holds more space.
I'm splitting the difference and giving it three stars.",1453852800,,867,4.314814814814815

She was very excited about the gift, but when we started watching it, it was nothing like the VHS versions we used to own. It was a little disappointing! The VHS (which we purchased back in 1995)  had everything in English even the Theme song was in English, However on this DVD (and the other two sets I purchased) everything was of course in Japanese. Even when we put it on English settings the songs and text were still Japanese, but at least the voices were in English.  Still wished we could have heard the Theme song like we used too!  Aside from that the picture quality was good. We got the combo pack and watched on Blue-Ray and Regular DVD. The sound was really loud and crisp, no problem with that!  It was fun watching this series together, and now my little sister is enjoying Anime like I did when I was her age. Good Price for the Combo pack in my opinion.

For the most part, I don't see it, but it's very noticeable in the intro to episode 2, and there is sometimes evidence of it when pausing as well. But one must ask themselves if the good parts of the set outweigh the bad. For me? YES. The packaging on the set itself is gorgeous (if you get the Limited Edition). The booklet has some nice artwork and the chipboard case glistens with a beautiful sheen. Also, the new English dub is both serviceble and COMPLETELY UNCUT, unlike the DiC and Cloverway travesties. Also, be aware that when watching the Blu-rays on a 4:3 television (it's all I've got), the video will run in a window. This is also not an issue with me; since the picture is smaller on the TV, it looks like the quality is better than it actually is. Lol",1449619200,,871,4.253012048192771

6517282,4,B00M0DTYUW,"This review pertains to the Blu-Ray release. After years of waiting Sailor Moon finally gets a remastered Blu-Ray release in North America. Contained within the very pink box which will, eventually, hold all 45 episodes of Season 1 on a Blu-Ray/DVD combo are the first 26 episodes of season 1. Our story focuses on 14 year old Usagi Tsukino who after rescuing a cat named Luna with a crescent moon bald spot is gifted a transformation brooch and is told her destiny. That destiny is fight the evil threatening the Earth and to find the Moon Princess and the other Sailor Guardians. Usagi is hardly thrilled as she is scared, emotional, and would much rather snack, sleep, and just enjoy being a normal girl.
  But enough series synopsis onto the review of the remastered video and completely new English dub. I admit not knowing the technical aspects of the video remastering but it cleans up well in HD on my PS3 and the colors are vibrant and details in the background are clear. Previous releases the color was very washed out and background details were not very visible. The new English dub from what I have heard so far seems spot on and since this translation is uncensored and truer to the original it is almost like watching a completely different series. (It has also been over 10 years since I last watched the series.)

Remastered Japanese audio is also included. Bear in mind this is NOT the original censored dub from the 90s so you will be disappointed if that is what you are looking for. Nor does it have any of the voice actors returning though some such as the Voice Actor for Sailor Jupiter have been given the blessing of their predecessor. Overall I would say if you were a fan of the original be it the Japanese or English I would say it is worth picking up for the loving treatment it has gotten. Is it a perfect release? I'll say no but the new dub and video clean up are a huge improvement cost and quality wise over the lackluster boxsets previously put out by AD Vision.",1445126400,3,1998,4.513812154696133

Viz Media did an OUTSTANDING job redubbing a beautiful anime I have loved since 1999. I just don't understand why so many people are making a big deal about the quality.

6517294,4,B00M0DTYUW,"When I first heard that VIZ media was going to bring back the original Sailor Moon tv series on bluray and dvd I was very excited. As a child I enjoyed the version that DiC released back in the 90s. However, certain things in their version were edited beyond belief. For example in season 1 certain episodes were completely cut out entirely (I was shocked to find that Sailor Moon had more solo episodes than were originally aired). So, VIZ's version of Sailor Moon is the complete unedited and unaltered version of the series.

Some surprises you'll be happy to notice are; there is a whole new English dub and I must say that the cast is indeed superb. Usagi actually sounds like a Junior High School Student and Zoisite is voiced by a man in this version. Second, they keep the original Japanese names for all the characters so it will take some adjusting to and finally all the sets include the original music which is always great to hear.

Just a word of caution: There really is no difference in quality between the dvd and the bluray. I played both the bluray and the dvd to see how they did in comparison and there really is no difference. So, If you think the dvd set is more affordable go ahead and get it you'll still receive the best quality. I certainly hope VIZ decides to release the films. Those I would love to see in bluray format.

I'm so happy Viz finally released this and I can't wait to get the rest of the series.",1439856000,,1438,4.378277153558052

As a fan from the 90s, loving these new actresses, they're doing the guardians justice, representing age demographic and the script is now more mature, translation closer to original japanese subtitles. part of me wishes Toei would have given VIZ a higher quality video which is not VIZs fault. Part of me wishes VIZ was allowed to update the original japanese audio but it allows one to enjoy the anime in its original form so many thanks for this awesome release.",1438387200,,490,4.709302325581396

If you were expecting the version that was on Toonami in the 90s this is not it. However it is still a must have if you were a fan of the series. This was my first anime I ever watched, I use to watch it with my sister. This was the gateway into anime for me, Then I got into series like DBZ, and Gundam.

The reason why my rating is so low for my favorite anime show is not because of the quality like everyone else is complaining about in the reviews. Although, quality isn't an issue at all. My problem with the DVDs are simply because of the voices! The voices are extremely  off from what we seen on television! Like Molly's famous voice is so no longer she sounds regular and Luna's voice is weird if you knew how she once sound. Another thing is the names. Serena is no longer, her name is Usagi. I can get past the issue of the names, but the voices I can't! The voices are completely absurd. I hate them passionately, because I love this show and the voices of the character are what matter most. Although, you may think that I'm over exaggerating, but once you actually because I would think the same thing as well, but the huge difference is completely unsatisfying.

For all the complaints about the picture quality, we are not videophiles but can generally see obvious faults in discs. We did not see any of the ""problems"" that have been mentioned by others in reviews and were thoroughly pleased with this set. The only issues for us was the black bars on all sides which didn't truly hinder our watching the show, and the accurate translation removing ""meatball head"" from the dialogue.  On the plus side we love the new dub, everyone sounds wonderful in their new voices and the show itself looks clean and vibrant again.

I was never attached to the original English dub so the decision to redub the series with a new cast to restore edited scenes and story lines didn't bother me. But the wave of issues regarding ghosts, over saturation and blurring had me concerned. I finally opted not to get the BluRay but instead bought the DVD.

1) there is little shaking in the video as it plays (though the shaking doesn't effect how much I love this product and I'm sure this happens when processing an old animation)
2) different voice actors. Finding this out is a little upsetting considering I fell in love with the original voice actors and changing this brings this down to a four star review. No doubt the voice acting will be better as the seasons progress to be released.

Overall, I still love the series as it is and I'm excited to see that there is a few episodes that I haven't seen before considering they weren't released when the show came out originally. I recommend this product so much. I love the fact that the picture has black bars on both sides and the rough look on the picture.

The colors really popped more than watching the older episodes online; and finally, the original Japanese anime with the appropriate English subtitles in a Region 1 format for DVD!!!! I grew up on Sailor Moon, and it is so good to see it again. I prefer the original Japanese to the English dub, both old and new, but I was still happy that Viz out the new English dub on the DVDs. Comparing old and new English dubs, I really enjoyed that the new dub stuck more closely to the original Japanese and I grew to like the new Usagi's voice. I actually prefer the old Serena voice, and I like the old Darien voice better too. I'm not too crazy for the new Luna voice, being that it can seem monotone at times. Overall, I am extremely happy I went ahead and purchased this DVD set! I highly recommend it for old and new Sailor Moon fans alike, and I hope that they make DVDs for all of the Sailor Moon episodes for all arcsin the original Japanese!

6517313,4,B00M0DTYUW,"I just bought the first episode on iTunes.

It's really cool that the remade English version is totally replacing the censored 90's edited little kid's version. Nothing is changed, everything is still original. All uncut, Original artwork for the beginning theme song is original, not messed with, Character names are original. Usagi, not Serena. When Usagi originally gets called bun head, not meatball head! Luna is not old, the one episode with the music having evil subliminal waves is there, Zoisite is the gay effeminate male (not dubbed as a straight female to make it little kid friendly), the final original two episodes of the final battle with Queen Beryl (where in the 90s edited kid version they combined those two episodes into one and took out the fight scenes and violence.). Everything is still original in the Japanese story, just English dubbing.

I'm unsure about the voice actors, they're okay so far, not bad. I'll have to get used to it.

Honestly, for $29-$30 this is a great deal for how many episodes you get in this set compared to the older DVDs and VHS. I bought mine from Wal-Mart because it was the cheapest I found. My two children, 2 and 3, actually enjoyed watching it with me because it was in English. Usagi, is still a cry baby but I loved watching this as kid and still do. Remember, it's from the 1990's, it's not perfect because that was how it was made. They actually cleaned it up a bit and it's brighter than I remember. If you want to enjoy a part of your childhood and get your girl power on with a talking cat. Sailor Moon will definitely bring a smile to your face. Can't wait till Pretty Guardian comes out for USA, in English, so my children and I can enjoy that as well. But you just got to love this classic my moonies!",1426982400,4,927,4.0989010989010985

They promised a Digitally Re-mastered version of the original sailor moon...and what I got was very low quality Blue-Ray. I showed this to my friends and compared it to an old VHS version that was produced by DIC and The DIC 90's tape was a better quality than this Blue-Ray!!! THAT'S ALARMING!! I want to support Sailor Moon and all of its properties but if a big name company like Viz isn't going t show good support and charge extra Money for a product that doesn't have HD Quality like they have Promised I may not buy products from them in the future. I have been a loyal fan of theirs since the 90's.

If your going to get a good quality old school magical girl series that is 1 digitally remastered and 2 have good quality sound and slightly better dubbing you might as well purchase the Card Captor Sakura On Blue Ray You get the whole series for the price you pay for 1 season from Sailor Moon.

6517344,3,B00M0DTYUW,"When I first heard it was announced, I was really curious about the new dub. And then, on the week of 11/11/14, a lot of negative feedback hit the posts on Facebook, and other places on the Internet. As a result, I decided not to put on my Christmas list, concerned that it would be a waste of money on my family getting it. I decided to wait till later.

When I decided to buy it at a F.Y.E. (For Your Entertainment) store, I DID know what I was getting into after reading that feedback. And looking back on it, the video issues were there from the beginning, even on the Neon Alley/Hulu versions. Besides, I have experience working with ripping clips from BD and DVDs (for personal use, not piracy), and using the clips in Adobe Premiere, where I can edit video to create parodies and comparison videos between the 90s DiC dub and the 2014 Viz dub. I simply could just move the replace the ghosting clips (when possible) with the clip before or after the affected clip, which somewhat easy to do, considering that anime in general are usually stills, and are more static in movement, compared to American hand-drawn animation.

I do not know if this is Viz's fault or if it's Toei's (the original creator, who sent the masters) fault for the quality of the remaster attempt. It's also a little too early for them to do a replacement program on the DVDs, since it was released in November. Maybe in the future they will change their mind on the whole thing, but they're just getting started with releasing the show here in the USA. Also, you've got to remember that this is a pretty old show from the early 90s.

So ultimately, it comes down to this: If the video quality is going to be an issue for buyers, then that discourage people from buying it. If you can overlook the issues or use Premiere or some other video editing tool to fix the issues, then you could buy it.

On the bright side, thanks to Viz, we are able to enjoy what ADV could not do when it released the uncut versions of these episodes in 2003: a brand new and better English dub! If Nozomi Entertainment got it, we wouldn't have this dub! So thank you, Viz, for re-dubbing Sailor Moon!",1423180800,3,2158,4.401002506265664

Same animation, different voices? If you didn't grow up watching the original like I did on Cartoon Network/Toonami you will be ok; but if you did expect a shocker.",1422921600,3,340,4.328125

this is truly epic and like seeing the show all new with the new dubbing.
if you LOVED the original english episodes you will fall in love again with the enhanced images, accurate names and better translations (which makes the story make more sense). also love they didn't change Zoicite to a woman, no more ""sailor says"" and more importantly the story is accurate! no more translation problems!

I also want to say that; I hope this goes on sale in the UK, even though I can order this through amazon.com. NOTE: if you're living in the UK, buy a multiregional Blu ray/DVD player.

But, it's still worth buying, and don't regret buying this.",1422662400,,491,4.444444444444445

6517351,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I love watching this with my daughter. I never watched the American version before this dub, so I don't have the complaints that other viewers have with the voice acting. I have read to skip the HD/ Blu Ray version and get the plain DVD, so I did. Excellent quality.",1421884800,2,266,4.34
6517352,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I'm really loving the update to the series. I know several people are gripping about that the quality is still bad but come on guys this is an old series for it to be up to speed for Bluray quality you would have to redraw the entire series. The black bars are easy enough to ignore in my opinion since I'm not looking at them I'm watching the anime in the first place. I love that the colors have been tweaked slightly it definitely gives a new feel to it. I do like that Usagi sounds more like Usagi I do hope her voice will get more mature sounding as the series goes on because she does get more mature. Luna's voice will take me some time to get used to since she sounds so different from her original actor.

But all in all this is a great series and yes the features aren't fully worth the money you are paying for the combo. I think $40 would be much more acceptable for the series. I'm a person that doesn't generally get Bluray stuff just because my family only has one in the entire house and I don't have a game system that can play them either. I do wish they would have given the DVD set a nice box as well but that's what happens I guess is the Bluray gets all the awesome stuff now. At least once all the series have been released we don't have to worry about it anymore since the prices keep getting higher on them since they know we are going to pay it.

Despite all this I still get the series because this was my first anime that got me into anime in the first place and will always hold the #1 slot as my fav anime until the end of time. Don't listen to all the nitpickers this series is good no matter how you look at it they are just trying to cause trouble and if you are a fan of the series as much as I am you can overlook it because it's as bad as they are making it sound trust me.",1421539200,4,1809,3.967032967032967
6517353,3,B00M0DTYUW,"When I saw this DVD set at Walmart I freaked. I took a photo of it and posted it on Facebook. My dad saw my post and bought it for me for Christmas. I wanted to like it so much, I really did. This isn't the worst thing ever, but you have to understand. I was OBSESSED with this show back in the mid 90's. I collected every doll, the wand, the locket, and was Sailor Jupiter one Halloween. Yes, I was a teenager, but shhh, don't tell anyone ;) Fast foward to the year 2015 when I'm in my mid 30's and have a 6 year old daughter. I put the DVD on, so eager to show her the awesomeness that is Sailor Moon, and found myself slightly disappointed, o.k. maybe a little more than slightly. I'm not a tech geek, or anything like that, and I've only just started the 2nd DVD, but I could hardly care about picture quality as long as it looks the way it did when I watched it in 95'. No, my problem is that Luna has a young voice. The opening theme is in Japanese, when I very very much wanted it to be like it used to be here in America in the 90's. Call me a nostalgic fool, but I can hardly stand that she is Usagi and not Serena. And Tuxedo Mask....uh, not nearly as awesome when he doesn't call her ""meatball head"" I'm not sure yet if this series will go into the awesome battle scene with Queen Beryl, but I might cry when I do see it. I mean, seriously, I was such a dork, I memorized that whole episode and would act it out. I loved every thing about this series and now I just feel like I'm being teased with this beloved show that I used to love so much. I don't hate this DVD, but I'd like it so much more if it was like I remembered. One thing I can say is that my 6 year old daughter who had never seen the DIC show really seems to love it. Sigh. If they would make one EXACTLY like what I remember, I'd buy it in an instant.",1421366400,5,1829,3.893048128342246
6517354,2,B00M0DTYUW,Was thrilled to get this box set home and begin watching.  The quality of the BlueRay discs was very good at first.  No complaints about the video or audio but...  Unfortunately half way through disc 2 the video went a bit crazy and the screen started flashing back a forth with between the video and the snow you get when there no reception.  Thought it might be my player so tested on another player with the same result.  What I did not real yes until later was it is not a defect of the disc...there is a virus on the discs I received.  My BlueRay player will longer function properly and goes snowy frequently.,1421366400,,615,4.350877192982456
6517355,3,B00M0DTYUW,"Don't get me worng, I love this show, but the DVD is formatted widescreen and has black bars hard encoded on the left and right sides. Since this is an old show, I wanted to watch it on my old school crt tv cuz it would feel more natural to watch and the nostalgia would be awesome! Unfortunately, it didn't work like I wanted it to. Like I said earlier since the left and right black bars are their and hard encoded into it to make it widescreen, my TV makes black bars on the top and bottom so the black bars look like they are forming a box around the image. This would be fine for the bluray release since bluerays only work on HDTVs, but for a DVD release? Come on! Why didn't they take the left and right black bars out, and give us an old school 4:3 full screen image!? Its literally a common practice!!! DVD's are ment to be displayed 4:3, for wide screen its anamorphic. Meaning its compressed to 4:3, then streached by the player or tv. Why Viz decided to not take out the black bars, idk, but that's 2 stars off for that as it gets  annoying!!! Other then that, the show is awesome, and dispute the display problem on the disk, the dubing is awesome, the show is just worth the money! Might be a bit girly at times, but it's still awesome! But if viz makes a new release that fixes the problem, I'm trading this version for that version as the black bars suck and the screen should be filled up on a 4:3 TV, the 4:3 saying on the box is kinda deceiving reason is pretty much what I said. By all means though, I say do not pass up on this awesome anime! Its a very good classic along with dragon ball z and yu yu hakusho! I highly recommend this show! Its just 2 stars off for the black bar issue.",1421280000,,1707,4.095522388059702

6517359,3,B00M0DTYUW,"Ok so let me start by saying I LOVE SAILOR MOON since i first saw it back when toonami was awesome and so was t.v in general...LONG LIVE THE 90'S but alas this bluray release left me with alot of mixed feelings, and thats not a good thing to say when its regarding a silver crystal of a gem as pretty guardian sailor moon. 1. Let me say that the video quality on bluray was a good job and i really think videophiles as myself will NEVER be fully satisfied but like i said VIDEO was a good job, The dvds on the other hand left ALOT to be desired. 2. The AUDIO is where i felt viz dropped the ball big time...for one the english dub is either good or or horrible and thats about it, unfortunately here its DECENT some actors sound better than others and others (im looking at you tuxedo mask) sound generic or just flat. And the backround music might have been great by the 90's standards but lacks energy thats why i appreciated FUNIMATION choice in the dbz and tenchi muyo OVA to allow us to chose the japanese backround music or the american backround music heard during the toonami run. Just look at cowboy bebop and yes sue me but in terms of english dubs the music and dub enchanced what was already there...a great anime. Here in the pretty guardian sailor moon anime...it just seemed like a rushed attempt to cash in on the momentum created by sailor moon crystal, which im my opinion is a great return to sailor moon. Thats just my humble opinion and you don't have to take my word for it and i understand that its thier first attempt at thier new roles and hopefully they improve with time and i hope the same for the music. But i won't hold my breath as is sailor moon on bluray gets a solid 3 out of 5.",1421107200,2,1712,4.206686930091186
6517360,5,B00M0DTYUW,"As a 15 year veteran of Sailor Moon I really loved this! To finally own a nicely done copy of Sailor Moon as my very own is just amazing. I still cant believe it actually happened. Yes like many others I am nostalgic for some of the old voices of Sailor Moon but I`m really appreciating the fresh new voices too. Usagi`s new Eng voice is so adorably perfect, I just cant get over it! I know they really tried to get someone that sounded like the Japanese voice and I think they did a pretty good job. Her voice is the one I worried about the most because she is the main role but also because its not easy doing a whiny crybaby without being super annoying, but Stephanie did a beautiful job. I noticed some people were really upset about the picture quality but in all honesty I didn`t see anything wrong with it. For an old 90`s anime, the colors were nice and bright and the picture ( to me ) looked clean and crisp. Of course I`m not a professional at things like that so unless the quality is super blurry, I wouldn`t be able to tell. I think they did a wonderful job bringing new life to an old anime and that`s not easy to do. If your worried about all of that but absolutely LOVE Sailor Moon, then I would encourage you to keep an open mind about it and don't be unrealistically picky. This is a NEW  beginning for Sailor Moon not a rehash of the old. For the kids who are now watching this version, these are the Sailor Moon voices that they will grow up with and become fond of. Thankfully the Sailor Moon they will come to know won't be all cut up or missing episodes or changing voices midway through the series. These are all good things so I encourage you to watch it as a kid again and just enjoy the fact that Sailor Moon is finally here. So if your a Moonie like me who has been waiting a long time for Sailor Moon restored, with a fresh new dub that will last through ALL 200 episodes, and made available to you in a pretty pink box on DVD and BLURAY. Then this gift is for you!",1420848000,7,1996,4.1179487179487175

6517363,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I am genuinely perplexed with all of the negative reviews. After reading them, I braced myself as I began to watch the DVDs... and I simply cannot fathom where all the hate is coming from. The picture quality is superb, the sound terrific, and the new dub is wonderful. Finally, a legit ""Sailor Moon"" that has not been censored, kidified and cut to ribbons! I watched on a Blu Ray played on a HD TV and I never saw any of the flaws mentioned in other reviews. No artifacts, no ghosting. Again, I thought the picture was beautiful, with bright, vivid colors. Having said that, I do understand how the fixed 4:3 aspect ratio might bother some. But that's a minor quibble. At least the picture has not been cropped and stretched for widescreen, which is something that happens to quite a lot of programs nowadays made before 16:9 became the standard.

6517364,4,B00M0DTYUW,"I've loved Sailor Moon since I was a child. I have grown to love the Japanese voice cast and version of the show so much more than the original Dic horrible dub. I grew up with the Dic dub and absolutely loathe it now. I was super horrified at first when I heard the new dub, but I actually like their voices, it's so much better.
The DVD/ Blu Ray set was not done well. The remastering looks terrible. I want to like it, but I can't. I'd love to be happy with the way it looks, because I love how it sounds...
I think it's worth buying if you're a fan, the voice acting is great, and you can still put it back in Japanese if you hate the new cast, it's also nice to have an officially released DVD set.

TV's.. Best to watch it on smaller screen or on laptop if you have any real issue with size.. On the plus side it has the missing episodes that were NEVER seen when it was on T.V. and is better translated and uses the Japanese names.. My advice to you is ignore the haters that been giving it bad reviews for no reason I could find and suggest make up your own mind but I for one had no complaints given how old this series is...,1420329600,,632,4.064

Maybe you have to look harder or I'm just not very observant? The picture quality was really, really good for an anime from the early 90s. I'm really excited to have an official Sailor Moon release and I look forward to buying all 5 seasons.

The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars is because I'm not crazy about all of the voice actors they chose. You get used to it, but there are times where Sailor Moon's voice is slightly annoying and too cheesy. I was reading YouTube comments recently and someone said how they liked how distinct each characters voice in the original DIC dub was. I agree, I liked that, but maybe that's just my personal preference because I grew up with those voices. I had the same issue when they redubbed My Neighbor Totoro. The voice actors they used with the DIC dub are the only thing I liked about that dub, though. I'll take this new, uncut/unedited VIZ dub any day!",1420156800,4,1056,4.443298969072165
6517370,1,B00M0DTYUW,What a joke the dub is just awful to say the least. I bought this for my sister who is a die hard sailor moon fan and I honestly couldn't believe the terrible job viz did with the dub and music. I felt so embarrassed to hear the dub/music that I wanted to throw the DVD in the trash where it belongs. If I knew it wasn't the dic dub I'd never have wasted a cent on this garbage. Here's hoping dic releases sailor moon how it's supposed to be.,1419897600,5,442,3.922222222222222

I love that I got to see episodes I had never seen before.
I love that i walked into my walmart...saw it on the shelf...and could buy it.
before today the only official dvd i owned was from 2002-ish...all my dvd sets are $30 ebay bootlegs....so I was EXCITED to put money into the legit thing....and it not cost me hundreds for an english dub.

the new voices I hated at first...but they have now grown on me.

by no means does the visual quality fit today's standards.....but i actually enjoy it's rough look (looks better than my vhs) it feels nostalgic.

I feel that viz did really well with what they had to work with....not disappointed",1419811200,5,658,4.421487603305785

And theirs differences like instead of serena and darrien its usagi and mamoru. All the characters have their japanese names now just little things its still the same episodes just different voices(: lol and it weirded me out when darrien (mamoru) called serena(usagi)  bunhead instead of meatball head. Its not the same as the original dub but its good enough and will do for my SailorMoon addiction.<3",1419638400,2,544,4.978021978021978
6517374,5,B00M0DTYUW,"Please pay no mine to the critics who give this anime a 1 star. When clearly its a a 6 star show. And why do they give it a one star there excuse is that the design of the anime is not up dated. May I remind you people that this is an old anime and of course the the animation, color, and the design is old. Though I have a few episode of  the organelle and this version is clean nice and the best picture I've ever seen for Sailor Moon. Of course the Japaneses dub is perfect though the English is not as good but I never liked the English version to began with. I LOVE Sailor Moon since I was a kid even though I was never allowed to watch it. My parents wouldn't let me watch anime until I was 12. But i never thought I would be able to own it. Even on Blu-ray. Its the best the picture is clean and the audio is clear and the subtitles are a lot easier to read.

If you wanted to watch a movie or show were a princess fights evil with her guardian friends. And the Disney Princesses weren't making you feel heroic. Then this anime is for you. Though The Brave, The Frog Princess, and Frozen have a strong female characters but if your wondering were Disney got there idea of the Design of Elsa watch season two.

Sailor Moon is about a normal middle school girl named Usagi Tsukino who is all was late, a cry baby, and clumsy who also makes bad grades. In fact we are a like we even share the same birth month. Though I don't and didn't make bad grades when I was her age and I was never late. Even though a lot of times I wanted not to go to school. Usagi finds out that she is a Sailor Guardian from the moon and is to not only to protect the human race but also find the Legionary Silver Crystal and protect the Moon Princess. If you know this series then you already know or if your  new to the the series but have already figured out who the Princess is. If not, I won't spoil it for you. Usagi finds this all out by helping a talking black cat with a  crescent moon mark on her forehead named Luna. Not only dose Luna help Usagi but also helps find the rest of the guardians. Ami Mizuno is a cleaver and the brains of the team and she is Sailor Mercury. Rei Hino is a pretty hot headed girl and makes fun of Usagi/Sailor Moon and she is Sailor Mars. Makoto Kino has unbelievable strength and easily falls in love and she is Sailor Jupiter. Minako Aino is a witty and happy girl and is Sailor Venus. All five girls must fight Queen Beryl and her Men Jadeite, Nephrite, Zoisite, Kunzite, with there endless monster from plugin the world in to darkness.  With all that is a good thing they get help from a masked man named Tuxedo Mask. That Usagi has fallen in love with. But is he friend or foe. But in the end good will always win.

Best Anime that I will ever own and cherish forever. Its a funny, magical, romantic, and action show that I will never get tired of. Especially the songs and lullaby. I'll be humming it everyday.",1419552000,8,2937,4.070934256055363

6517377,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I really don't understand the amount of complaints about the video quality. Sure, it's not flawless. But, for a show that is 22 years old, it looks great. And compared to every previous release of Sailor Moon in the United States, it looks downright fantastic. I like the booklet it comes with, though I wish there had been more information about the episodes than just a minor blurb. I absolutely love that this is released in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo set.

My biggest complaint is the same complaint I have with other Viz Blu-Ray sets (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranma-1-2-Set-1-Special-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B00GSTHBS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranma 1/2 - Set 1 (Special Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] release): the subtitles are ridiculously hard to read! The text is small (not tiny, but it could stand to be bigger) and completely white. It often blends into the background so much that it can barely be read. I can't watch more than an episode or two before having to stop because my eyes hurt.

I know that it's possible to have great, readable, non-invasive subtitles on blu-rays. I've seen great subtitles on other releases from other studios. But Viz constantly chooses this terrible font, terrible text color, and ridiculous size. As excited as I was to finally have a fully *uncut* release of Sailor Moon in the United States, I'm not sure I'll continue buying the series if the subtitles remain this painful on the eyes (same goes for Ranma, another series I really love).

Another minor complaint is that the special features on the box set are almost entirely U.S. centered. I don't care about the dub recording or the announcement video. I want to watch the Japanese special features from the laser disc releases! I'm hoping we'll see more subtitled Japanese special features in the future.

I would have given the set four stars if the subtitles weren't so terrible.",1419379200,2,1926,5.223300970873787
6517378,5,B00M0DTYUW,This DVD is great!  I recommend this to all Sailor Moon fans.,1419379200,,61,4.083333333333333
6517379,4,B00M0DTYUW,"I don't usually do reviews, but I wanted to do my own honest assessment and make a review to help others make a purchasing decision.

I have been a fan of Sailor Moon ever since the dub was released in the US in 1995. We never got the rest of the R series or S, SuperS (until much later), and never Stars. I would print out the synopses from the Hitoshi Doi website (does anyone else remember that?) since I could not watch the episodes from Japan.

Around 1999, I went to a comic book convention where someone was selling some bootleg versions of the 3 Sailor Moon movies (which had not be licensed in the US yet), and I was in love. The Japanese version was soooo much better.

The first time (as far as I know) that Sailor Moon was legally available on DVD was the ADV releases. The first season came in a HUGE box and cost $200. It was so expensive that I could not afford to get the R season when it also came out for $200 in a similar huge box set.

Later I did get the S and SuperS series by Pioneer on DVD, but Stars has yet to be licensed until now. I also have the box set of all 3 movies from Pioneer, and I wonder if Viz will also be releasing the movies and the Ami's First Love mini-special.

I bought the Viz Blu-ray and DVD set in a heartbeat, since it would be nice to have all the episodes in similar box sets. I took a look at it, and it didn't seem perfect, but after comparing it with my ADV DVDs, it was a big improvement.

While trying to find the Amazon page for part 2 of this set, I was surprised by how many stars and how many bad reviews there were for this DVD set. So I decided to take another look at my Viz DVDs, my ADV DVDs, and the Viz stream episodes for comparison, and here's what I have found:

*There is some ghosting that is very apparent in the opening song and anytime something is light colored and fast. That being said, it doesn't happen often, but it is a bummer for anyone who likes the opening. (On the other hand, ADV has weird lines in all the episodes.) Ghosting is also apparent in the Viz streamed episodes, so maybe it shouldn't have been a big shock. I have been religiously watching the Classic streaming on Hulu and the quality has been fine. If the DVDs are basically the same, then I don't have that much of a problem. I have also been watching the stream through Roku on a 40 inch TV and it looks great.

*The sound quality on the Viz DVDs are muuuuuch better than the ADV DVDs.

*Light colors on the Viz DVDs can look grainy and overprocessed. I should have known because even the ""announcement trailer"" Viz published is a little grainy.

*The ADV DVDs episodes ""shake"", which doesn't happen in the Viz DVDs.

*The ADV DVDs also have black bars on the side, since Sailor Moon was never shown in widescreen. It's fine to me. I don't see what the big deal is.

*Sometimes lines are a bit blurry from being overprocessed, but I haven't really noticed until now while trying to look for them.

*The ADV DVDs came in a huge box set and cost $200 for 1 season of DVDs. The Viz release is in a smaller, cuter, more manageable box set and will cost about $100 for 1 season of DVDs AND blu-rays.

Overall, I think the Viz DVDs are not perfect, but when it's something from the early 90's which was never produced in stereo, it can't be 100% perfect. I have decided that I will continue to purchase the rest of the sets as long as what I see in the Viz streaming episodes is to my satisfaction. My images I have added, the first one is the Viz DVD and second one is the ADV DVD of the same scene in the same episode, for comparison.",1419292800,133,3583,4.136690647482014

6517383,5,B00M0DTYUW,"Some of the reviewers who posted here simply do not have their facts in order, on this release. 1) Viz media was given an HD print, not and Sd print. 2) the remastering Viz did was for English dub, and subtitles. 3) viz requested an SD print and was denied by Toei...stating a good SD print did NOT exist. The print that was struck for the HD versions for Estonia, and Italy IS the print Viz received. This was remastered into Hd from a newly struck enhanced and cleaned up print from the original negatives. These SD prints were destroyed, after the Hd negAtives were struck. Toei then cleaned up the picture quality, and audio quality to the then tv standard, and brought them up to full HD.  The black bars complained about were actually put in by Toei Animation, so Viz cannot remove them. Viz wanted a SD version for dvd release, and through technical enhancements, to remove the black bars.  Some of the ghosting, and double images were caused by duplication, not by anything Viz did. When duplicating the equipment either slightly sharpens the image, or softens it. The sharpness causes the ghosting and double imagery. If the image was softened instead the video would look slightly distorted, and fine lines would disappear.  These image problems are inherent in a SD print enhanced in HD. They can be minimized not eliminated, in post production and duplication. 4)Viz did strike an SD print for dvd release from Toei's HD print. Viz did a wonderful job minimizing problems with this type of work. They should be applauded, not criticized. 5) Viz and Toei overall did very well with upgrading Sailor Moon, congradulations",1418860800,8,1631,4.776595744680851

6517387,5,B00M0DTYUW,"Very happy with the quality of this Sailor Moon boxset, so I do not understand why so many fans are disheveled about the quality. When I was rewatching it, I couldn't help but mention how GOOD the anime looks compared to what it used to be. No more jiggly-screens, the colors were beautiful, and the dub IS AMAZING. Granted, since I grew up with the original dub, it took some getting used to (considering I still called Usagi 'Serena' or Mamoru as 'Darien'). The only nitpick I will mention is some times a coloration of an object disappears from one frame, but it's easy to ignore.

There aren't very many extras, no. What they did provide, however, gave you a glimpse of the new voice actors that are playing Usagi and Mamoru and you got to see the announcement they did at a couple of anime conventions.

I played this blu ray set on my PS4 so I don't know if that amped the overall quality (Sony has released patches for both the PS3 and PS4 that actually make movies look better) but I was very happy with my purchase and cannot wait to FINALLY own the entire series.

Take it with what you will, I find this set to be absolutely worth it. People originally complained about the price but Amazon sold this set for $50 and I'm assuming the next will be the same deal. ADV sold episodes 1-46 for $100 so honestly, considering what this set actually gives you, I find it to be more bang for your buck.",1418428800,24,1404,4.351145038167939

6517395,4,B00M0DTYUW,"A lot of misinformation has been thrown around about this box set. Mostly about he quality being bad or horrible dubbing. Here is the truth about this set from a reasonable human being.
Based on DVD version only.
GRAPHICS:
The picture quality is great for such and old cartoon. All the colors look vibrant and this is the best I have seen this cartoon look ever. That said, there are a few episodes (maybe 3 episodes) where the quality dips and the image becomes blurry. This is the result of the master film animation reusing animations like the transformation rather than photographing the cells again for the optimum quality. So, this is a problem with the masters, not VIZ. Still, this it the best the show will ever look. There are black squares on the side of the picture to preserve the original 4:3 ratio of the show. It was never widescreen, stop complaining. 8/10
SOUND:
Its the original 2.0 stereo. It sounds fine, voices are clear and the music has sufficient impact. No muffles or mistakes. The english dub is acceptable. The original voice were better for some characters but this version is superior overall by staying true to the japanese original script. No censoring. 9/10
EXTRAS:
NONE 0/10
THE SHOW ITSELF AND PRICING:
Sailor Moon is a classic anime following the Power Ranger formula of the monster of the week. Along the way, the show like to drop bombs and kill off an important character, so the show stays fresh. The rivalries between the girls themselves are quite funny and all characters are likable and entertaining. I got this set for $29, which is about right. Paying more for this number of episodes is unfair. The remaster is good and the show is timeless. Newcomers and fans should not worry about this version because it is the best it will ever be. It's a show from 20 years ago that still holds up today and has been re-released in a great way.
OVERALL 9/10 Not perfect but very satisfied and looking foward to the next Volume.",1417996800,8,1963,4.64367816091954

6517397,4,B00M0DTYUW,"After reading many of the reviews here, and hearing about all the ""remastering"" drama, I felt it necessary to say something as a die-hard fan. I have been with the American version of Sailor Moon since day one (literally, I still have my VHS recording of the pilot episode). That being said, I understand the frustration with new voices, and faulty DVDs that still have the black bar, and all the other technical complaints. However, it's NOT that bad. Like any other Moony, I preordered this set, and danced like a crazy person when it finally came in the mail. I have not watched the whole set yet (I've been watching it with my cousin and it's hard to find time we both have), however, from what I have watched, on a giant HD TV, mind you, it is better than I expected it to be (the blu rays, that is). It is a difficult task to take an early 90's cartoon and make it look good in HD, and I was surprised that it looked (and sounded) as good as it did. It's an old show, there's going to be hiccups, calm down! I have not watched the DVDs (I did not buy it for the DVDs, seeing as I already have the entire series on DVD), but if the black bars are as big an issue as everyone is making them out to be, just know there are ways of aquiring the episodes online (in good quality), and downloading them for your own personal use. With all the hooplah going around about it, I doubt there will be an issue with the DVDs in the rest of the series (maybe on part 2).
Moving on; to critique the dubbing, I would say, not bad, but not my favorite. Having grown up with DIC version, and then Pioneer, it will take some getting used to. I understand the reasons for choosing the voices that they did, but it's hard hearing Luna speak English and it not being with a British accent. However, I will adjust (as I did when Sailor Moon's voice changed three times, and now a fourth), and appreciate the fact that they tried to find people who sound like the Japanese actors/actrices.
My biggest complaint is that they are splitting up the seasons (making me spend more money than I would otherwise). There are five seasons, and you're going to make us buy ten sets? Really? Not only does that cost more, but I have to wait longer too. Sigh....",1417824000,5,2232,4.2665094339622645

6517401,5,B00M0DTYUW,"In the 20-odd years since the franchise began, Sailor Moon and the predecessor Codename Sailor V started as a manga by former pharmacy technician Naoko Takeuchi. Both were primed to become anime, but Sailor Moon won out as Sailor V's anime deal fell through.

Over the course of 5 years in Japan, between March 1992 and March 1997, 200 main episodes, 3 feature films, 2 pre-features short films and a trilogy special release during the SuperS season, which was partially based on the fourth manga arc.

Between its run, the anime was licensed to various countries. But eventually, licenses ran out. It was orchestrated, or at least from an assumed perspective, to drive up nostalgia factor during the 20th anniversary rerelease.

I have seen the English dubbed version by Viz on hulu and I can admit that the critics who trash the voice acting as garbage fail to see the point. I am from a family of artists, with multilingual studies, written word and visual arts as part of my studies, I have learned that a 100% accurate translation in terms of vocal acting and wording of the lines originally spoken in anime is an impossible task that in certain cases, can't be done. But the fact that various episodes that were dropped in the first dub by DiC (later Cookie Jar, then DHX) have been translated into English and dubbed by Viz should be a pleasant bonus to those who had invested in the Japanese DVDs.

Between license runs, the underground of fansubbing was originally the only possible way to see the original Japanese episodes and the translation, which, although illegal, was reason enough for major anime companies within North America to take notice on profitable franchises.

It was originally proposed that Funimation, who invested in the Dragon Ball metaseries, also from the same anime studio as Sailor Moon, Toei Animation, that by popular demand via poll, that they were to re-dub the series to its full extent. However, due to circumstances, this deal didn't materialize.

With the impending worldwide streaming release of Sailor Moon Crystal, a more faithful retelling of the manga, Viz announced they were to do the deal with Toei of translation of both anime versions.

This explanation is insight on the phenomena of Sailor Moon.

The voices aren't as bad. Stephanie Sheh, who has done voices for the Monster High cartoon and was the sole villainess of the Deadly Six in Sonic Lost World, plays the eponymous heroine in both her civilian and superhero form and I admit she captured the pitch just right.

Michelle Ruff, who voiced Fujiko Mine in the short-lived dub of Lupin III, is wonderful as Luna, compared to the DiC dub, which made Luna sound like a very old, Julie Andrews-like nanny.

This dub may fall flat in some spots, but the fact the dub is more faithful than previous versions, is reason enough to go buy it.

UPDATE: I did 4 binge watching sessions as the discs in the first season go 8-8-7-8-8-7 in terms of episodes, doing 4 discs so far and I've got to say, the only annoyance is that the video is rendered\encoded with black bars, but the fact the video was originally 4:3 and that this cartoon is from the early 1990s, I shouldn't expect much from Toei, who realized that the passion for Sailor Moon was not extinguished. As stated in other reviews, Toei had given the HD masters as the SD masters were in no shape for use. I find no problem with the Japanese names, seeing as I use cartoons from around the world as cultural stepping stones to motivate me to learn about culture and language. I don't mind Japanese music as I've been listening to it since I was 10 and I'm 27 and a former colleague of mine noted the fluidity of Japanese language paired well with music, even when a lover's spat broke out. I don't mind the madness of these comparison and usage in motivating education, because teaching and academics is part of my heritage. I was born to teach and I find making it fun helps.

The DiC and Cloverway version are no longer legally releasable so if you were expecting ""Serena"", you are sadly wasting time. If you were expecting ""Usagi"", then I welcome you in faithful translation.

P.S. I am from a family run by two Internet innovators (grandpa worked in fiber optics and dad was a program manager in Microsoft's various departments that involved or required Internet Access)

So, the rating still stands at 5 stars as I can't expect wine from Fijian spring water: with the way thing are, the spring water has been around longer than the wine and if you were to check Biblical records, I'd be right. To be blunt, 1992 was 23 years ago, which was when I was 4 years old and cel animation transitioned to computer hand-drawn only in the last 15-16 or so years. Sure, it will be messy and errors will pop up but that's because it was done by hand in tiny cubicles in short time periods. (Episode 21 will give you an idea of pre-computer hand-drawn workstations.)

I commend Viz for restoring faith in the fandom. Keep at it.",1417737600,6,4980,4.66248574686431

http://www.amazon.com/review/R123Y8PP112G85/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0ETRHG

He/She goes into great detail about why Viz has botched this release. As a UK-based fan, I only got my set yesterday. I can now confirm, that this set is indeed utterly botched!

Right from the very first few frames of the opening credits on Season 1, Episode 1, you can see image problems. They are really truly and completely blatant! Only the blindest person could fail to notice the errors that Viz have let leak through! This is one of the worst remastering jobs I've ever witnessed, and it's all on show, on your lovely new, $60 Blu-Ray/DVD Combo set!

The image is really soft, and in my view, I feel it's VHS-quality soft! This is how poor the remastering is! There is minimal detail on show here, and it really is in no way considered to be of HD or even near-HD quality. Quite what Viz are playing at here, I have no idea. As the opening credits play, and characters and camera movement comes into play, you'll notice hazy shadows like this...

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=98564

Look closely, and you will see outlines of where the action was ""before"" the current scene. This is not an animated ""inbetween"" frame, nor is it a deliberate intent by the animators to show movement or transition of movement. Nope, this is a full-blown screw-up by Viz, due to poor remastering done, from second-rate DigiBeta masters they were given by Toei Animation!

And it gets worse. This kind of problem happens multiple times in the first 22 minutes episode! The show is riddled with these errors, and considering there are 23 episodes, or the first half of Season 1, you are going to get extremely angry, extremely quickly at seeing these errors crop up with alarming regularity in each and every episode. This is not just a minor oversight, Viz really have wrecked this release, in terms of picture-quality, in the worst ways possible.

Yes, they have cleaned-up the prints, from what they claim they originally received. And yes, the prints are fairly good. However, skin-tones are too pink, rather than flesh-coloured, and other bright colours, like yellow, red and blue - of which SAILOR MOON has a huge preponderance of - seem muted or too highly-boosted in terms of the contrast levels.

On top of this, there are scenes in most episodes were the image physically vibrates up-and-down. It's minimal, but it's there and you WILL notice it! Once you do, it becomes incredibly annoying!

The sound is dual-channel mono, and not stereo as is claimed, and that's no great shakes either.

This is a travesty on almost every level imaginable. Despite repeated requests to Viz on their Facebook page, they refuse to confirm with themselves whether Toei did send them the DigiBeta masters we all suspect they were sent, rather than the properly-remastered, and much better looking master prints that exist, and which Toei have let other countries have access too, for their DVD releases, e.g. Turkey, Germany, Italy and Japan. So either Viz don't care that they were missold shoddy masters, or didn't want to pay-up to get the better ones that many have all-but-confirmed exist.

Viz have also refused to state whether they are going to investigate the problems with the AV quality of their Season 1, Part 1 set, and have similarly refused to say whether they are going to attempt to fix the issues at any time in the future! All-in-all, this is simply unacceptable behaviour from a company who seems less concerned about the quality of their work, only on making sure they have your hard-earned money in their pockets, and that it stays there too!

The enclosed book, is nice, but hardly ground-breaking, consisting mostly of a brief episode guide, character files and some designs. It's nice, but I expected better! A thin, cardboard internal box that comes in the set, can be removed, and this is where Season 1, Part 2 - out in February 2015 - will eventually sit. There will then be at least eight more half-season sets to complete the entire SAILOR MOON saga!

One issue that DIDN'T affect me, which many have reported, is the fact that the DVD's that come with this Blu-Ray/DVD Combo set, is that my DVD discs output in full, correctly-formatted 4:3, with black bars on the left and right only, of my 16:9 TV screen. Others have reported that they get black bars on the top and bottom too, and this results in a tiny, square image, in the centre of their TV sets. Why this anomaly hasn't occurred on my set, but has on others, is a mystery to me. I checked the DVD's in my Blu-Ray player and my ordinary DVD player, and got the same result. So either the issue only affects early pressings, or Viz has fixed this issue, at some stage. Either way, I'm glad it's fixed, but the AV on the DVD's is equally poor, with colours even more pale and bleached-out than the Blu-Ray versions, and flesh-tones looking yet more pinky.

So, should you buy this set? If I'm brutally honest, then the answer is ""no""! Am I going to keep my set? ""Yes"", I am. Why? Because if I don't, then I may never see the rest of the saga completed, which I really want to own legally, and more than all of that, Viz may just decide that they're going to stop bothering releasing any future SAILOR MOON sets, and simply say to hell with the fans! By keeping it, I can hopefully be one silent voice in convincing them to keep releasing the rest of the franchise, but I can also hope that they will - at some point in time - rectify the AV issues with the first set.

What it comes down too, is your own morales: are you happy to pay for a faulty set, and pray that it gets fixed, or do you take a stand and not buy it at all, and potentially nix any and all future SAILOR MOON Blu-Ray releases?

Whatever you decide, as with me, the decision won't be easy or fun.",1417219200,13,6195,4.642009132420092
6517407,1,B00M0DTYUW,"So where do I start. The anime is pretty awesome but the set is awful. The way they made the 2 parts was kinda weird but other countries are doing it so that's fine. The way they packed it in the case it cheap. The limited edition version comes in a dvd box with the blueray dvd and normals dvd in a case inside, a booklet, and a ""holder"" for part 2. There are a lot of episodes on each disc and when the dvd case is inside of the box it slides out a lot. Besides that, the menu on the blueray is cool, while the dvd version has just a picture of a senshi and 1/2 the features. The quality is the same on both though so they kinda ripped us off there. However the subtitles are horrible. They changed soldiers to guardians. They messed up a lot of lines in each episodes. It is absurd that they did that. The dub's voices are pretty good. There is a lot of ghosting though. Like a LOT. Viz said it would be great QUALITY. But there is ghosting, brighning errors, and bad subbing. They pretty much lied to our face about this set. But sadly we have only this for America. If you can I suggest getting the pioneer sets from the 90's, they have excellent quality but are pricey. I am not getting part 2. Don't bother buying this garbage. The anime is great but the set is awful. Ashame viz won't admit to screwing up.",1417132800,2,1314,4.096899224806202
6517408,5,B00M0DTYUW,"The complaints I've read about this set are ridiculous... I've been a fan of this show since I was a kid and own multiple versions of the show, and this is by far the best looking one. I initially hesitated buying it after seeing countless screenshots on twitter and Facebook showing how ""awful"" the video quality was, but eventually gave in and thought if it sucked I could just return it. Needless to say after popping in disc one this morning I can report that there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it. This set is a quality product that obviously had a lot of effort put into it. Don't let the rage campaign of a bunch of people with too much time on their hands discourage you from purchasing this, VIZ Media has done an excellent job. People are acting like the source material was 1080p or something... it was a 90s cartoon that wasn't even properly archived from the get-go. I look forward to buying all the future sets as well.",1416960000,11,937,4.453488372093023
6517409,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I love this release from the packaging to the content itself. Being in Australia I invested in a multi-regional blu ray player just for this so I was really beginning to worry whether it would be worth it after reading some of these reviews on Amazon. But it WAS worth it, it really was!

While I love the old dub because I grew up with it, this new uncut dub is fantastic once you grow accustomed to the new voices. I love the fact that this dub does not cut out/edit/airbrush scenes and completely change the dialogue - what we get is an accurate translated version, what I've wanted for years.

I know some people have been disappointed with the picture but in all honesty I cannot see any of the flaws they're mentioning - ghosting etc. Like I said, I know I'm not an expert on videos and animation, but I am just impressed with how clear the picture is. To me, it looks brilliant, especially compared to the bootlegs of the old dub/sub that I have. I would buy this again, I really would. I've tried both the DVD and Blu Ray, both were fantastic in my opinion.

This is a great buy for any Moonie, don't let the reviews that criticise the picture quality deter you from buying this, Like I said, I couldn't pick up on anything and what's more is that I plan to pre order every other set too!! Its certainly more than I ever dreamed of to have a legit copy (not to mention a new redub and blu ray) of Sailor Moon. I'm going to really enjoy watching this over and over!

As others have posted in great detail, the video is horrendous, and VIZ has lied and shown little respect to their customers who have asked for an explanation.

6517416,3,B00M0DTYUW,"THE GOOD!!!!:

Presentation 5/5. The box you get is immaculate. Very sturdy, vibrant and made with care. The booklet is equally as impressive. ViZ took their time with the boxset itself.

New Dub: 4/5. Some of the new voices are much improved. Lune, Mamoru, Queen Beryl and Jadeite all sound so much more intense.
The Guardians are...alright. My issue is their voices sound SO underwhelming in spots when it needs to be intense. IE, a fight scene or summoning an attack.

And idk if dubbing over the japanese background music caused some...odd imbalances but again, sometimes the dub voice acting sounds really out of place and just not very strong.

THAT said. Its a great dub. No, its not the old Dic version but that one was only good for the first 100 or so epiosdes until they changed voice actors. At least we'll get the whole series with these voices. Hopefully as the series goes on, the new dub actors will get more comfortable in their roles.

 OH and ANYONE complaining/ surprised the the old dub isn't in this set....like, duh. We've known that months know. Don't base a bad review for this product cause the Dic dub isn't here.

THE BAD:

What in the world is with the aspect ratio?! My Dragonball DVD doesn't do the box thing. My Digimon DVD doesnt do the box thing...just this one. Very distracting.

Also...the ghosting is...really there guys. I'm not a video nut or anything but, shoot there is a lot of ghosting. So much so I have to knock a star off the product.

OH and you cant turn off the subtitles when watching the Japanese audio. Major issue.

OVERALL

Honestly...It's here or there with this guys. The video quality is pretty horrible. It's...not vibrant, small appearing because of the ratio and the ghosting is ridiculous. The new voices are the HIGHLIGHT. Love hearing the new dub.",1416614400,3,1811,4.678233438485805

6517420,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I just received my DVD set and started watching it immediately so I could see just how bad some of the problems I've read about under the reviews are. So far I haven't experienced much of the ""ghosting affect"", what I have noticed is that any ghosting I have experienced with the DVD (haven't tried the Blu-ray) only seems to be noticeable when I pause the DVD. I don't know if it's noticeable to others while the DVD is playing or if they are just leaving out that the ghosting is only noticeable when paused to convince others not to buy, I can only review from my experience but I felt it would be misleading to leave out that I don't experience/notice it while it's playing, it is my duty to provide information that will not stop someone from buying, but to give information to help them make a decision for themselves based on the good and the bad.

I do feel that a lot of the detail seems blurred out and that the color does seems brighter. It's not absolutely terrible in my opinion however as someone who grew up watching Sailor Moon on Toonami when I was younger, I do feel the new brighter images with blurred details does take away from the original feel of the series. Addressing the new English dub with new voice actors; I don't love it but I can't say I hate it so far either. I am used to the old voices and enjoyed them, but I also know there are many fans who even preferred the Japanese voices over the original English dub mostly because they found Serena/Usagi to have a really annoying voice. Those who didn't care for the original voices might prefer the re-dub.

I've only watched a bit of the re-dub so far, but what I can say of the new voices is the overall voice acting is pretty good. My only really complaints about it so far are that I feel the original voices had more power to them, more emotion, and the villains sounded a bit more evil. I feel the new dubs, while decent overall do take a bit away from the feel of some of the characters which affects the feel of the series. It could have been nice if they could have had a 3rd language option where they had the series with the original English audio. I would have also liked for the video to be able to fit the size of my television better. I am not super thrilled with the way the re-release turned out but I don't think it's super bad unless you want to nit-pick at everything.

I loved Sailor Moon growing up and to this day have never stopped. Unfortunately when I was a kid I wasn't able to obtain any of the series on its original VHS or DVD releases and now trying to get any of the original is far too costly for me. So even if I feel this release could have been better, I don't feel it's as terrible as some others might think, but that's my opinion, and again, it depends how picky you are. Right now I am just grateful to be able to watch one of my all time favorite anime series I loved in my childhood again even if it's not in the exact condition I grew up with.",1416528000,9,2967,4.201754385964913

In some scenes I noticed it more than others and I do believe as others have said there are saturation and color issues. It is truly terrible that viz media is taking advantage of fans. The DVD/blu-ray quality is unacceptable i could forgive the ghost images if there weren't so many .You notice the ghost images most when rewinding/fast forwarding. The saturation issues I just cant forgive because its not all uniform people have notice some saturated scene and others unsaturated. I chose to buy the limited edition Blu-ray/DVD and judged for myself, yes i was also sucked in by the limited edition items that came with this purchase.
 The reason I decided to keep this DVD is because I am a true sailor moon fan and i couldn't resist owning a set; that unlike the original will FINALLY have a full voice casting for the entire series .I was born in 92' so I literally had to wait my whole life for this complete voice casting and I decided i didn't want to wait another 20 yrs.

The new English language Dub is amazing, I love the voice acting work and the scripting. I am very pleased to be able to see a dub that is faithful to the original japanese, non-americanized and sticking to the proper soundtrack.

I have no complaints about the video. I know that a few people have been complaining about ghosting and problems with colour but I honestly don't see it. Mind you, I have the DVD not the Bluray. I've watched the DVD both on my computer and my HDTV and it definetly looks a heck of a lot better than the video quality of My ADV films season 1+2 set. The only thing I was able to see for myself was a bit of saturation in certain bright Reds on a couple occasions but that didn't really bother me. I've personally dismiss any claims that involve having to pause it to notice it because that's just dumb. I think some people just have unrealistic expectations about an animated series from over 20 years ago.

If you love the Sailor Moon series and you're not unrealisticly picky about the video, you will enjoy this set in general.

It is so important that a company like this not be able to get away with doing a bad job at restoring something we all know well and have loved for literally decades. If they think we haven't been watching this show any way possible for the past 20 years and wouldn't notice such a tremendous downgrade in quality then they are mistaken. Other reviews go over what these examples are specifically, but rest assured there is at least (1) ghosting [when you can see previous animation from one still to the next] and (2) a blurring of animation details possibly to make it look more ""HD"" by brightening the colors.

I'm so disappointed to be returning this, as I will today. I have been waiting to have a complete, legal, watchable collection of this show since I was allowed to operate a TV on my own. Now I have it in my hands, and it is definitely not watchable.

6517440,1,B00M0DTYUW,"What Viz Media have done to Sailor Moon is a travesty. This is one of the very worst botched Blu Ray releases I've ever seen.

Released as an upscale the quality of the video is in no small words atrocious. Ghosting, DNR put up to 11, color gamma is wrong too. It's ugly as sin and depressingly it needn't had been this way, better masters do exist out there in the world and sadly enough on the BD itself in the form of a clean Opening on disc 3, showing each unfortunate customer of this set just what could have been.

Viz have hyped this release massively and for this to be the outcome with no replacement program on the cards or indeed any change to their so called 'beautiful remastering' is as rage inducing as any Anime fan can imagine.

Especially given the fact that for the very first time the show has been dubbed uncut and it's a good dub too, true as can be expected these days to the original Japanese script. The packaging for this release is also beautiful and all of this ends up being for nowt because nothing, and I truly mean nothing can excuse the video quality of this release.

Do Not Buy this release, It CAN BE made better but not if we tell VIZ that this is acceptable and something we will pay for. Vote with your wallet! I have cancelled my pre order of part 2 and I urge everyone else to do the same.",1416096000,31,1331,4.207843137254902
6517441,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I'm a huge Sailor Moon fan. I've been a fan of the show since it showing up on Toonami when I was 10. I've watched the whole series subbed, I've watched the live-action series from 2004 (which is amazing and it's a crime it doesn't have a Western release) and I've been watching Crystal as new episodes come out.

I was happy to get this and start my official Sailor Moon classic collection. But I just can't enjoy it completely.

Pros:
- Absolutely gorgeous packaging. Sturdy box, beautiful booklet.
- Outstanding English dub. Viz nailed it on casting. This is Sailor Moon, but just in English. No terrible accents, no changes in characterization. It's phenomenal.
- Fantastic audio. Yes, the dub sounds great, but the old Japanese audio from 1992 sounds SO clear. Genuinely a BIG surprise.
- Price. Yes, 23 episodes on both BD and DVD at this price is FANTASTIC.

Cons:
- The video quality is atrocious. Oversaturation, smearing of the image, grain-removal on steroids (It was a show on film. There's grain. That's how it is.), ghosting images, blurred frames, aliasing, and horrible pixel artifacts on lines EVERY. SINGLE. FRAME. It's obnoxious and I can't NOT look at it and enjoy this otherwise outstanding release.

VIZ, you really dropped the ball on releasing a quality product. And your attitude on the matter of being called on your errors is disgusting. Sadly, because we don't have anything better on the market here in the states, I'll be reluctantly giving you my money for the next 9 sets, but that won't stop me from shouting and telling people about your shameful product and company policy.",1416009600,44,1608,4.815217391304348

While I have heard of some negatives on the Blu-Ray version the DVD version seems perfectly fine by me. There is black bars on the side and the Aspect Ratio is only 4X3 but that doesn't bother me. The animation is good and keeps that nostalgia feel, the characters voices might need some getting used to but they'll grow on you (I actually like Usagi's voice actor).

I expected a lot from a renowned company like Viz, the ghosting is horrible, the fact that they forced you to have 2 copies in the box, is idiotic, it's just an excuse to crank up the price! I would have rather wanted to just a buy a Blu ray copy and not blu rays and a damn dvd, but after I watched it on both my pc's and HD TV I can say that I'm extremely disappointed and completely agree with ""anon"" when this person pointed out all the crap that you see thanks to the noob move they did on the encoding, I expected much more quality for the price I paid.

I'm def canceling my second preorder because after listening to ANN's pocast episode where they interview the people behind QC and video management, I have to say that I hope they can go to hell for telling all the people that are complaining about the image quality to suck it up and not wanting to admit they f*up.

How can it be that the Europeans and the Latin American releases are superior to this crap?????? I give up, this is the first and last time I purchase any DVD or Blu Ray of any anime.

People are always complaining that fans should not download or watch anime and to support the industry buy doing it legally, how can I support the industry if the damn fansubbers do superior work on their encoding and translation, how can I not expect a professional industry to do it even better than a fan subber???? it's f*g stupid!!!

The only downside to this is that the English dub leaves much to be desired. Pronunciations are off, example: Mamoru is pronounced MOMoru. The voices just do not match the characters and most of the girls sound the same, there's no uniqueness to the different character voices.",1415923200,,449,5.0

I do like Stephanie Sheh as Usagi, but I still have a love for Terri Hawkes.
Another thing I don't really care for is the size of the actual episodes on the TV. I have to zoom in for it to fit my small flat screen TV. It's annoying.

6517448,1,B00M0DTYUW,"After many years of ADV's cancelled release we finally hear an announcement that Viz is going to remaster the series and release all of it on Blu-ray so obviously I loved the idea, but once the raw video of this so-called ""HD"" remaster was out I noticed that we were upon one of the worst Sailor Moon releases you'd have ever seen.

The picture quality is filled with ghosting, over-sharpened, DNR and so not only did we end up losing a huge chunk of detail from its picture but you also get to see cel from the previous scene because of how badly done this was done. Although, they did use the original Japanese credits so while it's a terrible home release for the English market there's some little good in this as well as English subs and a new dub.

I'm honestly very disappointed because even if you're not what people call a ""videophile"" it's easy to recognise all of its flaws and as such this isn't worth $50. Viz is just scamming people into believing they're making a better release than the original Japanese DVD when it isn't the case.

Avoid this at all costs. It's not worth it and they don't deserve your support.",1415836800,31,1129,4.444444444444445
6517449,3,B00M0DTYUW,"To start things off, I would not consider myself a videophile, but I know good video quality when I see it. As soon as I began watching the first episode I could tell that something was off with the colors. While I don't think the DNR job and saturation on this are nearly as poor as certain other sets (I'm looking at you DBZ orange bricks), they were certainly poor enough for me to notice them. The thing that really caught my eye was the obvious ghosting that I have noticed multiple times just from the first disc. At first I thought it might somehow be something wrong with the TV I was viewing it on, since I have never seen ghosting quite that bad before. Based on what other people are saying though, I doubt it was the fault of the TV.

Video quality aside, I am happy with everything else about this set. I like the packaging and the audio quality and I have been enjoying the new dub. For those complaining that the original dub is not on here, there is no way that Viz could have done it. The original dub by DiC was accompanied by highly edited footage, so Viz would somehow need to acquire the separate video that DiC used and put it on this release. I personally still find nostalgia in this release because it's Sailor Moon, not because of the dub that comes along with it.

If nothing else, this release further proves that American companies are not meant to remaster anime series. Viz has also been releasing Ranma 1/2 on Blu-ray and it looks amazing for a series as old as it is. The difference between the two releases is that Ranma was remastered on Blu-ray in Japan and now Viz is using their remasters for its releases. The same issues can also be found when comparing the Dragon Ball Z Blu-rays (remastered in America) and the Yu Yu Hakusho Blu-rays (using the Japanese remaster), which are both released by Funimation.

Overall, I am still happy with what I have purchased and I plan to buy the future sets. The only thing that really annoys me is the ghosting, but luckily it isn't something that's constantly noticeable. Anyone who really just wants to see Sailor Moon again and doesn't mind some issues with the video quality should be happy with this release.",1415750400,14,2190,4.456359102244389

On a whim, I put on one of the episodes in English. I am a huge fan of the first season cast of the DiC dub, so I was expecting to really dislike the new voice actors. Boy was I wrong. They're wonderful! There are a couple of voices I miss, but they're the exception, not the rule. Stephanie Sheh is especially wonderful. She's the perfect English Usagi!

For a price that is similar to just 1 DVD of the Japanese version, I am able to get 1/2 a season on both DVD and Blu Ray, with a cool little book as well. While it may not be flawless, the quality is far better than any other US release. It looked great on both my HD TV and my iMac. I am a fan of the show. I choose to support the show, and Viz release.

6517455,1,B00M0DTYUW,"I actually refuse to buy this because I have never supported a redub of Sailor Moon, nor have I supported it uncut. Sailor Moon was an anime that was drug over to the US back in the 90s to compete with the male oriented show, MMPR (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) as a girl version of that show and so was geared towards that young audience. Now besides the issues that people have already complained about with the whole video issues and ghosting, etc. the redub issues are a complete slap in the face to many American fans who wanted Terri Hawkes to return as the voice of Serena (or Usagi sorry I use the proper American names). That's disrespectful and the fact that Naoko Takeuchi disrespected her American fan base by choosing very horrible voice actors to redub this. Shoot had Terri Hawkes returned I may have considered buying this regardless of the horrible uncut version and restore of names. The other issue I have with this is I cannot share this childhood memory with my niece because my sister believes the show to be highly inappropriate for her daughter and she would be right if DiC and Cloverway had not dubbed it and censored it back in the 90s but this uncut version only proves her point as there is not only restoration of lost scenes such as the death of the Sailor Guardians in the last episodes of the first season (which I could have lived with that being restored) but there is also child pornography in this, and I dare anyone to say there's not as Serena is what 14-15 years old in the entirety of the series and by US laws child pornograpy is wrong, immoral, disgusting and illegal, which makes me wonder what the hell Viz Media was smoking by not at least censoring the nudity/partial nudity? I think we could all be mature enough to get over a brief censor of such things as nudity/partial nudity. (How did this get by the FCC?)

Also lets get into false advertising, now the thing says we get episodes uncut and redubbed but that should mean that we also get the option to see it as it originally aired in the US but you don't so I don't appreciate false advertisement, which if you read the back it says ""for the first time on Blu-ray uncut and remastered! This stunning limited edition set includes an all-new English dub..."" All of that points to the box set having the original dub on it but it doesn't and I personally hate things that have false advertisements on them.",1415750400,3,2407,4.482915717539863
6517456,3,B00M0DTYUW,"Many have accused this release of being a ""disaster"", and while it's not perfect, it wasn't a wasted effort on Viz's part. Let's start with the bad and end with the good:

The Bad: Yurusenai, Yurusenai!

The footage was aggressively scrubbed of detail via a Digital Noise Reduction process, the colors are over-saturated and the ADV season one set legitimately has better looking video. But it's not unwatchable, and it's not a huge surprise. Dragon Ball Z has been doctored to hell and back over the years in an attempt to make the show look ""new"", it was only a matter of time before Sailor Moon met the same fate. There is ghosting, but 95% of it isn't noticeable unless you pause the Blu-Ray, so it isn't very distracting. The frequenty blurry image is more of a problem.

The Good: Mirakuru Romansu

The packaging is GORGEOUS! A pink shimmery (very sturdy!) box big enough to hold the first two volumes with an 88 page full color booklet with a complete 46 episode season one guide, and some beautiful promo photos and charcter profiles in the back.

The Blu-ray menu is beautifully animated and laid out, but it's still practical and simple to navigate without unnecessary transitions and animation between menus.

The new dub is totally awesome. I know there are a million people who disagree - but I've been a fan since the beginning and watched the DiC dub and the Cloverway dub, but after coming to realize how bad they were, I switched to Japanese-only, as the original English versions became unwatchable to me. I longed for a new dub, and Viz has answered my prayers, and I fully support it. It's not perfect, but it's as close as we'll ever get. And purists may cringe to hear that they have thrown in many one-liners not present in the Japanese version, but they're hilarious! Umino is actually funny in this new dub as opposed to being strictly obnoxious, as in other versions. So even though the video quality leaves me wishing I held on to my old DVD's, the new dub is entertaining enough that I'm learning to get over it.

I heard a rumor that the DVDs in the set were originally going to be unmastered for purists, but that idea was scrapped. The DVDs are pointless and add nothing to the set but the size of the box. It would be nice if they decide to leave the DVD footage untouched, because then I would actually use them.

If you are considering getting this set, here is my advice:

Buy: If you welcome a new dub, aren't a crazed videophile, want to support Viz and hope future sets are handled with a little more finesse.

Don't Buy: If you watch the show in Japanese only or are a proclaimed videophile. You may prefer the original ADV season one set for about the same price as the first two Viz volumes (that make up season one). But know that ADVs release has the worst Japanese audio presentation the show has seen outside of bootleg VHS tapes from the 90s.

So as of now there is no ""Dragon Box"" equivelent of Sailor Moon on home video, just scattered releases and alternate versions that each have their pros and cons. It's up to you to decide which aspects of the presentation are most important. For me, it was the new English dub, so this set works for me. Just less DNR on the next one, Viz! And tone those colors down a bit while you're at it.",1415664000,5,3281,4.4790619765494135
6517457,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I pre-ordered this on rightstuff.com.

I think, despite the issues, Viz has done as much as they could with the source they were given from TOEI.

And I think you should still buy it, if only for the blu-ray and not for the DVDs (Due to the Anamorphic issues causing it to be displayed as 4:3 within a letterboxed 16:9. An issue that will apparently be fixed in future sets. But REALLY irritating that they aren't offering to fix it HERE.).

And to support Viz and hopefully for the future of the remaining episodes.

It's not as good as the R2 DVDs, but it's better than the original R1 DVDs that we got.

It's the best I can offer, despite the cynic in me knowing that some point TOEI will probably come along and release an absurdly JPN only blu-ray set with the original film that they just happened to magically ""Find""",1415664000,4,823,4.3881578947368425
6517458,1,B00M0DTYUW,"I wanted to like this, I really did.  Above all things, I am glad there's finally a legal way to buy Sailor Moon in North America, so I thank Viz for that.  They unfortunately, however, built up hype for this much beloved, anticipated series, and were not able to deliver.

Here's how I came down to one star:

1.)  The quality issues.  Other posters have more thoroughly covered them.  It doesn't look so bad when I'm sitting a great distance away from the screen, but any closer and it just looks horrendous.  The ghosting and blurriness are hard to look past, and I'm not usually very critical.

2.)  The mistake with the DVDs is definitely a problem (again, other reviews cover this in more thorough detail) and is unacceptable no matter what way you look at it- Viz has said they will correct this with future releases, but in the meantime we're stuck with a defective product.

3.)  There is no way to turn off the subtitles when you are watching it in Japanese.  This is a HUGE annoyance, and I don't understand how it's acceptable to not allow subtitles to be turned off unless you are watching it in English.  As someone who speaks fluent Japanese and still wanted to support a stateside release, it's kind of a drag.  It's standard to be able to change language and turn on/off subtitles for just about everything.  You have to bring up the menu in order to change your preference, and your options are:  English, English w/ subtitles, English w/ subtitles including song lyrics and sign translations, and Japanese w/ subtitles.  You CANNOT change these options with your remote control, like normal Blu-rays/DVDs.

4.)  The voices aren't absolutely terrible from what I've watched so far, but they're not great.  Of course, nothing will hold a candle to the original voices.  It will be nice to finally have consistency throughout a series, though, and I'm sure there will be at least some improvement as the voice actors get comfortable in their roles.

It would have been great to have the opening and ending songs actually recorded in English- I know at least a few of the voice actors sing really well, but I am okay with it as is.

The chipboard box is pretty, the packaging is pretty, and the main menu is GREAT!
The little booklet it comes with doesn't really add any value to the set.  There's nothing in it of real interest, except maybe the last few pages of pretty artwork by Italian artist Marco Albiero.

I just can't bring myself to even give it two stars.  I was looking forward to this set and was so sorely disappointed, and I don't typically have very high standards, because I understand there are always limitations.  The inability to turn off subtitles when watching in Japanese, poor quality control, the DVD error and Viz's reluctance to admit mistakes are my biggest problems with it, and unfortunately they much outweigh the sparkly, pretty packaging and beautiful menus.

I'm hoping the future releases will improve.

**Update:  I originally decided to raise the review up to 2 stars. It was pointed out to me that the lack of ability to turn off subtitles may be attributed to licensing (I am unsure if this is actually the case or not, but it would make sense if it was.) After an abysmal interview with Viz, however, and the obvious lying and disregard for their customers, I had to drop it back down to 1 star.  This blog post: http://www.kentaiblog.com/2014/11/lying-evily-by-moonlight-viz-defends.html explains why they have been flat-out lying.  They even went so far as to say, when asked if the mistake with the DVDs would be fixed for this release (they already said it would be for *future* releases), they said ""No.  Consider it a collector's edition.  Hahahahaha"".  If that isn't a giant middle finger to devoted fans who've been waiting a long time for this release, I don't know what is.",1415664000,14,3839,4.728915662650603
6517459,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I love this show. In fact, it is probably one of my top five animes of all time. Probably much closer to being first place on the list than any other anime show. Without a doubt, it is a 5 star show all the way and a 5 star release all the way (even though i wish it was all of season one instead of only 23 episodes), but the 1 star comes to the new English voice cast.

I understand the original DIC dubb in the 90's was heavily edited, and some fans viled that release, but i personally loved it. It introduced me to anime when anime wasn't easily accessible in America during that time. Whereas now, anime is widely available in all forums such as blu-ray, Netflix and even Amazon as part of their streaming collection.

This show originally aired at 630am in the morning, but i still forced myself to wake up anyways and not miss any episodes. I even recorded every episode i could on my VHS tapes. The show had heart, laughter, and the English voice cast was just spot on. The biggest problem with this set is the new voice actors really lack ""personality"". The original DIC dubb had no trouble in that department. I understand staying true to the source, and not deviating, but i think it is great that DIC americanized it for the US audiences and made pop culture references that were relatable. For instance when Serena/Sailor Moon says 'Joey Lawrence' when Molly confides she has a secret crush on an older man. I miss Terri Hawkes voice sooooo much. She was a great Sailor Moon and probably the only one that could voice her besides Tracey Moore who dubbed about 13 episodes in season one. They both balanced comedy and emotion perfectly.

Anyways, that is my rant. I love the release, brought it, but find the voice actors to be bland and boring and they are literally reading the Japanese subtitles word for word, but with their English voices.

Update:
So i got my set today in the mail and i have been watching the episodes for a few hours straight and i get tempted to pop in my old DVDs and watch the original voice cast. As mentioned, a lot of the actors almost sound the same and there is no variety whatsoever. Luna sounds like a kid, Molly sounds like Luna, Melvin doesn't sound like a geek. Serena's mother sounds like a teenager and her younger brother Sammy sounds like he is 30. Yes, i said it using their American names. The 1080P HD isn't even that noticeable after the first episode. Here are something others that bug me.

Amy is pronounced OM-ME. AMY is just AMY or AMI. Not OMMMMM-MEEEEEE
Jedite is just JED-DITE and not JADE-DITE. He is not some chinese jewel.
Stephanie is not horrible as Sailor Moon, but she can come off a bit annoying at times. None of the voice actors have any comedic timing in their voice.
English subtitles are simple structured sentences that anyone can write and it comes off so bland when the voice actors read it word for word without any ablibs.
Here are some dumb lines: So you are part of the bad guys team.  REALLY???
Luna now says: WHAT? Instead of: WHHHHAAAATTTTTT!!!!!! No personality whatsoever. Just LIFELESS.
Jokes are lost in translation and do not come off funny.
The boring Japanese music surely doesn't hold up 20 plus years later.
The original English music was great and full of energy. They fit each scene perfectly.
I miss the original voice cast sooooo much.
Saying Moon Prism Power Make Up is sooooo CORNY. Remove the make up.
Terri Hawkes laughter was infectious and endearing. Stephanie Sheh just comes off fake when she laughs.
Now it is BUN HEAD instead of Meatball head. Americans never use the word BUN and even when they go to Starbucks to get a pastry, they never say: Let me get some buns. Meatball head is just funnier and more relatable. I can go on and on, but let me stop now.
I added pictures of the box set and hope you enjoy them.",1415577600,4,3827,4.452211126961483

It makes no sense. You all should be thankful that Viz Media did a new English dub and this time, it's the entire series without skipping any episodes. I know I am.

P.S. I should probably be rating it five stars, but I haven't seen it yet, so that's why I only put four stars on here.",1415577600,,458,4.088888888888889
6517461,1,B00M0DTYUW,"This review will only address video quality issues on the new Blu-ray and DVD releases. There has been a lot said here and on various forums about the issues with these discs, and this review will address and explain concisely exactly what the problems are and why not only is this set a complete and utter disaster, but that there are very good grounds for a recall and replacement program. In other words, not only are there serious image quality problems, there are also image quality mistakes that should never have gotten past the QC stage and need rectifying.

When Viz announced they were releasing Sailor Moon this year, they took part in an interview with ANN and it was made clear that they would be using Toei's old standard definition masters for the basis of their release. This was disappointing considering they had announced Blu-rays, but let me be clear that none of the issues with these sets have anything to do with them being in standard definition. We knew that going in and were prepared for it. You can read the full interview here:

http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-05-16/exclusive/viz-media-charlene-ingram-and-josh-lopez-on-sailor-moon

The real problem lies in Viz's announcement that they were going to ""remaster"" these SD files to make them look HD. Alarm bells went off in every videophiles head when reading this, as what Viz was describing was simply not possible. Remastering in this sense means to post process to try and remove the inadequacies of the SD source, and to then smooth everything over to make it ""look HD"". On top of this, the comparison picture Viz used in the interview to show how their release was going to be so much better than the most recent Japanese version turned out to be doctored:

How Viz said the Japanese DVDs looked: http://i.imgur.com/7n6t4KF.jpg
How the Japanese DVDs actually look: http://i.imgur.com/jFoolUH.jpg

Videophiles were rightly very worried, but they had to wait to see the discs themselves and now that they have, they are in uproar, and rightly so. So, onto the image problems:

1) The little detail that was in the SD source has been wiped away by aggressive filtering techniques, in an attempt to make everything look bright, clean and glossy. Below is a comparison with the Japanese SD master (used on the Japanese DVDs, and recent Italian and German DVDs):

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=98804

The DVD is first, and when you mouse over the Viz Blu-ray is revealed. At first it may seem like the the Viz image is better and more ""HD like"" but this is exactly what Viz are going for. If you look closer you'll see that there is no longer any fine detail in the image. The lines on the garden wall and road are gone, the tiles on the roof are gone, the markings on the car tyres are gone, the trees and their leaves are heavily blurred, along with everything else.

2) There is severe split second ghosting noticeable whenever there is fast movement within the frame, likely due to poor inverse telecine (the one worthwhile thing Viz attempted for their remaster; sadly, they totally botched it).

Basically, whenever something moves fast it leaves behind a ""ghost"" image of itself in the next frame. This will be more noticeable to some, but crucially it was not something present on the Japanese or Italian DVDs. There are many comparisons and examples available:

http://i.imgur.com/k6JlWR5.png
http://i.imgur.com/je4X4f0.png
http://i.imgur.com/ZC4oqek.png

Combine these two issues together and you have a very poor looking release indeed, one that falls far short of what was released in Japan and Italy and Germany, despite Viz saying in the aforementioned interview that ""It looks significantly better than any other DVD that's come out, lots of care was put into it"".

I don't doubt Viz's sincerity. They may believe, like many people who have bought this set, that it looks great and better than anything that has come before. No videophile would ever agree with that since it is simply a fact that there are filtering and ghosting problems with the release, but Viz and others are welcome to feel that they genuinely improve on the image. Which release is best is down to personal opinion.

What is not a matter of opinion is the very unfortunate encoding mistake that Viz have made with this set. It is a mistake that only affects the DVDs, but one should keep in mind that most people are still not Blu-ray compatible, that many people will be buying the DVDs alone because of this, and that they deserve a high quality release as well. Even people who can play Blu-rays may be opting for the much cheaper DVD only release because as the below image shows, there is very little difference between the Blu-rays and the DVDs in these sets. Keep in mind that the source for all of these discs was standard definition, so this shouldn't be a surprise:

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=98937

As you can see, there is no more detail or sharpness on the Blu-rays compared to the DVDs, though the Blu-rays are a little brighter.

The DVDs that Viz have released have been encoded in anamorphic 16x9 widescreen, despite Sailor Moon being a 4x3 show. When Viz received the 4x3 masters from Toei, they had to add large black pillar bars to the side of the image so that it conformed to the 16x9 HD standard. This was absolutely fine and is necessary with all 4x3 titles that receive a Blu-ray release.

But because DVD is a 4x3 format, one must remember to remove these pillar bars before authoring the DVDs. In its ""HD"" form, Sailor Moon is 16x9, and because Viz have kept this form for the DVD, the DVDs interpret the files to be in widescreen. What this means is that the large black pillar bars remain on the DVDs, burnt into the image, and an anamorphic flag is present to stretch the image to its proper proportions on playback.

This affects the image in two ways. First, instead of using the entire 720x480 resolution that the Japanese and Italian DVDs did, the Viz DVDs instead only use 540x480. They are thus of lower resolution, and lose sharpness and detail on top of all the detail already removed by the filtering.

Second, anyone who is watching the DVDs on a 4x3 shaped screen (a CRT for example) is going to be forced to see these black bars, even though they shouldn't have to. If they were watching the Japanese or Italian DVDs, the image would appear like this on their 4x3 TV:

http://i.imgur.com/xiD0s3J.png

But when they watch the Viz DVDs, they'll see the black bars:

http://i.imgur.com/H99p9Ys.png (incidentally, one can see more ghosting here!)

But it gets worse, as they won't just see those black bars. The anamorphic flag will first stretch the image to 16x9, and more black bars will appear on the top and bottom of the screen to maintain the proper image dimensions. What viewers will actually see is this:

http://i.imgur.com/QZKyeTr.png

A small image surrounded by thick black bars on all 4 sides.

As I've said before, unlike the filtering and ghosting of these releases, this encoding issue is not a by-product of Viz's ""remaster"". It is completely unintentional and somehow Viz have let it slip through QC. It is a simple, standard practice to remove black bars from 4x3 HD masters when authoring DVDs.

On this issue at least, Viz owe their customers a recall and replacement program. So far they have been completely silent on the issue and as far as we know have no intention of doing anything. Regarding the remastering issues this is to be expected (all this ""work"" didn't come cheap after all!), but it would be unprofessional in the extreme to not do anything about the DVDs.

What I would like to see is instead of Viz going back and manually removing the black bars from their new remaster, they would be better off taking the original Japanese master that they had before they tinkered with it, and put that on the DVDs instead. This would fix the black bar problem as there are no black bars on the Japanese master, and on top of that there would be a general improvement in the image. There would be no more ghosting, and all the detail would come back. This way consumers would get a choice: if they want to watch the smooth, ghosty HD versions they can do so by watching the Blu-rays (and Viz will not feel the whole thing was a waste of time and money), or they can watch the DVDs and have something on par with the Japanese and Italian discs. Viz would then just need to follow this style of releasing for their future sets (and to keep a sharper eye on QC!)

Doing this would solve every single problem I've mentioned in this review, and everyone could be happy. I hope Viz will give it serious consideration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/12/14 - UPDATE 1:

So after enough badgering on Facebook Viz offered the following blog post as an explanation for this whole mess:

http://blog.neonalley.com/an-inside-look-at-the-new-sailor-moon-blu-ray-releases/

It shouldn't surprise anyone that the information there explains nothing, and instead has only led to more questions. In the blog post, Viz claim to be using as a source the same master that fueled the Japanese DVD releases from 2009 (and consequently, 2002, since they're the same). They present comparison images showing first what looks like an absolutely disastrous looking source master, riddled with visible interlacing, and then their Blu-ray images showing how they've done their best to improve on that master.

There is no doubt that Viz's Blu-ray is an improvement on the master they put it alongside. The sticking point is that this supposed master they had to work from is NOT what fueled the Japanese DVD releases like they claim. Below is a set of comparisons of the master Viz say they had to work from, and what is actually on the Japanese DVDs:

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/99638/picture:0

To demonstrate that the Japanese DVDs are still much better than Viz's Blu-ray, even after Viz's post work, the below set of comparisons compare the two:

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/99639/picture:0

There are also a few more general comparisons here for anyone interested: http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=99793 - http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=99622

When faced with this information, Viz claim that it is possible that the master that fueled the Japanese DVDs has since ""degraded"", as Toei are assuring them there is only a single master in existence.

But there is another sticking point. Viz do not seem to be aware that the very healthy looking master that was used for the Japanese DVDs was used as recently as 2011 in Italy, and as recently as November 2013 in Germany and France. In fact, Germany and France are still currently producing their sets, with Sailor Moon S being released just this month. Bizarrely it is Kaze, a subsidiary of Viz's sister company Viz Europe, who are the ones who are releasing these sets. So Viz and Toei are asking us to believe that at the same time that Kaze and Viz Europe are producing their own Sailor Moon releases, Viz America are getting stuck with a completely different, utterly inferior master. That simply does not wash. When this was put to Viz, they could not explain and advised people to enquire with Toei.

Even more bizarrely, it has since been discovered that the clean opening and closing videos featured in the extras on the Viz sets are free of any remastering (thus there is no ghosting or filtering), but more importantly, they're also free of any of the problems that Viz claim were blighting the master they received before they ""remastered"" it. You can read more about this discrepancy in the ANN review:

http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/shelf-life/2014-11-10/.80890

There is also a video comparison here, showing the lack of ghosting on the clean opening:

https://vine.co/v/OiJE1BaFHWj

So, I think one of three things are happening here.

1) Toei have unintentionally altered the master they gave to Kaze when they gave a copy of it to Viz around the same time. Viz were too blind to notice there was something wrong with the master they received, and something completely different about it compared to what their own sister company had received. Now that the money has been spent trying to fix this accidentally botched master, neither Viz nor Toei want to own up that they made a mistake and are forcing American fans to swallow a flawed release whilst at the same time European countries receive superior releases.

2) Toei have intentionally altered the master in some warped attempt to prevent reverse importation of Viz's new Blu-ray. They wouldn't have to worry about this happening with the European sets because they are DVD only, and Japan already has their own native DVD release. But Japan does not have a Blu-ray version, even a fake upscaled one, and Toei don't want another market to get something that will be as good as their own future upscale release. This of course leaves Viz in an impossible situation.

3) Viz received the same thing as Kaze, they did a poor ""remaster"" which was well received on Hulu, and now there at a loss as to what to do when many fans are saying it is not acceptable for home video. They've provided images of the ""source"" they had to work with, which in reality is just the good master somewhere along the ""remaster"" chain. This would of course mean Viz are lying through their teeth.

Tellingly they've stated they did not produce the images on the blog, but that they were provided by a third party that they can't reveal. I imagine this means either Toei or Subatomic Digital (the post house that did the ""remaster""). One of those parties may be misleading Viz about the nature of these images (which wouldn't be hard since Viz doesn't seem to know when something looks good and when something looks bad), making them the liars rather than Viz.

All told I think (and hope) that number 1 is most likely. If it is it may even be possible that Viz received non-flawed masters for Sailor Moon R and onwards, and can give us something on par with their European counterparts. They'd have a real time explaining why everything suddenly looks better though!

So, what is a video conscious Sailor Moon fan to do? Even with the flaws these sets are still the best English friendly releases in the world, and actually have the best audio over any other. But for me the video issues are too much. If Viz are not going to do anything about this (and it seems now to be certain that they won't), and if Kaze/Manga Entertainment don't release a localised version of their recent box sets in the U.K., then I will buy the Italian DVD sets alongside the Viz DVD only sets.

Anyone with a semi-decent workstation and a bit of know how can take the video files from the Italian DVDs (which are actually the best looking versions in the world, even slightly better than the Japanese DVDs), which are uncut just like Viz's version (and progressive rather than interlaced), and slow the video down from its current 25fps back to its native 24fps, using Final Cut Pro or Sony Vegas, or similar programs. Then it's just a case of taking the superior audio from the Viz DVDs (English or Japanese depending on your preference, along with the subtitles if it's the latter), and muxing them back together. They should generally match up, but some post synch work will be needed.

The entirety of Sailor Moon was released across 11 sets in Italy, and each are available for $34 from Amazon.it at checkout (delivery to the US brings them to $49). The Viz DVDs can be had for around $25, although this will certainly fall over time. Worst case scenario the whole endeavor would cost $789. To buy all of the planned Viz Blu-ray sets will probably set you back around $550. For some, including myself, the extra $250 will be worth paying. Of course, there will be other ways to acquire the Viz audio and subtitles, but I don't advocate that. If you're the type who feels pretty collectors packaging is essential, then the Italian sets are even bigger and prettier than the Viz ones:

http://i.imgur.com/JatzCj4.jpg

P.S.

Some clever person has done their own amateur upscale of the Japanese/European DVDs, and compared it to the Viz Blu-ray here:

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=99859

It has its own share of problems (demonstrating that no upscale is really worth it), but it is leaps and bounds ahead of what Viz have been able to achieve. Just look at cap number 7 and keep in mind someone made that by themselves in their bedroom, and Viz made their version using professional post houses and important things like money and such.

P.P.S. During all this Viz did admit that the authoring flaw on the DVDs (the pillarbars) was a mistake and they will make sure it is not repeated on future sets. They insist though that they will not go back and fix this first set, or provide replacements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/16/14 - UPDATE 2:

Since the last update Viz took part in a podcast with ANN. You can listen to it here:

http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2014-11-13/.81009

Not surprisingly they didn't really clear anything up and we now only have more questions. They were very clear though that no replacement programme will be forthcoming, and they will not be changing how they address the video on future sets in any significant way. Rather than go through the podcast and detail it here, I'll instead provide a link to Kentai's film blog, where he has written his own response to the podcast:

http://www.kentaiblog.com/2014_11_01_archive.html

It is excellent reading and better than I could do myself, primarily because Mr. Kentai actually knows what he is talking about, being a professional disc producer/video expert who has worked on many anime DVDs.

He makes a very good case for theory number 3 (listed above), that this is all Viz's doing and they are actively trying to deceive people in their responses to Facebook questions, on their blog, and on the podcast.",1415318400,445,18493,5.0648452929558925
6517462,4,B00M0DTYUW,"Viz Media has presented a wonderful release for the first half of the first season of Sailor Moon. The Limited Edition version comes in a sturdy box that has room for set 2 and features an 88 page book with an episode guide, character bios and artwork (the book is for the entire first season, not just part 1). The 6-disc Blu-Ray case houses 3 BD and 3 DVD discs. It's a very nice package that will make this set collectible once part 2 is released.

The first 23 episodes are presented uncropped and uncut. The original Japanese audio is here with subtitle options, as well as the brand new dub which is more faithful to the original series than the previous dub by DiC. Viz has also included some bonus features from anime conventions hyping the release, behind the scenes with the new voice actors, and art galleries.

Why didn't i give this release 5 stars? Well the reason seems to be a little bit out of Viz's control, but the video quality isn't as nice as it could have been. It's MUCH better than the previous US DVD release, but the source material Toei Animation gave them was a color adjusted DVD master from 2009. Viz has adjusted the colors to be more faithful to the original version, but in their efforts to upscale the video to HD, some DNR (digital noise reduction) was applied resulting in a loss of detail in some scenes. But the bottom line is that this is the best release the US has ever seen of this series.",1415059200,4,1432,4.4
6517463,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I couldn't put into words how ecstatic I was when they announced Sailor Moon was getting re-released on Blu-ray with an all new unedited English dub.  I'd been praying for that to happen for the past five years.

I purchased the limited edition version from Rightstuf and was pleasantly surprised to see that it arrived today, November 3rd, when it's supposed to be released the 11th!  The price here on Amazon is kind of high, but don't let that scare you away.  Trust me, it's worth it.

Honestly, I can't say anything bad about this first release.  The quality is superb.  I've been a big fan of the DIC dub since I was seven years old, back when Sailor Moon aired on Cartoon Network.  And I've gotta say, this new dub is amazing!  Usagi sounds like Usagi this time around, and Ami's voice is the cutest thing ever!  (As a big fan of Barbie movies, I was so happy Katie Higgins got her role!).  I love all of the new voice actors and I think they're doing an amazing job.  I can't wait for the second half of the season, and I'm really looking forward to the others, especially Stars.

I'd always watched the original Japanese version, but it's such a relief to be able to enjoy the show in my native language without all the censorship and name changes.  My younger siblings are happy too, as they're big SM fans and dislike subtitles.

Overall, I recommend this to any Sailor Moon fan, and even to those who haven't seen the show, but have always been curious about it.  Sailor Moon is a classic anime, and if you've known it all your life like I have, you'll love it even more.",1414972800,16,1583,4.3883161512027495
6517464,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I had the original ADV uncut and subtitled version Sailor Moon Season 1 and 2. It was a VHS-to-DVD copy with mono audio. While it was great to see the series in it's unedited glory, the experience was hampered by the poor quality of the video.

This release does it right! It's a *true remastered version* of the series. The picture is crisp and clear; probably better looking than when it first aired. The audio is in stereo and sounds great! Not only do you get this remastered edition in bluray, you get it in DVD too! The box is beautiful to look at and comes with an art book. (I ordered this somewhere else and got a collectable coin as well!)

The dub is actually very well done! While I do have a strong attachment to the original English dub and music, I feel that this version is just as good. This dub tries to be more true to it's Japanese counter part and the characters themselves. The script-writing is, in my opinion, excellent. It strikes a nice balance between localization and keeping true to the original dialogue. (Part of what makes a bad dub isn't just the voice actors, but the script as well. I think VIZ did a excellent job in both departments.)

My only regret is that there isn't any Behind the Scenes type stuff for Part 1. Or even a History Of... for the series. Perhaps we'll get something like that with Season 1 Part 2?

As to people complaining about the price... well... it's a Limited Collector's Edition Box set. They aren't ever cheap! I pre-ordered mine on a different site, so I got a good deal. I imagine VIZ will release Season 1 as a non-collector's edition at some point and that will be significantly cheaper. But first they're releasing their Collectable stuff and that's more expensive. If you don't want to pay, don't. You can watch it for free on Hulu (sans the dub).

For myself, getting such a beautiful boxset and magnificent remastered edition of a series I loved was well worth the money I paid for it. I've already pre-ordered Part 2 and plan on doing so for every Limited Edition box set that comes out! I've waited years and years to get a decent release of this series, and I don't plan on letting it pass me by now! :D",1414886400,4,2177,4.418952618453865
6517465,1,B00M0DTYUW,"I never understood the point of defending a company's wrongdoings just because you're a fan of the show. This set of episodes is overpriced, plain and simple. Dragonball Z came to the US around the same time as Sailor Moon, has also been redubbed since the original broadcast, and is on the same level of popularity (If not higher), yet the blu ray releases aren't half as expensive. This set only has 23 episodes and it's $72, while the first new Dragonball Z set has 39 episodes and it's $25! Viz is obviously doing this to take advantage of people who have been thirsting for a proper release for years.

They're selling this on rightstuf.com for $60 bucks (Was $57 when preorders were first made available), but this price is still unacceptable for only 23 episodes and a lame booklet. These companies only do this to us because they know complacent fangirls and boys will accept anything just because they like a show. This price is absolutely ridiculous, and a huge slap in the face to all of us. Speaking out about this doesn't make us ""fake fans"", we just know when we're being screwed.

****UPDATE**** The price has since been lowered, thanks to me and others like me who were not afraid to speak out about it. It's still too high for what we're getting, but it's a much better deal. You're welcome.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****UPDATE 2**** I have received a physical copy of this set so I thought I would do a part 2 and share some things I've learned.

[The picture quality isn't what I thought it would be]
It seems very grainy and dull colored. I'm not sure if the footage was actually remastered or what, but the picture definitely isn't on the same level as other late 80's/early 90's sets like the Dragonbox (Which is on DVD) I have seen internet videos that have better picture quality than what's on these discs. The footage also appears to shake at certain points for some reason.

[The new dub is pretty solid]
I loved the original DiC dub, and I think these voices are just as good. None of them really stray that far from the originals besides Luna and other characters who used to have accents. I'm not a big fan of the Japanese background music for this show but the show is still watchable with it for those who grew up with the original dub.

[There are virtually no differences between the DVD's and the Blu Ray disc's in video quality]
The English annotations of Japanese words found in the anime are slightly blurrier on the DVD version and the Blu Ray's and DVD's have different menus, but those are the only differences between Blu Ray and DVD I can see.

[What you get isn't a lot]
The box that it comes with has a cool holographic design, with a Blu Ray summary sloppily glued onto the back. There's also a little art booklet, an empty box that fills the slot where 'Season 1 Part 2' is supposed to go, and DVD versions of the Blu Ray's.

Overall, I'm not too impressed with this Blu Ray set. You're not really getting a whole lot of content or quality to justify paying 50-70 bucks for it. If you're a hardcore Sailor Moon fan, I guess you could buy it for the booklet and shiny box, but for everyone else, avoid this and stick to the cheaper DVD only version. I'm going to give this Sailor Moon Season 1 Part 1 Blu Ray/DVD set a 2.5....out of 10.",1414800000,23,3395,4.648333333333333

The new voices are all very suited to the characters and the plot stays true to the original while still making it accessible to English speakers. Other than light remastering of the animation, there's been no real editing. That said, $40 is a LOT for half a season, even with how long the seasons are.

Took a bit to get used to hearing it in English (I'm a big fan of the original Japanese cast), but it was so great!  I think the cast did a great job, and the acting improved from episode to episode.  Also, since I didn't have to stare at the bottom of the screen for subtitles the whole time, I caught details I hadn't noticed before.  I really felt the care they put into this show, and I am so happy to finally, finally, be able to own a quality version of Sailormoon.",1409875200,13,579,4.133928571428571

6517473,2,B00M0DTYUW,"I don't see why everyone is so excited about this. This is NOT the original North American english dub we got in the mid 90s. That dub was excellent, despite a few small censors here and there, and several episodes that were missing from the original Japanese version. Instead, they are redubbing the entire series in english, once again. What's the point? Most of the episodes were already dubbed once before (except for the final season) and were great. Why not dub the MISSING episodes (those that were never dubbed during the original english broadcast in North America), and keep an option to watch the uncensored Japanese episodes for the episodes that were dubbed and censored.

If you only want the Japanese version, that set's been out for a very long time. So what you are getting here is the Japanese dub and an entirely newly recorded english dub, which means it has no nostalgic value to anyone who grew up watching this on YTV or Cartoon Network. In other words, if you want this for nostalgic reasons, you would do better to pass on this. However if you don't care about that and want to see every episode uncensored and dubbed in english with a new cast, this set is for you.",1409702400,13,1191,4.591549295774648

6517478,5,B00M0DTYUW,"I see everyone complaining about the price of this product but what people are failing to realize that back in February of 2001 when Sailor Moon S Heart collection 1 came out it went for $30. Every bilingual release with the exception of SuperS's Pegasus collection 7 went for the same price. Even the movies which were 60 minutes a piece went for $30. The original ADV sets for Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R went for $150 and season 1 had horrible audio and Season 2 was missing episode 67 plus those only had the Japanese track.  This is a very reasonable price for a COMBO PACK seriously. People expect so much without having to pay for it. My original Sailor Moon collection of DVDs cost me nearly $2000. I would gladly pay another $700-$800 for a non butchered one.

8669318,4,B00M0DTYUW,"The Season 1 Part One DVD is as simple as can be. I'd like to know if it was supposed to come with a cardboard slipcover like Part 2, because while the artwork is obviously matching, a possible slipcover on the first set was missing at arrival. I'm not picky, but there will be some inconsistency with my collection, if all the following dvd cases have slip covers. I've only watched the first episode so far from this set. I have actually seen the entire series before, and just wanted to see the quality before I really sit down to binge. There is no booklet or even flier inside, it's really just the show for the show's sake, but considering I'm collecting on a budget and I already have all of the Sailor Moon Manga and a lot of other memorabilia I'm okay with it, I rather prefer that the massive 200 episode collection (plus movies) will be a little more streamlined with the absence of such things.
The video quality is fine, especially considering how poor the quality was when it aired on tv in the 90s and how it looked on 90s computers when we managed to watch original episodes online somehow in terrible resolution. The subtitles are a little pixelated on my laptop, but I think from across the room when it's on my tv I probably won't notice.
 Bottom line, I'll finally have a licensed version of the original Sailor Moon show to watch on my tv and I'm quite happy about it! :) I'd like that slipcover but... eh, I'd rather just watch the show more.",1528502400,,1464,4.402214022140221

8669321,5,B00M0DTYUW,"Ok, I'm really excited about this set, and haven't watched the discs themselves yet, but I've been watching the series on Hulu in DVD quality. I don't know why so many people complain about the quality, Viz did a GREAT job restoring 1992 animation! Not only is it more sharp and crisp, it is also brighter, and there is more of the image that fits on the screen. This release is also apparently the first English Uncut release for the series, so you get episodes that were never released before, and new lines and scenes.

The box for this set is wonderful, and the artwork on it is perfect. The included booklet has a handy episode and character guide, as well as art of the tv series. The box has small holographic details on the corners, and Usagi's transformation broach on the back. It has a light shimmer, and is perfect for showcasing the series.

People need to stop being so picky, they should actually be grateful to Viz for this release. The voice acting fits everyone perfectly for their personality, and many of the voices are a definite upgrade to the originals. This is the perfect release that the series deserved from the start.

This series is a great price for the Collector's set, and how many great episodes you get for both Part 1 and 2. This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and now that I've started rewatching it, I'm a total Moonie!",1526688000,,1366,4.477911646586345

8669323,3,B00M0DTYUW,"I bought the whole first season (this set and the next) directly from a store but wanted to review here to share some thoughts and help let people know what they're in for.

The video quality IS a little off, mostly in this first half of the first season. I noticed the ghosting effect described in other reviews mainly in the opening. It really got bad in the last third of the radio show episode, which was where I was most disappointed. It does get better in the next DVD set, though, and overall I didn't notice too much.

The packaging is also flimsy. The hinge holding the discs in the box came broken on the second set, and the disc holder rattles around in the box. The hinge was just a thin piece of plastic, not sturdy for long term use.

The biggest problem I have, though, is with the new dub. I loved the original dub of this show, but was willing to give this a shot. Unfortunately, these voice actors do not hold up. As campy as the original voices were, at least they had lots of energy and didn't hold back. With these new actors, I can almost picture the person sitting in a studio, reading their lines into a microphone. The awareness that they're just dubbing lines for a cartoon is nearly audible, like it would be beneath them to get fully invested. Theres no chance to really get absorbed into whats happening in the show because the actors aren't absorbed, themselves. Its a problem I have with a lot of modern dubs.

This lack of enthusiasm does improve a bit toward the later parts of season one, but the problem that gnaws at me the whole way is how much all the characters sound the same. In the original dub, at least the characters each had distinct voices, even if they were over the top. In this dub, if I close my eyes I cannot tell who is talking. The only one with a distinguishable voice is Sailor Jupiter. Everyone else is just doing a generic girl voice - even for Luna. Sailor Mars has a slight edge to her voice, but thats the most you get. Compare this to the dub of Lucky Star (which Sailor Moons new voice actor is ironically in). That show also has a large cast of female characters, but I can easily recall each characters unique voice from memory. Why couldn't they do that for this dub? Sailor Moon is one of the most treasured anime of all time; I expected MUCH better.

One thing I will give the new dub credit for is the voices of the villains. These are a breath of fresh air and not nearly as bland as the heroes. The bad guys are much more menacing when they're not overacting, and the voices are all distinct to their characters. If the entire cast had been like this, I would enjoy the new dub.

These discs do include the original Japanese audio, as well, but I find Usagis Japanese voice far too grating to bear. The music in both versions here is also poor compared to the original English dub. Almost all of the music is jazzy, even during action scenes. Its unfitting and unpleasant to listen to. Most of the time nowadays, I do prefer watching the Japanese subs of anime, but this one just won't grow on me. I acknowledge the original dub can be cringey and poorly written, but it still has an energy and charm that stands over this new sophisticated dub.

Despite all this...it is still nice to have Sailor Moon on DVD, and this is the option were given. At least we get to see all the moments or even episodes that were cut in the original English release. If nothing else, you finally get the full, true version of the story that was intended. I would still recommend if you're a Sailor Moon fan who is open minded or accustomed to a version of anime that is more faithful to the original Japanese. If you have your heart set on that original English dub you grew up with, though, this is not where to find it.",1525564800,,3774,4.314527503526093
