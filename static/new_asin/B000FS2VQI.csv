2583608,5,B000FS2VQI,My son loves Charlie and Lola.  We have been looking forward to it coming out on video in the US for quite some time.  He is two and asks to watch Lola everynight before bed.,1163030400,2,174,3.942857142857143

2583610,5,B000FS2VQI,"""Charlie and Lola"" is a delightful series based on books by Lauren Child. It is seen on Playhouse Disney in the United States and on CBeebies in Great Britain.

In this series, Charlie has a little sister named Lola who is small and very funny. Charlie often helps Lola with her problems and though they have some sibling rivalry at times, they are usually pretty nice with each other. Lola often has an unusual way of seeing things, or can be a bit stubborn, but Charlie helps her to look at things in a new way or to try new things.

This DVD features seven stories from the first season of the show --- ""I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato"" (based on the first C+L book), ""We Do Promise Honestly We Can Look After Your Dog,"" ""I Love Going to Granny and Grandpa's, It's Just That...,"" ""I'm Far Too Extremely Busy, ""It's a Secret,"" ""I'm Just Not Keen on Spiders"" and ""I'm Not Feeling Well.""

The animation is unique and fun to look at. The main theme and background music are all very catchy. The British-accented dialogue and phrases also add a lot to the series.

""Charlie and Lola"" airs full-screen on Playhouse Disney, but it is presented in widescreen on the DVD. Close-captioning is not offered --- there are subtitles instead. The DVD also includes a few bonuses / surprises --- watch for them to pop up while both on the main and episode-selection menus.",1160438400,23,1362,4.479838709677419
2583611,5,B000FS2VQI,"My 2 year old loves Charlie and Lola, and so do my husband and I. It's one of the few DVD's the whole family wants to watch over and over. After seeing ""I will never ever eat a tomato"" my daughter has renamed all the food she previously wouldn't eat, and is happy to eat 'green drops' 'moon squirters' and she actually demanded fish fingers which she had never seen or heard of before and ate them all up (we sneaked her some non-fried fish and told her they were f.fingres, she was none the wiser.)  Unlike many kid's shows, the characters speak in convincing voices and they don't shout all the time which is our beef with a lot of US children's programming. Also the animation is charming and the music is fabulous! Only drawback is that our little one has asked us to provide her with a big brother like Charlie, which I don't think we'll be able to do..

Highly recommended. I'm just about to buy vol. 2",1159228800,5,908,4.304093567251462
2583612,5,B000FS2VQI,"My daughter LOVES Charlie and Lola.  She was 2 (now 3) when we first started to see them on the Disney Channel and was instantly drawn to them.  My husband also loves them.  I am American and my husband is British so it was great to have a show where they talked like Daddy.  Lola is so funny and my daughter mimics her and has actually picked up the accent a bit (which my husband loves) She loves to say ""never ever eat a tomato"" which is funny b/c tomatos are one of her favorite foods. It is nice to see a bit of her father's culture introduced here.  She eats a lot of the food that they talk about on the show (like sausage rolls and marmite sandwiches) and has even started  calling the dog Sizzles. My 17 month old son is even starting to get into it.  We have taped all of the episodes off of the tv but have been hoping for a DVD so we can play it in the van. We have bought the books and even got some sticker books from the UK when my mother in law went back this past spring.

As far as the show itself, it is a creative animation which conformed from books to tv rather well. It touches on many subjects from not getting the staring role in the school play to waiting for the first snow. Keeping with the Snoopy tratition, you never seem to see grown ups. It is all from the prespective of the 4 & 7 year old.  It is captivating entertainment for your pre-schooler. I give it 5 stars.",1152144000,23,1398,4.036231884057971
2583613,5,B000FS2VQI,"I am using my Gramp`s account. I used to love Lauren Child`s Charlie and Lola TV program from watching it on Playhouse Disney and reading the colorful books. This series is not really well-known in the United States of America. It has more popularity in England. Before owning this DVD, I would have to watch episodes that were recorded to a VHS tape. A relative gave me this DVD, when I was at least 3 or 4 years old. I love the interactive games and episode choice menu. I recommend this DVD for all ages. I would let this product get away with 5 stars.",1416700800,,555,4.295238095238095

2583615,5,B000FS2VQI,"I have come to rely upon British television for quality programming and the program ""Charlie and Lola"" is one of the reasons why. My 3-year-old adores it -- even though it is completely lacking in explosions or CGI. It is well-written, clever and kind -- it teaches without trying too hard. Best of all, in my opinion, it models a WONDERFUL sibling relationship between the older brother ""Charlie"" and the little sister ""Lola"" (""who is small and quite funny"").",1404691200,4,460,4.8354430379746836

2583617,5,B000FS2VQI,This is just absolutely the cutest little series. I love how they are so nice to each other instead of shouting or fighting all the time like you usually see siblings portrayed these days. And my kids love them to as they are very entertaining and they can wait to find out what Lola is going to do next or how Charlie is going to help her with whatever problem she may have. Lots of fun!,1396310400,,388,4.118421052631579

2583619,5,B000FS2VQI,i love this series. i would buy them all up if i could. i think this series is a refreshing non-aggressive fun cartoon that teaches patience and sibling bonding. and i honestly think it is good for boys or girls.

2583621,5,B000FS2VQI,Charlie and Lola are the rare brother and sister combo in cartoons that like each other and generally get along. I love how supportive Charlie is with his irrepressible sister. Look for the  books that correspond with the episodes.,1387929600,,231,4.923076923076923

2583623,5,B000FS2VQI,"The Charlie and Lola series are a mom pleaser! The show is about a brother and sister and get this, the siblings actually get along and help each other out. I cringe every time my children watch a show when the siblings are cruel or rude to each other. I'd much rather support happy family relationships portrayed on children's television. They also have cute British accents, as this is a British children's series. Bonus!",1376524800,,423,4.72972972972973

2583625,4,B000FS2VQI,"My grandkids and I watched most of this show today.  This was our first time viewing it.  I had never heard of this show, and are always looking for something educational and fun for them to view.  My grandson liked the episodes about Lola's eating vegetables, and taking care of their dog.  The siblings are kind and happy with one another in the show.  All the other characters are kind and fun to watch as well.

The video shows really well.  There are extras also included.  Though a cute show, I feel that it still has to grow on my grandchildren.",1367884800,,552,4.396039603960396

I LOVE Charlie and Lola!  I got these DVDs for my toddlers and they love them too.  By 4 yr old is especially fond of the spider episode.  This is such a great value, because you get so many episodes as opposed to the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse videos where you get like 2 or 3.",1294790400,,450,4.068181818181818
2583635,5,B000FS2VQI,"LOVE the Charlie and Lola shows. The animation is fun and simple, including photos of real objects alongside the chalk-style outlines of characters and objects. The kids' voices are cute, and I like that my kiddo hears a British accent in addition to the American English spoken at home. The shows on Disc One are not educational per se but each episode is fairly short in terms of dialogue, while including plenty of non-talking parts showcasing Charlie and Lola's fantasy images of outer space, the pyramids of Egypt and a cake-baking Dachshund, to name a few.",1277337600,,562,4.864583333333333
2583636,5,B000FS2VQI,charlie and lola are too cute for words. they speak proper English which helps little ones learn the right words for the right moment instead of those baby talk shows on now days (you know what im talking about)and they also teach children very important lessons on being a brother and a sister which was perfect for my nephew and niece.,1273190400,,337,4.540983606557377

2583640,5,B000FS2VQI,"My 2 year old loves Charlie & Lola, and this did not disappoint.  Great DVD, great storied, lots of wonderful imagination play.  My son giggles along with Lola all the time.  The one thing I would change is that the episodes have a tendency to loop and keep playing (as opposed to being able to play one at a time and have it stop at the menu).",1232323200,,344,4.104477611940299
2583641,5,B000FS2VQI,"This series has kind themes, and it subtly teaches children information about all sorts of things.  The siblings are loving and polite to each other as they explore the world around them.  They are also entertaining and funny in a light, quirky way.  The show fosters love between siblings and an openness to new things, like tomatoes or spiders, even if you thought you didn't like them. My 2 toddler daughters adored this show from the first moment.  The colors and music are soft, but happy.  A bonus is that the show is not annoying or tiresome for grown-ups.  I find myself pausing to enjoy it with them.",1222646400,,609,4.592592592592593

2583643,5,B000FS2VQI,"My daughter absolutely loves every episode on this dvd.  It is great show without violence, mean words, or teaching that girls (princesses) need to be rescued.  My daughter has the first three volumes as well as several of the corresponding books and does not tire of either.  I strongly suggest also the Charlie and Lola books - the illustrations are unique and top-notch, just like in the video.  I also suggest Lauren Child's ""Princess and the Pea"" book which I thought was wonderful.  I like her other books but they are still a little too old for my daughter who just turned four.

Some of the episodes teach useful lessons (especially concerning getting along with others) in a fun way, and other episodes are just fun.  I like that the kids entertain themselves with their imagination and that the shows are sweet without being too sweet.",1214092800,,845,4.7465753424657535

I highly recommend it. :)",1198627200,,375,5.714285714285714

2583646,5,B000FS2VQI,"This is one of the children's shows that I love to watch with my daughter. I really like the fact that it is voiced by actual children (rather than the usual voice-over actors), and having the British characters introduces a different culture and manner of speaking to children.

I also really like the fact that it does not use snark or sarcasm to get the point across or to entertain. Don't get me wrong - I love snark and sarcasm, but I'd really like to wait to introduce that to my toddler, you know?

Charlie loves his little sister Lola, and they have a healthy, loving relationship. He has no problem helping to look after her, and the fact that he will go to lengths to cheer her up and make her feel better is excellent to see.

The animation is cute, too. Not too busy, and not headache-inducing. Definitely a thumbs-up for small children...and their parents!",1190851200,2,869,4.522292993630574

2583649,5,B000FS2VQI,"""Charlie and Lola"" is the most delightful, endearing and humorous children's animated series. It is a brillantly simple protrayal of the imaginative world our children create.

As we are Brits living in America I also like the fact that they have kept the same voices that we heard in the UK.  It is an adaptation of the books by Lauren Child which have a quirky, gentle sense of humour.  I especially like the way that Lola is allowed to use childish constructions of language which I am sure is familiar to all parents of small children.  It is also a nice representation of a big brother looking after his smaller sister and finding inventive ways to negotiate tricky problems such as ""I don't like tomatoes, peas, carrots etc"".  I would recommend this product as we are all enjoying it.",1168300800,7,691,4.317829457364341
