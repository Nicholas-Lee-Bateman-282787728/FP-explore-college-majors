5056904,3,B00753MBCA,"The 1992 season on DVD is now available from Amazon, but the price is $27.83 instead of the original pre-release listed price of $19 and change.  However, if you compare the original description of the product to what is now available, the $19 product was said to have only one DVD while the new page says the package has two DVDs with 330 minutes of entertainment.  That should make things a little more palatable.

However, unfortunately, when I received the set I found that the BBC has seen fit to crop at least one of the episodes.  The last scene of Ordeal by Trousers is (or was) a classic.  Foggy gets a beetle down his pants and then gets conscripted with Compo and Clegg to perform at a church social function.  In the original version Compo takes the lead in singing ""I'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter,"" with Clegg and Foggy chiming in on the end of each line.  But as the song comes to an end Foggy becomes aware of the beetle in his pants, begins twitching his leg to get the beetle out of his trousers, and builds up to a frantic ""dance"" while the other two begin clapping to keep time with the piano music that accelerates to keep time with Foggy.  The scene is hilarious, one of the most memorable of the 35 year series.  But the BBC whittled it down to the point where you just don't have a chance to get into the mood.  Compo's singing is cut completely and instead of Foggy building up gradually to a crescendo in his frantic dance, he starts out abruptly at the peak and only jumps around for a few seconds, leaving the viewer with no time to appreciate the humor of the impromptu show.  Really a let down for those who considered this episode in its original form a pinnacle of comic entertainment.  I'm so glad I video taped the original, even if at this point my tape is showing wear from repeated use.",1344124800,13,1845,4.346938775510204

From the press release:

""Clegg, Compo and Foggy are back for another season of hilarious jokes, tricks, and mix ups!
Compo outfits himself in biker's leathers after he overhears that Nora likes a man in riding gear. Unfortunately, she meant horse riding... Wesley has plans to convert a lawnmower into a window cleaning machine, but, as always for this trio, the invention doesn't work as smoothly as expected. Clegg attempts to prove Foggy a liar with what he calls the classic ""Ordeal By Trousers,"" which entails dropping a beetle down the front of his pants to see if Foggy flinches. If he does, he's lying. Hoping to get rich quick, Compo becomes a one-man band. Later, when Foggy buys a camcorder and practices filming in the hills, he catches more than just nature on his film...Foggy also invents a new form of transport with a giant wheel and Compo finds himself volunteered as its first test driver. In the Christmas Special, the trio hires an inflatable castle for the seasonal parade, but not without a few hilarious mishaps along the way.""

Episodes this time out are:

1. By The Magnificent Thighs of Ernie Burniston - Howard asks Clegg to deliver a birthday card to Marina, and Foggy decides that it's time Compo got fit.
2. Errol Flynn Used to Have a Pair Like That - Compo finds out that Nora likes a man in horse-riding gear.
3. The Phantom of the Graveyard - An old school teacher of the trio has died, so the lads are off to his funeral.
4. The Self-Propelled Salad Strainer - Wesley has plans for a ride-on lawnmower. He's going to adapt it for the purpose of cleaning windows.
5. Ordeal by Trousers - Ivy and Nora are looking for volunteers for the church concert, and, suspicious about the truthfulness of Foggy's war stories, Compo and Clegg use an old school challenge to root out liars on him.
6. Happy Birthday, Howard - Marina asks Clegg to deliver a birthday present to Howard. It'd be an easier job, if the present weren't a giant cuddly panda.
7. Who's Got Rhythm? - Compo is short of money, but after a flash of inspiration (and a visit to Auntie Wainwrights), he becomes a one-man band.
8. Camera Shy - Foggy buys a camcorder from Auntie Wainwright, and practices filming in the hills. He wants to watch it back, but doesn't have a video player. Luckily Pearl steps in and offers the use of her TV and video, but will it be lucky for Howard? Has Foggy captured more than just the countryside on tape?
9. Wheelies - Foggy invents a new form of transport...a giant wheel. Compo finds himself volunteered to test drive it.
10. 1992 Christmas: Special Stop That Castle! - The trio visit Auntie Wainwright, to rent a bouncy castle for the Christmas parade.

Yes, the Christmas special is again included.  Finally this seems to be the norm rather than separate releases.  Considering they tend to be in continuity it only makes sense.

Don't be surprised if you are lukewarm to LOTSW on first viewing. This gentle sitcom grows on you over time. The first time I saw LOTSW I was underwhelmed... it was slow and seemed almost without a plot. But after watching a few more episodes I was hooked!  It's somewhat like ""The Little Rascals"" with retired people and without the ""hey gang, let's put on a show"" episodes.

Now that a regular, faster, release schedule has been put in place my only complaint is that, like almost all titles from BBC/Warner, the releases are only ""reasonably"" priced during occasional sales.

*UPDATE*
This is now apparently a BBC America Shop Exclusive title.  The same is apparently true of ""Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1993"".  What a major let down!  Hopefully these will be available at Amazon in the near future which should help somewhat with the sticker shock pricing from BBC America.

**UPDATE #2**
BBC America has listened and by popular demand is releasing this title for general retail on July 3rd.  As of the date of this update Amazon does not have it listed but keep your eyes open, it should be listed soon!",1330041600,19,4218,4.845618915159944

5056910,5,B00753MBCA,"I love this show and would love it more if it wasn't for the annoyingly LOUD laugh track Yes, I know they famously didn't use a ""laugh-track"" per se; no, they recorded an audience watching the taped parts and used that - L O U D L Y !!! In some of the episodes the recorded laughter steps on the dialogue. I don't understand the why the execs or whomever thinks it is necessary to cue the audience to laughter. I have bought and watched almost the whole 38 year spanning series and have gotten to the point where I watch it now with my thumb on the Mute button on the remote. There is such a predictable pattern of canned laughs that I can usually time the ""mutes"" perfectly. What a pain. It is for this reason that I can't watch anymore of these. At least for awhile.
Otherwise, a very enjoyable easy-going show.",1432598400,,813,4.251612903225807

Well-written and timely shows which will never be too old-fashioned for most of us.  Our favorites are, of course, Nora and Compo, but Auntie Wainwright is unbelievably entertaining.

The antics of the old men never fail to make me laugh. Foggy's expressions and wild schemes with Compo's unrequited love for Nora combined with Clegg's play on words are so lovable one never tires of watching the DVD's. The other characters fill out the show, like Howard and Marina. Love to watch Marina walk!  LOL

5056945,3,B00753MBCA,"I absolutely love this show and I especially love the trio of Compo (Bill Owen), Clegg (Peter Sallis) and Foggy (Brian Wilde)! The writing in this 1992 series may not be quite as well done as the earlier episodes but I may just be nitpicking, because they are still funnier than most other comedies ever produced! When I say funny I mean that they allow the humor to seep into your soul gently and naturally. They are not thrown in your face or laced with vulgarity. The Yorkshire scenery is just a beautiful as ever, and the supporting characters add humor and charm to an already hilarious trio of the most ""irresponsible barmpots"" in all of England! I do have a complaint (and the reason for 4 stars not 5) about the DVD's for this whole series, and that is - there are no extras to allow the fan an inside look or to look behind the camera. A show of this quality deserves the very best marketing and the fans deserve the very best packaging! Come on BBC....don't short-change this classic treasure!

Edit: I want to add something I have noticed. Some, not all, of the episodes have been edited and scenes cut short! This is sad and a bit disappointing. I only noticed it because I recorded many episodes off my local PBS satation prior to getting the dvd's. Was I surprised to find that the PBS episodes were longer and apparently complete, while several scenes were missing in the dvd! I have noticed this on all the LOTSW dvd's that the BBC has put out! Again, what a shame! I would have thought this series (and its fans) would get the very best treatment and packaging available! Shame on you BBC for selling such cheap and disrespectful versions of one of the greatest comedies ever created! For this I lower my rating from 4 to 3 stars..not for the show but for the poor treatment by the BBC!",1359244800,5,1803,4.447129909365559

Then why the three stars?  Again, as I stated in my prior review of another LOTSW set there is no insert to go with the DVD.  One would expect at the very least a listing of the episodes, date when aired, etc.  But there is NOTHING.  Even the back face of this set does not have a listing of much worth.  Now I paid over $27 for this set and I feel it is quite fair that I should be entitled to some documentation to complement the set.  As of today I have about twelve DVD sets of LOTSW.  Only ONE of them has some documentation.  So when I want to watch a particular episode I have to guess which DVD set to play.  For the price I expect better product presentation.
