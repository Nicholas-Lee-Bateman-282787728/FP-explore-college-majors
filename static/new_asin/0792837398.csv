144122,3,0792837398,"Wanda Nevada, 1979 film

The film begins in a watering place in Arizona in the early 1950s. There is a poker game in the back room. Two gamblers bet on a hand. One doesn't have enough cash to cover the bet so he offers a young girl who is a run-a-way from an orphanage. There is conflict over the winner, a gunshot settles the deal. Beaudray Demerol won the cash and the marker, the 13-year old girl. [A lucky number or just Jail Bait?] They leave quickly, then stop at a bar. An old prospector brags about finding gold in the Grand Canyon. ""Everybody knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon."" But Curly shows off his nuggets! When Curly leaves he drops a pouch with the nuggets, and a watching Wanda scoops it up. Two criminals follow Curly to rob and kill him. Wanda is seen watching them and flees with Beaudray. They are chased by the killers for the usual chase to provide action. Later Beaudray and Wanda stay at a motel where they discover a hidden map to the lost mine!

Beau trades his Studebaker for pack mules and supplies to try to find Curly's hidden mine. [They know exactly what they'll need.] The two killers are on their trail! Beau and Wanda stumble upon a rope ladder which is a clue to the cave hidden below the trail. Wanda was taught how to use a pistol. They find the veins of gold in the cave and pick up bags of nuggets. When the two killers find them there is a shoot-out at close range. Many shots are fired but no one is hit! The two killer run off. Will Beau and Wanda discard their winnings? They wake the next morning to find their mules missing. They have to walk out of the desert without food or water. Later they find the bodies of the two killers; someone has passed judgment on them. But Wanda and Beau find the gold nearby! [An amazing coincidence?] Then they find an old boat (!) that will carry them down the river to safety, even after an arrow wounds Beau. [You can't be too lucky in Hollywood movies.] Upon their return to civilization the orphanage tries to reclaim Wanda, but she runs off again to join Beau in his new car. Will they live happily ever after? In Hollywood!

The faults in this film is to present two killers as bumblers for comic relief. This is not a serious film, but a comic fantasy that plays with the characters as if this was a cartoon. Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" was filmed many times, and remains a popular story for children of all ages. Setting it in the past may help its credibility. I see this film as another version where a young orphan is able to become wealthy through good fortune and overcoming perils to grab the gold. No mention of taxes and government claims on the loot! This is a low budget version, no expensive equipment or cast of hundreds was needed.

I read a book about the Lost Gold Mines in Arizona. This 1950 book cautioned tourists against wandering away from their hotels unarmed. People who did this somehow disappeared without a trace. Was it just ""ghosts""?",1279152000,4,2974,4.401818181818181
144123,4,0792837398,"There was something very charming about this movie. I only wish there was a whole series of these films. ""The Adventures Of Wanda Nevada"". The VHS tape I purchased had some serious issues which detracted some of my enjoyment of the movie. Come on, when will the USA ever get a DVD release of this movie like Europe has?",1267401600,3,319,4.423728813559322
144124,4,0792837398,"This movie falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category. All  the actors are terrible, even Henry Fonda's cameo stinks. Some of the scenery is great, some is obviously phony. But somehow it is watchable, perhaps because you keep imagining what is being parodied, especially toward the end. Yet it gives one a twinge of regret when it's over.",1193529600,,339,4.745762711864407
144125,1,0792837398,I can only hope the Ms. Shields used the money she made from this film to take some acting lessons.  She REALLY needs them!!,1192492800,3,124,4.166666666666667
144126,5,0792837398,"I was 9 when this movie first came out and I loved it.  In my early teens when it started being ran on TV, I watched again (probably while wearing my Brooke Shields brand jeans!) and loved it.  And now (in my 30's), when it is being run on cable I still love it!  This movie is a great adventure, great western and is just great fun.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish it was available on DVD.",1174694400,16,395,3.949367088607595
144127,1,0792837398,"I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of ""romance"" and ""western"" with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in.  But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening.

Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her away at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple. It's revolting.

I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.",1151107200,5,747,4.730769230769231

144155,4,0792837398,"I doubt if this movie could be made today, with our seemingly increased Puritan attitudes about young people and sexuality.  Even though there is a coming-of-age theme running through the film, there is no overt sexuality.  In fact, the relationship between the two main characters is totally innocent.  Europeans don't have problems making movies like this, even exploring sexuality further, but here in America we seem to have regressed, to where I don't think a film like this would be accepted today.  The movie is a travel adventure, with the main characters running into different people along the way, as well as being chased by some bad guys.  In spite of some strange plot devices and editing (especially at the end), this is an enjoyable film anyone of any age should be able to watch.

I do have a question, though.  Does anyone have the Blu-ray import of the film, and is the video better than the DVD version?  The DVD is manufactured on DVD-R media as ordered, and states that is is made from the ""best available source material"".  That material isn't always very good.  The film has a too-soft look to it, and some scenes lose detail by suddenly becoming a bit dark.  I'm wondering if the Blu-ray version is better, or if it is just a transfer of the same source material to BD format.

Anyone?",1420502400,,1309,4.668122270742358
144156,3,0792837398,"Brooke Shields plays a teenage girl won in a poker game by a drifter, Peter Fonda. Together, they look for a mysterious gold mine in the Grand Canyon while developing a close connection. Left unclear, or perhaps, up to the viewer, is whether it's a father-daughter connection or something else. It's an unusual pairing in an adventure film with a touch of the supernatural. Otherwise it's fairly routine B-movie stuff. The image quality is fairly good throughout and we're unlikely to ever see this on Blu-Ray.",1417305600,,510,4.941860465116279
144157,5,0792837398,"This is one of the greatest movies every made; I watch it at least once a year; yes I know it is pure fantasy; why do you watch movies anyway, eh?

144168,2,0792837398,"This is a movie whose premise, while potentially slightly more socially acceptable in the waning years of the sexually liberated 70's, is nothing but creepy and pedophelic now.  Here's a brief and brutal synopsis:
Man wins 13 year old orphan girl (prostitute or sex slave?) from her current pedophile at poker game.
Man and girl go looking for gold in the grand canyon.
Man honorably keeps his hands (mostly) off tempting young girl.
Sexual tension develops between man and girl (13!).
Action and adventure ensue (with some brief but awesome 70's special effects!).
Man and girl get out of grand canyon with gold.
Girl is safely back in orphanage when man drives up in new car and whisks willing girl away to the dismay of the pursuing nuns.
While driving away man give girl new dress which girl changes into (in the backseat), presumably as a prelude to more pedo fun...

And no one saw anything wrong with this...?
The worst part, as another reviewer noted, was that all this creepy byplay was not unnecessary.",1416182400,,1012,4.777142857142858

144173,2,0792837398,"A gambler (Peter Fonda) wins a young teen in a card game and the mismatched pair find adventures that eventually lead them to a hunt for gold in the Grand Canyon.

It seems very likely that the material was reconfigured to accommodate the sexually charged image Brooke Shields was peddling early in her career (anyone remember The Brooke Book?).  Even though her character is merely thirteen years old a surprising number of male characters in the movie want to get in her pants.  The most impressive stylistic touch involves Shields' character storming off at a truck stop.  The camera follows her in a lateral unbroken shot as she passes a seemingly endless line of men standing in front of their vehicles propositioning her, trying to get her to join them for a little fun.  Later the gambler and Wanda encounter an eccentric bird watcher who turns out to be a pedophile.  Then they are pursued by two gangsters, one of whom mentions several times that when they catch the pair he gets the girl.  When his partner mentions that he's already been married three times the gangster replies that he doesn't plan on marrying her.

The weird thing is that if you remove the Brooke Shields as 13 year old sex-pot elements what you are left with is a family friendly adventure film that could have been made by Disney starring Kim Richards and Darrin McGavin.  The violence is so tame that during one shoot out between the gambler, Wanda and the two gangsters dozens of shots are fired but no one is actually wounded--bullets knock off hats and tear clothing but not a single one actually draws blood.

Wanda Nevada is ultimately undone by the limitations of its lead actress.  While Brooke Shields is likable enough, she doesn't manage a single honest emotional moment for her character during the entire course of the movie.  She seems content to be sassy, say her lines and hit her marks, but that isn't enough.  Since Wanda comes across as an obvious performance rather than a person it robs the movie of anyone to care about or root for.

Brooke Shields wasn't really a very interesting or resourceful actress, which is likely why her big-screen career fizzled completely after Endless Love tanked, despite the massive hype surrounding her.

Wanda Nevada is offbeat and has its moments, but its schizophrenic tone and the phony performance from Shields make it hard to recommend.",1398384000,6,2379,4.796568627450981
144174,5,0792837398,Absoutly the best Peter Fonda is a very good actor. And in this movie he is great all the way. Glad to have it on dvd and in my collection.,1397174400,,139,3.6666666666666665
144175,4,0792837398,"The film seemed different than I remember, but it had been a long time since I had seen it. In the past this video had been hard to get due to who put produced it.  I ordered this video mainly for the song that Carole King sung at its conclusion.",1389657600,2,246,3.92

144183,3,0792837398,"I have just ordered a DVD of this strange little film. The character that matters most to me is the 1950 Studebaker bullet-nose Commander which appears throughout. A good friend from high school and college years owned that car and leased it to the studio for this production. I was with him when he bought it from a lady in Whittier, CA, and booked thousands of miles in it as we cruised about aimlessly. Ah, youth! My friend permitted the the studio to repaint the car in yellow from its original Bell Telephone green and to install the windshield visor, circumstances I objected to at the time as it had been a totally original car. Jeez, who knows where this Studie is now? As things turned out my friend died young (1990) and his small car collection presumably was sold off by the family, but we sure had fun with our various Studebakers, VWs and BMW Isetta bubblecars while the 1970s lasted! Cars have never been as much fun since then. Enjoy the movie, it's a small film but watchable as I recall, for the petulant Brook Shields if nothing else.",1352160000,2,1053,4.518324607329843

144187,1,0792837398,"Billy Wilder famously said ""Audiences don't know somebody sits down and writes a picture; they think the actors make it up as they go along."" Well, ""Wanda Nevada"" sure looks as if it was made up by the actors, actors who had no idea what they were doing.

It's difficult to describe just how awful ""Wanda Nevada"" is, but if you can imagine a mash-up of ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Poltergeist"", and ""Lolita"" (yes), you'll have a rough idea. It also breaks one of Aristotle's primary rules about storytelling -- there's no necessary or plausible logic to the sequence of many of the film's events.

One of the worst films I've ever seen. You have been warned.",1282694400,,654,4.629310344827586
7792199,5,0792837398,Fun movie!,1520121600,,10,4.5
7792200,2,0792837398,"The cover art for Wanda Nevada gives viewers the impression that it's an adventure geared for children, however, a few minutes into the movie quickly reveals its true nature: brainless entertainment for galoots and yahoos. This movie revisits the exploitation of the extraordinary beauty of the budding Brooke Shields as sexual fodder for an endless string of lonely, depraved men. Shields portrays Wanda, a sassy orphan who could probably get by on her own, but is instead reduced to fractional poker winnings for a dull, card-playing vagabond, Beaudrey Demerille (played by Peter Fonda). Beau's exemplary moral character (quite unlikely for that of a drifter) prevents him from making sexual advances on his prepubescent prize. With Beau low on dough, Wanda serendipitously happens upon a map marking a spot in the Arizona hills supposedly rolling in gold.

The plot is too clichd and cartoonish to appeal to most adults. If it weren't for the sexual innuendoes, it would have been a typical adventure movie for children. The caricaturized duo of rubbery villains hot on Wanda and Beau's gold-seeking trail are certain to have viewers muttering, ""oh, come ONNN...gimme a feckin' break! This ain't the Disney Channel!"" Not surprisingly, the special effects are goofy, only to be believed by kids, with an ending even more implausible to adults considering what takes place in some of the last action scenes. Adding bad to worse, most of the cast are challenged in the acting department, namely Shields and Fonda, whose onscreen chemistry happens to be lacking some bunsen burners.

What kept me from giving Wanda Nevada the goodbye: a) the desert setting; b) vintage/retro accents and stylings; and c) the silly hope that at any moment, things could take a turn for the better. I can only recommend this movie to Shields and Fonda fans and lunkheads who can't make the distinction between high and low quality neo-pseudo-Westerns.",1513468800,,1931,5.146496815286624
