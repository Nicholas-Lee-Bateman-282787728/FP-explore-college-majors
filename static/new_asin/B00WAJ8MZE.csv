7127879,5,B00WAJ8MZE,"Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are but the start. Each of the rest of cast brings something special (although I really don't like Chris Elliot as the mayor). Very funny and in some episodes touching. Levy's real life daughter and son also star. His son plays David, his son on the show, and he is hilarious. Levy and his son created the show and wrote the first episode.",1462147200,5,372,4.485294117647059

8712678,5,B00WAJ8MZE,"such a wonderful show, deadpan and hysterical. Ms. O'Hara is shameless, Daniel Levy is a sprawling mess of disdain and snippiness, a great physical actor, and Annie Murphy takes that up a notch...Alexis is soooo much fun to watch, and I hope this show goes on for years so we can have more of her...those goony hands, spring-loaded face, how jaw-droppingly self-absorbed she is...she needs to have a row of statuettes for this. Great that it's gotten 3 seasons, hope there's many more.

well, except Chris Elliott. nobody likes him. but I'll allow it.",1491436800,,551,4.861702127659575

I watch this show on a weekly basis because that's how funny it is! Love having the DVD when I travel/go on vacation.  You will not be disappointed!
