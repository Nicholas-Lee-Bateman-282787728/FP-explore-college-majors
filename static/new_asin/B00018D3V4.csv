1976293,4,B00018D3V4,"The cinematography of this film is sparse and naked, the pacing as if you are following the tale of lives, the acting like there is no acting at all, and the subject matter relevant.  If you need edited and spliced quick action pacing and effects, go elsewhere.  If you care about the broadening of horizons and want to learn more about the experience of a middle-east refugee, watch this film.

Michael Winterbottom, the director of In This World, make some important choices.  One, his casting of actual refugees instead of professional actors, lend great authenticity to the story.  My favorite aspect of the movie is the location shooting in places rarely viewed by a Western audience.  The tale starts in a border refugee camp between Afghanistan and Pakistan outside of Peshawar.  A youth, brave and wise beyond his years, and an older relative take off on a journey to the promised land of London.  On the way they go through Quetta, Qom, Teheran, Turkey, Belgium, and eventually on to London.  The journey is grueling and harrowing and makes the refugee camp look like another form of paradise.

The pacing may be slow and there is a lot of silence in the movie but the sense of travel, trust and deserved mistrust stays with you.  People put their lives in the hands of human traffickers all for the dream of something better...if they survive to reach something better.

If you care about international issues of refugees and their plight, you will be rewarded by this film.  If you are interested in some of the dynamics between Afghanistan and Pakistan, you will be glad you took this one in.  If you only tend towards mainstream flicks and have a need to be entertained, well look elsewhere.

1976294,4,B00018D3V4,"This film tells the story of Jamal (Jamal Udin Torabi) and Enayat (Enayatullah), two young men who attempt the underground journey from a refugee camp in Afghanistan to London.  Both characters are played by real refugees, non-actors who actually lived the type of story portrayed here.  Director Michael Winterbottom followed the route taken by his protagonists, using guerilla filmmaking techniques such as filming in the actual locations, reportedly recording people, at times, when they did not know that they were being filmed.  Night scenes were shot with night vision equipment and appear to show confrontations with actual border guards; the black-and-white photography of these sequences, in which the characters eyes seem to glow in the dark, takes on a nightmarish quality.  Some may find the film slow--it does not develop its characters in a traditional way through scenes and dialogue, but shows their qualities through the tenacity and courage that they display during their trip.  The constant motion and eerie musical score contribute to a hypnotic, trance-like feel that imbues its characters with a sense of being entirely consumed with their journey from a dismal past into an uncertain, frightening future.  The scene in a shipping container is particularly harrowing.  The only sour note comes at the very beginning; Winterbottom mentions US responsibility for the plight of many Afghan refugees without acknowledging the complicity of the Taliban as well.  Nevertheless, this is not an overtly political film, but rather a very human and intimate one about the terrible risks people are willing to take to get to a land of opportunity./",1090108800,4,1659,5.329501915708812
1976295,5,B00018D3V4,"Aguirre, the egomaniac and mad conquistador embarked on a harsh and dangerous journey through the dark, hostile and uninviting jungles of Peru to look for his Eldorado, the city of gold.
In our time, and more realistically, determined and courageous people embark on a similarly harsh journey through land and sea to find their Eldorado,the land of opportunities.
In This World,the underrated masterpiece of British director Michael Winterbottom (Butterfly Kiss, Jude,The Claim 24 Hour Party People)is a film that goes with two young men on such a journey, from the Afghan refugee camps of Peshawar in Pakistan to London.
What is striking about this movie first of all is the fact that it is the first feature that follows the journey of illegal immigrants from start to finish. We have seen some very good examples of films that deal with the plight and conditions of refugees in various countries,like Majidi's Baran, Frears's Dirty Pretty Things, or Kechiche's La Faute A Voltaire, but never had a director approached this highly sensitive issue with such intimacy,and detail before:
He takes the viewer along this journey, step by difficult and dangerous step.
Moreover,the issue of illegal immigration has occupied many a headline in the media recently leading to a near hysteria of anxiety and fear about the coming 'flood' to Europe. While undoubtedly there is a problem, Winterbottom manages with his film to be the 'other voice', the one of compassion, sympathy and understanding,putting names,stories and faces to these people: an achievement he should be praised for.
The use of digital camera, some grainy shots and fast editing, all add a gritty realism, while the soft focus and beautiful scenery add a dreamy atmosphere that somehow reflect the dream that drives these people.
I was surprised how quickly I connected and sympathized with our two heroes, Jamal Udin Torab,and Enayatullah, themselves total amateurs and refugees (it reminded me of Iranian directors and how they have excelled in using complete amateurs with stunning results),and I anxiously followed them, and hoped for their safe arrival!! This is all due to the wonderful direction of Winterbottom.
There are some very powerful scenes,and the one inside the truck was truly haunting!!
We take so much for granted unfortunately, and most are lucky to associate the word 'journey' with a holiday, but there are others in this world, for whom this word means the difference between desolation and hope,and even life and death ,one they are willing to take no matter how high the cost is.
I am only grateful that Michael Winterbottom has taken that same journey with his camera, and with an eye that is totally involved and compassionate invited me in the safety of my own home to embark on it too..Do Not Miss It!",1082851200,5,2793,5.073913043478261
1976296,5,B00018D3V4,"Just saw Michael Winterbottom's compelling new movie In this World. In it, two young Afghani men Enayat and Jamal attempt to make it from Peshawar, Pakistan to London, England via a human smuggling operation. It's a rigously realistic portrayal, essentially a fictional documentary, cinema verite shot in digital video. Winterbottom packs a lot in as Enayat and Jamal pass through a dizzying array of cities and cultures on their way towards . . . tragedy. The little help they receive along the way, they receive warily, wisely unsure whether to trust any who offer it.
The films opens with some facts:
>The United States spent almost 8 billion bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan
>Many Afghanis moved to Peshawar to avoid the bombing--and, I'm sure, because many were made homeless
>There are 14 million refugees in the world
>1 million of them are in Peshawar
Providing this already stunning movie with even more impact: the character of Jamal is portrayed by a young Afghani named Jamal who really made the journey himself. Winterbottom and his crew took him back to Peshawar where they recreated the story, a story anyway of a similar journey, simply by asking people to relive their experiences.
In this World deserves notice, and Winterbottom deserves, not an Academy award--those come too cheaply--but some sort of humanitarian award for drawing attention to the subject. (It did win the Golden Bear, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the Peace Film Prize at the 2003 Berlin Film Festival.) I wish everyone who arranged and executed the bombing of Afghanistan could see it. We may be able to justify the freeing of the Afghani people from the treacherous Taliban, but can we really justify the lack of attention we're giving the innocents affected by that campaign?
If you've never seen any of Winterbottom's films, I recommend you see, well, all of these as well: Welcome to Sarajevo, Wonderland, The Claim, and 24 Hour Party People. I've also heard that Jude is excellent--both Jude and The Claim are based on Thomas Hardy novels (Jude, the Obscure and The Mayor of Casterbridge respectively).
Also, for an excellent, yet ultimately sobering movie set in Afghanistan before the fall of the Taliban, see Osama, a tragedy which depicts a 12-year-old girl who poses as a boy in order to earn money from her widowed mother and grandmother. I saw both movies within the past week, and together they provide an extraordinary glimpse at the harrowing existence our fellow humans endure in Afghanistan.",1081641600,6,2506,4.997607655502392
1976297,5,B00018D3V4,"In this World deals with the struggles faced by people in third world countries who set out in search of a better future.
The two main characters leave their Afghani refugee camp in Pakistan to travel to London, where their uncle has arranged a better life for them. Along the way they pass through several countries, including Iran, Turkey and France, just to name a few.
The acting? Incredible. The cinematography? INCREDIBLE. The political message? Great. Although Winterbottom avoids political rhetoric for most of the movie, it is clear that the desperate situation the refugees are put in is a direct result of America's ""war on terror""
This movie will move you in a million different ways, and will make you truly feel for those less fortunate than you IN THIS WORLD.",1080345600,4,774,4.871212121212121

8007734,5,B00018D3V4,A touching and moving film about the blight of refugees - just as relevant today as when it was filmed. A must see!,1408924800,,115,4.043478260869565
8007735,4,B00018D3V4,"Be warned; don't watch this film with a strong moral view regarding immigration legal or otherwise this is simply the story of what many go through in order to reach the west.

We hear every day (in Europe at least) of illegal immigrants 'flooding the country' but we know almost nothing about them.  This film goes some way to answer that question.  Many are simply economic migrants rather than fleeing persecution in their homeland and many are arriving on our shores for no other reason that financial.

We see in the film how they bribe their way across Pakistan to Iran, how they change their clothes to 'blend in' with the locals, taken from there to South East Turkey (the smugglers heartland of that country) where they stay with Kurdish smugglers, passed on to sweat shops in the big cities they work until being shipped off to Europe.

The actors are genuine not least because they are migrants from their homeland its an interesting insight into the people we see everyday.  From those begging or street vending in the big cities to working in the back of restaurants or on building sites.

Recommended film.",1183420800,2,1120,4.742268041237113
8007736,3,B00018D3V4,"I feel that the words ""gripping documentary film"" is inacurate for two reasons. I would not quite call it a documentary, as it is all reinactment, and, secondly, I think ""gripping"" is a stretch. I always welcome a chance to be reminded of the realities of life for those in less priveledged societies, but I felt that was really the most that this movie offered.",1176076800,2,362,4.584615384615384
8007737,5,B00018D3V4,"Terrific film, realistic and informative, and dramatic without being overly dramatic. Shot like a documentary, and usually with the slower pace of a documentary, too. It shows you how difficult the journey really is, it shows you a little of what the cultures are like, compared with each other, it shows you what the land looks like. It's also a great variation on the road picture.",1127865600,,383,4.818181818181818
8007738,5,B00018D3V4,"I watched this movie with a lump in my throat.  While I can understand how to some people, this film may have lacked some background information, to me, it was just perfect.  The subject is not uncommon, the characters only wanted a better life, and as someone mentioned, they did not care about politics and money, as most people don't, contrary to popular believes.  The movie concentrated on the journey and nothing else.  I loved every minute of the movie no matter how uncomfortable it was.  I was touched by the humanity of the people and I am grateful that the director didn't squeeze any emotionally charged moment, because simply put, I would have bawled.  I am not sure I care about the presentation of the movie as much as I care about the point it drove home and this was far more superior to anything else.",1124496000,,819,4.537414965986395
8007739,5,B00018D3V4,"This movie is powerful and shot in such a way that it feels real. This movie gives us the perspective of two Afghan refugees who want to get from Pakistan to London, and reveals the danger and risk of such a long journey. I highly recommend this movie as it gives us a small peek into the hazardous journey that many many refugees try to make every year.",1124150400,,354,4.220588235294118
8007740,4,B00018D3V4,"This is a fascinating film and well worth watching.

The human smuggling drama unfolds steadily with a few good plot twists, as the 2 main characters trek across two continents (mostly by land) toward their destination (London).  Streamlined film-making on location, combined with the use of very talented untrained actors, makes the ""movie"" seem more like a well-done, dramatic documentary.  The surround sound also heightens the ""realism"" of the journey and is excellent.

If you want to increase your enjoyment of the film, I strongly recommend that you take an extra hour or so to watch the behind-the-scenes featurette, director's commentary, and trailers.  Although it's been mentioned that the both ""actors"" are not professionals, by watching these special features the viewers discover that the young man who played the part of Jamal (real name of Jamal Udin Torabi) has been trying to gain status in the UK as a legal alien.  That ""revelation"" further heightens the emotional impact and socio-political importance of this excellent film.",1101427200,2,1046,5.3090909090909095
8007741,5,B00018D3V4,"Motivated by a news story about 58 Chinese immigrants found suffocated in a container at Dover, In This World by Michael Winterbottom is a passionate tribute to the nearly one million refugees a year who are willing to take enormous risks to seek a better life. Winner of the Golden Bear at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival, the film follows two boys, Jamal, 16 (Jamal Udin Torabi) and his older cousin Enayat (Enayatullah) on a perilous overland journey from an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan to seek economic security in the West. Shot in documentary style with a digital camera strapped to the back of cinematographer Marcel Zyskind, the film is fictional but is drawn from a true story and mirrors the desperate conditions of untold thousands whose faces we never see.

The boys are Pashtun who have grown up at the Shamshatoo refugee camp in Pakistan along with 53,000 other Afghanis, victims of the Russian-Afghan War or the American war against the Taliban. The politics of the refugees are not discussed and the film is basically a human story that crosses political and religious lines. Since Jamal speaks some English, Enayat's family asks him to go with him to London where he can apply for asylum as a refugee. From Peshawar, Jamal and Enayat travel by bus to Quetta and over the Iranian border to Taftan and by bus to Tehran. They do not have proper identification and must contend along the way with border guards, police, thieves, smugglers, and numerous changes in currency and language.

The boys bribe a customs officer with a Walkman but when ordered off a bus to Tehran, they meet a group of Kurds who offer them the hand of friendship. There is not much dialogue and the boys mostly improvise the funny stories and small talk as they endure days and weeks of waiting for their next ride. In a sequence of great beauty shot at nighttime using infrared photography, the Kurds help the two boys cross the icy mountains to Turkey, ducking the gunfire of armed soldiers at the Turkish border. Together with an Iranian and his wife and baby, they are then brutally forced to travel inside a shipping container for a 40-hour voyage from Turkey to Italy, a journey where only the strong survive.

In This World is not just a road movie but a human document of urgency and commitment that allows us to experience the humanity of the people some contemptuously refer to as ""economic migrants"" or ""asylum seekers"". While it is not a political statement, it is clearly a slap at the recent hardening of European immigration policies. On a broader scale, however, the film can be seen as an apt metaphor for life. It tells us that the journey is exhilarating but fraught with unimagined obstacles at every turn, yet there are friends who are there for us along the way and, when we feel overwhelmed and hopeless, there is an aching beauty that fortifies us with the strength to keep going.",1101340800,2,2909,4.733727810650888
8007742,3,B00018D3V4,"Michael Winterbottom's In This World is basically a sort of documentary-cum-drama where we follow a real Afghan boy as he travels from a refugee camp in Pakistan to hopefully a better life in London. While the boy's journey is real, much of the dialogues and many of the characters are largely scripted. That blending of fiction and reality makes for a strange viewing experience, because some scenes are staged, shot, and edited in the manner of a conventional narrative film, while other scenes invoke the more traditional documentary style. Aside from that, the journey itself is harrowing and dehumanizing, and makes you look at those who decide to make the dangerous trip very differently. Surprisingly, Winterbottom didn't really try to make any political statement with the film, except maybe at the end. He instead simply tells this one story as part of our collective human experience. The film lacks the realistic immediacy because it's not exactly a documentary, but it's still well worth checking out.",1098662400,2,1013,5.1454545454545455
