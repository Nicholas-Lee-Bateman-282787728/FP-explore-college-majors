8299734,5,B001EWVDCW,"I just watched this film. It was poignant and very mind blowing. I have seen too many of many friends waste away and commit suicide for reasons only known to them. For those who think you can keep on running away from past issues in your life please heed the warning. Stop now before it's tooo late. All of us want to have the loving relationship with someone male female gay , straight , black white green or purple. What we must first do is the start by loving our selves.  Most of us want and have a need to belong to something.  It is only human to want to to be a part of something in this world. What we don't realize is that before we can invite another person in to our lives we must be whole. Drugs , Lifestyle, your environment play a part in deciding where your life is gonging. Placing blame  will keep you stuck repeating the process until you learn from your past misfortune. Stop listening to what others say you ought to do ! Sit down go with your gut feeling change your life. You can't fix anyone else but YOU.......! Buy this dvd it is not DRAMA , this is a reality check...! Pay attention, you just might see yourself somewhere through out the film.",1362268800,2,1169,4.233183856502242

Some of the acting wasn't that great. All in all it was a good movie had some sad sides to it as well. I would recommend to everyone.",1260316800,2,276,3.8596491228070176
