8260685,5,B00161AMXM,"Gloria Swanson was an extremely cool woman. Not only was she a fantastic actress, but a pioneer in promoting health and educating the public on the harm of pesticides. I respect her immensely for that, and fans should definitely check out her autobiography Swanson on Swanson.

This DVD includes two Swanson films. Though the prints are not particularly pristine, Grapevine video was at the mercy of what they could get. Still, these are two rare movies and it is a treat just to watch them. Kino will be releasing Manhandled on blu-ray sometime early next year so be on the look out for that. Great product!",1512086400,,608,4.735849056603773
