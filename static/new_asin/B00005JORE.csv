1542119,1,B00005JORE,"I wish I had waited to have read the reviews before purchasing this DVD. However, I was excited to finally see it offered and pre-ordered. The quality is akin to an old VHS tape - fuzzy, soft, pan-and-scan and not the wide-screen treatment it deserves. 20th Century Fox ought to be ashamed of themselves for releasing a film like this in such condition. Blah!",1363046400,33,359,4.625
1542120,3,B00005JORE,"I regret to note that this is another pan and scan effort from our friends at Fox.
Please note that I have the Spanish version which is in its origanal 2.35 ratio.
As I have commented before on Fox pan and scan horrors, many are available from Spain
in their original 2.35 ratio.
If you refer to my review under Fraulein, you will find a comprehensive list of Fox
releases available from Spain.",1362614400,17,394,4.410958904109589
1542121,1,B00005JORE,"This wonderful film has an old transfer - it is Panned and Scanned with a 4:3 aspect ratio.
It is outrageous for Fox Archives to publish this movie without a good widescreen transfer.
Contrast this release with Warner Bros. Archives:  I have dozens of their titles, all correctly
transferred.",1362528000,40,292,4.959183673469388
1542122,1,B00005JORE,"Once again, a previously-unavailable-on-DVD widescreen movie title is offered for purchase through the Fox Cinema Archives made-on-demand DVD program.  And as per usual, it's pan & scan.  ""Tender is the Night"" has a proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The vintage poster art on the DVD case even advertises ""CINEMASCOPE"".  And yet, the customer gets a 4:3 (1.33:1) picture, which has 43 percent of every proper frame of the movie chopped off to fill the screen of a television you no longer own, in order to appeal to a very small fraction of the people who would be interested in this product.  My question is, why does Fox do this with this program?  Is it that widescreen versions of these movies don't exist?  Or is it they do exist, but Fox doesn't care enough to bother making them available, and we're just being offered stuff from the old VHS vault, slapped onto DVDs?  Either way, this isn't the way the Warner Archive Collection, Sony Choice Collection, or Universal Vault Series treat widescreen MOD releases.  And even the defunct MGM Limited Edition MOD program, which had its problems, generally gave widescreen movies a widescreen presentation (although often non-anamorphic).  I'd rather these titles don't get released at all, with an explanation that the material wasn't available to produce a sufficient quality DVD presentation, instead of these shoddy releases.  I will be returning my copy.",1362528000,35,1408,5.0519480519480515

1542126,3,B00005JORE,"F. Scott Fitzgerald isn't the best basis for a glossy 50's CinemaScope soap opera, but that doesn't mean you won't get a trashy melodrama that is definitely worth the wallow.  Jennifer Jones and Jason Robards almost play themselves here, and the location work is impressive.  The sassy and uber sexy Jill St. John is a plum asset, and there is a moody Bernard Herrmann score that's better than the picture.  Hardly a waste of time, but sadly, this streaming version is a worthless 4:3, pan-and-scan version, albeit with fine DeLuxe color and the original 4-track stereo mix.",1293840000,30,574,4.896907216494846
1542276,1,B00005JORE,This is the kind of movie that gives Hollywood a bad name.  I can't believe that Henry King directed. And of course fifties movies were incapable of recreating the twenties.,1466726400,,173,4.766666666666667
1542277,2,B00005JORE,"Jennifer Jones and Joan Bennet make a true effort and are lovely. Costumes and settings are highly watchable but don't waste your money on this one. I just finished the novel and while that is worth a second read, they did a poor job of translating it into a film.

1542282,4,B00005JORE,The scenery is terrific!  Is it still there?  In the beginning the sage old doctor said now you're the boss.  In the end she will be the boss and you will be sunk.  I think that's what he said.  Something like that.  I can hardly believe the book ended so abruptly in such an unfeeling manner.  Plot development is dreadfully boring.  Now you see it...now you don't.  Cute to see the early version of Jason Robards jr. who reminded me of George w. Bush.  A drunk of course.  The young women did a lovely job of acting.  The old women were stereotypes.,1440892800,,551,4.294117647058823
1542283,2,B00005JORE,"Don't let this movie ruin the exquisite novel for you,  I understand at least one reason why Fitzgerald drank (they wrecked his screenplay) Let's  pretend we can restore Fitzgerald to top guy as writer/director..  As for
Jason Robards - brilliant actor- nonetheless, he would get fired as Dick Diver.. The role cried out for the poetic and romantic Leslie Howard..( Remember him as Ashley from ""Gone With the Wind""?).  Ann Bancroft  should have played  his wife and, hey, let's cast  Marilyn Monroe as the young movie actress. And at last we've got a genuine Tender is the Night""!;",1434412800,,581,4.86734693877551

1542353,2,B00005JORE,"The book can be somewhat confusing and the movie duly clears that up, but the casting of Robards is unfortunate. Our first sight of him is in a bathing suit. The director did try to cover the actor's weak shoulders somewhat with a robe, but at first glance, too late, gone was our seeing him as a romantic hero. His shortcomings are somewhat overcome in the latter part of the story when his character becomes the fading, ""kept"" older husband in an affair with the same woman who is now a worldly and wealthy actress. Jennifer Jones was marvellous as the dusky, mad beauty whose eyes reveal everything that roils in her dark mind. The costumes and setting were true enough, but other casting was a little weak, too. Robard's lover at the start, did not have that delicate ingnue actress quality. On the other hand, the drunken pal who played the haunting title song on the piano, was perfectly done. It bothered me, however, that someone doing the set, would think to place a wrecked upright piano on the view patio of an elegant pink villa in the Rivera. And what about rain? It must rain sometime.  After seeing, and buying to treasure, the perfect ""Great Gatsby"" film of old with Mia Farrow et al, this Fitzgerald one was a bit of a disappointment.",1401753600,,1251,4.56
1542424,4,B00005JORE,"Beautiful cinematography, costumes,  and sets, especially the interior of the French Villa, highlight this 1960's melodrama set in Europe in the 1920's and  based upon the Fitzgerald novel of the same name.

The story revolves around Dr. Dick Diver played by Jason Robards Jr. and Nicole Warren played by Jennifer Jones. It opens mid-point in the marriage of the two as they frolic at the Riveria in France. Later in a lengthy flashback  he is a psychiatrist working in a private clinic in Zurich, Switzerland while she is an extremely wealthy (stock market) American patient there suffering from what appears to be some form of paranoid schizophrenia or phobia.  With hints of childhood abuse in her background we realize that Nicole has a latent and destructive fear of men.

Against the warning of an older and wiser college played by the great Paul Lukas he marries the girl and continues the ""cure.""  In time we see the warning played out against a background of excessive drinking, partying, and loss of purpose for Dick while Nicole gradually becomes sane and resolutely disturbed by his behavior.

Where once she was weak now she is strong.  Where once he was strong now he becomes weak.  One scene where their little girl becomes poisoned when she sips alcholic drinks from what was left in the guests' glasses after a house party becomes nearly tragic.  This and the senseless death of Abe North,(played convincingly by Tom Ewell),  their alcoholic former composer friend, leads Dick to decide to return to the clinic in Switzerland where Dick feels getting back to work will give him a life again.

From there it is all downhill for the marriage as we continue to witness the downfall of a tragic hero comparable to, but not exactly like, Gatsby in Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby.""  It's not hard to tell who Dick really is..shades of Fitzgerald, Abe--combination of Hemingway and Cole Porter and Nicole, of course, is based upon Fitzgerald's wife, Zelda.

The story is the reason to watch and buy this DVD.  Robards is generally miscast in the role of Dr. Diver.  Jill St. John, then in her early twenties and pre-Bond girl days, is just plain bad as Rosemary who worships Dick and later dismisses him abruptly from her life.  She, like Nicole, has loved him through rose colored glasses.  Tom Ewell, as Abe, has some noticeable moments and terrific lines.  He is the sarcastic, dissipated, and depressed ex-great who lives on the coat tails of the Divers.  Unfortunately we are never given clarity about how he dies and in what way. That among other things are left to our imagination, although I think the book would be much clear on that.  I read it so many years ago I simply can't remember.  Jennifer Jones, does Nicole well, especially in her  transformation of character and personality.  The ending scene is virtually hers as is most of the movie. She leaves us not exactly sorry for her but certainly sad.  This woman has been transformed and in that, reflects something almost surreal and surely bigger than life itself.  We are left with the thought that Dick's love has healed her at the expense of his own character decline. Ah, Zelda and Scott!

Supporting roles add to this drama including Joan Fontaine as Nicole's older sister, Baby Warren.  No one ever puts this baby in a corner.  She is rich, powerful, and determined to control her sister's life.  Much from their past sibling rivalry is never quite resolved.  In the end Baby convinces Nicole not to go after Dick as he drives away from the Villa and out of Nicole's life leaving the two children behind who he insists should think that he is simply gone for a while.",1383177600,2,3651,4.773524720893142
1542425,5,B00005JORE,"Good movie, good story. A Dr should not marry is patient. especially a very rich one. Great movie no bad words no xexy scenes just a good story that lets you use your imagination.",1381363200,,179,4.294117647058823

1542427,1,B00005JORE,"The casting in the film, Tender Is The Night, was totally wrong.  Jason Robards as Dick Diver was one of the worst casting decisions.  That role would have been perfect for Robert Redford just based on looking like the Dick Diver.  While Jennifer Jones is a superior actress, again, younger actress would have been more suited for the role.  I started to watch this film and then quickly stopped after just the first few beach scenes.  A waste of money and time.  Just read the novel!",1368662400,2,484,4.569767441860465

1542431,1,B00005JORE,"Fox releases DVDs of library titles to Europe taken from widescreen masters, then puts out the same titles domestically in a venue aimed at film buffs... in pan-and-scan??!
