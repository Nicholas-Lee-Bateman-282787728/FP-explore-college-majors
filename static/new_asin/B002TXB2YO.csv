8380768,5,B002TXB2YO,"This film is really 6 short stories about some ""urban myths"" from communist Romania. The film focuses on what life was like for different people in different situations, during the Ceaucescu era.

Each film gives a snapshot with a kind of moral to what life was like. I have worked and lived in post communist Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany during the early 1990's and Russia 2009 onwards. I have also visited virtually every other country of the Eastern Bloc including Romania. As such I gained a unique insight into the reality of what life was like behind the Iron Curtain before it disappeared. My first lesson to this surreal world was what I saw in the border town of Cheb Czechoslovakia in 1990. It was as if we had stepped back in time to the 1930's. Buildings falling apart, few goods in the shops, no advertising boards and blocks of flats that were grey and falling to pieces. Nobody looked happy and everyone looked so depressed. We were accosted all the time to barter goods for our DM as the Czech currency had no value. This experience is very similar to the Myth about the Chicken Driver and Seller of Air myths showing that goods were more valuable than money.

My next real encounter was in Schwerin, Eastern Germany in 1992. We were students studying at the University of Luneburg and we took a tour across the border to the old East. Walking from the castle to the town square we noticed that the bottom half of the buildings had been painted and were beautifully preserved, the top half run down, plaster missing and had not been painted. We asked the Guide why this was the case? The answer was Honecker had visited the town and sat in his limo whilst going to the Castle, as such he only saw the bottom half of the houses, so that was all that needed to be restored, this is similar to the first myth story of Ceaucescu's visit to a village.

Whilst studying for part of my MA at a Prague University in 1995 I saw the kind of fear a manager could instil within their workforce and how old thinking on what was politically right could slow progress to a logical conclusion. What I experienced was very similar to the myth about the Party Photographer.

Each story is a myth, yet I have either seen or heard of these stories actually happening in real life. With this in mind it is a terrific portrayal of how and what ordinary people had to do to survive behind the Iron Curtain. Some of the short films are quite funny, but most are quite sad and send a chill down your spine. It is hard to realise how much all aspects of peoples lives were so tightly controlled and regulated. It is a marvellous teaching aid for my USA University classes in International Relations to explain what life was like. Anybody thinking of using this DVD as a teaching aid, should also purchase the DVD The Lost World of Communism that perfectly dove tails into these myths.

I found the DVD fascinating, funny and sad. It is a great DVD to watch if you are interested in what life was like behind the Iron Curtain, although from my experience I would say it represents a portrait of truth rather than a film of urban myths.

Highly Recommended.",1375747200,,3153,4.493891797556719
8380769,5,B002TXB2YO,"Very interesting (the first two being very funny) short stories with subtitles for us english only speaking folks.  I especially enjoyed the first 2 movies. I think there was more truth to these stories than what the title says. You have to get this DVD and just watch it to really appreciate it.  The stories take place in Romania some as far back as 25 years or so.  I believe there are 6 different tales on the DVD. Again, this is not a big ""Hollywood"" production. It's very european in nature and a breath of fresh air in my book.",1356652800,,534,4.32
8380770,5,B002TXB2YO,"As a correspondent for U.S. newspapers, I arrived in Romania when the Communist-era system of lies and secrecy had completely collapsed. The chaos was unimaginable. My plane landed so soon after the 1989 revolution that no customs agents were left at the airport. The first government offices I visited were empty. Grocery store shelves were bare. I found many who dared to talk honestly for the first time in their lives.

So, I lapped up every minute of the 141-minute Tales of the Golden Age by Christian Mungiu and his Romanian filmmaking friends. (Mungiu wrote the scripts, then invited other young filmmakers to shoot the sequences.) Now in its complete form, the film is a series of comedic episodes about life under the half-crazed dictator Nicolai Ceausescu.

The Legend of the Official Visit, the opening vignette in the film, is the most amusing and fully realized of all these tales--and the scene depicted on the new DVD cover. Set in a remote rural village, the story turns on news that the dictator plans to make a personal visit by cruising through the town in his limousine. In scenes that recalled the early films of Federico Fellini, the town also is populated at the moment by a roving family that runs a colorful carousel. Suddenly, bureaucrats descend on the village, planning every last detail of the limousine's procession through the town's one dirt road--right down to the number of cows, vegetable stands and white pigeons that should be positioned along this road. In the end, great quantities of booze and a malfunction at the brightly colored carousel turn this little tale into a deft torpedo of Communist-era buffoonery.

As a journalist, I also loved The Legend of the Party Photographer, set inside the offices of the official government-run newspaper. It's a typical day in the newsroom as the editors meet to discuss front-page coverage of a foreign dignitary coming to meet with Ceausescu. Of course, this means that the photographers are expected to painstakingly alter their photos to give visual advantages to the fearless leader. A marvelous and mostly silent comic sequence shows what happens up and down the many layers of bureaucracy as the altered photos and stacks of newspapers spread across the entire nation--before someone discovers a fatal flaw in the final image. I laughed out loud.

Some reviewers compare this film unfavorably to Borat, arguing that this movie isn't as funny as Sacha Baron Cohen's 2006 savage mockumentary of life in former Communist countries. To those comparisons, I have to say: Yes, Borat was widely celebrated and even scored a nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. On balance, however, Borat painted Eastern Europeans as racist, sexist, homophobic and viciously insensitive to their own communities.

The rich humor in Tales from the Golden Age rests on the truth that, despite all the lies and secrecy of the Communist era--people did care about each other and tried to maintain lively families and neighborhoods. That's why these stories are so funny. Yes, many greedy and officious figures are skewered here, but the characters we care about in Tales from the Golden Age are good-hearted folks who we hope can win out in the end. The humor lies in the irrepressible nature of human hope.

Ultimately, that's the terrific gift to the world of this film by Cristian Mungiu and his colleagues Ioana Maria Uricaru, Hanna Hofer, Razvan Marculescu and Constantin Popescu. Bravo to the whole team for creating such a wondrously amusing slice of a now (thankfully) nearly forgotten world.",1330214400,8,3574,5.049152542372881
8380771,5,B002TXB2YO,"These six vignettes written by Cristian Mungiu of the famed ""4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days"" and directed by himself and four others begins in a rather silly vein with ""The Legend of the Official Visit"", but gradually moves to the more lengthy and oddly believable ""The Legend of the Air Sellers"" and then the extremely poignant and well-acted ""The Legend of the Chicken Driver"". This last segment makes all the others work in a profound way, pondering the sadness of materialism over human value and love, the conflict of political obedience over a natural love of material comfort, and to make it full circle, the reality of selfishness and fear over true camaraderie and compassion. The script of ""The Chicken Driver"" is sheer genius, exploiting the concept of natural ""profit"" and chickens. (I won' spoil the story.) This metaphorical richness weaves a brilliant story thanks in part to the subtle acting of Vlad Ivanov, star of ""4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days"", the excellent ""Police Adjective"", and most recently, the winner of the Golden Bear: ""Child's Pose"". Fittingly, humor, which runs the length and breadth of the 2 1/2 hours, jumps right in on the last shot and all sentimentality crumples into absurdity. Bravo!",1329868800,3,1221,4.903381642512077
8380772,3,B002TXB2YO,"First two stories are totally uninteresting, but the others have some funny moments. Of course, one should keep in mind that these are urban legends, some of the things portrayed are simply taken from jokes and anecdotes circulating at the time. As far as documenting life in Romania, it does as good a job as `Borat` did for Kazakhstan.",1296432000,,337,4.728813559322034
8380773,5,B002TXB2YO,"The movie is just excellent. The last fifteen years of communism were the first fifteen years of my life. Every little detail in the movie reminds me of my life in Romania during that period. And this is how we survived, by making fun of the situation, which the movie shows it so well. Romania is a different country now, but this movie will always remind me of my childhood. The streets, the houses, the shops, the people, etc., are all so real. I had the best laugh watching this movie.",1274659200,3,489,4.384615384615385
8380774,4,B002TXB2YO,"Following on from the remarkable and shocking 4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days, Cristian Mungiu uses here the format of the compendium movie to present other facets of life in the so-called ""Golden Age"" of Romania under the regime of Communist leader Ceausescu, where the reality for people on the ground was very different from the image being projected by Party officials. Tales from the Golden Age then presents five stories from the Ceausescu and immediate post-Ceausescu era, each of them standalone, all scripted by Mungiu but only one directed by him, each of them told in the form of ""urban legends"", since inevitably, if there was any truth to the stories at all, their failure to present the great Romanian Communist programme in any kind of a favourable light would certainly have seen their suppression from the press.

That makes the stories sound relentlessly grim, showing a oppressed populace living in fear of a corrupt and paranoid regime, but the approach in Tales from the Golden Age is in marked contrast to such bleak depictions in The Death Of Mr Lazarescu or indeed Mungui's own 4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days, presenting instead a more absurdly surreal view of living under a dictatorship intent on controlling every aspect of how people live and how their regime is represented in the more sedate and humorous style of 12:08 East Of Bucharest or California Dreamin'. Breaking this down into five separate short films of varying length, the impact achieved by the other longer and more serious depictions of life in Ceausescu's Romania is inevitably considerably diminished, but collectively they still present a fine sense of the issues faced by the Romanian people simply trying to live during this period. The shortages of food and even water and the rationing of basic essentials when balanced against the need to project an image of solidarity drive the people in these short films to extraordinary lengths to simply get by, and they inevitably sometimes commit stupid mistakes in the process or just stop caring. If the true menace that underlies and dictates their lifestyles is lessened by these blackly humorous urban legends, it nonetheless still feels like a more rounded and perhaps just as accurate portrayal of life as it was lived by most ordinary people in Romania during this time.

The film looks almost flawless on the UK DVD from Trinity, the image crisp, clear and colourful, the audio available in stereo and surround mixes, in Romanian with optional English subtitles. The extra features consist of a Trailer and another complete 18-minute episode cut from the film - The Legend of the Zealous Activist, dealing with an attempt by the Party to improve literacy in one small village. The quality here is of the same standard as the feature.",1273017600,3,2781,4.94017094017094
