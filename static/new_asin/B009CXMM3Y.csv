8539751,1,B009CXMM3Y,If I could give this no star I would.  Not at all easy to follow.  Tried it twice and have now trashed it.,1477353600,,106,3.5652173913043477
8539752,4,B009CXMM3Y,"It's a great workout if you follow the tutorials first before doing the workout. Nicole does the tutorial from the rear view as if you're taking a dance class with her. Even though she goes a little fast in the tutorial, you can always repeat the section again before doing the workout. In the workout, she covers the steps a little a time, repeating a few times before moving on. I agree that the lighting is dark in the video, but the tutorial section has enough lighting to learn the moves. Once you get the routine, you will definitely sweat! You can still sweat even if you get part of the routines because it's non-stop jumping around!",1451347200,,641,4.487179487179487

8539754,1,B009CXMM3Y,"I agree with the other post about this DVD.  The production quality is terrible, it is almost impossible to see what she is doing, the background is black, she is wearing black leggings and the lighting is extremely dark.  Beware!",1384732800,7,230,4.725
8539755,1,B009CXMM3Y,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The lighting is so VERY DARK! you cannot see the instructors feet or legs to see what she is doing. The instructor jumps around, lots of very bouncy moves similar to Tracey Anderson's style!  HATED IT!",1369440000,11,226,4.625
