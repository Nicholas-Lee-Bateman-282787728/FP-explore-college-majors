6878029,5,B00QRPZEA8,"Will Ferrell is hit or miss for me, but this one was a hit right out of the park.

I barely remember the Sid and Marty Krofft's shows; I have just enough knowledge of the show to recognize names of people and things, and to get the handful of ""inside"" jokes, but that doesn't even matter. The movie holds it's own and it's very entertaining.

I mean, you have to turn off your brain of course, it's not a movie steeped in science or philosophy, but it'll make you laugh.",1443657600,,470,4.211111111111111

8692531,3,B00QRPZEA8,"Where in the world is Matt Lauer? Actually Mat is the greatest actor in the film; Mat plays himself and adds credibility to the story.

Even though this film follows the general lost world formula it is unique and does not try to copy those films that have come before it. Dr. Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) has a parallel world theory that might supply us with the energy we need in this energy strapped world. This theory lands him a job as a La Brea Tar Pits science teacher. Enter cute freckle faced Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel) who shows proof that his theory is a reality. Together they venture in this world. Together they overcome great odds which include dinosaurs and skullduggery. Will they be able to return together?

The film is quite fun, tongue-in-cheek, and very handy; and watch where they place their handy's.
If you listen closely The Zarn (voice) is Leonard Nimoy from the movie ""Them!""

I only saw the Blu-Ray version so I cannot compare media. However this is not just another tachyon film.
There are some voiceover extras including a food diary.",1496102400,,1066,4.689839572192513
