7896048,4,6305826722,"It's a low budget B movie but it is worth the watch if you like alien movies and
have nothing better to watch.
I think with a bigger budget this would been a much better movie.",1409961600,,176,3.9166666666666665
7896049,5,6305826722,"A good low-budget film in my opinion, I'd been looking for this film for a while having seen it years ago.  Strange and quirky, it isn't what I'd call a classic film, but it is entertaining and the plot is understandable unlike a lot of cheap films.  For how low-budget it is with passable creatures and special effects considering the time it came out.  Worth buying at the low price it usually is at, trying to find it to watch online through any service is next to impossible, and it is well worth having a copy of for me at least.",1407801600,,534,4.267326732673268
7896050,5,6305826722,"Jason James Richter is great as a seventeen-year-old geek who has been, unbeknown to him, given special knowledge by one alien species on how to defeat a carnivorous alien race who is about to harvest the human population of planet Earth. (Two other people have also been given special knowledge.)
The plot seems more far fetched than the average alien invasion movie, but not only do they make it work, they keep it light and humorous even with enormous loss of human life.
Adding to the light humor the movie makes a few subtle hints of some scenes of older popular alien based movies.",1393286400,,587,4.653846153846154
7896051,1,6305826722,"I saw this movie in the $1 section and though ""what the heck."" Its ok if you like boring movies but its not worth your money. Even Mark Hamill didn't seem to interested in it. Can't say why its PG-13",1276560000,,199,4.0
7896052,1,6305826722,"I've seen B movies in my time, but this one doesn't even qualify to be in that category.  The only redeeming part of this movie is Mark Hamill's well delivered 20 minutes of acting.  Oh, and Melissa Galianos is kind of cute.  Full of cliche lines, sub par plots, and a cheesy ending, this movie is something you can mock for ages to come.",1211673600,,338,4.25
7896053,4,6305826722,"It is a dollar movie.  As someone else said, it is worth a dollar.  If you are buying this for Mark Hamill which is what attracted my son and I to it, then don't.  His part isn't too big.  The visual special effects are not bad considering.  The sound isn't bad most of the time, although some of the speaking scenes are home movie caliber sound.  There is not much depth of character.  It is a fun movie as long as you don't expect a blockbuster.",1182297600,,447,4.127906976744186
7896054,1,6305826722,"It's available at Walmart for $1.00 for a reason.  I admit, I bought it, I watched it.  At moments, I even liked it. It was worth $1.00.",1170633600,2,136,4.0
7896055,1,6305826722,"Okay, so the only reason we saw this is because 1)our mother picked it up and 2)my brother was sick in bed for weeks and we had rented everything else in the store.
It was so lame that it was, well... funny. No, not even. It just made your lip twitch that funny way when you're not sure what exactly you're looking at.
I'll admit its addictive. Its hard to turn away. You keep wondering where all the money and 'talent' went...(Did they save it for the end????)When you find out that it doesn't get any better, your lip reaches new hights and you wonder what else you could have done with that 90 minutes... (You could have written a better movie, filmed it with your dad's old camera with your kid sis playing all the different roles and had it on its way to Universal. Easy.)
Oh!!! and the music is just AMAZING!!!!! Who thought that you could recreate such diverse emotions and thoughts with only two cords??? Mwiiiiiang Mwoooooooong.... Oh, don't you just feel the tension, the romance, the TERROR!!!!
Now the sad part is that we saw this movie over 2 years ago and we only just found it here at Amazon.com. It's nowhere to be found near us (my brother thinks that Hollywood disowned it...I agree...). We've told all our friends about how terrible it was and they don't believe us. Now that we have found it they shall see!!
And they too will waste 90 minutes of their measily lives!",1013040000,6,1387,4.443137254901961
