8335658,1,B001QFYJUA,".I bought this DVD thinking, from the description, that it was about Apollo. I thought there would be stories, histories, a mini documentary. I also believed this as the description states there is a ""director"". This DVD is none of these things. It is in actuality, a glorified power point presentation set to polka music, and marching band music. I wanted to use it for a class I was teaching, but after watching endless images of coins with supposedly Apollo's face on them...(Apollo or Caesar?) march on I decided this was just a grand and costly mistake.",1261180800,9,558,4.762886597938144
