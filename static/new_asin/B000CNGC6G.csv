2466638,1,B000CNGC6G,The facts are not relevant to the ready solutions and the film is too old. The info is already well documented and known. It is so uninteresting.,1395705600,,145,4.407407407407407
2466639,1,B000CNGC6G,"Not recommended unless you lean the direction of the author.  Not fact based, does not offer solutions that are sustainable on a global scale.  See other one star ratings - these guys were spot on.",1393200000,,197,4.6
2466640,3,B000CNGC6G,"I wish it started out with more of a one two punch. This information is key for the general public to hear, loud and clear, upfront and personal. It's much like all the other food documentaties: FOOD, INC; CORN IS KING; etc. As a member of Weston A Price Foundation, I have this information in my bones. My challenge as a health care provider is helping the lay public appreciate the abdication of responsibility citizens have taken for the production, distribution, preparation of their food. Americans don't seem to care what it is, where it comes from, or how possible it is to support the body-mind-spirit with REAL FOOD.
As long as we do not recognize Energy Therapies with 3rd Party reimbursement; as long as we pay for down-stream medicine and discount the value-vital value-of Preventive Medicine/Lifestyle Medicine (upstream medicine), we will not have a healthy culture....What FED UP does do--like all the other Food Doc flicks--is to bring up front and personal, the idea that the industrial food industry and governments do NOT want healthy vibrant citizens.....It's bad for the bottom line/the stock holders returns/the longevity of the industries committed to making disease...Disease is BIG business. There is no profit in vibrant enthusiastic wellness.",1391385600,7,1269,5.195121951219512
2466641,2,B000CNGC6G,"I would love to hear some straight science on the effects of bio engineered food, and the only place that comes from in this film are those who are proponents of it.  That was the not the intent of the producer.  I went from being skeptical of the bio engineering to being far more secure about it.  This film bumbled on its attempt to demonize that science by posturing politically and emotionally, not objectively examining the facts.  Very poor. I added one star to the worst rating for the good info given by the very scientists they were trying to discredit!",1388102400,,563,4.544554455445544
2466642,4,B000CNGC6G,Another well done documentary proving that all it takes is money to lobby your government to get what you want.,1386892800,,111,4.6
2466643,4,B000CNGC6G,"Technique of interviewing small scale farmers and comparing their productivity value per acre to mono-crop massive corporate farming methods shows the cash advantages of small scale farms.  But the required work level is such that community group farms and similar programs often result in failure. Small farms, owner - operators work from a different incentive.  They seek profit, not just food savings.  But the larger issue is health.  Clearly the USA is burdened with massive health problems, most of which are food type related.  Growing numbers of obese people, diabetics, heart issues, etc. are increasingly being connected by careful research to food modifications.

Hyatt hotels (not mentioned in the film) recently asked guests of the hotel about food choices and, as a result, have changed some of their menu items to local source and healthy alternatives.  California Pizza Kitchens have carefully created viable gluten free products served within their existing pizza restaurants.

While these two events are not detailed in the film, they are in line with the goals of the film and show that progress is possible when citizens make their desires known to responsible corporate management.",1386374400,,1202,5.3563829787234045
2466644,4,B000CNGC6G,"I recently added this movie along with another 10+ movies (thanks to Prime) to do one (if not both), of two things. 1. Educate myself and change for the better, or 2. Just get another perspective. Well, this movie certainly did both for me.

Pros:
- there's a good sense of balance between the interviews, movie/ cartoon clips and b-role footage
- the information is short and sweet, to the point without any overload of big words with no explanations
- great interviews and footage on the science behind organic and modified food
- easy to comprehend discussions on organic vs. genetically modified, small scale farming/ farmers vs. agricultural corporations, economic vs. social dilemmas, science vs. nature...
- also includes footage of both the coroporations and those fighting against gm foods

Cons:
- there are 2 one on one interviews in particular that either have poor sound quality or the camera man didn't stop to think about the lighting effect of the sun
- I only give this 4 stars because I wish they would have included a one on one interview with a memeber from one of the corporations instead of just throwing in pre-recorded conferences, I think this would have helped in making the movie appear less bias
- also wish they would have gone more in depth as to how to help stop the major corps from continuing to modify foods, how to get the government agencies like the FDA, EPA and USDA to shut down these corps, ect...I guess I'll just have to research England, or just move there.

Overall this was a great movie and I highly recommend to others. I hope people realize that once their own demand for these unhealthy and unsafe foods stops, then the supply of something better will one day start, until then people it is unfortunate that they'll continue this bad habbit out of laziness, lack of education and modern day convenience.",1382659200,3,1852,4.727554179566564
2466645,3,B000CNGC6G,"It appears that Mos Def & Jack Black ""sweded"" this film...poor camera angles, bad light, often horrible audio discipline and interview backgrounds that were apparently stolen from a Sears Portrait Studio were unforunately pretty distracting - and I am no film critic.  The B-roll footage was good - if not great.  The message, that our current food system is unsustainable, came across reasonably well although its been done better by a more talented film crews.  Worth a watch if you have an hour or so to kill.",1372291200,2,512,4.862068965517241
2466646,5,B000CNGC6G,"Depends on your knowledge but most will find value in this movie if they care, this is a perspective, Amazon Prime free as well !!",1370476800,,130,4.24
2466647,5,B000CNGC6G,"I've seen a few documentaries of this type, this one was brief and should resonate well with all audiences.  Excellent balance between interview and video footage.  Good soundrack too.

There was excellent scientific discussion.  Covers the dangers of transgenic modification and genetic pollution, loss of biodiversity.

Also covers very well the contrast between harmful large agribusiness farming and sustatinable small scale farming.  It hits hard on the economic inequitability perpetrated on the thrid world farmer because of the investment and subsidization of chemical based and GMO based agriculture.

Some documentaries like to harp on immorality of science, and nefarious intent of big corporations, but this one simply shows the big business propaganda plainly for what it is.  It celebrates the preservation of traditional agriculture for the sake of safety, and makes a good case for the economic viability of organic local farming.",1365897600,13,946,5.612676056338028
8099572,5,B000CNGC6G,Its a great starting point for learning how collusion in the food and drug industry is harming our health.,1428364800,,106,4.631578947368421

8099574,2,B000CNGC6G,"Actually did not finish watching. While the subject matter was interesting and controversial, the movie failed to provide the material in an interesting manner throughout.  Bursts of interesting - mostly boring.",1402704000,,211,5.806451612903226
8099575,2,B000CNGC6G,"First let me say that I enjoy documentaries and health/nutrition documentaries in particular.  This film in particular didn't work for me though.  It attempted to be a little silly here and there to add some humor into the otherwise mundane presentation, but didn't hit the mark.  Let me save you some time and sum the plot up for you.. GMO's are bad.  You're welcome.",1401667200,,368,4.703125
8099576,3,B000CNGC6G,"The filmmakers must've wanted to keep things simple and clear with this documentary.
They probably could've covered a ton more stuff with a ton more detail, but then it would be a chore to watch.
Instead they get to the point on a few key issues.  Very important issues.  And they give all sides a chance to intelligently explain and defend what they do.
This is the kind of film that will make you want to plant your own vegetable garden and more frequently visit the farmer's market.",1401408000,,485,4.5
8099577,5,B000CNGC6G,"This is another FOOD Knowledge movie that really tells a story.
If you want to live better, live longer & stop being herded around
your dining table, watch these types of movies...
You are what you eat.  Eat well...  JJ",1401321600,,219,4.45
8099578,5,B000CNGC6G,this is slightly dated but still good info - Im sure things haven't improved much from the time of this documentary,1401148800,,115,4.523809523809524
8099579,2,B000CNGC6G,"This movie relies heavily on vintage news clips and television ads.  No material here that is really new.
I was unable to watch the entire film, giving up after about 25 minutes.",1400803200,,178,4.5625
8099580,4,B000CNGC6G,Very good explanation as to what has happened to our food over the last 20 years. There is no place to run and hide after you have seen this.,1400457600,,141,3.896551724137931
8099581,5,B000CNGC6G,this was very informative and presented in a very entertaining way.  Everything is explained well and in an easy to follow manner.,1398211200,,130,4.909090909090909
