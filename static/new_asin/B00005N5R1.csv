7946241,5,B00005N5R1,"If you love the British 'Carry On' film comedy series, then 'Cor, Blimey!' is a must. All the actors playing the roles of the original 'Carry On' actors are brilliant, and the storyline (which centers on the love affair between two of its biggest stars, Sid James and Barbara Windsor), if not sometimes correct, is wonderfully warming and very nostalgic. I watched it first on Youtube but had to get a copy of the original DVD (out of print now but you can still find copies on Amazon) simply because it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. If I could give it 6 Stars I would, brilliant!",1438819200,,607,4.428571428571429

7946243,4,B00005N5R1,"For anyone who loves the classic ""Carry On"" films, this drama of the behind-the-scenes activities of the making of the low-budget, low-denominator series of films is a delight.  All of the actors replicating the seemingly inimitable stars -- Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Barbara Windsor, Charles Hawtrey and Joan Sims -- are uncanny in their impersonations, and manage to transcend mere immitations to present pictures of the real people.  Adam Godley as Williams in particular is stunning, though everyone deserves bouquets. There are some factual errors, to be sure, but the film features witty dialogue to spare, and achieves genuine, moving drama by the end.  Comedy is not always pretty, and the people who are masters at creating comedy are not always spotless, and ""Cor Blimey!"" masterfully shows the hearts and souls and problems behind the people who strive to make us giggle.",1257724800,,888,5.23943661971831
7946244,3,B00005N5R1,"It is an enjoyable TV Movie, but for true die-hard CARRY ON fans there are major errors in the movie.  Bernard Bresslaw is depicted as playing Cardinal Wolsey in CARRY ON HENRY - whereas Terry Scott played him in the 1971 film.  Tony Hancock died in 1968 which was after Sid James' heart attack in 1967.  Others have reported errors in the 007 films being made at the time of certain Carry On's.
The performances were spot-on however, altho why Barbara Windsor was brought in to play her self in the latter part is a mystery (perhaps she wanted to ""get in on the act"" so to speak).",1058054400,,581,4.361111111111111
7946245,4,B00005N5R1,"Cor Blimey premiered on the ITV network on Monday 24 April, 2000. We were treated to something fantastic - Cor Blimey was, in a word, stunning.  I was familiar with the story, in general, having seen the original play and read the script.  I was also familiar with the uncanny portrayals of Sid, Babs and Kenny, courtesy of Geoffrey Hutchings, Adam Godley and Samantha Spiro.  Despite all that, from the opening theme, typical Carry On stuff courtesy of Barrington Pheloung, to the closing shots of Babs and Kenny (more on that later) Cor Blimey is a charming, funny and warm look at the lives of the people who continue to make us laugh 30 years later.",996105600,7,653,4.612068965517241
