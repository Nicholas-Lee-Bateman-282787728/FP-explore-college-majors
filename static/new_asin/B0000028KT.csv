7902169,5,B0000028KT,"Yes, one of the reasons I love this video is because I grew up with these songs. But my kids like it, too! They dance around the room to the dancing shoes song, and they enjoy all the other songs as well. I especially like that this video features Elmo when he was still cute and not so annoying.",1346803200,,296,4.033898305084746

7902172,5,B0000028KT,This DVD/video will bring back sesame street memories from your childhood!  Today's kids do not realize or care how 1970's it is.  They love it!  We would watch it in our daycare center a lot!  It has a lot of great songs.,1100390400,5,222,4.214285714285714
7902173,4,B0000028KT,"In a recent interview, Sonia Manzano (Maria) said she didn't realize until she was touring that many people in the US had never seen a Latino other than on Sesame Street.
As a half-Latin Midwesterner who grew up in the '70s, I can attest that this aspect of Sesame Street made a big difference in my life.  This video is all about this wonderful side of Sesame Street.
Herry Monster anchors a ""Monster Report"" about kids, which cuts to a series of song clips like ""Skin,"" ""Fixing My Hair,"" and ""Faces;""  and then bring things back around to show Gladys the Cow and Buster the Horse singing ""Different Yet the Same"" and rounds it all off with ""We All Sing With the Same Voice""  Terrific handling of a touchy subject.
My toddler loves this video, and I do, too - and it has Elmo in it for the diehards.  It's out of print - buy it if you can find it!",1045094400,4,848,4.248447204968944
