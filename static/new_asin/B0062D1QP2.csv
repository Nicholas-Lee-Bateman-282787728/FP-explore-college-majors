4932188,5,B0062D1QP2,"I write very few product reviews on Amazon, but this DVD deserves my full-throated recommendation.  Simply put, I could not have expected a more clear, knowledgeable and effective presentation on fasting.  Dr. Klaper brings to bear the full weight of his impressive clinical experience, medical expertise, research, and eloquence to this latest effort.  The result: a brilliant, cogent, informative, instructional, professional, and entertaining discussion on fasting by one of the leading experts on nutrition and health.  Anyone interested in this topic should watch this DVD.",1325116800,7,578,5.764705882352941
4932189,5,B0062D1QP2,"Not only did I find the information spot on and easy to understand, but the point that Dr Klaper makes about fasting not being to lose weight is very profound. Fasting is a medical concern and a way for the body to heal. Dr. Klaper makes that very clear. His step by step guidelines will walk a person right through their fast and let them know what to expect at each stage. He also speaks about what to put in your body both before and after the the fast, and that is what really separates this video about fasting from most others. As a nutritionist I will show this to anyone interested in fasting. This will be a great addition to my reference library and I will use it again and again with people. A great value and time saver!

4932190,5,B0062D1QP2,"I found this dvd by Dr. Klaper extremely useful.  The clear, detailed instruction of how to fast, who should fast, when to fast, etc. has all the information you need for conducting a fast at home or at a facility such as True North Health Center.  It is inspiring and powerful.  It made me want to do a fast again, having done a five day water fast several years ago at True North.  Fasting is one of the truly remarkable modalities for many health problems, as outlined in this dvd.  Dr. Klaper has such clarity in his presentation.  I would highly recommend this dvd for anyone considering doing a fast.  Amazing how the body can heal itself with nothing but water!",1324339200,18,668,4.471074380165289
4932191,5,B0062D1QP2,"The information in this DVD, and the manner it which it is conveyed is top notch.  It is readily apparent that Dr. Klaper has a vast amount of knowledge about and experience with the healing potential of fasting (and the human body in general), and he is able to organize and summarize all of that knowledge and experience into a clear, concise but comprehensive lecture, which is both enlightening and entertaining.  His use of a dynamic and well-organized powerpoint presentation, along with his easy-going and fluid speaking style, make this a very accessible and useful video for anyone interested in the topic.

Over the last year or so I've immersed myself in research regarding nutrition and related topics.  I've read a number of books and I've seen countless documentaries, instructional videos, speeches, and lectures, many of which are badly organized, at best, and downright incomprehensible, at worst.  This is one of the most accessible, best organized, and clearest presentations I've come across.  Of course, you have to be interested in fasting to get the full value of this DVD.  But even if you're not specifically and/or solely interested in fasting, this video contains revealing and surprising information about how the human body works (e.g., we use about 80% of our energy on a daily basis digesting our food).

As with other DVDs by Dr. Klaper (such as A Diet For All Reasons and Digestion Made Easy: A Journey Through Your Amazing Digestive System, both of which I continually refer to for guidance and to refresh my memory about various topics), this is a world-class lecture from a world-class doctor.",1324339200,22,1629,5.029739776951673
4932192,2,B0062D1QP2,"This DVD is a video of a presentation that the doctor gave on fasting.  It is less than an hour long.  The material is somewhat interesting, but absolutely not worth the price of this DVD.  This presentation is something that should be streamed for free from the doctor's web site.  You will watch this presentation once for your twenty four dollars and then not ever need to watch it again.  For half that amount of money you could buy a book on fasting, perhaps the one by Dr. Fuhrman or many others available, and you would receive orders of magnitude more information than is on this DVD.

Also, the making of this DVD is simply awful.  The DVD contains one continuous speech, but whoever produced the DVD really confuses everyone.  The first 2/3 of the speech is shown without ever getting to a menu on the DVD.  Then with no warning the remaining 1/3 of the speech is just truncated and you are thrown to the DVD menu.  From there, if you click the obvious button to play the DVD, you will be back at the beginning of the speech again and have to re-watch the first 2/3 that you already saw.  Instead, you have to go to the menu's Chapter selection item and figure out where the initial 2/3 of the speech ended so you can start again from there.  It is inconceivable to me why the DVD was made this way.",1323993600,20,1309,4.341563786008231

4932196,2,B0062D1QP2,"I was disappointed.  I was hoping for some more detailed information about fasting and how you feel and the problems you run into as you move through the 21 or 30 days.  The information provided was no more than Dr. Goldhamer gives you in his Youtube presentations.  In fact some of the information directly conflicts with Dr. Goldhamer's stuff.  And some of the information is actual wrong.  I mean, no one feels good by the 3rd or 4th day of the fast and certainly isn't ""energized"" because they just went into Ketosis.  Just ask anyone who has been on a low or zero carb diet.  it take a couple of weeks before the body and brain adapts to ketones.  I wouldn't recommend this DVD.  Stick with the Goldhamer presentations and save yourself some money.  Just for reference I'm writing this on my 11th day of a water fast which I'm doing on my own without supervision although I'm using a glucose meter and blood pressure cuff a couple of time a day.",1413072000,2,950,4.47093023255814

4932200,4,B0062D1QP2,"I thought it was very helpful, as I did a 7 day fast and I was prepared for what happened.  The only thing about the doctor's presentation was that it was geared toward native English speakers.  It would be helpful for those whose first language is not English to slow down a bit.  Even better would be to have the presentation in other languages, since I believe it would be helpful for those from other countries to learn as I did.",1397347200,3,433,4.320987654320987
4932201,5,B0062D1QP2,Excellent and very practical information. I learned a great deal on the little intricacies of fasting I was not aware of before. Highly recommended.,1362614400,3,148,5.208333333333333
4932202,4,B0062D1QP2,"I enjoyed Dr. Klaper's presentation about the methods, means, and effects of water fasting in this video. The information was well presented and clearly explains the benefits and the cautions to a water fast. If you're not familiar with the ""ins and outs"" of water fasting, this video is a good informative source, but you might find the information somewhat lacking if you're looking for a step by step method for completing a water fast.

Water Fasting, I have found, is an incredible way to restore balance and better health to the body, but it's not something to be taken lightly. Unless you are already fairly healthy, one should always complete a water fast under the skilled care of a Naturopath or MD who has a familiarity with whole body detox.

The video is basically a recording a live Powerpoint Presentation given by Dr. Klaper. To be honest, I usually find these types of presentations rather dull, but this video, about 50 minutes in length, held my attention as Dr. Klaper moved the information along a good pace.

Great introduction to the benefits of Water Fasting, but for those already familiar with this type of cleansing, there probably is little new information for you.",1361404800,9,1193,4.838235294117647

8491114,5,B0062D1QP2,If you are considering or even thinking about Fasting you need to watch this. Even if you want to juice fast this video is for you.

8491116,5,B0062D1QP2,"Dr. Michael Klaper is an MD Internist who works with his colleagues Dr. Allen Goldhamer and Dr. Doug Lyle.  Together they have successfully helped HEAL well over 20,000 patients through either juice fasting or predominantly water fasting. Health issues that respond well to long term (no longer than 40-days or less) water fasting is hypertension and diabetes. There are many others, but those are top two.

At the end of the fast, most patients no longer need chronic prescription medications that control disease, but fasting truly heals diseases.

In this DVD, Dr. Klapper explains how fasting works in the human body. Explains most of the pitfalls, and challenges of successfully getting a positive outcome from a long term water fast.  What is not covered is the refeeding process when you come out of the fast.

The first 2-3 days are the most difficult if you are eating the standard American processed food diet, but after the three days, you then enter ketosis. Ketosis is a state where the body transitions from burning glucose to burning fat. As long as you stay in ketosis, and there are no side effects, the fast is very easy. Most use Bayer Ketosis Sticks to measure your ketosis from your urine. When the ketones are large, things are good, but when it wains down to moderate or small, its time to start the refeeding process.

The refeeding process is juice for a few days, then soft fruits and juice, then soft steamed veggies, then rice and lentils is when you come out of the refeeding process.  This refeeding process is the trickiest part of the fasting process.  You need a physician to monitor you through out the process, but I personally believe you need it more so in the refeeding process.

If you want to reverse dietary disease and invigorate your youthful vitality, the first step is to watch this video.  I have seen many videos on youtube and viemo on water fasting and this presenation is by fart the most thorough presentation.",1491091200,3,1961,4.775147928994083

8491119,5,B0062D1QP2,"Yes, this doctor is for real and what he has to say about diet and fasting is well worth learning. Follow this with a few books by Dr. McDougall, Dr. Esselstyn and T. Colin Campbell and you will have all the knowledge you need to stay healthy in an unhealthy world. Do it for yourself, your loved ones and especially the Earth.
