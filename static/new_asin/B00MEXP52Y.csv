6575846,5,B00MEXP52Y,"We are huge Peppa Pig fans in my house so we were excited to watch Peppa's Christmas! Yes, I said WE because I love those piggies too!

At first watch, I'll admit I was not a fan. I thought the pigs were so weird and kind of annoying! But my kids were instantly infatuated. At first I just appreciated the fact that it was a show I could put on and count on my kids to be so into, they would let me get some work done! But as time went on, I'd hear it running in the background and find myself starting to laugh. Needless to say, Peppa Pig and family grew on me and now I consider myself a fan.

The show is so witty and funny. Sure the snorts and other bodily functions can be a bit annoying but it's all in good fun.

The Christmas DVD is just what my kiddos needed to get them into the holiday spirit now that Halloween is behind us and Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming! Just look at the cover of the Dvd; who wouldn't love a little Peppa Christmas cheer?

This DVD has 12 episodes and just one is a Christmas episode. My kids always get confused by this when they see the cover. They think it's a Christmas movie or all Christmas episodes. They still love them all; just wish they were all Christmas themed. So of course the Christmas one was their favorite!

I liked the Christmas one as well and that the Santa was like the classic Santa you'd expect but with Peppa Pig style!

Peppa Pig: Peppa's Christmas DVD was fun for my kiddos to watch, especially the Christmas episode! We love Peppa and can always count on her and family for good laughs!",1415059200,2,1557,4.190635451505017

6575856,2,B00MEXP52Y,"Being called ""Peppa's Christmas"", I was expecting a disk full of episodes about the holidays and at least winter.

It was very disappointing for him. They still watch it but when the cover reads that it's Peppa's Christmas the episodes should at least all deal with winter activities.
The episodes are:
Peppa Christmas
Pirate island
Cuckoo clock
Pretend friend
The long grass
The Dentist
Zoe Zebra
Nature Trail
Pen pal
School bus trip
Granny and grandpa's attic
The school fete

I own the other repeats, so why would I pay twice for one short? THIS IS A CASH GRAB! Hate when companies misuse the consumer and treat us poorly, we deserve above all things, honesty.

6576069,4,B00MEXP52Y,"I bought this for my 3 yr. old grandson, who loves Peppa Pig.  I guess I must not have read other reviews because I thought this was an all new, Christmas only, movie.  I was so disappointed to find that it is a number of separate episodes, only one of which is a new Christmas episode (at least I THINK it's new). I know my grandson will love it regardless, but it's a shame that only a small portion of it is actually new, while all the other episodes I believe have already been shown on TV and he's probably seen them already many times.  Goes to show....always read carefully so you know what you're actually getting.",1416009600,6,622,4.299145299145299

6576072,3,B00MEXP52Y,I purchased this for my grandson who is a big gan of Peppa Pig.  Very disappointing.  The title show Peppa's Christmas was new and he enjoyed it very much.  The rest of DVD were episodes that have been shown multiple times on TV.  Quite a rip off for one new episode!,1415577600,28,267,4.176470588235294
