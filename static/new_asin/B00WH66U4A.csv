7132268,4,B00WH66U4A,"The set provided everything from art postcards to character description etc., but the feels of this movie(OVA) that it was cut short... Not spoiling anything but it could have been longer, In other words it was a good ending. ---A nice addition from the last 8 movies(OVAs)---",1433721600,2,276,4.8936170212765955
7132269,5,B00WH66U4A,"Love it!! ""Paradox Paradigm"" is exceptional!! The whole saga is a bit like ""Memento"" in terms of time discontium, each episode is like a forever-unfinished puzzle that provoke you to watch the next one without knowing what time point you will be at. Need to pay a lot of attention and try not to skip forward (very tempting for most of the time), or else, you don't know what you have missed. The English subtitles add another layer of complication for comprehension.",1522972800,,467,4.7073170731707314
7132270,5,B00WH66U4A,"Love it! It's pretty exceptional, to be honest. I recommend any anime fan watch this.",1522800000,,85,4.733333333333333
7132271,5,B00WH66U4A,"Another Type-Moon classic, absolutely a visually stunning series of movies and great themes in each one.",1522540800,,104,5.5625
7132272,4,B00WH66U4A,"This is one of those shows that do not follow a chronological sequence in its episodes, being a psychological thriller type love story I think it works. It examines different types of mental disorders and gives it a supernatural quality, it is hard to look away. I literally binge watched this straight through the night and into the next day. I'd recommend it to a friend but maybe keep it PG 13 because gore and adult themes.",1522195200,,427,4.558441558441558
7132273,5,B00WH66U4A,"Ill try to keep my review brief. This series is visually gorgeous and the soundtrack far superior to anything I've ever heard from other Japanese animation. I kid you not, even if you don't understand the plot, the sheer level of graphic detail and beautiful sound will make it hard to look away. Despite how beautiful this series is, it may not be right for you if you are easily confused, don't do well with blood and gore, or aren't looking for something that is dark and gritty. Plot wise, you may find yourself lost on your first time through this movie series, as it is not in chronological order. Still this series is a must watch for anyone that likes a deep, dark, and mysterious story.",1521936000,,695,4.480314960629921
7132274,5,B00WH66U4A,"Dark, visually stunning, heart felt.  And complicated -- psychologically.  Featuring a deeply damaged female lead character.  The episodes are not in order but they do add information in a logical way.  An excellent and unusual anime. Really fantastic.",1520726400,,252,5.552631578947368
7132275,5,B00WH66U4A,"Beautiful. Under-rated. Age really well compared to other TYPE-MOON anime. It's slow and dialog heavy, but the soundtrack and visuals just draw you in.",1519344000,,151,5.333333333333333
7132276,5,B00WH66U4A,Was one of the most interesting while confusing set of movies I would say. The animation is spectacular with the twists in story keeping you interested.,1519084800,,152,4.884615384615385
7132277,5,B00WH66U4A,It is wonderful,1518998400,,15,4.333333333333333
7132278,5,B00WH66U4A,I wish I knew earlier that Amazon Prime added this and fate/stay night.,1518652800,,71,4.538461538461538
7132279,5,B00WH66U4A,As a Big Fan of Type-Moon and the Nasuverse I had to eventually check this highly acclaimed series out and I'm so glad I did. The animation was great the soundtrack was great the story was great the characters as well. The list goes on and I am happy to recommend this series to anyone who wants to watch a trilling and captivating journey.,1518134400,,340,4.328125
7132280,5,B00WH66U4A,"OMG, one of the most epic animes now in Amazon Prime video",1517097600,,58,3.9166666666666665
7132281,5,B00WH66U4A,I was so happy to see this added to prime! It has a gripping plot to go along with its unreal animation. Highly recommend.,1516492800,,122,4.125
7132282,5,B00WH66U4A,"Great series of movies.  Taken independently, not all of the movies stand up well alone, and obviously some are better than others.  Though as a whole, the movies piece together the story of Shiki Rygi and Mikiya Kokut, and make up a very good love story, mystery,, and supernatural thriller. Fantastic artwork, action, and animation, and an also fantastic soundtrack that really sets the mood throughout the movies. Highly recommended as a showcase for the medium. A classic.",1515888000,7,476,5.089743589743589
7132283,2,B00WH66U4A,"I enjoyed watching the Fate series and the Tsukihime, and this series is surprisingly different. Its pacing is way too slow for my taste. I wouldn't recommend this series unless you enjoy watching nothing happen for long periods of time.

It's artistic and has decent visuals, but I can't stand the lack of plot development.",1515283200,,324,4.890909090909091
7132284,5,B00WH66U4A,"Jaw-droppingly gorgeous animation, a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and a complexity of material that will enable you to find or learn something new every time you watch it. This movie series by Type-MOON is one of the founding pieces of their conceptual universe and introduces many ideas that would be adapted in their later works, like Tsuikihime and the oft-adapted Fate/Stay Night.
This is an absolute must-see for anyone who enjoys quality anime.",1515110400,3,454,5.319444444444445
7132285,5,B00WH66U4A,One of my favorite series. ufotable did an amazing job with the music and use of color. The series is very adult though so please keep that in mind.,1515024000,,148,4.137931034482759
7132286,5,B00WH66U4A,"This is really good anime. The animation is visually stunning, the plots are complex as are the characters. The story lines are intense. Do yourself a favor and spend some time with this one, it's worth it.",1513382400,7,206,4.594594594594595
7132287,5,B00WH66U4A,best of the best,1510358400,,16,3.25
7132288,5,B00WH66U4A,Being a fan of the Fate series is what brought my attention to this anime. I hope this channel continues to deliver more quality anime.,1509494400,7,135,4.44
7132289,5,B00WH66U4A,"Watched these a few years ago, and now I can rewatch them in a much more legal way!!!!! So good!!",1508025600,,97,3.9
7132290,5,B00WH66U4A,"The post-credit scenes are not subtitled at all, which makes no sense as Amazon bothered to subtitle the ending theme songs. There's also the fact that some post-credit scenes are important for connecting the dots between each episodes. Even if some of them are not, the post-credit scenes are part of episode just as much as the main content. It would be appreciated if the translation/subtitle team could work on that and actually complete the subtitle for each episode in its entirety. Until then, I will be leaving a 1 star review.

Edit: Just finished watching again and aside from few nitpicks about certain translations throughout the series, Amazon did great bringing this movie series available for streaming. For first-time watchers, the brief synopsis/overview by Amazon basically explains what this series is about. What I want to add on to that description is that this series is one of the earliest works by Kinoko Nasu, who is also the author of Fate/stay night and supervisor of other various Fate series. As such, this show introduces some of the most fundamental concepts in Nasuverse, including souls, the Root (Radix in this sub), Counter Force (Deterrent Force in this sub), Magic and Magecraft, and Origin.

For people who loved Fate series, I definitely recommend watching this fantastic series. While you may get thrown off by how this show delivers its narrative, if you can give your undivided attention while watching, all the pieces of the story will start clicking and come together. Even if you've never watched or liked Fate series, I still highly recommend this series as it does have a much different narrative and atmosphere than Fate animes, especially if you are into supernatural/mystery/thriller genre.",1506297600,9,1740,5.101754385964912
7132291,5,B00WH66U4A,"An incredible tonal piece, especially the first movie, with ontological questions and an off-kilter atmosphere underlying the entirety of the plot. The soundtrack must also be mentioned because it's undoubtedly fantastic.",1505952000,2,221,6.161290322580645
7132292,5,B00WH66U4A,Wow I'm so happy to finally see this up somewhere!,1505606400,2,50,4.1
7132293,5,B00WH66U4A,Do yourself a favor and watch this if you're a fan of Type-Moon and Ufotable. Kara no Kyoukai is where Kinoko Nasu got his career started as a writer that lead him to writing Tsukihime and Fate/stay night. Ufotable's adaptation of it put them on the radar and lead to them adapting Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. Kara no Kyoukai is incredible.,1505347200,11,366,4.734375
7132294,5,B00WH66U4A,This is my favorite anime. It touched me so deeply.,1505260800,4,51,4.2

7132296,5,B00WH66U4A,I love this. All the extra stuff is so gorgeous to look at. The original series was amazing so I can't wait to see what this has in store for me.,1483574400,,145,3.7096774193548385

7132298,5,B00WH66U4A,Grabbed this as an early Birthday/Christmas present for my Fiance. Great movie series. Product got here surprisingly fast as well.,1446940800,,130,5.55
8713400,5,B00WH66U4A,It is awesome. Period. Go watch it.,1535068800,,35,4.142857142857143
8713401,5,B00WH66U4A,"One review called this a disjointed mess. Disjointed yes, but if you can get your head around the non-linear plot it's well worth the watch.",1533340800,,140,4.64
8713402,5,B00WH66U4A,"Kara No Kyoukai (the Garden of Sinners) has a stellar reputation in the anime community. Being born from the Nasuverse, on the most popular series of books, anime, and games in Japan, this series is one of the top recommendations in the community. Given that the series is incredibly expensive to buy on DVD, I was stunned to find it for streaming on Amazon. But I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth.

Garden of Sinners is a series of 10 movies. The first movie is told anachronically, dropping you into the action without fulling explaining what's going on, and I love it that way. Still it wouldn't a proper review if I didn't reveal some things, so tread lightly. Our lead character is Shiki Ryougi, who works at a paranormal detective agency of sorts. Armed with a Tanto knife and a few supernatural gifts, she investigates a series of tragedies in her city over the course of four years. Let's not mince words, this is a dark series, covering everything from rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and everything in between. But if that doesn't turn you off, you won't be able to find much better.

The best thing about this series? The animation, even 10 years later, is still bar none the best ever produced. No one can top Ufotable. The series also bring a unique magic system that is explained piecemeal across the many movies, and a group of character very reminiscent of the gritty 90's action star roles, but with some unique twists. The only flaw were the few dud entries; notably movies 6 and 8, which don't measure up to the rest.",1531353600,,1541,4.579710144927536
8713403,5,B00WH66U4A,"This series was almost as good, and as deep, as the Monogatari series. Great animation and a fabulous story. I was glued to the screen every moment.",1526860800,,148,4.518518518518518
8713404,5,B00WH66U4A,"This is a such a refreshing anime, it gives action & romance directed for a more mature audience, It is brutal, bloody & gruesome, but only in brief moments. The gore contrasts sharply with the subtly and sweetness of the romance between the two main characters.

I also really appreciate the non-linear story-telling.",1525996800,,318,5.0
8713405,5,B00WH66U4A,crazy ass show,1525910400,,14,4.0
8713406,5,B00WH66U4A,"Most anime is kind of dumb, in one way or another. It's genre entertainment for a mass medium, TV, so that's to be expected. Also, lots of it has low production values.

This long series is the absolute opposite of both those kinds of anime. The visuals are routinely stunning, the story is complex, internally consistent, and above all conveys the sense of mystery that is one of the most important elements in fantasy. Further, the characters seem real, and their experiences and feelings are often very moving.

I'm thrilled to have found this.",1524268800,,547,4.808510638297872
8713407,2,B00WH66U4A,Most films try to avoid disjointed storylines or continuities.  These guys probably tried to embrace disjointedness to enhance the feeling of paranormal effect and losing ones mind.  But they went overboard and it just was just a jumbled mess.  And its a real shame because everything else was top notch.  Special credit goes to the awesome soundtrack which alone made it worth watching.  And the soundtrack is in 5.1 channels of Dolby surround.  Even Disneys The Last Jedi couldn't afford to do that.,1523923200,,501,4.975903614457831
8713408,5,B00WH66U4A,"My favorite episode which is more like a movie is Paradox Paradigm. I love this series, I wish I would have known about it sooner. The final episodes leave much to be desired in this alternate universe, but this anime series has a special place in my heart.",1523923200,,257,4.375
8713409,2,B00WH66U4A,"Impressive artwork, intriguing music, strong images, and lots of action.  One thing is missing, however.  It doesn't actually go anywhere.",1523318400,,138,5.85
