The products came in even before the expected arrival date. I appreciate everything he has done because it is not easy finding Filipino dvds/movies in my area.

In this volume, Chichay and Joaquin find out they are the childhood friends from their time in the carnival...strengthening their bond even further. Joaquin also finds out all the devious activities his mom has done to make Chichay's life miserable. That won't stop his mother from separating the sweethearts. Will she be successfully in separating them for life?",1405728000,,685,5.171171171171171
