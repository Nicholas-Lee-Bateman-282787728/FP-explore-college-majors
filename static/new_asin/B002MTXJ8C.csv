Life Partner is a rehash and updated version of countless movies that you have seen in the past. It is mainly about two couples and a lawyer. The first couple is Fardeen Khan and Genelia Dsouza who are madly in love but Fardeen is not sure about his fiance personality or if she is capable for being a suitable wife. Bhavesh played by Tushar Kapoor has never dated and is saving himself for his wife, who is Prachi Desai. Finally there is Govinda who does not believe in marriage and always tries to divorce couples as he is a divorce lawyer. The rest of the movie follows their twists and turns. All lead actors are strictly okay. Genelia Dsouza may be pretty in certain scenes but she has the most irritating voice and I found her character irritable. Govinda hankering on a comeback trail acts in a professional manner but needs a fashion makeover. In my opinion Tushar Kappor and Prachi Desai along with Vikram Gokahle delivered the most in this movie, especially because they have several difficult scenes. Strictly ok and do not expect much. I give it three stars. 01/02/10",1262476800,,1092,4.634020618556701

Genelia is really excellent at playing characters who are young, vibrant, and impudent, even though I read somewhere that she's actually getting a little fed up with these roles. That's too bad, because it's her sassy, irreverent attitude - such a change from the more traditional behaviors exhibited by other actresses in Hindi films - which draws me into watching her onscreen.

It makes sense that Genelia does better whenever she's the only featured lead actress. Focus is on her more, she gets to display her talents more. In LIFE PARTNER,  however, she not only shares the lead actress billing, but she's caught up in an ensemble cast. And when one of the co-stars is the ridiculously over-the-top Govinda, well, it's a losing cause. Genelia D'Souza has been in several very entertaining pictures. LIFE PARTNER isn't one of them. I found myself struggling with this movie early on; I soldiered on, but sort of resentfully.

The plot revolves around the institution of marriage, a common theme in Indian cinema. LIFE PARTNER features three NRIs living in Cape Town, South Africa. Karan, Bhavesh, and Jeet are three friends whose respective perspectives on marriage clash like a mother. The fun-loving and adventurous Karan (Fardeen Khan) believes in marrying the one you're in love with. He dotes on his girlfriend of four years, Sanjana or ""Sanju"" (Genelia), never mind that Sanju explores a new career move every six months or so, and that her new career choice is always something she really sucks at. But Karan loves her anyway. For him and Sanju, the romance still feels fresh and new.

Bhavesh (Tusshar Kapoor) is a straight-up nerd, clueless and awkward and he's fervently saving himself for marriage. He espouses the traditional arranged marriage, and he hopes his marriage will be arranged soon because he's been taking notes on romance from Karan and he's dying to test them out. Bhavesh's family is originally from Gujarat, and Bhavesh expects to get hitched to a backwoods Gujarati girl. His wife does end up being from Gujarat, but Prachi (Prachi Desai) also happens to be beautiful, highly intelligent, sophisticated, and independent. Uh-oh.

And then there's the third guy Jeet Oberoi (Govinda) and he's got no use at all for marriage. Not too surprisingly, Jeet is a divorce lawyer who tends to mess around with his female clientele.

The first half of the film reaches for a playful, lighthearted tone as it explores Karan and Sanju's tumultuous relationship and also features Bhavesh's very quick, clumsy courtship of Prachi. It's all fun and giggles, although I will say that I wasn't expecting the twist right before intermission. And then the second half rolls around and things get serious.

Marriage can be a bummer, this movie demonstrates. Karan tries to keep up with his wife's extravagant lifestyle, but pampering the flighty Sanju soon takes its toll on his career and eventually on his marriage. Ghavesh, meek dude that he is, finds himself caught in the middle. His accomplished wife Prachi, from an affluent family but raised by an indulgent father, feels stifled by the rigid, old-fashioned standards set by Ghavesh's ultra-conservative father. And Ghavesh is such a weak lily that he's unable to stand up for his wife.

Marital disputes, the importance of family, the modern couple versus the traditional couple. These are themes which crop up often in Hindi films, and they're often dealt with in heavy-handed manner. Disappointingly, that's the case with LIFE PARTNER. The last half hour really falls apart in terms of how everything was so conveniently wrapped up and of how preachy it all got.

I yawned thru the songs, although it was fun watching Sanju not being able to get the hang of the steps during one particular dance number. And, to segue horribly, Amrita Rao is beautiful and sexy and her cameo appearance is wasted.

I haven't seen any of Govinda's older movies, which apparently was when he was at his best. I've only seen him in his more recent works, and I'm not a fan. But Govinda, still packing those extra pounds, does turn in a gleeful performance, and never mind that I had a hard time buying his chubby divorce lawyer being this irresistible womanizer. Prachi Desai is really good with the more serious female lead, whereas Genelia's spoiled brat routine aims for laughs. As a fan of Genelia, I'm a little disappointed with the lack of depth in her character. It's MASTI all over again. Still, I got a big laugh when Karan, fresh from work, comes home to a delightful romantic dinner, only to learn that Sanju had hired a maid to cook the romantic dinner. Sanju had also hired an assistant maid to the maid. C'mon, that's a little funny...",1258416000,,5289,5.226415094339623
