8200581,4,B000RGU5SE,"This is a collection of all six Best Picture Oscar winners produced by Fox Studios that currently have a DVD release. This is the highest priced of three similar collections. The other two collections are:

Studio Classics Best Picture Collection
Contents: Sunrise, All About Eve, Gentlemen's Agreement, How Green Was My Valley
Advantage: This is the only way to get Sunrise, which won best Artistic Film of 1927-1928, but was strictly not a Best Picture Oscar winner. Wings won that award that year. Also, this collection has the Studio Classics version of All About Eve, not the older version with less extras that is in this bundle of six films. Finally, the price for the four films is only between twenty and thirty dollars, depending on when, where, and how you buy it.
Disadvantage: Does not contain the newer films in the six film bundle.

20th Century Fox Best Picture Collection - This is a newer set that is set to be released in early 2008.
Contents: All About Eve, Gentlemen's Agreement, How Green Was My Valley, The Sound of Music, The French Connection
Advantage: A lower cost of between thirty and forty dollars depending on where, how, and when you buy it.
Disadvantage: It is described as only having five discs. Thus you are not getting the double disc edition of Sound of Music that you get in the six film bundle.

This collection's main advantage is that you are getting the best available versions of four of the six films. The only exceptions are All About Eve and The French Connection. The copy of All About Eve in this collection predates the high quality Studio Classics edition which has commentary and other extras. The copy of the French Connection you are getting is the single disc edition versus the double disc edition which is currently available.

As for the quality of the films themselves, I'd say that only The French Connection has aged badly. Gentlemen's Agreement also has some issues with being somewhat dated, but for some reason films made in the 40's just seem to age better than those made in the 70's. This is probably just because I can actually remember the 1970's.",1194048000,6,2116,4.7574931880108995
