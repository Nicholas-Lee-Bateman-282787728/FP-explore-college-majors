8433884,2,B004L5QXLU,"I was a Marine on this operation, in one of the helicopter squadrons shown in the movie.  Even I got sick of seeing similar views of takeoffs and landings.  My detachment of four UH-1E's from VMO-3 which you could occassionally see on the bow if the Iwo Jima, provided fire support for the CH-46 and US-34D transports landing troops in the Mekong Delta.  The film contains virtually no live combat footage, other than a few wounded being transported.

I was there when Westmoreland came on board.  No one gave a big rats ass.

Don't waste your money.
