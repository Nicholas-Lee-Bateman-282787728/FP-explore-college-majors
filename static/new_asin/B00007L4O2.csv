7977809,5,B00007L4O2,"I first saw this show on a preview on another anime DVD my friend bought.  Right away we both knew that Excel Saga was something special.  Just watching the preview made us laugh.  While browsing through a store just about a week ago I found Excel Saga volume 5 just sitting there so I decided to pick it up and check it out.  I was expecting a lot of humor, but this thing just blew me away.  I jumped right into it without even watching the previous volumes.  That's because theres absolutly no story line to follow?  Sound strange?  Well that's exactly what Excel Saga aims to do.  The only story line that is there they explain throughout the DVD.
Every episode usually begins with the Writers trying to come up with new ideas for the show, which usually results in them double crossing the author of the original manga, Koshi Rikdo.  This was the first interesting thin I noticed in the show.  The writers and author actually put themselves in the show, which results in great humor, especially whenever the afro-bearing Nabeshine appears on screen.
The two main characters, Excel, a hyperactive young lady who seems to be in love with their groups leader, and Hatchan,a ""Kenny"" from South Park type of character who always appears to die for no reason, even though she is a beautiful girl.  They both work for the group ACROSS under the almighty Illpallazzo, another extremely funny character, whose ultimate goal is to take over the city for some reason.
Another character that I fell in love with is Pedro who dies in a fire and turns into a ghost, which leads him into a story that makes no sense at all, and every time he screams ""No!"" it brings a smile to my face.
Another interesting thing is that the characters actually know they are just playing roles in this so called wretched story.  It's always humorous to hear the characters refer to the writers as idiots, or some other form of the word.
The DVD contains fours episodes of non-stop humor.  The first episode, episode 18 out of 26, is a huge spoof of The Power Rangers, and they do a great job of it.  I don't remember the Power Rangers going around and blowing up people with guns though.
Episode 19 is the only snag in this wonderful DVD.  It just doesn't have as much humor as the rest do, mainly because the whole episode follows the ""soon-to-be-food"" dog Menchi, as he travels around the world with a girl for some reason.  The show is just way to serious here, and there's not enough of Excel and Hatchan here.
Episode 20 begins with the writers not having any idea of what to do with this episode.  The soon decide that instead of worrying about it they'll just make another flash back episode dedicated to Pedro, and forge Rikdo's signature on the paper.  Excel and Hatchan host the show in a ""PUke Bar"" with the bartender popping in the tapes into the VCR, as Excel make a rather interesting host, while Hatchan sits at her side, spitting blood out of her mouth.
The entire episode takes a look back at the episodes before with Pedro, which was good because I really didn't understand his story, that is until I realized his story didn't make sense anyway.  I never know a flash back episode could be so good.
The real treat of this episode is at the end when the bar tender reveals he has the continuation of Pedro the Movie, which ultimatly adds on the insanity.
Finally is Episode 21 which is the best, as Illpallazzo reveals that ACROSS HQ is making changes via a messenger.  The messenger, Key, shows up hours late, and begins hitting on Excel, which is when we get a very humorous look inside the mind of Illpallazzo.
Key trys to relay the message via a rock song, which again leads to a lot of humor, as Key says he cannot sing under the unsatisfactory conditions.  Basically the whole episode is about Excel and Hatchan taking Key around with them, waiting until he can sing again.
The English voice over are superb, and couldn't be any better.  Especially Excel, whose hyperactive way of speaking can be hard to understand at times.  The original Japanese voice overs are all here, along with the english subtitles.  Plus a cool little feature where every now and then a Menchi bubble appears to explain a joke, or a fact with you.  Use this when listening to the Japanese voices to understand what's going on since the Japanese use a lot of puns and such as humor.
The thing I really love about Excel Saga is that you fall in love with every character you see.  Unlike some other anime I've seen, every character has his or her own personality, and you love them for that.  The each have a different style of making you laugh.  Plus they don't all get along so it makes things fun.
All in all I love this DVD, it's a must have for any anime fan, or anyone who just wants a bunch of good laughs.  You'll watch this thing many times and laugh every time you do.  It would be a horrible idea to live with out this DVD.",1055980800,3,4905,4.4591265397536395
7977810,3,B00007L4O2,"Admittedly, volume 5 was a little dissappointing but the humor is an improvement from DVD 4.
Episode 18 is a deranged Power Rangers parody where Watanabe and the rest of the Civil Security crew run around the city wreaking havoc on unsuspecting petty criminals. Most memorable quote: ""Double Giga Paper Fan!"" ~ Sumiyoshi.
Episode 19, Menchi's Great Adventure 2 parodies Around the World in 80 Days featuring an heiress whose past entwines with Wolf's from episode 10. Also an assassin that looks suspiciously like Daisuke Jigen from Lupin III and a Dragonball parody. Most memorable quote: Pedro: Afro no!!! Nabeshin: What? You hate the afro?! Pedro: Si, Pedro hate.
Episode 20, The Best of Pedro where we recap Pedro's sordid story so far and then see the fight between Pedro and That Man. Most memorable quote: ""The messenger of love and justice Excel Mask. Works 24-7, no promotions! Lots of hair growing in my ears. Come if you dare, envoy of evil! Or rather, Sir, that's the last train."" ~ Excel
Episode 21, a rock anime parody!! Jabs at Visual-Type Japanese bands, some yaoi, a jealous Il Palazzo, and incredibly risque humor. Most memorable quote: too long to put here but it's the song Key sings to Il Palazzo.
Through the entire thing I was still left with a question: What happened to the puchuus???",1048982400,,1309,4.822222222222222
7977811,4,B00007L4O2,"I'd have to say I was happy to finally get this when I collected the other 4 volumes.  It has four episodes, but I find two out of it which I like.  There was the episode about Daitenzin, and the civil servants were involuntarily dressed in latex bubblegum crisis looking uniforms.  It was hilarious to watch them beat [up] people committing everyday no-no's.  Sumiyoshi in the uniform was disturbing.
  The next episode was part two of Menchi's great adventure.  She meets a rich girl and travels the world.  It's shocking to find the appearence of a character back in the picture trying to cause them havoc.  Then the movie showing Pedro's bad luck all over again has the good stuff at the end.  The Dragon Ball parody was funny, but I really thought the episode was annoying and why the produces wasted time on it.  My favorite was the rock anime episode.  Key is a sexy rocker and has to deliver a message to Ilpalazzo from AcROSS HQ.  Though, he can't sing in the conditon till later in the end.  There is yaoi in Excel's fantasy.  Warning is when Key is behind the curtain and playing with his guitar.  Excel's wild imagination cracked my sister and mother up.
  I'm disapointed how little and tiring it was to watch it.  Go to the EXTRAS and read the article on the disappearance of a dead girl, aka Hyatt.",1047081600,,1313,4.487288135593221
7977812,5,B00007L4O2,"I'll keep this short and sweet... I loved this volume of Excel Saga, just as I loved all of the others!  Volume four was a little below par, but oh well, this isn't volume four, this is volume five and Excel and her Saga are back with all the wackiness still in tact!  Buy this now or may Puchuus eat your souls!",1046822400,,312,4.016129032258065
7977813,3,B00007L4O2,"Humor doesn't always follow from one person to another, and get even trickier when translation is involved. As such I'm still able to give this disk 3 stars. (1-3 = 5 star, 4 = 4 star)
I found these episodes painful to watch. Maybe if it wasn't another review episode (focusing on Pedro) its just too soon. The other episodes left me going ""Why am I watching this?"" Maybe it was a great Power Rangers spoof, but I haven't watched that series.
I can't quite say it right, but basically all the 'humor' in this disk missed me. Here'd to hoping the extras are good.",1046563200,,562,4.3619047619047615
7977814,5,B00007L4O2,"With volume 5, Excel is back on track. Volume 4 was a bit disappointing, and the constant references to pedophilia were more creepy than funny. But, with ""Secrets & Lies"", the Excel Saga is back with the whacked-out parodies and incredibly unconventional humor. Here are a few great moments:
* A Power Rangers parody that is actually funny! Watanabe and the gang (looks like the Ropponmatsus are regulars now) fight for justice! Except that there's really no crime in F-City, so they start taking down non-crimes (loaning money, extramarital affairs, poking for change at the pop machine....)
* Pedro and Gomez face-off! That should be enough to get you to pick up this DVD ... but they also end up doing a great Dragonball Z parody.
* A sequel to Menchi's adventure, including a few surprise returning characters. Can he and his new friend make it around the world in 80 ... hours? Steel! Chow mein! The Alps Corporation! Remember, this episode working for you!
* A rock star parody and a yaoi parody rolled into one! And some suggestive yet hilarious shadowplay as Key (the rock star) moves his hands down the shaft of his guitar.
* Less super-deformed humor: the animation is back to the more realistic style from earlier episodes.
* Pedro and Menchi get their turns narrating the ""Upcoming episode"" sequence. And ... Excel actually does the sequence talking at normal speed!
If you thought that Excel Saga was in a decline with volume 4, you'll be pleased to see that Vol. 5 reverses the trend. Excel has not run out of far-out humor, and it's still the all-time funniest anime.",1046217600,4,1582,4.756363636363637
