8176329,5,B000NA6C36,"Gee, I don't know how to put this movie in words. There was some details left out or were not followed through, but it was still a well acted movie on Pedro Infante's and Blanca Estela Pavon part. This movie arrived in good condition. Again, couldn't wait to watch it. Pedro's character saw Pavon's character like a little sister. Blinded by the fact that she fell inlove with him. From what I understand the plot was staged at the starting of the Mexican Revolution. It's like you know his beloved died in his arms and what the heck, he was going to fight. I cried when he rode off into the mountains when she died, and he was left crying, but with his head held high. The view was unforgettable. He realized to late what she did for him. Silvia Pinal's character was very selfish and spoiled. Oh and I wanted to know if Pedro's character ever reclaimed his inheritence? I guess we'll never know. Great acting on the main characters, the plot was sketchy, but it told a story. Alittle mellow dramatic on the girlfriend part. I almost forgot to mention the padrino. He reminded me of the Scrooge from the original ""Christmas Carols"", he seemed very evil. But it remains a good movie to watch over and over again. I hope this review was helpful in some ways. I still admired Pedro Infante's acting and his form as a true Mexican. You need a good script to make you a great artist, but it's also how you perform the part is what says a lot about how serious you are about your craft and Pedro Infante was one of those actors. Very talented. Why do the great ones die so young and foolishly?",1307232000,2,1588,4.386440677966101
8176330,5,B000NA6C36,"I'm currently having a Pedro Infante movie orgy, rewatching most of his films one by one.  This is one of my favorites.  Previous reviewers have given a summary and mentioned the irony of the early death of Blanca Estela Pavn, Infante's good friend in real life.
The title seems prophetic; we lost a fine actress.

In this movie, as in Tizoc, I'm fascinated by the way the film treats indigenous people -- and the language it gives them.  Pedro, of course, is unaffected by prejudice  (as he is in Angelito Negro) ... well, not unaffected, but he doesn't seem to have the innate bigotry rampant in the times (pre-civil rights movement in US).  His characters display a heartfelt desire for social justice.  His singing is a pleasure to listen to and his charisma is undeniable. I particularly enjoy watching his expressive eyes.

Social issues aside, this, like most of his movies, is a pleasure to watch.  Infante is still el dolo de Mxico and other latino countries including the US, and his films and songs continue their appeal long after his untimely death in 1957. Read the comments under some of his many video clips on youtube to see his continued multinational, multigenerational appeal.

I think his films --even those without subtitles-- are very accessible to English language viewers;  those with English subtitles add another layer of enjoyment to Spanish-speakers, as the subtitles tend to be bad, if not howlers.",1292457600,,1428,4.908333333333333
8176331,5,B000NA6C36,"In La Mujer Que Yo Perdi(The Woman That I Lost, 1949), Pedro Infante plays Pedro Montano, an outlaw who hides out in the mountains after he accidentally kills a man who assaulted a woman(Silvia Pinal). After seeing dozens of innocent ""Indians"" brutally killed by soldiers, Montano takes an oath to fight for them. While hiding out in the mountains, Montano starts to fall in love with Maria(Blanca Estela Pavon), an Indian woman.

La Mujer Que Yo Perdi/The Woman That I Lost has a very ironic title as Pavon died the same year it came out in theaters. The late Blanca Estela Pavon looks very lovely in this film; I can see why Montano would fall in love with her. LMQYP is a solid film and it was made during the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema when millions of people would flock to theaters to see a movie. Nowadays, Mexico's film industry is only pumping out 10-20 movies a year and most of them go straight to home video. This film is a must-see for fans of Pedro Infante and Blanca Estela Pavon.",1253404800,5,997,4.478021978021978
8176332,5,B000NA6C36,"if anyone knows about mexican cinema at its finest should remember Pedro Infante. any pelicula or movie with this icon should be purchased and watched, then kept in your special list with the golden cinema classics. He always shines in every movie he ever made. and to have any of his movies to collect is a treasure. This movie is no different. it should be purchased and collected. He is great.",1187827200,4,396,4.591549295774648
8176333,5,B000NA6C36,Pedro and Blanca were great together in this film as they were in all the others they made together. I almost didn't recognize her as the indian girl who falls in love with her patroncito Pedro. Pedro as always proves himself as an actor and Blanca was great in her role too.great movie.,1069286400,,287,4.433962264150943
