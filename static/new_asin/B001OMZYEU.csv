okay I watched this on Netflix and eventually found the story so interesting I bought it.

It is EXTREMELY sexual and violent and very very adult, but it is a unique and interesting story.  I found it very compelling and I really did enjoy it.  I suggest it to anyone who likes unconventional animes and isn't easily offended.",1312848000,,331,4.559322033898305
8330951,5,B001OMZYEU,"Speed grapher is by far one of the best anime i have ever seen. The music, the characters, the fictional world of corruption is all to honest. It is very adult not suited for children oblivious to sex, drugs, greed, and the lustful desires in  which man has when it comes to Money and Power. It is economically, emotionally, psychologically, socially very realistic-fiction. However, this is a very Sci-fi story that has a bit of a Lolita-ish romance in it. Speed grapher will stun you , grip you and the suspense will leave you wanting more. definitely this is a story you will end up watching mostly in 1 or 2 days.",1301270400,,617,4.508928571428571
8330952,5,B001OMZYEU,"You've watched Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Cowboy Bebop, The Slayers, and a few
more titles.. And your looking for something a little more mature, and chalked full of
blood, action, dark moments, and riveting story. Well, this is it! So, Speed Grapher; a tale
of a photographer named Saiga, and his killing camera! I won't spoil to much about
the series, other than the fact that it is a lot of fun to watch and extremely awsome for a
sunday afternoon. Definiatly watch it! Now on to the box: I am not a big fan of viridian collections
only because the packaging tends to get a little bit destroyed after a while, but if you take care
of it, it shouldn't be a problem. Now there is a small logo on the top left hand corner of the dvd
that ruins the cover ""Viridian Collection"" is the logo, and it contrasts with the colors on the cover.. But
if you don't mind that then you should pick this dvd up as apposed to the other more expensive Dvd box-set.
My overall final analysis: awsome series, awsome show, definatley pick this up! Also, Christopher Sabat (plays vegeta/piccolo
in dbz, and kikuycho in samurai 7) is also in this series.",1298764800,3,1129,4.4326923076923075
8330953,4,B001OMZYEU,"The story line and character development is top notch as is the art work.  The only disappointing and unbelievable part in the series is how dense the ""good guys"" seem to be.  Saiga and the police captain always seem to wait around for the bad guys to get ready and wound up before they start fighting/attacking the bad guys.  This usually results in them getting their ""cans"" kicked unnecessarily.

The other very disappointing thing in this version of the series, and the reason I deducted one star, was the poor sound quality.  The background music is always so loud that you have to really crank up the volume to be able to clearly hear the dialog.  Of course that means you get your ear drums blasted when the fights and attacks break out or one of the characters starts yelling about something.  So you're continually fiddling with the volume control.

All in all it's still a great series with an intriguing plot.",1261440000,2,920,4.635802469135802
8330954,5,B001OMZYEU,"This is a highly recommended series for those seeking a well-conceived yet dark, violent, and gritty mature anime.  Unlike another series I panned for injecting awkward sex scenes in vain pursuit of recognition as a ""mature"" title (Moonlight Mile), the presence of such scenes and also violent imagery are specific to the tale being told here.  A tale centering on the excesses and decline of Japanese society but most importantly that of those in the most powerful positions...and in the most general terms how some others choose to try to right these wrongs and/or preserve at least some pockets of innocence in the world.

Leads Saiga and Kagura are always compelling, with a complex relationship not least due to heroic photojournalist Saiga being significantly older than teenaged Kagura.  Don't be misled though, as this otherwise boundary-pushing show treats this relationship with proper caution and respect.  Not to spoil things, I will just note that from beginning to end and indeed as a primary motivating force for the tale, Saiga only seeks to do right by the innocent Kagura.

Not so innocent but also fascinating characters include Saiga's (very) aggressive girlfriend Ginza and an always interesting batch of main villains led by the mysterious and manipulative Suitengu.  The plot includes some biology-oriented sci-fi, so expect exciting action and disturbing creatures as the delivery mechanism of much of the aforementioned violence.

Judging the DVDs technically, the high point of the series is the 5.1ch sound effects and English voice acting.  Christopher Sabat (Saiga) and Monica Rial (Kagura) really bring the goods here, and there is no weak actor in the entirety of the supporting cast.

Nothing is perfect however, and Speedgrapher does suffer from something that might cripple a lesser union of story and character: sometimes truly weak animation.  This issue most infamously manifests in earlier episodes, where automobiles are surprisingly badly animated.  Other episodes might show oddly sparse and simply environments.  The show is still largely well-animated, just with surprising lapses coming from the studio that produced the likes of Solty Rei and Last Exile.",1258761600,7,2199,5.357558139534884
8330955,5,B001OMZYEU,Speedgrapher is a gritty grimy adventure into the underworld of Tokyo as it is in this series.  Greed and sex fuel most everything in the series.  The series is kinky beautiful and messes with your head.,1252713600,,203,4.611111111111111
