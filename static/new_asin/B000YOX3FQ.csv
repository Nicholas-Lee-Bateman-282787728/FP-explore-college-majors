3033679,1,B000YOX3FQ,"The cartoon Horton Hears a Who is fine, but also on the DVD is Horton Hatches an Egg. The Book of Horton Hatches an Egg is also a nice story that teaches your kids to keep their word and do what they say.  But in the Carton on this DVD there is a scene that's not in the book.  When Horton is on the ship, a fish comes out of the water and says ""Now I've seen everything"" then pulls out a gun and puts it to his head and fires the gun and the fish falls back in the water. I don't know about you but I couldn't believe this was in a Dr Seuss story.  I went to the Walmart where I bought the DVD and told them and they pulled the DVD off the shelve right then.  I will not buy anymore Dr. Seuss DVD, I will only read the books. I only gave this DVD one Star because I had too.",1205712000,16,775,3.6787878787878787

3033681,4,B000YOX3FQ,"To promote the feature-length computer animated remake of Horton Hears a Who!, Warner Bros. release of the Dr. Seuss Deluxe Collection on DVD features not only the original half-hour Chuck Jones cartoon, but three more Dr. Seuss animated films, including the Butter Battle Book, Daisy-Head Mayzie and Horton Hatches the Egg. The first three were appropriately created with the help of Theodor Geisel himself (which of course is Dr. Seuss) who aided in creating additional song lyrics and worked as a producer.

Horton Hears a Who! is a classic animated short originally made for TV that looks amazing in its newly remastered form, as well as retaining all of its charm and family-friendly appeal that it had back in 1970. A jungle elephant named Horton happens upon a floating dust speck that emanates a tiny voice shouting for help. He places it on a peculiarly pink clover for safe-keeping, but a sour kangaroo, with a devilishly obnoxious joey in her pouch, demands that action be taken against the seemingly senile elephant, who is the only one that can hear the tiny voices. The microscopic town of Whoville that thrives in the dust speck must band together to make themselves heard, before they succumb to a horrible fate at the hands of the kangaroo and her band of monkey-like henchman known as the Wickersham brothers.

Obvious parallels to government investigatory committees such as the House Un-American Activities Committee can be drawn, as well as red scare fearmongering and Horton representing a nonconformist savior of social injustices, but from a child's perspective, the film beautifully captures the simple theme that ""a person's a person, no matter how small."" It takes great disaster for the Whos to believe Dr. Who-Vee, the scientist who communicates with Horton, that their world sits on the end of an elephant's nose, just as it almost takes the death of an innocent elephant to convince the Nurse Ratched-fashioned kangaroo that the tiny world indeed exists. Banding together for an uncompromising friendship, Horton and Who-Vee shed light on simple, short and sweet morals that immortalize this award-winning cartoon.

The Zooks and the Yooks do battle in the second short, Dr. Seuss' Butter Battle Book, directed by Ralph Bakshi, involving two towns divided by an enormous wall. The Yooks spread butter on the top of their bread, while the ""uncouth"" Zooks eat bread butter side down. The pervading theme of ""never give up"" is at times dwarfed by the search for bigger and better technology, and the stubbornness of two communities that will undoubtedly never see eye to eye, but this wildly inventive short is still highly entertaining. Making use of Escherian backgrounds and a thought-provoking cliffhanger conclusion, the highlight of the film are the many lines of completely made-up rhyming words and the Butter-Up Band's song stating that you should ""believe in yourself and the bread that you butter.""

Daisy-Head Mayzie, narrated by the Cat in the Hat, finds a symbiotic daisy growing out of the head of blonde child Mayzie. Her classmates mock her incessantly in a catchy tune, and she quickly abandons friends and family for fame and fortune with a false-faced agent. She finds her dream but loses her way, and by the end she realizes, in morals that are spelled out for the audience, that ""love means more than fame and glory."" This short is the most musically oriented, although simultaneously the most forgettable.

Lastly, a Merrie Melodies cartoon entitled Horton Hatches the Egg is included, featuring a bird also coincidentally named Mayzie, who convinces the simple-minded Horton to sit on her egg while she goes on vacation. ""An elephant's faithful 100%,"" explains Horton repeatedly, as he suffers through winter storms and the bullying of his jungle friends, and finally the humiliation of being captured by hunters and placed in a circus sideshow. The lazy Mayzie, who frequently dons a Katharine Hepburn impression, returns to reclaim her egg, only to find it ready to hatch, thanks to Horton's unyielding dedication. A funny and wry short, this film is the least like Dr. Suess' more heavily influenced other works and takes on the very recognizable aura of a Looney Tunes classic.

The entire set is a pure delight for Dr. Seuss and nostalgia fans and should make a great evening of preparation for viewers who plan to see the computer animated remake of Horton Hears a Who! due out March 2008.

In spite of the calls to ""boil that dust speck, beezlenut boil"", and threats of ""he's going to be roped, he's going to be caged"", Horton stands true to his convictions and doesn't budge. The citizens of Whoville discover just in time that Dr. Who-Vee was absolutely right that a world existed beyond the limits of their town. What a novel thought. The Butter Battle Book is another good story for illustrating how silly and hostile people can be toward others who don't conform to their norms. Many of Seuss's books, some made into videos, draw attention to cultures of conformity. The DVD also has Daisy-Head Mayzie. In this story, young Mayzie has a daisy growing on top of her head. No one quite knows what to do about it until an agent comes along and makes her famous. The moral to the story is that love is more important than fame and fortune. Horton Hatches the Egg is also on this DVD. Horton takes care of a bird egg until it hatches, yes, an elephant sitting on an egg.

3033711,2,B000YOX3FQ,"This movie is disappointing.  This wouldn't be the case if the packaging was not so deceptive.  The front of the package contains a bright, fun illustration of a modern Horton, not the somewhat dim and very old Horton contained on the short.  It might be ""classic"" and valuable in that regard, but not when that is not what one expects.  This is not particularly kid friendly.  It's weird and a little scary.

The back of the packaging says ""The Original TV Classic"" - a note I did not see when I purchased the DVD. Looking at the package front seemed to satisfy any questions one might have, and is usually sufficient research when purchasing a DVD one is somewhat familiar with.  However, even if I had read the claim on the back of the DVD, I'd be misled as this is not actually the original TV Classic.  It is a 1989 remake.

Everything about this DVD is false advertising. Whether one likes the content of the DVD or not means little.  You would have to really do your research to discover what is actually on this DVD and purchase it intentionally as a result.

3033722,5,B000YOX3FQ,"20the Century Fox has just released a big-screen version of the Dr. Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who, but did you know the story actually made its debut on the small screen nearly 40 years ago?  In 1970 the story came to TV in a half-hour animated special produced by legendary Warner Bros. director, Chuck Jones.  Responsible for some of the best Bug Bunny cartoons ever produced, Jones was no stranger to the works of Theodor Geisel, AKA Dr. Seuss, having directed another Seuss classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas a few years earlier.

I recall watching the special when I was a kid but had nearly forgotten about it until Warner Bros. released the special on a brand new deluxe DVD that also features several other cartoon shorts based on Dr. Seuss' books.  Horton is a friendly, imaginative elephant that is the only one who can hear the voices coming from a spec of dust, the tiny world of the Whos.  Berated and made fun of by other inhabitants of the jungle, the courageous Horton protects the spec of dust with his own life, proclaiming, ""A person is a person, no matter how small.""  While Horton is a fantastic children's fable it also offers a strong morale message of standing up for what you believe in, no matter what peer pressure you are under.  I only hope the message is not lost in the big screen version.  If nothing else, the film has made it possible that the original animated tale has been released on DVD, completely remastered and looking better than ever.  The colors are bold and bright and it brought back great memories, as it has not been shown on TV in decades.  The wonderful cast included Hans Conreid as Horton as well as the narrator; June Foray (best known as the voice of Rocky the Squirrel) as Jane Kangaroo and Cindy Lou Who; and Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger and sung the immortal Grinch song.

It would be great if just this story had been released on DVD but thankfully, the DVD packs in several other features.

Horton Hatches the Egg is a Merrie Melodies animated short produced by Warner Bros. in 1942.  it is adapted from the Dr. Seuss book of the same name and introduces Horton, the friendly elephant who sits on the eggs of a lazy bird named Mayzie so she can go on vacation.

Dr, Seuss' Butter Battle Book was produced as a TNT Network special in 1989.  This tale of absurdity to the extreme was directed by Ralph Bakshi, known more for his adult-themed underground animated films like Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic, than for children's animation.  The story is about two different races, the Yooks and the Zooks, who have a dispute on which side of their bread to butter.  This is Seuss at his eccentric best.

Daisy Head Mayzie was another TNT Network special featuring the Cat-in-the-Hat narrating the story of a little girl named Mayzie who grows a daisy out of the top of her head.  This one is only average and suffers from weak animation.

Finally, In Search of Dr. Seuss, is a 90 minute movie/documentary produced in 1994.  Kathy Najimy plays a reporter who comes to the home of Dr. Seuss to learn all she can about him.  Through a series of sketches where she meets various characters, she finds out surprising facts about the author.  The film co-stars numerous stars including Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart.  While it would have been nice to have a more up-to-date and academic look at Seuss' works, this silly film is strangely appropriate.

The DVD is a must-have for Dr. Seuss fans.",1213574400,21,3516,4.60513643659711

3033724,3,B000YOX3FQ,"This is the 1970 version of Horton Hears a Who as produced by Warner Brothers legendary director Chuck Jones.  It is fine.

Also included in this collection is the Warner Bros version of ""Horton Hatches The Egg"". This Merry Mellodies cartoon version from 1942 (complete with that lovable theme song)is great for kids.. well up until the scene where Horton is being shipped back to civilization to be a part of the circus.  A Peter Lorre-esque fish sees Horton perched on the boat (on his egg and tree of course) and replies ""now I've seen everything"".. He then pulls out a gun and blows his brains out.  My wife and I were horrified as we watched in the company of our 5 year old son.  I am not a prude, and appreciate a good joke.  I've looked at editorial reviews of this cartoon and have seen this scene described as a ""gag"". Suicide might have been quite the joke in 1942... but the scene is shockingly odd and offensive in 2008. I would hate for someone who has had a suicide in their family to watch this unprepared.  I must say we are still numb and I ran to the computer to write this review.  If you are going to show this to kids..you should watch this scene first yourself..or perhaps skip this story all together.  Sadly.. it's the best one on the DVD and I am saddened that the brilliant folks at Warner Brothers chose to keep this little scene in without some kind of warning or perhaps a duplicate track in the extras with the full version.  That scene is never showed on TV, but here it is..in its unedited, ""unrated"" glory.",1211155200,6,1540,4.390845070422535

3033729,4,B000YOX3FQ,"I remember this from when I was a child, and wanted to see the original again before the new animation comes out.  It was the same animation I recall (the Deluxe DVD Edition).  I had forgotten the details of the story - I remember ""we're here, we're here, we're here!!"".  And then I was fascinated that one reviewer thought this was an anti-abortion message.... So, with that review in mind, I watched, and I can see WHY someone might interpret it that way, but certainly not a child who knows nothing about such things.  From a child's perspective (and my memory as the youngest in the family) it's more a message of ""hey don't forget about me"", and the kind people like Horton who stick up for the little guy against overwhelming odds.  (I just read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Is-the-What-Vintage/dp/0307385906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Is the What (Vintage)</a>&nbsp;- and trust me, there are whole generations all over the world being slaughtered while the rest of the planet just shrugs.)  So, anti-abortion?  There are so many other interpretations.

Meanwhile, another reviewer was shocked at the fish in another of the cartoons on the DVD taking out a revolver and shooting himself in the head...  Ever seen Roadrunner / Coyote cartoons where they constantly blow each other up?  If you really consider what they're doing, it's really quite violent.  Remember the rhyme ""..I don't know why she swallowed the fly.. perhaps she'll die...""?  I overheard a mother reading a sample of that to her daughter in a bookstore, and put it aside saying it was ""sick"".  Read any Brothers Grimm?  Hopefully children will not take these things literally because they don't have the context of an adult... hopefully.

This is a classic Seuss story with his usual moral message.  I think it's about compassion, faith, responsibility to the world community, and friendship.  These are things a child wouldn't understand - to them it's about a cute elephant who befriends a tiny community of cute tiny people that can't defend itself.  If you're not sure, watch it before your child sees it.",1206835200,,2139,5.1686046511627906

[I'm sure the Jim Carey movie will be fun also] However, the other 3 cartoons are a waste of your life. Horton Hatches the Egg is done by Warner Brothers and it looks like all the commercial stylized cartoons that came out with Bugs Bunny and the like with the same political and social satire thrown in. [one word: camp] Butter Battle Book and Daisy-Head Mayzie look like they were drawn with a pencil and then redrawn by the inkers, very rough and unfinished, very similar to watching an entry in the Animation Festival. Now if someone could explain to me how Horton's Who's and the Grinch's Who's are the same....or what? Does the Grinch live on the spec also?",1206576000,2,760,4.5144927536231885

Overall, I would say that this movie is a good deal of fun.  The story, with its Seussian dialogue, is always a delight, and the visuals are pretty amazing.  Seuss is a really interesting visual artist with an utterly unique vision.  I might be the only one to see this, but there seems to be an abstractly nightmarish quality to almost all of his creations.  I don't know what it is, and I definitely can't pinpoint it, but there is something about the looks of his characters that make them all a little creepy, even Horton.  So, just watching live animation of his artistic creations is entertaining in itself.

When it comes to the story, its fun and has a strong moral message, but unfortunately, it drags in a lot of areas.  In particular, I was not very happy with most of the songs: They detracted more than added.

I have not seen the newly released film, but from what I hear, it changes a lot from the original book (although it is apparently delightful in its own way).  Either way, I still recommend one check out this version, which stays true to the original's sense of social justice, while also maintaining the stunning art of Seuss, which the new version morphs to the point where they are not recognizable as Seussian characters anymore.",1205884800,,1297,4.551724137931035

3268178,4,B000YOX3FQ,"To promote the feature-length computer animated remake of Horton Hears a Who!, Warner Bros. release of the Dr. Seuss Deluxe Collection on DVD features not only the original half-hour Chuck Jones cartoon, but three more Dr. Seuss animated films, including the Butter Battle Book, Daisy-Head Mayzie and Horton Hatches the Egg. The first three were appropriately created with the help of Theodor Geisel himself (which of course is Dr. Seuss) who aided in creating additional song lyrics and worked as a producer.

Horton Hears a Who! is a classic animated short originally made for TV that looks amazing in its newly remastered form, as well as retaining all of its charm and family-friendly appeal that it had back in 1970. A jungle elephant named Horton happens upon a floating dust speck that emanates a tiny voice shouting for help. He places it on a peculiarly pink clover for safe-keeping, but a sour kangaroo, with a devilishly obnoxious joey in her pouch, demands that action be taken against the seemingly senile elephant, who is the only one that can hear the tiny voices. The microscopic town of Whoville that thrives in the dust speck must band together to make themselves heard, before they succumb to a horrible fate at the hands of the kangaroo and her band of monkey-like henchman known as the Wickersham brothers.

Obvious parallels to government investigatory committees such as the House Un-American Activities Committee can be drawn, as well as red scare fearmongering and Horton representing a nonconformist savior of social injustices, but from a child's perspective, the film beautifully captures the simple theme that ""a person's a person, no matter how small."" It takes great disaster for the Whos to believe Dr. Who-Vee, the scientist who communicates with Horton, that their world sits on the end of an elephant's nose, just as it almost takes the death of an innocent elephant to convince the Nurse Ratched-fashioned kangaroo that the tiny world indeed exists. Banding together for an uncompromising friendship, Horton and Who-Vee shed light on simple, short and sweet morals that immortalize this award-winning cartoon.

The Zooks and the Yooks do battle in the second short, Dr. Seuss' Butter Battle Book, directed by Ralph Bakshi, involving two towns divided by an enormous wall. The Yooks spread butter on the top of their bread, while the ""uncouth"" Zooks eat bread butter side down. The pervading theme of ""never give up"" is at times dwarfed by the search for bigger and better technology, and the stubbornness of two communities that will undoubtedly never see eye to eye, but this wildly inventive short is still highly entertaining. Making use of Escherian backgrounds and a thought-provoking cliffhanger conclusion, the highlight of the film are the many lines of completely made-up rhyming words and the Butter-Up Band's song stating that you should ""believe in yourself and the bread that you butter.""

Daisy-Head Mayzie, narrated by the Cat in the Hat, finds a symbiotic daisy growing out of the head of blonde child Mayzie. Her classmates mock her incessantly in a catchy tune, and she quickly abandons friends and family for fame and fortune with a false-faced agent. She finds her dream but loses her way, and by the end she realizes, in morals that are spelled out for the audience, that ""love means more than fame and glory."" This short is the most musically oriented, although simultaneously the most forgettable.

Lastly, a Merrie Melodies cartoon entitled Horton Hatches the Egg is included, featuring a bird also coincidentally named Mayzie, who convinces the simple-minded Horton to sit on her egg while she goes on vacation. ""An elephant's faithful 100%,"" explains Horton repeatedly, as he suffers through winter storms and the bullying of his jungle friends, and finally the humiliation of being captured by hunters and placed in a circus sideshow. The lazy Mayzie, who frequently dons a Katharine Hepburn impression, returns to reclaim her egg, only to find it ready to hatch, thanks to Horton's unyielding dedication. A funny and wry short, this film is the least like Dr. Suess' more heavily influenced other works and takes on the very recognizable aura of a Looney Tunes classic.

The entire set is a pure delight for Dr. Seuss and nostalgia fans and should make a great evening of preparation for viewers who plan to see the computer animated remake of Horton Hears a Who! due out March 2008.

Looking at the package front seemed to satisfy any questions one might have, and is usually sufficient research when purchasing a DVD one is somewhat familiar with.  However, even if I had read the claim on the back of the DVD, I'd be misled as this is not actually the original TV Classic.  It is a 1989 remake.

3268219,5,B000YOX3FQ,"20the Century Fox has just released a big-screen version of the Dr. Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who, but did you know the story actually made its debut on the small screen nearly 40 years ago?  In 1970 the story came to TV in a half-hour animated special produced by legendary Warner Bros. director, Chuck Jones.  Responsible for some of the best Bug Bunny cartoons ever produced, Jones was no stranger to the works of Theodor Geisel, AKA Dr. Seuss, having directed another Seuss classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas a few years earlier.

I recall watching the special when I was a kid but had nearly forgotten about it until Warner Bros. released the special on a brand new deluxe DVD that also features several other cartoon shorts based on Dr. Seuss' books.  Horton is a friendly, imaginative elephant that is the only one who can hear the voices coming from a spec of dust, the tiny world of the Whos.  Berated and made fun of by other inhabitants of the jungle, the courageous Horton protects the spec of dust with his own life, proclaiming, ""A person is a person, no matter how small.""  While Horton is a fantastic children's fable it also offers a strong morale message of standing up for what you believe in, no matter what peer pressure you are under.  I only hope the message is not lost in the big screen version.  If nothing else, the film has made it possible that the original animated tale has been released on DVD, completely remastered and looking better than ever.  The colors are bold and bright and it brought back great memories, as it has not been shown on TV in decades.  The wonderful cast included Hans Conreid as Horton as well as the narrator; June Foray (best known as the voice of Rocky the Squirrel) as Jane Kangaroo and Cindy Lou Who; and Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger and sung the immortal Grinch song.

It would be great if just this story had been released on DVD but thankfully, the DVD packs in several other features.

Horton Hatches the Egg is a Merrie Melodies animated short produced by Warner Bros. in 1942.  it is adapted from the Dr. Seuss book of the same name and introduces Horton, the friendly elephant who sits on the eggs of a lazy bird named Mayzie so she can go on vacation.

Dr, Seuss' Butter Battle Book was produced as a TNT Network special in 1989.  This tale of absurdity to the extreme was directed by Ralph Bakshi, known more for his adult-themed underground animated films like Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic, than for children's animation.  The story is about two different races, the Yooks and the Zooks, who have a dispute on which side of their bread to butter.  This is Seuss at his eccentric best.

Daisy Head Mayzie was another TNT Network special featuring the Cat-in-the-Hat narrating the story of a little girl named Mayzie who grows a daisy out of the top of her head.  This one is only average and suffers from weak animation.

Finally, In Search of Dr. Seuss, is a 90 minute movie/documentary produced in 1994.  Kathy Najimy plays a reporter who comes to the home of Dr. Seuss to learn all she can about him.  Through a series of sketches where she meets various characters, she finds out surprising facts about the author.  The film co-stars numerous stars including Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Christopher Lloyd, and Patrick Stewart.  While it would have been nice to have a more up-to-date and academic look at Seuss' works, this silly film is strangely appropriate.

The DVD is a must-have for Dr. Seuss fans.",1213574400,21,3516,4.60513643659711

Also included in this collection is the Warner Bros version of ""Horton Hatches The Egg"". This Merry Mellodies cartoon version from 1942 (complete with that lovable theme song)is great for kids.. well up until the scene where Horton is being shipped back to civilization to be a part of the circus.  A Peter Lorre-esque fish sees Horton perched on the boat (on his egg and tree of course) and replies ""now I've seen everything"".. He then pulls out a gun and blows his brains out.  My wife and I were horrified as we watched in the company of our 5 year old son.  I am not a prude, and appreciate a good joke.  I've looked at editorial reviews of this cartoon and have seen this scene described as a ""gag"". Suicide might have been quite the joke in 1942... but the scene is shockingly odd and offensive in 2008. I would hate for someone who has had a suicide in their family to watch this unprepared.  I must say we are still numb and I ran to the computer to write this review.  If you are going to show this to kids..you should watch this scene first yourself..or perhaps skip this story all together.  Sadly.. it's the best one on the DVD and I am saddened that the brilliant folks at Warner Brothers chose to keep this little scene in without some kind of warning or perhaps a duplicate track in the extras with the full version.

So, with that review in mind, I watched, and I can see WHY someone might interpret it that way, but certainly not a child who knows nothing about such things.  From a child's perspective (and my memory as the youngest in the family) it's more a message of ""hey don't forget about me"", and the kind people like Horton who stick up for the little guy against overwhelming odds.  (I just read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Is-the-What-Vintage/dp/0307385906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Is the What (Vintage)</a>&nbsp;- and trust me, there are whole generations all over the world being slaughtered while the rest of the planet just shrugs.)  So, anti-abortion?  There are so many other interpretations.

Meanwhile, another reviewer was shocked at the fish in another of the cartoons on the DVD taking out a revolver and shooting himself in the head...  Ever seen Roadrunner / Coyote cartoons where they constantly blow each other up?  If you really consider what they're doing, it's really quite violent.  Remember the rhyme ""..I don't know why she swallowed the fly.. perhaps she'll die...""?  I overheard a mother reading a sample of that to her daughter in a bookstore, and put it aside saying it was ""sick"".  Read any Brothers Grimm?  Hopefully children will not take these things literally because they don't have the context of an adult... hopefully.

This is a classic Seuss story with his usual moral message.  I think it's about compassion, faith, responsibility to the world community, and friendship.  These are things a child wouldn't understand - to them it's about a cute elephant who befriends a tiny community of cute tiny people that can't defend itself.  If you're not sure, watch it before your child sees it.",1206835200,,2139,5.1686046511627906

[I'm sure the Jim Carey movie will be fun also] However, the other 3 cartoons are a waste of your life. Horton Hatches the Egg is done by Warner Brothers and it looks like all the commercial stylized cartoons that came out with Bugs Bunny and the like with the same political and social satire thrown in. [one word: camp] Butter Battle Book and Daisy-Head Mayzie look like they were drawn with a pencil and then redrawn by the inkers, very rough and unfinished, very similar to watching an entry in the Animation Festival. Now if someone could explain to me how Horton's Who's and the Grinch's Who's are the same....or what? Does the Grinch live on the spec also?",1206576000,2,760,4.5144927536231885

Overall, I would say that this movie is a good deal of fun.  The story, with its Seussian dialogue, is always a delight, and the visuals are pretty amazing.  Seuss is a really interesting visual artist with an utterly unique vision.  I might be the only one to see this, but there seems to be an abstractly nightmarish quality to almost all of his creations.  I don't know what it is, and I definitely can't pinpoint it, but there is something about the looks of his characters that make them all a little creepy, even Horton.  So, just watching live animation of his artistic creations is entertaining in itself.

When it comes to the story, its fun and has a strong moral message, but unfortunately, it drags in a lot of areas.  In particular, I was not very happy with most of the songs: They detracted more than added.

I have not seen the newly released film, but from what I hear, it changes a lot from the original book (although it is apparently delightful in its own way).  Either way, I still recommend one check out this version, which stays true to the original's sense of social justice, while also maintaining the stunning art of Seuss, which the new version morphs to the point where they are not recognizable as Seussian characters anymore.",1205884800,,1297,4.551724137931035
