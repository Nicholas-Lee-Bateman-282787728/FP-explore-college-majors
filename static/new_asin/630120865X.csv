Germans at the time wore their hair long, which was wrong for the time period in Poland, so the movie company asked the US military for extras since we all had short hair. It took all day to film the scenes where the magician (Alan Arkin) was supposed to fly from the balcony down onto the stage. The magician was a no show in the movie and Arkin wasn't in Munich. Louise Fletcher and Valery Perrine were though. We wore tuxedos that were one-piece outfits with a zipper down the middle. We all wore tennis shoes, but you don't see them in the movie. We did the scenes over and over until we got it just right. We filed into the opera house and took our seats. Then we stood up and clapped and chanted for the magician to fly. Pretty simple, but it took all day. Something was always just not quite right. Anyway, I didn't see the movie for years afterward. It was released in Israel but not in the US for the longest time. The movie was absolutely terrible and made no sense to me. I still consider it one of the lousiest movies ever made.",1400976000,,1177,4.235555555555556

It could be said that it wrapped up the story in a way quite uncharacteristic of the author. My guess only.",1168992000,2,393,4.324324324324325
