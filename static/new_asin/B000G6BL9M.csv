8129028,5,B000G6BL9M,"These videos are so fun anyone who love them.  The vibrant colors, great music, and stories of friendship bring back a lot of happy memories of my childhood.  I also love the ballet instructions at the end of each one.",1400803200,,218,4.425
8129029,5,B000G6BL9M,"Good movie, Good acting. My daughter loves these series and will have in our home for a good while because they teach good lessons. Penelope and Priscilla can be kind of mean to Angelina, but then again what child out there is perfect, but they realize that being mean and hateful gets you no where. Recommend for little girls who need to learn to be nice and sweet.",1391040000,,366,4.397058823529412

8129033,5,B000G6BL9M,I love the Angelina Ballerina video series.  They inspire young dancers while teaching them the life skills necessary for the art.,1247529600,,130,5.190476190476191
8129034,4,B000G6BL9M,"I want to say that the review that states Angelina's bad behavior is innacurate, the reviewer must not have watched the entire film. Having watched waaaay too many times with my 2.5 year old (who loves it!) I can say Angelina's character is just like her usual character- sweet, fun loving, and usually accidentally getting into a little trouble, but for the right reasons. I would recommend this to all Angelina fans!",1229731200,5,418,4.819444444444445
8129035,1,B000G6BL9M,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday (a BIG Ballerina Princess Fan-LOL). I haven't let her watch it since. I was so disappointed in the story line . I was hoping for something more along the lines of a sweet ballerina friendship story , and NOT one where the little mouse characters act like spolied brats. My daughter loves her Angelina doll , but in this story Angelina acts like a mean little girl, who to get her way blames her mistakes on others. Not exactly something I would want my little daughter to learn.",1182297600,3,525,4.479166666666667
