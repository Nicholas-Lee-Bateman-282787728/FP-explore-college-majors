8721957,5,B010CG2DMO,"We had the privilege of viewing this well thought of and well told story in it's inaugural showing in our area. I loved it so much so that when it was being shown in a Film Festival near our home, I made it a point to view it once again on the big screen. The quality of each character's portrayal and the cinematography draws you in to the story as you suspend reality for the time you spend watching. This movie, The Breaking Point, will definitely be added to our collection!",1436140800,2,478,4.263736263736264
