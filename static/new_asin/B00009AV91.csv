FROM THE VAULT

HBK has always been my favorite wrestler with maybe only Randy Savage coming close to that number 1 spot. This DVD was not a documentary it was a collection of some of Shawn's matches, with HBK doing a little telling of his story introducing every thing. I was sitting here and wondering why I have not reviewed this, the real documentary or any thing else of Shawn's and thought I would pop it in. Another reviewer on this site who happens to be really good at it reviewed an HBK DVD and inspired me to so, shout out to KA.

DISC 1

1. AWA TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP-THE MIDNIGHT ROCKERS VS BUDDY ROSE & DOUG SUMMERS-this is actually a really good match as it is full of drama, these two teams tell an excellent story with this one. Most of this match is Michaels being dominated and bloodied and unable to tag in Marty Jannety. When Marty is finally tagged in things heat up and become fast paced for a while. The teams go back and forth from this point on taking turns dominating the other until a great end. 5/5

2. I-C CHAMPIONSHIP-LADDER MATCH-SHAWN MICHAELS VS RAZOR RAMON-now this was not the first ladder match in the WWF, it wasn't even the first ladder match ever but it is probably the most remembered. This match was the culmination of a feud between these two to find out who the real I-C champ was. The story was Shawn was suspended and had to let the title go, and Razor would end up winning it while HBK was gone. Naturally when Shawn returned he claimed to be the real champ since he had never lost it, hence this grudge match here. The action in this one is great from start to finish a non stop classic in my opinion, most people don't even remember that it was a while before the ladder was brought in. This has to be for its time one of the best matches ever, probably the best of that event. Although the Owen Hart vs. Bret Hart match that opened the night could take that crown as well so that would be your call. Any way I think this is one of the most entertaining matches of all time, and that shot of Shawn jumping off of the ladder is legendary. Even in real time it looked like he was in slow motion, which is truly a great moment in wrestling history. The action in this match is great and even the ending is entertaining. I still feel to this day HBK was cheated, why couldn't Diesel just stay out there. LOL.5/5

3. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP-IORN MAN MATCH-SHAWN MICHAELS VS BRET HART-I still to this day don't understand why people talk bad about this match, this I absolutely with out a doubt one of the greatest matches in the history of the business. People talk about this match and say it is overrated and not all that entertaining, how in the world can people say that. These two gave us all a very entertaining and competitive match that was well paced and exciting in my opinion. Of course after countless iron man matches have taken place people who started watching wrestling with those ones will likely look down on this one. This was the first and still to this day the best, Bret vs. Shawn every time was excellent and this was one of those. Of course people will argue ""well this wasn't the first match to go an hour"" which is very very true but it was the first as far as I can remember with the stipulation of who ever has the most decisions within an hour is the winner. This was the third major meeting between the two and the second major meeting on pay-per-view, 1.[I-C title ladder match {first in WWF}] 2.[WWF title survivor series 92] 3.[WWF title Iron Man Match Wrestlemania 12]. Like I said before this was a well paced match all the way through but don't think that the action doesn't pick up to a quicker pace because it does. There are many memorable moments that take place during this bout like HBK sailing all the way over the turnbuckle. And the camera was in the perfect place for that shot of the time keeper taking some sweet chin music. Bret flying threw the ropes onto Shawn still lives in my mind as does HBK flying off the top turnbuckle onto Bret on the outside, sure they did that stuff before but the emotion and atmosphere really add to the action. I guess it also doesn't hurt that the camera angles are perfect during all this. Of course the real great thing about this is that between all the high spots there is a lot of real good wrestling taking place. Mix in a very exciting finale and even better over time and you have all the makings of a classic, plus the celebration afterwards is great and McMahon is hilarious. 5/5

Disc 1 has a lot of great vintage interviews and classic segments explaining situations surrounding the matches.

DISC 2

1. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP-NO HOLDS BARRED-SHAWN MICHAELS VS DIESEL-the first match that the two had with the roles reversed as far as baby face/heel goes, and unlike last time HBK came to win. This was the classic no hold barred match between the two where Diesel [Kevin Nash] used Mad Dog Vachone's [not sure I spelled that right] fake leg as a weapon. Once again like every other match on this collection people will argue that it is over rated, to me this is still a classic. Maybe it is because when I watch these it is like when I first saw it, or maybe it is because HBK is my favorite wrestler but I enjoy all these matches. This was for the time in WWF was a pretty hardcore match, I say for WWF because at the time ECW was alive and well. But for this company this was a great hardcore match before this was the norm in the company. There is a lot of good action in this match and the best friends turned enemies angle was working real well even after it started way back in 1994 between these two. To any one who says Vince doesn't care about his wrestlers [at least some of the time] should check this one out. I never really noticed it before but when Nash goes to power bomb HBK into the table notice how Vince tries to grab the video monitor out of the way but it pops up into the air. Shawn wins this one after some sweet chin music is played for Nash. 5/5

2. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP-SHAWN MICHAELS VS MANKIND-once again we have another match that people say is overrated and not as good as advertised. I really don't get it because it just seems like if the match didn't happen post DX people don't give Shawn's matches enough credit, yes his series with Kurt Angle and the hour long RAW match with John Cena are all classic but he has had classics long before those. I remember watching this match and really being worried that Shawn may not keep the belt, because at the time Mankind was a whole new breed in the WWF. I had watched Mick before in WCW and ECW [who were in the house that night] and was well aware of what he could do. But I relaxed and knew Shawn would over come this obstacle, still though this was the same guy [Mankind] that took it to the Undertaker so I knew it would be interesting. The match its self was great and very entertaining, the action in this match was very well paced and did not over do any thing. It seemed to me that the story of this match played out very well and the Undertaker, Vader, & Psycho Sid appearances just added to the atmosphere. There were a lot of high spots in the match of course like the super kick off of the chair or both wrestlers falling from the top turnbuckle onto the table. Shawn takes a DQ victory for this unique match. This was not really a hardcore match or a traditional wrestling match but kinda a hybrid of the two, very unique feeling to this one. 5/5

3. HELL IN A CELL-SHAWN MICHAELS VS THE UNDERTAKER-probably the least likely to be called overrated by the casual fan and rightfully so, because this is one of the most entertaining things I have ever seen. This match took place right as the ""Attitude Era"" was kicking and DX was really rolling [I think the next night on RAW was the first time they used the DX entrance music], Shawn was even the European Champion at the time. The match is non stop action and these two just go at each other with every thing they have. To be honest this was a classic before the match even went outside and up top, Michaels fall from the cell is still great to watch though. I still think to this day that this is the best Hell in a Cell ever and I am sure a lot of people are going to disagree with me. Mankind/Undertaker will always be the most remembered and most shocking, Mick Foley/Triple H may be the most brutal as far as both getting in on each other. Even the Armageddon Hell in a Cell may be highly entertaining and wild but this one has got to be the best wrestling match to take place in the cell to me. Other then maybe the Mankind/Taker one all the others while good just seemed to be there for the sake of being there [see the DX vs. McMahon's & Big Show]. This one actually made sense between the contestants in it, it not only fit the story line but also the story that was told in the ring. All the others just seem like they were going to be matches taking place any way and then on RAW/SMACKDOWN some grabs a mike and says ""you vs. me at {pay-per-view} is now going to be........{long pause for dramatic effect}..............A HELL IN THE CELL MATCH"" and to the loud cheers of the audience the wrestlers looked shocked. To me that just says ""hey we could have a really great match but I think we need some shock value for ratings"", not all but a lot of them seem like the story line would have done fine with out the cell.  Any way the match its self is by far a classic and highly entertaining, plus the first appearance ever of Kane makes things interesting. There are a lot of high spots during this match and a lot of great wrestling action. 5/5

4. NON SANCTIONED MATCH-SHAWN MICHAELS VS TRIPLE H-this was the infamous return match for one Heartbreak Kid and in my opinion not only lived up to what it could be but really went above and beyond. Every one knows that this was the best friends turned enemies [have we seen that before] angle, and this was a really entertaining feud. The whole HHH turning on HBK and leaving him bloodied in a parking lot, and then acting like he was investigating who did it afterwards was brilliant. This match was full of high spots and a lot of exciting moments, my favorite for some reason was Shawn's expression before he jumped off the top onto Triple H and goes through the table. This has got to be one of the best hardcore types of matches I have ever seen and I am an ECW fan. Even when they were not using weapons it was still hardcore, meaning even when they were doing actual wrestling moves it did not seem like they were doing so to further themselves to a victory but to really hurt the other guy. That point was proven after the match when after Shawn won it was Triple H who was left standing. This is a real enjoyable match full of non stop action and a nice ending. 5/5

Like the first disc there are a lot of great vintage interviews and classic segments explaining situations surrounding the matches. This is a wonderful release that I think every wrestling fan should own, a great addition to the collection I guarantee it. There is also an excellent alternate video commentary from Shawn and Nash for their match on here, it is highly entertaining and informative.",1222732800,4,11209,4.319239904988123
1882430,5,B00009AV91,"First off, this DVD is a MUST OWN for any and all fans of the ""Icon"" HBK, Shawn Michaels!  That being said, I find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this DVD package.

At the time all this footage was being compiled, Shawn was in retirement following a chronic back injury that wasn't healing properly.  Forcing him to retire and leave the ""squared circle"" on a very premature basis, this DVD WOULD have captured all the great moments of his career.  Turns out not to be so.  Why?  Because the Heartbreak Kid isn't done yet!

That is where this DVD is different from many others.  While many people are arguing and complaining that this comilation is to short and doesn't do him justice, I believe in just the opposite.  I believe the WWE changed the direction of the DVD following the official full-time return of Michaels.  Instead of creating an all-out tribute DVD, they are merely giving viewers the very beginnings of his career; those matches up to this point that were essential for both Shawn and the company!\

The evidence is there, being that the last match on the DVD is his come-back match against Triple H.  The WWE and the DVD is showing that there is so much more to come from this great superstar, and not to worry because he'll create many more classic matches for his next DVD tribute.

That being said, this DVD is not short on material in the least.  As i said, I believe they are saving up more material for when he finally does retire for good.  We all know that when it comes to the wrestling world, people never really ""retire"" either!  It has the classic, over-looked and under-rated AWA tag match with Marty from his early days, as well as the first ever Hell in a Cell Match against the Undertaker; talk about a blood bath!

Then of course, the comeback match against Triple H!  I cannot tell you how much I marked out the first time HBK came back (joining the nWo) and then again when he returned to battle HHH!

This is a classic DVD that chronicles the beginning of a career that appears to have many good years left in it!  Don't think it sells anything short because it doesn't!

A few notes about the matches. The AWA match was one of the first bloody matches in the history of the AWA. The ladder match was Pro Wrestling Illustrated's match of the year as well as being awarded 5 Stars from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer. The ironman match was PWI Match Of The Year beating out the match with Mankind from Mind Games. The match with Diesel was one of the first hardcore matches in WWE history. The HIAC match with Taker got another 5 Star Match rating from Meltzer. Finally his comeback match against Triple H finished in the top three in PWI Match Of The Year voting.

1882434,5,B00009AV91,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2013.

His past reputation of backstage politics aside, Shawn Michaels will go down as one of the best performers in the history of the business as this DVD isn't an anthology or biography but this follows the format of Ric Flair's first set in which it showcases his highest profiled matches in his career (up to this point) with each match having Shawn's own comments on it & own collection of DVD extras.

with Marty Jannetty as ""Midnight Rockers"" vs. AWA Tag Team Champions Buddy Rose & Doug Somers - Now I don't have this DVD set anymore so I can't give a detailed review of the match but I remember that this match was from Shawn's stint in the AWA back in the mid-80's against what was their biggest rivals in Rose & Somers in what was heavily remembered for turning into an all out brawl both in & out of the ring resulting a bloodbath which was rare back in those days on television.  This was early Shawn still coming into his own with Jannetty so don't expect the ""showstopper"" performance here but it was good showcasing for the early years of Shawn's career.
""AWA"" Sept. 86
Extras for this chapter include a post-match interview with Greg Gagne, quick interview with Shawn, and the infamous ""Barber Shop"" episode with the breakup of the Rockers.

Ladder Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television based off the fact that Razor was the current Intercontinental Champion while Shawn claimed he was the real champion based off the fact that he was never beaten for the championship resulting in both of their championships being hung in the air. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ringpost. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""
WrestleMania X
[History Of The Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]
Extras for this match include an interview with Shawn & the pre-match highlight video showing their history going into this match.

Iron Man Match vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - Just like they did the first Ladder Match, both men also did the very first Iron Man match in WWE history & for those who don't know the rules, the match has a 1 hour time limit & the man with the most decisions at the end of the time wins the match while it should be noted that Shawn created his own ""WrestleMania Moment"" before the match got started with his entrance. Shawn worked a different style than expected with him grounding Bret with various takedowns while Bret used the same strategy by keeping Shawn down with headlocks before Shawn moved into working over the arm with armbars & a hammerlock. Things started to pick up when Shawn caught Bret off guard with a head scissors that took him to the outside before attempting a Sweet Chin Music that missed Bret & knocked out someone else before returning to working over Bret's shoulder with various holds & even using the ringpost multiple times as Shawn kept trading his offensive style from the high flying with a crossbody onto Bret on the outside to grounded wrestling with the Perfect-Plex. Bret started to get more aggressive with his offense like the coming off the top rope with a knee into Shawn's head & started focusing on his back after the backdrop over the post onto the outside with moves like the backbreaker, back suplex from the top rope, and throwing Shawn into the corner so hard that he went over the top rope & his Jose on the outside. Both men started showing signs of the exhaustion as the match kept going as Bret beat on Shawn until he was out of breath before both men started pulling out all the stops like Bret's suicide dive onto the outside & Shawn executing separate moonsaults & head scissors off the top rope. The final moments were very intense while everything that also happened after we heard a bell was controversial in it's own right but it doesn't take away that these two men delivered a quality performance.
Wrestlemania XII
[History Of The WWE Championship; Greatest Rivalries: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels]
Extras for this match include President Roddy Piper's announcement that this would be an Iron Man match, the training video showcasing both men getting ready for the match, a TV commercial for the match, and both men receiving the Slammy Award for this match.

WWE Championship/No Holds Barred Match vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his fustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair.  HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delievering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe.  I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definately a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.

Extras for this match include a short promo by Diesel, the pre-match comments from both Shawn & Diesel, two TV commercials, and the pre-match highlight video.  There is also alternative commentary with Shawn & Diesel (Kevin Nash).

WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind - Paul Bearer pushed a casket with Mankind inside of it before the match & you got the tone of what this match was going to be within the first few minutes when both men took it to the floor with Shawn stomping on the outside mat with Mankind underneath it, delivering a flying crossbody to the outside & whipping his head back onto the concrete floor. This match quickly evolved into a brawl with both men throwing fist & going back to the outside with Shawn targeting the leg after delivering a suplex that resulted in Mankind's leg slamming into the steps followed by driving the leg into the casket & various submissions. Mankind fought back working over HBK in corner with two double axe handles in the Tree Of Woe but also took punishment as his knee once again ran into the steps, took a drop toe hold to the face, and his head wrapped between the ropes but still able to catch Shawn in the Mandible Claw which caused Shawn to focus on that hand as he attacked it using a chair multiple times & stomps. Both men traded momentum from here with both taking the punishment together such as a superplex through the outside table & Mankind getting a superkick to the face with a chair on the top rope before various associates got involved. Foley stated that this was the best match in his career in his first book, Shawn would later state that this was his favorite match during his first WWE Championship defense during the ""Boyhood Dream"" run, and various people claimed this to be the match of the year for 1996 as this was a standout encounter in both mens careers.

Extras for this match include 3 promos/interviews with Shawn & a Mankind promo from the boiler room.

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Undertaker - Due to how out of hand their previous match got, Undertaker once again made history by being the first participant in a new innovative match...Hell In A Cell. This set the standard for future Cell matches & for being the first one, this was really something to watch. They dished out heavy punishment like never before & used everything they could get their hands on such as the steel steps & chairs to the point where Shawn was bleeding so much that his face would be what Gordon Solie called a ""crimson mask."" Shawn's fall towards the end would later be heavily overshadowed by Mankind's fall less than a year later but still one of the biggest highlights in Cell history along with the debut of Undertaker's brother, Kane. This was something to see for that time...and still is something to see to this day.
In Your House: Bad Blood 97
[Hell In A Cell; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]
Extras for this match include a TV commercial, a look at the Hell In A Cell, a Shawn interview that's interrupted by Undertaker, backstage interview with Shawn before the match, and a pre-match highlight video.

Non-Sanctioned Street Fight Match vs. Triple H - Shawn Michaels in-ring return for the first time in over 4 years & didn't look like he missed a step in the opening moments by taking the fight right to Triple H starting with a dive onto him. Triple H however heavily focused on punishing HBK's back non-stop with backbreakers, chairs making his moves more impactful including a DDT that busted Shawn open, using Shawn's own belt buckle, abdominal stretch...it got to the point where referee Earl Hebner had to step in when Triple H was about to go too far. Shawn had to resort to some of his old dirty tactics to fight back & dish out punishment of his own including using the chair himself to make Triple H bleed, his belt, trash can lid, a boot from one of the announcers, table, and even pulled out a ladder. Shawn put in a performance that looked like he didn't miss a step at all in the four years while Triple H showcased why (politics aside) he's one of the best in-ring generals of this generation.

Extras for this match include the pre-match highlight video & the aftermath of the match.

1882436,4,B00009AV91,Shawn Michaels is my absolute favorite wrestler. I think the DVD had alot of his great matches but i think they should have included much more extra's and matches. Such as his last match at Wrestlemania 14. And also should have had more commentary. But overall it was enjoyable and worth watching for any of his fans.,1153008000,,317,4.578947368421052

1882448,5,B00009AV91,"Shawn Michaels, the HeartBreak Kid, The Show Stopper, The Main Event, one of the greatest of all time (next to Ric Flair and Bret Hart). This DVD set is EXCELLENT, one of the best the WWE has to offer, next to Ric Flair's DVD set. Here's my review:

Disc One

the AWA tag team match (I don't know why this match was included, it's not classic and I doubt if anyone who watched the AWA back then even remembers this. Give it a look ONLY if you've never seen it, otherwise, don't bother, because the TRUE CLASSIC material is after this match.)**

vs. Razor Ramon, Wrestlemania X, Ladder Match (I had the pleasure of seeing this match on PPV and it was FANTASTIC, one of the greatest matches EVER that set the standard for ALL preceding ladder matches)*****

vs. Bret Hart, IronMan Match, Wrestlemania XII (This one was great because of both mens' wrestling acumen and the storyline of the match. Even though it's one hour, it's entertaining, but if you don't have the patience to sit through an hour long match, skip to the last few minutes, but otherwise, this match is recommended viewing.) ****3/4

Disc Two

vs. Diesel, Good Friends, Better Enemies 96 (Nash's best match ever, with a good friend no less, but the action here is just awesome. Who said that ol HBK couldn't beat a man larger than him?)****1/4

vs. Mankind, Mind Games (Oh man, this one was crazy, but @ the same time excellent, they tore the house up this night. One of the greatest matches I've ever witnessed.)*****

vs. Undertaker, Hell In A Cell, Badd Blood 97 (The very first Hell In A Cell match is one to be remembered, even though Kane's involvement ruined the finish. This was a phenomenal match.)****3/4

vs. HHH, Summerslam 2002 (After four years, it's amazing that HBK can come back and work one hell of a match. This match is great and gave HHH the best match he had since his match with Steve Austin at No Way Out 2001)****1/2

Check out the extra features as well.

Overall, this recommended to any wrestling fan. It's worth your time AND money. After viewing this DVD, you'll see why Shawn Michaels is one of the all time greats.",1140048000,2,2112,4.546174142480211
1882449,5,B00009AV91,"Very impressed with Shawn Michaels, his matches never bore me. Very exciting wrestler that keeps me on the edge of my seat each time I watch him. Great job Shawn!",1135641600,,162,4.433333333333334
1882450,5,B00009AV91,"How awesome would a 3-disc HBK set be? From the Vault is no doubt a great collection of matches (5 of them being ***** classics), but there is so much missing. Here's my thoughts:

1882451,4,B00009AV91,"The greatest matches of WWF superstar Shawn Michaels are showcased in this two-disc DVD. All of the matches are shown in their entirety with video introductions by Michaels himself. Among them are a tag team match from his early AWA days, his classic ladder match with Razor Ramon, his first World Title win over Bret Hart in a 1-hour Ironman match, his first title defense against Diesel in a brutal ""No Holds Barred"" match, and the infamous ""Mind Games"" match with Mankind. Rounding out the collection is Shawn's comeback match against Triple H in the new WWE era. It's a decent match but it definetly shows how much the product has slipped since the 90's. Overall though this is one of the finest WWF (WWE) DVD's out there.",1126396800,,726,4.6796875
1882452,4,B00009AV91,"It is very funny to see SHAWN MICHAELS as a young cocky wrestler with the over confidence attitude. I liked the extra about his beginnings in the business with his parents and friends. As for the matches,i enjoyed most of them but particularly the ones against RAZOR RAMON and the iron match against BRET HART,a great example of pure wrestling. Disc 2 is worth seeing but DIESEL,MANKIND,THE UNDERTAKER and TRIPLE H are more inclined to use chairs,staircases,ladders and even MAD DOG'S VACHON's artificial leg which gets annoying. It takes guts to get in the ring with wreslers almost twice your weight. SHAWN MICHAELS's career almost ended in 1998 when he suffered a major back injury. His return in 2002 was good news for the industry because he is indeed a showstopper. I would have liked other pure wrestling confrontation instead of the brawls included in disc 2,but they had to make choices. Another disc would have been nice. The best promo is when he turned heel against his former tag team partner MARTY JANNETY and sended him through the barbershop glass. I am sure that SHAWN has still a few years to give us. His love of wrestling is real.",1126137600,,1150,4.755
1882463,5,B00009AV91,"Hello and welcome to my review on Shawn Michaels From The Vault. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- = 0 - 8.33%-Waste of time and money.

  E  = 8.33 - 16.66%-Waste of time and money.

  E+ = 16.66 - 24.99%-Waste of time and money.

  D- = 24.99 - 33.32%-Very poor event maybe read about it.

  D  = 33.32 - 41.65%-Poor event with a little something standing out.

  D+ = 41.65 - 50%-Not a very good event but it just below passing.

  C- = 50 - 55.55%-Just below average worth a watch.

  C  = 55.55 - 61%-An average event worth a renting.

  C+ = 61 - 66.65%-Above average worth a purchase if you can find it for cheap.

  B- = 66.65 - 72.20%-Good event with a lot of good stuff. Purchase if you're a collector or interested.

  B  = 72.20 - 77.75%-Good quality event which is worth purchase and should be collected.

  B+ = 77.75 - 83.30%-Very high quality event with awesome matches. Must have for anyone.

  A- = 83.30 - 88.85%-Excellent event, must have for anyone. Lock this one away.

  A  = 88.85 - 94.40%-Extremely spectacular event with lots of great stuff. Lock this away.

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

Match One-AWA Tag Team Championship-""Playboy""Buddy Rose &""Pretty Boy""Doug Summers(C)Vs Shawn Michaels & Marty Janetty-This match was way back in Shawns AWA days and it was a tag match everyone at that time wanted to see. Those days it was rare to see blood but this match was an absolute bloodbath. They did so many great moves and there was so much excitement in this match. A great way to start this DVD off on. My rating 8.84/10.

Match Two-Ladder Match-Intercontinental Championship-Razor Ramon(C)Vs Shawn Michaels(C)-This match was made due to Shawn being stripped of his title and Razor Ramon winning a Battle Royal and then beating a opponent the next week to win the vacant title but Shawn returned from suspension and brought back with him his Intercontinental title,after months of interfering with each others matches they had a ladder match at Wrestlemania X. This match had great moves using the ladder and it was great to watch. Both men put 100% into it and that paid off big time as this was the stand out match from Wrestlemania X,its a great match from start to finish and it has a great storyline,its non stop action from start to finish in this twenty odd minute match. My rating 9.84/10.

Match Three-Ironman Match-WWE Title-Bret Hart(C)Vs Shawn Michaels-Some people critise this for having too many holds in this match, but in my personal opinion this is a great match. This match was voted number one Wrestlemania match on the Wrestlmania XX DVD. This was extreme great action from the word Ironman on the intro til it said insert disc 2,Shawn had one of the best entrances ever going on a flying fox from the rooftop landing in the crowd. This match was non stop exciting for the whole hour with lots of submission attempts,high flying moves and lots more greatness in this match. The ending of this is absolutely great as well as the aftermath of this match. My rating 9.88/10.

Match Four-No Holds Barred-WWE Title-Shawn Michaels(C)Vs Kevin""Diesel""Nash-This was another absolute brutal match in which both competitors gave it their all and gave everyone a great match. This match has alternate commentary on the DVD which is rather funny with Kevin & Shawn telling about it. This match is non stop brutal from start to finish using a wide variety of moves and weapons. My rating 9.76/10.

Match Five-WWE Title-Shawn Michaels(C)Vs Mankind-This was an absolute gem of a match,it had major bumps for nearly half an hour and it was really exciting keeping me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The ending wasn't the greatest but i'm sure they had something in mind for it,this is one of those forgotten classics and this was great. My rating 9.56/10.

Match Six-Hell In A Cell-European Championship-Shawn Michaels(C)Vs Undertaker-This match was setup due to Shawn costing Taker the WWE Title at Summerslam, they fought at Ground Zero the month before to a no contest so this match was setup. The match itself was a marvellous,bloody,brutal brawl with lots of innovation used in it with lots of great action and bumps. The match went for a good half hour non stop with both men bleeding especially Shawn,Kane debuts and that is rather good too watch too. My rating 9.92/10.

Match Seven-Street Fight-HHH Vs Shawn Michaels-This was Shawns comeback match and it was a great match against HHH in a bloody brawl which went for a good length of time. There was numerous weapons used and lots of great spots and bumps done and taken. Hopefully Shawn can do matches like this again. My rating 9.82/10.

Overall this DVD was awesome and it has absolutely stunning extras from all of these matches and more. The score this show received is 67.62/70 which is very excellent. The percentage of this is 96.60% which equals up to an A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place. I agree with the comment as this DVD is absolutely marvellous and consists of many great exciting matches. I hope this helped you.",1123372800,2,5364,4.647872340425532

Match 1- AWA Tag Team Championship- Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers-This match is a punch & kick fest. But it is very bloody & Marty Jannety got dropped onto a dining room chair in the upright position which broke his ribs. Ends in a No-Contest.

Rating- 4.5

2- Ladder Match- WM X- HBK vs. Razor Ramon-

This is a classic with a load of spots. The action starts at the first bell & went until the final bell. This match is intense & entertaining any wrestling fan would love this match

Razor Ramon Wins -Rating- 9

3- Iron Man Match- HBK vs. Bret hart

This match is far from a classic but it still has to be on this dvd. It has few too many spots & lacks pinfalls. In my opinion this match is slow until the last ten minutes. HBK wins in sudden death-Rating- 6.5

4- No Holds Barred- HBK vs. Diesel

Good match that isn't that bad compared to todays standards.

In this match HBK gets hung put through a table & brutally beaten. This match is pretty slow but it's entertaining to watch.

HBK wins-Rating- 8

5-HBK vs. Mankind-This match is slow but I like it because it has good spots & it's entertaining. Nothing wrong with this except for vader running in. No-Contest- Rating- 7.5

6-Hell In The Cell-HBK vs. Undertaker

Whoa this match is probably the best cell match tied with the 6 man & Brock v taker, It has alot of spots alot of intensity & Not one dull moment even kanes run in is exciting HBK wins

Rating- 10

7- Street Fight-HBK vs. HHH

This is a great match that has alot of spots 7 it is prbably thrid best match on this dvd. I love this match the fact that HHH plays his tactical game then HBK comes back gets you excited- HBK wins.-Rating-8.5

Rating- 56/70 = 80%

Even though this is 80 I think this is a must buy for anyone especially HBK fans",1117324800,,2039,4.244791666666667
1882465,5,B00009AV91,"September-2, 1986: The Midnight Rockers vs Playboy Buddy Rose & Prettyboy Doug Somers. AWA Tag-Team Title Match: Unfortunately for myself, I already have this match on an AWA DVD & actually reviewed the bout way back in 'The Wrestling Menu #33'. A 16 minute bloodfest where Michaels & Jannetty show their resilience after taking a massive beating and bleeding from very early on in the match. The bout ends in a no contest. Michaels basically played a moving unconscious man after the opening 5 minutes.

March-20, 1994: Shawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon (Scott Hall). Ladder Match for the InterContinental Title: Arguably one of the top 10 greatest WWE matches ever (voted tied for 6th in my 'Greatest Ever Match' poll in The Wrestling Menu #54'), this ladder match was simply groundbreaking at the time. Nothing is held back, the action begins practically immediately, the offense is innovative & both competitors play their part very well. Scott Hall's alter-ego picked up the win at WrestleMania 10, in this bout that just failed to last 20 minutes.

March-31, 1996: Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart. 60 Minute IronMan Match for the WWE Championship: The infamous WrestleMania 12 match which possibly receives more of a mixed reaction than any other WWE bout in history. Definitely not perfect, this bout has too few exciting spots & one or two too many restholds. But the psychology is amazingly real. So real, you would swear that all but the final 4 minutes were unscripted. Michaels' emotion following his sudden-death win caps it all off perfectly. While 3 alternate matches could have been placed on this DVD, this classic just had to be there.

EXTRAS

It should be noted that most of the extras are directly related to the matches featured on the DVD.

Bloodbath!: Two minute interview with Greg Gagne after the AWA match. I have no idea why this is here!!!

Be Ready: Fascinating little one minute interview during Shawn's AWA days. He was decent on the microphone for his age, but it's fair to say that he has improved since. ***Easter Egg***: Push 'left' twice with this option highlighted & you will get to see a strange & humorous dieting promo by Playboy Buddy Rose.

Barbershop: The infamous 6 minute January '92 Barbershop segment where Michaels turned heel by superkicking Marty Jannetty & throwing him through a window. This was where HBK truly began his singles career & I'm so glad this was included on this DVD. It is very well done & a genuine classic moment in WWE history. ***Easter Egg***: Push 'left' twice with this option highlighted & you get to see HBK discussing singing, dancing & his entrances.

No Rules: Good, if unspectacular, 3 minute in-ring speech concerning the WrestleMania 10 Ladder Match. This extra is handy in order to remember the heel Michaels of the early to mid nineties.

2 Champions: Documentary-like segment explaining why 2 wrestlers were walking around with 2 separate InterContinental Titles for about 5 months. Used as the promo for the WrestleMania 10 match.

Piper's Announcement: Good 8 minute face-to-face segment between HBK & The Hitman, where Rowdy Roddy Piper comes out to explain the WrestleMania 12 main event will be a 60 Minute IronMan match.

Training Video: I always like these training videos, and this 5 minute one is no exception. Focuses on both Shawn & Bret, and is mainly narrated by Jim Ross.

IronMan TV Spot: OK, although covers similar ground to the 'Training Video'.

Match Of The Year: Strange little spot from the Slammy Awards, where both Bret & Shawn accept the 'Match Of The Year' award & give a little speech.

Before They Were Superstars: Typically well produced 13 minute piece which includes interviews with Shawn, his parents & his childhood best friend.

Tell Me A Lie: Music video to the 'Tell Me A Lie' song that was used at the time of one of HBK's hiatus' from wrestling. Decent highlights of his career are included.

April-28, 1996: Shawn Michaels vs Diesel (Kevin Nash). No Holds Barred Match for the WWE Championship: This is an often over-analyzed bout from the 'Good Friends, Better Enemies' pay-per-view. It really did set out to purely be entertaining, and succeeded in doing this for most of it's 18 minutes. Despite ordinary pacing & the lack of anything great wrestling-wise, I don't mind this match at all. Nash wasn't much better mobility-wise 7 years ago than he is now!!!

This match is also available with commentary from Michaels & Nash. While the commentary is ok, it's nothing more than that, and could have been so much better. The inclusion of having Jonathon Coachman there asking them questions is a negative, as Nash & Michaels could have been hilarious if left to their own devices.

September-22, 1996: Shawn Michaels vs Mankind (Mick Foley). WWE Championship Match: Taking place at the 'Mind Games' pay-per-view, this is a truly superb match which proved that HBK could get the job done in the ring against practically any type of opponent. As Shawn said himself in the introduction to this 25 minute bout, Mick Foley's style gave him the opportunity to do something a little different & show the fans something new in his matches. Intense, well-paced & very psychological, the Disqualification ending (Vader running in) is the only real low point of this bout.

October-5, 1997: Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker. Hell In A Cell Match: A genuinely brutal & bloody half hour inside the cell for HBK. Completely disregarding the ending which saw Kane debut in the WWE, there wasn't too much wrong with this match. Apart from the brutality, the cell gimmick was used with great impact, while both wrestlers got in their fair share of offense. Whether inside or on top of the cell, the fans got what they paid for in this bout.

August-25, 2002: Shawn Michaels vs Triple H. Non-Sanctioned Match: Taking place at last year's SummerSlam, this is undoubtedly one of the most pleasant surprises I have witnessed in all my years of watching professional wrestling. No-one could have ever expected a match up to this standard, considering how long Michaels had been away from a wrestling ring. My personal Match Of The Year for 2002, this was another pure classic involving HBK. Imperfect when over-analyzed, this 28 minute brawl is pure entertainment & intensity. As Shawn said himself in the introduction to the match, he believes the bout will stand the test of time. I agree!!!

EXTRAS

Diesel Interview: Ordinary 90 second promo by Nash regarding the No Holds Barred match.

Big Daddy Cool: More of the same, but with Nash more in the 'Diesel' character. HBK throws his 5 cents worth in as well.

Good Friends: Short & mediocre promo for the upcoming pay-per-view match.

Better Enemies: More of the same, but a little better.

In Your House: Yet another promo, but this is longer, better produced & more informative. The only one of the five extras concerning this match that was really needed.

Have A Nice Day: Short little promo asking the WWE fans to pray that Mankind does not become the new WWE champion.

SlamJam Promo: Average 30 second monologue from HBK.

Mankind Promo: Classic little promo by Foley from the boiler-room.

Brain Surgeon: OK interview with Michaels on the day of the 'Mind Games' match.

Pre-Match Interview: Interview of Michaels, by Kevin Kelly, moments before the main event against Mankind. Showed fairly well that this match would be a little different than the usual HBK bout.

Hell In A Cell TV Spot: Ok little (45 second) promotional spot for the HIAC match against The Undertaker.

Building Hell: The now familiar, but good, look at the building of the cell. Narrated by Vince McMahon.

Blaze Of Glory: Nicely put together 5 minute interview of Michaels in the ring on Raw by Jim Ross. Includes a short speech by The Undertaker on the TitanTron.

Good News, Bad News: Backstage interview before the big HIAC match.

Badd Blood: Interesting & well-produced 3 minute promo looking at Michaels in general, and then the Hell In A Cell match specifically.

Nothing Left: Nicely put together look at HBK & Triple H. Some of their history is shown, but it concentrates mostly on the lead up to the 2002 return bout. Four minutes worth & includes the song ""Fight"" in the background.

Hammered!: The aftermath of the match where Triple H ruined the HBK party by savaging him with his sledgehammer.

Photo Gallery: Super clear stills of all matches on both discs of this DVD set, except the AWA bout. ***Easter Egg***: Push 'left' twice with this option highlighted & you get to see the infamous & emotional February-13, 1997 ""I lost my smile"" interview. Excellent 7 minute segment which just had to be included.

In short, this 2 DVD set is an absolute must for any wrestling fan who likes what Shawn Michaels has accomplished in the ring. Even if you are not a huge fan of HBK, 'From The Vault' would be a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection. With over 6 hours of footage, and priced favorably to alternative WWE DVD's, this set does provide value for money. While some will feel the WWE made an incorrect decision with regards to not having a 90 minute biography-type main section, those that have seen previous WWE DVD's will know that they are very imperfect anyway. So with the length of most of Shawn's matches, why not just go all out & show 7 full matches as they have done.

While some of the extras (especially on Disc 2) are a waste of space & could have been replaced by much more meaningful & insightful segments, the time wasted is fairly minimal when all is said & done. The matches were chosen well & get good replay value over the years. Overall, I definitely recommend the addition of this DVD to any wrestling fan's collection.",1114732800,4,9694,4.819168173598554

1882470,5,B00009AV91,"If only this went on longer...

HBK has gone down as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, and one of the most controversial wrestlers of all time. He was the guy to take a company who had competed with Disney, and turned it into the huge attraction it is today!

We all have read the reviews about this DVD though, and we all know Shawn Michaels. We know this DVD is great, but here are some flaws....

1. Length

If only Shawn's DVD continued... it's only like, what, got seven matches? Yeah sure, it's got the Iron Man match, but let's face it, it's basically just a real great match spread over into a one hour match. And that AWA Tag Title match wasn't as great as I had thought it would be.

2. Interviews

I believe Michael's off screen, real life persona is a tad too boring. He sometimes is at a loss for words. At least they had Kevin, Shawn and the Coach commentating on their match together, because Kevin can be pretty humourous, but Shawn doesn't do...GREAT interviews, but average ones. My opinion strictly, though...

3. Sound

We know that the quality has improved because it's on DVD, but the sound quality sucks, quite frankly (especially for a DVD). Maybe they can't get the sound better for some reason, or maybe it's at its best, but if your DVD player comes with a reverb option that changes the sound, it'll be just fine for you. Again, my opinion.

4. Not Enough Matches

I would rather they had thrown out the AWA match, and switched it for any other HBK match. There could've been the future classic, HBK vs. Y2J at WM XIX, or even Survivor Series '97, because they provide us with some HBK history, but that AWA match is mediocre. Bloodbath or not, If I wanted to see a match from the '80's, I'd take out my Ric Flair DVD and watch him wrestle Steamboat instead.

Despite these flaws, the DVD is undoubbtedly still great, and well worth a purchase.

If the DVD DID go longer though, they could leave the AWA match and add extra ones. I know that Ric Flair is an older and better wrestler than Shawn, but why not set aside these age differences and give all legendary wrestlers a 3 disc compilation of their own? I mean, imagine: Finally, a well thought out DVD for Steve Austin, instead of hundreds of hour long ones, or a future- Triple H, Rock, Taker, Kurt, Benoit & Jericho one? As we speak, Vince is trying to tie ends with Bret Hart, why not earn some of his respect with a complimenting 3 disc set which should tell the tale of the Hart saga, and give a proper send off to the fans, and Bret himself?

Granted, we're not EVER going to get a 3 disc Hogan set, though he already has a 2 disc one, but who cares? When you can watch Shawn Michaels performing mind-blowing matches, why watch some bald guy with millions of bucks coming back from being brutalized, then dropping a leg on him, every time?",1094083200,3,2837,4.3605313092979125
1882471,5,B00009AV91,"""From the Vault: Shawn Michaels"" chronicles the career of some of HBK's greatest matches.  This a 2 disc set which contains a total of seven matches.  Each match has its own separate extra features.  HBK's talks about every match before they show it.

Disc 1:

1. The Midnight Rockers vs. Playboy Buddy Rose (9/2/1986 - AWA Tag Team Championship)

I think it is great for the WWE to include Marty Jannety on this DVD.  I thought this match would be a bore, but turned into a very excting blood bath. (9/10)

One of the extra features for this match is the Rockers breaking up on an episode of WWF Superstars at Brutus The Barber Beefcake's Barbershop talkshow.

2. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon (Wrestlemania X - Intercontinenta Title/Ladder)

By far one of the best and most popular matches in WWE history.  This was the first ladder match in WWE history.  Very entertaining match.  Having a ladder match at this time in the sport was unheard of.  One of my favorite and the best matches of all time.  (10/10)

One of the extras is a promo that shows the build-up for this match.

3. Shawn Michaels vs. Bret ""Hitman"" Hart (Wrestlemania XII - WWF Title/Iron Man Match)

The WWE superstars voted this as the best match in WWE history.  I enjoyed this match, but did not think it was as good as it was hyped.  Of course, it had got to be hard to try and hold the attention of fans for over an hour.  It is great to see Hart on this DVD.  (9/10)

Good extras, including Piper making the announcement for this match on RAW and training videos of the two competitors.

Disc 1 contains two other extra features: ""Before They Were Superstars: The HBK Story"" and the ""Tell Me A Lie"" music video that was released when Michaels retired because of his back injury.

Disc 2:

1. Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel (Good Friends Better Enemies 4/28/1996 - WWF Championship/No Holds Barred)

I was not impressed with this match.  It wasn't bad, just not as good as I thought it was.  There is actually a pretty distasteful sequence in the match.  Diesel performs a crazy Jacknife Powerbomb through a table on HBK.  This is about the time wrestling began to change.  (8/10)

The extras for this match include the two cutting promos and a video highlighting the fued of HBK and Diesel.

2. Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind (Mind Games 9/22/1996 - WWF Championship)

This may be the best pure wrestling match of Foley's career.  Michaels calls it one of his best ever.  Watch for the two wrestlers go through the table and watch McMahon try to stop the match.  Sid Vicous, Vader, and Undertaker all make appearances in the match.  (9/10)

The extras include promos and interviews.

3. Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker (Badd Blood 10/5/1997 - Hell In A Cell)

This is the first Hell In A Cell match in WWF history and maybe the best.  Both competitors go all out in this match.  Watch Michaels fall on the cameraman.  It looks as if he is really beating him.  HBK takes a nasty fall off the cell and through the announce table.  Kane makes his WWF debut in the match.  (9.5/10)

The extras include promos and the construction of the cell.

4. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H (Summerslam 2002 - Non-Sanctioned Street Fight)

HBK makes his return after 4 years being retired.  This is one of my favorite matches of all time.  There are too many insane spots and bumps to mention.  Michaels made a grand return and shows why he is still one of the best as he wrestles today.  (10/10)

The extras include the pre-match promo and post-match attack by Triple H.  Watch his evil smile.

This DVD is a must add to your WWE collection.  Every match is entertaining.  The worst match is HBK's match with Nash, but it is still decent.

1882472,5,B00009AV91,"This is a great DVD of the Hearbreak Kid, and shows just how exciting his matches can get, with the exception of one match. This has all the classics and should be bought by anyone who is  an HBK fan.

The first one with the AWA tag team championship is just a big letdown. When I saw this I nearly shook my head in disbelief. This is alright, but nowhere near as good as the other matches on the DVD. 7/10

The 60 minute iron man match: An instant classic, both men went through hell in one hour and still no one managed to be pinned in the entire match. I was shocked when the match ended and no one was pinned, then to Bret Hart's shock the match was ordered to continue. Shawn wins his first world heavyweight championship, a great match. 10/10

The first ever ladder match was a classic also, what else would you expect? I'm glad Diesel was thrown out so the match could be a fair fight. Lots of high impact in this one. Nothing as extreme as what the Hardy boys might do, but really extreme back then. I thought Shawn shouldn't have been stuck in the ropes but great ending none-the-less. 11/10

The no holds barred match with Diesel was great with lots of funny moments in it. When Shawn hit Diesel in the face with a prosphetic leg I laughed out loud for minutes. Also great when Diesel got in McMahon's face during several moments in the match. No boring moments in this whatsoever. 8.5/10

The second DVD had his matches against Mick Foley, Undertaker, and Triple H. His match with the Undertaker is the best one in my opinion.

The match vs. Mankind is another match with no boring moments at all. When both of them went throught the table I jumped to my feet. When the Undertaker came out of the crypt the intensity on his face was unbelievable. A true classic. 10/10

My favorite match on the two DVDs would be the first ever Hell in a Cell. This was and still is in the top three Hell in the Cell matches, tied at first place with Cactus Jack vs. Triple H. When Shawn and Undertaker got out of the cell I knew it would get good. Even the interference by Kane didn't ruin this match, a true classic. 11/10

The last match was against Triple H, and it was supposed to be Shawn's one time only match after 5 years, thank god it wasn't. Triple H dominated the first half of this match, but when Shawn kicks the chair in Triple H's face, that was when the match got really good. The crowds reaction was great when Shawn pulled out the table, a great match after 5 years of being away. 10/10

Besides the tag team match, this is a set of classic and non stop action matches. The extras are more than enough, with a certain group for each type of match. The only problem I have with the matches is that the second match between Razor Ramon and Shawn isn't in it. This would have been perfect instead of the tag team match. But still a great DVD.",1092873600,,2852,4.245387453874539
1882473,5,B00009AV91,"I have no personal respect for Shawn Michales, but I WILL always acknowledge how great he is in the ring
This collection of Matches highlights all of Shawn's greatest WWF/WWE Matches, and also includes a gem for the TRUE Wrestling fan: An AWA tag team match featuring Shawn Michales and his tag team partner Marty Janetty, a person who, along with Michales, became the legendary Tag Team ""The Rockers"", very few have seen the likes of them again.
Included on the DVD is also the infamous moment where Michales turned on Jannety, smashing his head through a glass window and begiining his historic singles run.
The first WWF/WWE match is the Wrestlemania X ladder match against Razor Ramoan, this is mostly remembered for being THE match that Wrestlemania X worth watching next to Bret Hart vs Owen.
Michales's display of athleticism and risk taking in this match affects the ENTIRE audience, who are with him for every bump off the ring rope and who yell in awe as he makes a splash off the ladder onto Ramaon's body, eventually Michales loses the match, but steals the show in the process.
Following this is THE most boring WWF/WWE match ever: The Ironman match against WWF/WWE Champion Bret Hart at Wrestlemania 12 pay no attention to people who claim this was a ***** classic, it wasn't, it's nothing but rest holds, brawling, and submissions, and is nothing compared to the Ironman classic The Rock and Triple H engaged in in 2000.
The second disk provides the viewer with excellent match after excellent match, Shawn takes on Diesal in a no-holds barred encounter which makes use of chairs, tables, and Mad Dog Vachons's prosphetic leg, Michales then moves on to defend the WWF/WWE Champinoship against Mankind in another out of control match that features counter moves, broken tables, leathal submissions, and interference from Vader, Sid Vicious, and The Undertaker.
Then comes the first (and greatest) Hell in a Cell match pitting SHawn Michales AGAINST The Undertaker, featuring Michales pulling off some of the ugliest bumps in Wrestling history from the top of the cell, Kane makes his debut in this match and gives Shawn the victory in the most shocking way possible.
Finally, the collection concludes with Michales' comeback match in 2002 against Triple H, and Michales proves once again, as he's been doing ever since (barring 2004's abysmal Hell in a Cell match with Triple H) that he IS one of the greatest wrestlers alive today.

- Easter Egg: WWE Thursday Raw Thursday - 2/13/1997 - Lowell, MA - HBK loses his smile (PURE, UTTER COMEDY)
- Easter Egg: HBK talks about the making of his theme music, ""Sexy Boy""
As for any complaints about the extras, I think that they ALL belong on here, but I wish this segment would been shown in its entirety:
- WWE Raw - 9/15/1997 - Muncie, IN - Blaze of glory
As for non-wrestling segments, where is more of D-Generation X?  Where is the Bret Hart interview on Raw the night after WrestleMania 13?

1882476,5,B00009AV91,"Shawn Micheals, HBK, The showstoppa, whatever you want to call him is a legend in the wwe. I did not become a fan of Shawn Micheals until he returned to the wwe after a 4 year absence due to a back injury. I was very impressed by this legend and decided to pick up this DVD. And to say I was impressed by the Showstoppa. Here is the list of the matches:
1) the Rockers vs. Buddy Rose and Doug Summers
Not a very good match but awesome blood spots. 7/10
2)Ladder Match
vs Razor Ramon
This really showed Micheals as a high flyer. Impressive match even though Micheals does lose. 9/10
3)Ironman match
vs Bret Hart
The excellence of execution going one on one with the Showstoppa was a battle for the ages. This match showed a different side of Shawn Micheals as he really worked The Hitman on a mat based game. A extordinary match up by two of the greatest. 10/10
4)No holds bared
vs Diesel (Kevin Nash)
A great match that showed that HBK could brawl with anabody of any size. 8/10
5)vs Mankind
A classic confrontation from one of the toughest high flyers against one of the greatest Brawlers of all time. Mick Foley did a good job putting over Shawn as a tough brawler. 9/10
6)Hell In a Cell
vs The UnderTaker
One of the best matches I have ever seen. HBK took some incredible bumps in this match. UnderTaker was ruthless in this match and never let up. With an assist from Kane, Micheals beat the Dead Man. 10/10
7)Street Fight
vs HHH
An incredible comeback for Shawn. He was incredible in this match, ladders, tables,and steel chairs all took part in this match. Both Micheals and HHH were beaten bloody, but the best man came out on top. 10/10

This collection is worth purchasing just for the 60 minute ""Iron Man"" match at Wrestlemania XII for the WWF title against the ""Hitman"" Bret Hart. This is perhaps the greatest match in WWF/WWE history as it truly gives a look at the athletic ability of Shawn and Bret as well.
Also included is the famous Ladder Match from Wrestlemania X for the WWF Intercontinental title when Shawn battled Razor Ramon. Kevin Nash's final WWF match as ""Big Daddy Cool"" Diesel from the April In Your House PPV when he battled Shawn for the WWF title in a no holds barred match. This was a good match, and one of Nash's best matches as Shawn was able to make him look good. The 9/96 ""Mind Games"" PPV title match with Mankind is here. Good solid match, but I've felt over time it has become a tad bit over-rated in my eyes. Hell in the Cell #1 is here in what was probably the best HIAC match that actually used wrestling as opposed to high risk bumps being the only stand out point (Mick vs Undertaker).
2 matches I was not impressed with was the AWA tag match with Marty Jannety and the ""Non-Sanctioned Comeback"" against Triple H at Summerslam 2002. These I felt were drab and could have been replaced with 2 matches I felt should have made the cut but did not for whatever reason. The first being Shawn's capturing of his first singles title when he defeated the ""British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith for the Intercontinental title in October of 1992. Also  the WWF title match from the 1992 Survivor Series when Bret and Shawn met for the first time for the title. Unlike 1997 the match finished cleanly and without debate as Bret walked out of the Richfield Coliseum with the WWF title and his pride. ;) It was a good match that I felt showcased the ability of Shawn in the ring when he was a young man.
With those  gripes aside, this is an excellent DVD set to pick up and is well worth the money as it gives an all around look at Shawn's career through the WWF during the 1990s. I rated this 4 out of 5 because I felt the two mentioned matches should have been included without thought.",1080604800,,2211,4.364077669902913
1882479,5,B00009AV91,"Shawn Michaels, the HeartBreak Kid, The Show Stopper, The Main Event, one of the greatest of all time (next to Ric Flair and Bret Hart). This DVD set is EXCELLENT, one of the best the WWE has to offer, next to Ric Flair's DVD set. Here's my review:
Disc One
the AWA tag team match (I don't know why this match was included, it's not classic and I doubt if anyone who watched the AWA back then even remembers this, give it a look ONLY if you've never seen it, otherwise, don't bother, because the TRUE CLASSIC material is after this match)**
vs. Razor Ramon, Wrestlemania X, Ladder Match (I had the pleasure of seeing this match on PPV and it was FANTASTIC, one of the greatest matches EVER that set the standard for ALL preceding ladder matches)*****
vs. Bret Hart, IronMan Match, Wrestlemania XII (this one was great because of both mens' wrestling acumen and the storyline of the match, even though it's one hour, it's entertaining, but if you don't have the patience to sit through an hour long match, skip to the last few minutes, but otherwise, this match is recommended viewing) ****3/4
Disc Two
vs. Diesel, Good Friends, Better Enemies 96 (Nash's best match ever, with a good friend no less, but the action here is just awesome, who said that ol HBK couldn't beat a man larger than him?)****3/4
vs. Mankind, Mind Games (oh man, this one was crazy, but at the same time excellent, they tore the house up this night)*****
vs. Undertaker, Hell In A Cell, Badd Blood 97 (the very first Hell In A Cell match is one to be remembered, even though Kane's involvement ruined the finish, this was one of the most unbelievable matches I've ever witnessed)****3/4
vs. HHH, Summerslam 2002 (after four years, it's amazing that HBK can come back and work one hell of a match, this match is great and gave HHH the best match he had since his match with Steve Austin at No Way Out 2001)****1/2
Check out the extra features as well.
Overall, this recommended to any wrestling fan. It's worth your time AND money. (However, the only thing this DVD set is missing is the Ladder Match part 2 against Razor Ramon.)",1079308800,,2100,4.54353562005277
1882490,5,B00009AV91,"I do hope there will be more From The Vault DVDs featuring different superstars. What we have here is a collection of some of the greatest pro wrestling matches of all time. Featuring arguably the greatest superstar of all time Shawn Michaels. Now I know some of you will complain that it is missing some matches or it doesn't focus on certain historical elements like The Rockers or the DX era and so on and so on. This isn't a biography it's a collection of matches hand picked by Shawn Michaels himself. Full length.
All the matches (save the first one) are at least 4 1/2 to 5 star classics. The Wrestlemania X ladder match. The Wrestlemania XII Iron Man Match. In Your House versus Diesel. In Your House Mind Games versus Mankind.
This recent batch of WWE dvds are phenomenal. I recently picked up The Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Mick Foley ones. Great buys featuring great matches. Now lets hope for a Bret Hart and Randy Savage collection",1079136000,,940,4.568047337278107

1. The Midnight Rockers Vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers - Wha tha? You would think with all the great matches the Rockers had (against Hart Foundation, Brain Busters, each other..etc..) that one would be here. Instead we get an early AWA match of no note. C'mon this is a Best of comp... **
2. Shawn Michaels Vs. Razor Ramon - Ladder Match WM X - I remember being upset at seeing a gimmick match like this for the IC-match at WM. Luckily I was wrong as this may be the greatest Ladder match of all time with Shawn stealing the show with jaw-dropping bumps off the ladder. *****
3. Shawn Michaels Vs. Bret Hart - Iron-Man match at WM XII - Match where the person with the most pinfalls win after 60min elapses. Great ending! ****1/2
4. Shawn Michaels Vs. Diesel - No DQ match - I thought their WM was better, but this ones pretty good, 1st WWF ""Hardcore match"" (using anything around the ring to beat each other up). Vince tells Shawn to stay down, but Shawn won't quit! ****
5. Shawn Michaels Vs. Mankind - The aerial, exciting Michaels takes on the unpredictable, crazy Mankind with both wrestlers adapting to each others style mid-match. Great match! *****
6. Shawn Michaels Vs. The Undertaker - Hell In the Cell I - Great cage match with Shawn taking one of the worst beatings I've ever seen, himself causing most of it with his crazy bumping. *****
7. Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple-H - No DQ - After 4 yrs. Shawn takes on Triple-H in a no-hold-barred match. Incredibly he hadn't lost a step! ****1/2
-For what it has this is a 5 star DVD and a great does a great job spanning HBK's career (except for his tag-team era). I could think of a dozen more matches that should've made it (C'mon its 2 DVD's!) but what's here is great!",1078704000,,1984,4.423497267759563

1882493,4,B00009AV91,"These are for the most part HBK's greatest matches(with the exception of the 1993 vs Marty)  The reason it only gets 4 stars is that if you already have the matches on the tapes of the various PPVs the extra's aren't worth it and the picture quality is not amazingly better like it is in the Flair DVD.  HBK blatantly lies in his comments about the ladder match saying it was the first in WWF history.  He had one with Bret Hart in 1992, you can see it on the tape Smack'em Whack'em.  That being said the Ladder match vs Razor is probably the best match in WWF history, and the rest of the matches on this DVD are between 4 and 5 stars.",1076371200,,636,4.104838709677419
1882494,4,B00009AV91,"Finally we have greatness to savor forever in DVD!This compilation is indeed riveting, as it features many of Michaels best matches in his career--from a bloodbath for the AWA Tag Team Championship to his donnybrook with Triple H at Summerslam 2002. All the matches are in their entirety, with Shawn himself introducing each via a short vignette before it. The 2 disc set contains the following matches in this order:
  Disc 1
  *9-2-86 AWA Tag Team Championship: Midnight Rockers vs Buddy Rose and Doug Summers

There are also NUMEROUS extras including promos, match buildups and the like and all of these matches are at least 4 and a half star, if not FIVE star matches. I said though that this DVD was not quite perfect and here is the reason: what few omissions were made are GLARING in their absence. For instance, there is no feature or even an extra on the split of the Rockers, which was a turning point in Shawn's career. Jannety and Michaels had many high quality matches, and none of them are featured here--and neither is most of Michaels work as a heel which was some of his best. He also had some classic title matches that were left out, including his victory over Jeff Jarrett for the I-C title at In Your House 2, his WWF title defense against Davey Boy Smith at King of the Ring 1996, the second ladder match with Razor Ramon at Summerslam 1995, not to mention his victory in the first ever Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series 2002 for the World Heavyweight Championship. They should also have included the match from Wrestlemania 19 against Chris Jericho and perhaps the biggest omission to me is the lack of a feature allowing Shawn to give his comments and perspective on the now infamous Survior Series screwjob in Montreal in 1997, as well as the rambunctious DX tactics that followed.
All in all, this is a classic and must own DVD for any wrestling fan and especially any Shawn Michaels fan. It does have some omissions that might cause picky fans like myself to muse over, but it does not spoil or take away from how great this really is. Quality matches,great promos and interviews make this a must see. Fine work WWE!!",1073865600,,2622,4.878103837471783

My favorite match on the DVD is his iron man match at Wrestlemania XII, against Bret Hitman Hart.  Even though the match is slow at points, it's still a true classic.  It was the very first time Michaels won the WWF Title.  The Ladder Match and the Hell in a Cell match are also enjoyable.  These match types were firsts in the WWE.  Shawn is truly the leader of the company, dominating the 90's (even with his back injury) and today, with his 2003 Survivor Series match, and his match coming up with Batista at Armageddon.

I think it should have been a 3 discer just like the upcoming Ric Flair DVD. I was hoping they would include some classic DX moments and other rarer matches like Jeff Jarrett from IYH: 2, and a match from 1995 RAW vs. Owen Hart where Shawn gets knocked out. There was also a match that HBK had with Mankind on RAW or the awesome One Night Only Match vs. The British Bulldog, I could go on and on.

A WWE fan already knows about HBK and these matches, so I won't rehash them.
The only thing missing from this DVD (which by the way is great with the extra interviews and other stuff) was his 1995 Rumble victory (in which he was the first man in and the last man left) and his IC title match with Double J in 1995.  That would have made this a 5-star disc.
As it is, having the ladder match from WM X and the iron-man match from WM XII, the no-holds-barred match with Diesel all in their entirety is great.

He also had a great match with Flair back in 1992 who belongs, and how many great tag-team matches with the Brainbusters and the Hart Foundation ???

  This DVD shows 7 matches that made Shawn Michaels career what it is today. This DVD is also filled with extras such as: pre-match promos, events leading up to matches, after match brawls, and ads for the PPV in which the match was on. But it is definitely the matches that makes this DVD great.
AWA Tag-Team Championship Match-  In this match him in Marty Janetty team up to take on the AWA tag-team champs in a decent brawl that gets real bloody. This match is significant because it finally gets him noticed and he soon after heads to better days in the WWF. Nothing scientific about this match, mainly just punching and kicking, but a great brawl and a fun match to watch. ***
Ladder Match for IC Title- This match comes from WM X against Razor Ramon. Just about every wrestling fan knows about this match and knows how great it was. This match was one of the first of its kind and both comepetitors pulled out all the stops to match this match great. Sick bumps by both Shawn and Razor make it even that much better. A revolutionary match to lead the way for other great ladder matches and hardcore matches. This is definitely the best match on the DVD. No wonder it stole the show that night from Bret and Owens ***** classic. *****
60 Minute Iron Man Match- This WWF Heavyweight Championship match against Bret Hart comes from Wrestlemania XII. Many fans say this match is boring but they are the fans who don't appreciate true wrestling which is what this match was. Not as good as the Rock-HHH Iron man match but it was still decent.****
No Holds Barred Match- Shawn Michaels first PPV title defense since becoming champion and he goes up against Desiel who is on his way out. Great brawl as Shawn really gets a great match out of Diesel in what is Diesels only great match. *****
WWF Heavy Championship Match- This match comes  from IYH: Mind Games against  Mick Foley who is playing the character of Mankind. Foley calls this match the  finest  of his career in his book and it  probably would be if  not for the blotched ending. ****3/4
Hell in a Cell- In the first ever Hell in a Cell match HBK battles the Undertaker in a great brawl with some sick bumps by HBK. Once again, HBK carries a decent oppenent into a great match with a memorable but bad ending.*****
Unsanctioned Street fight- After 4 years of retirement, HBK is ready to step back into the ring again. This time he goes up against friend turned enemy, HHH. This is a decent brawl in which Shawn is trying to prove that he's still the Showstopper. Great match by HBK in his first match out of a 4 year retirement. ***3/4

This is the just non stop action from not only his best matches, but the best matches in the history of pro wrestling.

- AWA Tag Team Championship
An entertaining match. I'd say it's my least favorite out of the entire DVD, but still good. I like it because it eventually turns into a blood bath at the end, which was very uncharacteristic for the AWA at that time.
***1/4
- Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match vs. Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X
This match is way ahead of its time. It revolutionized the ladder match as we know it today. Michaels does some amazing maneuvers in this match-up. And I absolutely love the ending, because it was planned out and executed to PERFECTION.
****
- Iron Man Match vs. Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII
""The Greatest WM Match of All Time"". Nope, sorry. That would go to Rock/Austin from WM 17 or Austin/Bret Hart from WM 13. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. I was expecting a spectacular match, and instead got something mediocre. Granted it was a great match, but after all the hype, it just didn't live up for me. I'd watch it again though.
***1/2
- No-Holds-Barred Match vs. Big Daddy Cool Diesel
Fun match here. It's like most of the HBK vs. a giant matches. HBK gets his [rear] kicked the whole match, then comes back at the end and picks up the victory. This match marks such spots as the powerbomb through an announcer's table, the first time using a fire extinguisher as a weapon in the WWE, and a prosthetic leg (yeah, a prosthetic leg.) Alternate commentary from HBK and Nash along with The Coach is decent too.
***3/4
- WWE Championship Match vs. Mankind
My personal favorite on the entire DVD. Great psychology, execution, and timing. This is the best match of Mick's career, and certainly one of HBK's best too. The end is disappointing, but it's fine because they put on such a great match. There's some nice brawling here, and a good table spot. JR's commentary gets on my nerves though. ""Their backs may be broken! Bah GAWD!"" Shut up, old man. They fell five feet through an inch-thick table. Yeesh. Other than that, I loved it. Possibly in the top 3 of my favorite matches of all time.
****1/2
- Hell in a Cell vs. Undertaker
The debut of the HITC. WWE gives you a nice treat at the beginning where HBK talks about the match and what it meant to him (he does that with all the matches, btw) when they show lots of footage from HBK/HHH/Chyna as DX. That stuff is hilarious. But onto the match. I'd say this is my favorite HITC match of all time. They did everything you're supposed to do. Both men take a good beating, then as a ref opens the door to help a camera man who had his clocked cleaned by Michaels, Michaels himself tries to escape Taker. Both end up on top of the cage, and HBK takes the worst possible way down. Debut of Kane sort of ruins the feeling that this match was all about Michaels-Taker because he comes in, Tombstones Taker, and leaves as HBK picks up the victory. Still a great battle.
****
- Shawn's comeback Non-Sanctioned Match vs. Triple H at SummerSlam 2002
It's weird watching this match, and comparing it to what you just saw before he had injured his back. It really pales in comparison to his earlier work, even though at the time this match was amazing. HBK put up a great effort though with some nice spots, and entertaining the fans. I do compliment JR on his commentary after the end where HHH has just taken out Michaels with a sledgehammer to the back. Not as good as the others on the DVD, but better than what they pulled at Armageddon later that year.
***1/2
The special features are fantastic. Each match has its own section of special features. HBK/Diesel had alternate commentary by the two of them with The Coach, which was cool. Each match has interviews/promos/TV spots leading up to the match. This is good because those of us who didn't watch the WWF back then didn't necessarily know the storyline behind the matches.
GREAT job here by the WWE. This is my favorite DVD they've put out so far. I'm not even really that big of an HBK fan and I still thurougly enjoyed this. I'll definately be re-watching the matches over and over.

It contains seven full-length matches & a lot of extras. It even contains four easter eggs, or hidden extras. Here's a full list of the matches, each with a star rating.
AWA Tag Team Championship match
The Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Summers: This was actually a pretty good tag team matchup, with plenty of great effort from both teams. The heated tension in this match continues to build up and finally turns into an all-out brawl between the two teams! While not match of the year candidate, this match still deserves a good bit of credit. ***
Intercontinental Championship Ladder match
Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramond: This was a very exciting ladder match. Both men worked hard & put forth a lot of effort just to make this match a classic. And by all means, they succeeded. This is not my favorite ladder match ever because I have seen better, but it sure is historical. ****
WWE Championship Iron Man match
Shawn Michaels vs. Bret 'The Hitman' Hart: Now this is match of the year candidate, folks! This is what professional wrestling is all about. With tons of great submission holds, awesome aerial and technical wrestling tactics, and tremendous athletisicm, you can't get any better than this. *****
No Holds Barred match
Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel: This matchup was quite interesting, with plenty of clean hardcore action and brutality. There was surprisingly NO blood in this physical battle, although it was still pretty violent, especially the part where Diesel powerbombs HBK through the announce table.  ***1/4
WWE Championship match
Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind: I agree with Mick. This was definetly the best match of his career, with great psychology, great timing, and tremendous athletisicm. However, the stupid DQ at the end of the match is the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. ****1/2
Hell In a Cell match
Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker: This was the very first Hell In a Cell match, and it kicks @$$. HBK recieves perhaps the worst beating of his wrestling career. Kane also makes his debut in this bloody matchup. *****
Non-Sanctioned match
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: This classic match from Summerslam 2002 is absolutely amazing. Infact, this was HBK's memorable comeback match. HBK and Triple H beat the heck out of each other, using various weapons such as garbage cans, a sledgehammer, a ladder, a table, steel chairs, and a leather belt. *****

And in closing i will say this DVD is the best release by the WWE yet.",1058572800,,437,3.909090909090909
1882522,5,B00009AV91,"I love the DVD set. Shawn Michaels is my all-time favorite pro wrestler and he has inspired me to do things I want to do. I do have one problem with the DVD. On the second disc, when you access the hidden clip of the ""I've lost my smile"" speech, they got the location wrong. The date is right. It was on Thursday, February 13, 1997 for a special Thursday Raw Thursday but it was NOT at the Manhattan Center. It was at the Lowell Memorial Auditorium in Lowell, Massachusetts. I was there so I should know. They also cut out the begining and end and only showed the speech itself. I was a little disapointed since on the original broadcast I was seen when he went around the ring after he finished the interview. Other than that it's perfect. That's the only mistake I found and the only problem I had with it. It's full of stuff that will keep you entertained again and again. I can only say BUY IT!",1058140800,2,898,4.226744186046512
1882523,5,B00009AV91,"This was not the DVD that I expected.  As a fan of Shawn Michaels, I was very happy when I heard that WWE was releasing a DVD set for HBK.  I expected that this one would follow the pattern of the other wrestler DVDs where there would be a feature running 60-90 minutes and some bonus matches and promos.  This one did not fit the pattern.  First off, there is no feature.  We do not get Shawn talking about his career and life (which means the segment I was hoping for: Shawn talking about his coming to Christ would not be included).  Since there is no feature, this also means that we don't see Shawn's career.  I hoped for more with the Rockers, more on his run with D-X and just more of his career as a whole.  Instead, this is almost a highlights DVD.
There are 7 matches.  Shawn gives an introduction to each, some longer than others.  It is nice to see Shawn talk about some of his most famous matches.  In addition, as extras, there are a whole slew of promos and interview segments during various eras of his career.  Most of these deal with the matches on the disc, but some are the important points of his career.  We see the incident at the Barber Shop where Shawn throws Marty Jannetty through a window and breaks up the Rockers.  We see (as an Easter Egg) Shawn give the ""I lost my smile"" speech.  We see promos leading up to the Iron Man and Ladder matches.  We also get the segment from ""Before They Were Superstars 2"".
1. AWA Tag Team Championship.  Shawn and Marty were the Midnight Rockers at the time in the AWA.  This match is slower paced, but turned into what has been described as a ""blood fest"".  Both Shawn and Marty wear the ""Crimson Mask"" by the time the match ends.  Not a great match, but it is nice to see some early work by Shawn.
2. Ladder Match: Wrestlemania X.  This match was to unify the Intercontinental Championship.  For some reason, Shawn had walked off the job for a while (not sure if this was a work or not) and Razor Ramon became the IC champ.  Shawn came back with his own title and feuded with Razor.  This was one of the first ladder matches in the WWF and set the standard for what would make the careers of The Hardy Boyz and Edge/Christian.  This match still holds up as being an interesting, exciting, and all around good match.
3. Iron Man Match: Wrestlemania XII.  This match was for the WWF Championship.  Bret Hart was the champion and Shawn the hungry young challenger.  At this point Bret and Shawn had a pretty good relationship in real life (which would later deteriorate), so this seemed to be a Face Vs Face match.  Shawn was known as a high flyer but not yet a mat wrestler.  This 1 hour Iron Man match showed that Shawn could go in a technical setting and for a match that lasted an hour, this was a great match.  I can see how some people can find the slower pace boring, but in my opinion, this is the bar that any Iron Man match needs to reach.  Great match!
4. No Holds Barred: In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies.  This was the last match Diesel wrestled in the WWF (excepting perhaps a house show where the Kliq incident happened which resulted in HHH being depushed at King of the Ring) before jumping to WCW.  This was the first No Holds Barred match in some time and is the precursor to what would become the Hardcore division.  I haven't watched many Kevin Nash matches, but this is a good all around match.  This also features an alternate commentary by Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash (they are not in character for the commentary).
5. WWE Championship Match: Mind Games.  Mick Foley holds this match up as the greatest he has ever been in.  This is a very good match and we have seen Michaels wrestle different styles before and this is another test as Mankind has a very rough style for HBK to wrestle with.  They turn in a classic for both wrestlers and this is all together an excellent match.
6. Hell in a Cell: Bad Blood.  This was the very first Hell in a Cell match.  Once again, HBK gets the call to innovate a new match for the WWF.  Once again, HBK lays down a classic match that is one of the best I've seen.  This sets the stage for all the violence and big bumps that HIAC is known for.  This match is against the Undertaker and also features the debut of Kane.
7. Unsanctioned Streetfight: Summerslam.  This is HBK's return match after 4+ years out of the ring.  HBK had to retire because of a bad back (he has several discs fused) and I watched this match grimacing with every bump Shawn took hoping that it wouldn't be his last.  HBK and HHH exceeded every expectation with the performance that Shawn was able to pull out and this was surely a contender for Match of the Year.
Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD.  I would have liked more matches (the feud with Jannetty, some more with the Rockers, DX, etc) and a feature on his career, but this is an excellent DVD for any HBK fan.  The only drawback is that several matches are on other DVDs (Mind Games, HIAC, Summerslam) that i own.  Like i said, a great DVD for a fan of HBK.",1058140800,3,5033,4.296493092454836

AWA Tag Team Championship: Ok match, pretty brutal.  **
IC Championship Ladder Match from Wrestlemania X vs Razor Ramon.
This is the match that made history and the careers for many superstars such as the Hardyz.  This match is great and pull off great moves for the first ever ladder match.  *****
Iron Man Match at WM12 vs. Bret Hart.  Most people consider this ""the greatest match of all time"" or somethin like that, but this match is real boring.  About 50 minutes of the match is the same two submissions on each other, but it gets exciting every once in a while.  HBK wins the title. ***
No-Holds-Barred vs. Diesel.  This was a pretty intense match, and possibly Diesel's best match.  ***1/2
WWE Championship vs. Mankind.  Nuff said, you know this will be good, and it was.  ****
Hell In A Cell vs. Undertaker.  Slow at the beginning, a few good moves here and there, but starts getting real good in the end, and Kane makes his debut there.  ****
Shawn's Comeback match vs. Triple H from Summerslam 02.  Everyone has heard about this match, saying it stole the show, and it did.  I bought Summerslam 02 mainly for that match, and now I can watch it on here.  HBK proved he ""still had it"" with some amazing moves in this match, including a body splash thru a table on Triple H.  *****
Three hours worth of bonus footage.  Trust me, if you're gonna buy the From The Vault HBK home video, buy it for DVD, it has plenty of extras.  I don't regret buying this DVD at all, it was worth every penny.",1057622400,,1633,4.362126245847176

1882530,5,B00009AV91,"I have been a die-hard wrestling fan, as far back as I can remember, 16 years to be exact, and I would be lying to you if I did not say that Shawn Michaels stands out as one of my favorite wrestlers of all time. However, it wasn't until Shawn left wrestling indefinitely after his WrestleMania XIV WWF Championship Match with Stone Cold Steve Austin, that I fully appreciated Shawn's charisma, talent, and performances. Shawn is the complete package: a high-flying mat-savvy luchador-styled wrestling talent, jam-packed with superstar looks and the undeniable charisma to boot. Thankfully, HBK has returned to the WWE, to finish his career on his terms and furthermore, I'm thankful the WWE released this anthology of Shawn's greatest matches. ""From The Vault"" features seven full-length matches, commentary from the ""Showstoppa"" himself, and various extras. Here's a rundown of the featured matches:
1. AWA Tag Team Championship- The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Janetty) vs. Buddy Rose and Doug Somers: A rare look at Shawn's roots in the tag team echelon of wrestling, paired off with Marty Janetty, forming one of the WWF/E's most legendary tag teams: The Rockers. As for the match itself, it's your typical 80's/early 90's match: methodical, but slow-paced by today's standards. Worth a look. 3/5.
2. Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon: As most seasoned WWE fans know, this is Shawn's stepping stone to superstardom and what better place to make a name for yourself than at WrestleMania X, at Madison Square Garden? It is because of this outing that Shawn is attributed with being the innovator of the ladder match, since there hasn't been a gimmick match such as this in the wrestling industry prior to this. Not much in the way of hardcore spots which the latter TLC matches exhibit, HBK utilizes great ring psychology to set the bar high for latter participants of this gimmick match. 5/5.
3. 60 Minute Iron Man Match for the WWF Championship- Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart vs. Shawn Michaels: In my opinion, this is HBK's greatest match ever, not just because of his outstanding high-flying dynamic performance and his WrestleMania title victory, but because of his opponent, one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all-time, Bret Hart. Tremendous and intense ring psychology, with the undermined personal feud attached to it. Obviously, this title fight can be exhaustive, even for the veteran technical mark, but completely satisfying by the end. Like the ladder match, HBK is the innovator of the Iron Man match. 5/5.
4. No Holds Barred Match for the WWF Championship - Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel/Kevin Nash: Shawn's very first title defense against his old friend, Big Daddy Cool. You would dig this match if you're more of a brawler-styled match mark, with some pretty good spots. 3/5.
5. WWF Championship - Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind. Solid match with the hardcore legend Mick Foley in his Mankind gimmick as Michaels' counterpart. Again, it's somewhat of a brawler-type match with some nice hardcore spots (i.e. Mankind's superplex to Michaels through the announcing table). 4/5.
6. Hell in a Cell Match for the WWF Championship - Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker. Mankind and by the time he hangs it up, The Undertaker, will go down as the kings of the Hell in a Cell, but it was Shawn Michaels who put a stamp on the legacy of the Hell in a Cell. As to be expected, this HIAC match is a brutal bloodbath. Shawn takes a sick bump, falling off the top of the cell and through the announcing table, one that Foley is notoriously remembered for in his first HIAC match. It is this title bout that started and forced him to give up wrestling several months later, at WrestleMania. Kane makes his momentous debut during the match. 5/5.
7. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: HBK's return match at Summerslam 2002 and Shawn had shown no ring rust at all after recovering from his near career-ending back injury. Awesome fight. 5/5.
If that wasn't awesome enough, ""From The Vault"" features three hours of extra footage, including promos and TV spots. My only complaint about this DVD set is that it should have featured one more match at Shawn's prime in his Rockers days, Shawn's first IC title victory over British Bulldog at Saturday Night Main Event, and Shawn's championship match with Austin from WM XIV. Aside from that, this set is highly recommended for the WWE newbie to the die-hard HBK fans. I also recommend ECW's The Best of Cactus Jack.",1057363200,,4514,4.91743119266055
1882538,5,B00009AV91,"Hey Yo!
If there is only one DVD you get this year, make it From the Vault with Shawn Micheals! This DVD has all the great matches in their entirety icluding entrances and aftermath. Each match is chock full of extras!
Heres the breakdown:
AWA Tag Team Championship:
The Rockers vs. Play Boy and Pretty Boy
Ok match. Things got a little brutal to the point of ending in DQ.
Wrestlemania 10 Ladder Match for Intercontinental Title:
Razor Ramon (Scott Hall) vs. HBK
Great match! The first ladder match set the standards for how the match works.
Wrestlemania 12 60-minute Iron Man Match for WWE Title:
Bret Hart (champ) vs. HBK
Settle in, this is a long one. In some moments it's slow but after awhile it gets exciting. The first time HBK won the title.
No Holds Barred Match for WWE Title at ""Good Friends, Better Enimies"":
Big Daddy Cool Diesel (Kevin Nash) vs. HBK (champ)
Kevin's last match in WWE before going to WCW. Very fast paced. Kevin even removed a prosthetic leg from a former wrestler in
the audience! HBK wins with the Sweet Chin Music.
WWE Title Match at ""Mind Games"":
Mankind (Mick Foley) vs. HBK (champ)
When you get the Hardcore Legend against the Showstopper, you know you're in for a classic! Big backdrop through table was insane! Match ends in DQ after interference by Vader, Sid, and Undertaker. Shawn retains title.
Hell in a Cell Match at ""Badd Blood"":
Undertaker vs. HBK
The first HIAC match ever! Just plain sick! The match that put a toll on Shawn's back. Also, Kane's debut which pretty much gave HBK the win.
Unsanctioned Street Fight at Summerslam 2002:
Triple H vs. HBK
Simply amazing. Possibly the best match of 2002 next to Rock vs. Hogan. Match ends with HBK countering the Pedigree with a rollup for the win.
The DVD has this and loads of extras including promos, TV spots, unseen footage, history packages, post-match events, a look at Shawn's past, a music video, photo gallery from said matches, commentary from Shawn and Kevin Nash on the No Holds Barred match, and hidden easter eggs. Try to find them!
Above all, I give this DVD not 5, but 10 stars. They should've named this ""The Essential Shawn Michaels."" I hope to see more of the ""From the Vault"" series with icons like Ric Flair, Bret Hart, or anybody else who has achieved the title of ""MAIN EVENT""

1882540,5,B00009AV91,"I am a fairly recent wrestling fan, from mid 98 onwards, so i hadn't seen much of Shawn Michaels, apart from when he returned as a non-wrestler, and i had seen some matches. I knew that HBK, Shawn Michaels was one of the best, but i never really knew just how gifted, charasmatic and how willing he was to sacrifice his body. On the DVD he wrestled against Bret Hart, and he showed how he can be one of the best technical wrestlers today, he wrestled in a ladder match, it showed how innovative, athletic and gutsy he is, he wrestled Deisel, it showed he can work great matches with big guys, he wrestled Mankind, it showed how well he could brawl, and how well he can adapt to a different style, he faced Undertaker in HIAC, it showed he has big, BIG balls, and how much curage and bravery he has, he wrestled HHH, and that showed how well he can comeback, after carreer ending back surgery, and have the match of the year, and it also showed he could wrestle a harcore style match. Man this guy can do it all. When you throw in many promos and even the ""Before they were superstars 2"" bit on Shawn in, this becomes a must have, not just for any HBK fan, but for any diehard wrestling fan. I have now seen enough, from these matches to tell you that he is one of the best wrestlers of all time. Maybe a few extra matches might have been really good, he deserves atleast 3 discs, because there are many matches i've seen of him that deserve to be on it, and there would be plenty more I haven't seen.
I just can't stop watching it, I'm gonna watch it again now so I'm gonna finish writing this...
BUY THIS DVD NOW.... DO IT!!!",1057104000,2,1626,4.198083067092652
1882541,5,B00009AV91,"When I first saw this DVD for sale, I was concerned because I knew it wouldn't be a biography chronicle of his career, like they have released before.  Instead this DVD resembles the HHH release ""That Damn Good,"" where it has full-length matches and a promo before each match.
Where ""From the Vault"" truly succeeds is in the extras included that hype the matches.  It's one thing to have the Hell in a Cell match, and it's another thing to have the build for that match.  Ditto for the Iron Man match, which has the best extras included.
As a die-hard Shawn Michaels fan, I was disappointed in the selection of matches, especially since I bought the Mankind DVD and Undertaker DVD for two of the matches included here.  But for ""From the Vault"" to work, it had to focus on the most revolutionary matches of that individual, and you couldn't release this package without including Hell in a Cell, the Iron-Man match, and the Ladder match.
All in all, I was more impressed by the compliation than I expected to be and I am EAGERLY anticipating further ""From the Vault"" releases for other SuperStars, especially Ric Flair.",1056672000,,1119,4.636363636363637
1882542,5,B00009AV91,"When I first heard that this DVD was coming out, I thought it would be so awesome that finnally the WWE would pay homage to one of its greatest wrestlers ever, one of the innovators of today's wrestling styles. But then, when I read the list of matches to be included, my hopes fell a little bit, firstly because of the LACK of matches,  and secondly because of the choice of matches. Here's the lineup for the DVD as it stands:
-AWA Tag Team Championship
-IC Title Match w/Ramon at WM X
-Ironman v. Bret Hart, WWF Title, WM XII
-1st ever title defense, Diesel, IYH
-Mankind, WWF Title, IYH
-Taker, HIAC, IYH
-HHH, comeback match, SS
Now thats all great, but I think that if they include one match, such as Ramon's at WM, then they should include the ""next chapter"" of that match, like their Summerslam rematch where it is Shawn who walks out victorious. Also, why not add the two Sid matches, his two matches agaisnt Austin (KOTR 97 and WM 14), and all 3 of his undertaker matches (IYH: ground zero, bad Blood, and Royal Rumble 98?). Those are just a few matches they could have justified, but hopefully they'll make up for that with the extra's DVD. If they show HBK matches, they had better show some of HBK's promos, which are half the reason why he was such a success- in the ring and on the mic. I'm still excited to see this DVD out, and when the first chance comes by, I'm going to grap it.",1056499200,,1398,4.315589353612167

Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel (Kevin Nash)-No Holds Barred..Nash chokes the ... out of Shawn with the ref;s belt...and powerbombs shawn through a table...very rare for the time.  This was at Good Friends,  Better Enimies-April 1996.
Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind-A good match..ended in Disqualification when Mankind suplexed Shawn from the top turnbuckle through the announce table. From Mind Games-August 1996
Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker-Hell in a CEll.  A VERY bloody match..Taker dominated the match..Shawn hit the Sweet Chin Music but Taker got right back up.  They fought ontop of the cell, where Shawn fell off the cell through the table.  Then, Undertaker was going to go for the Tombstone Piledriver...but Kane debuted  and ripped the  door off the cell..and Tombstoned 'Taker for Shawn to get the win.
Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H-Street Fight.  A brutal match..every thing from Tables to chairs to ladders to steel chairs were used.  The worst part was after Shawn had the win..Triple H hit him in the back with a sledgehammer twice.
WWE could have put the Casket Match vs. Undertaker from Royal Rumble 1998, where Shawn was backdropped on the casket and broke his back.  This DVD is worth EVERY Penny of the price.",1056067200,,1265,5.033653846153846

That is one of my favorite matches of all time, not just because its Michaels but because it was a 5 star match IMO. Its a damn shame they didn't put it. Another one they should have added was Sid Vs Michaels from Survivor Series and what about Michaels Vs Austin from Wrestlemania 14, I thought that was a great match with a spectacular performance from michaels considering he had a career ending injury. Another one they should have added was HBK & Austin Vs Bulldog and Owen from RAW. This DVD doesnt offer anything I haven't already seen, its very good for the casual fan though.
Michaels Vs Ramon Ladder match: This match put Michaels on the map. 5 stars out of 5
Michaels Vs Diesel: Good friend better enemies. I actually liked this match better than Michaels Vs Ramon from WM so thats saying a lot. Great drama and Diesel's best match IMO. 5 stars for sure
Michaels Vs Mankind: Seen this match online with bad quality picture but I thought is was a hell of a match, hard to get into it though because of the bad quality. Heard great things about it. 4 stars
Michaels Vs Bret: The match starts off slow but then a mid way trough, it picks up. Its a very solid match though. 3 stars

7990419,5,B00009AV91,"This is a set I've had for some time and have now wanted to comment on.  Boy oh boy, this is truly a must have for any Shawn fan as it has 7 of Shawn's truly most remarkable matches that are still talked about to this day.  The first match up is an AWA match from 1986 known as the ""New Year's Eve Bloodbath.""  It has Shawn and Marty Jannetty the Midnight Rockers against Buddy Rose and Doug Somers.  This is a great tag match!  Shawn, in this match showed just how tough and good he could be as he bled buckets during the match.  Good match.  The next one is the IC title Ladder match with Shawn vs Razor Ramon at Wrestlemania X.  This is a very good match that single handily put Shawn on the map!  It is still one of the greatest performances that the industry has ever seen.  Gorilla Monsoon even stated that this was the best match he had ever seen.  This match was awesome and set the standard for others to follow.  Up next is the Iron Man match for the world title with Bret and Shawn at Wrestlemania XII.  This is quite possibly the best technicial match of the 1990's.  These guys just leave it all hanging out in the ring.  The match is hold for hold and move for move and one of the most exciting matches I have seen.  Simply put:  This may have been Shawn's finest hour.  Up next was the No Holds Barred match for the world title at In Your House Good Friends Better Enemies as Shawn took on Diesel.  This match was wild and out of control.  There are tables being used chairs and even an artifical leg used during the match.  This was a decent match but these two have had better like their Wrestlemania XI match.  Following that is the world title match at In Your House Mind Games between Shawn and Mankind.  Holy crap is this match freaking good.  I still say it was one of the most exciting title matches ever!  To me this is the match that made Shawn the ""showstopper.""  Mick has said that this match is either his favorite or 2nd favorite match in his career and after seeing it you can see why.  This match is good.  Up next is the first Hell in a Cell match with Shawn and the Undertaker.  This match to me is like watching a movie.  It starts slow and then builds and builds to a hell of a conclusion.  Much like the ladder match this one set the standard for the others to follow.  This match was off the chart good and bloody as hell as well.  This was one of the first times that we got to  see Shawn bleed in the WWE and boy did he!  Great match.  The last match is the return to action match he had at Summerslam 2002 when he took on Triple H in a non sanctioned match.  This match was very good as well.  After 4 years of retirement Shawn returns to the ring in all his glory!  This match does define what Shawn is:  ""The icon, the showstopper, the main event.""  Another 5 star match.  There are a ton of special features on this set as well that are worth the price of the DVD too.  All in all this is one very good DVD set.",1321488000,,2954,4.090909090909091
7990420,4,B00009AV91,This is a good DVD set covering Shawn Michaels.  My only regret is that WWE left out a lot of Marty Jannety and Shawn Michaels as the Rockers in the WWF.  Other than that it is awesome good fun.,1261180800,,194,3.948717948717949
7990421,5,B00009AV91,"This is a near perfect set of matches. Hart Michaels Iron man, one of the greatest of all time. Michaels Mankind is one of Mankind's greatest matches, Big Daddy Cool's greatest match, Undertakers best Hell in a Cell performance, and an incredible match with HHH.",1257638400,,262,4.844444444444444
