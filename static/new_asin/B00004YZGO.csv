It makes you smile, cry, and before you know it, you will be praising God in your home with this video.  The words of the songs just ministers to your soul, and express things you want to say to God. I just love it, it's definately my favorite.",989452800,4,329,4.046153846153846

1379464,5,B00004YZGO,"I enjoyed the C.D. so much that I ordered the video and am blessed every time I view it.  It is so powerful and anointing. You get a chance to see a personal side of this awesome man of God who is so talented.  Even though I am not a Marvin Winan fan I did enjoy their duet ""Who Would've Thought"".  My personal favorite is ""I'll Trust You Lord"" where Donnie puts everything into this song and ""Great Is Your Mercy"" where you get a chance to appreciate his background singers.  Pick up this video.  You will not be disappointed.",983664000,15,527,4.23
1379465,5,B00004YZGO,"After purchasing both the CD and video cassette, I eagerly awaited for the release of the live video.  After viewing the video, mere words cannot depict this supernatural worship experience.  The video begins with Donnie's tour of London.  The tour hit some of London's most famous sites.  The tour expressed an intimate view of Donnie's personality.  Following the tour, the concert begins.  I must say, with each selection the supernatural power of God deepens.  What a wonderful worship experience! His duo with Pastor Marvin Winans was one of my favorites.  It not only revealed their love of God, but displayed a sincere and close friendship.  The altar call at the end showed why one truly sings gospel music:  to express Christ's love and concern.  This is a must for your video library.  In fact, buy several copies and give as gifts!  You will not be disappointed.",977184000,21,873,4.897260273972603
1379466,1,B00004YZGO,"the cd was defective. i think amazon must have received a bad batch because all three copies would not read on my players,even though other cds played without a problem.  i am sure the music was excellent, the problem was just the actual merchandise.",1477958400,,250,4.681818181818182

1379486,5,B00004YZGO,"I have moments when I watch this over and over and over all in one day.  Pastor Donnie ministers to all!  He worships in good old fashion church style as well as delivers the gospel to other cultures in their languages.  My favorite is The Blood Medley (""I know it was the blood for me""), simply powerful.  Of course ""I Call You Faithful"" is popular and has great energy.  The video is high quality, very professional camera angles, great sound (esp in surround sound).  You will NOT skip a track on this one.  Be blessed, this is a keeper, would make a great gift (so you don't have to share yours *smile*).",1255824000,,608,4.375

1379490,5,B00004YZGO,"I enjoy Donnie McClurkin's voice and music. I had the soundtrack and was very happy to beable to see the concert, it made me feel like I was really their.  Thank You",1170979200,,165,4.15625
1379491,5,B00004YZGO,"It's hard to imagine that anyone with even an iota of religious faith and/or any appreciation of singing that combines emotive power, marvelous musicality, and the masterful use of an incredible, God-given voice would not absolutely love this DVD. It's also hard to say which is the more remarkable: McClurkin's exquisitely impassioned singing, or the tender, compassionate, pastoral presence that shines through his music.

My wife and I lost our original copy of this concert recording to the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina. It had been a mighty aid in keeping our spirits together after the destruction of our house in a fire five years previous, so after we recently moved back into the rebuilt house (again!), ending a year's hurricane-imposed exile, I repurchased it as a present for my wife on our wedding anniversary. When she unwrapped her gift (which also included several other gospel music DVDs and a CD), she held up this McClurkin recording, and said, ""I can't believe you got me this!"" It turned out that, only the day before, she'd gone online to order three copies of ""Live in London and More,"" to replace ours as well as those of her two sisters, who had also lost theirs to Katrina. It had become an almost constant presence in the DVD players of all three households in recent years, a comforting, uplifting musical and spiritual experience available at the touch of the ""Play"" button.

There's not a bad song on ""Live in London,"" but standouts for me include ""Just for Me,"" a reverent expression of gratitude for Jesus' sacrifice of himself on Calvary; the lively, island-flavored ""Caribbean Medley;"" and an energetic duet with Marvin Winans on ""Who Would've Thought."" The backing vocalists get a chance to showcase their considerable talents on ""Great Is Your Mercy,"" and the instrumental support is superb throughout.

To get the most out of this DVD, it helps to have your player connected to a sound system capable of reproducing the music (especially the bass frequencies) with a level of audio fidelity that can do it justice. However, although the word ""anointed"" is often overused, there's no denying that the hand of God has touched this man in a very special way, to a degree that I'm sure would come through even if played through ordinary TV speakers.

This DVD is a treat that you owe yourself, even if you don't have a religious bone in your body. But if that's the case, be forewarned that the combination of this music and the palpable faith that radiates from it just might make a dent in your skepticism.",1161561600,2,2546,4.845977011494253
1379492,5,B00004YZGO,"whao!!!, kudos to donnie maclurkin for that wonderful piece. honestly, it's a wonderful inspirational rendation. i just cannot stop listening to that album everytime. i bet you if eventually the tape got spoilt, i sure must get another one cos anytime i listen to it, it inspires my spirit man.

1379498,5,B00004YZGO,"Just a few months while watching the BET awards show I came across Donnie singing. Wondering who he was, Donnie suddenly received a reward for best gospel singer or song can't remember which of the two. But what drew my attention were the words Donnie spoke, clearly one noticed He didn't sing for people but for God. 'Live in London' is a must have for every Christian believer. Watching the video/DVD one begins to enter to the presence of the Most High God. Clearly the music is off the hook, the band and singers are truly amazing. But its the anoiting that is behind the music that dominates. How I wish to have been there that night of recording!!!",1051228800,11,654,4.504201680672269

1379500,5,B00004YZGO,"Without a doubt, Pastor Donnie McClurkin is in touch with God. He exudes the anointing. He is in my opinion a serious gospel singer. I would encourage him to treasure his testimony and anointing. It is PRICELESS. My children plays his tape ALL DAY LONG when they are not in daycare. They prefer his tape over Elmo. Ashley is 2.5 years old and Amber is 1.5 years old and they will scream if I don't put ""Donnie"" on (as they call him).

1379503,5,B00004YZGO,"Donnie's charisma along with a fantastic vocal backing group makes this video a must for gospel and non-gospel music lovers. I loved it because, one, the words and message is crystal clear from the performers. Secondly, the music and the musicians center their performance on God. In other words, they remove the focus on them as performers and place emphasis on the message. They deliver the message with such sincerity and power it is overwhelming.

It is 2 hours long but I still wanted more....like the part edited out at the end of ""We fall down"".  Also, he sang ""Stand"" during the concert but it wasn't on the video.  Nevertheless, I was standing up singing with the video for practically the entire time - it was wonderful to see what I had been hearing the last 2 months.  Now I'm anxious to see him live and see all the parts edited out.",991526400,7,552,4.018348623853211
