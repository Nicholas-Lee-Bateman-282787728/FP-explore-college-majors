3791877,5,B001TKJDNA,"Really is a good show.  After Ritter passes, David Spade saves the humor of the show and it takes a different direction than it did in Season 1 due to the light hearted humor and sensitivity of Ritter in Season 1; but after Ritter passes in episode 4, they give him a solid tribute and you really do feel the pain of the actors in the show.  Worth the buy, no doubt, especially if you like humorous family oriented shows.",1242691200,2,421,4.25
3791878,5,B001TKJDNA,"John Ritter passed away after only three episodes of season 2. The series proceeded with a two part episode in which his character, Paul Hennessy, also died. The episode is very sad but is a fitting tribute to the great John Ritter. One can see the tears are real, they're not really acting; A testament to just how well loved he was by his castmates and everyone he met. Afterwards, the Hennessy's once again go about the business of making people laugh. It isn't the same without John Ritter. But, the addition of James Garner and David Spade to the regulars Katey Sagal,(Cate), Kaley Cuoco,(Bridget), Amy Davidson,(Kerry), and Martin Spanjers,(Rory), helps to fill the void. As a fan, I highly recommend season 2.",1240876800,37,716,4.829268292682927

3791912,3,B001TKJDNA,"Season two is when the show excuse this saying ""grew a beard"".

John Ritter's untimely death greatly affected this show, putting it in a three week hiatus.
As a result of killing off Paul, Tracy Gamble and ABC brought in James Garner and David Spade and made sure Cate (Sagal) wasn't the only one who was taking care of the children. I am not saying season two is god-awful, I think it's on par with season one.

The characters have started to develop more, Bridget is more of a character than a stereotype, Kerry goes from a bitchy sarcastic redhead to a more nicer person, Rory goes from a tattling pain in the butt to an oddball child. Cate herself goes from the stereotypical working mother, to a mother who actually has time for her kids. James Garner is hilarious as Cate's father Jim Egan, a Korean war veteran who can be just like Paul (Ritter). Jim often butt heads with C.J. (played hilariously by David Spade) who is a wise-ass and a man child. Among this season you will see Jim often trying to swing at C.J. with his cane. The idea of adding Spade and Garner to the series was to give it a more comedic atmosphere compared to the long one hour dramatic episode where we learn Paul has died.

Now for the problems I have with the set
Video: 10/10
Audio: 10/10
Bonus: 0/10
My big issue with the bonus features being blank is we have no tributes to John Ritter and No Audio Commentary and not even a segment with David Spade or James Garner.

Final thought: The release is great if you want the show, but if you're looking for bonus features nope you will be disappointed. This set probably had terrible sales and that's probably why Lionsgate cancelled season three's DVD release.",1401235200,3,1691,4.4627831715210355
3791913,5,B001TKJDNA,I am glad there is a second season on DVD. To see even one episode of this show -- those episodes with John Ritter --- is to want to see more. There are so many family sit-coms out there. This is one of the very best in so many ways.,1391817600,,233,3.68
3791914,5,B001TKJDNA,"I loved this show when it was on TV.  I never missed an episode.  Even though John Ritter died early in the second season
(an untimely death), the show carried on.  The addition of James Garner as Kate's dad was terrific.  Later they added David
Spade as C.J. who was the nephew of Kate and grandson of Jim.  He was another great addition to the show.  The two men played well off of each other.  I thoroughly enjoyed the second season and will also buy Season Three if/when it  becomes available.",1388793600,,497,4.384615384615385
3791915,5,B001TKJDNA,We love Jim Ritter.  This show was great for the family.  We can watch this full season over and over.,1386720000,,102,4.05
3791916,5,B001TKJDNA,Loved this show....John Ritter was so much funnier in this series than he was in Three's Company.  Great characters too!  Such a tragedy to lose the talent of this great comedian so young.,1384905600,,188,4.666666666666667

3791919,5,B001TKJDNA,I love this series despite the tragic situation around this sitcom.  I cannot stop laughing.  A must have!  Get it.,1375660800,,115,4.65
3791920,4,B001TKJDNA,"If you love this tv series you cant go wrong with buying this dvd.
It is a classic series and its something you can keep forever.

3791921,4,B001TKJDNA,"The first couple of episodes, sadly John's last, are funny as ever.  The five after his passing are touching and a wonderful tribute to his comedic and acting talent.  The worst thing they did was to bring in David Spade.  Simply put, this was not his niche, and he just didn't belong in this series.  Otherwise, I love this season and the remaining cast.

I was great to see how everyone reacted to their husbands/fathers death.  Just like real life, everyone reacted differently.  Just like real life, there can be laughter among the tears.",1372723200,,542,4.702127659574468

3791923,5,B001TKJDNA,I recommend everyone see this show. All seasons! Case came in great shape and everything went smoothly. Very good show.,1362355200,2,119,5.0
3791924,5,B001TKJDNA,What can you say about a show that had an unfortunate change of events.  I think they handled it as well as they could of with adding David Spade and James Gardner to lighten the show up with the untimely loss of John Ritter.,1361750400,,225,4.113636363636363
3791925,5,B001TKJDNA,"Season 2 is another good one; it's packed with laughter, sadness, growing and changing, and some new people in the cast. John Ritter passed away after collapsing in the studio during a rehearsal for this season. He was apparently loved, and his death was added to the season, as was mourning and paying respects (it was worked into the plot). Kate's father (James Garner) ends up moving in after the passing of Paul (John Ritter), and he adds to it nicely. Kate's nephew, C.J. (David Spade) also joins the cast, and he can be funny, though his humor and role in these last seasons can be controversial. But this is a really good season, especially considering the loss of a main character in the series. Most series don't hold it together as well after losing a main character.

This, like the first season, is also in a decent box set and has separate places for each DVD.",1360022400,,873,4.560509554140127
3791926,5,B001TKJDNA,My husband bought this dvd for me because I loved this show. I was sad when John Ritter died but I can watch it whenever I want now.,1357344000,2,132,3.75
3791927,3,B001TKJDNA,"I really loved this show. Season one was incredible.  The chemistry built by the actors in this series was outstanding, and John Ritter nailed the tortured father in every respect.  His delivery always made me laugh out loud.  All the actors meshed perfectly.  Stories were funny, often touching.  Writing was great.  All the cast did a great job playing off of each other.  You could see a real bond and it came through in the show.

The passing of John Ritter was a great loss to show business overall, but was a death blow to the series.  I thought they did a fantastic job with the episodes dealing with his passing, was both funny and heartbreaking at the same time.  A very fitting tribute.  And the DVD is worth it just for the beginning of the season that had the episodes with John and the episodes that dealt with his death.  But unfortunately they weren't able to recover well.

James Garner was a good addition, did a enjoyable job of the father/grandfather trying to help bring a male presence to the family, but the addition of David Spade for me was the death knell.  I've never been impressed with his ""acting"" and it was not at all good here.  They spent too much time focusing on him, and the series suffered terribly for that.  It was no longer a great show, but became just another TV series.

But the first episodes in this season were as outstanding as the first season, and a great tribute to the talent that was John Ritter.",1341360000,7,1448,4.465648854961832
3791938,4,B001TKJDNA,"I enjoyed the first season of this show, but didn't have a whole lot of hope for the second season, as John Ritter had passed (RIP) and I'm not a huge fan of David Spade.  But the cast pulled together a decent season, and while I agree with the studio that it wasn't worth carrying farther than this, this season paid fitting tribute to John Ritter after his passing.  They didn't try to sneak in a replacement, rather acknowledged that he died, and showed a family dealing with the loss of their father figure intensely in the first part of the season, and intermittently throughout.  And David Spade didn't try to be more or less than he ever had before, just fit his expected persona, so it was dealable.",1316995200,,707,4.465116279069767
3791939,5,B001TKJDNA,"Unfortunately, John Ritter died this season, but David Spade and James Garner joined the already amazing cast. For anyone one who doesn't know, ""8 Simple Rules"" was one of those sitcoms from the early-2000's that was short-lived (3 Seasons, 76 episodes total), but was simply entertaining week after week. Reruns currently air on ABC Family, but to fully enjoy this show, you have to buy both the first and second seasons, so that the episodes are available in an endless supply. I only hope that the third season will find its way onto store shelves someday. Let's face it; two years between releases, and still nothing, can't be good! Every night that the show aired originally on ABC, I tuned in. This series still remains one of my favorites, and the episodes hold-up after multiple viewings. Especially this season, the series pulls on your heartstrings, while demonstrating that laughter is the best medicine. Please note, when viewing the ""Good-bye"" two part episode, have a box of tissues close by! Again, a show that only lasted three seasons, that can still spark my interest after years and years, has to be well done!",1315526400,,1129,4.885416666666667
3791940,5,B001TKJDNA,"For anyone with children, 8 simple rules is as accurate as it gets.  This is how kids twist their parents, using every technique available.  The re-direct, the bait and switch and the answer a question with an equal, and totally opposite question.  By the time Kate and Paul figure out what hit them, chaos has ensued.  And don't forget, ""the boy"".  Using every opportunity to ""drop"" hints at what his sisters are up to, Rory makes sure nothing gets past mom and dad.

Even with the loss of John Ritter, the arrival of James Garner as grandpa, and David Spade as C.J., make sure the hysterics continue.  But it was still cut way too short after only 3 seasons.",1290038400,,660,4.495798319327731
3791941,5,B001TKJDNA,"While not quite as funny as the first season, it was for the most part very enjoyable. A lot of ""touching"" moments too. Understandable, with the cast and writers dealing with the untimely death of family patriarch John Ritter, it had to be difficult trying to continue a comedy series.  A little less David Spade would have helped, in my opinion, but that's just me. Kaley Cuoco still just as hot as ever!",1269129600,,405,4.5479452054794525

3791944,4,B001TKJDNA,"8 Simple Rules is an excellent show, unfortunately this is the season where John Ritter passes away. There are essentially three different shows here, the one with John Ritter - that we all came to love, the one where the family (and us, really) deal with John Ritter/Paul's death, and the show after they move on - with James Garner & David Sapde. The show was different later on, but still a good show. James Garner was a brilliant addition of both comedy and heart, and nobody could have been a funnier addition than David Spade.

The DVD is OK. All episodes are uncut, but the introductions to John Ritter's final episodes are missing. There are no special features, which is disappointing.",1249689600,8,694,4.688524590163935
3791945,3,B001TKJDNA,"8 Simple Rules could've been a strong season if not for the untimely death of John Ritter in 2003. Ritter was the heart and backbone of this show and without him - this sitcom was never the same. Ritter is only in the first 3 episodes and it is sad to go back and watch, he was such a dynamic force. James Garner and David Spade were brought in to revamp the show, I like Garner - but dislike Spade (he's just not funny!). Ok season but the magic had diminished.",1248048000,5,462,4.087912087912088
3791946,5,B001TKJDNA,"John Ritter was one heck of an actor, and his death was too premature.  Rest in peace to a wonderful man, but his performances will live on forever.

The first season of ""8 Simple Rules"" makes it a fantastic family show, and with the second, I thought ABC would drop it because of John's death.

Much to my surprise, they incorporated John's death INTO the show, rather than just ending it.  Whether they thought the show could go on, or felt it was time for a sitcom/drama to present death in a real light, I don't know.  Except they did, kept a straight face, and re-tooled the show, and the excellence remains...

After a period of mourning, for which those episodes do not have a laugh track, they continued and brought in veteran actor James Garner, who proved to be an instant hit with the audience.  His presence adds a new chemistry, which clearly works.

Then they added David Space, a move that surprised me, who turns out a BRILLIANT performance to a cast that already had genuine chemistry -- a show that lost John, but rebounded with James and David.  It was thought out well and it showed.  Plus, the show being a 'family' show presented a topic that does happen in real life.  Big kudos.

This show is well-written and well-acted.  By all.  There is substance, depth, and wit that transcends what could have been sloppily-written, cornball comedy.  It's that wit that also helps to elevate what is already a great series.

My favorite episode from this season is a tie, between ""Get Real"" (David Spade's introduction where he's set up as being an irresponsible oaf), and ""Consequences"" (the very special drug use episode).  As with the season in general, those two episodes are very sharply written but stand out because they transcend ""typical"" sitcom moments.  No easy task.

Highly recommended to all, it's a shame ABC canceled this show after its third year (by placing it before a REALLY bad show on Friday nights), but that's another story...",1247356800,19,1963,4.703812316715543
3791947,4,B001TKJDNA,"First,I want to dedicate this item to the loving memory of the multi-talented Jonathan Southworth ""John"" Ritter(September 17,1948-September 11,2003). Ritter had completed filming the first three season 2 episodes of ABC's 8SR. He was working on the fourth episode when he suddenly collapsed on the set(suffering a massive heart attack) and was taken to Providence Medical Center,where he was born,across the street from the Burbank,CA studio. The 54-year-old television legend,remembered for his starring roles on ABC's THREE'S COMPANY and CBS's HEARTS AFIRE,died in the evening of 9/11/03,the very same day his and wife,fellow actress Amy Yasbeck's daughter Stella turned 5. Ritter was about a week shy of his 55th birthday and the couple's 4th wedding anniversary. In fact,Ritter was a day shy of Yasbeck's 41st birthday. Anyway,the newly widowed Cate Hennessy(MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN veteran Katey Sagal) rules the household and solely supports her and sportswriter Paul's(Ritter) three teenage children Bridget(Kaley Cuoco),Kerry""Care Bear""(Amy Davidson) and Rory(Martin Spanjers). It was written that Paul had dropped dead of a heart attack while shopping at a supermarket. He was supposed to come back in time that morning to drive the kids to school. Memorable guest appearances by James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette as Cate's parents,David Spade as Cate's nephew C.J.,Billy Bob Thornton,a longtime good friend of Ritter's who were castmates during the HA run, and CHEERS veteran John Ratzenberger.
