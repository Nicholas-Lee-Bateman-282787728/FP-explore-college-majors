7432572,5,B015CVRQ0I,This movie was awesome. It is a classic slasher movie. They don't make them like this anymore. Great cast and great plot.,1455235200,,121,4.545454545454546
7432573,4,B015CVRQ0I,"After watching this film, I had to go look it up. This is definitely an exploitation style slasher, but what I found intriguing about this film is that it actually has a good story coinciding with the kills, which goes against the norm of a typical slasher film. It has a 1970's style feel to it with the country Sheriff (he was good) reminiscing of Macon County Line or Walking Tall. That's not the only aspect that reminded me of 70's cinema, the other is it takes it's time developing and gradually picks up steam. I like that. There were some rough areas in the acting, but overall I expect that from a B-movie horror. My wife and I both felt the lead guy, Ned, (Eric F. Adams) was really good and so was one of the girls, Hope (Emilia Graves). The music score was surprisingly solid, but the sound (dialogue) was crummy in spots; I guess that's a direct result of the low budget. It also a psychedelic feel to it with bizarre flashback scenes which I did not understand, but then again, I never understood any of Italian horror.",1455235200,,1033,4.4136125654450264
7432574,4,B015CVRQ0I,"Usually I eject these micro budget horrors after about ten minutes, but I have to say that this film was quite entertaining.  There is some crazy lady in a bloody dress that is running around killing these hunters one by one. Im no hunter, but this film gives you a really interesting insight into the world of country hunting camp guys.  Some of the camp members pick up some cute girls in town and you know how that is going to end.  The acting was solid and the kills had an old school feel, no CGI, which I really liked.  I read where the budget was around $30,000, which is hard to imagine, but for such a small budget, they created a darn good horror flick.  Ill take this one over some million dollar films any day.",1455148800,,722,4.240875912408759
7432575,4,B015CVRQ0I,"Low key, and a bit of a slow-burner, IN THE HELL OF DIXIE overcomes early drag and a long running time once all is done playing out. I can find a couple reasons for this. For one thing, part of the extra running time and build-up goes toward more character interaction and background plot development than one is apt to expect from what is at heart a slasher picture. Plus, the low budget grit, creepy score and overall atmosphere lend this one a strong 70s/80s drive-in flavor. One feels like the movie is channeling a bit of Herb (Graduation Day) Freeds obscure small-town horror Haunts and a dose of S.F. Brownrigg (Dont Look in the Basement, Dont Open the Door). IN THE HELL OF DIXIE ends up being quietly compelling, despite a script needing more tightness and some rough acting. Of course, these are also the kinds of things that add to the feel of underground, minimalist horror.

Rural police politics intersects with a bunch of hunters out at the lodge in the small-town melodrama that comprises the backstory. This plotting in itself ends up being interesting; I found myself intrigued by how all the character clashes might end up playing out. Then, in the midst of this, a killer starts taking out members of the populace  mostly from the large-ish cast of core characters  and theres no immediately apparent motive. There is a back story that is slowly revealed by way of flashbacks; naturally, this will have something to do with the current killings.

The murderers identity is also a mystery. The psycho wears a dress, wields an axe and wears a sort of Mardis Gras domino mask. The pattern to who pisses off the killer  i.e., who ends up dead  is a matter of curiosity that keeps the viewer engaged. Loads of atmosphere and enough surprise and suspense goes a fair way toward overriding the rough edges.

Viewers who demand too much polish won't be blown away but those of us with an appreciation for raw but effective indie horror can get a kick out of it.",1455148800,,1973,4.636103151862464

8733155,1,B015CVRQ0I,"One of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Not only was the acting, script and continuity bad, the film was way to long and bad.",1495497600,,148,4.137931034482759
8733156,1,B015CVRQ0I,"This movie was stupid but the scenery was accurate. I think the actors fell flat as portraying those from Louisiana. The area where the movie was filmed, the people do not have the prominent ""Cajun accent"" but it would be Southern. These actors were very ""Yankee"" and not believable as Louisiana folks. The story just flopped and bounced too much...it tended to drag on in parts that the point was quite clear...edit this and then bring it back to Amazon Video....",1469318400,,464,4.7407407407407405

8733158,2,B015CVRQ0I,"This is a Louisiana slasher that was long winded and needed an editor. The film centers around Ned (Eric F. Adams) our protagonist who is both unlucky and not very likeable. There is a hunting lodge where guys hunt, look at pictures of racks (deer racks) and have sex with young females. There is a slasher on the loose, about half way through and we also trudge through a poorly done flashback birthday party with a guillotine and a bunch of kids.  The writer felt he needed to cram every corn-ball hillbilly phrase he could think of into one sentence. It needed to be thinned out, so the humor could be appreciated. I felt the film tried to do too much. Sometimes less is more.

8733162,1,B015CVRQ0I,"Just another no-budget video with no scares, lame acting and lousy sound. Aside from one cool song, this one's just another c-movie to throw on the heap.

The DVD artwork is pretty cool, which kind of suckered me in, and it has an 8.0/10 rating on IMDB, but I didn't check out who was actually rating it.

Trust me, it's just terrible.",1456185600,,335,4.387096774193548
