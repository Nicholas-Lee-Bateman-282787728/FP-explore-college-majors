8045941,5,B00078ZCMG,"Fantastic!  I absolutely LOVE the movie, so when I learned there was a concert also, I just HAD to have it too!  If you love jazz/swing, and/or watched the movie Swing Girls, this will surely be a concert you will likely enjoy.",1479772800,,227,4.380952380952381
8045942,3,B00078ZCMG,"I read the earlier reviews and had a pretty good idea about what to expect from this DVD (all Japanese/no English subtitles, Region 2 encryption, not many songs, etc.). These reviews were exactly right. However, one would expect that a 2-hour DVD might contain more music than speeches, but that's what is my main complaint is: too much (Japanese-only) talk. I don't speak a lick of Japanese, so I was left trying to guess to what is being said by the smiles. or tears. of the speakers. You often get 10 minutes between numbers, such are the speeches. The first half of the disk features the non-band music, performed by real musicians. The two guitarists are very good, and the ""pro musicians"" know their stuff, so you still get some good entertainment for your money.

Probably the funnest to watch are the parts where each girl band member is called up, and something is said about her, causing giggles and laughs. You can tell that some of the young ladies have developed reputations of being impish, particularly the drummer babe, Yukari Toyoshima. The star, Juri Ueno, comes across as serious most of the time, and does a lot of the talking. Clearly, she learned how to handle stardom during this time. She's more or less the MC during the show.

The movie is a full 16:9 full screen DVD, of very good quality (not the horrid compressed upload stuff you see on YouTube). Sound quality is very good. They clearly employed a lot of cameras filming the concert, with lots of fast cuts between them (which I hate viewing  makes me dizzy). It is definitely Region 2 encoded. I managed to break through the region encoding by using Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) and MacTheRipper, which then let you bypass the locks that 10.6 and above use to prevent MTR from eliminating region coding.

There are two DVDs in the set, Disk 1 being dual-layer (8GB, little-compression) and Disk 2 a single-layer disk (4GB). Disk 1 is the concert itself, Disk 2 being short interviews of each girl, all in Japanese.  Any doubts that the girls learned to play their instruments is erased when you see and hear them playing and practicing. They're not the greatest of players, but adequate for the job of playing 4 or 5 numbers before getting off the stage.  ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" is the best number they do; ""Take the A Train"" is probably the worst: someone is *very* off-key throughout the number, and I think it's the ""guest"" male sax guy who probably had no time to tune up his horn to the rest of the band. Just my guess, though.

The main reason I wanted to own the disks was to have a good quality recording of their version of Nat King Cole's L-O-V-E (which is the song played over the Swing Girls movie closing credits). The ensemble does a very happy rendition of it. It's one of those numbers that puts a smile on your face just watching the kids bounce around on stage and hearing a bunch of native-Japanese singing an English language song (and doing far better with their English than I do my Japanese!). The singing is pretty good, but note that's just because they have a bunch of trained singers in the background doing the heavy lifting. The girls are in front of mics, but thankfully their level is cranked down so their shrill voices don't spoil it too much! Towards the end of the number, Juri Ueno is almost screaming at the top of her lungs, off-key, adding to the hilarity.

I managed to buy the DVD used for under $20 so that even if it's not very good (and it isn't), I didn't feel burned. The vendor, Japan-based samurai_media_JPN4US, sent out the DVDs very quickly, too.",1377734400,3,3567,4.571205007824726
8045943,4,B00078ZCMG,"in 2004 a japanese film director made a film about a bunch of lazy,underachieving high school girls who had to replace the school band.the director put it about that the actresses had to learn to play the instruments in 5 months!! not true! of the 17 partisipants,12 learnt their music in school bands,,only 2 had no music knowledge at all  this 2 day concert was put on to prove that they did play the music in the film.",1368489600,2,421,4.397435897435898
8045944,5,B00078ZCMG,"Great music and a chance to see the actresses and their instruments in action for real.  Those girls (and a boy) really learnt to play and perform for the movie - hats off to them.  The final concert scene of the movie was apparently mimed (but to their own playing), but here you see them performing some hot swing live in front of an audience and they are good.  The sax section stands out particularly with some nice techniqie.  The trumpet section had its moments of crisis, (the agony on the face of the actress who just failed to hit her top note in 'Sing, Sing, Sing' broke my heart) but let's not forget these actresses are not professional jazz players and comparison should not be made - they all did really well and made a very happy sound.  The drummer is the coolest ever - star of the show.  If you don't speak Japanese (there is no English sub-title option), you should be prepared to do a lot of fast forwarding, there is quite a bit of talk (and tears from the girls) plus a considerable amount of music from the 'support' bands.  You get the feeling that making the movie was a fabulous experience for them all.  The extras disc is entertaining and shows the run up to the concert.  Money well spent for any 'Swing Girls' completist and anyone who likes swing.",1361232000,5,1278,4.404255319148936
8045945,2,B00078ZCMG,"I loved the Swing Girls movie and wanted to see their First and Last Concert. Unhappily, the DVD is recorded in an Asian Region format and will not play on either of our DVD players that are intended for the US Region. There was no indication in the description or packaging to indicate this and,because it was obviously intended for a US market, I had no reason to suspect a problem. I contacted the Japanese seller for a refund but told they wouldn't refund if the package was opened. How would one discover this problem without opening the package and trying to play the DVD? Unless you have a DVD player you know will handle other Regions - stay away from this product and the seller.",1350000000,4,688,4.468253968253968
