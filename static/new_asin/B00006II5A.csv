7969136,1,B00006II5A,"The quality is so poor that it is almost unwatchable.  If you liked Star Wars, you would have loved this ancient (born the same year I was) but intense and inspired adventure if only you could see it and understand it.  I have purchased other films from this company (such as A Walk In the Sun) and have been similarly astounded by the incredibly inept transfer.  These people have absolutely no respect for their product.",1073692800,6,422,4.6
7969137,1,B00006II5A,"Alpha Video occasionally makes a decent looking film-to-DVD transfer, but this isn't one of them. Pre-print herelooks like a 16mm dupe of the (retitled) tv reissue. The picture is contrasty and soft focus. The edges of the titles are clipped off which indicates that the picture is off center, and the audio is mushy. If you want this serial, I recommend you buy the Image release. It costs a little more, but it is superior in every way.",1045872000,6,438,4.628205128205129
7969138,3,B00006II5A,"I remember seeing these Flash Gordon movies when I was a kid, and was enthralled by the serials (as they were presented).  Each week, the show would end with Flash, Dr. Zarkof or Dale Arden in an inescapable death situation.... the next week, we'd see how they escaped.  The heros travel to Mars or Mongo to save the earth from the most wicked villan in the universe, Ming the Merciless, played by Charles Middelton.  Middelton was superb as Ming.... pure evil.  The special effects in the movie are outdated and laughable by today's standards, but were very impressive when they were created.  You certainly won't see Star Wars or Return of the Jedi here, but if you want to go back to a much earlier vintage space movie, or if you remember these from your youth, they'll be of value to you.",1042761600,3,792,4.549295774647887
