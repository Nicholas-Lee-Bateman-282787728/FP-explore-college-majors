8137664,2,B000H8RZL2,"I purchased this course as part of the 4 disc DVD set for over $200, thinking it would teach me something. Well, unfortunately, besides brushing up on some old fundamentals it disappointed me. Definitely not worth $200 in my opinion...but I will let you be the judge of that.

Further ""Dislikes"":

1. He ""mimes"" to try sync with his pre-recorded voice narration, without
  much success. Get's a bit irritating after a while (remember the old
  Eastern Kungfu movies?)
2. His mixture of English words does not go well with his strong foreign
  accent. This, at times, makes it difficult to follow what he is saying
  especially when he uses ""tech words"" that newbies won't have heard
  before.
3. He spends too much time explaining basic concepts, without getting
  into the the actual material enough.
4. The examples on screen are often cut off, which means you cannot follow
  what he is explaining as you cannot see the examples.
5. He, at times, makes mistakes at the command line, but does not always
  correct them, which leaves you guessing what is correct - unless you
  knew better yourself.

Having been through 3 of the 4 discs (couldn't push myself any further than disc 3), I gave up. Other CBT Unix / Linux training that I do recommend (over Boris' course) are those offered by CBT Nuggets and LinuxCBT. That and a few good Unix/Linux books will get you far more productive in the Unix/Linux World.

For those wanting a very ""Basic Intro"" into Unix, then stick with Boris.",1198886400,,1486,4.700389105058366
