8567401,5,B00BEZEH6S,"I was in Washington DC recently and visited the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian.  It was an unbelievable experience.  I bought this documentary there, but bought another on Amazon as a Christmas gift.  The story of it has all of the intrigue of a great mystery novel.  Buy it!",1379548800,,276,4.571428571428571
