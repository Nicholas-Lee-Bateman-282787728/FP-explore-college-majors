8582462,3,B0000A2ZQ5,"Taste the blood of Glenn McQuaid. With a subbass soundtrack provided by Scorn, Convulsion is a bit daft but apparently of note. The rest  of the flicks are ok too.",1098230400,,163,4.433333333333334
8582463,4,B0000A2ZQ5,"Bright young talent showcased in the context of modern horror.  DVD slams in with a visually intoxicating start - featuring director Glenn McQuaid's ""Convulsion.""  This is a really bizarre & interesting mix of sci-fi and horror a la Cronenberg meets Clive Barker.  In fact - hats off to all filmmaakers who patricipated in this wakcy compilation.",1081814400,,346,5.142857142857143
8582464,4,B0000A2ZQ5,"If you're looking for innovative horror shorts, this is the DVD for you.  If you're looking for talent to grab before they get famous, buy it and check'm out.",1081814400,,158,4.448275862068965
8582465,5,B0000A2ZQ5,"The DVD deffinately has some fun films but Silent Razor takes the cake. It's an homage to the Shaw Brothers, S/m, Samurai movies, and comic books all rolled up into one. If you like vinyl clad hotties and samurai wielding vigilantes, then this is for you.",1069286400,,255,4.565217391304348
8582466,4,B0000A2ZQ5,Do not miss this! This could be your chance to say I saw this person when they were independent. There is a lot to praise about this DVD but my favorite so far is Silent Razor. You will not find this level of art in 99% of film you can catch at the theatre. The nice thing about this disc is you know people put there blood sweat and tears into it and didn't see a dime. Each one of these films is something these people realy wanted to do. If you love independent film then don't pass this one up.,1069200000,2,498,3.9405940594059405
