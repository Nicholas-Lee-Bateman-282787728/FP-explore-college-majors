8704501,2,B00U646LWQ,"Possibly one of the most historically inaccurate western film ever made. Populated by 1990s ""I wanna be an actor"" young TV stars, it strains the imagination as a passable Western film. I was very disappointed in this entire mess. Adding Aston Kutcher as pseudo-comic relief was beyond the pale...",1527120000,,296,5.061224489795919
8704502,5,B00U646LWQ,Highly entertaining western.  James Van Der Beek and Ashton Kutcher give performances that prove they're talented actors as well as pretty faces.  Dylan McDermott is a bit more bland - I thought Randy Travis was more believable.  The script is quite good and it's nice to see Hollywood make a good western again.  Check it out.,1522713600,,327,4.785714285714286
