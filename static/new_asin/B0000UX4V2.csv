1948189,5,B0000UX4V2,"This charmer features sparkling dialogue and a breathtaking Rodgers & Hart score, including ""Lover"", ""Mimi"", and my own favorite, ""Isn't it Romantic?"" The romantic leads are terrific, and a colorful supporting cast including Charlie Ruggles, Myrna Loy, and C. Aubrey Smith, all keep the souffl-light story from falling. Directed by Rouben Mamoulian in the style of Ernst Lubitsch, this is often referred to as the finest Lubitsch picture Lubtisch never made. In any event, one of the great early romantic musicals.",1125878400,7,514,5.3580246913580245
1948190,5,B0000UX4V2,"My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).  Kreuger's commentary alone is worth the price of this DVD.  After seeing this film for the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles Kreuger's eyes.",1091232000,11,1008,4.530386740331492
1948191,5,B0000UX4V2,"Like champagne, the musical comedy ""Love Me Tonight"", is light, bubbly, and improves with age.  It's hard to fathom that this delightful movie was made over 70 years ago because it looks and feels fresh and contemporary.
Rouben Mamoulian directs with verve complemented by the vibrant black and white photography of Victor Milner. Master composer Richard Rodgers creates lovely, wistful melodies that stay with you.  And the erudite lyricist Lorenz Hart infuses his sophisticated lyrics with wit, charm, and innuendo.
The two leads, Maurice Chevalier as the smitten tailor, and Jeanette MacDonald, as the royal object of Chevalier's affection, have seldom been more appealing.
Here's a toast to the delectable artists who cultivated the sparkling, effervescent classic ""Love Me Tonight"".",1088294400,6,787,5.55
1948192,5,B0000UX4V2,"Rouben Mamoulian's LOVE ME TONIGHT is the finest impersonation of Ernst Lubitsch in the history of Hollywood.  It helped that he borrowed two of Lubitsch's most widely used stars.  Jeanette MacDonald had appeared in Lubitsch's MONTE CARLO in 1930 (with the marvelous Jack Buchanan, who is best know for his great role in THE BAND WAGON) and Maurice Chevalier had appeared in 1931's THE SMILING LIEUTENANT, and the appeared together in THE LOVE PARADE of 1929 and ONE HOUR WITH YOU earlier in 1932 (they would appear together again in Lubitsch's superb THE MERRY WIDOW in 1934 in one of the last great comedies before the Code).  If Mamoulian doesn't quite match Lubitsch in the latter's unsurpassed magic with the camera, he nonetheless more than equals him in his sense of play, of class conflict, and impish sense of mischief.
But in one regard he completely surpasses Lubitsch:  Mamoulian was able to work with songs the likes of which Lubitsch was never able to.  The film is filled with great songs by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart.  The score is so good that songs that would normally be the finest in a musical, like ""Mimi"" and ""Love Me Tonight"" are completely overshadowed by two of the greatest songs that the legendary team wrong:  the waltz-like ""Lover"" (sung by Jeanette MacDonald in a carriage) and the almost epic ""Isn't It Romantic?""  Rogers was one of the greatest composers the American stage or cinema has seen, but as fine as his music is in these two songs, Hart just might be a tad better.  The lyrics are simply astonishing.  Take these from ""Lover,"" which are closer to poetry than to mere song lyrics:  Lover, when I'm near you/ And I hear you speak my name/ Softly, in my ear you/ Breathe a flame.  The lyrics, on the other hand, of ""Isn't It Romantic?"" are cleverly nonchalant, many of the lines mere vowels as the singers hum rather than sing.  Later versions ""cleaned up"" the lyrics, but in the movie the rough, almost unfinished quality of the lyrics enhances their appeal.  It begins in Paris with Maurice Chevalier singing in his shop (with marvelous use of mirrors), and the tune leaving the shop on the lips of a customer, only to be passed onto a cab driver, from him to a fare who is a composer, on from him to a troop of soldiers marching in the countryside, and from them to a gypsy violinist who is overheard by Jeanette MacDonald in her chateau, where the song concludes.  It is a breathtaking performance.
There is so much nonchalant fun in this film!  For instance, a marvelous conversation between C. Aubrey Smith and Charles Butterworth in a stable, with a horse's head firmly wedged between them.  Or the remarkably humorous fox hunt.
This is a must-see film for anyone who loves classic cinema or pre-code musical comedies.  It is almost impossible to surpass in terms of cast, music, camera work, or humor.  Love it tonight.",1084665600,50,2871,4.6946107784431135
1948193,5,B0000UX4V2,"Can't add much to what others have said.  The classic Rodgers & Hart songs are great.  The stars are great.  The endlessly inventive stagings of the songs leave most other movie musicals looking stodgy indeed.
A burst of creativity and genius that didn't just expand the ways music could be used on film -- it exploded them.  LOVE ME TONIGHT is terrifically funny and entertaining, and even now, it seems ahead of its time.",1084492800,5,423,4.675675675675675
1948194,5,B0000UX4V2,"Frankly...upon buying this dvd, I had high hopes...but they were all surpassed by the material...I only had seen the young (well not so young, because he arrived to Hollywood in 1929, when he was over forty years old) Maurice Chevalier in Lubitsch's marvelous ""The Smiling Lieutenant"" (1931) and ""The Merry Widow"" (1934), both great landmark films & big achievements.... but ""Love Me Tonight"" is THE ""Gem"" of ""The Crown's Jewels.""
This must be the greatest pairing of Chevalier and MacDonald... Having not seen either ""The Love Parade"" (1929) nor ""One Hour With You"" (1932), I cannot say it 100% sure...but I'm pretty sure anyway.
I feel that if it wasn't for this musical, there wouldn't be a ""Gigi"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""The Harvey Girls"", ""Easter Parade""...or whatever...this one is the grandparent of all movie musicals...either transferred from Broadway or not...it's just perfect. A masterpiece by the great Rouben Mamoulian.
I even must say, hardly enough, that in my innermost self...I feel this even tops other Pre-Code all-time-fave of mine (which is not a musical) from the same year (1932), ""Trouble in Paradise"", Lubitsch's masterpiece.
I was amazed by the Pre-Code dialogue & situations, the finesse of the screenplay treatment, the witty dialogues, the fantastic numbers by Chevalier, MacDonald, et al: ""Isn't it Romantic"", ""Lover"", ""Mimi"", ""I'm an Apache"", the innovative opening sequence: ""The Song of Paree"", ""Love Me Tonight""...Really, when I read again on the dvd's package back that Leslie Halliwell said about it: ""The most fluently cinematic comedy musical ever made""...the statement is true, absolutely!!! and in its actual 89 minutes version ('cos it underwent several cuts for its re-release) ""Love Me Tonight"" is still THE LANDMARK MUSICAL OF ALL TIME.
I had never seen this film before, never-ever, only read (a lot) about it...and words are short of praise to this marvel... Chevalier, MacDonald, never have been better (alone or together)....Myrna Loy looks so ravishing, such a ""coquette"" as the Countess...C. Aubrey Smith at his authoritative best as the Duke....Charlie Ruggles, deliciously ""mischevious"" as Monsieur le Vicomte (The Viscount)...the three elderly aunts, played flawlessly by Elizabeth Patterson, Blanche Frederici and Ethel Griffies.....and last but not least...the great Charlie Butterworth utterly funny as a Count, pretending Jeanette.
By the way both stars characters bear their same names... they're Maurice (the tailor) and Jeanette (the Princess)....It's a treat!!...I cannot say enough to praise this film.
The transfer is beautiful...the image quality (from 1932) is better than Criterion's transfer of ""Trouble in Paradise"" (from the same year)...It looks sharp, with much contrast, in glorious black and white.
The Bonuses are real wonders...Chevalier singing ""Louise""... Jeanette giving a sensuous, tongue-in-cheek rendition of ""Love Me Tonight"" (Hollywood on Parade)....The audio commentary is precise, great, by Miles Kreuger...One has to watch the film really twice (with and without the audio commentary)...'cos the latter is absolutely very good.
The Screen Play Excerpts of the Deleted Scenes...are simply wonderful to undertsand the original story as it was intendend to be. And the Production  Documents and Censrorship Records, is plain-simply necessary material, to understand not only the reason of the cuts this gem underwent, during the Production Code's Reign, after 1934 (for its 1949 re-release)....but all the trouble that went on during its filming in 1932.
Music Lovers, Early Talkies lovers, Jeanette & Maurice Lovers, Pre-Code fans....do yourself a favour and buy this DVD immediately.
This DVD is worth every dollar it costs...I hope Universal Pictures will continue giving the copyrights the've got on the thirties Paramount movies, to Kino Video, Criterion, et al...'cos there's still too much to be restored and edited on this format (DVD): ""The Smiling Lieutenant"" (1931), ""The Story of Temple Drake"" (1933), ""Peter Ibbetson"" (1935), etc..",1076803200,102,4022,5.550488599348534
1948195,5,B0000UX4V2,"Kino has done a wonderful job with the DVD presentation of this great film. The transfer is excellent, with only a few speckles, and excellent shadow detail. Blacks look rich and vibrant, and the whites look brilliant. Suprisingly, for a 71 year old movie, there is hardly any grain, and I am watching this film on a 50 inch screen. Even the stock Paris footage looks amazing and clean. There are hardly any jump cuts, except for the cuts instigated by hard-line censor Breen for subsequent reissues. The frames show remarkable stability. In summary, I was extremely surprised. The soundtrack does not quite match the quality of the video. However, all the dialogue is very clear, with an occasional hiss on the mono soundtrack. Let's not forget the age of the film.
The commentary by Miles Kreuger is about a 4 out of 5. He is very interested in the film, and the works of director Mamoulian, and is informative, especially in matters regarding the horrendous cuts inflicted by the post-code censor. He seems to know alot about the cast, especially the supporting cast. However, do we really need to know the birth date and the life story of an actor who has a very minor role, that is, only occupies seconds of screen time. Hopefully, Miles may improve in subsequent audio commentaries.
Congratulations Kino, and thanks for allowing cinephiles to finally view this film at home.",1074297600,9,1380,4.827004219409282
1948196,5,B0000UX4V2,"Long absent from home video titles, 1932's LOVE ME TONIGHT has finally been released on dvd in all of its glory - and a wonderfully pristine print it is too! There are enough superlatives already published about this film and its creators, director Rouben Mamoulian and Rogers & Hart, that I don't need to think up new ones - Leonard Maltin calls it simply ""one of the best musicals ever made"" - but it's worth observing that Hollywood never made another musical even remotely like it until the recent CHICAGO. (OK, let's credit 1933's HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM, a notorious flop.)
Even in some of our most beloved musicals - such as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN - let's admit it, the story stops dead in its tracks to perform a musical number.  At best, the number is usually redundant of information already provided to the viewer.  Rogers and Hart told LOVE ME TONIGHT's story through its musical numbers, a seemingly obvious approach that films have steadfastly ignored all these decades except for CHICAGO where LMT's approach seems to have been rediscovered. Perhaps the quality that distinguishes LMT from later and better-known musicals is its lack of pretension, indeed, its playfulness.  Despite the film's imagination and continual inventiveness, it is never impressed with itself (oh, that the ""great"" MGM musicals of the 1950s had this quality!).
The only problems I found are minor and not the fault of the film itself.  There seems to be a slight rumble on the soundtrack when the scene is in silence, most notably in the famous opening sequence of Paris at dawn. I also wondered why some slight speckling was not removed from the opening titles. These two items aside, Kino Video did a great job and provided some great supplemental material including a thoughtful essay by Miles Kreuger. If you have any interest in movie musicals, LMT is ""must"" viewing!",1072656000,25,1857,4.867088607594937

1948218,4,B0000UX4V2,"Although I'm not terribly fond of musicals as a genre, a few manage to transcend the cloying artificiality that comes with breaking into song every five minutes, and Rouben Mamoulian's 'Love Me Tonight' (Paramount, 1932) is one of them.  As other reviewers have pointed out the film is technically, rhythmically superb, showcasing the full potential of the medium (a seamlessly synchronous marriage of clever dialogue, action, sets and camerawork complemented by a multitude of dynamic performances) in ways that most modern moviemakers wouldn't even attempt.  The Rodgers and Hart melodies are joyful and catchy (forgive me, but sometimes irritatingly so) and woven so smartly into the fabric of the story you can't imagine the thing working without them.  It is a true original, a progenitor that rarely has been equaled in the long, tortuous history of the Hollywood spectacle.  Kino offers a nicely restored print with a few interesting extras.

1948223,5,B0000UX4V2,"Love Me Tonight, (1932). This 89-minute long, black and white 1932 classic is a sweet, infectious, romantic musical comedy featuring Great American Songbook music by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.  It  stars the ever charming French crooner Maurice Chevalier as Maurice Courtelin, a Parisian tailor who is owed a great deal of money  by the titled but penniless French nobleman, Vicomte Gilbert de Vareze (Charles Ruggles).  While he hopes to scratch up some money somewhere, Vareze moves the tailor into the family chateau and introduces him as a baron.  Soon the entire aristocratic household is enchanted by him, except for haughty Princess Jeanette (Jeanette MacDonald).  The script was written by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young, based upon a play by Leopold Marchand and Paul Armont.

Considering its age, its origins, and its wealth of talent before and behind the camera, a viewer might expect that it was directed by Mamoulian's colleague, the uber-talented German refugee Ernst Lubitsch, but it was not.  It was directed and produced by Rouben Mamoulian, ( APPLAUSE,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Jekyll-Mr-Hyde-1932/dp/B001J1O8C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (1932)</a>with Fredric March), an experienced Broadway and Hollywood director of musicals, a man with a lot of technological talent: he even did the film editing.  Well, Lubitsch was known for his witty scripts; Mamoulian wasn't necessarily.  But nevertheless this script is witty, and risqu; it's a real shame that it's not subtitled in this only recently released DVD.

The film is set in and around Paris, France, at roughly the time of its making.  It was the third of four co-starrings of Chevalier(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gigi/dp/B001NEPRX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gigi</a>), and MacDonald(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rose-Marie/dp/B007Z3N7BE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rose Marie</a>), following on LOVE PARADE  and ONE HOUR WITH YOU.  Chevalier was his usual effortlessly effervescently charming self; MacDonald was stiff, but not quite as stiff as she would become, and in fine voice.  They were supported by several comic stalwarts.  The Charleses: Ruggles,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goodbye-Love-1933/dp/B004Q5896C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goodbye Love (1933)</a>, as the Viscount de Vareze, debtor; and Butterworth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swing-High-Swing-Low/dp/B0010XOVTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swing High, Swing Low</a>, as the Count de Savignac, aged suitor of the princess, who has fallen on his flute.  C. Aubrey Smith,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Four-Feathers/dp/B004DHAC04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Four Feathers</a>, as the paterfamilias, the Duke d'Artelines. Bert Roach as Emile, Courtelin's friend.  Robert Greig as the butler Flammond: did they ever again make a comic film with a butler after he passed?  Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Armand de Fontinac.  Elizabeth Patterson as the first aunt, Ethel Griffies as the second, and Blanche Friderici as the third; a trio who calmed the three witches of Shakespeare in his famous Scottish play. A youngish Gabby Hayes has a bit, uncredited one-line part as the grocer in the opening montage.

The picture introduced a remarkably beautiful young Myrna Loy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Blandings-Builds-His-Dream-House/dp/B004WKH4LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House</a>, fresh from her early years of playing mysterious Oriental ladies, two years before the Thin Man series.  She plays Countess Valentine, a man-chasing gal who goes for anything in pants, and even gets some of the movie's most witty lines.  In a scene where the Princess Jeanette becomes ill, and a doctor is required, her and Jeanette's mutual cousin de Vareze asks Valentine ""Could you go for a doctor?"" She replies, ""Certainly, bring him right in.""  Dr, de Fontinac will diagnose Jeanette's illness as, ""A peach must be eaten, a drum must be beaten, and a woman needs something like that.""

The great Edith Head did the women's gowns.  The Internet Movie Database quotes Loy's autobiography as saying she was originally to wear the white empire-style dress for the party sequence, but Jeanette MacDonald was jealous of how she looked and insisted that she herself would wear it.  Loy surrendered the dress, but then went down to the costume room and, with a friend's help, put together the black lace outfit she wears in the final film. She stole the scene.  The 1932 film was made before the enforcement of Hollywood's repressive, censorious Hays Production Code.  In its post code reissue, Loy's part in the ""Mimi"" reprise was deleted: her negligee was deemed too revealing.  The motion picture was trimmed down to 96 minutes.  Those missing minutes have never been restored and are considered lost:  a further seven minutes has since been lost.

This is a classic poor boy rich girl romantic musical comedy, such as we might expect from Mamoulian's colleague Lubitsch.  Mamoulian didn't quite have the Lubitsch touch, of course, but he combined his musical romance with advanced technology for the time, and plenty of style: he may even have handled its distinguished music more adeptly than Lubitsch could.  At any rate, his film feels modern today.  The opening montage, of Paris and Chevalier rhythmically awakening, is simply marvelous, and looks like a series of Eugene Atget photos come to life.  Chevalier's strut down busy streets might easily have helped inspire John Travolta's famous strut down Brooklyn's 86th Street in SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. Yet the earlier sequence was filmed on Paramount's back lot.

And then there's the music.  Rogers and Hart, (BABES IN ARMS, PAL JOEY) were here inventing the modern movie musical.  Their songs are so well-integrated into the movie because they were written first: then the script was written around them.  We get the title song and the even more popular ""Isn't It Romantic."" ""Lover,"" and the wonderful ""Mimi"" sequence; ""Mimi"" was to be Chevalier's life-long signature song.  The picture opens with the promise that ""Once upon a time there was a princess and a prince charming, who was not a prince, but who WAS charming,"" and so, surely, is the picture.  Charming, and then some.",1369958400,,6565,5.991425509110397
1948224,5,B0000UX4V2,"This is a nice look at a young Maurice Chevalier, supported entertainingly by famous actresses Myrna Loy and Jeanette MacDonald, among others.

The basis of the story is that Maurice, a tailor, and his friends are taken in by a titled dandy who doesn't control his own funds, and doesn't pay his debts. When Maurice travels to the mansion of the Duke ... the dandy's uncle and the key to the purse strings ... to demand payment, he winds up in a masquerade as a Baron. Of course, this leads to a romance with the Princess (MacDonald).

The movie is a delight of off-beat musical numbers and occasionally rhyming dialogue, with clever witticisms liberally tossed in. Of particular note is an early sequence where Maurice sings ""Isn't it Romantic"" in his tailor shop, and the song quickly goes viral, ending up with the Princess singing it out her window. In the meantime the lyrics undergo quite a few amusing interpretations. Later in the movie, when Maurice is exposed to the nobility as a tailor, we get the hilarious number ""The Son of a Gun is a Tailor!"", which moves throughout the mansion where nobility and servants alike give their disapproving take on the news. The sequence cracked me up to the point that I had to replay it a few times to hear some of the things I was laughing through the first time around.

The story is good spirited, clever, and funny. The musical numbers are very different from most musicals you are used to, as they often travel around from group to group and contain many jokes and non-traditional lyrics.

A few lines from the doctor's examination of the Princess after she faints could cause problems for you if you happen to have a sip in your mouth as you hear them.

I particularly like these ""talkies"" from the first few years after silent where the movie comes across more like a stage production ... a style largely abandoned after the early to mid-thirties.

If you like these early cinematic gems and aren't of the group that devalues anything in black and white, then this movie is :

HIGHLY recommended.",1365292800,2,2051,4.649171270718232
1948225,2,B0000UX4V2,"This was NOT a great musical. It was fun to see all these people when they were young,as I only remember them older here in the states. Maurice was his usual 'speak sing' and Jeanette was learning but great voice. This would not fit the title of 'musical' as we know them today.",1360454400,,278,4.264150943396227
1948226,5,B0000UX4V2,"""Once upon a time there was a princess and a Prince Charming... who was not a prince but who was charming.""

To me, habitually, ""delicious"" is an adjective that applies only to food. Except that, once in a blue moon, you could apply it to something like this musical film, because it's that good. 1932's LOVE ME TONIGHT is delicious fare. It counts as one of the most scintillating and influential of the early musicals. It doesn't hurt that it's farcical, too, and madcap, and very funny. And if you're a fan of Maurice Chevalier and of the beautiful, heavy-lidded Jeanette MacDonald, well, then, your cup runneth over like a mother.

Easy-going Parisian tailor Maurice Courtelin doesn't give a stitch if he doesn't get rich, but still one can't live on carefree attitude alone. And so off he goes to the posh chateau of an aristocratic client to collect on an outstanding bill. But, as Maurice finds, it's practically impossible to try to squeeze funds from a scion of old nobility. Because of this and that (but mostly because of a beautiful princess), he ends up posing as a baron.

LOVE ME TONIGHT is a treat from start to finish. Director Rouben Mamoulian had never done a musical before, and so wasn't at all confined to conventions of the genre. The camera work here is innovative, and the witty musical numbers have a scope to them, and a vibrancy and are so imaginatively staged. The film's opening moments are a marvel, as Parisians go about tending to their morning routines, the various noises of their activities merging into this symphony of harmonizing rhythms.

And note how Mamoulian stages the film's most memorable track, ""Isn't It Romantic?"" This classic tune, as arranged in the film, assumes a domino effect. Chevalier kicks it off, and the song is passed on from one singer to the next, to eventually grace Jeanette MacDonald's ears so many miles away. Even before they formally meet, the ""Isn't It Romantic"" sequence links the two leads together, the playful tailor and the moonlit princess. It's worth noting that Chevalier launches the song in sardonic fashion, and yet by the time MacDonald has had a crack at it, the song's taken on a softer, more romantic tone. That should tell you something about our two leads.

I harbor mad love for several of the songs here, and Rogers & Hart's smart lyrics. ""Isn't It Romantic?"", of course. But also MacDonald's comic rendition of ""Lover"" and Chevalier's lecherous take on ""Mimi."" ""Lover"" and ""Mimi"" are two songs introduced one almost immediately after the other and which reflect the two characters' differing viewpoints on love and romance. ""Mimi, you funny little good for nothing Mimi."" Watch the saucy expressions flitting across Chevalier's face, and MacDonald's offended reaction. That's gold. I also enjoyed ""The Son of a Gun Is Nothing But A Tailor,"" the terrifically clever musical number the chateau's outraged household goes into once Maurice's secret is out.

The sets are lavish, the costumes exquisite. The script sparkles and is chock full of wit and witty innuendo. The supporting cast is marvelous. Charlie Ruggles and Charles Butterworth are two very good comics. There's something frightfully delicious (damn, there it is again!) in watching the gruff and imposing C. Aubrey Smith belt out a verse of ""Mimi."" Myrna Loy steals all the scenes she cares to, as the horny Countess Valentine, and she owns some of the movie's best quotes. She delivers maybe her most memorable line after the princess had again fainted, and Valentine is asked if she could go for a doctor. Loy's instant reply: ""Certainly. Bring him right in."" Heh. Sucks to say, thanks to the censorship bureau, we lose out on a deleted scene featuring Loy in a racy negligee singing her own verse of ""Mimi."" But never mind. What an operetta! Rouben Mamoulian is brilliant! I really do think LOVE ME TONIGHT is one of the most perfect musicals ever made. In 1932, it was certainly ahead of its time.

Wonderful entertainment.",1278374400,,322,5.46
1948238,5,B0000UX4V2,"Directed by Rouben Mamoulian and released by Paramount in 1932, LOVE ME TONIGHT was the film that the director proclaimed was his masterpiece. Coming from the man who made such diverse cinema treasures as DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (1931), QUEEN CHRISTINA (1933), and THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940), that's saying a lot.

Often cited as one of the greatest musicals ever made, LOVE ME TONIGHT rates its high marks in Mamoulian's brilliant, innovative style of having the songs advance the story, all of it done with the visual flair of a true cinematic genius. The apex of this style is reached at the end when princess Jeanette MacDonald, on horseback, chases after the train that's carrying her dejected lover, Maurice Chevalier. It's no exaggeration to say that what Mamoulian does here with music, action, sound, and cross-cutting is absolutely magnificent.

Put simply, LOVE ME TONIGHT is pure perfection; once you've experienced its magic and have been captivated by its irresistible charm, you'll never forget it. A winner all the way.

The audio commentary is by Miles Kreuger, who knew Rouben Mamoulian personally and is therefore authoritative. Other extras include 2 musical shorts with Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier, photos and promotional material, the original trailer, and documents pertaining to the production and various censorship requirements.

1948239,4,B0000UX4V2,"For those who have read the other reviews, it will be needless to state that this is a fine movie.  It is!  You will be the richer for having experienced it.  The opening sequences in particular--the sounds of the city, the unique journey of ""Isn't It Romantic""--captivate the mind.  But the enthusiastic praise heaped on it with obviously grateful and loving hands does a dis-service to new viewers, who will sit down in front of the show with expectations of something rather different than the show turns out to be.  Unless your definition of ""movie musical"" is very different from that of most, this is not the greatest film musical ever; but it certainly is a refreshingly different one.  Some of the songs are standards; others you won't remember five minutes later.  Those interested in movie musicals look for exciting dance sequences--you won't find them here.  Do we care a great deal about the characters?  Nope.  Lots of hilarity?  No; but you will have a laugh or two.  Scintillating lyrics?  You won't know unless you have a libretto to look at, what with Chevalier's accent and MacDonald's operatic style of singing.  And this ends up diminishing the integrity of the show, because the average member of the audience won't have heard some things he needed to know, things which came only from the lyrics (for instance, the very last image in the movie is a response to something trilled not very clearly an hour previously).  The performances are solid, the sets wonderful, the music pleasant, the pace quick, the camera work beautiful, the scenes and characters varied, and so on...  For what it is, it's faultless, and you will smile with contentment at the end.  But it is sui generis--in a category by itself--and the audience member should come to it with meter set closer to ""mild screwball comedy with songs"" than to ""one of the great movie musicals.""  Enjoy it!  But don't think you're going to be getting ""Show Boat"" . . .",1254441600,4,1946,4.772455089820359
1948240,5,B0000UX4V2,"I can't stand Chevalier, but here he's probably just right.  ""Isn't it Romantic"" has an incredible montage from Maurice's tailor shop, taxi, soldiers, gypsies, and finally up to Jeanette in her high castle bedroom window where she is wooed by Charles Butterworth.  Wonderful characters actors abound in this Mamoulian musical.  Myrna Loy, Charlie Ruggles, C. Aubrey Smith, Elizabeth Patterson, others I can't remember the names of.

I had no idea that ""Isn't it Romantic,"" ""Lover,"" and ""Mimi"" were all from this early musical.

And the dialogue is in rhyme when Jeanette is examined by the doctor, my favorite scene, very funny, totally unique.

Chevalier has a stunning number called Apache.  Really evokes the mood.  In fact, the lighting is like film noir.

Just the opening scene is a masterpiece as Paris awakes.",1249171200,,817,5.128787878787879

1948243,5,B0000UX4V2,"So I'm watching ""Dreamgirls"" --- well, sort of watching; the screen is blurred by my tears of joy at the mere existence of such a dazzling achievement. And I'm thinking that it's ever so slightly familiar.

It's not the theme, though this is hardly the first film to show how original art is watered down so it can thrill a mass audience.

It's not the music, which starts as strong soul, transits through powerful R&B and ends up as a homogenized vehicle for a star who is, by now, just ""passing"" as a black woman.

Ah! It's the way the story is told, a quasi-operatic style in which dialogue segues into song --- and instead of talking to one another, characters sing their thoughts back and forth.

And then, because although I have trouble remembering last week, I'm strong on old movies, I got it: ""Dreamgirls"" is cousin to ""Love Me Tonight,"" a 1932 musical by Rouben Mamoulian.

You may never have heard of this film. Blame that on television, which long ago turned away from late-night broadcasts of black-and-white classics. Had ""Love Me Tonight"" been on and had you seen the opening sequence, you would have been hooked --- it's that rare combination: great originality and total fun.

We're in Paris. Early morning, as the city awakes. A workman shows up with a pick and starts chipping away at the pavement. Another sweeps. A knife sharpener puts an edge on the first blade of the day. Two cobblers take seats outside their shop and hammer at heels. A woman beats a carpet.

It's pure rhythm --- street sound as melody. And it's just a little too much for young Maurice Chevalier, who shuts his window, finishes dressing and heads downstairs. But hey, he's Maurice Chevalier; as he walks down the street, he sings to his neighbors. And they sing back to him.

Time to get serious: Maurice is a tailor. A good one. And, he thinks, a lucky one --- he has just made 15 suits for Vicomte Gilbert de Vareze, the most fashionable man in Paris. His future is assured.

You know the punch line: The Vicomte is a penniless deadbeat who has stiffed every tradesman on the block. He lives off crumbs from his disapproving uncle, the Duke d'Artelines. So Maurice charges off to the Duke's chateau to extract payment.

On the way, he meets Jeannette MacDonald, and falls instantly in love. Once at the chateau, there is the inevitable confusion about Maurice's identity --- the last thing the Vicomte wants his uncle to know is that a tailor has come to collect a small fortune --- and Maurice gets the chance to try his charm on MacDonald, who it turns out, is a widow.

Not just any widow. A widow who feels she is, at 21, ""wasting away."" Her doctor, with an eye on her breasts, disagrees. His diagnosis: She's ""being wasted.""

Throughout, the dialogue is brisk and racy:

Jeanette: What are you doing now?

Maurice: I'm thinking. I'm thinking of you without these clothes.

Jeanette: Open your eyes at once!

Maurice: Oh no, pardon, madam. With different clothes. Smart clothes.

No wonder the censors snipped some 15 minutes from the film.

The music is by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart. It includes such classics as ""Isn't It Romantic?"" and is, as the opening sequence suggests, integral to the film. But let Mamoulian explain: ""I decided to make the movie lyrical, thoroughly stylized: a film in which the whole action of actors, as well as the movement of camera and cutting was rhythmic. Then I got Rodgers and Hart to write the music....We finished the whole score before I began to work on the script. We did the whole thing to a metronome, because we couldn't carry an orchestra round with us.""

Mistaken identity. Stars at their zenith. Classic songs. Double entendres galore. Even a happy ending: ""Once upon a time there was a princess and a prince charming...who was not a prince but who was charming...and they lived happily ever after.""

If you have any weakness for old movies, don't miss ""Love Me Tonight.""",1168300800,11,3923,4.666182873730044
1948244,5,B0000UX4V2,"Another perfect film is now readily available on DVD.  This film is widely recognised as one of the best musicals ever.  It combines a superb Rodgers and Hart score with the subtle sexy humour of Ernst Lubitsch and the visual flair which Rouben Mamoulian, the director, brought to so many of his films.

Maurice Chevalier plays a tailor who meets princess Jeanette MacDonald when he visits her castle to collect outstanding debts from Charlie Ruggles. Macdonald is a widow who keeps fainting not from ""wasting away"" as the doctor diagnoses, but ""being wasted"".  Macdonald falls for Chevalier and after a few plot devices which will keep them apart because he is a commoner, they reunite to live happily ever after. If the story sounds like a fairy tale, it is but that does not detract from the enchantment of the piece.

Chevalier plays his usual charming self and Macdonald is sexy and funny in a way she rarely showed with Nelson Eddy.  Myrna Loy is ravishing as her nymphomaniac cousin and this comes as a surprise to those who know her as the perfect wife.  All of the supporting cast are memorable though Charlie Ruggles steals every scene in which he appears.

The score includes the incomparable ""Mimi"", ""Lover"" and ""Isn't it Romantic"". The commentary by Miles Kreuger is outstanding, avoiding mere biographical details and really giving us insight into the relevance of this film in 1932 and why it still stands up today.  There is a lot of information about what was cut from the film when it was reissued, cuts which have been lost for ever at this date. The DVD print is excellent but there is quite a bit of background surface noise at times which can be distracting.",1138752000,10,1680,4.726027397260274
1948245,5,B0000UX4V2,"If you haven't seen ""Love Me Tonight,"" or are not familiar with it, I definitely reccomend that you check it out.  This is a great example of the brilliance of the collaboration of Richard Rogers (songwriter) and Lorenz Hart (lyricist).  Not only is the music witty, biting and intelligent (and has stood the test of time today), full of innuendo and pointed jabs at the hang-ups of society and the class system, but the whole film succeeds as a musical, comedy, love story and social commentary.

Maurice (Maurice Chevalier) is a Parisian tailor dripping with charm, wit and a true ""joie de vivre"" (joy for life).  He is truly content to make suits for his customers, flirt with pretty mademoiselles and muse on his future--ideally with a wife and a pack of children on the way.  It is when one of his royal customers (Charles Ruggles) stiffs him on the payment of fifteen suits that he decides to seek redemption and payment for his merchandise.  It is on his journey to the chateau of this customer, that he encounter the beautiful Princess Jeanette (Jeanette McDonald), a 22 year old young lady wasting away in her tower, awaiting the arrival of Prince Charming.

This musical combines racy, pre-censorship code humor, hysterical musical numbers comparable to up-tempo comedic operatic arias, and cutting edge camera tricks (slow motion, zoom lense, etc.) that were years ahead of its time.  You can tell that the young Maurice Chevalier was getting a kick out of hamming it up for the cameras, as a true, romantic Frenchman, in love with love.  I will honestly be surprised if you don't get swept up in his infectious warmth or the irrerepressible charm of this great, underappreciated little masterpiece......",1132444800,10,1715,4.906574394463668

of gypsies whose singing is overheard and picked up finally by a lovelorn Jeanette McDonald on a chateau balcony.
2. The score-  Rogers & Hart at their best, including the Chevalier standard, ""Mimi"" and McDonald singing ""Lover"".
3. The supporting cast, including young Myrna Loy and ""star"" supporting actors of the time, Charlie Ruggles, C. Aubrey Smith, Charles Butterworth.
 4. Prime 1930's Hollywood style double entendre, also McDonald as you have never seen her being measured by Chevalier for a new outfit.
5. Also 1930's style social commentary (Rodgers & Hart were upper Westside Manhattan liberals) concerning class distinctions- - even including a plug for humane treatment of animals.
