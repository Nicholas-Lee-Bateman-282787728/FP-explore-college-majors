5374879,4,B00A1AU6VM,"Warner Archive has released all six of Roscoe Arbuckle's talking comedies, filling out the set with 13 Vitaphone shorts featuring (but not starring) Shemp Howard. This is great news for those who enjoy two-reel comedies, and for Three Stooges fans who admire Shemp's improvisational talents. As with most assortments of short subjects, the comedy content varies in style and quality, but the batting average is very good.

The Arbuckle shorts are uneven (in this writer's opinion, two are great, two good, one fair, one disappointing) but Mr. Arbuckle himself is always endearing, enhancing variable slapstick scripts with his pantomime skills, friendly personality, and pleasant baritone speaking voice. His talkie debut, HEY, POP!, is a wonderful two-reeler in which short-order cook Roscoe takes charge of an abandoned boy; Arbuckle blends sentiment and comedy expertly. After the success of this short, Arbuckle became a charter member of Vitaphone's slapstick-comedy brigade and the scripts became situation-based, as Roscoe and company are turned loose in a bakery, a society dinner, a grocery store, a fancy china shop, and so on. HEY, POP! and BUZZIN' AROUND are the most inspired of the Arbuckle shorts, with the other four having their moments. IN THE DOUGH has some dated dialogue humor, as ZaSu Pitts imitator Marie Marion affects a persistent speech impediment, and HOW'VE YOU BEAN? has rubber-limbed vaudeville dancer Fritz Hubert reprising Buster Keaton's role in Arbuckle's THE BUTCHER BOY. Shemp Howard made his earliest short-subject appearances with Arbuckle, playing minor roles (in CLOSE RELATIONS he doesn't even speak).

The balance of this two-DVD set showcases Shemp Howard's rise from silent bit player to full-fledged featured comedian. He is not the star of these shorts, but his fans will enjoy his verbal and visual contributions. He is usually cast as the starring comedian's pal or foil; Shemp and Jack Haley make a good team in Haley's last Vitaphone short, SALT WATER DAFFY, and Shemp shares the spotlight with Vitaphone stars Harry Gribbon, Ben Blue, and the forgotten Gus Shy. Former Keystone comic Harry Gribbon's ART TROUBLE will be of interest because of James Stewart's first screen appearance (he doesn't indulge in any slapstick; he merely plays straight for Gribbon and Howard). Ben Blue, fresh from Hal Roach's ""Taxi Boys"" series, is an acquired taste and his mannerisms may be an ordeal for some viewers, but they are relieved by Shemp's antics. Gus Shy's sunny disposition plays well amid the comic villainy and roughhouse comedy surrounding him; in I SCREAM Shy is caught between two factions of gangsters, with Shemp as one of the gang members. Movie buffs will enjoy seeing a very young Penny Singleton (under her real name, Dorothy McNulty) opposite dialect comics George Givot and Charles Judels in HOW D'YA LIKE THAT? In later life Singleton had no memory of this short at all, and howled with combined horror and delight when she saw herself in a Tarzan skit!

Vitaphone's New York studio hired supporting players from the New York stage (like Donald MacBride, who appears in a few, and Lionel Stander, who appears throughout the set as the local bully/gangster/authority figure). There is a lot of outdoor photography in this set and New Yorkers will especially enjoy seeing actual 1930s street scenes of Brooklyn and its immediate environs.

The source material appears to be excellent 16mm prints prepared for television in 1957. Picture and sound are excellent.

This writer hopes that Warner Archive will follow this enjoyable set with more of Shemp Howard's Vitaphones. After serving his apprenticeship as second banana, he advanced to co-starring and then starring roles, which would make a great Volume Two.",1355443200,10,3768,5.24212271973466
8545984,4,B00A1AU6VM,"Being a 3 Stooges fan, I got this mainly for the Shemp shorts to fill out my collection of Shemp ""solos"", while some of his appearances are a blink & you miss him type situation, some of his best stuff from the two years represented here are when he is teamed up with either Harry Gribbon or Fatty Arbuckle, whose entire Vitaphone collection is represented here. Some good stuff, here for the erase they were made in",1483920000,,416,4.415584415584416
8545985,5,B00A1AU6VM,"Great collection of Fatty Arbuckle's final films, and for Shemp Fan's what can I say, except you better go purchase Volume 2 to go with this!
Great film to DVD transfers.  Very clean copies. A pleasure to watch.",1446163200,,211,4.552631578947368
8545986,4,B00A1AU6VM,Very little is really known about the collaborations between Roscoe Arbuckle and Shemp Howard but this collection sheds some light on that association. It was quite early in their respective careers but Volume 1 provides some real insights into what they were doing at this time. Quite a fascinating peek at these two important comic actors.,1404518400,,341,5.107142857142857
8545987,4,B00A1AU6VM,"As a long time silent film enthusiast, I have enjoyed Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle's comedy shorts since I first saw them. It was Arbuckle who first brought Buster Keaton into movies and Keaton always acknowledged this fact. However it has only been in the last 20 years that it has been possible to see many of the Arbuckle comedies because of the scandal surrounding him and many of these have come from foreign archives. For those who don't know, back in 1921 when he was at the height of his popularity, Arbuckle was accused of raping an actress at a Labor Day party who later died. It turns out that the charges were completely false and the accuser was a convicted blackmailer but the press had a field day and although exonerated with an apology, Arbuckle was banned from the screen because of moral outrage. He continued to direct under the name of William Goodrich (his father's name) but made no official film appearances until this set of 6 talkie shorts for Vitaphone in 1932-1933.

I had known about the sound shorts after reading a book on Arbuckle (THE DAY THE LAUGHTER STOPPED) but didn't know if they would ever be made available to see outside of film archives and finally here they are as part of the Warner Brothers Archive Collection. Since this is officially billed as the THE VITAPHONE COMEDY COLLECTION - VOLUME 1 and features 13 other early sound comedies including several with Shemp Howard (who appears in Arbuckle's last short IN THE DOUGH along with a young Lionel Stander), I'll confine my comments to the Arbuckle shorts only. The reason that there are only 6 Arbuckle shorts is that he died in his sleep shortly after making IN THE DOUGH at the age of 46. Arbuckle had just signed a contract to appear in feature films and at least he died believing he had finally made it back after a decade of exile. While they are of varying quality material wise, it's great to have them available at last and in remarkably good prints too.

Anyone familiar with the Arbuckle silent comedies up until 1920 will recognize many of the gags employed here. The first short, HEY POP! which features Arbuckle as a cook, recycles gags from THE WAITER'S BALL (1916), THE BUTCHER BOY (1917) and appropriately THE COOK (1918). BUZZIN' AROUND reunites him with his nephew and frequent silent screen partner Al St. John. HOW'VE YOU BEAN? recycles material he first did with Buster Keaton including the famous ""molasses in the hat"" routine. By the time of the fourth short TOMALIO, which seems inspired by Harold Lloyd's WHY WORRY (1924), there is more story driven mayhem although the concluding foot race, lifted from his earlier GOOD NIGHT NURSE (1919), has its moments. CLOSE RELATIONS and IN THE DOUGH round out the sextet with the former being better than the latter. Arbuckle had a good strong voice and it's great to finally be able to see (and hear) him at the end of his career.",1396483200,3,2890,4.687007874015748
8545988,4,B00A1AU6VM,"My husband is very into old comedy shorts, especially anything that included any members of the Three Stooges! Thank you for sending the  product so quickly!",1388188800,,157,5.038461538461538
8545989,4,B00A1AU6VM,"Silent film comedian Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle is mostly remembered for the scandalous 1921 rape/murder trial in which he was found not guilty. Although fully exonerated, Arbuckle's Hollywood career was ruined for the duration of the '20's, but he made a successful comeback in a string of short comedies produced in Brooklyn by the Vitaphone Corp. in 1932-'33.

The Warner Archive has compiled six Arbuckle shorts in their two disc, Vitaphone Comedy Collection Vol. One. While these films don't quite measure up with Arbuckle's often innovative silent comedies, they still have their moments of masterful slapstick and funny gags that makes them worth checking out.

 Of special interest to Three Stooges fans is the appearance of Shemp Howard at the start of his movie career in two Arbuckle shorts, as well as many more he did with other comics. There's a total of nineteen shorts in this collection spanning from 1932-'34.

The quality of this DVD-R is A-1, appearing to have been sourced from beautiful 35mm nitrate prints. If you're interested in expanding your appreciation of classic screen comedy, you'll want to pick up this great set.

Highly recommended.",1376092800,6,1164,5.170212765957447
8545990,4,B00A1AU6VM,"Roscoe Arbuckle got his film start working for Mack Sennett, whose comedy style was broad, frenetic and anarchic. Arbuckle did not move as far from these roots as Buster Keaton did, and this is still evident in the Arbuckle talkies. As films, they are rather insane, and often not so much funny as bizarre, but there is a certain fascination in this approach. If you like the path that Laurel & Hardy took with their talkies in which they became increasingly refined, then Arbuckle is not for you, but if you are interested in watching broad characterizations and roughhouse comedy expertly performed, then you will have some fun here. The stories don't always make sense, and the action is sometimes painful, but this collection is a valuable time capsule of a style of comedy that echoes even into the present day.",1368835200,5,816,4.794326241134752

8545992,4,B00A1AU6VM,"A must for Fatty Arbuckle fans,his last 6 films, a comic genius, Roscoe still shines great in this collection, too bad he died young, he was on the way to a promising return to the screen. The rest of the disc is fun to watch. This was worth the purchase-good sound and picture quality. I showed this to young kids and they laughed at the comedy of Roscoe,and loved all the shows.",1356480000,2,380,4.291666666666667
8545993,4,B00A1AU6VM,"Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle is finally given a chance at a revival after being cleared of any crimes in the San Francisco incident, only to succumb to a heart attack after six films.
The earliest of the Arbuckle comedies look & feel like his old silent comedies, just with a microphone around to capture the sound. Roscoe's physical talent is well presented here. However after just 3 films the Arbuckle comedies start to loose their unique charm and become typical early sound comedies. Shemp makes a brief appearance as a crazy boy in ""CLOSE RELATIONS"" but gets a substantial role in ""IN THE DOUGH"" as a gangster's henchman. The DOUGH comedy is a bit hard to watch, the gangsters are too serious and threatening.
One critique about Roscoe's performance in sound films I would make is that he needed a Voice Coach.  While his body is living the comedy, his voice is just speaking the lines with no emotion.  He does seem to be more at ease with sound as he progresses, one can only wonder what he would have been capable of had his health allowed him.

For the rest of the set we get a mix of comedies & musicals that Shemp makes appearances in.  Three Stooges fans may get frustrated because there is not enough Shemp to satisfy, but these are rare performances we fans have not had a good chance to see and are grateful that we now have that chance.

The films run about 21 minutes each (quite long for a comedy short) unless noted.
I have given star ratings to each film. *****= very good down to * = which is just watchable.
Quick reference: Shemp's co-starring roles are in ""Salt Water Daffy"", ""I Scream"", ""Here Comes Flossie"", ""Pugs and Kisses"", ""Corn on the Cop"", & ""Art Trouble"".

Disc #1

ROSCOE ""FATTY"" ARBUCKLE ""BIG V COMEDIES"".
#1466-1467 ""HEY POP"" (1932) ***** a prime example of what Roscoe could have been doing all these years! Just watch him work his magic cooking in the kitchen, juggling the utensils!
#1509-1510 ""BUZZIN' AROUND"" (1932) ***** with silent comic Al St. John, and ""Our Gang's"" Pete the Pup (the dog with the circle around the eye) (1932) another grand example of silent comedy done with sound. Roscoe is in top form as he invents a protective liquid that prevents things from breaking. And just watch his vintage jalopy straight out of the silent comedy days!
#1525-1526 ""HOW'VE YOU BEAN"" (1933) **** Roscoe, teamed with Fritz Hubert here, is still a joy to watch as he opens a General Store and encounters Mexican Jumping Beans. Roscoe re-does his classic 'Molasses' routine that he did with Buster Keaton.
#1537-1538 ""TOMALIO"" (1933) ** Season 2 of the Arbuckle Comedies starts with a slight misfire, Roscoe is stuck in a dictatorial foreign country facing the firing squad. The Three Stooges did this story much better.
#1556-1557 ""CLOSE RELATIONS"" (1933) **** Roscoe is back in fine form in a truly crazy comedy, Shemp makes a brief silent appearance as one of the crazy relatives (wish he got more to do).
#1548-1549 'IN THE DOUGH"" (1933) *** Roscoe's final film should have been a great one, but it misfires partly because of Shemp. Racketeering Gangsters threaten baker Roscoe and his boss to pay for their protection racket.

VITAPHONE COMEDIES featuring (but not staring) SHEMP
#1559-1560  GUS SHY in ""PAUL REVERE, Jr."" (1933) * A Vitaphone Musical telling of the Paul Revere story with SHEMP briefly appearing as a stableboy.
#1561-1562  JACK HALEY in ""SALT WATER DAFFY"" (1933) *** SHEMP's first major role is in a ""Big V Comedy"", he is teamed with Jack Haley and should have gotten co-star billing. Lionel Stander makes one of his re-accuring appearances. Shemp & Jack accidentally join the Navy when running from the cops. While a joy for Stooge fans to watch, some of the gags may seem familiar as they also appear in the Stooge army comedies.
#1580-1581  GEORGE GIVOT & CHARLES JUDELS in ""HOWD' YA LIKE THAT?"" (1933) *** Another ""Big V Comedy"" in the Navy. This time SHEMP gets no screen credit, but he does get a few good minutes of screen time near the beginning as a sailor trying to sneak some liquor out on shore leave. Watch for future ""Blondie"" star Penny Singleton going by the name Dorothy McNulty here, she has no memories of doing this film. Lionel Stander also returns in this film, making it seem like a follow-up of sorts to ""Salt Water Daffy"" but with a new comedy team. If you have never heard of this comedy team, once they say ""How you like that?"" you will realize that you at least saw them drawn in a classic cartoon (usually a Warner Brothers Cartoon).

Disc #2

VITAPHONE COMEDIES featuring (but not staring) SHEMP
#1591-1592  GUS SHY in ""I SCREAM"" (1933) ***** Three Stooges fans will enjoy this ""Big V Comedy"" as there is plenty of stooging around, complete with eye-pokes & Ice Cream fights.  Gus Shy is an Ice Cream delivery man who gets hired to break up a gangster fight because he wears a uniform. Shemp has plenty to do as the number one gang member to ""The Boss"", played by Lionel Stander.
#1596  JESSE BLOCK & EVA SULLY in ""THE WRONG WRONG TRAIL"" (1933) *** this one is only 10 minutes long. ""A Vitaphone Pepperpot"" comedy. Another Insane Asylum comedy where Shemp has a brief appearance as a delivery man. The crazy jokes come at you an a fast pace.  Jesse plays an investigator looking into a mystery at the asylum. Eva plays a nurse who makes Gracie Allen (not in this comedy) look normal. No screen credits for Shemp.
#1615-1616  BEN BLUE in ""HERE COMES FLOSSIE!"" (1933) * Ben Blue, much more toned down from his annoying persona at Hal Roach Studios, shares the spotlight with Shemp in this ""Big V"" Farm comedy. Shemp orders a cow for the farm at the same time a mail-order bride arrives, who happens to be named Flossie.  Needless to say, the girl gets put in the barn and the cow gets put in the house with amusing results that would have been better in a shorter film.
#1621-1622  CHARLES JUDELS & LIONEL STANDER in ""PUGS AND KISSES"" (1933) ***** In this ""Big V Comedy"" Shemp shares the spotlight as a lazy boxing trainer to boxer Lionel Stander. This seems a bit bland compared to Shemp's Three Stooges boxing comedies. The big joke is the radio announcer who is excitedly announcing an action packed match that is not happening in the ring.
#1633-1634  HARRY GRIBBON in ""MUSHROOMS"" (1933) (no stars) --- AVOID THIS POOR 'BIG V' EXCUSE FOR A COMEDY LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!--- Harry Gibbon co-stars with Lionel Stander as a Mushroom expert who can tell the difference between mushrooms & toadstools. The only comedy happens at the 10 minute mark just before Shemp arrives, and it was originally done by Laurel & Hardy.  {Spoiler Alert: The big gag at the end is that the dog died and everyone is sick from eating poisonous toadstools.}
#1638  EDGAR BERGEN & CHARLIE McCARTHY in PURE FEUD"" (1933) *** this one is only 10 minutes long. For Bergen & McCarthy fans only as they encounter two feudin' hillbilly families. Shemp gets some screen time, mostly in the last 2 minutes, as one of the hillbilly boys at the dinner table. Shemp gets no screen credit.
#1658-1659  HARRY GRIBBON in ""CORN ON THE COP"" (1934)  **** Shemp co-stars with Harry Gibbon in this ""Big V Comedy"" as hobos with a get-rich-sceme to cure foot corns.  Shemp is in top form scheming to get customers.
#1662  ""RAMBLING 'ROUND RADIO ROW"" (1934) ** this ""Vitaphone Pepper Pot"" musical short is only 11 minutes long with little comedy. The film gives no cast credits, Bonnie Poe appears as ""Betty Boop"", and other stars of the time sing for their mail. Shemp makes a straight character role appearance as a man asking George Jessel to appear in a benefit for songwriters.
#1667-1668  BEN BLUE in ""VERY CLOSE VEINS"" (1934) ***  ""A Big V Comedy"". Ben Blue has hot-blooded veins and goes to Alaska to cure them.  Shemp appears 5 minutes in to the film as ""Sourdough"" but has little to do with the film, he vener even appears on screen with Ben Blue. It is almost as if he was added to pad out the short because it wasn't long enough, even then it only runs 18 minutes with Shemp in it..  Ben Blue over acts like a 1920's silent comic while everyone else is performing like 1930's sound movie actors.  This makes Ben stand out like a cartoon character.
#1674-1675  HARRY GRIBBON in ""ART TROUBLE""(1934) **** with JIMMY STEWART (who gets no screen credit). One of the better ""Big V Comedies"" for Shemp in this set as he & Harry use 'Checkered Paint' to paint a ship!  Jimmy Stewart's parents want him and his brother to study art in Paris, but he wants to stay in the States. When Jimmy sees Shemp & Harry painting he hires them to go to Paris in his place. Some definite pre-code humor in this 1934 film!

Star screen credits seem to be somewhat random, one wonders who decided who was the star of each film. At times Shemp has as much screen time as the ""stars"" and out shines them.

16mm film was used for the transfers, while not as nice as 35mm, they are professionally transferred so they do not look like Public Domain cheapie DVDs. Sure this could have been razor-sharp, but these rarities are perfectly acceptable.  The print of ""Salt Water Daffy"" looks a little dark at times, it could have been adjusted when transferring it to video.

The ""Editorial Review"" above states that these were Brooklyn Produced.  While Vitaphone got its start in New York, by 1930 they had a second Hollywood Studio. I believe these comedies were produced in Hollywood California.  I doubt they would have shipped ""Pete The Pup"" all the way to New York to make one picture, and then ship him back to California to continue his appearances in the Hal Roach ""Our Gang:"" comedies.
The Editorial Review also incorrectly states there are 18 comedies when there are 19.",1355875200,23,9691,4.624708624708624
