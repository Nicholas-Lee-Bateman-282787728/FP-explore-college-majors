2384092,1,B000AARKZS,"redwall ""the movie"" is nothing but a chopped up version of season one of the series. save yourself a couple of bucks and get season one instead. i was shocked that they tried to pass this off as a unique story even in the previews for season 1 they attempt to sell you on ""the movie"". it's the exact same story except with 2 hours of footage chopped out! you can't take 13 episodes of a series, squash it into 90 mins and still retain development standards and then on top of it have the gaul to charge more for this butchering! i'll calm down now but please grab season one instead and get the nearly 5 hours of story the first season deserves.",1158969600,16,645,4.209677419354839
2384093,4,B000AARKZS,"This is review is for the Redwall Movie, animated for American audiences.  Anytime a book is adapted into a movie there's bound to be changes, and this is no exception.  I challenge you to try and adapt a full-length book into a cartoon series or movie and keep it within the time and budget restrictions.  For those who are die-hard Redwall readers, the movie or the series might be a bit of a disappointment.  I have a personal rule - never expect the movie to be exactly like the book.  With this said, our family enjoyed it very much, and I believe that this was intended for a younger audience - those that don't or can't read the Redwall series for themselves.  If you want straight-up Redwall, stick to the books.  If you want an enjoyable cartoon with a heroic and noble storyline for your young children (ages 5 and up), then get this.",1140739200,19,844,4.441558441558442
2384094,5,B000AARKZS,I am excited to find the DVD for the movie Redwall. My children 9 and 6 years old have seen this on PBS channel and have fallen in love with the series of The brave mouse.  I am going to buy it for them for Christmas.,1133049600,7,217,3.717391304347826
2384095,5,B000AARKZS,"This movie pretty much sticks to the story line of the book. I think the animation was awesome. And I think the second book should have a movie made as a sequel to this.

I REALLY enjoyed this movie and recommend it for all kids (and adults, provided they still enjoy really good stuff)",1132790400,4,286,4.296296296296297
8077400,5,B000AARKZS,"I rarely consider a movie better than the book, but I thought the book Redwall could have used an editor.  By the end I was just waiting for the book to end.  The movie, on the other hand, was concise, suspenseful, full of mysticism and symbolism.  I loved it and so did the kids.  The mice were adorable, the abbey and the countryside were beautifully rendered.  I highly recommend the movie, and, if you must, read the book.",1396396800,,426,4.410256410256411
8077401,5,B000AARKZS,My nephew is a big Redwall fan and has read all the books so when I saw a movie I had to get it for him.  He loved it.  It came quickly and was so reasonable price.  I have had 10 surgeries in the last year and so all of my shopping has been online.  This was such a relief to find since I always want it to be somenthing they really want.  This was a perfect gift and he really really loved it.,1238371200,,395,3.6547619047619047
8077402,1,B000AARKZS,This is basicly 13 episodes of the tv series condensed into a 75min movie. Don't get it. Buy the complete seasons and despite the other one star review it's perfect for all ages.,1217894400,,178,4.424242424242424
8077403,5,B000AARKZS,"My 9 year old son has been talking about this movie since he was 3 years old. I kid you not! He remembered it from his Day Care that he was once in. I was so thankful to not only remember it myself but to see that it was available for purchase. I love getting my kids those little things that they have talked about for Christmas, only to think that Mom and Dad forgot. You should have seen his face...""priceless""! We have seen it several times since Christmas...go figure. (He is now asking for the Brain Jacques books for his upcoming Birthday, as he has been checking B.J's books out at the local Library since this past summer.) I read one review about the price vs. better off buying the series. I agree only if that's what you as an adult want to have in your video libraby, but not if it's not what your child wants and remembers so fondly. This movie as well as the look on my sons little face was well worth the cost...though I am certainly NOT one who would normally spend that on just 1 movie...yikes!",1200441600,,1012,4.248704663212435
8077404,5,B000AARKZS,"I liked the masterful way the characters were brought to life in the movie, though I couldn't stand the book. The characters are realistic ""people"" with adult motivations and feelings - not kiddie games or adolescent thrill seeking. It was moving at times, and the death of the old abbott is touching, and well handled, but too disturbing for little kids. When the rats attack the abbey, people get hurt, and the rats mistreat the abbott and (badger lady) Constance. Same for the scenes where the hero is held by aggressive swallows who plan to kill him, and when the mice hunt down a large snake. There is no graphic gore, or sexual innuendo, as in some kids' cartoons. It was very enjoyable - though I personally disliked the idea of a mystical blade and a ghostly inheritance within a Catholic setting, since it's not compatible theologically...but is medievally correct. If that sort of thing disturbs your sense of propriety, don't buy the movie. For a story with good morals and adventures, with realistic consequences and no gratuitous ""junk"" - DO buy the movie. Hide it from kids younger than second grade.",1185148800,,1114,4.807291666666667
8077405,5,B000AARKZS,"My entire family used to enjoy watching the Redwall series on PBS.  We were very disappointed when the show was pulled.  This movie is a compilation of scenes from the show that tell the story of Mathias and the abbey creatures.  If you love the Redwall book series, you will love the video series as well.",1180396800,,306,4.428571428571429
8077406,5,B000AARKZS,"My six-year-old selected this movie to accompany the purchase of the book. I wasn't sure it was appropriate, since it was unrated, so I watched it with him. Matthias, a young mouse, moves in to an abbey when his family is murdered by rats. He vindicates their deaths and saves the abbey with his bravery. It is similar to the stories of King Arthur and old fashioned bravery and courage. It was fantastic, and as far as violence, certainly no worse than most American fare. My son absolutely loved it, and I think listened to the book easily because it follows the story in the movie. Brian Jacques is a great story teller. My guess is that this would be PG - there's some violence. Skip the television series DVD, season one. It is just this movie, chopped into segments.",1168300800,4,772,4.521428571428571
8077407,3,B000AARKZS,"The cartoon series of Redwall comprises gallant stories of good vs. evil; of mice and moles, hedgehogs and beavers against the likes of rats and snakes and their ilk; of journeyings and coming of age; framed within a medieval yet timeless era.  There is heroism, chivalry and treachery.  The series is based on the terrific books that emanate from the fertile imagination of Brian Jacques.  The books (whose number stands now at eighteen, plus a Redwall cook book) make very good reads themselves.

Frankly I am going to pass on Redwall: the movie and buy the separate Redwall Complete Seasons 1, 2, and 3.  Apparently they contain the same episodes that aired on PBS and so thrilled our kids (mostly the boys).  The PBS series also got the boys into reading (much more than Harry Potter) and my oldest son had read a dozen Redwall books before he turned ten, and these books run 300 pages or more.

We loved the TV show so much we tried to find Redwall on DVD, but the only thing we could find was Redwall: the movie, in 1999, in Region 2, from amazon dot UK.  We didn't buy it because we were holding out for Region 1.  Plus, yes, as others have stated, Redwall: the movie doesn't begin to present the complete Season 1: it is selections of season 1 (which in its entirety runs ~260 minutes) edited to make a 75 minute movie.  (But it was the first thing of Redwall to appear on DVD.)

We did order the beautiful limited edition green hard bound version of Redwall (Book 1) from amazon dot UK, and we thought it was fantastic to hold such a pristine and great book (with terrific illustrations) in our hands, and all the way from England that.  We gave up on getting any Redwall on Region 1 DVD other than the ones we recorded from the TV.

If you notice, the Region 1 version of Redwall: the movie didn't come out until late 2005.  The same year also saw the first releases of entire episodes in Region 1 (Redwall: the siege, Redwall: Friends and Foes, which contain only four episodes each.)  Another alternative are the so-called Redwall ""Special collectors Editions, but they seem redundant now that the Complete Seasons 1-3 have been released.

Now I see that the complete Seasons 1-3 came out this year (2006) and that is what we are springing for.  Even though my older son is almost 14, he and his two younger siblings, 11 and 9 still watch our old recordings from the TV.  So  they are getting the Season 1-3 DVDs this Christmas.

So I applaud the producers of the DVDs to get Redwall on DVD and finally now on Region 1 DVD.  I am buying Complete Seasons 1-3 but not Redwall: the movie (which although it was the gallant first attempt in 1999 to put Redwall on DVD, it falls far short of the content and continuity of either the PBS series or what is available on the Seasons 1-3 discs).  Watching Redwall was a daily routine on Saturday mornings for the boys and me. As much a we tried to record all the episodes off the TV, we missed several and got repeats of some.

I am not sure if the following is on any DVD, even the Complete Seasons 1-3 discs.  But I thought I'd mention it:

The neat thing about the TV series is that each episode not only has the animated portion (about 20 minutes per episode), but at the end a four or five minute appearance by the author Brian Jacques explaining how he thought up his characters or where he got his ideas from.  Also included in this part of the show was a simple one question quiz about the series, which led into a discussion of such qualities as honor, courage, heroism, etc.  Where else these days on a Saturday morning TV ""cartoon"" are you going to find such values instilled into kids. I also appreciated the firm delineation between good and evil that the series upheld, as compared to Harry Potter, where the two seem to meld into one.  The only question I had was would monks really participate in armed battle.",1163548800,28,3879,4.433004231311707
8077408,4,B000AARKZS,"Derivative of the popular book, there are a number of things you should know about ""Redwall -- The Movie"".  First, it is not a movie meant for adults or even older teens.  With the caveat that we don't have teenagers, I would guess that the age range would be from about five to ten years of age.

Second, the animation style is not on the order of your average animae; but is better than Saturday morning fair.

Third, while the plot is derivative of the book it is simplified enough that my six y.o. daughter can not only follow it, but likes it.  It begins with scenes from the first season of the series and ends with some startling events including the death of one of the secondary characters.

Fourth, there are no 'extra' features that are really worth exploring.  [We do get spoiled, don't we:-)]  There is a section with a wordy description of the principal characters (which is of no use to young children who aren't proficient readers); and a section with movie trailers (whoopee).

Four Stars.  Graphically attractive, it has enough plot consistency that it hangs together well.  There is no bad language, but there is some violence.  Might be too intense for some younger viewers:  my sheltered four y.o. son thought it was too much; my sheltered 6 y.o. daughter was glued to it.  Nice introduction to medieval themes.",1160438400,5,1332,4.660944206008583
