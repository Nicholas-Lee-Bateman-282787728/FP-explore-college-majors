7876041,5,6304622317,"""True Stories Of The Bizarre"" isn't the original title for these films. All they did was release ""MONDO CANE"" 1&2 under a different name.
These are MONDO MOVIES!!! Classic documentaries, which actually came to theaters in the mid-1960's.
We're talkin' REAL footage from all over the world. Many different cultures and many different types of bizarre rituals.
Just to give you a small example:
Picture it.....a whole cage full of cute little puppies! The customer comes in, has a nice long look at the adorable creatures....and then points out which one he wants to EAT..the same way that we would pick out a lobster...
It's all right here, in a two-part SHOCK-U-MENTARY, which may turn your stomache, but will educate you on different parts of the world. Not everyone thinks the same.",1051401600,,784,4.946969696969697
