8296275,5,B001E4EV7O,"Wow! If you want to make a quilt with real eye appeal, try Ricky Tims kaleidoscope method. Although it looks complicated, with his clear instructions and included print material, this quilt is easier than you'd think.",1362787200,,217,5.055555555555555
8296276,4,B001E4EV7O,"I got this at another seller, there was no ""handout"" with it--maybe that's why it was $4?  Much cooler than a traditional kaleidoscope quilt, and I love the strip panels , reminds me of doing a roman stripe way back in 1993 and a colorwash trip around the world in 1998.  Directions are clear, I didn't make a quilt , but I absolutely know I could, if only I had a rich relative who would die and make me a lady of a little more leisure . I love this option of seeing the demos on DVDfor these newer techniques.  I can fast-forward through ""sew the strips in alternating directions"" and play the part about, 'cut your wedge into 5 pieces , and line them up like this"" over and over .I colored a piece of hard paper (OK pink and red and white Valentine paper with lines in various colors and widths, and used that to be sure I ""got it"" . I'm spatially impaired or something, I played with that darn thing for 40 miutes",1255305600,4,917,4.169491525423729
8296277,4,B001E4EV7O,"Love the ideas. Well and clearly presented. Excellent fold-out guide comes with it. I think most things are covered on paper in this handout.

If you like instructional videos, this is very nice. I don't know that I will ever watch it again, but I will use the handout til it falls apart. :) Well done Mr. Tims!",1243728000,3,311,4.362068965517241
