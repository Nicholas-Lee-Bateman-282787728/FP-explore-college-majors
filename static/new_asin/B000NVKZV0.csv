2784469,5,B000NVKZV0,"an amazing combination of authentic music, poetry, literature and spectacular scenery.
And the narrator is so graceful in describing; the writing is really really good!

What i loved most about it, its been videoed from the helicopter.
which gives you a VERY clear idea on how the country looks like.

Instead of some travel DVDs they show you only the good angle of the country, in Visions of Scotland, you see it ALL untouched beauty!

The names suits it too, its not a travel guide so you will not find traveling tips.

LOVED IT ...",1223078400,6,535,4.6
2784470,5,B000NVKZV0,"wonderful scenery, and having been there was very familiar with everything.
Everyone should see Scotland/",1219881600,3,105,6.066666666666666
2784471,5,B000NVKZV0,This is a beautiful and breathtaking video . Scenery was out of this world and I am extremely glad I bought it,1211155200,2,110,4.045454545454546
2784472,5,B000NVKZV0,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.

Released in '07, `Visions of Scotland' is the sixth high altitude tour in the series following `Visions of ... Greece / Italy / England / France and Germany'. As with the previous journeys the audience is whisked away far above the maddening crowd and daily concerns of life on the ground to view Scotland in all its magnificent natural beauty. Add to the visuals an haunting Celtic and regional soundtrack and soothing narration you'll begin to think you're really there!",1208131200,12,854,4.8493150684931505
2784473,5,B000NVKZV0,"This was so beautiful, but I would have loved it to be much longer!!! Couldn't get enough of that lovely country.",1203811200,8,113,4.428571428571429
2784474,5,B000NVKZV0,"Although the islands are ignored, the crisp photography, narrator with a pleasant burr and fine music make this an exceptional entry in the ""Visions of"" collection. Almost equal to ""Over Ireland,"" still the best of the fly-by films.",1186963200,19,232,5.131578947368421
2784475,4,B000NVKZV0,"This dvd has the same themes as the other ""Visions"" discs.  I didn't find the subject matter as interesting as some of the others, but that may just have been my taste in subject matter.  None the less, I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in Scotland.",1185926400,6,259,4.375
2784476,4,B000NVKZV0,"This is a beautiful flyover with good narration and a lovely score, so the missing star is for what's left out. Of course, no tour of Scotland could include everything (I spent two years of my life there, and there is much I missed), but I was so disappointed when it ended without a look at so many of Scotland's most famous places. Yes, Stirling and Edinburgh were there, and Loch Lomond, Loch Ness and a brief glimpse of Inverness... We see Bannockburn, but not Culloden. The Isle of Mull, but not Iona. Nothing of Glencoe. And nothing of the Isle of Skye, the most famous of all Scottish islands and arguably the most beautiful. Nor do we reach the far north, so there is nothing of Orkney or Shetland.  Perhaps there were rules about flying over St. Andrews, so we see the cathedral ruins at one end and the golf course at the other, but absolutely nothing of the jewel of an ancient cathedral town that lies in between.... The other enormous omission is the lack of identification (on either credits or liner notes, which were absent altogether) of the many beautiful songs underlying the narrative. These were well-chosen, in a variety of styles, and remarkably un-cliched, so that we had choral works, folk songs, classical and contemporary, well representing the range of Scotland's culture, but I'd have loved to know the names, the artists and possibly what CDs might contain them. For a Scotophile and a music lover, this is a serious omission.  I can only hope there is a Visions of Scotland, Part II, that lets us see the Scotland we missed - and maybe a companion CD, or at least a link to the artists whose music provided so much beauty and atmosphere.",1185494400,66,1668,4.6127946127946124
2784497,2,B000NVKZV0,"Its nice if you just like to see the visual of how beautiful Scotland is, but doesn't give you that much info about the people, history, etc.",1398297600,,141,4.2592592592592595
2784498,5,B000NVKZV0,Gives a lovely overview of a lovely country. There is SO much more to see but this DVD gives a good titbit!,1395446400,,107,3.909090909090909
2784499,5,B000NVKZV0,"Got the video for daughter's birthday after seeing it at a local genuine fish & chips restaurant... had to check it out to make sure it was okay... I will probably get another one for mom & dad because it is just one of those breathtaking venues scene after scene.  Thanks... worth the cost and more.

2784500,5,B000NVKZV0,"Given as a gift. Good book.i have not read book myself.
I hope to check it out later and read for myself.",1388793600,,105,3.8181818181818183
2784501,3,B000NVKZV0,One prefers a more leisurely approach to viewing scenery; this one moves along much too quickly for my taste as if hurrying to catch a train.,1388448000,,141,4.461538461538462
2784502,5,B000NVKZV0,I have purchased several of the Visions DVDs in the past. They have always produced wonderful DVDs. This one follows the same high standards. This a relaxing and enjoyable way to see a country. They hit all of the high points as well as those hard to see places or places that the average tourist fails to see. This DVD is another must have!!!,1387152000,2,343,4.375
2784503,3,B000NVKZV0,"I enjoyed this scenic flyover video of Scotland.  The narration and music are excellent.  Like other reviewers, I do wish there were other ""ground-level"" photos or footage of some of the more notable sites.",1371945600,,206,5.029411764705882
2784504,5,B000NVKZV0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd of Scotland!  The variety of old ruins and castles, along with the islands, the lakes, highlands, etc., make this a wonderful travelogue whether a view has been to Scotland or not.  The music and narration are great additions to this, and find it all very soothing, especially the bonus feature that is minus the narration.  I love seeing sights from the air, so this gives me the feeling of flying as I watch it.  I have other dvds in this Visions series, and am slowly adding to my library of them.  I wish I could travel more and go see these great sights!",1371859200,2,589,4.416666666666667
2784505,5,B000NVKZV0,"After seeing this i wish i could have been on the next plane to Scotland.
  The aerial photography is amazing. The scenery gorgeous. Music was perfect. Narration was well done.
  I would recommend this for anyone but especially for someone who's heritage this is.",1370217600,,263,4.909090909090909
2784506,4,B000NVKZV0,"this video is basically flying thru the air around selected parts of scotland.  as i was using this as a learning tool, i was surprised at what was left out.  several important sites were completely left out, and not everthing can be seen well from the air.  for the person who wants a partial view, it is fine.",1365292800,,311,4.327586206896552
2784507,3,B000NVKZV0,"Despite some truly wonderful, artistic & stunningly beautiful views with an informative and interesting narration, I was quite disappointed in this DVD.  It seemed the DVD had ambitious goals which were only partially realized before the budget expired and the production was finished in a rush.  Most of the areas depicted were beautifully presented; but, there were many significant areas and sights totally ignored -- maybe the budget ran out?  I'm not sure if the videographer had some strange fixations or if the editor found it simpler & easier (or cheaper) to have extended coverages of a ship going under a bridge and extended coverages of unidentified countryside.  While the music was pleasant -- I would have thought some Celtic music would be more appropriate for a scenic tour of Scotland.  At least the narrator had a pleasant Scottish brogue.  Most annoying was the extremely poor job of pan & scan framing -- throughout the video the location labels were chopped off.  For example, for ""Selkirk"" the label that appeared was ""kirk"" -- the first 3 letters were not visible -- the image had wide black borders on both sides.  Few (if any) of the location labels were complete.",1347494400,,1189,4.939698492462312
2784508,2,B000NVKZV0,"Too much of the video in this film focused on urban areas, no footage of the western Islands or the NW coast at all.  Not even a shot of Cape Wrath.  I also found the music to be a great annoyance.  Why in the world use Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and other incongruous non-Celtic tracks when there is a treasure-trove of beautiful music from the Gaelic -speaking parts of British Islands to choose from, much of which must be in public domain by now?  The narration was pleasant enough, but lacked any depth or real historical information.  I wasn't expecting a major documentary here, but I was expecting a lot more than I got.  Also, don't be fooled by the 88 min stated length.  Twenty-nine minutes of this is outtakes with no narration, so I feel even more ripped off.  Basically little more than insipid eye candy that is only of passing interest.  I wish I'd have skipped it altogether.",1294876800,,894,4.572327044025157
2784509,2,B000NVKZV0,"Although stunningly beautiful in a number of places, the videographer spent an odd extra amount of time filming bizarre things like a ship passing under a bridge, the same ship passing under other bridges, and the same ship passing under by under the helicopter.  Was the ""The Ship"" video?  In other areas, the videographer seems to delight in filming their landing and airport flyovers.  Not exactly what I wanted to see in a video about Scotland.  Numerous clips were used repeatedly (yeah, saw that, yep saw that already... etc) and instead of filming the countryside or town, the videographer focuses on one specific spot in a town (a tall castle, or one hill peak) so you don't get the see the rest of the town or hillside.  Narration, when it exists at all,  seems to be a complete after thought and is incomplete, boring, and tedious.  This is not what I would call a quality product and given the price, it's a definite NOT RECOMMENDED review from me.",1290470400,15,959,4.6726190476190474
2784510,4,B000NVKZV0,"Although I liked the video there are a few locations that the narration never identifies, and there are many well known islands that we never are shown. I am puzzled why Islay, Skye, Harris, etc. are never shown, especially considering how much time is spent on the major cities. Perhaps the video should have been longer, or multi-episode?",1266192000,,340,4.879310344827586
2784511,5,B000NVKZV0,"I bought this DVD to show to a church travel group. I was a little leary about showing it, as I thought the older people wouldn't like the fly-over bit. Might make them dizzy. But, they loved it! The views and music were outstanding. A lot of the people wanted to know where they could get their own personal copy of the DVD. So, I highly recommend it. A totaly different look at Scotland.",1265241600,,389,4.27027027027027
2784512,5,B000NVKZV0,"Completes our recent trip in 2008 to Edinburgh, the Highlands and Isle of Skye. Could not cover all the areas of interest in depth as only had five days to see everything. Would recommend seeing the video before taking your first trip to Scotland. Would give you a better idea of points of interest to see.",1255564800,,306,4.482142857142857
2784513,5,B000NVKZV0,"We really enjoyed this video reminder of the trip we took to Scotland a couple years ago.  Got to ""revisit"" many of our stops and see some new sights as well.  Narration was helpful without being overwhelming and music was appropriate without being cliche.",1236384000,4,256,4.795454545454546
2784514,5,B000NVKZV0,"I was trying to find something similar to Epcott's video VISIONS OF FRANCE, which was absolutely breathtaking.  This does it.  Filmed form a helicopter with a panoramic view, this series will take your breath away.  As a Professor, I use the series to get students excited about study abroad in Europe.  Mission accomplished.  College kids are a tough audience.  This will appeal to young and old alike.",1234828800,8,403,4.940298507462686
2784515,4,B000NVKZV0,"Like all the other videos in this series, you get a view from a helicoptor of all the major tourist sights in the specified country, in this case, Scotland.  Most of us have not flown in a helicoptor over a country.  So we all get a view that we cannot get from a walking or driving tour. It's well-done.  I received it as a Christmas gift and was not disappointed.  I've watched it several times and will watch it many more times in the future.",1224892800,4,445,4.2

8181788,5,B000NVKZV0,"Though I do not get to travel often, I am absolutely in love with seeing and experiencing new places, especially when it comes to visiting Europe. I have had the great privilege of visiting Ireland and England, but unfortunately I have not been able to see Scotland. That is why I love watching ""Visions of Scotland."" The movie offers me a glimpse of the amazing and beautiful sights Scotland has to offer, all in the comfort of my own home. I thing the Public Television company did a great job with this movie. The quality is wonderful. I really enjoy listening to the narrator is his native tongue talking about the various sights in his country. I have seen other ""Visions of movies, and he is definitely one of my favorite narrators (he and the narrator in the Ireland movie). I also really enjoy the music. Most of it makes you feel like you are almost living in a fairy tale. I remember getting shivers when listening to the choir of voices singing ""Loch Lomond"" while the camera focuses on the stunning views of the Highlands. If I ever get to travel again, Scotland will be the country I visit, partly because of this excellent movie. It's a film that I have watched many times, sometimes more than once in a single day, and it's something I will continue to watch for years to come.",1467763200,,1292,4.502127659574468
