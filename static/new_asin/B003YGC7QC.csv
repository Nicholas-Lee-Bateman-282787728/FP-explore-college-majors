4229063,4,B003YGC7QC,"When I first saw an advertisement for this movie on the internet I thought it looked kinda - well - dumb. How exactly do you take something like yoga and make it exciting? I suspected that the concept would be fairly shallow and that there would be too much dead weight and/or uninteresting filler material to make it an entertaining film. In addition, I had reservations about what kind of horror sequences could possibly be implemented. Needless to say, I skipped out on a blind buy for a while but eventually took the plunge when curiosity got the best of me. Most fortunately, ""Yoga Institute"" (2009) turned out to be an enjoyable horror film.

The way it does this is to implement a very interesting main theme: vanity and the striving for perfect beauty. In some ways ""Yoga"" is similar to films like ""Dumplings"" (2004) and ""Time"" (2006) because of their shared amalgamation of vanity and horror, as well as their common focus on communicating the lengths to which some will go to obtain beauty. Of course, the protagonists in ""Yoga"" are not quite as crazy as the characters in the aforementioned films, but they do have their moments of instability within the confines of the privately owned institute that they visit to perform their week-long series of intense yoga training. While none of these characters are especially complex, they are sufficiently developed to earn the viewer's interest.

Another important scriptwriting decision that makes ""Yoga"" more interesting than it should be is the introduction of a form of witchcraft. This witchcraft element is shown in more of a subtle manner than one might expect because it's not explicitly referenced at any point, yet is clearly the cause behind the beautification process as well as the nasty ramifications that befall those characters who do not follow the strict guidelines and rules laid forth by the institute's madam. This, of course, leads to some cool horror sequences that completely avoid most genre clichs like ghost girls, human-inflicted torture, and loud jump scares. There's ample use of creepy sound effects (like snake noises) and chanting to give a sinister vibe. The witchcraft angle just seems like a great decision by the filmmakers because it allows the film to breath life into the whole yoga premise.

With regards to the production quality, ""Yoga"" is what we've come to expect from the South Korean film industry. The yoga institute itself is a private mansion with very elegant architecture and spooky interior designs that add a lot to the visuals and atmosphere. The acting is solid for the most part and the camera-work is first-class (especially those close shots of hot girls twisting their bodies in all kinds of dubious positions).

The ending is a bit of a mind-boggler, but those looking for something different and fun might want to check ""Yoga"" out.",1283904000,7,2849,4.966457023060797

8409177,3,B003YGC7QC,"This one was a summer horror theatrical release in Korea. Originally internationally titled ""Yoga School,"" this stars Kim Eugene (formerly of popular singing group SES). The rest of the lovely female cast includes Park Han-byul, Cha Soo-yeon, Jo Eun-ji, Kim Hye-na, and Hwang Seung-uhn. Like with Ogamdo, the poster for this movie caused quite a buzz that preceded the film's opening. The eerie, photo-manipulated image features Lee Young-jin, who plays the school's specter-like founder, with a tagline that reads, ""Do you also want to be pretty?""",1441756800,,548,5.383720930232558
8409178,4,B003YGC7QC,"My husband and I had seen this movie as a preview and so I ordered it. It was a good movie, but the preview made it look more exciting, on the edge of your seat type of movie. It was interesting and we've watched it more than a couple of times and it does keep you guessing on what's going to happen next.",1411516800,,305,3.857142857142857
8409179,4,B003YGC7QC,"Question: What do you get when you cross the Eagle's song/lyrics ""Hotel California"" and a yoga studio?

Answer: The movie Yoga: Mind, Body and Tortured Souls.

Well, kinda.

In Yoga: Mind, Body and Tortured Souls vanity is the insanity that's going on here - the competitive vanity of anyone looking to be perfectly pretty or attractive in this world - thinking that this worldly possession will make them truly happy and eternally satisfied, better than someone else - the outward flesh giving them the power and love they want. The problem here with these women is that their concept of beauty is mercenary, grasping and close-fisted. Of course real yoga has nothing to do with this kind of thing - but here in this movie, where wounded searching souls come looking for answers down this false path of so called ""yoga"" things are not what they seem. Real yoga is like real beauty - is open and free, non-competitive.

This dark supernatural cautionary tale of envious/commercial vanity and your soul packs a formidable and frightful punch.

Not rated, but some language, no sex or nudity, has some scarey and or bloody images - so PG-13 or R?",1388620800,,1144,4.786802030456853
8409180,3,B003YGC7QC,"This is a rare category. A Korean chick-flick by a chick director with an all-chick (primary) caste. I felt left out. A lot of what transpires is female-oriented.

...and I'm not being sarcastic here....

The film is never as scary as it wants to be. Actually it is never scary or rewarding overtly to me, but I guess to some it apparently is, judging by Reviews. It seems to be mainly concerned with female youth, beauty, acceptance, envy, duplicity (the double-cross), and success in a consumer-society.

While the acting (as always in most Korean films) is stunning and brilliant, the director has filmed this work in what I will call Relentless Shadow Vision---or constantly dark, dull, and claustrophobic. This director shows flashes of raw power and control in framing and picking certain shots, but, sadly, it does not predominate this work. Also, some of it is just cinematically trite or already been used a zillion times.

...okay, so maybe my German Pinscher puppy did interrupt me about 137 times but I think there are plot points missing here or just not explained. Such as: exactly What is the exact deal going on with the yoga-school propriator's eternal beauty, why was the director (in the movie) killed, and the beauty-girl and the Tv girl (i'll avoid a few spoilers here), and a few other things.

...okay so the puppy interrupted me 392 times in a half hour, but I still think the plot needs clarification, especially as a detective (me), I need facts :)

This film is kind of:  Yoga Meets Voodoo Meets the Exorcist Meets Envious Betrayal.

I do recommend it for some, and-or maybe  those interested in such paranormal horror phenomena; you will be rewarded, I am sure. It's a heartfelt, carefully crafted, stunning work.

( I hate it when the puppy hurls herself at the door, whines and screams that she totally MUST go out NOW or the world is doomed, and then she just stands there on the patio and just stares at the bushes or something. And she did the 432 times in 15 minutes.... )",1374364800,,2006,4.7057142857142855
8409181,5,B003YGC7QC,I chose this rating because this has become one of my favorite foreign horror movies. I really liked the story and the cast. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie fans. I am really pleased with my purchase.,1360281600,,217,4.45
8409182,4,B003YGC7QC,"Vain women get together in a crazy house that promises the secret of beauty through yoga. The headmistress puts them through a nightmare week of hell and rules that they all end up breaking because they're knuckleheads. It's very boring at first, but hits you in the face with insanity about halfway through. It can be incoherent and implausible from start to finish but that's fine because I've just come to expect that from K-horror. This is definitely one of my favorites in the genre.",1345248000,,488,4.752941176470588
8409183,5,B003YGC7QC,"In a good way.  I honestly really loved this movie and the story went quit well.  But with many korian movies and such the endings always make you say ""what?...""  I was confused at what the heck happened.  Maby if they added extra bonus material it would have shed some light but I do recomend this movie.",1322438400,2,305,4.298245614035087
8409184,3,B003YGC7QC,"Yoga is about a young woman,Hyo-jung, who works for a TV network making commercials for lingerie. Hyo-jung is also drawn between the love she feels for her kind but poor boyfriend and social pressure from her friends to marry a rich man. One day our hero is kicked from her job as the network have found a model to take her place and then the cute but normal looking Hyo-jung just is not pretty enough. In desperation to attain perfect beauty Hyo-jung takes the advice of a strange friend to sign up at a mysterious underground Yoga academy, several other girls sign up at the same time, each of whom have their own reasons for seeking perfection, and the girls are promised the chance for eternal youth and perfect beauty if they complete the course, however mysterious and frightening things soon start happening at the academy.

Yoga begins great, it is atmospheric, have some good acting and it it both traditional enough to give you that good feeling of anticipation over sitting down with a good Asian horror flick, and it is different enough to feel original, the story movies around nicely and half way through this movie I was really impressed, then however all went to the hounds. I am not sure what happened if the producers went out of money or what but the last part of Yoga is confusing and sloppy, the ending is anti climatic and unsatisfying and allot of elements are just left hanging, like for example Hyo-jung boyfriend, we never get to see what happens to him. Also the final explanation of what is going on is very confusing and all in all the end of this movie just felt rushed.

I give Yoga plus for originality, I also really enjoyed the first part of this film, the visuals are good, especially the Yoga studio who seam both creepy and serene at the same time, the actors do a good job, and the characters are pretty decent, I particularly enjoyed Nani the evil Yoga instructor. I also give this movie a plus for having an evil Yoga instructor, how many movies have that? :P However the last part of Yoga sort of ruins the film so I can not really recommend it. Good start, stunning visuals but sloppy ending.",1312675200,,2134,4.54025974025974
8409185,1,B003YGC7QC,This has to be one of the dumbest movies yet.  Don't waste your money on this crap.  A two-year old could have made a better movie.  The only reason I gave it one star is because it would not let me give it no stars.,1309651200,,216,3.7555555555555555
