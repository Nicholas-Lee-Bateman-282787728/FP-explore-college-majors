It is horrible to ruin a fun old school film by adding CGI.  Luckily there is a great restored version of the original film here as well, but this price is way too high.  Otherwise, if you grew up on rubber suit monster movies, you'll have some fun here.",1521590400,5,396,4.038461538461538

For anyone who does purchase This item, it will play in your computer. I hooked an HDMI cord from computer to TV. This is the only way I've been able to watch it. Otherwise great movie.",1464307200,3,299,3.918032786885246

Excellent action-horror flick. That ending was, wonderfully, unexpected. Remember that THIS is the
NEWLY-RELEASED version of a great EVIL-Bigfoot monster... with practical-F/X with and actual 6'8'

HIGHLY recommended!",1530662400,,233,6.8
8658003,5,B00KE2BWM4,"I favorite Bigfoot movie, hands down. The cast is great, the look, the feel. It's what I would call ""a great couch movie"". Never seen anything quite like it really. A must watch for horror and Bigfoot fans alike. However, do yourself a favor and watch it late at night... trust me... PS: I went to a signing at Dark Delicacies to get the poster signed, it does not come signed in the case.",1530489600,,389,4.27027027027027

8658005,5,B00KE2BWM4,"The search for Bigfoot has increased over the past few years, in part fueled by the series FINDING BIGFOOT. Combined with previous efforts to find the elusive beast weve seen how groups of people have banded together to search for this creature. But before all of that there were movies being made about not just the search but encounters with Bigfoot or creatures like them. One of the most famous was THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK which fueled the films of its producer/director Charles B. Pierce. Another was the schlock drive in classic SHRIEK OF THE MUTILATED. But one that rarely gets the attention it deserves is ABOMINABLE.

Made in 2006 on a minor budget the film didn't play many theaters but became a hit on cable TV. I can remember it airing to little fanfare but after watching it I was stunned. The movie is far better than one would expect.

Matt McCoy stars as Preston Rogers, a well off young man who lost his wife during a mountain climbing accident a year earlier that left him bound to a wheelchair. His doctor feels that the best thing for him to do to get over the sadness and guilt he still feels for his wifes death is to send him back to the cabin they shared near the mountain she fell from. Accompanied by a less than sympathetic nurse named Otis (Christien Tinsley who also helped with the creature effects) they reach their destination. Having forgotten a few supplies Otis leaves Preston behind in the cabin for the short trip to town.

While hes gone new neighbors in the cabin next door arrive, a group of young women out to celebrate the impending wedding of one of their group. Preston hears them arrive, stereo blaring and watches as they unload and go into their cabin. Hes later caught looking at them through binoculars making them assume hes a peeping tom. Looking into the woods hes stunned to see a pair of red eyes looking back at him, bumps his chair and is knocked unconscious.

After a nap Preston wakes wondering why Otis hasn't returned. Looking outside he sees a telephone pole blocking the road. Attempting to alert the girls next door they assume hes doing more window watching and ignore him. One of the girls goes out to use her cell phone and after looking away for a moment, Preston sees shes disappeared and her cell phone is laying on the ground.

A side note has three friends in the woods attempting to track down the best that killed the dog belonging to one of them during a short opening segment. As they do so they hear something in the woods. As one of them tracks it down, he finds the first missing girl as well as the beast, hightailing it back to the campfire and more fire power. But the odds of their surviving are slim.

Unable to get to their cabin because of his condition Preston is helpless to do anything but watch as the beast attacks and abducts another girl which the rest later discover. He yells to them and attempts to get them to his cabin but the beast attacks again. Not all will make it but one does. Now Preston and the girl must do what they can to survive before the beast returns.

Director Ryan Schifrin does an amazing job of telling the story using glimpses of the creature throughout the film but finally delivering with some great looking special effects to allow the viewers to see the creature full on. This doesnt cheat the viewer with a movie that never shows the monster in question but is used sparingly leaving you wanting more. He builds the tension nicely here, forcing the viewer to feel concern for Preston who is unable to do much confined to his wheelchair but not giving in at the same time.

While watching I kept thinking that the film felt like a combination of Alfred Hitchcocks REAR WINDOW melded with a Bigfoot film. I was pleased to find that this was what Schifrin was going for in the extras as he talked about the film. It does so in such a way as to not be a rip off of the classic film but putting its own twist on the idea and it works marvelously.

The acting is something that could have killed this movie. In the hands of terrible actors the movie would have been difficult to watch. Not to worry. McCoy does a fantastic job. Having seen him before I often wondered why he was never a much bigger star than he was. Haley Joel as Amanda, the girl that makes it to his cabin, also turns in a great performance. Her character isn't the standard dumb blonde bimbo here but someone capable of helping Preston as the two of them face off against the monster. Familiar faces to horror fans will be found here as well. Dee Wallace and Rex Linn are the wife and farmer attacked in the opening sequence, Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen are the two friend accompanying Linn when they go searching for the monster, Paul Gleason and Phil Morris are the sheriff and deputy respectfully going to check on things and Tiffany Shepis is on hand to do what she does best which is be a scream queen.

Without giving it away or supplying any clues one more thing needs noted and thats the ending of the film. Where some movies on the subject leave you hanging or completely cheat you (as in WILLOW CREEK which I found to be a major disappointment) this one delivers what I think is one of the greatest endings of a horror film in some time. Enough so that I found myself smiling before the end credits began rolling.

MVD is releasing this film as part of their MVD Rewind collection, complete with old mom and pop video store packaging. Not only that they're releasing it with a brand-New 2K High-Definition transfer from the original camera negative giving it the greatest looking picture possible on screen. Extras are plentiful here with an audio commentary track with Schifrin, McCoy and Combs, an introduction by Schifrin, BACK TO GENRE: MAKING ABOMINABLE a featurette on the making of the movie, deleted scenes and extended scenes, outtakes and bloopers, SHADOWS Schifrins USC student film, BASIL & MOBIUS: NO REST FOR THE WICKED a short film written and directed by Schifrin with a score by his famous father Lalo Schifrin, the original 2005 version of the film, an improved version of the film with some minor alterations, the original theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, a storyboard gallery and a collectible poster.

This is a must have movie for both Bigfoot fans and horror fans. It delivers on all levels. Even fans of suspense films will want to make a point of watching this one. I know for myself I plan to keep this one handy so I can enjoy it again in the near future. I truly enjoyed it and cant recommend it enough.",1529798400,2,6550,4.508845829823083
