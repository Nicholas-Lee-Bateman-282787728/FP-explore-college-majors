3495184,5,B001BN4WMC,This season is so much better than season 4! I just wish the seasons would come out faster so I can get caught up quicker!,1227052800,,122,3.92
3495185,5,B001BN4WMC,"The fifth season of The L Word was probably my second favorite aside from the first season. I loved Jenny's character in this season. She became even more outrageous but I thought she was funny and cute at the same time. The idea of watching them make her book into a movie was great! Because she finally got her book published and now having studios fighting over the rights to her movie...her spoiled girl act was my favorites of all. I don't want to give away any spoilers but I can't believe what Adele did! There's that saying: always watch out for the quiet ones and wow, is that true in this case. The only thing I didn't care for was having Marlie Matlin back in this season. For some reason, I thought she was leaving after the end of the fourth season. I miss Kristanna Loken, who played Shane's love interest in season 4. But Shane is Shane, as I noticed at the end of seasons 3, 4 and 5. But as a Jenny fan, I really liked this season. Even after watching a week's episode, I couldn't help watching the repeat of it, which was right after. Lot of good things were in this season but if you're a Jenny fan, I think you'll really love it!! Did I mention I liked Jenny?",1220140800,25,1178,4.24
3495186,5,B001BN4WMC,"I'm a huge Tibette fan!! I never seen any other actors/actresses who have the best chemistry on screen, like JB and LuH. So after all the drama, the heartache, FINALLY my favorite coupLe in the show are BACK TOGETHER! And hope this time it'll stick! Lots of Laughter this season which I Love! and much more Tibette's Love this season as well! I can't wait to own this DVD! Most importantly, can't wait for the new season, which sadly would be the Last one. I don't know what I'd do when the show ended, although there will be a spin-off, but still don't know which character. Love the L word! :)",1217030400,29,595,4.36936936936937

3495367,2,B001BN4WMC,"I'm only half way thru the season and I'm not sure if Jenny committed suicide or if some one murdered her yet. With that said, I've wanted to murder her since the second episode of season one. LOL  She's been the most annoying character on any show, ever. I wish this would have happened in season one.
This season was just weird. It didn't seem to fit the rest of the series at all. I'm going to finish the season because, well, I've already watched the whole series so I might as well just finish it but I'm disappointed with the finale season so far.",1470700800,,553,4.266666666666667

8283643,3,B001BN4WMC,"Demonstrates via the instability of relationships between devout lesbians a key insight about the homosexual regimentation structures inflicted on young people below and just beyond age of consent.  With daily homosexual assaults in so called ""physical education"" courses in secondary schools, with mandatory same gender bedroom partners in colleges and universities defrauding students of any place to study, and with unConstitutional prosecutions of adult hetero relationships, malicious homosexuals endeavor to regiment humans into their prepubescent retard heterophobic malfunctions.  The ""lack of tolerance"" discussed at length in various episodes of ""The L Word"" is rooted not in voluntary choice but in the criminal imposition of homosexuality onto NONCONSENTING youth and elders which generates righteous indignation against the oppressors.",1499040000,,848,6.239316239316239
