8075673,4,B000A7DW30,I enjoy anything that warns me about schemes that are designed to hurt me. Self defense is important and this documentary is good because it exposes the con tricks so that we can be prevented from becoming victims.,1439164800,,214,4.657894736842105

This dvd is worth every penny and your time, it exposes tons of cons and scams that you can detect and avoid. I view this dvd as an investment in how not to get hustled.",1406160000,,308,3.796875
8075676,1,B000A7DW30,"i ordered like 15 different things and the stuff from this seller came the quickest,, so i was happy about that, but the video stopped working about 60percent into it and i accidentally ordered 2 of them and they both did. The stuff was very outdated for the most part, technology is way better now and you couldn't do alot of the things good. The seller was fast, but the movie was outdated. Also i noticed how one person will sell something at 5 different prices. I noticed that when i got 2 things. I looked into it and one person might sell something at 5 different prices",1405382400,,576,4.342592592592593
