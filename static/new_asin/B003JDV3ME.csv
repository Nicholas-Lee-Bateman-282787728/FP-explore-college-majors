8695487,5,B003JDV3ME,"The story is about a girl name Kaoru, who has a condition known as XP and therefore can't be exposed to sunlight. Her only way of seeing the outside world is through her bedroom window where she can see thd beach. Her friend captures the outside world with her video camera and let Kaoru view it during night. The story revolves mainly around Kaoru and Kouji who both had dreams but is difficult to realize it due to life's circumstance. Together they form a music band to achieve their dream, but tragedy struck before they could accomplish it.
A Song to the Sun is a great drama and is recommended to those who love a good drama. The reason I bought this drama was because of the title. I promise you won't be disappointed.",1368576000,,725,4.417910447761194
8695488,5,B003JDV3ME,"Be careful as you buy this as it is NOT ""Ima, Ai ni yukimasu""('''''''''), this is ""A song to the sun"" (Taiyou no Uta - ''''''').

Great drama anyway, probably the best with '''''''.",1281830400,,181,4.323529411764706
