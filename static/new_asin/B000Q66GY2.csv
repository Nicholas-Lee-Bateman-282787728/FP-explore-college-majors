8194159,3,B000Q66GY2,"I was interested in this one because I'd read Suvorov's books, including that of (almost) the same title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Aquarium-The-Making-Soviet/dp/0026154900/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Aquarium The Making Soviet</a>&nbsp;.

Good points:
- The movie follows the book's narrative reasonably closely, with some writing recognizably word-for-word from the book.
- Interesting watching Soviet-era equipment used the way it was being used in ""the old (Cold War) days"".

Not-so-good points:
- I understand next to no Russian, but it was a bit odd hearing the dialogue in what appears to be Polish (a lot of the words the English subtitles said were being said didn't click with the words coming out of the Soviets' mouths).
- English subtitles needed work (spelling errors, grammar).
- Acting was a bit clunky, less than dazzling.

Bottom line:  nice to have in my war film collection, follows the book reasonably closely, but not spectacularly executed.",1386720000,,1024,6.041379310344827
8194160,4,B000Q66GY2,"This film is well acted, and follows closely the account in the book from which it was derived.  It has an authenticity which shames the most popular spy-story writers.  This is the real thing; and although the Cold War is over, I have no doubt that the same sorts of people, and the same organization is alive and well in Putin's Russia.  This story tells how it all works, from the agent's viewpoint.

In watching the movie, I had the same feeling that the book engendered: what do these men get out of being in such an organization as the GRU?  It takes over one's whole life, and as new recruits are plainly told, there is no leaving except through the crematorium chimney.  If you really understand what is going on in the story, you will feel chilled to the soul -- but I fear that most Western viewers may miss the point.  They may be looking for more explosive action.  There is some physical roughness in this movie, but the real brutality is to the spirit.

The acting is excellent, and includes Janusz Gajos and others of some of the most popular actors in Poland.  The English subtitles are rather good.",1231977600,6,1115,4.475247524752476
8194161,3,B000Q66GY2,"I have stumbled across this movie in my library.  It is a true story about the secret Russian intelligence group called GRU.  This was elite espionage group in competition for the information gathering business with KGB.  Its members are young middle class Russian men, indoctrinated in believing that USSR is superior to other countries and parts of the world.  In their patriotic fervor to serve their country, these young men find themselves in western Europe recruiting western engineers, scientists and small business owners to sell them information about the latest technology developed by the military and private business.  This is a true story of the young Russian spy who over time realises that he is dispensable to GRU and in order to save his life, he turns himself over to the British.  Sentenced to death in absence by USSR courts, this spy is hidden in the west where he is protected by the British secret police and writes books while in undisclosed exile.  If you are fan of the Polish film, you will recognize some of the better known Polish actors.",1205107200,5,1068,4.867403314917127
