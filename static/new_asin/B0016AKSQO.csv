3154978,5,B0016AKSQO,"I loved this film from the get-go. It's a wittily crafted set of intertwining love stories, as well as a sly commentary on modern life. The vistas of Paris are wonderfully shot and give a great sense of being in the city. I thought the acting was quite good.

I agree with the reviewer ""Charlus"" that at very first listen, the music may come across to some as not all that distinctive, but if you like musicals to any degree at all, and you essentially like pop music, you will probably find that the music stays in your head, and it grows on you. Also, if you speak French as I do, you'll appreciate the music all the more, because the lyrics are very clever and well-written. It's the English subtitles that are often a bit unfortunately and inaccurately translated, IMO. At least to some degree, I suppose this was done for the sake of maintaining rhyme in the subtitles. Too bad this DVD is not yet available in the States... there must be legal issues that are being worked out with regard to rights and such, because it makes no sense, as this movie fills a very distinctive niche and has something of a cult following. It has been shown in art house cinemas all over the country, even in places like Montgomery, Ala. So I'm sure it will eventually be released here.

3155028,3,B0016AKSQO,"""Love Songs"" is not what it might seem by glancing at the cover: a light-hearted musical about three young adults in love in Paris, enjoying a relationship that is more of a menage-a-trois than a love triangle.  The movie takes a dark turn, and ends up exploring more types of love and more of the different emotions that love inspires than what is apparent at first glance.

""Love Songs"" is a star turn for Louis Garrel, and he does an admirable job as Ismael.  It helps that he is a beautiful man and a talented actor, as is especially demonstrated in two scenes where he plays parlor games (charades and puppeteering) for an amused audience that show off his expressive range.  His character Ismael gets put through an emotional wringer as in a fairly short order of time he experiences a wide variety of different types of loving relationships, from the casual to the committed, with a variety of different people.  Louis Garrel performs the role admirably, but one of the shortcomings of the movie is that it tries to do too much:  any one of Ismael's relationships could have generated its own movie.  Or maybe that is the point, at the end of the day: that is just the way that life is for young adults in the City of Light.

Ludivine Sagnier fans, of which I am most definitely one, will be a bit disappointed with ""Love Songs"", as the film definitely belongs to Garrel, not Sagnier.  Sagnier's is a supporting role, and one which requires her to look wan and disinterested at a critical juncture, which does not play to her strength as a vibrant fun-loving woman.  Clotilde Hesme is given a more carefree, impish role, and she does a fine job with it.

Director Christophe Honore does several things very well: the backdrop of Paris, especially the street scenes, makes the viewers feel as though they've been transported there;  and the conclusion of the nightclub scene, which features several freeze-frames while the sound continues, is an emotionally touching way of conveying what is happening.  But at the end I think that ""Love Songs"" tries to do a bit too much, and could have been better if it had reduced the scope of the plot.  But again, maybe that is the point the film is trying to make about love:  it's complicated.",1351987200,5,2240,4.635443037974683

3155030,4,B0016AKSQO,"I won't bore you with the summary because you can find that on IMDB and Wikipedia. I will review the DVD. I was expecting at least some behind the scenes process or making-of for the songs, or even a small segment of interviews and/or commentaries, but there's no extra at all. This DVD only has the movie in it. And although I truly love the film and the songs, it would have been a better DVD if it had extras included.",1307145600,,421,4.209876543209877
3155031,3,B0016AKSQO,"I expected a little more from the movie, but in the end you see the changes in the story were necessary and you like it. The music is great and contagious. Don't have many ""homoerotic scenes"". Despite everything, there is Louis Garrel, which certainly is an actor you should check.",1304985600,,281,4.64
3155052,4,B0016AKSQO,"Jean Renoir's, 54`s ""French Cancan"" is a bomb along with Jacques Demy`s, 64' ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg""(The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). Thanks to Michel Legrand's beautiful score makes ""Umbrellas"" it slow and boring. Strangely enough, it is watch over & over again because of Catherine Deneuve & the wonderful cinematography.

Gene Kelly helps but, Jacques Demy & Agns Varda`s, 67' ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"" (The Young Girls of Rochefort) is a bomb as well.

Alain Resnais, 1997 ""On Connat la Chanson"" (Same Old Song), because of songs sung by Piaf, Aznavour, Josephine Baker and others (the cream of the crop of the ""Golden Age"" of French popular music) made it delightful, but still....

In short, the French can't make musicals. But then they very rarely do, thank goodness.

Christophe Honor, ""Les Chansons d'Amour"" (Love songs) is compared to Umbrellas of Cherbourg. (Why the ""Film World"" rate ""Umbrellas"" as a great film, is beyond me.)

This Low-budget film encompasses so many clichs in French film, such as the mnage  trois scenario in the beginning of the film, as well as many other setups recognizable by French Film buffs is overridden by the plot. The performances, Alex Beaupain's music, the pace of storyline, the sudden unexpected twist in the plot(shocking)and the last lines of the film, leave the viewer stunned.

At last, the French have learned how to make a musical!",1296604800,2,1394,5.087719298245614
3155053,5,B0016AKSQO,"I caught this film one night on the IFC and although I usually dislike subtitled movies because I get distracted from the action by having to read....I watched it and WOW. The French really know how to make a musical in the non-conformist way. Songs are blended into scenes as casually as breathing and the plots and subplots of each characters stories just weave into each other in a playful way. All of the actors do their own songs in whatever voice they have which gives a ""realness"" to it and the twists in the story are interesting.
It's a case of boy meets girl meets girl till death us do part and then everyone realizes what boy really wants.
If you like cine-art type films and are not going to roll your eyes when the characters calmly start singing their lines and threesomes, homosexuality and bisexuality don't freak you out...then by all means buy this film to add to your collection. I did after viewing on cable and I love it!",1285459200,14,943,4.488372093023256

A love triangle - sadness and love are the main theme of the movie
Great Paris shots - color and black and white - the streets - cafes - cigarettes .............. you are transported in Paris by nights most of the time.
It is the photography and musicality that makes this movie a piece of art - sometimes compared to the ""parapluies de cherbourg"" because of the songs styles - but for the rest we are in 2008 and deep in it.

The music is beautiful, particularly the song about the Bastille, sung by Sagnier's character and her family in an opening scene.  The even smaller roles of the family members are exquisite.  I particularly felt for Mastroianni's character (spelling?)... please watch this film if you are a fan of french cinema, and want to escape reality for some bittersweet Parisian confection.",1229040000,6,595,5.103092783505154

3389525,3,B0016AKSQO,"""Love Songs"" is not what it might seem by glancing at the cover: a light-hearted musical about three young adults in love in Paris, enjoying a relationship that is more of a menage-a-trois than a love triangle.  The movie takes a dark turn, and ends up exploring more types of love and more of the different emotions that love inspires than what is apparent at first glance.

""Love Songs"" is a star turn for Louis Garrel, and he does an admirable job as Ismael.  It helps that he is a beautiful man and a talented actor, as is especially demonstrated in two scenes where he plays parlor games (charades and puppeteering) for an amused audience that show off his expressive range.  His character Ismael gets put through an emotional wringer as in a fairly short order of time he experiences a wide variety of different types of loving relationships, from the casual to the committed, with a variety of different people.  Louis Garrel performs the role admirably, but one of the shortcomings of the movie is that it tries to do too much:  any one of Ismael's relationships could have generated its own movie.  Or maybe that is the point, at the end of the day: that is just the way that life is for young adults in the City of Light.

Ludivine Sagnier fans, of which I am most definitely one, will be a bit disappointed with ""Love Songs"", as the film definitely belongs to Garrel, not Sagnier.  Sagnier's is a supporting role, and one which requires her to look wan and disinterested at a critical juncture, which does not play to her strength as a vibrant fun-loving woman.  Clotilde Hesme is given a more carefree, impish role, and she does a fine job with it.

Director Christophe Honore does several things very well: the backdrop of Paris, especially the street scenes, makes the viewers feel as though they've been transported there;  and the conclusion of the nightclub scene, which features several freeze-frames while the sound continues, is an emotionally touching way of conveying what is happening.  But at the end I think that ""Love Songs"" tries to do a bit too much, and could have been better if it had reduced the scope of the plot.  But again, maybe that is the point the film is trying to make about love:  it's complicated.",1351987200,5,2240,4.635443037974683

I was expecting at least some behind the scenes process or making-of for the songs, or even a small segment of interviews and/or commentaries, but there's no extra at all. This DVD only has the movie in it. And although I truly love the film and the songs, it would have been a better DVD if it had extras included.",1307145600,,421,4.209876543209877

3389549,4,B0016AKSQO,"Jean Renoir's, 54`s ""French Cancan"" is a bomb along with Jacques Demy`s, 64' ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg""(The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). Thanks to Michel Legrand's beautiful score makes ""Umbrellas"" it slow and boring. Strangely enough, it is watch over & over again because of Catherine Deneuve & the wonderful cinematography.

Gene Kelly helps but, Jacques Demy & Agns Varda`s, 67' ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"" (The Young Girls of Rochefort) is a bomb as well.

Alain Resnais, 1997 ""On Connat la Chanson"" (Same Old Song), because of songs sung by Piaf, Aznavour, Josephine Baker and others (the cream of the crop of the ""Golden Age"" of French popular music) made it delightful, but still....

In short, the French can't make musicals. But then they very rarely do, thank goodness.

Christophe Honor, ""Les Chansons d'Amour"" (Love songs) is compared to Umbrellas of Cherbourg. (Why the ""Film World"" rate ""Umbrellas"" as a great film, is beyond me.)

This Low-budget film encompasses so many clichs in French film, such as the mnage  trois scenario in the beginning of the film, as well as many other setups recognizable by French Film buffs is overridden by the plot. The performances, Alex Beaupain's music, the pace of storyline, the sudden unexpected twist in the plot(shocking)and the last lines of the film, leave the viewer stunned.

At last, the French have learned how to make a musical!",1296604800,2,1394,5.087719298245614
3389550,5,B0016AKSQO,"I caught this film one night on the IFC and although I usually dislike subtitled movies because I get distracted from the action by having to read....I watched it and WOW. The French really know how to make a musical in the non-conformist way. Songs are blended into scenes as casually as breathing and the plots and subplots of each characters stories just weave into each other in a playful way. All of the actors do their own songs in whatever voice they have which gives a ""realness"" to it and the twists in the story are interesting.
It's a case of boy meets girl meets girl till death us do part and then everyone realizes what boy really wants.
If you like cine-art type films and are not going to roll your eyes when the characters calmly start singing their lines and threesomes, homosexuality and bisexuality don't freak you out...then by all means buy this film to add to your collection.
