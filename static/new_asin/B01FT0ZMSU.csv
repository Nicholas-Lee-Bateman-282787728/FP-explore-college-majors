7751815,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"I'd put off seeing this film thinking it wouldn't appeal to me.  I was wrong.  Lovely film.  Nice acting and writing.  Beautiful cherry blossoms.  Sweet plot.  A little long, and slow, but worth watching.",1472428800,4,204,4.852941176470588
7751816,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"I watched this movie last night, I was gladly surprise, rarely you can find good movies to watch. This movie moves slowly. I don't like to spoil movies even to myself sometimes I don't read the sypnosis so I can surprise myself like with this one. It shows you the relationship between an old lady, a middle age man and a teenager. I eat aduki beans so that was a plus for me, even though I have never tasted them sweet. Also it has these amazing trees in blossom. It is a Japanese movie with English subtitles.
If you like foreign movies then this is for you.",1471910400,6,560,4.242990654205608
7751817,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"We didn't get this one on Amazon, but got the DVD from Netflix. This is an astoundingly good foreign film, in my opinion. It is a story about a little old, sweet lady that has had a lifetime of dealing with leprosy in postwar Japan. She introduces herself to a down-on-his-luck guy who is trying to repay a debt to people who helped him. The movie involves only a handful of characters, but it kept my attention from the very start. The language is Japanese, but I could have sworn it was English, as the captions were timed perfectly. Again, not a shoot-em-up, but a movie definitely worth seeing.",1471564800,12,598,4.495412844036697
7751818,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"A very Japanese-y film, quietly exploring the relations between people and between generations. In some ways it reminded us of Yasujiro Ozu's classic Tokyo Story. American audiences may find it a bit slow-moving, but it's worth watching if only for the beautiful cinematograpy of the cherry blossoms in spring. And the dorayaki looked so delicious that we're going to see if we an find a Japanese restaurant nearby that serves them.",1470960000,6,432,5.098591549295775

7751832,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"Very intimately Japanese: simple, heartwarming dynamics. The Japanese love and respect for the simple things of nature was an additional bonus. However, I didn't know whether  it didn't come with English subtitles or I just simply didn't know how to turn them on. My Japanese is diffidently good that I was able to develop a thin framework of the plot, but. Sadly, I missed a lot.",1482710400,2,380,4.757575757575758

7751834,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"Sweet Bean (an /).  Dorayaki Drama.

Rating = ****
Director:  Naomi Kawase
Producers:  Yoshito Ohyama et al.
Streaming
2015

Film = barely four (4) stars;  makeup/prosthetics = 4.5 stars; subtitles = four (4) stars; cinematography/lighting = three (3) stars.  Director Naomi Kawase's multi-generational tale of cultural isolation and neglect, food preparation in a one-product mini pastry shop, and the viral nature of rumors (both positive and negative) and their impacts on small local businesses as well as landlord greed is a highly original mash up and compelling to watch.  (Dorayaki are traditional washoku [Japanese food] consisting of small pancakes filled with sweet (from sugar) red bean paste.)  With a background that seems steeped in Shinto philosophy, the Director has created a very Japanese film.  Kawase also provides a tutorial on proper bean-paste preparation.  There are no plot surprises; everything is well telegraphed in advance (including the mostly happy endings).  Acting is uniformally quite good.  Veteran actress Kirin Kiki () is a knock out in the role of an elderly pastry chef (and noninfectious victim of leprosy).  Actor Masatoshi Nagase delivers a mostly workman like performance.  Actress Kyara Uchida seems a bit too old to play a high school student.  Cinematography (wide screen, color) and lighting are so-so. Scenes shot inside the mini bakery set can go in-and-out of focus.  Other interior and night scenes are usually poorly lit to the point of preventing the viewer from seeing what's happening.  Score is fine, but with a little bit too much piano.  Subtitles are very good due in part to uncomplicated, straight-forward lines of dialog.  Highly recommended.

7751838,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"Moving story coming out of ordinary life without cliche or overt sentimentality.  It really explores in a realistic way the importance and potential of human relationships.

7751840,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"This film is a movie gem that spans at least 3 generations.  I watched it on my streaming service and enjoy the storytelling and character interplay so much that had to order a copy. Someone swiped the package as it was left outside my door; however Amazon, replaced it promptly with polite consideration, not unlike this film. Thank you.",1475366400,6,338,4.728813559322034
7751841,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"Maybe it takes having lived in Nagoya, Japan, and immersed myself in it all to really appreciate ""Sweet Bean,"" but I give this movie 5 stars for capturing the soul of the place and its people with an unexpected sweetness and honesty.  The careful deliberation and attention to every detail in the preparation of a single ""simple"" dish is what characterizes Japanese cooking, and life itself for that matter.  ""Sweet Bean"" is a meditation on attentiveness, perserverance, and humble courage.  For the viewer looking for the glamor of the Geisha, or the flashy pop culture of the Ginza, this movie would be like watching grass grow.  But if you appreciate the Japanese ideal of ""The Unknown Craftsman,"" pour yourself a cup of green tea and enjoy this quiet little masterpiece.",1474416000,18,774,4.930769230769231
7751842,5,B01FT0ZMSU,"This movie did not disappoint. It Left no unfinished business. They were in fact, plenty of cherry blossom trees, which I absolutely adore. The movie was beautiful visually, the story beautiful and timeless. It has a suprising twist, with leprosy  being part of the plot.. So it was educational and eye-opening. I can't imagine anyone would not enjoy this movie. The only issue is its slow pace, yet the beauty keep the pace going in my mind.",1474243200,,442,4.740259740259741

8761494,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"Not everyone appreciates Japanese cinema and how powerful quiet storytelling can be.  It takes some understanding of the culture to appreciate the restraint, the pressures, expectations, everyone's place in life, families, etc.

This is a good film that has a lot of Japanese emotion, telling a story across three generations of Japanese people, and their personal challenges.  Interwoven is the importance and respect for nature.  Highly recommended",1505692800,,450,5.6716417910447765

8761496,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"Sentar runs a Dorayaki restaurant.  It's obviously not something that fills his life with joy, but he has debt obligations to the owners he must fulfill.  When he seeks an employee, Tokue, a woman in her 70s, tries to get the job.  She is obviously thrilled at the idea of working in a restaurant and making her sweet bean paste.  Her hands are crippled, but not so that she can't do the work.  Sentar first says no, but finally hires her after she leaves some of her sweet bean paste with him.  Together they create a booming business and are happy with each other's company.  But soon rumors spread that Tokue's hands are crippled due to Hansen's disease and no one comes to the restaurant.  Up to that point, it's a nicely paced movie.  From then on, however, it starts to move too slowly.  I'm no big fan of action or adventure movies, either, but, even for me, the story just started moving too slowly and became too melodramatic.  That was a shame, too.  It started off so sweetly.",1503100800,,987,4.4525139664804465
8761497,4,B01FT0ZMSU,"The characters are tragic in their circumstances, and just when you think all is going to turn positive, reality sets in to spoil the day.  At the end, there is some breaking away from a life of doom and gloom for the male protagonist, none I could see in regard to the primary high school character, and as for the elderly cook of the delicious sweet bean - well at least she had some sunshine near the end of her life.",1501200000,,420,4.185185185185185
