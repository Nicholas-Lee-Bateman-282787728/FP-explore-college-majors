7958200,5,B0000633S4,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,291,4.407407407407407
7958201,4,B0000633S4,"If you are DBZ fan this is a must buy. You can't never go wrong with having a collection of the best anime of all time in IMO. Get them while you can, you will not be disappointed.",1375833600,,180,3.763157894736842
7958202,4,B0000633S4,"I happen to of had the luck of seeing the entire dragon ball series, and while these three episodes may be lacking in some of the characteristic fighting as seen in most of them (they are running and hidding most of the time), if you are trying to get the entire majin buu saga, then it's worth it.  Alot happens in the these episodes which are very important to the story as a whole.
now that i'm done with the review, i feel i need to vent about a pet peeve.  One thing i can't stand is when arrogant children write reviews on something which they have a natural hatred be it lack of inteligence, or maturity, and then feel the need to share these in a public forum, so please primedmaiden, stop reviewing till you have some real insight",1027555200,2,739,4.271428571428571
7958203,4,B0000633S4,"I was frustrated when Cartoon Network started with reruns all over again right after the episode where Vageta sacrifices himself to kill Buu. Their excuse was that the episodes after weren't made yet, well these dvds prove that they're full of it. Plus if I'm correct there's even another series in Japan called Dragonball G-T that takes after Dragonball Z. So Cartoon Network could easily show all these episodes without just airing 4 months worth a year and delaying the next bunch until September the following year. All I gotta say is thank god  for dvd because I really want to wait to September to see what happens next. A lot happens too I may add, in ""Evil Lives  On"" we learn that Buu isn't dead, in ""Find the Dragonballs"", Bulma and the others search for the dragonballs so they can change the carnage that Vegeta caused and in the last ""Revival"", Goku tells his friends about the fusion of 2 Sayains that could possibly lead to the defeat of Buu. Besides that there's a lot of other new ones on dvd now as well. So don't wait till September when Cartoon Network finally shows more.",1021248000,5,1092,4.566326530612245
7958204,4,B0000633S4,"In these three episodes of The Majin Buu Saga, we learn what has happened after Vegeta's attack supposedly destroyed Buu.  When Piccolo goes to pay his final respect to Vegeta, he watches in horror as Buu regenerates.  It is discovered that Supreme Kai, Goku, and maybe even Gohan are still alive!  Goku has come with a new idea to defeat Majin Buu... Fusion!",1016409600,7,359,4.666666666666667
