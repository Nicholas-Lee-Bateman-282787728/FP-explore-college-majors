8232518,5,B000YF53WG,"REMEMBER WATCHING THIS MOVIE AS A TEEN IN THE 70'S.. BLACK EXPLOITATION MOVIES WAS THE THING THEN.. STILL LOVE THEM TODAY.. LIKE FOXY BROWN,TNT JACKSON AND THE MACK.. BUT !!

8232519,5,B000YF53WG,"Truly odd. A little slow and confusion at times. Low budget and strange. But.... This movie has some hilarious scenes in it. The ridiculousness of this movie is VERY entertaining. There is this classic serenade scene that will have you continuously pressing rewind. It is really classic. The scene where the Dramatics bust out with the hit ""what you see is what you get"" is also classic. Must get...",1314057600,6,399,4.797101449275362
8232520,1,B000YF53WG,"This one is in a class by itself and truely defies description. Somewhere below the Batman TV show in writting and production value, somewhere below Plan Nine from Outer Space in acting. This has got to be one of the wierdest, goofiest, dumbest movies ever made.
Correction, it IS the wierdest, goofiest, dumbest movie ever made.
Every character in the movie is a stereo type with an average IQ of 12. None of the action makes any sense. It's as if they just turned the camera on without a script and told people ""Ok, now act stupid"".
Two things do stand out in the film.
First Roger Mosley, who later went on to become T.C. on the Magnum PI TV series plays a goofy biker. I guess everyone has to start somewhere, though it's amazing this didn't completely kill his career. I wonder how much he'd be willing to pay now to buy up and burn all the existing copies of this cinematic gem?
Second, out of nowhere, the 70s singing group ""The Dramatics"" suddenly appear in the movie. Dressed in full pre disco regalia locked in a makeshift basement jail cell of a white supremist Colonel Sanders wannabe with serious wardrobe issues (he dresses in a nude colored head to toe leotard with a white diaper over it wearing a cape). And then they spontaneously break out in song in their one hit wonder  ""Whatcha see, is whatcha get"" as if someone had suddenly dropped a dime in the jukebox. Where in the world did that come from???? Of course it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. But then the rest of the movie has nothing to do with the rest of the movie either.
Then there's the dumber than dirt ""police squad"" that seems to randomly roam through the movie turning up here and there for absolutely no reason. Imagaine the three stooges plus one tyring to be the keystone cops or buster keaton but without the laughs. What a bunch of morons.

If the Mystery Science Theatre team could ever make a movie themselves for the expressed intent of later going back and skewering it on their show, this is the movie they would make. It's that bad.",1276905600,2,2042,4.442666666666667
8232521,5,B000YF53WG,Caught this film at 2:00 am on late night television.  Couldn't believe that someone was able to get financing to produce it.  So naturally I had to get it on DVD.  It's so bad it's good.  Classic 70s Velveeta.  Definitely in the spirit of Dolemite!  Love it.,1264550400,5,259,4.404255319148936
8232522,5,B000YF53WG,"[...]It is the most amazing, funny, and original piece of work I have ever seen! It's not meant to rival LAWRENCE OF ARABIA by any means -- it is, however, something so brilliantly odd and hysterical that you can't compare it to anything else. I mean, where else will you find an evil Col. Sanders clone? Or a minstrel review over dinner? Look for Dick Miller as one of the policemen. For lovers of oddball cinema, this is your CITIZEN KANE!",1248220800,4,441,4.45679012345679
