6790874,5,B00P8RURKI,A delight!  A well preserved print of this film was recently located and restored.  While a silent movie - it has a complete soundtrack that has a lot of jazz age music.  The movie moves right along and friends that don't usually like silent movies - enjoyed it to the end.,1455408000,,273,4.313725490196078

6790877,3,B00P8RURKI,"I am so glad that this film was released on video. It's an apparent tragedy that more of Moore's work is not available today. It's said that much of her best work is lost or only available in incomplete and undesirable forms. This film is not what I would consider to be a great film, but it's complete and available and showcases the greatness of her performance. The story is mediocre at best and weakened by a forced ending. I won't go into the plot. You can read that in the description. But, if you haven't seen her in action before, this is a glimpse at her  magnificence. I hope that they may find more of her lost films, cause she is a worthy representative of the silent era. A confirmation of the great work that existed in those days and is all too often ignored by the audiences of today. A neat addition to this film is seeing the early work of Neil Hamilton, who was a mild star back then too. He later became Commissioner Gordon in the classic Batman series. Check it out Kids.",1431993600,3,992,4.304812834224599
6790878,4,B00P8RURKI,"Colleen Moore was sort of the poor man's Clara Bow. She lacked Bow's sizzling screen presence but was still pleasant enough to be a star. Most of her films are lost due to a tragic handling mistake at the Museum Of Modern Art's Film division (they were never stored properly and ended up deteriorating. Moore was devastated.). This is an enjoyable, somewhat bland, B silent movie. The title may have been scandalous but the film isn't. Moore plays a good girl who is thought to be a bad girl because she dances the Charleston and likes a bit of night life. She never really does anything bad or questions if she should bother being good, so the title is a big tease. Neil Hamilton (who played the police chief in the Batman TV series 40 years later) is her handsome boyfriend who sometimes wonders if she is good enough to marry. Of course she is, Neil! You won't be on the edge of your seat with this one, but it's a good period piece and has a few moments of some great 20's dancing (not by Moore, though; she just shakes her bangs a lot and does a sort of twist).",1428537600,9,1066,4.308457711442786
6790879,5,B00P8RURKI,"After too many years of Coleen Moore's films of the 1920s not being available, I am thrilled to finally be able to view her in Why Be Good.  Thoroughly enjoyed the jazz-age music, clothes, cars and especially Coleen Moore.  Many years ago, while promoting her book ""Silent Star"" I was fortunate to meet and speak with her at a book store in Buffalo, New York.  I still have her book personally autographed to me.  She was very sweet, and I'll never forget she told me her mother's maiden name was the same as my last name.",1427932800,6,522,4.40625

6790881,5,B00P8RURKI,"This is a fascinating artifact of the transition to sound - the film was shot silent, and a soundtrack of music and sound effects was recorded separately, to be played back on Vitaphone discs in the theater, synchronized with the film.

In addition to the technical interest, the great jazz music played at the skyscraper penthouse party at the beginning of the movie is worth the price of admission alone.",1418601600,13,406,4.8
6790882,5,B00P8RURKI,"My first Colleen Moore film: what a revelation she is. A fun, clever film that entertains effortlessly.",1417996800,6,103,5.117647058823529
6790883,5,B00P8RURKI,"There are far too few Colleen Moore films available on DVD. Colleen Moore was a huge star and a very fine actress. It is sad that such a great star of the silent era is not remembered as well as the Paramount Studio's Jazz era star: Clara Bow. Colleen Moore was as popular as Clara Bow and they both epitomized the flapper. ""Why Be Good?"" is a very enjoyable film and a fine example of why Colleen Moore was a box office success. She plays Pert Kelly who is a good girl who loves to go out dancing and she dances up a storm. This film has the original orchestra and several hit songs from the era are used. Neil Hamilton plays the love interest for Colleen Moore and he does a fine job as a rich young man. The print is fine and so is the film. This was a lost film but was found in eastern Europe. I hope Warner Brothers Archive Collection releases more of Colleen Moore's films. She is quite amazing and this film is an example of why she was so popular. Watch for a glimpse of Jean Harlow on the patio of the penthouse party scene. It is a bonus to buy this film!",1416787200,22,1066,4.080952380952381
8686936,5,B00P8RURKI,"This is SO entertaining!  Great soundtrack, especially put together & recorded at the time the movie was released, the lilting tuns keep things moving right along.  Colleen Moore is at the peak of her (considerable) power in this confection.  We watch a lot of stuff on Netflix, but sadly they don't feature things like this...so thankfully it is readily available here.",1521417600,,370,5.032786885245901
8686937,5,B00P8RURKI,"A somewhat unoriginal story turns into magic by one of the great stars of the silent screen, Colleen Moore. Neil Hamilton, who is now remembered as the commission in the 1960s TV show ""Batman"" TV, has full matinee idol looks and is Moore's dashing beau. This film, Moore's last silent film, was considered ""lost"" for many years. A print of it was only recently found in Italy. It has been lovingly restored and looks terrific.",1507593600,,426,4.693333333333333
8686938,5,B00P8RURKI,"Wealthy Winthrop meets a girl at a club. She was the life of the party and the center of everyones attention. Shes hot, shes beautiful, shes flirty, shes a dance contest winnerthe ultimate flapper. He was instantly infatuated. The next morning Winthrop starts work as the Personnel Director at his fathers department store where there are rules against dating the employees. (The store has over 1000 female employees.) One of his first acts as Personnel Director is to discipline a tardy sales girlsurprisingly, the girl hed met the night before. Her father thinks shes a strumpet for accepting expensive gifts from a rich boyfriend. His father thinks shes a tramp because shes a working girl. The plot centers on whether or not shes a good girl.
This silent film is fascinating. Plenty of beautiful flappers throwing around a lot of Jazz Age slang and partying hard. Its a close look at dating, partying, and the social mores of the time. Its a great peek into the Roaring Twenties. The soundtrack is jazzy and amusing. Colleen Moore as Pert is beautiful and utterly irresistible. This film is highly entertaining and must see viewing.",1506816000,,1136,4.921875
8686939,5,B00P8RURKI,"A beautiful presentation of a rare, recently re-discovered film from the Vitaphone era, WHY BE GOOD (1929) is a story of a young girl who is trying to protect her reputation of being 'bad' while still maintaining her virginity. Needless to say, hilarity ensues. In addition to a vintage photoplay score, performances from some of the era's hottest jazz bands (including Jimmy Dorsey) are contained in the film.  It's a jazz-baby romp of the first order and definitely worth adding to your collection!",1505952000,,500,5.024096385542169
8686940,1,B00P8RURKI,"Movie is OK, but disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, so it costs more and may have quality issues.",1486684800,,98,3.7142857142857144
8686941,5,B00P8RURKI,This is one off  the best moves I have ever seen.  Colleen Moore is one of the best silent stars .  She was a special lady. Most of her work has been lost . She was a supper star in the 20's.,1484179200,,191,3.5

8686943,3,B00P8RURKI,Only watch this if you are a Colleen Moore fan or you want to see a young Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) from the 60's Batman series.  I found it kind of boring and predictable.  The print is not bad though.,1476230400,,212,4.275
