This is based on the book by Caryl Chessman, his autobiography of the most infamous juvenile delinquent in the 1950s. It starts on Death Row where prisoners awaiting execution are held. Chessman made his will during his six-year stay, and wrote popular books. What made him that way? Who knows? [Some say poverty, poor parentage, and bad companions do this.] Why am I here? The zoo has dangerous animals that must be locked up. A car accident crippled his Mom and impoverished his family. [Obsolete coal gas had carbon monoxide, unlike the natural gas used today.] Whit steals a car to meet a girl, who asks him to drive fast on a rural dirt road. Two young men meet them. Is Whit a good wheelman? Whit joins a gang of small thieves. But one of them is caught and squeals!

Whit is sent to Reform School [Prep School for criminals?]. Whit is rebellious and is put in solitary with added tear gas. He learns a lot before his parole. [Note his attitude.] No drinking, no firearms, stay off the street, etc. He rejoins a gang, they rob people. [No masks to hide their faces.] Whit finds a doll. He continues his crimes. One night he steals a police car! One of his gang shoots a policeman on a motorcycle. Other police cars shoot at their car, setting the gas tank on fire! This time its San Quentin. Warden Duffy tells of a working farm at Chino for those who qualify. Whit will act very good to be sent there. Men in watchtowers look for airplanes (its WW II). Whit escapes to a waiting car. Another convict brags about his thefts. Will he be caught? Next its Folson, the maximum security prison. After four years Whit is paroled. Its back to his criminal life.

Whit continues his resentment of authority, he refuses to go straight. The gang plans to hijack the hijackers. They cant go to the police. First they rob the messengers who carry cash for the Syndicate. They knock over a dice game. Then its a house with girls and gambling. Next an Investment Broker who keeps large amounts of cash for emergencies (like a kidnapping). Are they too hot for Los Angeles? They will split up. The Red Light Bandit strikes again! He attacks couples parked in cars. The men are beaten, the women molested. Whit drops by to see a girlfriend. She doesnt want him there. We see why.

The police set up a decoy team. One patrol car sees a car that matches the description, they chase it and catch the driver. The victims identify Whit as the Red Light Bandit. Whit tries to explain his actions. [Does he talk too much?] His lawyer refuses to represent him and explains why. No one believed him. The judge explains what can happen to him if he acts as his own lawyer. Whit was charged with 18 felonies, conviction would lead to a death penalty. A sadistic fiend? Who will the jury believe? Whit shows his skills in his objections. Motion denied. There is another stay of execution. Then another. What will happen next? [Whits appeals were finally exhausted.]

While he denied it, it seems the crimes of the Red Light Bandit ended with Whits capture. Whit spent the rest of his life in prison. Could the Syndicate have used their influence against Whit? Was this movie meant to explain Whits bad life? It could serve as a moral lesson. Those who attack society will suffer punishment as self-defense. Should Whit have received the death penalty? That law was later abolished, although not everyone knew about it (The Onion Field).

William Campbell played the part of Chessman; usually he was a character actor. His first wife Judith divorced him and married another man. Judith Campbell Exner became famous as the girlfriend of President John F. Kennedy and a Chicago gangster. She was used as a conduit to pass a satchel of money to the latter.",1477353600,,3763,4.583952451708766
