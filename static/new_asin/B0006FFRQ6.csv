2182549,4,B0006FFRQ6,i saw this movie in the theaters before. and i must say that this was one of the best comedies ive seen in years.,1112832000,,113,3.75
2182550,4,B0006FFRQ6,The Cookout was a pretty fun movie too watch. Where this movie has alot of hilarious scenes. And this is a must see movie for all fans of comedies.,1112832000,,147,4.103448275862069
2182551,1,B0006FFRQ6,"i typically don't write bad reviews, but this was just aweful. i didn't crack a smile the entire time i watched it. instead i just got more pissed off by the moment. i don't blame any of the actors/actresses for this because it wasn't their fault, except for maybe danny glover for accepting such a rediculous role as a white bred black guy who is scared of other black people moving into the neighborhood, but then dramatically changes into the thing he hates after smoking some weed. it was a shame that this one even got off the editting room floor. BUT if you like movies where stereotypes are running wild, this one is for you.",1109548800,4,632,4.456896551724138
2182552,1,B0006FFRQ6,"Oh yes, this movie is just a waist of time. the cookout made me love fast food even more. do you're self a favor don't wach this movie...",1107993600,2,137,3.9285714285714284
2182553,2,B0006FFRQ6,"I can't even believe that folks actually thought this was a funny movie.  It had a few moments, and I mean a few, but it just wasn't enough to justify paying 19 bucks for this.  The concept was a good one cuz anybody in the african american community knows what it's like when we have ""our"" family cookouts anuually.  However, along with a great idea came miscasting.  For one, how does Ja Rule, Eve, or even Quran Pender (who I've never heard of) get casted for a movie like this when it's clear they cannot act.  Meagan Good went from the cute sassy girl on Eve's Bayou to now playing hoochies on a regular?  Secondly, how do you cast Queen Latifah, Danny Glover of all people, Farah Fawcett, Tim Meadows, and the beautiful Jennifer Lewis and Frankie Faison, all veteran actors and actresses who's been in the game a long long time and instead of creating a script and letting them enhance the script, Lance Rivera makes them look bufoonish.  Well, there you have it, Lance ""um"" Rivera.  Lance stick to making videos and leave the big screen to real directors.  They should have never entrusted a cast that i just mentined to an amatuer like Rivera.  A wasted script with quality actors and actresses.  Yes, it's a matter of opinion and this opinion states that this movie stinks.",1107129600,11,1282,4.554585152838428
2182554,1,B0006FFRQ6,Another talented cast wasted on awful writing. Queen Latifah's appearance made this movie bearable to watch.,1106438400,,108,5.8125
2182555,4,B0006FFRQ6,"Think of this picture as an urban ""Christmas Vacation.""  The whole family comes over to Todd's new mansion, have a cookout, and chaos ensues.  Todd is a recently recruited NBA player, Jennifer Lewis plays his common sense mother, who believes in family, Eve plays Todd's childhood friend, but it is Queen Latifah who steals the show as a full throttle security guard.  EVERY scene she's in is funny, and it shows what a shiny talent she is.  Tim Meadows, Farrah Fawcett, and Danny Glover round out this impressive cast.  Some of the humor is VERY stereotypical, but still pretty funny.  A funny movie with a heartfelt message about family, self pride, and values.",1106265600,2,663,4.823008849557522
2182556,3,B0006FFRQ6,Great Movie,1408665600,,11,5.0
2182557,1,B0006FFRQ6,"The talent associated with this should be embarrassed that they ever agreed to be part of it.. I can't tell what's worse: The bad script, the no sense of timing direction, the horrible story or the bad acting. It's all so horrible. Not one laugh to be found in this sad stereotypical mess. It's right up there in the same league with Soul Plane..",1403913600,,346,4.421875
2182558,5,B0006FFRQ6,"This is a parody of someone who is a high school and college star that is about to hit it big in the NBA!  He buys a house in a gated community and the fun starts there!  Queen Latifah, the late Farrah Fawcett and Danny Glover round out the cast.  You will be laughing from the beginning until the end.  I have watched it more than twice and continue to laugh.  I saw this on cable and decided to buy it because it is so funny and outlandish!",1402790400,,442,3.977272727272727
2182559,5,B0006FFRQ6,I love the movie the cookout and had to get it for my kindle fire. It looks amazing on the kindle fire. I encourage all who love a good movie to get The Cookout.,1337126400,,161,3.764705882352941
2182560,5,B0006FFRQ6,great movie funny as hell will watch to over and over again suggest you buy it for your family now,1325462400,,98,3.95
2182561,5,B0006FFRQ6,The DVD arrived in vey little time and shows beautifully.  Thank you for the excellent service.,1270252800,,95,4.9375
2182562,3,B0006FFRQ6,"Don't go into watching this movie with any expectations other than that of laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all.  While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's really only good for Saturday-at-home-with-a-snack type of viewing.",1268438400,,253,4.883720930232558
2182563,3,B0006FFRQ6,"When Todd Anderson signs a $30 million deal with his hometown team, the New Jersey Nets, he knows that his life is set for a big change. To keep things real, he decides to throw a barbeque at his place just like the ones his family used to have. But when you have new and old friends, family, agents, and product reps in the same house, things are bound to get crazy. This movie had a good message about being responsible and down to earth even after hitting pay dirt. The Cookout is a ok movie, if you take if for what it is.",1263859200,2,526,4.0673076923076925
2182564,4,B0006FFRQ6,I am glad that I was finally able to see this movie. The DVD worked well.,1256688000,,73,3.625
2182565,1,B0006FFRQ6,"DO NOT put this as one of the top Black movies. It evokes NO emotion with HORRIBLE acting. It promotes stereotypical roles of Blacks, and it is not even entertaining.",1256256000,,166,4.566666666666666
2182566,2,B0006FFRQ6,"this movie was far from funny...the jokes were corny and predictable, many scenes were stereotypical and played out. The was a good storyline and the writer could've done much better with it than resort to the corny jokes and stereotypes. Stay away from this movie at all costs...don't pay for it or rent it...catch it on cable like I did. Now I know why this tanked at the movies...",1154390400,2,383,4.565217391304348
2182567,1,B0006FFRQ6,"This movie was so bad that I got up and left the theatre before it was over. To call this movie boring would be an insult to boring movies. So many talented actors, so little entertainment. Please don't waste your time on this one. You'll probably come out better watching paint dry. Believe me, that would be far more entertaining.",1153008000,4,332,4.55
2182568,1,B0006FFRQ6,"This movie was full of stereotypical characters that you really don't care about. I don't think there is one original idea in this film.

Just a few stereotypes that stood out were:

- The young black guy getting drafted, as if that is all that young black guys aspire to.

- The young attractive goldigger girlfriend

- The overprotective mother and goofy father

- Once blacks move into the neighborhood all of their family come, which are always ghetto, and take over the neighborhood

- The ""cool"" white guy that is down with everyone.

Geez!

Now moving on to the predictability:

- From the getgo, did we not know that he would get picked?

- It was so obvious way before Eve came in the picture that the goldigger girlfriend would get dropped and that Eve would get the guy.

There was no real substance to the film, so other than those 2 points, nothing else was really going on. Farah Fawcett??? Why???

I really don't think that I laughed once the entire film. The characters that Queen Latifah and Danny Glover played were just plain embarassing. So over the top and NOT funny. I really don't like this film and probably will never watch it again.

I really like the lady that plays the mom (can't remember her name), Queen Latifah and Danny Glover, but I cannot recommend this film. Don't waste your time.",1141084800,6,1317,4.553191489361702
2182569,1,B0006FFRQ6,"This movie was not funny at all. I was very dissapointed. No wonder it dissapeared from the theaters as quickly as it appeared. Great talents like Jennifer Lewis, Danny Glover, Farrah Fawcett and the incomparable Queen Latifah wasted their respectable and impecable talents on this boring flick. Jennifer, Danny, Farrah and Latifah, I forgive you!",1140393600,4,347,5.327272727272727
2182570,1,B0006FFRQ6,"THE COOKOUT WAS ONE OF THE WEAKEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN.PERIOD.AND DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE,IT PROBABLY STINKS AT HOME JUST LIKE AT THE MOVIES.",1123200000,,141,4.916666666666667
2182571,3,B0006FFRQ6,"A somewhat all-star cast, put them all together and have a cookout!! What happens when a relative of yours goes all out in basketball and gets number one draft pick by one of the best basketball teams of all times???  $$$ and lots of it!! That is what happens to the main character in this film (Anderson).  Although he is drafted by one of the top teams, and gets in excess of a 30 million dollar contract, freinds and family will not let him forget where he came from.  Meet the gold-digging girlfriend....she gets him to think big...real BIG, and just sit back and watch the craziness as everyone tries to keep Anderson's feet on the ground...or up in the air!!!

Not the greatest film, but it is somewhat cute...you may chuckle a few times, but this is not one that you may want to watch over and over again....",1114992000,,815,4.413333333333333
2182572,3,B0006FFRQ6,"Originally I said I wouldn't buy this movie.  BECAUSE we all know too well that too many African American's in one low budget film is pure and simple HELL!

Now although I didn't HATE this movie, it's far from great.  YET it has quality meanings.

1st round pick in the NBA Todd Anderson tries to maintain his ""ghetto badge"" while popping a new Range, a Jacob, and of all things bricks in a ritzy gated suburb.

As Todd's mom, Lady M,(Jennifer Lewis)tries to warn him about ""his"" money.  She soon discovers that it's somewhat too late.  With a gold digger on the loose she has to pull out the swiftness to keep up with Brittany (Meagan Good) who's eyes sparkle like DIAMONDS!

Todd has spent more than he can chew.  So now he needs to sell himself out for endorsements in order to stay afloat.  Can he get what he needs with family all up in there?

Ya'll know my saying support ya people!

I did laugh some.  I liked the cast even though it was ""sterotypical""",1113091200,,960,4.3559322033898304
