5184308,3,B008V864W6,"While a group of quality videos, this is far from a complete collection. One should notice that of the 26 videos, 14 are performances of only 4 songs and of the 26, 14 in Japanese comprising an entire disc. The entire third disc is just an interview with the group watching the videos.  This was basically a package put out for the Japanese market.  This is best suited for only the most dedicated fans even at the discounted price!

5184309,5,B008V864W6,"The 3 disc Blu-ray version is great It comes with a photo book, pen that lights up with a SNSD member, a cell phone charm. It's super great if you love Girls' Generation. Definitely worth the money.",1380585600,5,198,4.378378378378378

5184311,5,B008V864W6,Good collection; there were some new and older videos I had not seen.  Worth the money if you're a GG fan.,1374105600,,106,4.0476190476190474

5184313,5,B008V864W6,i enjoy k-pop and girls are one of the top 5 groups you cant go wrong with this dvd they are very talentinted and beautiful.  so if you buy it cant go wrong,1370044800,2,156,3.727272727272727
5184314,5,B008V864W6,Whole family loves it.  9 beautiful women who are truly gifted musically and talented without having to be overtly sexual or wear the skimpiest of costumes.,1364688000,12,156,5.0
8530791,5,B008V864W6,This is an excellent dvd set. If you are a SONE or just a fan of GIRLS' GENERATION you should love this. The picture quality is fantastic and no matter who is your bias in SNSD you can get the best views. Some of the videos I have never seen completely before since they are Japanese versions and youtube doesn't have full length of them. If you love the 9 ladies this is for you. On these discs you can find many of the best songs from Korea and Japan. First time viewers of KPOP might find this interesting and a good introduction to this genre. You will find the songs are clean fun and the girls pretty and sweet. Don't be afraid to try new things. Also thanks to SecondSpin for quickly sending me my order. Though my copy is used you would never know because it was immaculate.,1476316800,,782,4.22
8530792,5,B008V864W6,Im really disappointed i didn't discover this group until now. They are simply amazing. They're as talented as they are beautiful. Each girl is special. Their songs are so catchy and you can listen to them and watch their videos over and over and never tire of them. Their smiles alone probably double their sales. Their feel good attitude shows up in the performances of their concerts and videos. This is precisely what's wrong  with the majority of artists in America where it seems having a badass attitude rules. These girls exude sexiness in a way that someone like a Myley Cyrus doesn't understand. Their songs are also a perfect example where much less is more. You don't need to sing a million notes like Maria Carey and Christina Aguilera.,1465257600,2,749,4.7615384615384615

8530795,5,B008V864W6,"I love this set, because not only it's the cheapest that I've ever gotten, but as a Blu-ray set (which is a steal of a deal)!! I'm glad they have something like this, compared to other kpop sites that sell this merchandise for an even more expensive price.... The only lame part is that the discs don't have English subs, but oh well, if you don't care about what they're saying with English subs, it's all good for a decent price.",1429660800,,431,4.333333333333333
8530796,5,B008V864W6,I bought this for my sister so she could have a tangible item from her favorite group. It came brand new and on time. The box it comes in itself done by the original distributor is a bit difficult to open so it might take a while. Overall excellent service and amazing package.,1428796800,,277,4.245283018867925

8530798,5,B008V864W6,"Beyond a doubt, the K-pop phenomena has taken the world by storm within a relatively short period of time, and unlike Hong Kong music which only has appeal among Asians, K-pop, much like Bollywood movies, have ridden a wave of international popularity the world over, with scant wonder why as can easily be seen in this Girls Generation: Complete Video Collection, for the popularity of Korean girl groups can easily be attributed to their fancy for hot pants that amply reveal their creamy and shapely white thighs and constitute sexual titillation for the audience, given the fact that the dance moves of these girl groups involve gyration of the hips that tantalizes. Furthermore, in almost every K-pop girl group, with possibly the exception of Girls Generation, you will usually discover two Korean girls whose appearance are so extraordinarily beautiful they are to die for and will have you keeling over, in particular the girls from 4 Minutes, After School and Secret. This may just transform k-pop from a fad into a lasting fashion for generations to come.

Girls Generation is probably one of the most popular K-pop girl groups aside from Wonder Girls, with understandable reason why, for their tunes incorporate catchy pop melodies that employ a great hook from the chorus onwards to keep the audience hooked.

The Video collection begins with an hour long interview with the girls, which for some inconceivable reason, does not enable the audience to engage English subtitles - leaving one to wonder what the hell is transpiring.

Disc 2 comprises of the Japanese versions the Girls Generation songs with two version of four songs being offered back to back, the original version and the more upbeat version that will have you knee-tapping and rocking with the beat, with the two best songs probably being Run Devil Run and Time Machine. The last three songs on the disc comprise of re-edited versions of songs from the 1st. Japan tour, with rightful recognition being placed on Mr. Taxi - which features great costumes and sexually titillating dance moves, featuring the lovely and fabulous legs of these girls as well as great dance choreography.

Disc 3 comprises of the Korean version of Girls Generation hits with most of the songs losing out to the Japanese version, which incorporate slightly more catchy melodies. However, recognition has to be given to The Boys which is probably the best songs in the entire anthology, and like all K-pop groups, their most popular songs are also rendered in English for the benefit of English-speaking audiences. Having said that, the English version of The Boys begins and ends with the most stylistic-rendered MTV of their entire collection - depicting a bird flying in slow-motion with a shower of petals of flowers raining down at one third speed, thereby, creating an impressionistic atmosphere.

On the overall, a great K-pop girls group collection to have with most of the songs being satisfying from a musical standpoint.

Highly recommended.",1399507200,8,3006,5.062626262626263
8530799,5,B008V864W6,I purchased this DVD at the Temple Street Night Market in Hong Kong in October of 2013. I asked a salesman at one of the music shops for an Asian-Pop DVD recommendation; he and his co-worker were adamant that I should purchase this DVD. And now I can't stop watching it!,1388102400,,270,4.313725490196078
8530800,5,B008V864W6,"Awesome video quality and great bonuses. Although it's now technically 'incomplete' as they keep releasing videos this collection is really good'
At the recent special pricing I've seen this at, you shouldn't pass it up!!
My only complaint is that the tin is rather hard to open but the contents are still awesome.",1381968000,5,314,4.943396226415095
