The music is simple and folksy, the jokes come smoothly, and the actors feel like everyday people.  The writing is very natural and the jokes are plentiful but not forced.  DGP is very modern and very down to earth.  I would recommend this to just about anyone, however....

...it is a Scottish show.  Meaning, viewers will either need to turn on the subtitles (which help quite a bit) or brush up on their Scottish accent and slang.  I have become a big fan of Scottish shows and have put in the effort to learn all the lingo.  Not everyone wants to put in that time, but I think it's well worth it.  These days I watch little other than shows from the UK, and the Scottish shows are by far the funniest things I've seen.

Also, it means this DVD is ""Region 2"" so you'll need a DVD player that can play it.  (American DVDs are ""Region 1"")  I bought a Region 2 DVD player here on Amazon for less than $35.  Well worth it if you find you like BBC original shows.

Some background....  Dear Green Place is the third tv series (I think) involving members of the ""Still Game"" group.  It's produced by the same ""Eff n' Gee"" Company (Greg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan) that made Still Game, although Hemphill is not in this.  I love Still Game, so I've been watching all the other series featuring those actors.  Fans should also check out ""Chewin' the Fat"" which was their first series.

What is Dear Green Place?  The title is a Scottish phrase referring to parks and such locations.  This sitcom is centered around a large park and its caretaker crew (called ""parkies"").  Ford Kiernan plays the a-bit-too-serious-for-his-job supervisor and Paul Riley (who played Winston on Still Game) is a senior member of the crew.  Unlike Still Game which has a classic sitcom feel, DGP is very modern.  DGP is very low key, natural in its delivery.  I often refer to it as a ""sit-dram"" since it's as much a ""situational drama"" as a ""situational comedy.""  I point this out because it is notably different in style from Chewin' The Fat or Still Game.

So far I've watched every episode of Season One twice (with and without subtitles).  By mid-season I was totally engaged in these characters and can't wait to watch Season Two--which is hard to find on DVD.  I think they're on YouTube, but I'd rather buy the DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-Green-Place-Series-1/dp/B000VVT1O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear Green Place - Series 1</a>",1468972800,2,2585,4.785067873303167
