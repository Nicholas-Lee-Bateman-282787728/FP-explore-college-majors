8491476,4,B0062UBOY8,It is a great movie but the menu on the dvd is messed up. It blanks out with a visible rectangle button. I pressed it and the audio choice screen came up. I pressed one Then u finally found the subtitles choice. The subtitles are very small during the movie so u can't sit far from the screen if u want to read them. I was told by other sellers (even one From India)...very much appreciated before I purchased another. .. that this dvd does have defects so don't think it's just yours and buy another one as the same thing Will happen again.,1454803200,,541,4.211538461538462
