2190365,2,B0006OEXTE,"I bought this movie because I read all of the postitve reviews. I love Mafia movies and I own a lot of them. This is the ONLY mafia movie that I have watched and did NOT like.  I was very uninteresting, very boring, and I will never watch it again.",1292803200,2,248,3.96
2190366,5,B0006OEXTE,"Am interested in early history regarding formation of ""The Five Families"".This movie is fairly accurate as opposed to similar films on subject. Highly watchable and entertaining.",1246060800,,178,5.884615384615385
2190367,4,B0006OEXTE,"this is actually 2 movies on this dvd. it is based of the same book as the other  movie about bonnano. but the vhs movie that i have has parts of both movies on this dvd and a better ending, however i cannot find that movie on dvd. but a great movie with a lot of backstory.if you like books on the mafia and the bonnano family this has a lot of information. get it",1237248000,,365,3.8666666666666667
2190368,3,B0006OEXTE,"The film was entertaining enough and relatively accurate. Somehow the books and movies the Bonannos involved themselves with cast them as superior, a cut above their mafia contemporaries.  I find this difficult to believe, as a History instructor teaching about the Mafia.  I showed some of the film in class and for what its worth, most of my students seemed to enjoy it.  The sequence of events known as the Castellammarese War were addressed in vivid detail.",1233792000,,461,4.961038961038961
2190369,5,B0006OEXTE,"I bought this dvd as a gift and the recipient was very pleased. I am actually thinking about purchasing another copy for myself. If you are into mafia/gangster movies such as Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, and The Godfather series minus the well known actors, you will enjoy this one. Especially because it is based on true events! Great movie, great buy!",1231718400,,350,4.754098360655738
2190370,5,B0006OEXTE,"I enjoyed the family history of Joseph Bonnano, beginning first with his father and eventually leading up to young Joe. There are some nuggets in here that constitute the mentality and behavior of the future family boss. In America, the story helps us to see how a young Italian immigrant almost  is forced into this type of a life. There are quite a bit of scenes that seem to be authentic and there is some history as to the developing of the  Mafia families. I have always enjoyed not only the wars but also some good mafia ""sit downs.""

2190371,5,B0006OEXTE,"I thought the acting was excellent.  I saw this first on Showtime a few years back and was very impressed with it.  It showed Joe Bonnano the way that I truly belive he was.  He was they only mob leader to use violence as a last resort.  In no way do I condone using any type of criminal activity, (especially since I'm a retired cop, and Italian), but as far as entertainment goes, this is one of the better movies.",1178668800,29,416,4.1625

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

Immingrant flees Sicily to seek a better life in America.  He tries to be an honest citizen but is lured into the world of the Mafia.  He becomes the right-hand to a powerful don, and, subsequently becomes the MAN himself.  AT 26, he begins a long, career as a ""respected"" Mafia chieftan, occasionally running afoul of the law that frequently happens to be in his back pocket.

That's the movie in a nutshell, or perhaps, a TOMMY GUN.",1109462400,13,646,4.8807339449541285

2190378,4,B0006OEXTE,"My only problem with this TV miniseries is that it makes the gangster Joe Bonanno look like a hero.  Well, he may have been fairly clean compared to most of the other Mafia chiefs, but he was still a gangster.
It is still an enjoyable series, and it contains some interesting perspective on the role Lucky Luciano played in helping the Allies invade Sicily.",1358640000,,357,4.578125
2190379,3,B0006OEXTE,This is a good movie and has a good story... But it looks like mr bonanno was trying to make him selvf look like a mr nice guy and that the other mob familys are only thinking of money and power. But again... A good movie:),1355961600,,223,3.869565217391304
2190380,1,B0006OEXTE,"Be forewarned-this is NOT the complete 4 part movie produced by showtime. This is only the first 2 episodes. If you want the complete story, look for ""Bonanno: A Godfathers Story, The Complete Series"" which is currently around 65 bucks, otherwise you're just getting half the movie. It strikes me that one of the producers is listed as 'Bill Bonnano'. So is this just a way to rip off the public and get them to buy the same movie twice in order to rake in more royalties? Think about it...who sells half a movie? Gee, I hope I don't get whacked for exposing this fraud!!",1321142400,9,571,4.447619047619048

2190382,3,B0006OEXTE,"This is a movie based on the book A Man of Honor by Joseph Bonanno the once legendary mob boss of the Bonanno family. This movie is the childhood telling from Bonnano and the highlight of the book the Casellammarese war which was the war that caused the Mafia to form itself as it is now. Interesting but dry you keep asking the same question what are you hiding what aren't you telling in order not to incriminate yourself or your family.
So the story is acceptable but not finished. I guess if you love Mafia movies this is worth investing in.",1311292800,,545,4.352941176470588
