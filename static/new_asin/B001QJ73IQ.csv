3765221,4,B001QJ73IQ,"overall I enjoyed the DVD. My swing had all sorts of kinks in it that I was trying to work out. I am novice when it comes to golf, however I am competitive and just want to become halfway decent when it comes to this frustrating game. I thought the DVD certainly helped my game, it had good tips and drills you could practice on your own. The only downfall is David Leadbetter is very dry and boring in this video.",1313020800,5,414,4.1234567901234565
