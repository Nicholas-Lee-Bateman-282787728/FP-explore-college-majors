7902669,4,B000003K9O,"The hook on ""Heroes & Demons,"" Episode 12 of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" (Written by Naren Shankar, Aired April 24, 1995) is that the Doctor (Robert Picardo) goes on his first Away Mission.  The trick is that he does this without ever leaving ""Voyager.""  It seems Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) is (wasting limited energy resources) playing the hero in the ""Beowulf"" program in the ship's holodeck when he disappears.  Chakotay (Robert Beltran) and Tuvok (Tim Russ) enter the Holodeck and find the ""Beowful"" program still running, but no sign of Kim.  When they join in the fight against Grendel they disappear as well.  Tired of losing crewmembers, Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) sends the EMH off to do battle on the holodeck.  The Doctor is apprehensive but willing to do honor to the new name he has adopted: Schwitzer.  However once there he discovers he not only has to deal with Vikings and a monster, but the affections of the lovely Freya (Marjorie Monaghan).
For those of you who enjoy watching the propsect of the Doctor engaging in good old fashioned swordplay, this is the episode you want to watch.  There are also some tentative movements for the Doctor in terms of honest emotions as clearly the producers are trying to set up the character for future developments.  Since ""Heroes & Demons"" begins with ""Voyager"" taking samples of photonic energy from a protostar (and there is a breach in the transporter's containment field) you know that somehow this has something to do with what is happening on the holodeck.  But ""Heroes & Demons"" is not so much a mystery episode as it is character development in the Doctor's journey to becoming ""real,"" so the scientific explanation takes a back seat to the Doctor fighting the good fight and learning some valuable lessons from his first Away Mission.",1055289600,,1797,4.862295081967213

It will be his first away mission: a special occacion, and not without hazard, since the safety limits are offline. The episode takes place in the time of Beowulf, with Vikings, desperate Kings,. monsters and fighting maidens. The Doctor has ample opportunity to show his poetic, romantic and valiant sides. Some scenes are very funny. Especially those where the Doctor,with his dry comments, intellect en photons interacts with the medieval supersticious Vikings. This is surely one of the better episodes for the Doctor.",975110400,3,638,5.085714285714285
