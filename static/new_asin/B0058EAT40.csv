I think that is standard fare with National Geographic which is surprising considering that it is an educational channel. Also, i think I read that it is a DVD-R which is why it has no menu whatsoever, not even a chapter search.",1483056000,,380,4.277777777777778

8461489,5,B0058EAT40,"A very informative DVD - covered the 1962 break out in fantastic detail. It had unseen documents and clues.
A very worthwhile, enlightening documentary.",1367539200,2,152,5.375

Very disappointed!!!",1356480000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8461491,5,B0058EAT40,"Just finished watching the documentary.  Excellent update on the infamous break out from Alcatraz Island that occurred nearly fifty years ago.  Newly released documents (unseen for years) show that a raft was found on Angel Island as well as footprints leading away from it.  The investigation is investigated and led by the U.S. Marshals' Service with involvement from the FBI.  Very interesting details suggest there was more to this story than was known at the time the movie, Escape from Alcatraz with Eastwood was made.  Short, 45 minute film that anyone interested in the topic or who has seen the movie should definitely check out.",1330300800,6,638,5.038095238095238
8461492,5,B0058EAT40,"For years, my wife and I debated whether Morris and the Anglins made it out alive.  We suggested looking into any car or boat thefts in the area just after the escape that might indicate where they'd come ashore.  Apparently the official word was that the raft was never found and there were no relevant crimes.  Now, it seems new information has been released to the FBI, indicating that the convict raft was indeed found and a car stolen, etc.  I invite you to examine these and other new items of evidence and decide for yourself what really happened.
I watched this on TV and had to get the DVD so we could watch it again together.  Highly recommended to fans of the legend or the Clint Eastwood film, Escape from Alcatraz.",1316563200,7,727,4.4772727272727275
