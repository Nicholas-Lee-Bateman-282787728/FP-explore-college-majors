I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed it considering all the bad reviews I had read. The graphics are in the same ballfield as what you've seen in Lawnmower man, the story line however is much better than that in my opinion.

The story goes something like this, there is a tyrant who owns the internet and is in the top tier of the web. Him and his selected few moderators can change things and charge people what they'd like to purely use the web and transfer money etc.. The web looks drastically different than the real life one we know and love. It's more like having an avatar in a computer game that you can input your memories and teachings into, that way it can complete online jobs for you without you even logging on. Almost like a macro program but much cooler looking, did I mention to log onto this ""web"" you have to wear snazzy VR head gear? ;)

Without giving away too much of the story, there are some double crossings and murders abound which eventually lead our main character into having a very minute amount of power with his avatar on the web.

As I had said above the graphics are decent for old school 1990's sci fi but most people would scoff at them now. The movie is actually a Danish film with so-so dubbing. I tried to see if there was Danish audio with subtitles, but alas there is not.

The sound and picture quality are good considering it's a low budget film. The music has it's own soundtrack and through out the film there are some pretty good techno/trance beats if you are into that sort of thing.

This movie is cheap enough that if you are a Cyberpunk fan there are some cool and different ideas here, and for a 1998 film it's a fun ride. I wouldn't recommend it on the whole to movie watchers or sci fi buffs.

Overall I would give this movie a C+ grade wise, for being an old school Cyberpunk romp. It can be cheesey, but some times cheese can be darn fun =).",1314230400,2,2032,4.278645833333333
7895462,1,6305799679,"Poor acting, an awful dubbing job, dull direction, a lame predictable plot, a really terrible script that contains long out of place bondage sex scenes that weren't erotic, meaningful, or anything but an excuse to have bondage sex scenes in this film.

This is all combined in a film that takes itself way too seriously, even though its cutting edge ""cyberworld"" looks like a computer graphics program from the early 90s.",1095811200,,421,4.929577464788732
7895463,3,6305799679,"One of the my favorite movie sort is a CyberFunk movie.
Actually, I saw the movie at first time in Cyber Movie Event in Korea.
At that time, the 'Webmaster' movie has lots of stuff about future cyber world.
For example, 'Terabye Security System' and 'Cyber Ego', etc.
In my opinion, this is not funny and exciting movie any other famous action or
cyber sorts of movie. But,If you really addicted to computer related things,
it can be really interesting and exciting movie for you, although the movie is not popular in many people.
But, Actually I gave 3 stars for the movie because, the dvd title is dubbed as English Audio. ( This title is Danish film. )
It means the point of audio part is really unnatural.
Anyway, Please don't expect the movie story with any other movie's story. This is Just Cyber Underground world.
Just see what is the cyberworld, If you do that, It'll be so interesting or exciting movie of you. :)",1004054400,3,923,4.532934131736527
7895464,4,6305799679,"I don't know how many times I saw this in the video store, snickered at it with my computer-savy friends because of the ridiculous title, and passed  it by.  A few days ago however, I was in the mood for some cheesy Sci-Fi  and thought, ""Why not?""  Boy was I shocked.
  The synopsis on  the back of the video is as bad as the title, but for a foreign film,  dubbed into english, this can be excused.  I don't know what to say except  I really, really enjoyed this film!  The plot was simple but gripping, the  costuming was excellent, and the technology very believable.  You won't see  Joe Shmo flying through cyberspace ""hacking a Gibsin"" on his  Apple Computer with a 28.8k modem here.  Only the military (and our  fearless hero) are allowed Terrabit connections to the internet, and even  then, the tastefully few glimpses we get of ""cyberspace"" barely  look different than ordinary VRML technology of today.  Techno-music,  bounty hunters, an underground SNM club, evil psychotic gang leaders, a  little gore here and there, and a very hard-core cyberpunk feel make this  movie a sure cult classic.
I didn't give the movie a 5 because only the  greatest movies deserve those.  This movie gets a 4 because it's fun,  intelligent, and the kind of movie I could watch over and over.",965779200,15,1284,4.645739910313901
