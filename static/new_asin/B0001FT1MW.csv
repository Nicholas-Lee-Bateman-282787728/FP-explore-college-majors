8193583,1,B0001FT1MW,"This dvd is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to pay for.
The picture quality looks like the lowest grade pirate rip-off you have ever seen x100. The sound only comes out of one speaker !! I own some very obscure films from cheap-jack dvd companies, who could care less about the quality of what they put out, but this dvd is so far beyond atrocious that i am unable to watch what i have paid for. By the way this is a classic 1970's British horror film. Anchor Bay or Blue Underground should acquire the rights to this film. The full title of this film is ""VENOM the Legend of Spider Forrest"" Please do not waste your money as i did on this unwatchable and unaudioable dvd.",1087603200,13,681,4.246153846153846
