2906348,4,B000TKWPPE,"This is in a documentary format and is mostly interviews of people who knew Lonnie Frisbee.  The most inspiring thing is this shows what can happen if somebody picks up a Bible, believes it, and starts doing what it says without any instruction.  If you have heard of but not understood the Jesus Movement then this will give you understanding of it and the clash with the established Christian church in the USA.",1260662400,3,413,4.6438356164383565
2906349,5,B000TKWPPE,Outstanding work.  The additional interviews were even more compelling than the movie.  Great place for starting discussions.  This is a call for all who came to Christ in the 70's and find themselves wondering what has happened since.,1256515200,,235,5.131578947368421
2906350,5,B000TKWPPE,"The Life and Death of a Hippie Preacher was first seen by us on tv, it was a documentary channel.  I was so inthrolled by the whole story about Lonnie Frisbee.  A hippie that was hungry to know the Lord and opened to be used by him, and because of that God used him in many powerful ways. It gave me hope in that you don't have to be perfect for God to use you for his glory.",1252713600,3,375,3.7948717948717947
2906351,5,B000TKWPPE,"If you still don't believe that God loves gays, watch this film about an incredible gay that God used, and had a good laugh at established religion in the process.",1249516800,4,163,4.466666666666667
2906352,5,B000TKWPPE,"Please watch this.  This true story shows clearly that God does not reject a person by his/her sexual orientation. (I am Catholic)  Further, this beautiful man was treated just as Jesus was.  Rejected by ""elders"" or whatever, even at his death.  All this despite the countless people he brought to Jesus.  We can not be the judges of people.  We have to leave that up to God. This is a  very moving, inspiring and sad story.  Listen to the Words of Jesus.  See how He loves people.  Do you ever hear Jesus reject someone who follows Him?  Or someone who looks for Him?",1405987200,4,568,4.41747572815534
2906353,5,B000TKWPPE,"I was very satisfied with this documentary. The testimonials from the people who knew this man made it even better.

Out of my puny mind and lack of understanding, I do ask, ""Why would God raise this man up, fill him with the power from on high to perform great miracles in the name of Jesus, knowing this man was gay but never healed him, and allowed him to later die of A.I.D.S.?

Lonnie Frisbee's life is a true testimony to the fact that God loves all of His creation and has His own agenda for each of our lives.",1401753600,,517,4.16
2906354,5,B000TKWPPE,"I caught the tail end of this period (I graduated in 1976) and lived through the Larry Norman & Randy Stonehill period as well (please also consider buying Fallen Angel - The Outlaw Larry Norman also a * * * * DVD).  A fair and balanced view of the life and times of Lonnie Frisbee.  I ""grew up"" first in an Assemblies of God / Church of Christ menagerie (they have nothing in common with each other and pretty much with diametrically opposed doctrine).  I eventually landed in a AOG spin off here in Salem, OR called Morningstar Community Church (kind of an ""Outlaw Independent"" Calvary Chapel...).  I also became aware of the Vineyard spin off as well which was more akin with Assemblies (ie. Pentecostal in nature... tongues et-al).  I was most comfortable with the Calvary Chapel 'low key' yet Rock & Roll approach to ministry but no longer attend.  This DVD helped me come full circle in my understanding of my own real Church history.  My dad may have been more right that I thought at the time, but I do not mean that I support his church teachings either; but that's a real Long Story ...",1401667200,,1096,4.477386934673367
2906355,5,B000TKWPPE,"This film does a wonderful job of showing what was so magical, and yet so troublesome, about that time. My only regret is that the film didn't go deeper into his psyche. I would have loved to know what really made that guy tick.",1380672000,,228,4.204545454545454
2906356,3,B000TKWPPE,"this is a great documentary from a super documentary film maker. sad, funny, and a must-see. and it is available for 20 bucks at lonniefrisbee.com",1366243200,,146,4.88
2906357,5,B000TKWPPE,"I can't believe how good this documentary was.  I'm interested in hippies, so that's why I got it.  I was quite surprised at the very believable testimony by Frisbee's friends who witnessed actual healings made through him.  One healing caused sight to be given to a blind person.  I walked into my local convenience store, this morning, and showed a friend of mine the Frisbee documentary. She, instantly, bought it from me.  She's very interested in him from another documentary.  My boyfriend said that he got chills from watching it.  I was impressed with how nicely his friends and loved ones spoke about him.  It has a sad ending.  It leaves you with a feeling of what a shame he just couldn't be his beautiful self, because when he was performing miracles and baptizing people he just emanated beautiful light.",1354924800,3,817,4.7785714285714285
2906358,5,B000TKWPPE,"I love this movie. It takes an honest look at the life and ministry of Lonnie Frisbee: a homosexual hippie Christian who was deeply influential in the Jesus people movement as well as in two large So Cal churches: Calvary Chapel and the Vineyard. I know that if God hadn't used Lonnie, my life wouldn't be the same.",1354838400,3,315,4.448275862068965
2906359,3,B000TKWPPE,"Didn't know what to expect for this story was kind of new to me. I had heard of Lonnie a few years ago, but the story presented here is a bit strange. I'm not sure if believing everything said in this film. I should know what the other parts have to say about it, like Chuck Smith and John Wimber, and not only phrases that were, maybe, took out of its context. Anyway, it's interesting to know how God could use a person like Lonnie.",1325376000,,434,4.117647058823529
2906360,5,B000TKWPPE,"After watching the film (I loved) it only made sense to get soundtrack seeing as I loved the music. The sounds are original and definately in tune with the 70's theme, it didn't take me long to know the words of every track.",1295913600,,224,4.232558139534884
2906361,5,B000TKWPPE,"This was such an entertaining film to watch. It was much more interesting to what I expected and I have watched it more than once since my original purchase. The story is deep and covers a real issue in a passionate, capturing way. This is definitely I film I would recommend if you're looking for something a little bit different to your normal style.",1295913600,,352,4.515625
8209993,5,B000TKWPPE,I have great respect for Lonnie Frisby. I believe he is a great person. I hope he has peace. He helped many people find peace.,1519862400,,126,4.08

8209995,5,B000TKWPPE,"For anyone wanting to declare war on their own legalistic mindset....here you go.
It truly puts to the test our declaration that God is foremost a God of grace.
That His gifts and favor should be distributed thus is only a greater offense to our legalistic sensibilities, but there you have it.
I love this film. Love, love, love this film. It shines a white, hot spotlight on all my legalistic, works-driven corners and challenges me to accept a God who is far more about love than I'm comfortable with. I double dare you.",1504051200,,523,4.574468085106383
8209996,5,B000TKWPPE,"Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. For those of us from that era....even if we lived in another country (Australia) the images bring back many memories. Lonnie's story is an important one on so many levels and kudos to David Di Sabatino for digging up all the facts and putting them together so beautifully.  It's true that it is so easy for the church to dismiss, ignore or deny the histories of those of us who served God and the church with all our heart and soul but happened to be gay. There is but one Judge. A valuable lesson for the church still today.

8209997,5,B000TKWPPE,One of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Thank you for making it! So absolutely great! A very excellent story.,1493942400,,117,4.619047619047619
8209998,5,B000TKWPPE,Beautiful and heart wrenching at the same time.  I love to hear stories of real people who encounter our mighty Savior and follow him with abandon.  Learning about Lonnie Frisbee's life and ministry stretched my understanding of the beauty and grace of our awesome God.,1443916800,,269,4.955555555555556
8209999,5,B000TKWPPE,An excellent documentary about a person that was an ordinary person that was used by God. The Director David Di Sabatino did a terrific job working through the complexities of a Christian who was a homosexual that was out of embarrassment rejected and castaway from two different denominations. But the good news is that God uses whom God uses. I highly recommend this documentary.,1433462400,,381,4.96875
8210000,4,B000TKWPPE,"Others have described this unusual movie better than I can. I'll just concur that the extras video on the DVD is essential. It's almost as long as the very short movie itself is. It actually contains a lot more information than the movie does because it leaves out the obscure, annoying and completely irrelevant songs that pepper the movie and eat up at least a third of its under-one-hour run time. The only sad thing about the extras video is that it adds an ugly, bitter, deluded side to his otherwise interesting and sympathetic wife Connie (I love her for being outraged at Chuck Smith's egregious smugness at Lonnie's funeral).

I'll also add that I am myself a gay Christian (very emphatically and uncompromisingly both), a year older than Lonnie Frisbee. My life too has been entirely transformed by Jesus (who loves gay men, by the way) and informed and infused by the marvelous Holy Spirit, and I too passed through Calvary Chapel along the way. For some reason I survived the experience that fatally wounded him, but then I was never on the front lines in the same way he was, as Jesus was, and as surprisingly few others have been.

I had never heard of Lonnie (Smith and his disciples have very successfully purged him from their history), so I'm grateful to this movie for introducing us. I love and admire and thank Lonnie for all he did, and I'm eager to meet him face to face before too much longer. He's better off now than any of us are.",1426809600,,1457,4.557251908396947
8210001,5,B000TKWPPE,great movie. recommend it to anyone interested.,1421625600,,47,5.857142857142857
8210002,5,B000TKWPPE,"Touching.
A little one-sided, but so are most documentaries. The music is great, interviews extensive, and does seem to provide a fair depiction of Lonnie's life.
In viewing some of his later sermons on youtube, you do see Lonnie take a rather rancorous view of his past, but really, who wouldn't after all the bad occurred. He seemed (I infer) to have a hard time forgiving those who hurt and used him.
Even if you have no idea who this is, this DVD will blow your mind about what God is capable of, and who he can use to do His work. I didn't know who Lonnie is before I saw this, and now I will never forget him.
Loved this!",1414972800,,627,4.190082644628099
