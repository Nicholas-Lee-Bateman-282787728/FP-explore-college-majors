The first series aired in May and June 2006 in a pre-watershed timeslot on BBC One --- The second series was moved to 9 p.m. Low ratings saw the last two episodes moved to a 10.40 p.m. timeslot --- In July 2007, the cancellation of the series was announced --- This left an unresolved cliffhanger from the second series, with the audience left unaware of whether Jack survived a car crash.

Great job by Koch Vision --- looking forward to more high quality titles from the BBC Collection film market --- order your copy now from Amazon or Koch Vision where there are plenty of copies available on DVD, stay tuned once again for top notch releases --- where they are experts in releasing long forgotten films and treasures to the collector.
