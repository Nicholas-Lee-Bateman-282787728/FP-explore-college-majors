5011755,2,B006OZKX02,"The bluray discs for First Class and  Wolverine didn't work. This was very frustrating for my wife and I- though it might have been our bluray player, we're pretty sure it was the discs. We would have returned them had we not used the digital discs and the other 3 of the collection hadn't worked either (which thank God they did).",1351555200,,331,4.426229508196721
5011756,4,B006OZKX02,It's all the current X-Men movies on Blu-Ray. It's cheaper than buying each on separately but the draw back is no digital copy.,1351382400,,127,4.565217391304348
5011757,4,B006OZKX02,"This collection was great for me tying the different X-Men stories together, and making them complete. I love sci-fi, and action movies, and the collection satisfied both for me completely.",1351296000,,189,5.333333333333333
5011758,5,B006OZKX02,"Surpasses anything a fan of the original comic series could ever imagine.  Great writing, excellent casting, stayed as true to the original as possible.  Second greatest comic book movie only to the Avengers!",1351209600,,208,5.2727272727272725
5011759,5,B006OZKX02,The bluerays are  crystal clear with amazing sound. They were packed nicely and came on time. It's nice to do business with pros.,1350432000,,129,4.608695652173913
5011760,4,B006OZKX02,"Note: I have two Blue-ray/ DVD players. One is ""Region A or 1"" (the norm in the US) and the other is ""Region Free"" so that I can play anything I want in it (including Region A's or 1's).  My Panasonic ""Region Free"" is only about a year old.

These Blue-ray disks has great a picture & sound.  How good the movie is I leave up to each person.  However, I do have a WARNING for everyone.

I just discovered that some of the ""Region A or 1"" Blue-ray disks that I bought on ""Amazon"" will not play in my ""Region Free"" player.  But they play just fine in ""Region A or 1"" player.

Most of the disks that will not play in my ""Region Free"" player will display a ""Fox"" back ground with a message that reads [This disc has been coded for Region A only and will not play in this machine. Please eject this disc and play on a Region A player.] on the screen after you insert the disk.  The others that will not play in ""Region Free"" player have different backgrounds with a similar massage.

*****Four of these five Blue-ray disks happen to have this problem!
  Only ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine would play in both players.

Since I have one of each this is not a problem for me, but I thought it would be useful to know for those who might only have a ""Region Free"" player.",1349395200,7,1258,4.152892561983471
5011761,4,B006OZKX02,"This is a bundle of five X-Men movies.  Please note that this is not a box set, it is just the five movies sold together - each movie comes in its own separate blu-ray case. Video/audio quality varies by disc, but is generally excellent; these discs also include a variety of special features that take you behind the scenes of the making of the movies.

The X-Men movies hold and important place in film history; the first film in the series is often credited as the film that launched the golden age of comic book superheroes on film.  Both the original X-Men and it's sequel, X2: X-Men United, are well regarded among audiences.  The final film in the trilogy, X-Men: The Last Stand, is not nearly as good as its predecessors - but it's still a fun movie with great action sequences.

Also included in the bundle is the spin-off titled X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which looks at the early days of Logan (perhaps the most popular character in the franchise).  And finally, X-Men: First Class is a prequel which examines the history between Professor Charles Xavier and his friend (turned adversary) Magneto.

My own opinion is that the X-Men films are not quite on the level of Nolan's Batman trilogy or Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.  However, these movies are very entertaining, and there are interesting themes related to society's acceptance/rejection of the mutants that parallel our own problems.  In terms of technical achievement, I would single out the costume design and the makeup work as top-notch.

If you've never seen the X-Men films, or if you're a fan but have yet to buy them, then this Complete Collection on blu-ray is the perfect set for you and comes highly recommended.

5011762,4,B006OZKX02,The only bad thing was that the X-Men: First Class disc wouldn't play in my blu-ray player; it gave me a message saying that the disc was for the wrong region.,1405900800,,159,4.161290322580645
5011763,1,B006OZKX02,"As with other reviewers, everything was fine with these discs until I attempted to play X-Men First Class.  I then received the error stating that the disc was region ""B"" and it won't play on my region ""A"" Blu-Ray.  Although the product description says that the Region is ""B/2""; the Editorial Reviews state ""Please note this is a UK Import that is region free and is guaranteed to play on any US Blu Ray Player.""  I give all the movies 5-Stars but my rating here is for the poorly written product description (I'm assuming they were done by the seller) and the hassle I now have in returning the product.  The funny thing is that I really only wanted X-Men First Class as I had all the other movies in DVD.  When I saw this Blu-ray package I thought, why not upgrade and see them all in better quality.",1405641600,3,803,4.3624161073825505

I agree that the description should be updated, but I also think people should have looked at the fine print, in the picture, before purchasing...

So why did I give it a 3-star review, when I didn't even purchase it? Because I wanted to keep the reviews as neutral as possible...",1378857600,4,530,4.638297872340425
