Teens are using opiates more than ever and the impact it has on their lives and the lives of those around them is dramatic. This film is designed to be viewed BY teens either in the company of their parents or within a school setting. The film is very much teens talking to teens (hey...if they won't listen to the older generation, maybe they would listen to their peers). It is designed to incite conversation. It is designed to hopefully save lives.
