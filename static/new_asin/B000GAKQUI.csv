8207103,1,B000GAKQUI,"No information was provided about the contents of the disk.  After viewing, it appears to be a single Colgate show.  It shouldn't have been that hard to say so, or to specify which one, by date or guest stars or something.
More problematic, not only is the sound quality mediocre, but the video editing for the DVD was appallingly poor.  The most obvious problem was that about 1/2 way through the disk, although the sound track continued correctly through the rest of the show, the video portion cut back to the beginning of the show, resulting in a mismatch of sound and video for half the disk.  It's like buying a ten chapter book, and just when you get interested, and turn the page to chapter six, you find that chapter one has started all over again.  Only worse, because with the sound going on through the rest of the show while the video repeats from the beginning, you couldn't even watch that portion.
Additionally, the chapter stops are all screwed up, too; clicking on the second chapter stop knocks you to the 1/2 way point (where the sound and video are all wrong), even though it purports to direct you to a place about 5 minutes into the disk.
Even if you only wanted one Colgate episode at a time, this disk would not be the way to buy it.  Try one of the other collections (I did also buy ""The Best of the Abbott & Costello Comedy Hour, Volumes 1&2"" which turns out to be produced by a different outfit, contains about 8-9 episodes, and seems to be just fine.)",1209686400,5,1480,4.422794117647059
