7893316,4,6305717265,"If you purchase this DVD because you like or at least appreciate most of the artists involved, you won't be disappointed with the performances here.  If you purchase it expecting an unending parade of ""superstars"", you probably will be disappointed.
Actually, this has become one of my favorite music DVD's exactly because of the eclectic mix of artists.  While 35 minutes is I agree too brief for a DVD, I'm not always in the mood to listen to 105 minutes of any one artist.  And even for a ""superstar"", the enjoyment is going to vary from song to song within those 105 minutes.  Somehow these selections work as a compilation.  All are enhanced by the unplugged treatment.  Hall and Oates with three acoustic guitars, drums and piano?  A refreshing, welcome revisit of She's Gone.  Hootie & the Blowfish with a string section on Hold My Hand?  Excellent, high-energy rendition of the popular hit.  Squeeze boiled down to two guitars and vocals?  Why not?  Bryan Adams rocking out on Back to You?  Keep the energy coming.  And you'll get exactly what you expect from Simon, Bennett, McCartney and Clapton.
Even though many of these recordings are several years old, the unplugged versions seem perhaps less dated than the original versions.  Overall it's an enjoyable collection that's got me looking for more in the ""Unplugged"" dvd series.",988156800,6,1341,4.897777777777778
7893317,1,6305717265,"I was excited at the prospect of having a DVD full of music from Superstars. In fact it had one or two good tracks but 35 minutes on a DVD is insulting.
Save your money and buy the artists that you like instead of this compilation",981504000,14,230,4.021739130434782
