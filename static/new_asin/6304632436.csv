903086,4,6304632436,"I've always liked Hammer films. This one was a pretty good one for
its genre (1968 I think). The movie begins with a group of passengers on a (nope not a cruise ship) converted garbage scow
maybe, with a beyond dangerous cargo that the Captain of the ship
doesn't fill them in on till they are about to sink.
They soon abandon ship and start drifting thru some pretty nasty
seaweed (it apparently is hungry). Soon they end up back on the same
ship? after drifting for days. Oh yeah there's alot of fog and gloomy
settings which make the film really eerie.
It drags in some spots but picks up with a cool scene with a giant
octopus with one glass/green eye snagging one of the babes.
There is also another scene where a nasty looking hermit crab and
a very ... off scorpion do battle. (they're very big of course)
There is no gore in this film so don't bother looking for it
But for some of you oldtimers, me included (in their 40's I mean) that British babe
Dana Gillespie is in the film too, you'll recognize her she's the
one with the nice cleavage and great body
All in all a good film I recommend it ( oh I forgot to mention there is a character by the name of El Supremo) maybe the screenwriter had too many drinks at lunch",1017273600,3,1228,4.229787234042553
903087,4,6304632436,"Ah, I remember seeing ""The Lost Continent"" in the theater as a youth.  There is one of those films where the sum is greater than the parts, especially since if you look at those parts it is all just too weird.  A cargo ship flees port ahead of the harbor patrol, carrying a cargo of stuff that explodes when it makes contact with water, which makes the storm the ship heads into a really, really bad thing.  Abandoning ship, the motley crew and odd ball passengers encounter killer seaweed and end up finding their ship again in the Sargasso Sea where they encounter monsters, a buxom wench out for a stroll and a trapped Spanish galleon carrying on the Spanish Inquisition.

What gets us through this film is the remarkably solid cast, as good as you will ever see in a Hammer film: Eric Porter (best remembered as Soames Forsyte in the black & white BBC version of ""The Forstye Saga"") as the brooding Captain Lansen, Hildegard Knef as Eva Peters the former mistress of a brutal dictator, Tony Beckley as the lush Harry Tyler, Suzanna Leigh as the spoiled blonde brat Unity Webster, Nigel Stock as her unscrupulous father Dr. Webster, and good old Jimmy Hanley as Patrick the level-headed bartender.  The opening ""love theme"" might make you want to turn this one off and certainly you do not want to think about the story too seriously, but the acting and atmosphere carry this one off.  I have a soft spot in my heart for this film, and probably in my brain as well.",989539200,6,1468,4.520754716981132
903088,3,6304632436,"The first half of this movie is straight adventure-at-sea: the seedy captain of an old rust-bucket illegally carries a cargo of high explosives; his motley crew are a mutinous lot; the passengers are all on the run from the law or their sins; and incompetence causes the ship to almost founder in a typhoon.  But instead of sinking it becomes lost in the Sargasso Sea, trapped by entangling seaweed.
The second half is pure fantasy, with sea monsters, carnivorous kelp, a lost civilization living on derelict ships, descendants of the Spanish Inquisition still practicing their medieval profession, and a rebellion brewing among the slaves.  In short, a swashbuckling saga of the bizarre kind, done up in the usual Hammer style, making low-budget movies look lavish on the screen.
I saw this movie at the old Paulo Drive-In in 1968.  The drive-in has been gone now for about 20 years but I still remember it and some parts of this movie quite well.  I remember the green-eyed monster with its obscene maw, and the big-breasted girl Sarah (Dana Gillespie) walking on the kelp bed with two big balloons on a harness supporting the weight of her very own two big balloons!  And, of course, I remember Hildegarde Knef, still very lovely at the age of 43 when this movie was made.  And apparently she's still active in films today, at the grand old age of 75!  And probably still lovely, too!  But evidently Dana Gillespie and her big balloons retired from the industry in 1990, the year of her last movie role.
So I was glad to see this movie again, on DVD, to refresh my memory, and with extra ""adult"" footage that it didn't have when I first saw it.  Don't buy this DVD thinking that you're going to see any ""adult"" scenes, though!  You're not!  There's no nudity at all here and the sex is suggested, not shown.  Unfortunately, also, the image quality is not the best.  Many scenes are dark and murky.  But the image is still sharp enough and the sound is good.  Bonus features are the standard chapter index, trailer, TV spots, and Hammer films promo.  Not bad, but only a Hammer film fan would love it. A little pricey, too, for what it offers.",987984000,20,2145,4.620052770448549

It would be just my luck to book passage on a ship like this....Passengers that are on the run from various illegal acts, a crew that would rather take it's chances in a lifeboat, a Captain that oozes sarcasm and a trip straight to a lost continent; complete with man-eating seaweed, mutated crustaceans and the Spanish Inquisition!  This film is *B* entertainment, pure and simple.  This is easily one of my favortie Hammer films, I love the look and feel of this film, the sea monsters, the wild array of passengers and the opening theme to this film will definitely have you singing along for days.  If you've watched your way through Hammer's Frankenstein, Dracula and Mummy series of films, then why not sit back and enjoy this sci-fi/fantasy/horror film?  I guarantee you, this will be a film you'll never forget and if you think I'm kidding, just listen to that opening theme....*You have discovered the Lost Con-tin-ent!*.",985910400,31,1010,4.815028901734104
903090,2,6304632436,"The film starts aboard a steamer which is carrying a few passengers and (unknown to all, but the captain)illegal explosives.  A storm comes up and most of the crew abandons the ship.  The remaining crew and passengers end  up in a sort of graveyard of old ships and debris.  They run into killer  seaweed, a shark (we only see a fin) and other strange creatures.  Eventually they discover a group of Spanish conquistadors who are trying to  pull the ship's crew into serving them.  This lopsided script falls  apart as it goes along, there are a number of annoying characters and the  story goes from the improbable to the ridiculous.  The monsters in this  film are terrible!  Hammer often did a good job of making a film look more  expensive than, but instead of just giving brief glances they decided to  give us close-ups of these ""creatures"" that look like rejects  from an Irwin Allen show. The good points of this film are that it is not  boring, it does have some good action and moves along fairly well. The cast  also deserves credit for keeping straight faces throughout this film and  really giving their best effort even when they faced hoses disguised as  seweed, rubber monsters and balloon shoes.

903167,2,6304632436,"Another peg in the impressively goofy Jenga tower of horror/monster flicks from the classic UK Hammer Films production line.

If you're a fan then no more need be said. Enjoy.

However, if you're like myself, an occasional traveler that only quickly darts across their territory, then an explanation is required. More so since the laughable misnomer of a title certainly doesn't reflect the floating seaweed monster based on the real-life Sargasso Sea. And there's not a continent in sight. <g>

On her final voyage, tells the tale of a beaten hulk of a transport ship carrying a secret cargo of extremely hazardous chemicals. And while shipping the illegal explosives is the ship's bread-n-butter client, it also makes some extra money for her retiring captain by ferrying a small handful of passengers. In this case, passengers who are desperate to leave Freetown, Sierra Leone at all costs - even if it means their chances of being blown up in an explosion are about dead even versus going back to land.

What they don't realize is that for many - the secreted chemicals are nothing more than a red herring of Fate. Their real destinies are much more twisted and more terrifying than any journey traveling with a cargo full of explosives.

Despite the warning of an oncoming hurricane and the beaten ship already struggling, the captain pushes on. No surprise as she reaches the storm, The Corita loses power and begins to drift. Tossed around like a float toy and fearful that she'll go down in the massive storm, and exposing the water-volatile cargo to the ocean, her crew abandons ship.

Now lost at sea, a slow tortuous death by dehydration begins. Until the survivors reach what appears to be a vast network of sea grass. Uncharted and unnoticed by modern mariners - they're caught in and amongst many other trapped vessels. Some recent, others hundreds of years old.

And unfortunately, the sea grass isn't grass at all.

Now the crew and passengers have to confront other desperate survivors of ships trapped over the years, hungry giant crustaceans, a twisted cult of zealots, and a monster that George Lucas surely must have seen as a young man.

Taken as a whole, and importantly, with a proper mindset with requisite expectations - then a passable ninety minutes of ridiculous monster/horror fluff can be gained. As I'm not a fan of such and could've spent the time screening something better, I'm going to leave this with two-and-a-half stars as a standalone film. But with an important asterisk.

That asterisk being: Once again, if you're a fan, no more need be said. Enjoy with your favorite beverage and snack. Maybe invite some friends over. Importantly, don't forget to pick up several large helium balloons and a ball of twine for everyone to enjoy. ;-D

Personal Note:

For a contemporary comparison and a measure of how I gauge this film, check out 'Starship Invasions' from 1977 starring Christopher Lee and Robert Vaughn on YouTube. Now that - that's a 1-Star steaming pile.",1379808000,,3001,4.897435897435898
903168,5,6304632436,"I loved this. A film that starts out Noir/Moody (tramp steamer carrying a dangerous cargo and passengers with a past, heading into a storm) and ends up trapped in the Sargasso Sea, along with disintegrating sailing ships and people descended from their original crews. The sudden swerves in the story make sense while you're watching it, the way it does in a bad dream. Also beautiful women, violence and amusingly bad sea monsters.

903172,2,6304632436,"I used to know a guy at the flea market. I bought into his ""B-Movie"" marketing for a while. I would buy B movies from him that were on vhs tape or the occasional dvd. Some were decent, some were not so great, some you had to find the value in. I feel ""The Lost Continent"" this Hammer film falls in the the last category. This is a movie where you have to search for the redeeming value. To be honest, I ended up fast forwarding the movie about half way through. The voyage on the ocean seemed to go on forever. The music in the movie is awful. The acting is equally awful. All of the people in the movie are boring and I failed to find really any attractive people. I'm not so shallow as to NEED pretty people in a movie, but in a movie this lame and boring it would have helped. The girl in the movie has been described as attractive by some but just having left youtube I have to say that she is just as I remembered her in the movie. She looked like an ugly old broad. I remember the point where the ship had a leak and water was pouring into the ship. The crew was frantically trying to move some chemical which was in drums away from the water which was spraying everywhere. The water would react with the chemical. +
Of course somehow that disaster was averted, or I think it was. Later, the ship is trapped in the Sargasso Sea, in some seaweed mat. This is also where they encountered some old Spanish sailing ship,(still populated with PIRATES,) that had been stuck in the seaweed for about 100 years. The ship was also still populated with the descendants of the original sailors/Pirates. It's like people have said, you have to LOVE STUPID MOVIES, and you have to see such stupidity on film to believe it, if you can. One thing I couldn't forget from this movie was the floating balloons that the people wore on their arms that kept them out of the sea and left them LIGHT enough to walk on the seaweed. I don't remember much after that. Throw in lots of bad acting and a supremely bad plot and this is some of what is The Lost Continent. This movie is for FANS of this sort of B MEDIA. I would like to have found this movie campy, some sort of silliness that had some redeeming value. Mostly I felt as if I was being tortured or something.

The movie is really bad. Maybe I'll watch some of it again someday but with so many millions of better movies I'm not worried much about returning to The Lost Continet. It probably also helps if you are a fan of British movies. That is probably one reason why I couldn't really connect with the sensibility of this movie. Mostly the movie seemed beyond preposterous.",1353801600,,2618,4.257028112449799

903175,3,6304632436,"If ever a movie deserved the accolade ""you've got to see it to believe it"" than this version of THE LOST CONTINENT (not to be confused with the 1951 B movie) is it. It isn't that it's really bad (though parts of it are) or that it lacks action (hurricanes, explosions, maneating crabs), it's just that the screenplay is truly bizarre. The setting is a tramp steamer and the film starts off like SHIP OF FOOLS with each passenger having a background story then it turns into THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE when a hurricane strikes (except the ship doesn't tip over). Next up it's Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT as our passengers are adrift for awhile before being reunited with their ship. Throw in a little sci-fi as the ship is trapped in a current of killer seaweed that takes them to a ship's graveyard where they encounter a lost civilization of Spanish Inquisitors (before MONTY PYTHON), some phony giant crabs similar to those in a forgotten 1953 adventure film PORT SINISTER (not to mention Roger Corman's ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS), and you have a movie that defies description although I did my best.

Fortunately LOST CONTINENT is loaded with some imaginative and creative low budget effects that after awhile you begin to enjoy like a kid at a Saturday matinee. The art direction and camera lighting are also highly inventive (and occasionally cheesy) and that makes certain scenes quite memorable. Adding gravitas to this rather unweildy opus are Eric Porter as the ship's captain and Hildegard Neff as a passenger that he falls for. This may not be Shakespeare or Pinter but they treat it as if it were and that's loads of fun as well. A solid cast of British character actors and a lost civilization woman with astonishing attributes keep things moving along nicely or help to distract us from what's going on. Michael Carreras (son of Hammer head James Carreras) took over direction from Leslie Norman (X THE UNKNOWN) when he left the project which may account for the film's occasional schizophrenic quality. LOST CONTINENT remains a one of a kind film from Hammer and is definitely worth seeking out. It may not be a good film, but it's an unforgettable one.",1281916800,7,2159,4.7882037533512065

903249,1,6304632436,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

Frankenstein Created Woman

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,3,1640,4.592465753424658
903250,5,6304632436,"So I give up already. Where is the lost continent?

Is it somewhere hidden in the Sargasso Sea under all that man-eating seaweed? Does it have to do with that floating Spanish galleon where characters still dress as if they have been lost in time for centuries, ruled by a spoiled little child -- the El Supremo, as one character calls him?

That said, I have to admit that this little film from Hammer is one of my guilty pleasures. It is undeniably my favorite adventure from the vaults of Hammer, starring a cast that succeeds in making us forget the unreal monsters and the fact that the shark fin sailing through the water is less than believable. What makes this film work are the stalwart efforts of the aforementioned cast, headed by pock-faced Eric Porter as a convincing captain of a tramp freighter lost not near a lost continent but caught in seaweed and facing a crew of throwbacks to the pirate area. Also making the plot almost acceptable are Suzanna Leigh, who has a bone or two to pick with her father, Hildegard Knef, who still looks pretty good considering it has been a few years since she played opposite Gregory Peck in THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO, and Tony Beckley, who reforms from a useless drunk into a guilt-ridden hero. Also on hand is one of the greatest supporting actors ever to grace a Hammer production -- Michael Ripper.

Others worth mentioning are Benito Carruthers as the agent chasing after Hildegard Knef who made off with negotiable bonds from a dictator but who is not above accepting sexual favors from her as a bribe. Also a person not to be ignored in the film is Dana Gillespie, who plays two noteworthy roles in the film -- that is, if one counts her considerable frontal attributes as characters. As a runaway from the El Supremo dictator who must travel across the threatening seaweed held up by two balloons -- no, it's not what you are thinking -- I mean real balloons-- and ends up being romanced by the Tony Beckley character. Lucky Tony. He spurns the beautiful Suzanna Leigh, who prefers him as a drunk, only to fall into the arms -- I said ""arms"" -- of the statuesque Ms. Gillespie. I understand that she was being groomed to be a rock singer -- not that anyone who sees this film is going to care. For those Russ Meyer types who are curious, she also appears in MAHLER and THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT.

Even Porter, after making some acidic comments about her relationship with her son, ends up with Ms. Neff. As I said, she still looks pretty good, even in shorts, so he is hardly a loser in the film. After THE FORSYTHE SAGA on TV, he deserves some compensation as a good guy with ulterior motives for carrying a dangerous cargo and even more dangerous passengers on his rust bucket of a freighter. He later shows up in the Hammer horror film called HANDS OF THE RIPPER, but somehow his role in that film fails to match his performance in this adventure.

Neil McCallum as his second-in-command looks weird with blond hair. Why did he decide to look like a bleached towhead for this role? Does it serve some aesthetic purpose that is lost on me? As it turns out, he is drop-kicked out of the story early, preferring to abandon ship with some of the unruly crew who fear the Phosbo-B cargo and, therefore, missing out on the opportunity to meet the time-lost
characters in the Sargasso Sea as well as the visible charms of Ms. Gillespie.

Sargasso Sea. Okay. That brings me back to my original question. Why is this adventure with strong characters called THE LOST CONTINENT?  It is nothing like the original Cesar Romero film of the early fifties with the same title, a film resembling not a little Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic THE LOST WORLD. The basis for this film is the Dennis Wheatley novel UNCHARTED SEAS.  That title makes more sense, but maybe it is not a compelling one. Why not THE LOST SARGASSO SEA? Why THE LOST CONTINENT?

By the way, the title song with its organ-music lead-in is really quite good. Too bad it wasn't used more throughout the film. We hear quiet strains of the theme occasionally, but the vocal is not repeated.

Another question: what do the prehistoric creatures -- apparently machine-driven paper-mache types -- have to do with the ship-load of throwbacks? Why do they still exist in the Sargasso Sea? I like monsters as much as the next over-grown kid, and I would prefer these unreal things to CGI or the blown-up iguanas used in the 1960 THE LOST WORLD, but how are they to be explained? Maybe we shouldn't care.

When I first saw this film in a drive-in in the last sixties, it was paired with the big-budgeted sequel to PLANET OF THE APES titled BENEATH  THE PLANET OF THE APES. I went to see this double-bill twice, and it sure wasn't to see BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES a second time. Okay. You got me.

It was to see Dana Gillespie again.

Hammer was a movie production studio in Great Britain, back when Britain was still pretty great. They made what I consider highbrow horror cheese. Highbrow because it generally had great atmospherics, and either reference to history, literature or folklore. This one is an exceptionally good example of the breed.

The motley collection of perverts and ne'er do wells on the doomed ship are marvellous B-movie character studies. The desperate captain, the dorky first mate, the drunk, the sexbomb, the pervert, the plucky ship's engineer, the woman on the lam; you love them and hate them. There are cheesy monsters, lost continents, killer plants, psychological drama and evil Spanish heretical fascists who are dealt with using that great friend of all proper Englishmen, the Lee-Enfield bolt action rifle. The title is evocative of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and I suppose it is sort of Dennis Wheatley (the writer, who wrote many of Hammer's better films) take on a Burroughs story.

You don't really watch such movies. You drink beer and eat nachos with your pals while you watch this in the background. You hiss and cheer and slap your knee at the good parts and the bad villains, and you enjoy the way these admirable misfits deal with really scary things like giant scorpions or 16th century nazi papist Spaniards in KKK uniforms. There are movies you pay close attention to; those have their place, but unless you're dead, one must watch cowboy and indian type entertainments.

A first mate who must have used Clairol Blond 4-32574X 013 box and can't be decisive.  You have a Motley Crew of old sea dogs along with a passenger list of people who are running away from their pasts: including a manly but handsome Barbara Streisand look alike, a poorman's Michael caine and his daughter, a drunken piano player and a reject from the Rico Suave' Social Club and others.  All of them on one rusty cargo ship.  This ship ends up in trouble and the people react in various ways.  Some new comers arrive at the ship including the extremely voluptuous Sara (Dana Gillespie) who in real life is a British blues singer but in this film sounds like a scandanavian lost girl.  Lots of Killer weeds and Evil coneheads round up the cast.  I almost forgot about this one until I bought it a few years ago.  I saw this on TV when I was a kid and I am still waiting for the sequel.

Highly Recommended.  This film has a very interesting story, I would love to see a prequel as well.  Dana Gillespie is worth the price of this DVD alone.

903256,5,6304632436,"Ahhh...memories of going to the movies each week all summer long as a kid. Back in the 70s in elementary school, students were given the opportunity to purchase a set of special movie tickets for about a dollar a piece (or was it a dollar for the whole thing?) and you could go see a different movie each week. Each year there were several new/different movies, but there were at least four that came back year after year. 1. the 1966 Batman with Adam West and Burt Ward 2. Big Jake with John Wayne 3. The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and 4. Hammer Studios' The Lost Continent. I loved those four movies especially The Lost Continent with the writhing, man-eating seaweed vines and the giant crab-like monster battling the equally huge scorpion monster. Great fun. My uncle would take me every year to see all 10 movies through the summer and we always looked forward to the weeks when we'd get to see those four again. Unfortunately, I had forgotten the name of my favorite one and it took me over 20 years to finally find out what the name of that movie was (The Lost Continent). I finally found it on VHS at a video store in the mall back about 10 years ago. I wish I had known about the DVD release back when it came out...I would have bought that in a heartbeat! Lots of fun!

As good as the Reptile if not better: The photography and art direction by Arthur lawson who one the best color art direction in 1948 for the Red Shoes are the finniest of any movie made in the late 60's.  Opening tune by the Pedlers is totally inappropriate and ads to the bizzare chain of events and colors. The narrative follows a cargo ship with explosives ready to blow up in a hurricane followed by a mutiny. This is about the first 30 minutes are the best part and like its own adventure story. Later things get unpredictable beginning with a shipwreck in a junkyard type island run by the Spanish Inquisition and surrounded by man-eating seaweed. On the way some of the characters are killed in a mishap with am octopuss monster.

903318,5,6304632436,"I first stayed up to watch the Lost Continent when I was a kid. Always a fan of Hammer films, The Lost Continent is probably my favourite of all. Repeated viewings since have done nothing to diminish the film, if anything they have enhanced it. It is difficult to put this film into any single genre, it probably falls under a combination of action/fantasy/horror/sci fi.
It is based on the Dennis Wheatley novel Uncharted Seas, although there are substantial and necessary plot revisions in the film.
The story is set on a rust bucket tramp steamer - the SS Corita, carrying an illegal cargo of high explosive, a dubious collection of passengers, and helmed by a moody, sarcastic captain - a typically strong performance from Eric Porter. Supported by a solid cast, this really makes the film tick.
Among the passengers, Hildegard Knef is convincing as the wife of an exiled dictator, whom she is fleeing from. Tony Beckley plays the drunken playboy Basil. Nigel Stock plays a doctor fleeing from his dubious past, with his daughter in tow. Benito Carruthers plays a thug, sent after Knef's character. Among the crew is Neil McCallum as the pious Chief Engineer, Reg Lye as the helmsman, and Hammer regular Michael Ripper as the crew's barrackroom lawyer. The first half of the film sees the interaction of passengers and crew, the ship get damaged during a hurricane, a mutiny, and the abandoning of the ship. Later some of the crew and passengers return to the ship and this sees the second half of the film where they encounter man eating seaweed, a graveyard of ships, gigantic crustaceans and celapods, and the survivors of the previous shipwrecks, ruled over by the Spanish Inquisition.

The dvd release has 8 mins of unrealeased footage which enhances and fleshes out the film nicely, making it a more complete viewing experience.
Despite its age, the film creates a truly original and imaginative fantasy setting, with its yellow skies, swirling mists, and oceans of voracious seaweed. Hammer imported the top SFX guys from Disney for this, one of their most expensive films, to give it its unique and original look. Enhancing this is the superb psychedelic musical score of Gerard Schurmann, coupled with the great title track, performed by The Peddlers.
For sheer movie originality and escapism, this one hits the spot. Sit back and let it take you away to a vivid and frightening world of imagination, with one of the most original movie scores ever, to accompany you on the way. Simply superb.",1107648000,2,2506,4.882629107981221
903319,3,6304632436,"I just had the chance to view an old classic from Hammer Films.  I refer to The Lost Continent which was based on the book UNCHARTED SEAS by Dennis Wheatley.
A tramp steamer sets out from Africa under the control of a strange captain.  Aboard the steamer is a fortune in illegal explosives and some very desperate passengers.  So desperate are the passengers that when notified of an oncoming hurricane they decide to press onward and not turn back.  But before the hurricane hits and accident with the anchor ruptures the ships hull.  Water is pouring into the hold where the illegal phosphor is stored.  Some of the crew abandons ship in a failed mutiny.  The rest, as well as the passengers, move the deadly cargo to drier parts.  As the hurricane begins to hit the captain decides that they must all abandon ship.
Once in the life boat things get worse and stranger.  With tensions high and tempers short fights break out.  But before they can escalate to high the small craft finds itself amongst some strange seaweed.  Once the weed proves deadly the survivors become indrawn until they bump into a ship stuck in the weed.  The ship turns out to be their own and they reboard.  They drift with the weed to a graveyard of ships located amongst some uncharted islands.  Here the survivors find that others have survived as well.  Descendants of many ships manage to survive including some Spanish Conquistadores and some very hungry monsters.  A battle ensues and the ships survivors defeat the Spanish leaders and vow to keep trying to escape.
The Lost Continent was originally released in the late sixties and because of that suffers from a slow pace.  But the pace is the only fault I find with this film.  As one of Hammer's most elaborate and expensive films it stands as a classic.  To insure the films quality, Hammer Films imported Bob Mattey, the special effects master from Disney, to handle the effects.  From the film's beginning we are plunged into eeriness.  Slowly the strangeness builds and we become convinced of the captain's madness.  One of the passengers is even seen reading the Dennis Wheatley book.  The film manages to convince the viewer of how desperate the characters are; a rare accomplishment.  This one is really worth watching.",1088380800,,2263,4.77319587628866
903320,3,6304632436,"I remember seeing this flick many years back on TV; it kept my interest for the first hour and twenty minutes , right up to when the colossal creatures appeared. They were so laughable I was FORCED to tune out.

After becoming a fan of Dana Gillespie (see her in ""The People That Time Forgot"" to learn WHY), and finding out she appeared in this pic, I ended up buying it on DVD. An open-minded second-look reveals a fine adventure yarn capped off by a very moody, surreal climax.

Quite a few reviewers state that there is no lost continent in the picture; this is not true. When the cast are in the Sargasso sea area you can clearly see mountainous land in the background; in fact, a character even proclaims at one point, ""Look -- land!"" Some of the cast even end up walking on the ""lost continent"" which is where they run into the laughable monsters (giant crab, giant lobster, etc.).

WHAT WORKS: There's lots of action and adventure; Eric Porter as Captain Lansen is strong; the human-eating seaweed is a plus; the surreal sets for the orangey Sargasso Sea of shipwrecks are fantastic; Dana Gillespie is incredibly beautiful; the balloon shoes & harnesses are creative; and the plot keeps your interest even though much of the writing is weak. The distinctive 60's theme song is also pretty cool.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Except for Dana Gillespie (Sarah), the characters are all rather unlikable and the biggest flaw is that the creature F/X are horrible (did I mention that already?).

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Lost Continent"" is not hailed as one of Hammer's masterpieces, but I think the main reason for this is the lousy crustacean monsters. The flick gets extra points for its high adventure and its undeniably mood. The film will certainly be enjoyable for those of us who are attracted to ""lost continent""-type adventure flicks (just bear with the relatively short crustacean sequence). And Dana Gillespie doesn't hurt.

The film runs 89 minutes.

903322,2,6304632436,"The Lost Continent (1968), released by Hammer Studios, isn't one of their finer films, to be sure.  Co-directed by Michael Carreras, who later gave us the mobster/kung-fu Hammer flick Shatter (1974), and Leslie Norman, who was probably more known for his early TV work on the Avengers and The Saint, The Lost Continent instills a feeling of oppression on viewers from the very beginning.  Adapted from a Dennis Wheatley novel, the screenplay was adapted by a writer named Michael Nash, who has no other credits than this film, which did not surprise me at all.
The film starts off showing a rusty cargo ship that is also a passenger liner of sorts.  The vessel has obviously seen better days, and so have the passengers.  We find that the passengers are all pretty much undesirable types, who elected to take this mode of travel due to their need for anonymity, something they wouldn't have gotten on more modern, more crowded ocean liners.  We also soon discover the captain is transporting some extremely dangerous cargo, highly volatile explosives to be more specific, and this is not entirely all on the up and up, but he is being paid well and plans to retire after this voyage.  I must also note the explosives are very stable, that is, unless they come into contact with water, and then it's good night nurse.
Anyway, through a mishap, the ship's hull gets damaged, and water starts leaking into the compartment where the explosives are stored.  Good thing they are sealed in metal canisters...to top it off, a hurricane is approaching, and the pumps begin to fail.  They finally abandon ship, but end up coming back later  (I know, I know, this seems to make little sense).  They get the boat working again, but get stuck in a whole lot of seaweed.  Not only that, but there's a big, nasty one-eyed creature lucking in the seaweed, and it seems to have a taste for humans.  The boat ends up drifting with the seaweed, and it takes them to a sort of ship graveyard, full of other ships in various states of decay.
While stuck here, they get attacked by another group who had gotten trapped in the weed, and from the looks of their outfits, they've been here for a while.  We see Spanish Conquistadors, barbarian types, and even an inquisitor or two.  These guys come from another ship, a Spanish Galleon, not far away, and have come to raid this new ship for supplies and such.  Oh yeah, they've devised a method for walking on the thick seaweed that entails big floaty type booties and balloon harnesses they wear around their torso.  Oh man, is this getting goofy...anyway, the Spanish type people are led by a runt who calls himself `El Supremo', among other things, and they take part in torture and archaic religious rituals.  `El Supremo', it appears, is only a figurehead, with the real power emulating from the Grand Inquisitor...I've got to stop here...seriously, this movie just has too much silliness going on...why was this ever made?  The plot careens this way and that, the characters have no redeeming qualities, and the dialog is utterly inane.  Some effort was put into the special effects in the creation of various creatures, but with an obvious lack of resources, they come out looking like leftovers from science fiction movies from the 50's.  There is atmosphere to be found within the film, but given the lameness of the whole production, it tends to be overshadowed by all that is wrong in the film.  The actors seem quite capable, with a few exceptions, and had they been given something to work with, I am sure this could have been a much better movie.
How does it end?  Who cares?  I was just happy to see it finally ended (it runs an excruciatingly 89 minutes).  I won't even bother to go into who starred in the movie, as I am sure the more competent actors would probably just assume forget they appeared in this dog.  Anchor Bay does release a decent looking wide screen print here, but the quality of the picture does have its minor visual flaws.  Special features include a restored version with never before seen footage (oh boy, you mean the film is longer than it was originally?), a trailer, some TV spots, and a neat little 5 X 7 reproduction of the original movie poster.  I am still unsure what the title refers to, as we never really got to see a `lost continent', unless they were talking about the huge bed of seaweed.  Maybe I should just go read the book...

903323,1,6304632436,"After watching this, I'm not really sure just what I experienced, but I do know that The Lost Continent is clearly one of the worst if not THE worst Hammer movies I've seen.
First off, there was no Continent in the movie, just a bunch of ships stuck in the middle of a misty weed covered swamp.
The first 45 minutes sets up the checkered pasts of the passengers but its all meaningless set up as nothing occurs in the remainder of the movie to justify the character development.
The movie just sinks down to Davy Jones' locker after that....
- Somebody explain to me how you go back onto a ship that you had abandoned (because of a hole in the ship predictably in the hold where some unknown dangerous ""will explode if in contact with water"" cargo was stored), I assume somebody who remained on the boat repaired the hole in the hull?? I'm confused.
Unfortunately, there is basically no plot except trying to figure out who's going to survive -  I did like the balloon devices that enabled the crew to walk over the weed infested sea - that had to have taken a lot of thought.
The ""creature"" effects were laughable and embarrassingly bad.
The attempt to create a creepy Spanish Inquisistion type cult out in the middle of the ocean just plain failed - as did the entire movie.
I bought this as a 2 DVD package with ""The Reptile"" which is a much more honest Hammer offering, so its not a total loss.

After an hour of passable (and palpalbly sleazy) onboard thriller dynamics (with one actor that looks eerily like a young John Carpenter), the movie quickly evolves into an outlandish horror fantasy about a continent-sized mass of living (and biting) seaweed that drags our anti-heroes into a ship's graveyard populated by lost Spaniards.  These Spaniards are ruled by a puppet boy king and they make their way over the mushy weeds and ocean beneath by harnessing a balloon to either shoulder. It gets a little surreal, folks. The whole movie is sickly orange in a rather fetching way, and if it all feels like bargain basement ""Ship Of Fools"" meets bargain basement Lovecraft, well, I guess it should also be said the inherent smarts and adult themes that were the trademarks of Hammer studios did extend even into most of these Anchor Bay obscuities.

903325,3,6304632436,"Having read the novel ""Uncharted Seas"" by Dennis Wheatley i popped the DVD into the player and for the first time saw Hammers take of the novel, titled ""The Lost Continent"".
After reading some quite negative reviews for this film my hopes were not very high. Fortunately i was pleasantly surprised as the film was not a total loss. However there were too many changes from the novel. Firstly the heroic characters in the novel (particularly the captain, the drunk Englishman and the French officer) were totally missing in the film version. The whole explosives sub plot never occurred and was just a conveniant way of finishing the film. I did appreciate the seeweed (although not carnivorous in the novel), the squid  creature and the giant crab on the island (minus the scorpion) were taken from the novel pretty much as is. Also great was the shipwreck graveyard and the eerie orange sky. And yes the natural gas filled balloons do make sense if you have read the novel.
The ending was a bit disappointing and seemed almost rushed. This is where the film really strayed. Many people would find the novel offensive because of its portrayal of coloured people. For this reason i fully understand and support the changes made, but even so the ending was nowhere near as exciting as it could have been.
Overall a decent effort by Hammer but not as good as the other Wheatley adaptation ""The Devil Rides Out"". Its a shame ""The Haunting of Toby Jugg"" was planned but never made by Hammer, it has great potential. Well maybe one day someone will make it.",1059177600,,1551,4.702205882352941

Okay, now that that is out of my system. The film starts out on
an interesting tale of a sea captain (Eric Porter) with surly
attitude and a secret. (And this yahoo is supposed to be the star) The boat is on it's last sea leg, (sorry) and the crew is
looking for a reason to rebel.....the plot was reason enough for me. Anyhoo, Then we have the passengers, the Love Boat this aint.
These people are all running away from personal and criminal problems. They all board this rusty ship, with a crooked captain,
and his lovely crew. The captain's secret is he is carrying an
explosive material,....that detonates when it's wet. The ship is heading out to sea when they find out they're heading into a Hurricane. The crew, headed by Michael Ripper, discovers the illegal cargo when the ship developes a leak...in the hull....
where the explosives are. The passengers and the crew move the
explosives and then abandon ship. Way too many people are floating about on this raft, when they just happen to come across the ship they had abandoned earlier. Now, here's where it gets rediculous.. murderous seaweed, rubber monsters, a chick with impossibly large breasts, spanish sadists, balloon harnesses (don't ask), and a big stupid messy ending.
 The Anchor Bay version has extra footage that was cut because it was too adult, there's no nudity, but believe me if any film ever needed it, it's this one!
 The reproduction is murky and dark which made it almost impossible to see this horrible train wreck of a picture. You might be wondering why I gave it 2 stars.....Let's put it this way, one of the stars is for the widescreen presentation and the other star is for having the, um...male fortitude to actually make the film.",1038614400,2,1829,4.6770186335403725
903327,3,6304632436,"One thing I neglected to mention in my past reviews of films that were released in 1968 was this film. One that had all the makings of an Irwin Allen/Lost World type of film. The only difference between those productions and this film, is that those films made a little bit of sense. This one, very little. If anything, Hammer Films managed to tap into the surreal, hallucinogenic pop-culture of 1968 for this outing. Most of what I remember in this film would have qualified for certain episodes and settings on Space:1999 (i.e. the large octopus that nearly devours a beautiful blonde woman, and the red-tinted sky that is just above the lost island). Even the Rancor-like pit would have qualified in some respects, for an episode of the classic British science fiction series.
Either way, The Lost Continent has some interesting moments. Particularly how the Captain of the freighter is trying to smuggle some powerful explosives to another country, the first officer and some of the crew forming a mutiny when the ship is in danger of being blown apart, the passengers trying to escape some dreaded past, and the island itself, populated by descendents of the Spanish Inquisition. Even the Grand Inquisitor (frighteningly dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member) has some moments. Particularly when he stabs his own king, a young boy named El Diablo in the back with a knife.
One disturbing aspect of the film, is when someone is thrown into the Rancor-Like pit, and is eaten alive. His screams of pain and terror are very convincing. As is the shock of El Diablo and the freighter's crew watching such a monstrous event.
Filmed on location at Elstree Studios in Herts, England, the viewer is easily reminded that this film was a British production, and is easily stunned to his senses as to what the film is all about. Not only is it warped and twisted in some ways, it also, at times, interesting to watch.
What is even more interesting, is the fact that this film was G-rated in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the film was X - rated. A very unusual piece of movie trivia, indeed.
If you enjoy Hammer films and the surreal, then this film is for you. If this is not your cup of tea, then I would recommend watching something else entirely. Can anyone say Planet Of the Apes?",1026086400,,2284,4.669975186104218

Like another reviewer has stated this story does have everything, so many elements of it remind me of so many other films I don't want to take the time to name them all.
The Lost Continent is amazingly sophisticated, an absolute masterpiece.
Most of the characters are well portrayed and defined even though they exhibit some bizarre behavior, but of course this makes the story more interesting and surprising.
Tony Beckley's performance is excellent, impressively mature.
I think the most bizarre and disturbing character in this film is the satanic Marilyn Manson type dictator of the lost Spaniards. Nightmare fodder and too real.
I think a runtime of about two hours would have been better to explore all the concepts presented here. Very much potential, could easily have been expanded to a trilogy format.
A superbly impressive film. I truly enjoy its nature oriented theme.
Reminds me of another favorite, Attack Of The Mushroom People, but that film is very simple compared to Lost Continent.

This review is for the Optimum Classics Studio/Canal PAL video format release.
Video quality looks to be an almost perfect High Definition restoration and DVD not DVD-R.
Regrettably the Audio is Mono, no 5.1 or Stereo option. Too bad, it would add another dimension to this fine masterpiece and make it that much better.
The only extra is a theatrical trailer which also has been restored.

The Lost Continent is a unique experience in Cinema History, maybe the Citizen Kane of its genre, if not in a genre by itself.
