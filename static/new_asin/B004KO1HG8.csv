I would call it film noir.  The characters are varied, the plot has twists that are at once dramatic & subdued at times suprising. Vincent Minnelli certainly could make the choice of curtains in to a big deal! It was unusual to see some of the actors in these rolls. Gloria Graham (It's a Wonderful Life) is in amazing character, she makes the movie portraying the director's wife.  Tommy Rettig (Lassie) is so sweet as Richard Widmark's (Judgment at Nuremberg) wonderful son.  Widmark is the director of the sanitarium.  Oscar Levant the famous composer plays one of the patients also and does a beautiful job. Fay Wray (King Kong), John Kerr (South Pacific), Lillian Gish (The Birth of a Nation), Charles Boyer (Gaslight), all top actors of the day are at their best.  The doctors and wife of the sanatorium director obviously, perhaps predictably, belong in the hospital more than the patients do, but Widmark plays the most intelligent upright caring father and friend to all.  Lauren Bacall has a smaller roll than she had during her Bogie years, but is charming just the same. The movie is a bit slow and restrained but interesting. I streamed the movie, the film quality was not good, I had to strain my eyes to see the actors faces.  I wish I could have been able to see them better.  What a gem!",1344211200,8,1503,5.0772357723577235
4397316,4,B004KO1HG8,"William Gibson's point in his original bestseller of having all the plot shenanigans set in motion by a squabble over selecting curtains for a private sanitarium was probably that the most elaborate workplace feuds are often over trivial matters. You'd never know that, however, from this all-star MGM adaptation, because at no point does anyone state how silly a matter these curtains (invariably referred to here as ""the drapes"") really are. The drapes are everything; and after a while I found myself beginning to care deeply about them too. The hospital administrator Lillian Gish (dour and pinched) wants to install cheap drapes to save money, while the chief doctor's petulant and interfering wife (Gloria Grahame) wants to install more artistic and aesthetic ones. She, in turn, does not realize her husband (Richard Widmark) has worked out an arrangement with the occupational therapist (Lauren Bacall) to have the patients create their own drapes silkscreened from the designs of talented, suicidal John Kerr. While watching this movie, I began to form my own strong opinion of which drapes they should use based on the descriptions: when Kerr's designs are revealed to be Dufy-like portraits of the hospital staff and patients I began to get depressed, and I desperately hoped that when Grahame's drapes finally arrived they'd be worthy of her descriptions. Fortunately, they're absolutely spectacular (but they unleash more kind of chaos than could be imagined).

All this seems very fitting in a film where director Vincente Minnelli (as usual) gives as much loving attention to the color schemes of his interiors as he does to his stars' performances. Each room in the hospital and Widmark's home is designed in stunning coordinating neutrals, from the puces of Richard Widmark's office to the lavenders of his boudoir and the violets of his living room. The characters try to live up to the scale of the color schemes, which is just about impossible; only Grahame--wearing some of the most beautiful gowns in Fifties films--manages even to come close. Kerr, in his movie debut, is surprisingly intense in the kind of role Anthony Perkins usually played; while in the kind of role Agnes Moorhead usually played, Gish, cast against type, works hard in a thankless (and underwritten) role. For no clear reason, Charles Boyer is also in the film as a genial lecherous drunk on the doctors' staff. The film is fairly much a mess, but it's pretty and enjoyably entertaining (in all its silliness) just the same.",1338595200,20,2519,5.099273607748184
4397317,4,B004KO1HG8,"This movie is a great drama with a outstanding Cast (Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, John Kerr, Lilian Gish, Oscar Levant), great camera work (filmed it Cinemascope) and direction (famous from his musical ""Meet me in St. Louis"" and other dramas ""Home from the Hill"") and great script with very good dialogues.

Also starring in this movie: Tommy Rettig and Fay Wray (famous as first Scream Queen in ""King Kong"" 1933 and ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"".

Movie is remastered (!), on DVD-R Product, without any bonus-features or subtitles.

Like very much John Kerr's acting.

4397318,3,B004KO1HG8,"""The Cobweb"" is a 1955 color Cinemascope film about conditions in private psychiatric hospitals and the people who work in them. It was based on the 1954 novel of the same name by William Gibson (1914-2008). Gibson was a famous author (""The Miracle Worker"", ""Two for the Seesaw"", ""Golda"") who was married to a well known Psychotherapist which may account for his interest in psychological dramas. It's said that the hospital in the film was based on the Menniger Clinic where Gibson's wife worked.

* John Kerr - ""They said Van Gogh was crazy because he killed himself. He couldn't sell a painting while he was alive, and now they're worth twenty million dollars. They weren't that bad then and they're not that good now, so who's crazy?""

Rugged Richard Widmark plays a chain smoking Psychiatrist and the new head at a private hospital. Widmark was nominated for an Oscar and winner of a Golden Globe for his debut film (""Kiss of Death"", 1947) and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). Widmark appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero. He was a staple in Westerns - ""The Last Wagon"" (1956), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), ""Death of a Gunfighter"" (1969), etc.

* Nurse Carey - ""He has someone in for a nightcap every evening. I have to do something.""
* Widmark - ""Make sure he has clean glasses""

Lauren Bacall (1924) plays a staff member recovering from the death of her husband and son. Bacall made her sizzling film debut in ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944) and went on to co-star with husband Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" (1946) and ""Dark Passage"" (1947). She was nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA for ""The Mirror has Two Faces"" (1996) and won the Golden Globe and SAG for that film. She had 3 Emmy nominations. I think she did her best acting in ""The Shootist"" (1976) for which she received a BAFTA nomination.

Charles Boyer (1899-1978) was everyone's favorite Frenchman. He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, beginning in 1937 (""Conquest"") and ending in 1961 (""Fanny""). His most famous film is ""Gaslight"" (1944) although his performance in ""Algiers"" is often mentioned as one of his career highlights. Boyer plays the former head of the hospital and a man struggling with his own problems.

A strong supporting cast includes the staff's family Gloria Grahame (Widmark's frustrated wife), Tommy Rettig (son), and Fay Wray (Boyer's wife), members of the staff Lillian Gish (no nonsense business manager) Olive Carey (hardnosed nurse) and Paul Stewart (doctor), and patients Susan Strasberg, Oscar Levant, and John Kerr.

FWIW - Lillian Gish returned to film after a 22 year absence.

Vincente Minnelli (1903-1986) directed nearly 40 films between1942 and 1976. Perhaps he's best known for his marriage to Judy Garland (1945-51) and their child, Liza. Minnelli won an Oscar for ""Gigi"" (1958) and was nominated for ""An American in Paris"" (1951). In addition, he earned 5 DGA nominations, for those 2 and ""Bells are Ringing"" (1960), ""Home from the Hill"" (1960) and ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952).

FWIW - Minnelli often dealt with the issue of emotional disturbances in films like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Two Weeks in another Town"". And liked to do films about doctors who experiment with new methods (e.g., ""Madame Bovary"", ""Father's Little Dividend"")

* John Kerr - ""They talk about Environmental therapy. Some environment. You should see the inside. Like the inside of a dead fish.""

Director/actor/producer John Houseman (1902-88) produced this film, one of many he did with Minnelli (""Two Weeks in Another Town"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""Lust for Life""). Houseman is best known for his collaborations with Orson Welles in the 30s and 40s. Houseman produced nearly 30 films and appeared as an actor in as many. His films rarely received awards but were popular - ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), ""Julius Caesar"" (1953), ""Executive Suite"" (1954), and ""Lust for Life"".

Other films about mental hospitals include ""Private Worlds"" (1935) with Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert, Hitchcock's 1945 thriller ""Spellbound"", Boris Karloff and Anna Lee in ""Bedlam"" (1946), ""The Shrike"" (1955), ""David and Lisa"" (1962), Joan Crawford's ""The Caretakers"" (1963), Sam Fuller's ""Shock Corridor"" (1963), ""Marat/Sade"" (1967), ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), and ""Girl Interrupted"" (1999). Other films about treatment for mental illness at that time include ""Home of the Brave"" (1948) and ""The Three Faces of Eve"" (1957).

* Gloria Grahame - ""Are you being helped here?""
* John Kerr - ""How would I know?""
* Gloria Grahame - ""If you don't know, who would?""

In 1955  ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"".

* Lillian Gish - ""Do you think we can get along better?""
* Widmark  - ""Sure. My terms are simple. Unconditional surrender.""

The NY Times said the film was ""plushily produced"" and had ""an uncommonly good cast"" but called it a ""shrill and slightly horrifying peep at a streamlined, isolated `rest home'"" and ""a fitfully engrossing but oddly superficial and lurid melodrama."" Pauline Kael in The New Yorker called it ""enjoyable in an almost campy bad-movie way.""

* John Kerr - ""Everybody's troubled here. You can't tell the patients from the doctors.""
* Gloria Grahame - ""I can""
* John Kerr - ""How?""
* Gloria Grahame - ""The patients get better""

There are a lot of ironic elements with the cast and the film. Sweet Lillian Gish plays a hard nose. Rugged Richard Widmark plays an intellectual. B film seductress Gloria Grahame plays a dutiful frustrated wife. There's as much emotional upset and turmoil among the staff as the patients, and the central plot point, the economics of a set of drapes is mirrored by the use of cheap color processing (Eastman vs. Technicolor) in the film itself. While it is supposed to be about treatment in a private psychiatric hospital, most of the time and most of the trouble is among the staff. It's as if the film was one big in joke by Minnelli, which might make for a few laughs, but doesn't further the film.

Bottom line - not a bad film, but clearly more concerned with the lives of the staff than the lives of the patients.",1316217600,4,6533,4.903898458748866

4397323,4,B004KO1HG8,"I'm surprised to see so few reviews of a film which  in its day was much commented about regardless of how much or little money it earned. Richard Widmark and Lauren Bacall were (deservedly) top names while Charles Boyer and Lillian Gish were very long time favorites as well as fine actors. Oscar Levant, of course, was never a Star in the movies although he was a major attraction as a concert pianist and had made films with Astaire, Kelly, Ginger Rogers and others; he has also played second banana on radio with Al Jolson after his ""biographical"" film with the persona of Larry Parks was a smash hit in the mid-forties. The setting was also rather distinctive in that day for a serious picture: a home for the mentally ill. Such settings were more likely to be found in comedies or horror films than in straight drama.
At any rate, the movie retains its interest as a clash between an ""innovative"" young psychiatrist and a more traditional staff, although the distinction is much blurred with no strong advocate being on screen for the latter. The essential drama is centered on the ability of the new Director to impose his will on a number of well-established long term employees and on his ability to find a home-work balance adequate to the needs of both. This latter theme was still in process of coming to the fore as social norms began a tendency to shift from the job comes first above all to the notion that due attention need be paid to the home front.
This is not among Widmark's better roles, but he does his usual professional job of making us feel the conflicts through which his character is moving. As always, I felt something missing in Gloria Grahame's performance; there is always a stiffness, not only of facial features but of body as well, that makes her seem artificial. In a surprisingly small role, Lauren Bacall does well though the aborted affair she has seems to have a rather stunted, afterthought, quality to it. Boyer, when younger, limited to romantic roles in
American films, although a  first rate screen and stage actor (I saw him on the stage a few times), here is given some, but not much, room to show his talent. Oscar Levant does Oscar Levant in a few scenes. Two young stars were allowed some room as well, John Kerr and Susan Strasberg  (whom I saw on Broadway as Anne Frank...wonderful performance). The latter wasn't given much to do but the former had adequate time to make an impression. Lillian Gish, of course, made the most of her role and added a salty flavor to the movie.
Times and norms have changed a good bit since the 50's, but I think this is still a film which will entertain for two hours of an evening. Nothing here to shock tender sensibilities.",1418688000,,2711,4.585567010309278

More to the point, we learn that the ""normal"" staff carry as much emotional baggage as the unhealthy patients. Richard Widmark plays the chief doctor who is devoted to his job and to his children, but seems to have a blind spot when it comes to his own wife's (Gloria Grahame) emotional needs. Charles Boyer, Lauren Bacall, and John Kerr, also reveal sufferings, insecurites, and fears that make us human.
