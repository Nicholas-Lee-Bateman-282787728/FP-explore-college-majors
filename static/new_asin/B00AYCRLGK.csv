8559164,4,B00AYCRLGK,"KAZOKU NO KUN! (OUR HOMELAND).  HIGH DRAMA!

Director: Yonghi Yang
Theater (CineMatsuri 2015)
2012
Rating = ****

Full disclosure: Viewed in a theater during CineMatsuri 2015.  Film = four (4) stars; subtitles three (3) stars.  Korean Japanese Director Yonghi Yang's semi-autobiographical film is a wrenching experience.  Perhaps, it is the most dramatic Japanese film of this Century so far.  It depicts the incurable anguish of Korean Japanese  families torn apart by forced exile (""repaternization"") to either one of the Koreas at the end of WWII.  Korean brought to Japan during and before the war as well as those born in Japan lost their resident immigration or citizenship status, and had to return to their ""homeland.""  Events in this movie clearly channel the current status of immigration in the USA.  Direction and screenplay are excellent.  Pauses (which usually turn out to be plain boring in the hands of other directors) are poignant and exploited to add immensely to the overall dramatic impact of the photoplay.  Leading actress Sakura Ando delivers some of the best dramatic acting seen on the Japanese screen today!  Cinematography (1.78 aspect ratio, color) is overly jittery for hand-held cameras (used exclusively), and often distracting.  Bolt-on music occurs during the opening and closing credits.  Subtitles do not distort line reading, but are a bit on the long side.  Only above-the-line names are translated in the credits (which seems to be an insult--perhaps not intended--to the many others who contributed to the making of this fine film).  The audience applauded at the end.  Highly recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1427414400,,1653,5.308880308880309
8559165,5,B00AYCRLGK,"Actually, I haven't seen this DVD release. But the film itself is excellent. Subtle but powerful based-on-truth story of Korean-Japanese family who unwittingly sent their sons to live in Kim Il Sung's ""socialist paradise"" in the DPRK, in the 1960s, when they were facing discrimination in Japan, and didn't yet know the horrors that would later befall the people of North Korea. This film (made by the daughter, who became a filmmaker in order to tell their story), here condenses multiple brothers (two or three?) into one - who is ill and gets permission to come (back) to Japan temporarily for treatment; However, his wife and child were required to remain behind - so he MUST return, and cannot request political asylum (the DPRK also sent along a ""minder"" to be with him all the times). The subtle, non-melodramatic, but well-played emotions felt by the family - especially the parents, who now realize the virtual prison that they unknowingly sentenced him to, are quite profound.

This was Japan's Oscar submission last year, and, after I saw it at the Palm Spring International Film Festival, I believed it could, and should, have gotten one of the five nomination slots for Best Foreign Language film. Sadly it did not.

To add insult to injury, this DVD appears NOT to have any English subtitles - so most non-Japanese speakers worldwide still do not have the opportunity to view this powerful and well-made film.

Would some small distributor reading this PLEASE release this outstanding drama on an all-region DVD in the U.S. or U.K. with ENGLISH SUBTITLES! PLEASE! (btw, I am not in any way associated with the production of this film, nor do I know anyone associated with it. I am just a lover of quality films, who is heartbroken when good ones are not released.)",1419638400,,1778,4.861386138613861
