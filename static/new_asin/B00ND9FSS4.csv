8677521,4,B00ND9FSS4,This was one of my favorite childhood movies. It's a great movie for younger children. The only downside to this movie is that it is a vhs. I personally think the quality of video is way better on the DVD version but the movie it's self is great.,1509667200,,246,4.145833333333333
