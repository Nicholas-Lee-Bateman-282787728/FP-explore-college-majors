8197351,1,6304953003,"The problem with this 1966 film ""Hidden Agenda Vol. 4, Anarchy USA: In The Name Of Civil Rights"" - it's just the sort of propaganda it claims to unmask. On the one hand this film makes very very clear the US civil rights movement of the 1960's was supremely just and sorely needed. Then the film proceeds to brand even MLK's peaceful freedom marches as the work of Communist subversives and their useful idiots. Got logic? The film's argument is a logical contradiction. The fact Communists sought to exploit ""self-determination of Negroes in the black belt"" and infiltrate the civil rights movement is meaningless when Justice itself demanded that movement. By this film's logic, if a Communist votes for you, or attends your poker night, or spots you a twenty, you're ipso facto a useful idiot and tool of Communism. I won't call this film a subtle racist rant but you certainly could.

The director, G. Edward Griffin, is not without merit. He has published works on alternative medicine (vitamin B16) and also a famous study on the Federal Reserve,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Creature-from-Jekyll-Island-A-Second-Look-at-the-Federal-Reserve/dp/091298645X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve</a>.

The real ""hidden agenda"" in this 1966 film would appear to be the film itself, a propaganda smear of the civil rights movement. It needn't have been but the argument is subtly thus crafted. Being a hit piece on the civil rights movement, tossing MLK in the same cooking pot with Marx and Lenin, this film serves up unsavory stew. But it could make a good topic in an academic course designed to study propaganda methods, for it's a fine example of the logical fallacy of guilt by association. The film is guilty of the very Marxist naughtiness it condemns.",1408924800,2,2424,6.254491017964072
