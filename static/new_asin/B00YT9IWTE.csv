7267837,1,B00YT9IWTE,"let me begin with the fact that I wanted to like this and on any level. if it were a bad fun movie, if it was decent it didn't matter, I wanted to like it. I wanted to like Jordan Farris and I kind of did, I think he would have been better with more to work with. having said that.....AWFUL to everyone and everything else. The other actors were horrendous and so was the script the direction the entire production. The mad scientist and the kid Igor, dear God where did we dig them up from. The girlfriend, I just can't believe how bad the acting was, I didn't even get the silly vibe or the campy vibe or the over-the-top vibe.....just the bad vibe.",1451001600,,651,4.174603174603175

7267841,2,B00YT9IWTE,"Good intentions and enough of a budget are not enough..
With a different director, editor and different (better) actors, a seriously tightened script this indeed could have been a fun, ""campy"" little indie sci-fi..
..
This was one of those rare occasions where I watched too much to quit but sadly, it just continued to spiral down the rabbit hole to the point I was too numb to reach the power button on the remote..
If you've no choice in the matter and your destined for a viewing, you can reduce some of the damage by downing a fifth of grain..

7267864,3,B00YT9IWTE,A fun and entertaining take on the civil war.  Who knew of heroic acts of the Frankentein monster?  The movie was surprisingly enjoyable.,1442448000,,137,4.913043478260869

7267866,1,B00YT9IWTE,"There comes a time when a premise is just enough to get me to watch a movie. Here, we have Frankensteins monster running amok during the American Civil War. It sounds as if it would almost be a story told by Mike Mignola and featuring his creation Hellboy. Throw in a mad scientist, a reluctant time traveler and a Robin (as in Batmans sidekick) esque Igor and you have something no one has over conceived of before. Is this genre cocktail worth your while?

Army of Frankensteins suffers on multiple levels from acting to special effects. The story itself takes a great liberty with history, but then again so did Quentin Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds. However, in this case, one cant be so forgiving. Alan Jones (Jordan Farris) is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend when he is abducted, harvested for organs, and then inadvertently sent back to the Civil War. He arrives in 1864 (which is incredibly important) to discover that Frankensteins from the multiverse have arrived. Alan must help Igor (Christian Bellgardt), the very same person who did the aforementioned crimes against him, to set the time stream right. As it was in Back to the Future, Alan potentially could erase his own existence if Solomon Jones (Rett Terrell) doesnt marry the freed slave/ nurse, Virginia (Raychelle McDonald).

The army of Frankensteins creations all look exactly the same. This means that the multiverse really isn't as diverse as we would think. In reality, it is just a simple way to have one actor, Eric Gesecus, play the same monster over and over again on a digital stage. This is one of the many sore thumbs of the movie. It was obviously shot digitally for time and moneys sake, but it lacks any artistic flair, which is the complete opposite of the end title sequence. There are times when the film is perfectly well lit and looks as if it was shot in a field with a cell phone. This is in great contrast to the saccharine love scenes of the film in both the past and present.

Camera tricks and special effects really aren't the problem here. Neither are the store bought mustaches, beards, and brand new Civil War equipment. It is, after all, 1864 and everyone looks like they just rolled out their newest duds for the shoot. I doubt that there was even one real Civil War re-enactor in the whole movie. The main problem with Army of Frankensteins is the story. Alan and Igor are supposed to believably suddenly trust one another. Why? They both want to get home. We are given some of the love story between Solomon and Virginia, but Virginia throws herself at Alan in one scene and we have to ask, again, why? That scene really is the final nail in the coffin if you even made it that far into the film with any hope that it could get better. I pressed on only to find out that President Lincoln is off to Fords Theatre a year early (historically, it should be April 14th, 1865) and meets his death in a different way. Again, Quentin Tarantino has changed history, but here they jump the gun completely for no reason. We have monsters other than Frankensteins creation, steam punk weapons, even a balloon ride, and its just all so boring.

The concept here sounds fun, but every once of fun is sucked dry by all those involved save one, Christopher Robinson. Robinson, who plays John Wilks Booth, really does relish in his dark moment in history.",1442016000,,3357,4.62751677852349
7267867,4,B00YT9IWTE,"A near-perfect B movie.  The 2.8 star IMDB rating seems to come from disgruntled Southerners and the Indo-Malay archipelago, who have taken the movie quite seriously.  The green screens might be obvious, but the background cinematography is excellent.  We might have a new Evil Dead on our hands.",1442016000,4,296,5.125

It's filled with silly comedy, time travel, American History, the civil war, and Frankenstein monsters...lots of them! The gore is decent for such a low budget movie. The story revolves around Alan Jones, who thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him. He is attacked and gets his eye taken by Dr. Tanner and his boy assistant, Igor. The monster is brought to life, but a freak accident happens, and they are all taken back to 1865, the year of the Civil War. They must not only survive the Confederate side, but must deal with the Frankenstein army clone of monsters. If you love so bad-it's good style movies, and time traveling monsters, you'll love ARMY OF FRANKENSTEINS!!!",1441929600,4,1159,6.532467532467533
7267869,4,B00YT9IWTE,"Inspired by true events, an army of inter-dimensional Frankensteins, Alan Jones (Jordan Farris), a little boy named Igor (Christian Bellgardt) and not Bruce Campbell are transported back in time to the Civil War where they fight for the Union army against a Frankenstein created by the south. Solomon Jones loses his arm and has a plasma cannon sewn to it, because a chainsaw has already been done.

The film follows much of ""The Army of Darkness"" formula. It is campy and designed to be a cult film. Jordan Farris is not Bruce Campbell and this production falls a little short of the classical cult status, but will certainly give you the necessary cult fix until the next great one comes along. The film utilizes a catchy opening soundtrack. The present time era of the girlfriend in the supermarket wasn't written well.

7267871,4,B00YT9IWTE,"An instant cult classic, Donnald Taylor is the greatest Abe Lincoln i've seen on film oron or off stage. Lots of fun and camp. Buy it and a couple for friends then let`s start a fan club! Great jams and a good score. Action, adventure, monsters, sci/fi, ballons, and a subtle point plus lots more. Have a great tomorrow.",1441065600,2,320,4.440677966101695
7267872,4,B00YT9IWTE,"The film begins in Virginia, 1864. A squad of Confederate soldiers is on a routine patrol when one of them breaks rank to rendezvous with his lover.  Sadly, just as the soldier is about to commence his own Bull Run, the lovers are set upon by an army, not the Union Army, but an Army of Frankensteins!
 As is so often the case, an ego-maniacal mad scientist is at the heart of our troubles, in an attempt to reanimate the Monsters corpse, the crazy Dr. Finski accidentally tears open a hole in the space/time continuum, pouring a multiverse worth of Frankensteins into the middle of the American Civil War.  Correcting this little glitch in Time constitutes Our Heroes Quest.
I hate to give away too much in a review so Ill just give you a few highlights. This movie has a lot of good stuff in it, including nods to some of the classic Frankenstein films, (as well as Phil Hartmans version) some effective and often funny gross out effects, a plasma coil cannon, a Counter-Frankenstein, discussions on everything from time travel to the nature of true love, Igor played as a wise- cracking yet highly competent 12 year old boy, and Frankensteins attempt to thwart Lincolns assassination at Ford Theater.
  Not only is an entertaining film with a good sense of fun, but it seems it was also made by a small group of independent artists and therefore could use your financial support.  So spend your money on a product that is not only a good time, but that will help these folks turn out more quality entertainment.",1440979200,7,1514,4.609665427509293

8719112,1,B00YT9IWTE,"This is nothing but a pet project of some local TV guys in OKC, who think they have talent. What a waste of time and money. It looks cheap, terrible costumes and make-up, and no real acting, other than John Ferguson.

8719116,4,B00YT9IWTE,"After the initial revulsion wore off, I gave this film a try. Clearly cheap and strange,it has an off-the-wall feel to it, a b-movie scif mashup. Civil War plus 100 Frankenstein monsters? Forget about looking for great talent or high quality, and leave all your pretenses behind and dive into this pile of cheeze. It's worth the time for the mere spectacle. I hope they do more bizarro mashups like this!",1489017600,,404,4.704225352112676
8719117,3,B00YT9IWTE,A charming light romance that doesn't suffer from the presence of Julia Roberts or any other actress of the horse-faced variety. Mistaken assumptions and foolish reactions make for a farcical first two acts but then all problems are solved in time for the big tap dance party finale. A fine choice for you and your honey to spend a cozy evening with a bottle of Chardonnay and candles.,1484784000,,385,4.676470588235294

8719119,4,B00YT9IWTE,"Better than I expected. This is not a big budget polished movie, but is better than some of the Home movie style crap I have been offered on Amazon Prime.

Totally original. If you are like me and would rather take a chance on something new, than watch the same movie 10 times, then give this one a try. Just keep your expectations realistic for overall quality of a low budget film.",1483574400,,383,4.319444444444445
