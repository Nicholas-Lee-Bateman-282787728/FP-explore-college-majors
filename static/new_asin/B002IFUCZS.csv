3936079,3,B002IFUCZS,"I am an avid WWE fan but their movies have been lackluster. 12 Rounds was a huge step in the right direction but I was still skeptical of The Marine 2. Typically straight-to-dvd movies have a bad reputation. This movie looks to change that stigma. The action scenes are great and Ted Dibiase does the best job he possibly could. Dibiase has charisma and fits well in the role of a marine.

I felt the movie fell with a slow build-up of the story. You should feel a connection to the characters but this is a relatively short film (90 minutes). The first 35 minutes of the movie is the build-up. Once the hotel resort is overrun by the separatists, that's when the ""real"" action begins.

I would recommend this movie to those looking for a good ""B"" action film. The story is predictable, dialogue fair, and the action scenes are good. As for a letter grade, I would say B- for a straight-to-dvd film.",1263427200,,899,4.442424242424242
3936080,2,B002IFUCZS,"Ted D. plays the lead in this movie instead of John Cena and that was a mistake.  Ted didn't come off as being tough enough.  You know when you watch an action movie and you get that sense that the hero in the movie is going to kick butt and mess up the bad guys.  I never really got that feeling from Ted; he came off as a guy with an adorable smile.  He just didn't have that dangerous vibe that a one-man hero need's.  Even John Cena came off as being more tougher than him. Ted was playing a experinced Marine in this movie, but he came off as being a guy who just joined the marines rather than an experienced Marine.  He just wasn't believable as The Marine 2 and WWE could have casted this movie better.  It's an okay movie, but there are no highs.  It's just below average the whole movie.",1263168000,6,797,4.096774193548387
3936081,3,B002IFUCZS,"Joe Linwood (Ted Dibiase Jr.) is a Marine who decides to go on a vacation with his wife Robin (Lara Cox) to an exotic island resort that's owned by a client of hers as everything starts out nice before an attack happens at the grand opening party with all the guest taken everyone hostage including Joe's wife.  From there, Joe is determined to go in & get her but has to deal with the terrorist themselves along with other obstacles like politicians trying to not make this an international incident, a retired Army soldier who doesn't ""want to be a hero"", mercenaries who work for the highest price, and finding out throughout the movie that not everyone can be trusted.

As usual when it comes to sequels, they all get compared to the original as this movie is one of those type of sequels where it has absolutely no connection to the previous movie with the exception of it being a very similar plot so don't expect to see any reference to characters you saw in the first Marine movie.  The only thing this & the previous movie have in common is the story of a Marine being in the wrong place at the wrong time with his wife being taken hostage & with him going to save her but that's it besides that basis along with the involvement of certain elements that go into an action movie.  Dibiase does more ""acting"" as far as dialog than Cena did while his character & the entire environment was more ""realistic"" thanks to more dept & development as far as the story itself goes along with them learning from the first film & not trying to mix bad humor in with the movie. One of the big differences here was unlike how ""The Marine"" had a heavy amount of their action based off explosions, the action here was more diverse as you had a minor amount of explosions with more emphasis on gunfire & fighting using the Muay Thai style.

DVD extras include deleted & extended scenes along with a montage of various deleted shots. Various ""behind the scenes"" features, a look at Ted Dibiase, and various takes of the Muay Thai fights complete the extras.

In the end, I would say that this movie was more ""plot"" driven than action driven unlike how the first Marine & other WWE films have been.  I enjoyed other WWE films more than this one but it's still worth taking a look at so I suggest a rental & you decide from there.",1263168000,10,2318,4.401869158878505
3936082,1,B002IFUCZS,"This movie was an absolute train wreck. I wasn't expecting anything great seeing as it was movie starring a WWE star and it was straight to DVD, but I thought I'd get at least a decent action flick. I rented it off netflix and quickly learned I was wrong. Dibiase (along with everyone else in the movie) can't act to save their lives. It's not believable that Ted is a Marine (or a part of any armed forces for that matter). The plot was even weaker than the first. The action is mediocre at best. About halfway through the movie the disc skipped a bit and the audio went out of sync with the picture making it seem like a bad Godzilla movie. That was the most entertaining part of watching this abortion. Don't waste your time or money.",1263081600,4,737,4.309352517985611
3936083,4,B002IFUCZS,"As WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) tries to find it's latest star and face that can propel the company on the big screen, the company has had success with stars such as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, John Cena and Stone Cold Steve Austin but also a few that hardly registered on the radar.

The latest wrestler to go on the big screen is one of their newer wrestler's Ted DiBiase, Jr., son of Ted DiBiase (The Million Dollar Man).  With the film originally planned for WWE wrestler Randy Orton, due to a collarbone injury, DiBiase Jr. took on the role for  ""The Marine 2"" and is his first major theatrical debut.

""The Marine 2"" is directed by Roel Reine (""The Lost Tribe"", ""Adrenaline"") and features a screenplay by Christopher Borrelli (""Whisper"") and John Chapin Morgan.  Cinematography is by Joost Van Starrenburg (""Holy Water"", ""Bodega"", ""George and the Dragon"") and music composed by Trevor Morris (""Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2"", ""The Tudors"", ""Kings"").

The film receives a direct-to-video release (Blu-ray and DVD) and hoping to achieve the same results as the first film which made over $30 million in home sales and rental.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Marine 2"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and in widescreen (1:85:1) with AVC@33MBPS.  Let me just say that I was amazed about the cinematography of this film.  I really thought this would be a low budget affair and what we see in the film are beautiful overhead shots of the island and also some underwater cinematography as well.

There is nice detail from the beginning with Joe and his partner on the rooftop of the buildings and you can see the detail in the concrete and sweat dripping through his skin.  Skin tones are natural, pores can be seen and the film is absolutely vibrant with the shots of the island resort looking quite beautiful and also showcasing the Southeast Asian villages and the detail of the older homes seaside.  Overall, I was impressed by the cinematography by Joost Van Starrenburg and also director Roel Reine who did a lot of the film's camera work and ""The Marine 2' actually looks very good on Blu-ray.

As for the audio, lossless audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Also, in Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.

""The Marine 2' is an action-driven film.  Plenty of explosions, broken glass, crashing wood, vehicles, concrete breaking apart, you name it...this film has plenty of action and you hear it.

Dialogue is clean and understandable through the front and center channels,  front and surround channels showcase a lot of the special effects and LFE fans who love that bass, are going to love hearing their subwoofer put to work.

Overall, I was quite impressed with the picture and audio quality of this Blu-ray release.  I thought it was going to be a low-budget affair but very good cinematography and good use of audio through the action segments.

As for the subtitles, subtitles are presented in Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Wow! I have to admit that I literally came in with low expectations with this film because a)  Ted DiBiase Jr. is one of the newer and younger WWE Superstars who has played a villain since emerging in WWE  b) It's a WWE sequel to a film that starred John Cena and is direct-to-video and c) ""The Marine"" was not exactly a great film (although it did well in DVD sales and rental).

So, I came into this film not expecting much and after watching this Blu-ray release... Wow!  It was pretty good.  And I'll say it right now, it was much better than some of the WWE films that came out in theaters.  Really good cinematography (picture quality was solid on Blu-ray), good use of lossless audio showcasing the action throughout your home theater surround channels and nice LFE coming from the subwoofer(s).  And in addition to the Blu-ray's PQ and AQ, the release features a good number of special features.

I actually was impressed with DiBiase Jr.'s performance.  It helps that he's a newer wrestler because he has not suffered career threatening injuries just yet, he's very mobile, quick on his feet and not as rigid when it comes to the fight scenes.  I know this film was originally planned for Randy Orton before his injury but for his first acting role, DiBiase, Jr. did a wonderful job.

Overall, for a WWE film, I must admit that the film is one of the better WWE films that I've seen.  I was expecting for a low budget crapfest but ""The Marine 2"" was a pretty damn good action film and the Blu-ray release is pretty solid!

If you are a WWE or DiBiase fan or looking for a straight-up action popcorn flick, ""The Marine 2"" is worth checking out!",1262563200,4,6559,4.740282685512367
3936084,2,B002IFUCZS,"to me near the end the action was good but for me first 10 minutes and last 20 minutes wer good but about 45 minutes of the movie it was at night time and its horrible trying tow atch who's shooting who and such in the middle of the night, i thought part one's plot was easier to fallow, yet this plot is stuff that probaly goes on over seas but deep down i was disapointed . it had its moments but i was disapointed john cena's version was better to me as far fetched as that one was, to me it was still better than this one",1262304000,,525,3.8703703703703702
3936085,1,B002IFUCZS,"By the time the opening credits had finished rolling I had a pretty good idea that this movie would be a dissapointment. If you are incredibly naive and completely unfamiliar with combat tactics, incursion or recon manuevers, and plain common sense - - then you might find this movie entertaining. For most viewers this will be an insult to their intelligence. I'm no jarhead or ex-military but this director is a flat out idiot. Next time get some technical advisors for God's sake! Ten minutes of reviewing Internet clips from war torn areas of the world would give the lay person a better sense of combat realism than this director was able to muster up. What a bufoon! Don't waste your time watching this garbage.",1262131200,4,717,4.744
3936086,4,B002IFUCZS,"First off, I was disappointed that John Cena wasn't coming back for the sequel, and when I heard it was Ted DiBiase filling his shoes, I was extremely skeptical.  However, I decided to rent it and give it a chance.  Overall, I was suprised and impressed how well the movie turned out.  The action scenes are solid, and the story moves along at a nice pace.  DiBiase delivers as a marine and does a nice job as the hero.  Even if you're not a big fan of him as a wrestler, give him a chance in this movie.  I think most people will be suprised!",1262044800,12,543,4.123809523809523

3936099,1,B002IFUCZS,"I don't expect realism from an adventure movie but this was just a terrible performance. I loved Marine 1 but Marine 2 is poorly written and acted. The hero's lack of responsiveness in the midst of the initial terrorist attack is completely out of keeping with what an average Marine would have done. Much less a Force Recon Marine! The the acting is flat, the other characters are stereotypes and the dialogue is predictable and boring. I couldn't force myself to continue watching after the first 15 minutes. It was an insult to the USMC that I served in. Don't waste your time with this movie. I would rate it a solid Minus 10",1487808000,2,629,4.526315789473684

In 2, Ted DiBiase Jr plays the title Marine role, sniper Joe Linwood.  In this version, Joe and wife Robin, (Lara Cox) are on a vacation to a privately owned island in Southeast Asia.  The island is taken over by insurgents.  Remember the Tamal Tigers?  This is Hollyweird's version.

Linwood leaps into action bringing his favored weapon into play: the rifle.  Like the original, booms and bangs are heard throughout.  Don't go into this thinking you'll be seeing Cena back in the bayou.  No and no.  It's not Cena and it's not in the bayou.  DiBiase does a decent enough job to get the point across.

3936189,3,B002IFUCZS,"When people hear WWE films, or see that a wrestler is starring in a movie, they are automatically turned off, and I never understood why. We tend to see wrestlers as muscles heads, running around in their underwear, but the truth is that wrestling is fake. These guys are all actors who every week need to learn line and choreography, just like an actor does! When WWE films was launched in 2006, a lot of people snickered, but the truth is, we've gotten some pretty films from the company, including 12 Rounds, The Call, See No Evil, and The Marine. Much like other Action films, the plot of the Marine 2 is somewhat thin. The story features a highly decorated, U.S. Marine, on vacation with his wife, when the resort is overrun by terrorists. The Marine (Ted DiBiase Jr.), has to take it upon himself to save his wife and the other hostages, when it becomes painfully obvious that the local military isn't equipped to deal with the terrorists. DiBiase Jr., a third generation wrestler, is the star of this film, an unlike John Cena in the first film, DiBiase really seems to have some type of military training in his background. The action and fight sequences are much better in this film then they were in the first. DiBiase Jr. really seems to know what he's doing and it made the story that much more enjoyable. What DiBiase Jr. lacks in acting skills, is more than made up for with the terrific action sequences. He is also aided by some fairly big names for a film like this, including Michael Rooker of The Walking Dead and Star Wars, Temuera Morrison. The first Marine film was a debut for a studio and lacked the bite of most Action films. The second installment was much better, featuring a more experienced cast, and much better fight sequences. You may not want to see this film, because it's a WWE production, and I can respect that, but in all honesty, you'll be missing out on a more than decent Action movie.",1379116800,,1926,4.537356321839081

And it's up to Ted Jr. & The Walking Dead's Mural to save the day. Not as good as the Original with John Cena but it is more darker and serious.,1369699200,,276,3.8596491228070176
3936194,4,B002IFUCZS,I enjoyed the action and plot much more than the third Marine. He was much more believable and even likeable.,1368403200,,109,4.5
3936195,4,B002IFUCZS,"WWE has produced another off-shoot of The Marine franchise, which is pretty close in action to first movie (The Marine) starring John Cena.  Not bad, not bad at all.",1367625600,,165,4.689655172413793
3936196,3,B002IFUCZS,WWE know the formula for action movies and this is another example.  There are no surprises or shocking plot twists but plenty of action and pretty scenery.,1366848000,,156,4.777777777777778

3936209,5,B002IFUCZS,It's a really cool movie almost as good as the first movie when John cena and the action is good and has a hint of humor,1363219200,,120,3.6538461538461537
3936210,4,B002IFUCZS,I LIKED THE MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE WRESTLER AND THE PLOT.  VERY ACTION PACT AND ENJOYED WOULD OWN IT. AWESOME,1363219200,,107,4.35

3936212,3,B002IFUCZS,Its hard to believe but John Cena was a better actor.  As a retired Marine I marvel sometimes how Marines are portrayed as the muscle bound killing machine with little personality and the drop dead gorgeous wife.  The plot was as obvious as the location was beautiful.,1360108800,,268,4.680851063829787

3936216,5,B002IFUCZS,"M2 is an enjoyable, action-packed, suspenseful movie with exciting scenes and vibrant cinematography (the shots of the island resort were wish-I-was-there breath-taking). It does deserve its R-rating as the violence to and from the terrorists can be brutal at times.

What I liked most is Ted's acting allows you to truly sympathize with Joe (Ted Dibiase) and how he'd do anything to get his wife back. Joe (Ted) is not an over-the-top, emotional, screaming-maniac Marine hero; he keeps his cool, which is quite refreshing.

I hope WWE does more of these action movies, and I look forward to seeing Ted in more of them.  M2 went straight to video; yet, it was much better than some of the WWE films that came out in theaters.

M2 is a good addition to your movie library. Will be watching this movie again.",1301616000,,806,4.735714285714286
3936217,5,B002IFUCZS,"We all know that Cena is not in this movie. I was angry when I first heard it but I can say I was very impressed with the new casting of Ted. He did an amazing job and I look forward to him starring in more movies. I thought the plot was predictable but it didn't matter. The cast was realistic and the action was nonstop and not overboard.

The bluray itself looked amazing with vivid colors and amazing detail. Also the sound effects and sound track gave my sound system a run for its money. I was amazed of how well the bluray turned out compared to many other movies.

I was really impressed by the overall effects and casting. It was done much better than I would have guessed!!!! You can't go wrong with this.....

This is a must own for this genre......",1293840000,5,760,4.227586206896552
3936218,3,B002IFUCZS,"Military type movie. Better then  average, but missing some real punch.  All muscle little brains. Could have been better.  Better then the first one.",1279152000,,150,5.166666666666667
3936219,5,B002IFUCZS,"Good movie with plenty of action. However, the movie was just not the same without John Cena, the original actor from the first ""The Marine"". Worth buying and worth adding to your movie library. Enjoy!",1271376000,2,201,4.771428571428571
3936220,4,B002IFUCZS,"I just finished watching The Marine 2 and i have to say that the sequel is alot better than the first one starring John Cena. For example, He plays the role very honestly, sort of how Bruce Willis Played John Mcclain in the Die Hard movies. You Think Ted's character doesn't stand a chance but somehow he makes things happen. Also another surprise was his acting. There's a moment where you forget he's a wrestler. It's really nice to see someone actually have real chemistry with their co-stars. The  action is top notch, although i would of preferred not seeing wrestling moves, witch aren't many, maybe like three moves but still. I know the WWE is behind these films but i don't understand why they always have to incorporate wrestling into all their films. Anyways, overall, this movie is worth watching. People need to stop being so close minded and give this movie a chance. And the WWE needs t ostart paying attention to Ted DiBiase because he has the potential to be a huge success in his own right, weather it be in the wrestling ring or in films. He could easily be the next Dwayne Johnson, if given the opportunity.",1269648000,4,1127,4.579207920792079
3936221,3,B002IFUCZS,"I saw lots of action but some really stupid moves by  Ted DiBiase (Marine number 2). I know believability is not something you should look too deep for in a full action movie but the story and characters never seemed to flow right.  Also this movie lacked persons you could identify with and had some level of likeability. The movie was not bad, just a let down from Marine 1. I should mention the killing of the young boy never seemed to add anything to the movie. The sniper shot was really amateur, and while he had a spotter they were out in the open and at close range, and how did they get away?  When I worked at MDC we made ""RLG's"" and none had cute little fire balls that did little damage. Oh well, buy popcorn and sit and watch.",1268956800,,739,4.190140845070423
3936222,5,B002IFUCZS,"The marine 2 was an excellent movie to watch.  I purchased this movie through amazon.com at an incredibly low price as a used video, recieved the movie a few days later, and was very surprised to find that everything about the movie was of a brand new quality.  Amazon.com has been my personal source for movie purchasing for quite some time now, and you can believe that I always share this information with my family and friends.  Thank you amazon.com!",1268697600,,454,4.65
3936223,4,B002IFUCZS,"This WWE movie was good.  It wasn't as good as Marine with John Cena.  But if you want to see a fast paced action movie that doesn't tax your brain with a complicated plot, this is the movie.  There were a few action sequences that just didn't make any sense.  But I won't spoil the movie and will leave it up to the viewer to make their own opinion.  But overall, it made for a good Saturday night movie and we will watch it again.",1268352000,,432,4.035294117647059
3936224,2,B002IFUCZS,"DiBiase is a very good charismatic wrestler. As an actor, I would say that he can compare with any carboard figure in the world and come out losing. And he doesn't know how to fight. In fact, any ten year-old karate student from the school across the street can not only teach him a lot but also beat the crap out of him. Why didn't they let him wrestle the bad guys rather than throwing girl scout punches?

  In this movie he has to fight some Thai experts who beat him in a most disgusting way and, at the end, had him win. It's ludicrous.

  Among other annoying flaws of this movie: anybody acts decently and does a good job, except DiBiase, the hero. What a downer! Where were you, Tom Cena?

  I give this flick 2 stars, just because all other actors were superb, compared to DiBiase. Oh, and he has a few tender moments with his movie wife (beautiful actress Lara Cox) and looks awkward and out of place and is as romantic as a pine cone.",1267920000,3,946,4.240223463687151

Well.... this movie was not as good as I hoped it would be I give it a 2 1/2 star-- for it was ok.  The scenery was good, the movie had action in it but I thought the plot could have been a bit better, and the movie not so slow-going in spots.  The casting was good-- I liked Ted D. in the movie, and I really liked the charter boat guide.",1263600000,,496,3.7403846153846154
