3911919,5,B002DMJM5M,"I found this collection for a very reasonable price (at
Sams Club actually).  What can I say - if you have a toddler
you are likely familiar with most of the shows featured on
these discs.  This is a no-frills collection of at least 4.5
to 5 hours of hit programs featuring Dora, Diego, Wonder Pets,
Kai Lan and the quirky but fun Yo Gabba Gabba.  For my daughter
at least, its what the doctor ordered.",1260748800,17,402,4.2631578947368425

3911927,5,B002DMJM5M,A friend of mine was moving to another city and was not going to be able to have cable set up right away. She had an 8 month daughter and I just knew that would not work with all of the moving and no TV to keep her entertained. After doing some searching I found this 3 DVD set with 444 minutes of shows and thought this could keep her preoccupied. My friend commented afterwards she doesn't know how they would have survived without it. All of her favorite shows-I couldn't ask for more. Best 25 bucks spent if your child watches Nick Jr. and your in a position you can't access the channel.,1298937600,5,592,4.201754385964913

8365526,5,B002DMJM5M,"My kids love the modge podge of all their favorite shows.  I think the sports day and celebrate family discs are a bit corny and could have been geared towards something a bit different, but my kids could care less.
