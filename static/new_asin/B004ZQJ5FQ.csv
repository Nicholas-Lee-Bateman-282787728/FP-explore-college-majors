4510565,4,B004ZQJ5FQ,This is a great Shaun the Sheep DVD as it contains seven episodes full of mischievous fun!  If you have never seen Shaun the Sheep before it is claymation which I like because it is a break from the regular animated cartoons we watch all day long.  This DVD is also something the whole family can enjoy and appreciate.  My boys love the characters and how they get into trouble and my husband and I appreciate the simpleness yet funny story lines!  It is also nice because the characters don't talk (they do make sounds though) so there is no singing or words to pay attention to.  I pop this DVD in and my boys watch it and ask for me over and over!  The sheep all think they are sneaky and can get away with everything but they do make mistakes and work together!,1312070400,6,765,4.241379310344827

4510577,5,B004ZQJ5FQ,"OH.My. Gosh - these are an absolute hoot. You hear about ""good for all ages"" - well these REALLY are - from toddlers (nonverbal) to the oldest of the old - really a hoot. Claymation, from the Aran sweater designs to the sheep who drop poop when scared - just a riot. Better for kids than the punch-em-shoot-em-up or dainty-girly pablum offered for kids these days. Just an absolute delight.",1427500800,2,390,4.585714285714285

4510604,5,B004ZQJ5FQ,"This is one of, if not The funniest, warmest and most clever claymation I know of.  I just roll with laughter but the parody and subtle character elements are there making this series multi layered so when the kids want to watch something it works but when I need to let go of living in a city that never sleeps or says its sorry or runs its trains and buses on time Shaun and Bitzer , Shirley and the gang leave me laughing till I cry and feeling like its all alright...

8450333,5,B004ZQJ5FQ,"It's Shaun the Sheep!  Need I say more?  These movies appeal to everyone: hubby originally got me hooked one grumpy day early on in our marriage.  Once we had kids, we bought a couple videos to share with them; they loved them from the get-go.  My kids watched them at my mom's house recently, and she told me that she recommended them to my brother because she thinks they are so cleverly done.  These seven-minute episodes feature sheep protagonists and no actual spoken language (just animal sounds and grunts), but the comedy value can't be beat.",1498780800,,550,4.6875
