I was fond of most of the shorts present.  The Crystal Crayon short was both beautiful, action-packed, and sad.  I found it dragged just a bit towards the end but it was the perfect mixture of shonen styled anime with a surprisingly futuristic twist.  The second oneDoorbellmade me question what exactly I was watching.  Im still not certain how it ended... but I guess it was probably a Yokai.  The animation and everything was enjoyable enough.  The third one was the short I had the most problems with.  It was filled with occult imagery, which I would normally eat up with a spoon, but made no coherent philosophical or logical sense.  It was a riot of colors but attempting to understand the hidden side to the story appeared to be a fruitless endeavor.  Towards the end I was convinced that I was watching an attempt at Neuro-Linguistic Programming or some kind of Chaos Magick-inspired spell done by the Archer animators.  Happy Machine, on the other hand, started as what appeared to be a discussion on the world we have today and instead was an adventure story of a cyclic nature.  I appreciated it the most of all of the shorts, but it HAS to be watched to even begin to be discussed, and any discussion beforehand would spoil it.  And the last piecerelatively normal compared to the rest of the pieces involvedwas the sweetest and saddest of all.  A love story between a boy and a girl.  In a way its the perfect cap for the piece as a whole, because I left weepy.

Would I recommend it?  If you like anthologies, yes.  If you like anime, yes.  Its a sparkling, amazingly animated kaleidoscope of imagery and inspiration.  If you're unfamiliar with the mixed bag of feelings and emotions you can derive from both, then I would skip it.  Otherwise, this author truly believes that most interested in the genre would get something out of it.",1451433600,,2109,4.622641509433962
8357971,5,B0029MAYCQ,"This is a very worthy DVD and anyone who is interested in Anim and animation in general should have a look at it. A range of animation styles are presented and it contains some of the most interesting animation I've yet seen from Japan. You will be delighted with the work on display here.

However, I would like to urge viewers to go to the interviews with the directors before watching each short animation, I found their comments very stimulating and informative. Knowing the ""hows and whys"" of an artwork doesn't spoil the impact for me. However, if you like to experience a work of art without any preconceptions, then just play the works and watch the interviews later.",1247702400,6,675,4.6722689075630255
