5671090,1,B00BT6VSUA,"Zaytoven (Xavier Dotson) is a musician whose music we really never get to hear but a few notes. The film takes place in Atlanta which the opening scene makes very clear. Zaytoven plays for his church on Sunday and cuts hair during the week, waiting for his big break. His cousin Nuke(Curtis Franklin) comes to town from Chicago or Detroit with a pocket full of money. He convinces Zaytoven that he should be his manager. Nuke uses his thug connections to try to get Zaytoven ahead while Zaytoven ignores legitimate offers.

The film was fairly boring. The one scene where a guy is getting beat up was done poorly as you can tell he wasn't getting struck by the feign blows. The language was mostly hip-hop slang, which means I caught every other word. The film appears to be made by a bunch of hip-hop artists that think they can act. I wouldn't give 50 Cents for the lot of them.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word. No sex or nudity.",1373155200,5,931,4.502958579881657
5671091,5,B00BT6VSUA,"Brick Squad affiliate Zaytoven has been shutting it down in the studio with his sick beats for years,  but he really shows another side of him in Birds of a Feather. Zaytoven debuts his acting talent which displays how versatile an entertainer he can be. The movie takes an unfiltered look at the struggles two brothers faced trying to make a name for themselves in the rap game.  Birds of a Feather  is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what just happened and hoping that everything works out for the duo, till the very end. This movie is only enhanced by the appearance of Brick Squad founder Gucci Mane and an ensemble cast of rappers including Shawty Shawty and OJ da Jucieman.",1372118400,2,699,4.488188976377953

She told me the part about how he played the piano in church was good. She even liked the part when he got into hip hop and overcame his obstacles.  How can I not give this movie 5 STARS.....

There are people who are going to watch it and say it some Hollywood bulls@!#, and those are the same people who think conspiracies are just theories.

I highly recommend Birds of a Feather to anyone thinking about getting into the music business, and the rap genre specifically.
