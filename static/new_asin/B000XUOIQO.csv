3008566,5,B000XUOIQO,This DVD received a terrible review before it even came out.  Disney usually does a great job with their straight to DVD movies.  Give it a chance before you rate it.,1210464000,15,166,4.32258064516129

3008569,2,B000XUOIQO,"As a lifelong Disney fan, of all the sequels and (Midquels??  not a word but I needed something to describe The Lion King 1 1/2 as my example)...Ariel's Beginning is really unnecessary because it add nothing NEW to the cannon of the story. You're not telling things from a minor character or villain's POV here; just tying up loose ends that weren't ENDS or LOOSE. In the Original, you have an overprotective merman king that raising 7 daughters ALONE, flees  for safety when ships sail above, and sees humans as DANGEROUS Enemies??? Not a big leap to conclude that humans led to Triton becoming a widower in the first place. This story could had been condensed down, re-cut with the original as sold as a ""deluxe edition"". Spoiler: Atlantica's ban on music (in this film) could have been told in a family history flashback in the sequel.",1484784000,,838,4.6938775510204085
3008570,5,B000XUOIQO,I bought this movie because I loved the other Little Mermaid movies as a child so I knew it would be nostalgic for me. I don't regret it. It's an amazing movie and I'll always love it. I'm so heavily satisfied and recommend this to everyone.,1484697600,,241,4.260869565217392
3008571,2,B000XUOIQO,"I was debating between one or two starts. I would not recommend buying this movie. Honestly i feel this one is a waste of money. The story line is silly. Spoiler alert : I find it incredible silly when Ariel's mother went back to save her music box given by king Triton, when her whole family, including her husband was safe already from the pirates and waiting for her.  She chose to save a sentimental musical gift given by king Triton instead of actually being with him and her daughters. Really?  The nanny's facial features looks a lot like Ursula. I was bored after 10 min of this movie, and my two year old daughter was more entertained by playing with her dinner than watching this movie.",1484006400,,696,4.47244094488189

3008577,5,B000XUOIQO,"I love this movie!!!  Once upon a time I owned every Disney VHS there was, and then, well, VHS was a thing of the past (can you imagine!!!?) and my final ability to play my beloved movies broke for the umpteenth time and I just couldn't justify fixing it again. I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who has seen The Little Mermaid (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a wonderful movie that answers many of the back-story questions you may never have had. My kids (and I!!!) enjoyed it immensely!

Amazon Digital is wonderful--it's nice to have this movie there in my forever library so I can watch it whenever and wherever I wish. The process was simple--press buy and viola! It showed up in my library.",1472947200,2,840,4.4480519480519485

3008579,2,B000XUOIQO,"The story is cute but if you're a fan of the original Little Mermaid movie you're going to be disappointed with this one. The music in the original is just classic but this one has very little original music. And the original music in it is not very good. Maybe it's just me but it feels like they didn't even try with this movie. My daughter loves the characters and she likes this movie but she doesn't love it and I feel the same way that she does.

We didn't hate it but we didn't love it and we just almost like it. Knowing then what I know now I would not have purchased this movie.

3008581,2,B000XUOIQO,"This film left much to be desired. Ursulas backstory was not included, and Queen Athena looks too much like Ariel. Some fans of TLM have created better designs for Queen Athena (images attached). Also, most of the music is unoriginal. On the positive side, the animation is beautiful and Ariels sisters get more screen time.

3008604,5,B000XUOIQO,"If you compare this film to The Little Mermaid, it's almost the polar opposite. The Little Mermaid had very thin characters, sketchy animation, a thin plot, a very high budget, and outstanding music with award-winning songs. On the other hand, this film has gorgeous animation that is very solid looking, very well-developed characters, a plot that's a bit of stretch but more developed, a lower budget, and songs that are almost an after-thought. I still like it better.

I've always thought the world of The Little Mermaid was an interesting one, and the music is enchanting. That said, I've always hated the sea witch, and found the romance awkward and the actual portrayal of the world to be very, very, thin. After re-watching The Little Mermaid much older than my first viewings in the theater, I kept wondering about Ariel's sisters, what life was supposed to actually be like in the kingdom, why her father was such a grouch, how she got to be friends with Flounder, etc, etc. This film nicely fills in all the details.

The aspect of the film I like the very most is that each of Ariel's sisters actually has a personality and interaction with each other, unlike the placeholders that were her sisters in the Feature Film. I was also quite glad to ditch the annoying comic relief of the seagull and instead have every character exist to tell the story rather than to be purely goofball distraction. There's no epic stakes in this film, no horrific battle between good and evil or whatever, but then again, I never liked that in the first film.

Instead there's a simple Footloose-style story about a kingdom where music is outlawed, a jealous social-climber, and a very sincerely, beautiful,and musically gifted protagonist. As opposed to the headstrong over-emotionalism of Ariel in The Little Mermaid, she a much more balanced person here, and a lot more likable. Likewise, while her father is a bit of an overbearing tyrant, at least he isn't a clueless menacing authority figure who seems to exist only to yell at his kids and terrify his subjects like in the TLM.

Yeah, there's no oscar-worthy songs to be had here, but there is a nice little Aria for Ariel to sing (Jodie Benson, you are one of my heroes), and plenty of style of music that was EVERYWHERE after The Little Mermaid came out (come on, you guys claim to be Little Mermaid fans and don't remember the MASSIVE wave of coverage that Sebastian's steel-drum fueled island rhythms sent around the world?). Yeah, the villain can't sing, and more full-blown musical numbers in the style of the first-film would have been great, but the songs here are far fro terrible. I'd say they are about on the level of the excellent Lion King sequels.

If you have an open mind and a thirst for traditional animation assisted by computers, this film is light and fluffy, and gorgeous to behold. And yeah, I can't get enough of Jodie Benson as Ariel either. I don't own The Little Mermaid, but I own this film. It's very enjoyable, even though the plot does jump around a bit and is on the silly/flimsy side. It's more than made up for by the great characters and animation. Five stars.",1450137600,7,3146,4.712727272727273

3008646,3,B000XUOIQO,"Continuing the Disney tradition of killing one or both parents, in this installment we almost get to see Ariel's mother bashed by a pirate ship.  Apparently, that was enough for the distraught King Triton to banish music from his kingdom......FOREVER!  Yeah, that didn't make any sense to me either but there it is.  The tyrant forbids everyone from listening to and/or participating in song.  They can't even hum a mournful tune.  Not a ditty to be had anywhere.  So sad.  And incomprehensibly stupid, what is this a fascist state under the sea!?  Well, at least they weren't burning books.  Meanwhile, there's this EVIL governess (voiced by Sally Field) who rides roughshod over the seven sad mopey daughters of King Triton.  They spend their time primping and whining while the EVIL governess plots to overthrow Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright) so she can become second only to the sad and dictatorial King.  And!  Once again, the angry despot wields his trident and ruins everyone's fun.  Characters are thrown in a dungeon.  There's a prison break.  A double homicide is mentioned and attempted.  It's all quite jolly.  The songs, if you can call them that, are entirely forgettable and fortunately few in number.  They do perform a version of Jump in the Line (Shake, Shake, Shake, Senora) that feels oddly out of place, but in this case seems par for the course.  At least it's not quite as objectionable as the second cartoon in this series (known as the BIG mistake).  This one at least makes for passable entertainment.  I'd watch it again.",1419811200,,1556,4.862595419847328

3008685,2,B000XUOIQO,"I didn't even know until recently that there was a third Little Mermaid movie, and being the huge fan I am of the original film, I just had to watch this.  I'm sad to say I was really disappointed.

The story is very predictable and hardly original.  The music is forgettable.  And ""Shake Shake Senora""?  Seriously?  The villain and her sidekick are just horrible and annoying, they can't even hold a candle to Ursula, heck, even Morgana.  And Flounder is completely out of character.
The animation on the other hand is pretty nicely done for a direct-to-dvd release.  Nothing compared to the hand-drawn, hand-painted original movie, but good.  Getting to see more of Ariel's sisters was my favorite part.

Overall, I'm sure kids will like this movie, but older fans?  Probably not.  I'm not a huge fan of the Little Mermaid II, but even that sequel is much better than this.  I hate leaving negative reviews, but honestly, I found this movie forgettable and boring.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either.",1407628800,,1014,4.786127167630058

I did like the movie, but I did expect much more. It was only an hour and 17 minutes long. I don't really like it when movies use both animation with cartoon, it clashes.

It wasn't like a little mermaid movie. Ariel only sang once and the song wasn't much. There wasn't much to the story either. Yes, it was a good movie, but I was disappointed.",1365465600,,461,4.168539325842697

The songs in this movie by no means compare to the original The Little Mermaid, but they are still catchy at times.
The plot is expected, but fun: making it a great movie for any kid.
Some of the voice actors are lacking in their original skillfulness, but that is to be expected with a prequel/sequel that is developed several years later.

Overall, a typical, yet wonderful movie for young audiences.",1364428800,,499,4.735632183908046

I have not seen this movie but I have heard plenty enough. It's a disgrace to The Little Mermaid francise, especially the really good television series! The way Ariel and Flounder met in the series when they were cute kids was so good, yet they substitute it in a movie of absolutely nothing. The only thing I can compliment is the animation looking much more modern than the other direct to video films. But that doesn't change the bad choices they made for this story. King Triton is at his worst; he's a total jerk! There's the fact that they've put King Triton and Ariel through another major conflict when they've already had enough in the original movie, there's the fact that bringing music to Atlantica has no point to the original film, it's-I-er-IT'S SO TERRIBLE!!!!",1351209600,2,905,4.69811320754717

3008880,3,B000XUOIQO,"When you watch this movie, you will release something is terribly wrong. Well, not right from the start.

This movie opens with a wonderful scene featuring Ariel's mother, a younger King Trident (with a brown beard!), and all of their young children hanging out on rocks on the surface. Since we all know what happened to Ariel's mother, we know something sad is about to happen. This takes over about the first seven minutes of the film.

Being a prequel, this is before 1. King Trident is noticeably far more angry and withdrawn, so much that he doesn't want to hear any music. His time spent with his daughters consists of a short walk in the morning. This gives the movie an interesting tone.

But what happens next goes downhill. We get introduced to the girl's caretaker, ""Marina Del Rey,"" and ""Benjamin."" To start, Benjamin is so lazily animated that he doesn't even fit in the rest of the movie, which is above normal quality for direct-to-dvd Disney films. ""Marina Del Rey"" is a very typical female villian; all about the glamour, ready to decieve and steal, etc. In fact, all she really is comes off to be the poor man's (or women's) Ursula, who was very unique and down-right great. In fact, Morgana from Little Mermaid II was a thousands times better.

The movie moves into more trouble. Does anyone remember little Flounder, scared and terrified of everything? Apparently in this so-called ""prequel,"" he dances to music and acts obnoxious. Um, what? This makes no sense.
Not a whole lot happens at this point-they do some traveling, being a club dancing to ""Shake Senora""(can't even come up with an original song), and have more trouble with the evil Marina Del Rey. Her song on her own pails terribly to anything done by Ursula or Morgana. In fact, it's terrible.

So the ""big conclusion"" has ""Marina Del Rey"" unleashing electric eels on the characters, and them ultimately winning, with Marina and Benjamin being put in jail. Right there, it is so obvious that the movie had a chance to be far more than it was. With a female character who uses magic, uses electric eels as weapons, doesn't she seem to have some connection to Ursula? Why not turn her into a pre-Ursula, have her be cursed to be an octopus, or change, or anything? It is ultimately the uninspired, boring villian that brings down the movie from it's little mistakes.

This movie is far from terrible. The beginning is actually very good. However, if you are looking for a good sequel to the original Little Mermaid, the 2nd one with her daughter and Morgana was far better, darker, more detailed, and never ""out-of-character.""

Overall the high ratings of this movie are not deserved, though it is better than many Disney direct-to-dvd sequels.",1313884800,3,2726,4.750528541226216
3008881,4,B000XUOIQO,"Direct-to-video Disney spin-offs can be pretty hit-or-miss - ""The Little Mermaid II,"" for example, was an atrocity that I would not recommend to the most undistinguishing, mermaid-obsessed four-year-old; ""Ariel's Beginning,"" on the other hand, is a much much much better attempt at re-creating the atmosphere of the original movie.

Overall, it's not as good as the original - there are some silly bits, for example, a character death in the beginning.  The character is crushed to death against some rocks (completely offscreen and implied, there's nothing graphic about it at all) by a ship, which was apparently being sailed by ridiculously incompetent crewmen...despite the lovely sunny weather, they did not notice either the huge rock formations or the thirty mermaids who were lounging around on them.  -_-

There also wasn't much depth to the plot or script, but they weren't bad, either.  The voice acting was excellent, and the animation in particular was very beautiful, on par with the original film; that's actually what I liked the most.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you have young kids to entertain or are a die-hard Disney fan, but if you do fall into one or both of those categories, this is definitely a movie to pick up.",1312675200,,1244,5.04390243902439

3008885,1,B000XUOIQO,"Another direct to DVD sequel/prequel from Disney. Bland color palette and lack luster animation are the foundation of this latest installment to the little mermaid series.

The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.

Seriously, they have ""Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)"" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.

3008901,4,B000XUOIQO,"Even though as a grown up man, I still have the disney fever in me, I ended up purchasing this DVD. I've been in love with the Little Mermaid ever since I saw it and still am. However, this is NOT a sequel to Little Mermaid 2 as I thought it was advertised as but rather a prequel to the first movie. As I am not going to spoil about the story I am simply going to tell that it gave us more about Ariels family that we never saw in the first two movies. In this movie for the first time we got to see Ariels sisters as well as her mother ""Athena"" who we never knew off and why she wasn't in Ariels life in the first movie.
The story is good and has some heart to it, but not enough to movie you as the first one did. We also get to see a side of Ariels father King Triton that we never saw. The movie had heart in it but most of the time its all fun and games. Which leads me to my second point. Since its a prequel to the first movie, it goes somewhat against the television series of Little Mermaid that we used to see in the early 90's and has changed some of the story. It gives a completely different spin off of what we saw in the series. My Final point is that it would have been better as a series not a movie. The story doesn't exactly fit the requirements that makes it a movie to watch but rather if it was on the Television series then that would have made more sense. Like I said earlier, the story wasn't good enough for a movie but for a series. Disney shouldn't have made this as a movie and should have brought in something that should have been good rather than making a rather pointless third movie. As a fan of the Little Mermaid I was expecting more however it didn't beat my expectations at all.
Now that I've mentioned the bad, the reason why I would give it a four star is because when you have all three movies, and you wanted to show the little mermaid like my 5 and 8 year old cousins or even children, then this version is the one they would enjoy more. The animation is way better than we've seen in a ling time , you can clearly tell that animation has significantly improved. While the first movie was awesome but with todays kids, love stories aren't something they would watch and love the movie, rather they would enjoy this movie better. It brings little children to watch and the little ones would want to watch this over and over again and, its not something a family can't watch. Rather I would recommend this as something families can sit and watch together. The story is good enough to prevent people from forwarding the movie as well. And its good to see Ariel again and who doesn't!!
Its a good family movie to watch with kids that what I would tell you.",1296518400,,2696,4.107954545454546

3008903,1,B000XUOIQO,"This movie was disappointing.  My 4 year old LOVES Ariel and begged me for the DVD, so I put it on her Amazon wish list after reading positive reviews and glancing through the negative reviews.  I didn't have a problem with the fact that Ariel's mother dies in this prequel(we already know she is not in the original movie).  It was just set up and shown horribly in the first few minutes of the movie, and after that my daughter was in tears anytime a slightly scary part would occur, so I finally resulted to covering her eyes during the last and longest ""scary"" scene.  The main ""bad person"" (the purple hair character scowling on the DVD front) and especially her manatee sidekick were completely pointless, and therefore just annoying anytime they were on screen.  Her pet eels were too scary looking for a rated G movie (much worse than the eels or the shark in the original).  She also calls her sidekick an ""idiot,"" and sings a couple of terrible songs.

My daughter and I loved the beginning 2 minutes or so of the movie, showing Ariel as a preschool age child, as well as showing how much her parent's loved each other.  It's too bad the movie didn't spend more time on this part of Ariel's life.  Another positive are the interactions between Ariel and her sisters.  The last few minutes were good, showing how music and co(he walor returned to the kingdom.  Sebastian was true to character; Flounder was not.  The king was also too dark of a character for most of the movie (unbelievably so).  King Triton's banning of music, as well as his pair of swordfish guards would have provided enough scary and suspenseful scenes without the addition of the intended ""bad"" characters.  This one will be consigned, and we'll try the other Ariel movie on Netflix first before putting it on her wish list.",1294704000,3,1806,4.603125

3008906,3,B000XUOIQO,"The Animation is gorgeous!!!!!!!
But I hate the story line! The film does not introduce Ariel's life properly, It does not include the ""main"" concepts of the story of Ariel's life as a child. However, in the film we do see Ariel's mother for the first time,(who looks just like Ariel) and how she died, but that is it!!!
then the plot starts out as music being forbidden from Atlantica ""forever"", *YAWN*
The film is mostly centered around music, which if you ask me; is really lame!
The animated Series provided more information than this film did, and in the series Ariel met Flounder when she was very young, not when she was 15!
I only wish this film included the ""Key Concepts"" of the beloved story, such as...
How Ariel became infatuated with the human world
and How Ursula Was banished from Atlantica.
WHERE'S THAT?! WELL, IT'S NOT IN THIS MOVIE!!!!!!  if I ever work for Disney Animation, I will make a better version of the ""REAL"" story of Ariel's life!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1279065600,,973,4.656976744186046

3008918,2,B000XUOIQO,"The Little Mermaid and the sequel were made years ago, so why did they just decide to do another one out of the blue?  It is just not that great either.  It doesn't stick to the first two at all.  I think Disney could have given us a great back story on the original characters but blew their chance.  This plot was stupid, the music was awful, and I think Disney should have left well enough alone and not made this.  If you are a purist and want sequels to stick to the original closely, don't get this.",1271548800,2,505,4.112244897959184
3008919,5,B000XUOIQO,"After recently seeing the original film and its rushed-looking, mediocre-written sequel, I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.

I was blown away - this is one of the best Disney Direct-to-Video sequel/prequels I've ever seen!

The story starts with Ariel's childhood, and the sad death of her mother which drove King Triton into emotional trauma, unable to deal with his daughters as they grew up, banning music from Atlantica because the reminders of his wife were too painful. The story then jumps ahead to Ariel at 14 years old (two years before the original movie), and the now-silently miserable kingdom of Atlantica, with sharks working as anti-music security guards, arresting anyone who so much as dares to whistle.

The daughters of Triton are being mostly raised by their nasty governess Marina Del Rey, who covets Sebastian's position in the Royal Court, and is looking for any opportunity to seize it from him. She is helped by a soft-spoken and kind-hearted narwhal (I think he's a narwhal) named Benjamin.

While being punished for breaking the rules, Ariel meets a fish named Flounder, and later at night follows him to an underground club where inhabitants of Atlantica play music and dance until all hours - including a performance by Sebastian of Harry Belafonte's ""Jump in the Line"" (which some moviegoers will remember from ""Beetlejuice""), which is so lively that you can't help wanting to sing and dance along!

But secrets have a way of being exposed, leading to a quest by Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian to find a special item that once belonged to her mother, in hopes of bringing change to Atlantica.

The animation is well done, shaded with depth in a similar style to the first movie, and makes this a worthy entry in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" saga. (By comparison, the animation in LM2 is well drawn, but the rest of it is poorly colored and looks rushed).  I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it surpassed my expectations! Well worth buying!",1269993600,,1995,4.884615384615385
3008920,2,B000XUOIQO,"After watching Little Mermaid 2, I was quite excited for this sequel.  The story line is a bit depressing.  Not only does her mother die (this is Disney afterall) but then the whole story is about how her father is a real downer afterwards.  There's not enough time and too many sisters to really get a good handle on who is who.  The music is good.  If my daughter chooses to watch it again I think it will be for the music.

It was gorgeous, it was catchy, it was imaginative...it was everything I hoped it would be and more! I loved seeing Ariel and her sisters as children with their mother and father, and I loved how the story gave them more screen time. When I was little I always wondered what the individual sisters were like. Flounder is cute and funny in this movie. I also really liked Benjamin, he's just so cute and matter-of-fact. This movie also has several scenes that pay homage to the original, such as Flounder getting stuck in a hole and Ariel pushing him out. The only thing I could complain about is that the story was so direct and simple, like a 30 minute cartoon that got extended. I'm not really sure how to put it, I don't mean it in a bad way. It's like a really epic and gorgeously animated extended episode...or something, yeah?

Jodi Benson is back as Ariel's voice and it captures all the beauty and quality of the original movie (unlike Belle's Enchanted Christmas where the voice of Belle seems to have been declined quite a bit).

I love everything about Ariel and her friends, so when I heard another movie was coming I was thrilled. And as a HUGE fan I thought the movie was great. There were only a few issues. The first of which was of course the music. The few songs that were original were great such as Athena's Song, I Remember, and I Will Sing, however they should've been longer. There were other opportunities for original music that I wish the creators would have pursued.

That being said everything else was wonderful...i wish it would've been longer and that the creators would've decided to bring Ursula back like they intended but Marina was entertaining to watch.

This movie answers those questions.  One reviewer said the accidental death of Ariel's mom was not for kids.  I guess that means The Lion King, Bambi, and Snow White where intended and plotted murder transpires, aren't for kids either then!

My now 4 year old is satisfied that she understands the story better and how Flounder became her best friend as well.  She's watched it 3 x times in two days since we got it, so I call it a kiddie hit.
Also the movie features the obedient but vainly shallow other 6 sisters; one can understand how curious and intelligent Ariel, the last daughter and more resembling her mother than the other children, just doesn't really fit in to their sorority.  They tell her she ""just doesn't know when to stop"".  It's no wonder she sought a better life on land.

The only out of place character is Benjamin (what is he a manatee?) the sidekick to Marina, the Ursula-lookalike governess to the 7 mermaid princesses.  Benjamin tries to be the voice of conscience and reason to the power hungry governess but just ends up looking like a sea-oaf.",1222560000,,1216,4.666666666666667

3009015,2,B000XUOIQO,"[SPOILERS!!]

Assuming that we take the character portrayals in the original as being correct, Flounder and Sebastian have been very altered in this film, particularly Flounder in that he is not the shy, mostly fearful (but brave if he really needs to be) ""guppy"" of the first film.  Marina is a weak villainess - an administrator and clothes horse who wants a more important job.  Benjamin is...I don't know, the Jar-Jar Binks of the film, in an unecessary attempt at comedy relief?  Some music is unoriginal, and the original music uninspired, which is unfortunate given the original talents and voice that did carry into this new film.
Several songs and Marina's costume changes in particular were completely anachronistic.
The one element that I DID enjoy (and allows me to give 2 stars) is the establishing of Ariel's sisters as actual characters, even if they did not get enough screen time.  It was good to see individual personalities and voices among them, rather than just have them as background.

Now, our children (daughter 5, son 8) enjoyed it well enough, but while The Little Mermaid is one of our daughter's favorites of all time (and is even her bedroom decor), this film did not even hold her attention through the entire story.",1221436800,3,1247,4.886255924170616

I truly enjoyed this movie, yes it wasn't like the original but look at all the Cinderellas they have made, they weren't like the original either. Ariel's beginning was in a way like the movie Footloose, no music or dancing is allowed in the city of Atlantis because King Tritain is heartbroken. But as always, the movie has a happy ending that leaves you feeling satisfyed that all is well. As well as being introduced to Ariel's mother you also learn and see more of Ariel's sisters. I felt that Disney did a good job overall and that I was glad I rented it from work. My little sister also watched it with me and came to the same conclusion.",1220918400,,749,4.514705882352941

One of the things I liked about this movie is that most of the original voice cast from the first movie returned for this one. Also, I have to admit I was surprised to find out that Sally Field was the voice of the ""villain"" in this movie.
The overall storyline is not bad for a Disney sequel: Ariel's mother died after being crushed by a ship. After that, King Triton banned all music from Atlantica. Of course, when Ariel is older she tries to change this and goes against her father.
There were some parts of the movie which weren't enjoyable. The music was a little bit corny and it just didn't match the first film. Also, compared to the villains from the first 2 movies, Marina del Rey just didn't cut it.",1220918400,,795,4.414965986394558

The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning also explains why King Triton didn't want Ariel (and the other citizens of his kingdom) to go up to the surface in the original movie and how Sebastian became the court composer.

The only thing I don't like is Flounder's new personality, but I still enjoyed this movie very much.

But, compared to other Disney theatrical releases this one is terrible. The animation is fine, but the writing is bad and the music isn't anything special. Also, there are any number of scenes/actions in the movie that I don't want my daughter emulating.

The best part of the movie is the credits (they're animated and set to music in the Monsters Inc. style).  The movie seemed promising when I read about it and pre-ordered it months ago, but it sure did fall short.

Disney is famous for killing off a parent, but they do it within two minutes of the movie. What used to be a touching moment in their animated classics, is now a cheap gimmick which disturbed my kids.

The animation quality is okay, but you can really tell they are taking shortcuts.

But most important is the storyline... I can't understand why they didn't work a little harder on a story that held a child's interest. My twin girls were so looking forward to this, and within twenty minutes they were squirming on the couch and looking for toys to play with.

Just a big disappointment. Disney should spend as much time creating the DVD as they do on marketing it.",1220659200,6,940,4.47953216374269

My 3.5 yr old watched this in tears on the way to ""the happiest place on earth"" and after meeting Mickey, Minnie and Goofy, still had nightmares about mommy dying.  Who the hell decided this was a good subject for a kids movie?",1220313600,5,264,4.36734693877551
3009043,4,B000XUOIQO,"This is a big summer for me, because my two tippy-top favorite Disney girls, Ariel and Tink (despite the fact that I really go for the Alice and Wendy performers the most at the theme parks), are getting very special DVD releases; direct-to-video prequels, to be specific. The first is out now, sometimes referred to as The Little Mermaid 3, but released as ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"".

The plot of this all new, thankfully traditionally animated feature (unlike the upcoming Tinker Bell CGI movie, though that one still looks good), involves King Triton's tragic loss of Ariel's mother, Queen Athena (And yes, we do see Athena in the film, and she looks more like Ariel than one would probably have imagined), and the way the entire kingdom is soon forced to suffer as he does. King Triton places a ban on all music in the kingdom of Atlantica, because music reminds him of his lost beloved, and this results in ten years of boredom and misery for Triton's subjects and his own seven lovely daughters. After that flashback, narrated by Sebastian the crab, we catch up with Triton and his family sometime during Ariel's fifteenth year, when an encounter with a new fish friend named Flounder leads her to discover a secret, underground club in which music is played and celebrated nightly. Ariel's curious and excitable sisters soon join her on her visits to the secret club, and this is their undoing. For their governess, the scheming Marina Del Ray, is out to get Sebastian's job, and that means she's out to get Sebastian, who just happens to be the illegal, musical nightclub proprietor and head entertainer. It's a rather simple plot about how music was brought back to the kingdom of Atlantica, which isn't a spoiler if you've seen the original film at all, with a mild villain thrown in for a little danger. Marina does turn out to be a threat, but the real hurdle for the heroes in the film is Triton and his anti-music agenda.

""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" is definitely a film that walks the line of great and disappointing probably more than any Disney sequel. It's beautifully animated for the most part, with my only real complaint being a few scenes of some significant music box figures done in CGI that looks unfinished in close-ups. The plot is not too shabby, but probably too simple to meet most adult viewers' hopes and expectations (yes, there are tons of adult Disney fanatics out there, like myself). Disney tends to aim its direct-to-video films more squarely at kids than its usually MUCH better bigscreen outings or even its animated TV shows. I consider this to be part of the problem with Disney's line of direct to video releases. Also, the villain of a Disney film is often the best aspect for most folks, and in this case, Sally Field's Marina Del Ray is a good character played beautifully, but not all that important as a villain and certainly not very imposing. She has a creepy pack of electric eels to increase her danger quotient though. Of course, she also has a comedic sidekick, a manatee named Benjamin (who seems to not require much oxygen), who I found a bit annoying really but others seem to enjoy.

The biggest problem with the story and the film itself though, for hardcore Little Mermaid fans anyway, is probably that it is hard to buy as a precursor to the original, classic Disney masterpiece. And don't get me started on how annoying it is that the direct-to-video prequel and sequel present Ariel's life as having 10 years of misery and deprivation in her childhood years and ten years of misery and deprivation at the start of her marriage. I know Anderson's mermaid was a tragic character, but this is the most internationally beloved Disney princess of them all! That's beside the point though. As I was saying, it is a bit hard to buy these events as having led up to the original film, and I consider the Disney animated TV series, which I suppose is no longer considered canon (though it is to me), to be a much better prequelization. Something that increases that feeling is the problem ""Ariel's Beginning"" had with character continuity. First, there's the issue of voices, most noticeably, King Triton's (though Ariel's sisters sound totally different from in the theatrical film too). Jim Cummings has taken over as the voice of King Triton after years of Kenneth Mars playing the role. Now, Jim Cummings is a Disney treasure, but he doesn't sound like Triton much at all, and it just doesn't work for me. In fact, of the two biggest complaints I've read about the characterizations in ""Ariel's Beginning"", that's one of them. The other is the character of Flounder. He is a completely different character in this film. Flounder, the cowardly ""guppy"" of the classic film and TV series, is presented here as a Baloo/King Louie wannabe with a rebellious streak. The saddest part is that the one scene in which he really acts just like the original Flounder can be found in the deleted scenes section.

But let's talk about chicks, man. Specifically, Ariel, the girl of my dreams, and her six hottie sisters. Ariel is voiced perfectly here by her original voice actress, Jodi Benson, whose voice is still straight from Heaven. And, thankfully, Ariel is totally in character in this movie. Her sisters finally get some decent screen time too, and I gotta tell ya, the exposure we get to Ariel's sisters here is one of the biggest strong points of ""Ariel's Beginning"". I came away from it absolutely adoring Arista.

Not a hot female, but also reprising his role perfectly here is the great Samuel E. Wright, who voices Sebastian the crab. Mr. Wright actually performs the most memorable song in the film, which unfortunately is not one of the new, original songs written for the film, but instead is the well-known ""Jump in the Line"". This song is performed twice in the film in two different ways, and it's the best musical aspect aside from Ariel singing ""I Remember"". Sadly, the original songs here are not very memorable. This is usually a problem with direct-to-video animated films that attempt to be musicals, and a prime example of a mistake frequently made is the villain's song here, ""Just One Mistake"", which attempts to emulate the song sang by Ursula in the first film but instead is just all over the place and fails to establish a catchy tune.

So, when all is said and done, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is a visually impressive, mildly entertaining new story about Ariel and her friends that unfortunately holds to very little character/story continuity and feels more like it takes place in a parallel universe rather than in the same one as the original film (and totally, disappointingly disregards the TV series; I hate it when they do that!). Honestly, though I still need to rewatch and review it (haven't seen it in a while), I'd be just as comfortable tossing ""The Little Mermaid 2"" into that parallel universe too. I don't care to see Ariel having another 10 years of sadness, nor do I care to see her married to anyone other than me, or with a kid I didn't sire. *ahem*

Folks who simply don't feel we need new stories about the Disney princesses shouldn't bother to watch or review this film, but for those of us who do, we would love to see more if they had this level of visual quality but were just written better. Of course, it is said that this is to be the last of the Disney direct-to-video prequels and sequels (we'll see about that), the Tink movie being more of a Fairy franchise thing like the Barbie DVDs, but the real problem was never the concept of making such films, it was just how much work, heart, talent, and of course money was put into them. ""Bambi 2"", despite the uninspired title, remains the best of the Disney animated sequels (aside from ""Rescuers Down Under"", of course) and is really an outstanding film with only the flaw of some all-too-modern sounding songs. ""Ariel's Beginning"" was one of the ones that came close to that level. Visually, it is beautiful. As a stand alone film, it's pretty good/enjoyable. Good enough for me to give it four stars. It just disregards too much of what has already been established as part of Ariel's universe, and writing down for a younger audience is never really a good thing. If they didn't have to do it for the bigscreen films, why do it for the direct-to-video ones? Is it worth a purchase though? Yes, unless you just hate Disney sequels. It's a good film that looks gorgeous on DVD (it's anamorphic widescreen, by the way). The continuity issues may make you mad, they may not, but it's a good film, and truly the real highlight is getting to know Ariel's sisters better. The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, song selections, a short behind-the-scenes featurette with the director, Peggy Holmes, a personality match game (I got Ariel, no cheating!) that is part of a bigger interactive experience that teaches you more about Ariel and her sisters by letting you explore their individual vanities, and the best extra is a behind the scenes look at the new ""The Little Mermaid"" Broadway musical, which I'm DYING to see. A couple of the sisters in that one are cuties too. If you're a fan of Ariel the Little Mermaid, yeah, it's a must purchase. I just so badly wish that Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" TV series would get a complete DVD release too.",1220140800,8,9330,4.713235294117647
3009044,4,B000XUOIQO,"I was extremely skeptical when I first heard about this movie, but was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended. The story is quite charming and it seems like this is one of the first sequels Disney writers gave some thought to.

The basic plot summary actually is that King Triton's kingdom is alive with music until his wife, Athena is killed in an accident. He is overwhelmed by grief and music only exacerbates his pain so he bans music forever. Ariel is still the headstrong girl from the original Little Mermaid movie and is unahppy with the status quo. She meets Flounder and winds up following him to an underground club, who is run by Triton's righthand crab, Sebastian. Ariel's emotions are stirred as she is moved by the music and she begins to remember what it was like before her mother died. She brings her sisters and they are all happy again, until Triton finds out.

What is nice about this movie is that instead of the usual hostile takeover theme to overthrow the king, the villian is actually after Sebastian's job. Marina Del Ray, who is a bit like Ursula without the sorcery, wants to climb the corporate ladder but has little desire to be royalty, an odd departure from the usual fairy tale faire. Her sidekick, Benjamin, who I think is a manatee, is not evil, which is also different. It seems that Disney ditched the formulaic method they have been using to compose their previous subpar sequels and created what Disney was after originally, a charming family movie that you can watch and smile and laugh at over and over again.",1220140800,,1554,4.647272727272727
3009045,4,B000XUOIQO,"My kids love it. I like it. The second Ariel movie was better. (Yes, I loved Return to the Sea.) This has less music, less new music, but it's a fun ride. It also helps explain why Ariel got away with being so stupid and rebellious in the original movie... that lesson was cemented here in the early years. Pout, defy dad, and run away will get what you want in the end! No wonder she tried it again in a few years! But that makes great fodder for conversation with the kids on what she should have done and how she should have done it. We've that that talk plenty after other Disney movies... which is something I happen to like about the Disney movies. My four year old has asked LOTS of questions about death, dying, running away, following rules, sharing etc... all from watching Cars, the Lion King, and the numerous princess movies.
This movie seems to lack some intangible magic that the first two Little Mermaids have, but I can't identify it,. But for kids yearning for more Ariel, this fits the bill!",1220140800,,1010,4.406417112299465
3009056,1,B000XUOIQO,"If you liked the part in Bambi where his mom died, you'll love this movie!  Why are so many Disney movies about the loss of a parent?  There are so few true rated ""G"" movies out there.  My daughter is 4 - too young for this movie - she spent the whole time trying to figure out what happened to the mother, where did she go?  Unlike other reviewers, I liked ""Return to the Sea.""  I thought it was beautiful to see Ariel as a mom.  She is a great one by the way.  Even Ursula's sister tells Ariel's disobedient daughter, ""you should have listened to your mom, kid!""  If you haven't seen that one, you may want to.

Technically called a prequel rather than a sequel as it ""takes place before that of a preexisting work or a sequel"", it does a poor job at that.  Generally a prequel answers questions about the lives of characters in the original story.  These ""characters"" don't even fit.  Why is Flounder such a ""guppy"" in the origional but so brave in the prequel?  Same with Sebastian!  It just doesn't fit.  I also can't believe Ursula and her sister(from Return to the Sea) are never even mentioned.  Most importantly, why does Ariel become so interested in life out of the sea, start her collection, or find her secret cave???  You won't find out in this movie!

If you are looking for a great movie for a young girl, check out the Barbie movies, especially Island Princess, Nutcracker, Rapunzel, and Swan Lake.  They are all much better than this movie.",1220140800,10,1458,4.413533834586466
3009057,1,B000XUOIQO,"... halfway thru this horrid production. I feel sorry for the folks involved ... Jodi Benson and the rest, they did there usual great job, but they had an absolutely AWFUL story to put across. Slow, boring and, I'm sorry, the banning of music from Atlantica is just too high a concept for conflict. Every movie in this vein has GOT to have some evil... Sally Field's ""Marina Del Rey"" character AIN'T it... she's just annoying.

I was also quite disappointed we only got to spend three minutes (if that) with Athena, Triton's lovely redheaded wife. No back story, no chance to care about her...just an odd scene with some hapless pirates and bad weather and she's gone. No tears, nothing... just a ban on music in Atlantica because Triton can't stand to hear 'their song' anymore. No laughs, poor music, and ho-hum 'production' numbers. I DID laugh when Sebastian turned out to be the 'star' of the underground music club.

Disney had a real chance to let us get to know Athena, find out where Ursula and Morgana came from and why they've such an ax to grind with Triton... some back story on Sebastian, maybe... but they squandered it. The original and the 'Return to the Sea' sequel are far better than this direct to the bargain bin by Halloween release.

3009058,1,B000XUOIQO,"Being a child of the 1980s, I have fond memories of The Little Mermaid. It was fun, great music, an epic movie of sorts. Looking at the reviews from others and based on what I viewed, we must have seen completely different films because ""The Little Mermaid- Ariel's Beginning"" was outright dull, boring and horrific. I know, I'm probably not the target audience but even my younger sister said this movie wasn't anything like the first one and even the dreadful second movie which was, like this, a direct-to-dvd release.

Basically, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is The Little Mermaid mixed with ""Footloose"". It's forbidden to sing or make music in Atlantis, the kingdom ruled by Ariel's father. But alas, Ariel and company decide to take on the crown and dare to dance and spread the love of music throughout the kingdom! Yet, here's the problem- for a movie about embracing music, the actual music in the film was absolutely horrendous. This franchise, to me, is founded upon music and good songs. Even the second film had a spread of musical numbers but this? No. The few musical numbers are simply horrible and uninspired if even listenable. They even perform one song, best known from being the song featured in the final scene of 'Beetlejuice' a whopping THREE times in the film! Talk about unoriginal.

What a butchering of a great franchise. So what, it's animated. Big whoop, there's nothing groundbreaking about it. Even my younger sister said this, when stacked against the other films, was by far the worse. I wouldn't waste my money on this boring, dull, uninspired drivel. Save it and put it towards the two-disc special release of the first film - it'd be much better spent and used.",1219968000,21,1689,4.820689655172414
3009059,5,B000XUOIQO,"""Ariel's Beginning"" is a fun animated feature that had my 3.5 year old daughter asking for more. The story is the prequel to The Little Mermaid - it tells the story of how King Triton lost his beloved wife Athena in an accident [back when Ariel and her sisters were little] and thus banned music and all forms of gaiety in his kingdom, living in seclusion and with darkness within his heart. When the pirncesses grow up, they all chafe against the restrictions imposed by King Triton, especially Ariel who, like her mother, loves music and singing. Ariel starts to dabble in music secretly, much to her father's anger and finally runs away with Sebastian in tow, until Triton realises his folly.

It is in this movie that we find out how Ariel meets and befriends Flounder, and how Sebastian becomes the music conductor in Triton's court. There is also a villain in the form of nanny, Marina del Rey, though she is not as scary or menacing as Ursula, the sea witch in The Little Mermaid.

Ok, it is not as enchanting as The Little Mermaid, but all in all, I thought it was a decent effort by Disney, considering some of the other animated features out there.

The songs in this feature are not as catchy as in The Little Mermaid, but they are still pleasing and fun. The songs here are: I Remember, I Will Sing, Athena's Song,Just One Mistake,Jump In The Line [Shake, Senora], and  Man Smart, Woman Smarter.

The extras include Deleted Scenes, Music and More [the Disney Song Selection option allows the words of the songs to appear on screen, making it easy for sing-alongs], Games and Activities [Mermaid Discovery Vanity Game- allows viewers to unearth secrets about the princesses by clicking on their personal scrapbooks, or compare which of King Triton's daughters you are most like with the Personality Profile Game]. There is also a Backstage Disney feature [a behind the scenes featurette centring on  animation director Peggy Holmes].

I watched this with my little one, and we were both entertained - so much so that we watched it again! Having been long-time Little Mermaid fans [me longer than my little one of course:)], this was a delightful addition to our collection of Disney features.",1219968000,22,2203,4.7513089005235605

The Little Mermaid is by far my favorite, I own all three movies and love them all. This one was not as action packed as the first thats true and I do believe the storyline could've been a little more devloped but all in all it was worth my money and time. It was deffenetly better then cinderellaI II which was a complete waste in my opinion because it had absolutely no relevence to the first Cinderella, whareas this movie I think gives a nice tie in to the others.

3009061,4,B000XUOIQO,"This movie In my opinion was well done and better than expected. The story line was ok, not the best. But I am glad they showed the story of Ariel's mother. It also clears up why King Triton was so upset with Ariel going to the surface in the original,since his wife died with a pirates ship.
Nice movie and was better than the Return to the sea movie,nice music,a little childish at times but it is a movie for kids.
I was not disappointed with this movie and the Bonus features are nice.",1219968000,,489,4.212765957446808
3009062,4,B000XUOIQO,"Upon watching this movie, I was actually pretty impressed! Like some others have said, the story is pretty basic, nothing too intricate or complicated about it. I did enjoy the opening where it tells the story of Ariel's mother. I also thought, in general, that this movie had wonderful animation! It's far superior to all of the other straight to DVD Disney sequels/prequels, and dare I say the animation may be better than the ORIGINAL. Although the original is a good, what...20 years old now? I still thought they did an excellent job with the movie overall. My 2 year old loves the Little Mermaid, and I'm glad I got it for her. :)",1219795200,,636,4.587719298245614
3009063,3,B000XUOIQO,"My daughter absolutely LOVES Ariel and both Little Mermaid 1 & 2 so I figured this movie would be, at the very least, entertaining for her.  While she did sit through it the 1st time, when I offered to let her watch it again, she agreed but it didn't hold her interest enough for her to watch it all again (and she has seen the other 2 movies many times each!)  It just didn't hold her (or my) attention very well.  The annimation, as others have said, IS very good - nothing close to the crappy TV show so no worries about that.  The background we get about Ariel's mother is nice, albeit VERY brief...the whole movie is based on the premise that her mother was so into music that her tragic death upsets Triton so much he can't bear to have music in Atlantica anymore.  But all we get is ONE very short scene of her singing to her 7 daughters as the are put to bed.  And then yeah, we get to see Ariel's look-alike mother making out w/Triton, which IS a little creepy.  Still, you get that they really loved each other but seeing as the whole storyline is based on her love of music, I just wish we had seen more.  More scenes of the mother w/Ariel.  Maybe some mention of the fact that Ariel and her mother look exactly alike - what does that do to Triton...is this what keeps him so protective of her?  The background on the other characters is cute (Sebastian and Flounder) and the scenes at the secret nightclub are cute too but overall, the music is pretty terrible.  Most notably, the 1st song by Sally Field is pretty unbearable.  It's mainly spoken, and not musically.  Even a Jodie Benson song (can't recall the exact name) is pretty bad, which is saying a lot.  I was pretty excited about the music when I saw the short preview (which is the 1st scene in the movie, w/her mother singing her to sleep) but after this, it pretty much disappoints - sometimes badly.  The sidekick to the villianess IS out of place, although I found him to at least provide some comic relief.  As for the extras, we really only enjoyed the behind the scenes look at the Broadway show.  The pencil drawing ""deleted scenes"" were not interesting (especially to a 4 year old!) and we couldn't get through the behind the scenes look w/the director - just didn't hold our interest.  I liked that they provided the songs in their own feature, until we listened to them again and only found ourselves liking the 1st (mothers's lullaby).  To rewatch that Sally Field song was torture!  I would have so much preferred a movie where maybe Ariel relays her childhood to her daughter, or maybe even grandaughter.  Or possibly has more intimate memories of her mother.  Or even just a movie w/her CHILDhood, not necessarily her teen years.  I'd say I was most pleased with the fact that the villian doesn't actually get slayed in the end, which is a bit of a switch (although for that song, she should have been!)  So, while it will certainly do for little fans of Ariel (can they ever get enough of her?) it just doesn't make the grade.",1219795200,,3014,4.4086799276672695

Likewise, the animation is well-done, but pales in comparison to the theatrically-released original.

Still, young children may find enough to like about the antics of Ariel and her sisters.

But I must say that Ariel's Beginning was very well done.  The animation was great!  You could tell that they actually put some effort into it, and as far as the plot, not exactly original or thought provoking, but I wasn't bored; it was decent.  I laughed quite a few times, mostly because of the Yzma-like Villain and her very strange henchman, and a frantic octopus.  The songs were not really all that memorable, but I wasn't annoyed by them.  Overall the movie was worth watching, and if you are a Disney Movie collector I deem this one worthy, unlike Return to the Sea, to sit on the same shelf as all the rest.",1219795200,2,910,4.261627906976744
3009067,2,B000XUOIQO,"If you wanted to know what happened to Ariel's mother, the first 5min of this movie will tell you. After that, the movie is a complete waste of time with some pretty terrible music.

Jodi Benson's voice is great as usual. But they give her horrible material to sing to. Why can't they get decent song writers at Disney anymore?

The movie would have been a million times better if it featured Ursula and why she was banished from the kingdom. Instead, we get some new sucky villain who sings sucky songs and has a bizarre relationship with a green monster who looks like it had been playing in nuclear waste.

Ariel's mother strangely is an exact replica of Ariel. Which means, while Triton is romantic with her, it looks like he's getting it on with his daughter. Which is pretty creepy.

2 stars for some good animation, thankfully. But other than that, it's another sequel/prequel that doesn't come close to living up to the original movie.",1219795200,4,943,4.62874251497006

Ariel's parents relationship is the main focus here and you get to see the sisters grow up. Sweet movie. I was pumped since I saw the teaser trailer a long time ago. Ariel is my favorite princess and though there is no mushy love plot with her, it still is a sweet disney movie for those of all ages.",1219795200,3,468,4.390804597701149
3009069,1,B000XUOIQO,"I've watched this movie and I think it was awful. Disney's magic is gone! The movie begins okay, laughter, happiness, but then it takes a turn for the worst; first of all, King Triton would never ban music (the whole kingdom must have hated him AND he made his daughters sad (which he would try to avoid at any cost since he loves them)). There is NO character development (and Ariel is only little in the beginning, so I was hugely disapointed when she was 14-15 through out the movie), Flounder is SHY (and in the disney-series Ariel and flounder go way back, not just a year or two) and he shouldn't be so strait forward as he is in this movie. There's 1 original song in this movie, the rest is bad covers of already known hits! Please, The little Mermaid won Oscars for the music! This only proves that Disney should not make sequals to already great movies! And where did Ursula go? She clearly said in the first movie that she'd lived in the palace, was that *15* yrs earlier, before Ariel was born?

And that purple haired mermaid, in her song they showed her wearing train clothes and other outfits that probably didn't exist during The little mermaid, same goes for her military clotes (Disney, come on, don't mix up the time line!)

I would give this movie -5 if I could, it's plain horrible.",1219795200,14,1303,4.447698744769874
3009070,4,B000XUOIQO,"Ever since Disney's ""sequels"" department has been under new management, there has been a HUGE upgrade in quality. There have only been two animated releases so far, Cinderella III and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning. I am not sure if any more sequels are in production.

Consistent between both films is the very high quality animation. TLM:AB keeps CGI to a minimum and much effort has been made to keep the characters close to the original character models (and in many cases, character models have heavily improved over the original). This is probably as good as it will get without the original team of animators.

What saves this film is the fantastic hand-drawn animation in the age of ugly CGI and lazy flash-drawn cartoons. I would go as far as to say that the animation here is on-par or higher than the original 1989 release (the original was plagued with off-model animation). Unfortunately, the story is only so-so. The plot is very weak but effort has been made to develop all of the sisters' personalities, which I really appreciate (they are believable sister to sister relationships). I think Disney recognised that without Alan Menken, the music for TLM would not have charm or beauty. Disney did the right thing for this film by keeping songs short and to a minimum.

This film highly deserves a chance to be seen by many, unlike the rushed and horrible Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.",1219795200,4,1415,4.814814814814815
3009071,5,B000XUOIQO,I actually gave this movie a try. Being a Little Mermaid fan since a young kid. I loved this movie. It was very intense and sad.

Very good!!!!,1219708800,,301,4.298245614035087
3009072,5,B000XUOIQO,"I think there should be a rule against leaving a review for something you haven't even seen!
I'm giving this one 5 stars because its a great sequal. Maybe 4 stars if it were something I went to see at the movies.  I was doubtful that this movie would be anything more than 90 minutes of poor-quality animation with a weak story line and annoying songs, given that this is what Disney sequals have amounted to over the years. Fortunately, this movie is different than those other disappointing sequals. The first thing I noticed was how much nicer the animation is in this movie than in previous Disney sequals. The animation stays fairly true to the original Little Mermaid movie and doesn't look like a series of computer coloring page!  Not only that but the storyline is really very sweet. (my daughters were really turned off by the first sequal that showed Arieal growing up and becoming a mother...gross)  I think this movie does a nice job of adding some depth to the original story. As a mother of teenage daughters who grew up with Disney Princesses, this is a nice addition to our collection. I hope that Disney continues to release more quality movies like this one instead of just throwing things together quickly to capitalize on the demand for all things princess.",1219708800,8,1278,4.696428571428571
3009073,3,B000XUOIQO,"I wouldn't say this movie was great I mean there really isn't any tention, we know that Ariel eventually does get music back in the kingdom because of the other 2 movies. I can't say I loved the songs either, this movie compared to the other two movies, it just doesn't pass. I love the first and second movies, because it moved the story along. The only things this movie tells us is exactly why triton is the way he is in the first movie and what happened to ariels mother.

I think it would have made more sense to base the thrid movie after the events of the second. Like have Morgana come back, after she was never killed only frozen, it's possible. I mean why leave an opened ending like that and then make perquel to the first instead? I doesn't make any sense to me. This movie diffinatly needed a better plot.

I just finished watching this new Little Mermaid and I am sad to say it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for. This movie is suppoused to be all about music in Atlantic and Ariels mother so I had hoped there would be some really great songs on here but there just wasnt. The song that her Mother Athena sings she only sung for like 4-5 lines long it wasn't even a whole song which was disappointing cause it just sounded like it would have been a very good one had it been alot longer. Also Triton and Ariels song they don't even really sing its more some words of the song was said then anything and a little music. The song Ariel sings in the underground club ""I Remember"" was Good but it of course wouldnt be a favorite like ""Part of Your World"" For a review I read previously on how someone hoped for a song with the sisters, sorry to disappoint but they don't sing at all although they talk and are involved so much more in this one which was a plus for me. I guess I just expected too much for this movie it just seemed so good from the trailers which they showed about all the good parts there are anyway. There was an excellent time I thought in there for Ariel to sing a great song when she finds the music box and remembers more of her mother but to a great disappointment to me there wasnt. So to narrow it all down I loved that the sisters were more involved and talking but my biggest disappoint me was there just wasn't any Great Songs on there except the ones you don't even hear much of so that makes it pointless to listen to. Maybe they will come out with a soundtrack and it will have the whole song on there it would be great if they did but the movie just disappointed me. I DID love it because I love the Little Mermaid but it was just disappointing.",1219708800,,1901,4.031746031746032
3009075,4,B000XUOIQO,"I was totally expecting another disaster, like ""Return to the sea"". Ugh! That movie was a true agony to sit through! The story of return to the sea wasn't at all bad (it really had potential to make a good movie) but the animation was horrible and so were the songs. I couldn't stand it! That's why I was so pleasantly surprised by ""Ariel's Beginning"". It had a few good songs and some nice remakes of some old songs that I heard Harry Belafonte sing a LONG time ago. It also has a rather good story and the animation is nearly as good as the original movie. That's kind of sad because with all the CGI tools available these days, they should have been able to surpass animation of the original movie.
Now for the ultimate compliment. I've seen the move and liked it so much that I'm ordering the DVD. I want to see the extras and hear the commentary, plus buying the DVD is the only way I have to tip the people who created it. It's the only way I can compliment their work, and this work deserves recognition.

Is it worthy of a big screen release? Not necessarily; it is a low-key story, but nonetheless, a VAST improvement over some of Disney's previous direct-to-dvd movies. The story is a prequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000F8O35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>,"" and explains how King Triton banned music in his kingdom when his wife was killed. We learn how Sebastian became the music conductor for King Triton, and how Ariel & Flounder met. Naturally, it is the full-of-life Ariel who helps bring music back to her father's life. Although the villain is not as fun and nasty as the legendary Ursula, Marina Del Rey (ably voiced by Sally Field) is plenty of fun as the evil governess for King Triton's daughter. Not content to be a governess, she plots to usurp Sebastian's position, even if it means getting rid of Ariel. The one odd character in the movie is Marina's sidekick, Benjamin. His style of animation looks like something out of Barney. It is particularly jarring since the animation on this film is SOOOO good! It does not look like your typical straight-to-dvd release; in fact, I would go so far as to say that it is on par with the original feature. Jodi Benson returns as the voice of Ariel. In both singing and acting, she is fantastic and totally believeable as the songstress under the sea. As Sebastian, Samuel E. Wright returns...who else could voice this classic animated character? There are seven musical numbers in the film, and the fact that it was directed by a choreographer (Peggy Holmes) is a plus. The movement of the characters in the film AND the dance numbers is fantastic.

Extras are also great. 2 backstage Disney featurettes: ""Splashdance"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, hosted by director Peggy Holmes. ""The Little Mermaid: Under the Sea and Behind The Scenes On Broadway"" gives a backstage look at the Broadway musical production, featuring interviews with the cast.

I look forward to her work in this new story as well.
Most Disney gets a few tears out of me, because it's so good at strumming the heart strings.

You're not telling things from a minor character or villain's POV here; just tying up loose ends that weren't ENDS or LOOSE. In the Original, you have an overprotective merman king that raising 7 daughters ALONE, flees  for safety when ships sail above, and sees humans as DANGEROUS Enemies??? Not a big leap to conclude that humans led to Triton becoming a widower in the first place. This story could had been condensed down, re-cut with the original as sold as a ""deluxe edition"".

Spoiler alert : I find it incredible silly when Ariel's mother went back to save her music box given by king Triton, when her whole family, including her husband was safe already from the pirates and waiting for her.  She chose to save a sentimental musical gift given by king Triton instead of actually being with him and her daughters. Really?  The nanny's facial features looks a lot like Ursula.

I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection.

The music in the original is just classic but this one has very little original music. And the original music in it is not very good. Maybe it's just me but it feels like they didn't even try with this movie. My daughter loves the characters and she likes this movie but she doesn't love it and I feel the same way that she does.

We didn't hate it but we didn't love it and we just almost like it. Knowing then what I know now I would not have purchased this movie.

3243101,5,B000XUOIQO,"If you compare this film to The Little Mermaid, it's almost the polar opposite. The Little Mermaid had very thin characters, sketchy animation, a thin plot, a very high budget, and outstanding music with award-winning songs. On the other hand, this film has gorgeous animation that is very solid looking, very well-developed characters, a plot that's a bit of stretch but more developed, a lower budget, and songs that are almost an after-thought. I still like it better.

I've always thought the world of The Little Mermaid was an interesting one, and the music is enchanting. That said, I've always hated the sea witch, and found the romance awkward and the actual portrayal of the world to be very, very, thin. After re-watching The Little Mermaid much older than my first viewings in the theater, I kept wondering about Ariel's sisters, what life was supposed to actually be like in the kingdom, why her father was such a grouch, how she got to be friends with Flounder, etc, etc. This film nicely fills in all the details.

The aspect of the film I like the very most is that each of Ariel's sisters actually has a personality and interaction with each other, unlike the placeholders that were her sisters in the Feature Film. I was also quite glad to ditch the annoying comic relief of the seagull and instead have every character exist to tell the story rather than to be purely goofball distraction. There's no epic stakes in this film, no horrific battle between good and evil or whatever, but then again, I never liked that in the first film.

Instead there's a simple Footloose-style story about a kingdom where music is outlawed, a jealous social-climber, and a very sincerely, beautiful,and musically gifted protagonist. As opposed to the headstrong over-emotionalism of Ariel in The Little Mermaid, she a much more balanced person here, and a lot more likable. Likewise, while her father is a bit of an overbearing tyrant, at least he isn't a clueless menacing authority figure who seems to exist only to yell at his kids and terrify his subjects like in the TLM.

Yeah, there's no oscar-worthy songs to be had here, but there is a nice little Aria for Ariel to sing (Jodie Benson, you are one of my heroes), and plenty of style of music that was EVERYWHERE after The Little Mermaid came out (come on, you guys claim to be Little Mermaid fans and don't remember the MASSIVE wave of coverage that Sebastian's steel-drum fueled island rhythms sent around the world?). Yeah, the villain can't sing, and more full-blown musical numbers in the style of the first-film would have been great, but the songs here are far fro terrible. I'd say they are about on the level of the excellent Lion King sequels.

If you have an open mind and a thirst for traditional animation assisted by computers, this film is light and fluffy, and gorgeous to behold. And yeah, I can't get enough of Jodie Benson as Ariel either. I don't own The Little Mermaid, but I own this film. It's very enjoyable, even though the plot does jump around a bit and is on the silly/flimsy side. It's more than made up for by the great characters and animation.

Apparently, that was enough for the distraught King Triton to banish music from his kingdom......FOREVER!  Yeah, that didn't make any sense to me either but there it is.  The tyrant forbids everyone from listening to and/or participating in song.  They can't even hum a mournful tune.  Not a ditty to be had anywhere.  So sad.  And incomprehensibly stupid, what is this a fascist state under the sea!?  Well, at least they weren't burning books.  Meanwhile, there's this EVIL governess (voiced by Sally Field) who rides roughshod over the seven sad mopey daughters of King Triton.  They spend their time primping and whining while the EVIL governess plots to overthrow Sebastian (voiced by Samuel E. Wright) so she can become second only to the sad and dictatorial King.  And!  Once again, the angry despot wields his trident and ruins everyone's fun.  Characters are thrown in a dungeon.  There's a prison break.  A double homicide is mentioned and attempted.  It's all quite jolly.  The songs, if you can call them that, are entirely forgettable and fortunately few in number.  They do perform a version of Jump in the Line (Shake, Shake, Shake, Senora) that feels oddly out of place, but in this case seems par for the course.  At least it's not quite as objectionable as the second cartoon in this series (known as the BIG mistake).  This one at least makes for passable entertainment.

3243182,2,B000XUOIQO,"I didn't even know until recently that there was a third Little Mermaid movie, and being the huge fan I am of the original film, I just had to watch this.  I'm sad to say I was really disappointed.

The story is very predictable and hardly original.  The music is forgettable.  And ""Shake Shake Senora""?  Seriously?  The villain and her sidekick are just horrible and annoying, they can't even hold a candle to Ursula, heck, even Morgana.  And Flounder is completely out of character.
The animation on the other hand is pretty nicely done for a direct-to-dvd release.  Nothing compared to the hand-drawn, hand-painted original movie, but good.  Getting to see more of Ariel's sisters was my favorite part.

Overall, I'm sure kids will like this movie, but older fans?  Probably not.  I'm not a huge fan of the Little Mermaid II, but even that sequel is much better than this.  I hate leaving negative reviews, but honestly, I found this movie forgettable and boring.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either.",1407628800,,1014,4.786127167630058

I rated this based on my kids suggestion. (They wanted a 2.5 / 5 and I rounded down since I was displeased.) It really would have been better if it weren't Ariel's story.,1405641600,,312,4.131147540983607

I did like the movie, but I did expect much more. It was only an hour and 17 minutes long. I don't really like it when movies use both animation with cartoon, it clashes.

It wasn't like a little mermaid movie. Ariel only sang once and the song wasn't much. There wasn't much to the story either. Yes, it was a good movie, but I was disappointed.",1365465600,,461,4.168539325842697

The songs in this movie by no means compare to the original The Little Mermaid, but they are still catchy at times.
The plot is expected, but fun: making it a great movie for any kid.
Some of the voice actors are lacking in their original skillfulness, but that is to be expected with a prequel/sequel that is developed several years later.

I have not seen this movie but I have heard plenty enough. It's a disgrace to The Little Mermaid francise, especially the really good television series! The way Ariel and Flounder met in the series when they were cute kids was so good, yet they substitute it in a movie of absolutely nothing. The only thing I can compliment is the animation looking much more modern than the other direct to video films. But that doesn't change the bad choices they made for this story. King Triton is at his worst; he's a total jerk! There's the fact that they've put King Triton and Ariel through another major conflict when they've already had enough in the original movie, there's the fact that bringing music to Atlantica has no point to the original film, it's-I-er-IT'S SO TERRIBLE!!!!",1351209600,2,905,4.69811320754717

3243377,3,B000XUOIQO,"When you watch this movie, you will release something is terribly wrong. Well, not right from the start.

This movie opens with a wonderful scene featuring Ariel's mother, a younger King Trident (with a brown beard!), and all of their young children hanging out on rocks on the surface. Since we all know what happened to Ariel's mother, we know something sad is about to happen. This takes over about the first seven minutes of the film.

Being a prequel, this is before 1. King Trident is noticeably far more angry and withdrawn, so much that he doesn't want to hear any music. His time spent with his daughters consists of a short walk in the morning. This gives the movie an interesting tone.

But what happens next goes downhill. We get introduced to the girl's caretaker, ""Marina Del Rey,"" and ""Benjamin."" To start, Benjamin is so lazily animated that he doesn't even fit in the rest of the movie, which is above normal quality for direct-to-dvd Disney films. ""Marina Del Rey"" is a very typical female villian; all about the glamour, ready to decieve and steal, etc. In fact, all she really is comes off to be the poor man's (or women's) Ursula, who was very unique and down-right great. In fact, Morgana from Little Mermaid II was a thousands times better.

The movie moves into more trouble. Does anyone remember little Flounder, scared and terrified of everything? Apparently in this so-called ""prequel,"" he dances to music and acts obnoxious. Um, what? This makes no sense.
Not a whole lot happens at this point-they do some traveling, being a club dancing to ""Shake Senora""(can't even come up with an original song), and have more trouble with the evil Marina Del Rey. Her song on her own pails terribly to anything done by Ursula or Morgana. In fact, it's terrible.

So the ""big conclusion"" has ""Marina Del Rey"" unleashing electric eels on the characters, and them ultimately winning, with Marina and Benjamin being put in jail. Right there, it is so obvious that the movie had a chance to be far more than it was. With a female character who uses magic, uses electric eels as weapons, doesn't she seem to have some connection to Ursula? Why not turn her into a pre-Ursula, have her be cursed to be an octopus, or change, or anything? It is ultimately the uninspired, boring villian that brings down the movie from it's little mistakes.

This movie is far from terrible. The beginning is actually very good. However, if you are looking for a good sequel to the original Little Mermaid, the 2nd one with her daughter and Morgana was far better, darker, more detailed, and never ""out-of-character.""

Overall the high ratings of this movie are not deserved, though it is better than many Disney direct-to-dvd sequels.",1313884800,3,2726,4.750528541226216
3243378,4,B000XUOIQO,"Direct-to-video Disney spin-offs can be pretty hit-or-miss - ""The Little Mermaid II,"" for example, was an atrocity that I would not recommend to the most undistinguishing, mermaid-obsessed four-year-old; ""Ariel's Beginning,"" on the other hand, is a much much much better attempt at re-creating the atmosphere of the original movie.

Overall, it's not as good as the original - there are some silly bits, for example, a character death in the beginning.  The character is crushed to death against some rocks (completely offscreen and implied, there's nothing graphic about it at all) by a ship, which was apparently being sailed by ridiculously incompetent crewmen...despite the lovely sunny weather, they did not notice either the huge rock formations or the thirty mermaids who were lounging around on them.  -_-

There also wasn't much depth to the plot or script, but they weren't bad, either.  The voice acting was excellent, and the animation in particular was very beautiful, on par with the original film; that's actually what I liked the most.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you have young kids to entertain or are a die-hard Disney fan, but if you do fall into one or both of those categories, this is definitely a movie to pick up.",1312675200,,1244,5.04390243902439

The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.

Seriously, they have ""Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)"" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.

3243398,4,B000XUOIQO,"Even though as a grown up man, I still have the disney fever in me, I ended up purchasing this DVD. I've been in love with the Little Mermaid ever since I saw it and still am. However, this is NOT a sequel to Little Mermaid 2 as I thought it was advertised as but rather a prequel to the first movie. As I am not going to spoil about the story I am simply going to tell that it gave us more about Ariels family that we never saw in the first two movies. In this movie for the first time we got to see Ariels sisters as well as her mother ""Athena"" who we never knew off and why she wasn't in Ariels life in the first movie.
The story is good and has some heart to it, but not enough to movie you as the first one did. We also get to see a side of Ariels father King Triton that we never saw. The movie had heart in it but most of the time its all fun and games. Which leads me to my second point. Since its a prequel to the first movie, it goes somewhat against the television series of Little Mermaid that we used to see in the early 90's and has changed some of the story. It gives a completely different spin off of what we saw in the series. My Final point is that it would have been better as a series not a movie. The story doesn't exactly fit the requirements that makes it a movie to watch but rather if it was on the Television series then that would have made more sense. Like I said earlier, the story wasn't good enough for a movie but for a series. Disney shouldn't have made this as a movie and should have brought in something that should have been good rather than making a rather pointless third movie. As a fan of the Little Mermaid I was expecting more however it didn't beat my expectations at all.
Now that I've mentioned the bad, the reason why I would give it a four star is because when you have all three movies, and you wanted to show the little mermaid like my 5 and 8 year old cousins or even children, then this version is the one they would enjoy more. The animation is way better than we've seen in a ling time , you can clearly tell that animation has significantly improved. While the first movie was awesome but with todays kids, love stories aren't something they would watch and love the movie, rather they would enjoy this movie better. It brings little children to watch and the little ones would want to watch this over and over again and, its not something a family can't watch. Rather I would recommend this as something families can sit and watch together. The story is good enough to prevent people from forwarding the movie as well. And its good to see Ariel again and who doesn't!!
Its a good family movie to watch with kids that what I would tell you.",1296518400,,2696,4.107954545454546

3243400,1,B000XUOIQO,"This movie was disappointing.  My 4 year old LOVES Ariel and begged me for the DVD, so I put it on her Amazon wish list after reading positive reviews and glancing through the negative reviews.  I didn't have a problem with the fact that Ariel's mother dies in this prequel(we already know she is not in the original movie).  It was just set up and shown horribly in the first few minutes of the movie, and after that my daughter was in tears anytime a slightly scary part would occur, so I finally resulted to covering her eyes during the last and longest ""scary"" scene.  The main ""bad person"" (the purple hair character scowling on the DVD front) and especially her manatee sidekick were completely pointless, and therefore just annoying anytime they were on screen.  Her pet eels were too scary looking for a rated G movie (much worse than the eels or the shark in the original).  She also calls her sidekick an ""idiot,"" and sings a couple of terrible songs.

My daughter and I loved the beginning 2 minutes or so of the movie, showing Ariel as a preschool age child, as well as showing how much her parent's loved each other.  It's too bad the movie didn't spend more time on this part of Ariel's life.  Another positive are the interactions between Ariel and her sisters.  The last few minutes were good, showing how music and co(he walor returned to the kingdom.  Sebastian was true to character; Flounder was not.  The king was also too dark of a character for most of the movie (unbelievably so).  King Triton's banning of music, as well as his pair of swordfish guards would have provided enough scary and suspenseful scenes without the addition of the intended ""bad"" characters.  This one will be consigned, and we'll try the other Ariel movie on Netflix first before putting it on her wish list.",1294704000,3,1806,4.603125

But I hate the story line! The film does not introduce Ariel's life properly, It does not include the ""main"" concepts of the story of Ariel's life as a child. However, in the film we do see Ariel's mother for the first time,(who looks just like Ariel) and how she died, but that is it!!!
then the plot starts out as music being forbidden from Atlantica ""forever"", *YAWN*
The film is mostly centered around music, which if you ask me; is really lame!
The animated Series provided more information than this film did, and in the series Ariel met Flounder when she was very young, not when she was 15!
I only wish this film included the ""Key Concepts"" of the beloved story, such as...
How Ariel became infatuated with the human world
and How Ursula Was banished from Atlantica.

It doesn't stick to the first two at all.  I think Disney could have given us a great back story on the original characters but blew their chance.  This plot was stupid, the music was awful, and I think Disney should have left well enough alone and not made this.

3243416,5,B000XUOIQO,"After recently seeing the original film and its rushed-looking, mediocre-written sequel, I wasn't sure what to expect with this film.

I was blown away - this is one of the best Disney Direct-to-Video sequel/prequels I've ever seen!

The story starts with Ariel's childhood, and the sad death of her mother which drove King Triton into emotional trauma, unable to deal with his daughters as they grew up, banning music from Atlantica because the reminders of his wife were too painful. The story then jumps ahead to Ariel at 14 years old (two years before the original movie), and the now-silently miserable kingdom of Atlantica, with sharks working as anti-music security guards, arresting anyone who so much as dares to whistle.

The daughters of Triton are being mostly raised by their nasty governess Marina Del Rey, who covets Sebastian's position in the Royal Court, and is looking for any opportunity to seize it from him. She is helped by a soft-spoken and kind-hearted narwhal (I think he's a narwhal) named Benjamin.

While being punished for breaking the rules, Ariel meets a fish named Flounder, and later at night follows him to an underground club where inhabitants of Atlantica play music and dance until all hours - including a performance by Sebastian of Harry Belafonte's ""Jump in the Line"" (which some moviegoers will remember from ""Beetlejuice""), which is so lively that you can't help wanting to sing and dance along!

But secrets have a way of being exposed, leading to a quest by Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian to find a special item that once belonged to her mother, in hopes of bringing change to Atlantica.

The animation is well done, shaded with depth in a similar style to the first movie, and makes this a worthy entry in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" saga. (By comparison, the animation in LM2 is well drawn, but the rest of it is poorly colored and looks rushed).  I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it surpassed my expectations! Well worth buying!",1269993600,,1995,4.884615384615385
3243417,2,B000XUOIQO,"After watching Little Mermaid 2, I was quite excited for this sequel.  The story line is a bit depressing.  Not only does her mother die (this is Disney afterall) but then the whole story is about how her father is a real downer afterwards.  There's not enough time and too many sisters to really get a good handle on who is who.  The music is good.  If my daughter chooses to watch it again I think it will be for the music.

It was gorgeous, it was catchy, it was imaginative...it was everything I hoped it would be and more! I loved seeing Ariel and her sisters as children with their mother and father, and I loved how the story gave them more screen time. When I was little I always wondered what the individual sisters were like. Flounder is cute and funny in this movie. I also really liked Benjamin, he's just so cute and matter-of-fact. This movie also has several scenes that pay homage to the original, such as Flounder getting stuck in a hole and Ariel pushing him out. The only thing I could complain about is that the story was so direct and simple, like a 30 minute cartoon that got extended. I'm not really sure how to put it, I don't mean it in a bad way.

Jodi Benson is back as Ariel's voice and it captures all the beauty and quality of the original movie (unlike Belle's Enchanted Christmas where the voice of Belle seems to have been declined quite a bit).
The ""villain"" is the girls' governess, with no really frightening scenes (such as the ones in Sleeping Beauty or Belle's Enchanted Christmas) so it's perfect for kids, while still having a little opposition from the other side.

I love everything about Ariel and her friends, so when I heard another movie was coming I was thrilled. And as a HUGE fan I thought the movie was great. There were only a few issues. The first of which was of course the music. The few songs that were original were great such as Athena's Song, I Remember, and I Will Sing, however they should've been longer. There were other opportunities for original music that I wish the creators would have pursued.

That being said everything else was wonderful...i wish it would've been longer and that the creators would've decided to bring Ursula back like they intended but Marina was entertaining to watch. I also wish they hadn't changed the way Ariel and Flounder met as it contradicts the TV series (which really should be released on DVD as well as the Aladdin TV series).

This movie answers those questions.  One reviewer said the accidental death of Ariel's mom was not for kids.  I guess that means The Lion King, Bambi, and Snow White where intended and plotted murder transpires, aren't for kids either then!

My now 4 year old is satisfied that she understands the story better and how Flounder became her best friend as well.  She's watched it 3 x times in two days since we got it, so I call it a kiddie hit.
Also the movie features the obedient but vainly shallow other 6 sisters; one can understand how curious and intelligent Ariel, the last daughter and more resembling her mother than the other children, just doesn't really fit in to their sorority.  They tell her she ""just doesn't know when to stop"".  It's no wonder she sought a better life on land.

The only out of place character is Benjamin (what is he a manatee?) the sidekick to Marina, the Ursula-lookalike governess to the 7 mermaid princesses.

3243512,2,B000XUOIQO,"[SPOILERS!!]

Assuming that we take the character portrayals in the original as being correct, Flounder and Sebastian have been very altered in this film, particularly Flounder in that he is not the shy, mostly fearful (but brave if he really needs to be) ""guppy"" of the first film.  Marina is a weak villainess - an administrator and clothes horse who wants a more important job.  Benjamin is...I don't know, the Jar-Jar Binks of the film, in an unecessary attempt at comedy relief?  Some music is unoriginal, and the original music uninspired, which is unfortunate given the original talents and voice that did carry into this new film.
Several songs and Marina's costume changes in particular were completely anachronistic.
The one element that I DID enjoy (and allows me to give 2 stars) is the establishing of Ariel's sisters as actual characters, even if they did not get enough screen time.  It was good to see individual personalities and voices among them, rather than just have them as background.

Now, our children (daughter 5, son 8) enjoyed it well enough, but while The Little Mermaid is one of our daughter's favorites of all time (and is even her bedroom decor), this film did not even hold her attention through the entire story.",1221436800,3,1247,4.886255924170616

I truly enjoyed this movie, yes it wasn't like the original but look at all the Cinderellas they have made, they weren't like the original either. Ariel's beginning was in a way like the movie Footloose, no music or dancing is allowed in the city of Atlantis because King Tritain is heartbroken. But as always, the movie has a happy ending that leaves you feeling satisfyed that all is well. As well as being introduced to Ariel's mother you also learn and see more of Ariel's sisters. I felt that Disney did a good job overall and that I was glad I rented it from work. My little sister also watched it with me and came to the same conclusion.",1220918400,,749,4.514705882352941

One of the things I liked about this movie is that most of the original voice cast from the first movie returned for this one. Also, I have to admit I was surprised to find out that Sally Field was the voice of the ""villain"" in this movie.
The overall storyline is not bad for a Disney sequel: Ariel's mother died after being crushed by a ship. After that, King Triton banned all music from Atlantica. Of course, when Ariel is older she tries to change this and goes against her father.
There were some parts of the movie which weren't enjoyable. The music was a little bit corny and it just didn't match the first film. Also, compared to the villains from the first 2 movies, Marina del Rey just didn't cut it.",1220918400,,795,4.414965986394558

The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning also explains why King Triton didn't want Ariel (and the other citizens of his kingdom) to go up to the surface in the original movie and how Sebastian became the court composer.

But, compared to other Disney theatrical releases this one is terrible. The animation is fine, but the writing is bad and the music isn't anything special. Also, there are any number of scenes/actions in the movie that I don't want my daughter emulating.

The best part of the movie is the credits (they're animated and set to music in the Monsters Inc. style).  The movie seemed promising when I read about it and pre-ordered it months ago, but it sure did fall short. As others have noted, bonus features do nothing to improve this movie purchase.",1220659200,2,705,4.632

Disney is famous for killing off a parent, but they do it within two minutes of the movie. What used to be a touching moment in their animated classics, is now a cheap gimmick which disturbed my kids.

The animation quality is okay, but you can really tell they are taking shortcuts.

But most important is the storyline... I can't understand why they didn't work a little harder on a story that held a child's interest. My twin girls were so looking forward to this, and within twenty minutes they were squirming on the couch and looking for toys to play with.

Just a big disappointment. Disney should spend as much time creating the DVD as they do on marketing it.",1220659200,6,940,4.47953216374269

My 3.5 yr old watched this in tears on the way to ""the happiest place on earth"" and after meeting Mickey, Minnie and Goofy, still had nightmares about mommy dying.  Who the hell decided this was a good subject for a kids movie?",1220313600,5,264,4.36734693877551
3243540,4,B000XUOIQO,"This is a big summer for me, because my two tippy-top favorite Disney girls, Ariel and Tink (despite the fact that I really go for the Alice and Wendy performers the most at the theme parks), are getting very special DVD releases; direct-to-video prequels, to be specific. The first is out now, sometimes referred to as The Little Mermaid 3, but released as ""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"".

The plot of this all new, thankfully traditionally animated feature (unlike the upcoming Tinker Bell CGI movie, though that one still looks good), involves King Triton's tragic loss of Ariel's mother, Queen Athena (And yes, we do see Athena in the film, and she looks more like Ariel than one would probably have imagined), and the way the entire kingdom is soon forced to suffer as he does. King Triton places a ban on all music in the kingdom of Atlantica, because music reminds him of his lost beloved, and this results in ten years of boredom and misery for Triton's subjects and his own seven lovely daughters. After that flashback, narrated by Sebastian the crab, we catch up with Triton and his family sometime during Ariel's fifteenth year, when an encounter with a new fish friend named Flounder leads her to discover a secret, underground club in which music is played and celebrated nightly. Ariel's curious and excitable sisters soon join her on her visits to the secret club, and this is their undoing. For their governess, the scheming Marina Del Ray, is out to get Sebastian's job, and that means she's out to get Sebastian, who just happens to be the illegal, musical nightclub proprietor and head entertainer. It's a rather simple plot about how music was brought back to the kingdom of Atlantica, which isn't a spoiler if you've seen the original film at all, with a mild villain thrown in for a little danger. Marina does turn out to be a threat, but the real hurdle for the heroes in the film is Triton and his anti-music agenda.

""The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"" is definitely a film that walks the line of great and disappointing probably more than any Disney sequel. It's beautifully animated for the most part, with my only real complaint being a few scenes of some significant music box figures done in CGI that looks unfinished in close-ups. The plot is not too shabby, but probably too simple to meet most adult viewers' hopes and expectations (yes, there are tons of adult Disney fanatics out there, like myself). Disney tends to aim its direct-to-video films more squarely at kids than its usually MUCH better bigscreen outings or even its animated TV shows. I consider this to be part of the problem with Disney's line of direct to video releases. Also, the villain of a Disney film is often the best aspect for most folks, and in this case, Sally Field's Marina Del Ray is a good character played beautifully, but not all that important as a villain and certainly not very imposing. She has a creepy pack of electric eels to increase her danger quotient though. Of course, she also has a comedic sidekick, a manatee named Benjamin (who seems to not require much oxygen), who I found a bit annoying really but others seem to enjoy.

The biggest problem with the story and the film itself though, for hardcore Little Mermaid fans anyway, is probably that it is hard to buy as a precursor to the original, classic Disney masterpiece. And don't get me started on how annoying it is that the direct-to-video prequel and sequel present Ariel's life as having 10 years of misery and deprivation in her childhood years and ten years of misery and deprivation at the start of her marriage. I know Anderson's mermaid was a tragic character, but this is the most internationally beloved Disney princess of them all! That's beside the point though. As I was saying, it is a bit hard to buy these events as having led up to the original film, and I consider the Disney animated TV series, which I suppose is no longer considered canon (though it is to me), to be a much better prequelization. Something that increases that feeling is the problem ""Ariel's Beginning"" had with character continuity. First, there's the issue of voices, most noticeably, King Triton's (though Ariel's sisters sound totally different from in the theatrical film too). Jim Cummings has taken over as the voice of King Triton after years of Kenneth Mars playing the role. Now, Jim Cummings is a Disney treasure, but he doesn't sound like Triton much at all, and it just doesn't work for me. In fact, of the two biggest complaints I've read about the characterizations in ""Ariel's Beginning"", that's one of them. The other is the character of Flounder. He is a completely different character in this film. Flounder, the cowardly ""guppy"" of the classic film and TV series, is presented here as a Baloo/King Louie wannabe with a rebellious streak. The saddest part is that the one scene in which he really acts just like the original Flounder can be found in the deleted scenes section.

But let's talk about chicks, man. Specifically, Ariel, the girl of my dreams, and her six hottie sisters. Ariel is voiced perfectly here by her original voice actress, Jodi Benson, whose voice is still straight from Heaven. And, thankfully, Ariel is totally in character in this movie. Her sisters finally get some decent screen time too, and I gotta tell ya, the exposure we get to Ariel's sisters here is one of the biggest strong points of ""Ariel's Beginning"". I came away from it absolutely adoring Arista.

Not a hot female, but also reprising his role perfectly here is the great Samuel E. Wright, who voices Sebastian the crab. Mr. Wright actually performs the most memorable song in the film, which unfortunately is not one of the new, original songs written for the film, but instead is the well-known ""Jump in the Line"". This song is performed twice in the film in two different ways, and it's the best musical aspect aside from Ariel singing ""I Remember"". Sadly, the original songs here are not very memorable. This is usually a problem with direct-to-video animated films that attempt to be musicals, and a prime example of a mistake frequently made is the villain's song here, ""Just One Mistake"", which attempts to emulate the song sang by Ursula in the first film but instead is just all over the place and fails to establish a catchy tune.

So, when all is said and done, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is a visually impressive, mildly entertaining new story about Ariel and her friends that unfortunately holds to very little character/story continuity and feels more like it takes place in a parallel universe rather than in the same one as the original film (and totally, disappointingly disregards the TV series; I hate it when they do that!). Honestly, though I still need to rewatch and review it (haven't seen it in a while), I'd be just as comfortable tossing ""The Little Mermaid 2"" into that parallel universe too. I don't care to see Ariel having another 10 years of sadness, nor do I care to see her married to anyone other than me, or with a kid I didn't sire. *ahem*

Folks who simply don't feel we need new stories about the Disney princesses shouldn't bother to watch or review this film, but for those of us who do, we would love to see more if they had this level of visual quality but were just written better. Of course, it is said that this is to be the last of the Disney direct-to-video prequels and sequels (we'll see about that), the Tink movie being more of a Fairy franchise thing like the Barbie DVDs, but the real problem was never the concept of making such films, it was just how much work, heart, talent, and of course money was put into them. ""Bambi 2"", despite the uninspired title, remains the best of the Disney animated sequels (aside from ""Rescuers Down Under"", of course) and is really an outstanding film with only the flaw of some all-too-modern sounding songs. ""Ariel's Beginning"" was one of the ones that came close to that level. Visually, it is beautiful. As a stand alone film, it's pretty good/enjoyable. Good enough for me to give it four stars. It just disregards too much of what has already been established as part of Ariel's universe, and writing down for a younger audience is never really a good thing. If they didn't have to do it for the bigscreen films, why do it for the direct-to-video ones? Is it worth a purchase though? Yes, unless you just hate Disney sequels. It's a good film that looks gorgeous on DVD (it's anamorphic widescreen, by the way). The continuity issues may make you mad, they may not, but it's a good film, and truly the real highlight is getting to know Ariel's sisters better. The DVD includes a couple of deleted scenes, song selections, a short behind-the-scenes featurette with the director, Peggy Holmes, a personality match game (I got Ariel, no cheating!) that is part of a bigger interactive experience that teaches you more about Ariel and her sisters by letting you explore their individual vanities, and the best extra is a behind the scenes look at the new ""The Little Mermaid"" Broadway musical, which I'm DYING to see. A couple of the sisters in that one are cuties too. If you're a fan of Ariel the Little Mermaid, yeah, it's a must purchase. I just so badly wish that Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" TV series would get a complete DVD release too.",1220140800,8,9330,4.713235294117647
3243541,4,B000XUOIQO,"I was extremely skeptical when I first heard about this movie, but was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended. The story is quite charming and it seems like this is one of the first sequels Disney writers gave some thought to.

The basic plot summary actually is that King Triton's kingdom is alive with music until his wife, Athena is killed in an accident. He is overwhelmed by grief and music only exacerbates his pain so he bans music forever. Ariel is still the headstrong girl from the original Little Mermaid movie and is unahppy with the status quo. She meets Flounder and winds up following him to an underground club, who is run by Triton's righthand crab, Sebastian. Ariel's emotions are stirred as she is moved by the music and she begins to remember what it was like before her mother died. She brings her sisters and they are all happy again, until Triton finds out.

What is nice about this movie is that instead of the usual hostile takeover theme to overthrow the king, the villian is actually after Sebastian's job. Marina Del Ray, who is a bit like Ursula without the sorcery, wants to climb the corporate ladder but has little desire to be royalty, an odd departure from the usual fairy tale faire. Her sidekick, Benjamin, who I think is a manatee, is not evil, which is also different. It seems that Disney ditched the formulaic method they have been using to compose their previous subpar sequels and created what Disney was after originally, a charming family movie that you can watch and smile and laugh at over and over again.",1220140800,,1554,4.647272727272727
3243542,4,B000XUOIQO,"My kids love it. I like it. The second Ariel movie was better. (Yes, I loved Return to the Sea.) This has less music, less new music, but it's a fun ride. It also helps explain why Ariel got away with being so stupid and rebellious in the original movie... that lesson was cemented here in the early years. Pout, defy dad, and run away will get what you want in the end! No wonder she tried it again in a few years! But that makes great fodder for conversation with the kids on what she should have done and how she should have done it. We've that that talk plenty after other Disney movies... which is something I happen to like about the Disney movies. My four year old has asked LOTS of questions about death, dying, running away, following rules, sharing etc... all from watching Cars, the Lion King, and the numerous princess movies.
This movie seems to lack some intangible magic that the first two Little Mermaids have, but I can't identify it,. But for kids yearning for more Ariel, this fits the bill!",1220140800,,1010,4.406417112299465
3243553,1,B000XUOIQO,"If you liked the part in Bambi where his mom died, you'll love this movie!  Why are so many Disney movies about the loss of a parent?  There are so few true rated ""G"" movies out there.  My daughter is 4 - too young for this movie - she spent the whole time trying to figure out what happened to the mother, where did she go?  Unlike other reviewers, I liked ""Return to the Sea.""  I thought it was beautiful to see Ariel as a mom.  She is a great one by the way.  Even Ursula's sister tells Ariel's disobedient daughter, ""you should have listened to your mom, kid!""  If you haven't seen that one, you may want to.

Technically called a prequel rather than a sequel as it ""takes place before that of a preexisting work or a sequel"", it does a poor job at that.  Generally a prequel answers questions about the lives of characters in the original story.  These ""characters"" don't even fit.  Why is Flounder such a ""guppy"" in the origional but so brave in the prequel?  Same with Sebastian!  It just doesn't fit.  I also can't believe Ursula and her sister(from Return to the Sea) are never even mentioned.  Most importantly, why does Ariel become so interested in life out of the sea, start her collection, or find her secret cave???  You won't find out in this movie!

If you are looking for a great movie for a young girl, check out the Barbie movies, especially Island Princess, Nutcracker, Rapunzel, and Swan Lake.  They are all much better than this movie.",1220140800,10,1458,4.413533834586466
3243554,1,B000XUOIQO,"... halfway thru this horrid production. I feel sorry for the folks involved ... Jodi Benson and the rest, they did there usual great job, but they had an absolutely AWFUL story to put across. Slow, boring and, I'm sorry, the banning of music from Atlantica is just too high a concept for conflict. Every movie in this vein has GOT to have some evil... Sally Field's ""Marina Del Rey"" character AIN'T it... she's just annoying.

I was also quite disappointed we only got to spend three minutes (if that) with Athena, Triton's lovely redheaded wife. No back story, no chance to care about her...just an odd scene with some hapless pirates and bad weather and she's gone. No tears, nothing... just a ban on music in Atlantica because Triton can't stand to hear 'their song' anymore. No laughs, poor music, and ho-hum 'production' numbers. I DID laugh when Sebastian turned out to be the 'star' of the underground music club.

Disney had a real chance to let us get to know Athena, find out where Ursula and Morgana came from and why they've such an ax to grind with Triton... some back story on Sebastian, maybe... but they squandered it. The original and the 'Return to the Sea' sequel are far better than this direct to the bargain bin by Halloween release.

3243555,1,B000XUOIQO,"Being a child of the 1980s, I have fond memories of The Little Mermaid. It was fun, great music, an epic movie of sorts. Looking at the reviews from others and based on what I viewed, we must have seen completely different films because ""The Little Mermaid- Ariel's Beginning"" was outright dull, boring and horrific. I know, I'm probably not the target audience but even my younger sister said this movie wasn't anything like the first one and even the dreadful second movie which was, like this, a direct-to-dvd release.

Basically, ""Ariel's Beginning"" is The Little Mermaid mixed with ""Footloose"". It's forbidden to sing or make music in Atlantis, the kingdom ruled by Ariel's father. But alas, Ariel and company decide to take on the crown and dare to dance and spread the love of music throughout the kingdom! Yet, here's the problem- for a movie about embracing music, the actual music in the film was absolutely horrendous. This franchise, to me, is founded upon music and good songs. Even the second film had a spread of musical numbers but this? No. The few musical numbers are simply horrible and uninspired if even listenable. They even perform one song, best known from being the song featured in the final scene of 'Beetlejuice' a whopping THREE times in the film! Talk about unoriginal.

What a butchering of a great franchise. So what, it's animated. Big whoop, there's nothing groundbreaking about it. Even my younger sister said this, when stacked against the other films, was by far the worse. I wouldn't waste my money on this boring, dull, uninspired drivel. Save it and put it towards the two-disc special release of the first film - it'd be much better spent and used.",1219968000,21,1689,4.820689655172414
3243556,5,B000XUOIQO,"""Ariel's Beginning"" is a fun animated feature that had my 3.5 year old daughter asking for more. The story is the prequel to The Little Mermaid - it tells the story of how King Triton lost his beloved wife Athena in an accident [back when Ariel and her sisters were little] and thus banned music and all forms of gaiety in his kingdom, living in seclusion and with darkness within his heart. When the pirncesses grow up, they all chafe against the restrictions imposed by King Triton, especially Ariel who, like her mother, loves music and singing. Ariel starts to dabble in music secretly, much to her father's anger and finally runs away with Sebastian in tow, until Triton realises his folly.

It is in this movie that we find out how Ariel meets and befriends Flounder, and how Sebastian becomes the music conductor in Triton's court. There is also a villain in the form of nanny, Marina del Rey, though she is not as scary or menacing as Ursula, the sea witch in The Little Mermaid.

Ok, it is not as enchanting as The Little Mermaid, but all in all, I thought it was a decent effort by Disney, considering some of the other animated features out there.

The songs in this feature are not as catchy as in The Little Mermaid, but they are still pleasing and fun. The songs here are: I Remember, I Will Sing, Athena's Song,Just One Mistake,Jump In The Line [Shake, Senora], and  Man Smart, Woman Smarter.

The extras include Deleted Scenes, Music and More [the Disney Song Selection option allows the words of the songs to appear on screen, making it easy for sing-alongs], Games and Activities [Mermaid Discovery Vanity Game- allows viewers to unearth secrets about the princesses by clicking on their personal scrapbooks, or compare which of King Triton's daughters you are most like with the Personality Profile Game]. There is also a Backstage Disney feature [a behind the scenes featurette centring on  animation director Peggy Holmes].

I watched this with my little one, and we were both entertained - so much so that we watched it again! Having been long-time Little Mermaid fans [me longer than my little one of course:)], this was a delightful addition to our collection of Disney features.",1219968000,22,2203,4.7513089005235605

This one was not as action packed as the first thats true and I do believe the storyline could've been a little more devloped but all in all it was worth my money and time. It was deffenetly better then cinderellaI II which was a complete waste in my opinion because it had absolutely no relevence to the first Cinderella, whareas this movie I think gives a nice tie in to the others.

It also clears up why King Triton was so upset with Ariel going to the surface in the original,since his wife died with a pirates ship.
Nice movie and was better than the Return to the sea movie,nice music,a little childish at times but it is a movie for kids.

3243559,4,B000XUOIQO,"Upon watching this movie, I was actually pretty impressed! Like some others have said, the story is pretty basic, nothing too intricate or complicated about it. I did enjoy the opening where it tells the story of Ariel's mother. I also thought, in general, that this movie had wonderful animation! It's far superior to all of the other straight to DVD Disney sequels/prequels, and dare I say the animation may be better than the ORIGINAL. Although the original is a good, what...20 years old now? I still thought they did an excellent job with the movie overall. My 2 year old loves the Little Mermaid, and I'm glad I got it for her. :)",1219795200,,636,4.587719298245614
3243560,3,B000XUOIQO,"My daughter absolutely LOVES Ariel and both Little Mermaid 1 & 2 so I figured this movie would be, at the very least, entertaining for her.  While she did sit through it the 1st time, when I offered to let her watch it again, she agreed but it didn't hold her interest enough for her to watch it all again (and she has seen the other 2 movies many times each!)  It just didn't hold her (or my) attention very well.  The annimation, as others have said, IS very good - nothing close to the crappy TV show so no worries about that.  The background we get about Ariel's mother is nice, albeit VERY brief...the whole movie is based on the premise that her mother was so into music that her tragic death upsets Triton so much he can't bear to have music in Atlantica anymore.  But all we get is ONE very short scene of her singing to her 7 daughters as the are put to bed.  And then yeah, we get to see Ariel's look-alike mother making out w/Triton, which IS a little creepy.  Still, you get that they really loved each other but seeing as the whole storyline is based on her love of music, I just wish we had seen more.  More scenes of the mother w/Ariel.  Maybe some mention of the fact that Ariel and her mother look exactly alike - what does that do to Triton...is this what keeps him so protective of her?  The background on the other characters is cute (Sebastian and Flounder) and the scenes at the secret nightclub are cute too but overall, the music is pretty terrible.  Most notably, the 1st song by Sally Field is pretty unbearable.  It's mainly spoken, and not musically.  Even a Jodie Benson song (can't recall the exact name) is pretty bad, which is saying a lot.  I was pretty excited about the music when I saw the short preview (which is the 1st scene in the movie, w/her mother singing her to sleep) but after this, it pretty much disappoints - sometimes badly.  The sidekick to the villianess IS out of place, although I found him to at least provide some comic relief.  As for the extras, we really only enjoyed the behind the scenes look at the Broadway show.  The pencil drawing ""deleted scenes"" were not interesting (especially to a 4 year old!) and we couldn't get through the behind the scenes look w/the director - just didn't hold our interest.  I liked that they provided the songs in their own feature, until we listened to them again and only found ourselves liking the 1st (mothers's lullaby).  To rewatch that Sally Field song was torture!  I would have so much preferred a movie where maybe Ariel relays her childhood to her daughter, or maybe even grandaughter.  Or possibly has more intimate memories of her mother.  Or even just a movie w/her CHILDhood, not necessarily her teen years.  I'd say I was most pleased with the fact that the villian doesn't actually get slayed in the end, which is a bit of a switch (although for that song, she should have been!)  So, while it will certainly do for little fans of Ariel (can they ever get enough of her?) it just doesn't make the grade.",1219795200,,3014,4.4086799276672695

But I must say that Ariel's Beginning was very well done.  The animation was great!  You could tell that they actually put some effort into it, and as far as the plot, not exactly original or thought provoking, but I wasn't bored; it was decent.  I laughed quite a few times, mostly because of the Yzma-like Villain and her very strange henchman, and a frantic octopus.

3243564,2,B000XUOIQO,"If you wanted to know what happened to Ariel's mother, the first 5min of this movie will tell you. After that, the movie is a complete waste of time with some pretty terrible music.

Jodi Benson's voice is great as usual. But they give her horrible material to sing to. Why can't they get decent song writers at Disney anymore?

The movie would have been a million times better if it featured Ursula and why she was banished from the kingdom. Instead, we get some new sucky villain who sings sucky songs and has a bizarre relationship with a green monster who looks like it had been playing in nuclear waste.

Ariel's mother strangely is an exact replica of Ariel. Which means, while Triton is romantic with her, it looks like he's getting it on with his daughter. Which is pretty creepy.

The movie begins okay, laughter, happiness, but then it takes a turn for the worst; first of all, King Triton would never ban music (the whole kingdom must have hated him AND he made his daughters sad (which he would try to avoid at any cost since he loves them)). There is NO character development (and Ariel is only little in the beginning, so I was hugely disapointed when she was 14-15 through out the movie), Flounder is SHY (and in the disney-series Ariel and flounder go way back, not just a year or two) and he shouldn't be so strait forward as he is in this movie. There's 1 original song in this movie, the rest is bad covers of already known hits! Please, The little Mermaid won Oscars for the music! This only proves that Disney should not make sequals to already great movies! And where did Ursula go? She clearly said in the first movie that she'd lived in the palace, was that *15* yrs earlier, before Ariel was born?

And that purple haired mermaid, in her song they showed her wearing train clothes and other outfits that probably didn't exist during The little mermaid, same goes for her military clotes (Disney, come on, don't mix up the time line!)

3243567,4,B000XUOIQO,"Ever since Disney's ""sequels"" department has been under new management, there has been a HUGE upgrade in quality. There have only been two animated releases so far, Cinderella III and The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning. I am not sure if any more sequels are in production.

Consistent between both films is the very high quality animation. TLM:AB keeps CGI to a minimum and much effort has been made to keep the characters close to the original character models (and in many cases, character models have heavily improved over the original). This is probably as good as it will get without the original team of animators.

What saves this film is the fantastic hand-drawn animation in the age of ugly CGI and lazy flash-drawn cartoons. I would go as far as to say that the animation here is on-par or higher than the original 1989 release (the original was plagued with off-model animation). Unfortunately, the story is only so-so. The plot is very weak but effort has been made to develop all of the sisters' personalities, which I really appreciate (they are believable sister to sister relationships). I think Disney recognised that without Alan Menken, the music for TLM would not have charm or beauty. Disney did the right thing for this film by keeping songs short and to a minimum.

This film highly deserves a chance to be seen by many, unlike the rushed and horrible Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.",1219795200,4,1415,4.814814814814815

I'm giving this one 5 stars because its a great sequal. Maybe 4 stars if it were something I went to see at the movies.  I was doubtful that this movie would be anything more than 90 minutes of poor-quality animation with a weak story line and annoying songs, given that this is what Disney sequals have amounted to over the years. Fortunately, this movie is different than those other disappointing sequals. The first thing I noticed was how much nicer the animation is in this movie than in previous Disney sequals. The animation stays fairly true to the original Little Mermaid movie and doesn't look like a series of computer coloring page!  Not only that but the storyline is really very sweet. (my daughters were really turned off by the first sequal that showed Arieal growing up and becoming a mother...gross)  I think this movie does a nice job of adding some depth to the original story. As a mother of teenage daughters who grew up with Disney Princesses, this is a nice addition to our collection. I hope that Disney continues to release more quality movies like this one instead of just throwing things together quickly to capitalize on the demand for all things princess.",1219708800,8,1278,4.696428571428571

The only things this movie tells us is exactly why triton is the way he is in the first movie and what happened to ariels mother.

I think it would have made more sense to base the thrid movie after the events of the second. Like have Morgana come back, after she was never killed only frozen, it's possible. I mean why leave an opened ending like that and then make perquel to the first instead? I doesn't make any sense to me. This movie diffinatly needed a better plot.

I just finished watching this new Little Mermaid and I am sad to say it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for. This movie is suppoused to be all about music in Atlantic and Ariels mother so I had hoped there would be some really great songs on here but there just wasnt. The song that her Mother Athena sings she only sung for like 4-5 lines long it wasn't even a whole song which was disappointing cause it just sounded like it would have been a very good one had it been alot longer. Also Triton and Ariels song they don't even really sing its more some words of the song was said then anything and a little music. The song Ariel sings in the underground club ""I Remember"" was Good but it of course wouldnt be a favorite like ""Part of Your World"" For a review I read previously on how someone hoped for a song with the sisters, sorry to disappoint but they don't sing at all although they talk and are involved so much more in this one which was a plus for me. I guess I just expected too much for this movie it just seemed so good from the trailers which they showed about all the good parts there are anyway. There was an excellent time I thought in there for Ariel to sing a great song when she finds the music box and remembers more of her mother but to a great disappointment to me there wasnt. So to narrow it all down I loved that the sisters were more involved and talking but my biggest disappoint me was there just wasn't any Great Songs on there except the ones you don't even hear much of so that makes it pointless to listen to. Maybe they will come out with a soundtrack and it will have the whole song on there it would be great if they did but the movie just disappointed me. I DID love it because I love the Little Mermaid but it was just disappointing.",1219708800,,1901,4.031746031746032
3243572,4,B000XUOIQO,"I was totally expecting another disaster, like ""Return to the sea"". Ugh! That movie was a true agony to sit through! The story of return to the sea wasn't at all bad (it really had potential to make a good movie) but the animation was horrible and so were the songs. I couldn't stand it! That's why I was so pleasantly surprised by ""Ariel's Beginning"". It had a few good songs and some nice remakes of some old songs that I heard Harry Belafonte sing a LONG time ago. It also has a rather good story and the animation is nearly as good as the original movie. That's kind of sad because with all the CGI tools available these days, they should have been able to surpass animation of the original movie.
Now for the ultimate compliment. I've seen the move and liked it so much that I'm ordering the DVD. I want to see the extras and hear the commentary, plus buying the DVD is the only way I have to tip the people who created it. It's the only way I can compliment their work, and this work deserves recognition.
I'm very lucky. I've only become a little mermaid fan about a month ago. While everyone else had to wait decades for this prequel, I only had to wait a couple weeks. How lucky is that!?",1219622400,2,1197,4.254385964912281
3243583,5,B000XUOIQO,"I do not know why any one would give it a bad review.  However, since childhood I have always liked the little mermaid, and whether or not this movie is great, I am counting the days till this movie comes out on DVD so that I can share that precious moment with my own little one who now loves the little mermaid as much as I did, and still do.  Give it a chance; Ariel always shines.",1219449600,2,384,3.9740259740259742
3243584,4,B000XUOIQO,"I'm not sure why a number of people have chosen to review or bash a movie that they've never seen, but I for one found this movie to be very well done. Is it worthy of a big screen release? Not necessarily; it is a low-key story, but nonetheless, a VAST improvement over some of Disney's previous direct-to-dvd movies. The story is a prequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000F8O35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>,"" and explains how King Triton banned music in his kingdom when his wife was killed. We learn how Sebastian became the music conductor for King Triton, and how Ariel & Flounder met. Naturally, it is the full-of-life Ariel who helps bring music back to her father's life. Although the villain is not as fun and nasty as the legendary Ursula, Marina Del Rey (ably voiced by Sally Field) is plenty of fun as the evil governess for King Triton's daughter. Not content to be a governess, she plots to usurp Sebastian's position, even if it means getting rid of Ariel. The one odd character in the movie is Marina's sidekick, Benjamin. His style of animation looks like something out of Barney. It is particularly jarring since the animation on this film is SOOOO good! It does not look like your typical straight-to-dvd release; in fact, I would go so far as to say that it is on par with the original feature. Jodi Benson returns as the voice of Ariel. In both singing and acting, she is fantastic and totally believeable as the songstress under the sea. As Sebastian, Samuel E. Wright returns...who else could voice this classic animated character? There are seven musical numbers in the film, and the fact that it was directed by a choreographer (Peggy Holmes) is a plus. The movement of the characters in the film AND the dance numbers is fantastic.

Extras are also great. 2 backstage Disney featurettes: ""Splashdance"" is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, hosted by director Peggy Holmes. ""The Little Mermaid: Under the Sea and Behind The Scenes On Broadway"" gives a backstage look at the Broadway musical production, featuring interviews with the cast. There are 2 deleted scenes (shown in storyboard form), ""Music & More"" (where viewers can directly access the musical numbers AND watch them karaoke-style with the words on the screen), and the game ""Mermaid Discovery Vanity Game,"" where you can learn about each of King Triton's daughters by clicking on the personal items on their vanity/makeup tables.

Overall, a wonderful DVD for children of all ages. Definitely a quality production!",1218931200,77,2664,5.178654292343388
3243585,5,B000XUOIQO,"Lets get real.  Who cares about plot, villians, etc.  Isn't this little movie about kids?  I know that my daughter will LOVE this flick.  If your daughter has one piece of Ariel stuff...get this for her.  She'll love it.",1218931200,4,220,4.538461538461538

I read it, and after seeing the trailers for the movie, I'm positive that Disney has just adapted the book into another sequel movie.

I loved both The Little Mermaid and Footloose movies, but I'm just thinking, ""where is the originality Disney? Come on.""",1216598400,2,305,4.350877192982456
3243589,5,B000XUOIQO,"I don't see how anyone could not like LM2 ... Melody is a compelling character, you can see how she got hit with the double dose of adventurous spirit that goads her on to trouble & her destiny.  And Tara Strong's vocal performance in ""For A Moment"" is so beautiful it makes me cry.  She manages to hold her own alongside Jodi Benson and her voice stands out without drowning out Jodi.  I look forward to her work in this new story as well.
Most Disney gets a few tears out of me, because it's so good at strumming the heart strings.  I agree there's a lot of things that have happened at the corporate level of the company (especially in the parks) that Walt wouldn't agree with, but there are many creative individuals working there who keep an ember of his magic burning ... don't dis the magic, people.",1214956800,5,806,4.3533333333333335

If they're going to do a movie, why not have a decent story?  A proper villain?  A plot?  Tension?  Not some watered down pansy 4-year-old drivel with a moral that bashes you over the head.
