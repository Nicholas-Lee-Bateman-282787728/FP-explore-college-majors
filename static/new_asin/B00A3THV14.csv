8546540,5,B00A3THV14,This is an excellent documentary that explores assisted suicide and what happens when physician assisted suicide is illegal. Fascinating and insightful.,1442016000,,152,6.285714285714286
8546541,4,B00A3THV14,"Although exit should be based on medical evidence since medical field is an evidence balanced field unfortunately it happens to be otherwise since criminal justice politics is huge in many states in US.

Years ago when I was very young and no one would consider discussing exit which I did and wrote my Health Care Directive, it was amazing to me that many found my behavior out of ordinary. Latest surveys show that when individuals who wanted to exit something like 70% backed out of it the last minute. The same percentage was also true for individuals who faced death and did not want to leave this planet regardless if living meant more suffering and more pain. The same percentage was even true for individuals who wanted to live even if disable and bound in an emergency room with all the discomforts instead of exiting. Decades after writing my HCD, majority of the individuals that I know still will shy away from this issue. Religions as well as big pharma have their opinion as well which certainly discourages anyone in addressing exit regardless. As a proud future organ donor, with a healthy diet and healthy mind, without any chronic condition, not only I have my HCD but my POLST as well, even a copy in my car's dashboard. This documentary is the story of hidden world of assisted suicide. This documentary is about Final Exit organization not about exactly what individuals who really want to exit. How to Die in Oregon documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-To-Die-In-Oregon/dp/B007Y3666S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How To Die In Oregon</a>&nbsp;is about real sick individuals who can not exit even if they wanted to exit due to their physical condition. Death is a pretty sharp dividing line and a polarizing subject which will never change either. This is a complex issue and will even be more complex when one becomes either mentally or physically disable and has never addressed this issue previously.",1394755200,2,1976,5.175
8546542,5,B00A3THV14,"Frontline did a thorough documentary on a subject rarely explored, assistance in dying. I was partly involved in some of the scenes and know how carefully the filming was done. At first viewing I was embarrassed and angry at how the Final Exit Network was portrayed. Since then the Network had an extremely sick patient who gratefully was able to use our services having seen the documentary on TV. When viewed again I had to say that it was well presented and courageous and informed audiences about their choices in a compassionate, objective way.",1389916800,,549,4.851063829787234
8546543,5,B00A3THV14,"I just purchased this documentary a week ago and also have seen it from my public library. I have been studying euthanasia
and medical assisted suicide for sometime now. Frontline gives excellent documentaries on various types of subjects such as
these. I have stage 4 kidney cancer in both kidneys and severe cardiomyopathy with a tumor on my heart and weakened lungs.
I was diagnosed with cancer in Jan. 2010 and the only states that allow assisted medical sucide is the states of Oregon and
Washington all other states within the U.S. look at euthanasia and assisted sucide as ""murder"". This is an excellent documentary
for the terminally ill and the loved one whom have to be care givers. It helps you understand what terminally ill patients are
going thru while on hospise care and pallative comfort care. You will see some of the patients and their loved ones whom are
caregivers coping with death and the terminally ill of their loved ones. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this video
because it is heart breaking. But death is very much a part of life. This documentary is excellent and well worth watching. May
God bless you and keep you in His Grace and strengthen you as you go thru the end of life decisions. Mrs. D.L.WC. 9/17/13",1379376000,,1251,4.665158371040724
8546544,5,B00A3THV14,"When is it mercy, when is it murder, to have assisted dying?  Is the Oregon law an ethical choice for those in excruciating pain at the end of life or does it rob the person of redemptive suffering?  Is it playing God to refuse help to someone begging for mercy or it is playing God to thwart death by continued medical treatment via machine or other extended efforts.  This program examines both sides of the issue in an objective and equal presentation.  An excellent effort in a time when society deals with the advances of medical care and the sense that sense is a failure.",1372982400,,578,4.476190476190476
8546545,4,B00A3THV14,"Great video for leading discussion around the whole ""assisted suicide"" conversation. As usual, Frontline breaks it down and keeps it interesting, using real-life cases amidst the facts and figures.",1372204800,,197,5.827586206896552
8546546,5,B00A3THV14,"This is well done and informative.  If you don't want to feel helpless at the end of your life and you want a painless way out, watch this.",1365465600,2,139,3.9642857142857144
