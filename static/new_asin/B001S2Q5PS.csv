I am glad it was video and I did not pay $10 to see it in a movie house I would have been mad",1384300800,,143,3.235294117647059
3783167,1,B001S2Q5PS,"I didn't like this movie AT ALL!!!!!  From the beginning to the middle was bad, I can't speak of the ending because after a short period of time AI just couldn't take it anymore.  Waist of time, money and brain power looking at this stupid movie.",1368144000,,246,4.326086956521739
3783168,5,B001S2Q5PS,"Our little ones enjoyed this short but sweet account of a slave girl fighting for freedom.
I is a great show to watch with little ones trying to grasp the concept of slavery.",1361145600,2,174,4.303030303030303
3783169,3,B001S2Q5PS,"Not as historically rich as I expected. The movie did not expand enough on the lesson, so a little disappointed.",1357084800,2,112,4.65
3783170,3,B001S2Q5PS,"I choose this rating cause it was an ok movie...thats all.  It wasn't totally bad, just kind of expected more, watch it yourself, maybe you'll get more from it than i did.",1354060800,,171,4.34375
3783171,3,B001S2Q5PS,This video gives a good description of a very peril time in American History.  I would love to see more to make a better opinion.  Great Information which could be shared with Middle School and High School students.,1353888000,,215,4.631578947368421
3783172,3,B001S2Q5PS,"This was an story about a young black woman who yearns for freedom from slavery. She thinks she is getting what she dreams for when a preacher buys her and takes her west only to find she is still a slave.  It was a rather low budget film and at times seemed to move slowly.  Unfortunately, I found myself getting bored with the story.  I was substitute teaching a class when we selected this video to watch.  If I would have been watching it on my own I would have shut it off.  The kids were just glad they didn't have any school work to do for the day.",1352160000,6,555,4.055045871559633

3783175,3,B001S2Q5PS,"Nice story for children, they wouldn't notice that the acting is bad. The plot is simple enough for children and it is a very short movie. But as an adult it is hard for me to watch.",1411948800,,182,3.945945945945946
3783176,3,B001S2Q5PS,"It was a good ""Little House on the Prairie"" type story. I was looking more for a documentary.",1408406400,,93,4.222222222222222
3783177,1,B001S2Q5PS,"bad acting, lame story. save your money. also shouldn't be categorized as a movie since it is only 40 minutes long. not believable and NOT enjoyable.",1403136000,,149,4.769230769230769
3783178,2,B001S2Q5PS,"Too short, plot could have been developed more.  The historical background was good.  The picture appeared realistic, you don't see many movies about blacks in that part of the country.",1400284800,,185,5.133333333333334
3783179,5,B001S2Q5PS,"I watch PBS all the time, but missed this one.  Thank you for having it. My family love to watch it.",1392595200,,100,3.761904761904762
3783180,3,B001S2Q5PS,"No where is there any (real) history lesson?  If you are going to spend the money on a movie and it is limited (money) well at least spend it on a little history lesson.  This movie was poorly made and history was slanted.  Sorry, I was not thinking this was an OSCAR in the making it was just a lazy movie with long boring acts.  The reason for the 3 stars, is for effort sort of?",1392508800,,381,3.973684210526316
3783181,1,B001S2Q5PS,Happy Slaves.  I don't think so.  Hollywood's view of slavery.  I am tired of the lies. Stop Stop Stop Please,1389830400,12,109,4.35
3783182,4,B001S2Q5PS,"it was alright, but a little boring.  Although it showed some insight into life at that time, it didn't have much action.",1388793600,,121,4.5

8339365,1,B001S2Q5PS,Didn't even bother watching more than 10 minutes of this one.,1464739200,,61,4.636363636363637
8339366,3,B001S2Q5PS,I like the native and african american storyline. Characters not fleshed out enough for me. Good film to show young people if you explain historic facts etc. Liked that one black character was free and the other enslaved. This did happen. Film should've showed Martha and her fiance settling in an all black town on the prairie...this happened as well. See Allensworth in Califonia.,1453593600,,382,4.984375

8339370,3,B001S2Q5PS,it wasn't what I thought it would be,1430956800,,36,3.625
8339371,5,B001S2Q5PS,"Having once lived in the area where this story takes place...Kansas...and knowing something of Kansas history,  I have to say this is historically pretty accurate and portrays what may have happened back then.  I looked up Martha online and found a bill of sale for her in 1856 I believe,  so this story is on target.  Could have been longer.  And will better actors.  But was very interesting if you know Kansas history.",1426464000,,421,4.698630136986301
8339372,3,B001S2Q5PS,Not a bad movie mediocre,1419292800,,24,4.0
