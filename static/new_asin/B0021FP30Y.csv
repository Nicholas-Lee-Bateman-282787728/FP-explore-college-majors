3838963,5,B0021FP30Y,Entertaining video with a combination of familiar Thomas and Friends songs - most are very charming and entertaining for my 2 year old grandson - and short stories. He likes to watch this video to help him relax when it's nap time.,1362441600,,231,4.523809523809524
3838964,5,B0021FP30Y,This is a collection of songs from the early years of thomas and friends when the show largely un-animated.  The best part is that it is largely episodes of songs.  The baby loves this!,1361750400,,185,4.411764705882353
3838965,3,B0021FP30Y,"Every Thomas video we have has at least one repackaged episode. While annoying for me ad an adult, my three-year old doesn't mind at all. I can't complain too much as the subject matter is better for him than many other shows targetting his age group. Thomas and his friends still teach good values like trust, honesty, and hard work, which really need to be instilled in the younger generations. I'll settle for a few repackaged episodes as long as it keeps my son entertained while teaching him to be a decent person.",1332547200,3,519,4.591397849462366
3838966,5,B0021FP30Y,"My 4 year old loves this movie and watches it over and over.  It is the older style one not the one with the ""moving"" faces.  The newer version scares him.  (The moving faces are creepy) so if you have a toddler who prefers the older animation Thomas this is it!  Also the songs are great to keep them occupied in the car or at home.  My son can't get enough of hop on board!",1298419200,2,375,3.9466666666666668
3838967,1,B0021FP30Y,"I was extremely disappointed when I started playing this DVD and realized it's just a repackaged version of the sing-along and stories DVD, which I already had.  How can a company get away with such a thing?  Fortunately I was able to return it.",1259798400,4,245,4.545454545454546
3838968,5,B0021FP30Y,"This isn't your regular garden variety Thomas & Friends. This disc offers two classic Thomas & Friends stories and seven sing-a-long renditions! Also included is a bonus musical CD, so the kids can jam to their favorite Thomas tunes on their own.

Each sing-along song on the DVD features the lyrics on the screen, complete with bouncing steam cloud to keep the beat. When Thomas and his friends are hard at work, they enjoy listening to music and love to sing-along. Now you can offer the same experience to your children (minus the hard work). Kids will love being able to participate as the trains belt out their favorites.

The two traditional episodes are Peter Sam and the Refreshment Lady and Bulldog. Then get ready to sing-along to the Thomas' Anthem, It's Great to Be an Engine, Gone Fishing, Let's Have a Race, Toby, The Island Song and He's a Really Useful Engine. The accompanying music CD includes the last five songs.

The Thomas & Friends animated series is focused on teaching timeless life lessons of discovery, friendship and cooperation. Children are invited to enter a world of imagination through the tracks of a train and the words of a story. Get on board and start singing!",1246406400,6,1198,4.777777777777778
3838969,1,B0021FP30Y,"I am very disappointed with this! I already have the other three music collections from Thomas. My son loves them! When I saw this one as ""not yet released"" available June whatever, I pre-ordered it. It is a complete rip-off! They stuck it in a new box and added a music cd....(which my son thinks is ""broken"" because there is no picture). IT IS THE SAME EXACT DVD AS SING ALONG & STORIES...same title, same songs same stories. What a RIP OFF! Now of course I have opened it to find this out so I am STUCK with it! If I could give it ZERO stars i would....very misleading marketing & packaging.",1245110400,14,594,4.3125

8349249,2,B0021FP30Y,thus video did not keep my son's attention for 30 seconds and he LOVES Thomas. The songs are all slow and boring. Nothing upbeat. Very monotone singing. Save yourself having to get up and turn it off.,1421193600,,200,4.4324324324324325

8349253,1,B0021FP30Y,"It's mostly song videos and not a storyline at all.  I realize it says ""songs"" on the cover but I didn't know it was pretty much totally music.",1398384000,2,143,4.107142857142857
