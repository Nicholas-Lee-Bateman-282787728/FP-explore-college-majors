7930875,5,B000055WDY,"The Chinese have quietly been suffocating Tibet, its people and culture for 60 years.
When China  attacked Tibet in the late forties and HH the Dalai Lama had to flee he wrote letters to the UN, USA and to others and no-one responded.
Where is the outcry ?  Are people not to be bothered ?
Se this  documentary... See it and be heartbroken. This is happening now, this very minute.",1208736000,2,381,4.414285714285715
7930876,4,B000055WDY,"This is a very good one hour film on the life of the Dali Lama and the plight of the Tibetan people since the Chinese take over of Tibet.  It does a wonderful job of providing an overview of the Dali Lama and the situation in Tibet.

Compassion in Exile has excellent photography, a good mixture of historical material and personal vignettes.  It was particularly successful at capturing the personality of the Dali Lama and the energy of his presence which is often characterized by people as extremely authentic, compassionate and even playful.  Certainly, the quality of his presence is a testimony to his development and an affirmation of his historical and spiritual significance.  There is also an excellent book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Happiness-A-Handbook-for-Living/dp/1573221112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living</a>, which is a down to earth portait of the Dali Lama as viewed by a modern day psychiatrist.  This book is also full of stories and quotes of the Dali Lama and is a very accessible introduction.

This movie is also excellent for its inspirational value.  Surely, the Dali Lama embodies the qualities of forgivenss, compassion and peace.  It is very clear from this movie he is in a different category than an ordinary human being and represents the highest attainment of his culture which is rapidly and systematically being destroyed.

One argument for the preservation of Tibetan culture and historical artifacts is that because of their isolation, many rare manuscripts and other important knowledge were preserved for more than a thousand years.  A lot of this knowledge is oral and if the culture is dissemated some of this will be lost.  It can also be effectively argued that Tibetan masters have done the deepest type of introspective work ever undertaken by any culture.  What they have learned is something valuable to the people of this planet as a whole.

While it is a tragedy what happened in Tibet, the presence and visibility of the Dali Lama and the awareness of Tibetan culture on a large scale is a blessing for the rest of the world.  The Dali Lama himself often refers to the Chinese communists as ""his friends, the enemy.""  This sort of equanimity is a wonderful example of the type of understanding and compassion that we all need to reach a worldcentric point of view that will result in peace.  This is of course is dependent upon individual development beyond mere cognition i.e. honoring other intelligences such as emotional, social, etc.

This would make a GREAT classroom video.  If you are interested in knowing more about Tibetan Buddhism, you may also want to check out the listmania lists on my profile.  There are various listed relating to a variety of religius traditions.  However, one book that I feel is the must have for anyone interested in world religions is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-s-Religions-Our-Great-Wisdom-Traditions/dp/0062508113/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions</a>.  This gives a good overview of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, etc.  Another one by the same author that talks about the common core of the world's wisdom traditions and its relation to a scientific and primarily materialistic worldview is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgotten-Truth/dp/0441011179/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgotten Truth</a>.

There are also a number of other DVDs available on Amazon about the Dali Lama.  However, this film by Mickey Lemle with music by Philip Glass is certainly a great first exposure to this fascinating man and his culture.  The Dali Lama is truly a spiritual giant in every sense of the word and his Holiness the Dali Lama is certainly a title that he lives up to in every respect.",1177200000,17,3921,5.558922558922559
7930877,4,B000055WDY,"In the past I have referred to His Holiness the Dalai Lama as simply the 'Dalai Lama', without knowing how vast the name in the man / the man in the name really is. After viewing the DVD, I now use the term His Holiness with its truest and deepest reverential connotation, for I feel so much love exuding from his being that it is really HOLY or GOOD. I thank those who made it possible for us to view such a life. I lovingly thank His Holiness for his life in this lifetime time and in all lifetimes.",1173312000,7,501,4.070707070707071
7930878,5,B000055WDY,"Mickey Lemle's documentary weaves the biography of the 14th Dalai Lama with a summation of the history of the Chinese government's invasion and occupation of Tibet. The stories are fascinating and tightly linked. I was moved by both the Dalai Lama's presence, leadership and vision,  and I was deeply saddened by the genocidal destruction brought on Tibet's people and culture by the Chinese government. The film is extremely well made including, as I understand it, footage smuggled out of Tibet, and excellent interview footage. Highest recommendation.",1118188800,6,554,5.441860465116279
