8646200,2,B00IXQUSQ4,"Although this documentary clearly describes the erosion of our educational model and the ineffectiveness that has resulted from putting more emphasis on testing and less on the actual learning process, I think it misses the boat as to the underlying reason why this has happened and what to do about our nation's declining creativity.  The producer points to the Eisenhower era as the beginning of the federal government's influence in education, then to the Reagan and Bush era (No Child Left Behind) as the root of when the damage to the education system began.  The film features Obama giving several inspirational speeches about education (feel-good language written by a speech writer) while downplaying the fact that Obama, too, signed a continuation of NCLB.  The film champions the federal government's first attempts to exert control on eduction, citing the response to Sputnik that caused a large sum of money to be sunk into education; the film indicates that it was this money that was responsible for our successful mission to the moon.  However, most of the people who had the creativity to put us on the moon were largely educated before federal interference in education.  Yes, the large sum of money may have helped students who already had most of their K-12 education done to have access to expensive technology like the first computers and other equipment that could help them learn the science and engineering necessary, but their creativity was established while they were still children by an education system which still had much local control.  Today, it is the Republican party that is pushing for more local control of education and the Democratic party that is pushing for more federal control.  Not that I think either party has the right answer, but the unneeded political slant the film has is, for this reason, ironic.

The issue is actually non-partisan.  One part of the issue has to do largely with the belief within the education system that every student needs an identical learning experience. I taught a freshman level university science class for one semester, but did not renew my contract because of the attitude coming down from the department heads that all classes need to be standardized--they want each student to have the same experience.  Every person in the world will have unique life experiences, and therein lies the seed for creative societal solutions--the variety of perspectives that come from a variety of life experiences, which a standardized school system seems to aspire to do away with.  A second part of the issue, which the film mentions, is that creativity is inherent in every person when they are born, but we lose that creativity as we progress through the school system--i.e., it is ""taught"" out of us.  The part that I don't think the film quite nails is that it is the brick and mortar, sort people by ages, have common educational goals for everyone, etc. that is sucking the creativity out of people--yes, the system itself, not just whether it has the right balance between content or creativity.  The fact that we ship our kids off to be babysat by a school system for 13 of their most open-minded exploratory years is a tragedy.  If creativity is to flourish, the whole system needs to be done away with and people of all ages should be allowed to come together to inspire and support each other solely because of common interests.  Grades, tests, deadlines, sorting people by age and neighborhood and by GPA into a sort of caste system, etc. do nothing for helping people pursue their passions.  The educational experts interviewed in the film offer some insight into this, but they still seem very married to the education system they probably can't quite fathom thinking outside of.  A system sorted on interests and collaboration rather than the superficial categories we have now will have no need for educational ""experts"".

In short, I feel that the film is a start, but doesn't have quite enough imagination to inspire the kind of changes we need to see in education, and it is somewhat caught up in pointing fingers in a political sense.",1481587200,,4123,4.933526011560693
8646201,4,B00IXQUSQ4,"This film points out some important aspects of why creativity is so important to any society and how our current society is not promoting it; but rather going out of its way to suppress it.  It is sort of depressing to think that I've always known this since I was in school back in the 60's & 70's, but it's not until now that someone is finally able to clearly explain the situation we've lived under for multiple generations now.",1446768000,,432,4.4
8646202,5,B00IXQUSQ4,The documentary is well designed with inspiring and creditable educators and educational/creativity research scholars.  I personally enjoyed hearing not a new fade but a momentum with historical significance that leaves you asking questions;  WHY - WHAT'S STOPPING US?  Lets take richness of our past and move it forward in Innovative ways.,1410652800,,340,5.627450980392157

8646204,5,B00IXQUSQ4,"As school systems become enmeshed in data-driven policies, students across our country are losing the opportunity to discover and use their creative gifts. As a parent of a nine year-old girl and a teacher, I wish every school district in this country would show their teachers Creativity in Education.  This documentary not only looks at the historical roots of standardized testing, but also outlines a plan for educators and parents to enable children to re-discover their creative talents so that learning can become an adventure.",1402185600,,534,5.2823529411764705
