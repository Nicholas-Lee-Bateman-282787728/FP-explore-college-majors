8147181,2,B000IONF64,"It didn't look new.  For $24.95 + S&H, I expected it to be nicely packaged with those annoying advertisements included, but the attached picture is exactly how I received it. The DVD is real old school, with very low music in the background.  I still tried to do the exercises, but it was too slow paced for me. It's definitely not worth the $24.95.",1456272000,,349,4.4375
8147182,2,B000IONF64,"Video low budget, looks like filmed in the 80s in someone's office complete with fake trees. Very basic routine, person in photo looks nothing like person in video.  I could do basic squats and forward and backward lunges on my own.  Overpriced!",1454976000,,245,4.809523809523809
8147183,4,B000IONF64,"This dvd is very old school.  Looks like its from the 80's or 90's.  That said, it is a very effective, basic and straight forward leg workout.  I made the mistake of using 8lb weights thinking I'd be fine as I'd done tons of leg workouts, but man I was so sore it was very hard to move around, go to the bathroom, climb stairs, etc.  So if you're looking for something without bells or whistles, and just legs, this is it.",1398902400,5,423,4.121951219512195
