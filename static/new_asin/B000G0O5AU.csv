8128094,4,B000G0O5AU,"Perhaps I was looking for ""yoga for completely out of shape noodle bodied wimps"" but I got this instead. I do like the ""lower body"" video from Suzanne Deason, and she even includes some modifications at the end for those of us that can't balance on one foot like a dancing pretzel. The upper body video is absolutely ridiculous. Rodney Yee expects that me, a total non-stretchy beginner, can do a backbend. Yeah, right. It would be fine if he'd suggested a modified pose or told you how to work up to the bend, but he doesn't. Rodney's Abs for beginners was perfectly fine, but perhaps that's because I've already been doing Pilates.

The inability to skip the warnings is annoying. The speech before each video, about three minutes long, is also annoying. I tend to take my tennis shoes off, take out my ponytail, and shove my cat aside while I wait for them to shut up. Then the actual work out is fine, minus the wimpitude on my part. I think perhaps after a few weeks of struggling through these videos, anyone would eventually be able to do the full poses, but until then, expect to be frustrated as you grunt while stretching, fall over while standing on one leg, and basically discover that somewhere along the line, you got old and you don't bend like you used to.",1340236800,4,1272,4.5064935064935066
8128095,4,B000G0O5AU,"The video is ok.  Good for a beginner.  Each disc is approx 20 minutes long, so helpful if you just want to do a short workout or relaxation.
However I was unable to play one disc (Upper Body) due to incompatibility with my DVD player or error with the disc itself.",1256169600,2,265,4.176470588235294
