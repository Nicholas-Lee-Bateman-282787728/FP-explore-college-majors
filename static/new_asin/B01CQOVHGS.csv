7688737,3,B01CQOVHGS,"I bought this primarily for Waterworld, but I like post-apocalyptic films so that was the bonus. So far the others are fairly lame grade B minus movies. However, it was still a great deal for the money.",1467072000,5,202,4.486486486486487

7688754,5,B01CQOVHGS,"I was not expecting much since the only one I had heard of was ""Waterworld.""  But I was happily surprized to know all of the movies are good enough to watch a second and maybe a third time.",1506470400,2,189,3.973684210526316

7688762,5,B01CQOVHGS,"Children of Men and WaterWorld are classics. Skyline and Doomsday, not so much. But the price is right even if those two were all that you got with this collection.",1499990400,,164,4.5

7688765,4,B01CQOVHGS,"Only watched 2-Waterworld, and Children of Men. The Children of Men is a bit of a downer, reminding me of what our world may look like now that we (The Politicians in DC) are killing off the EPA and associated issues. This film is the resultant of such policies, or could be. The resultant chaotic behaviors are not unlike what you see offered by the current Administration in DC. Worth a watch, just because it is well portrayed.",1485129600,4,430,4.5256410256410255

7688769,4,B01CQOVHGS,"As the marathon title suggests, it is what it is.  Easy to see why Waterworld never became what might have.  The others are pretty good, not great, but worth watching.",1482019200,,167,4.533333333333333

8753826,5,B01CQOVHGS,I'm not reviewing the movies - there are other sites for that. This review is about the DVD quality. All four movies play nicely on a 60 inch TV with no noticeable artifacts. Sound was clear and in sync with the video. I did not notice anything in all the movies that indicated a bad transfer to DVD. The disc arrived quickly and without damage.,1529539200,,345,4.323076923076923

8753828,4,B01CQOVHGS,"This is a good value for this collection of science fiction films. The DVDs include the subtitle options but there aren't any bonus features with the films, so don't expect everything that came with the original DVD releases of these movies.",1526428800,,241,4.902439024390244
