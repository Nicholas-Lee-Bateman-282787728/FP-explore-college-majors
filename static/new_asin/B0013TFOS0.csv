8252791,4,B0013TFOS0,"This classic is a must have for serious and novice musky anglers. It still has information and topics that are relevant to today's toothy critter chaser. It is fun to watch the ""young"" crew of the Lindner era In-Fisherman show using old-school rods and reels. No pounders, no double tens, no 8'6"" St. Croix's but still putting fish in the boat.
The production is a bit cheesy, in a 1980's way that indicates to me that the fishing scenes were far more important to these guys than the chit chat scenes. Just how I like it. I recommend this old school production.",1401753600,,562,4.519607843137255
