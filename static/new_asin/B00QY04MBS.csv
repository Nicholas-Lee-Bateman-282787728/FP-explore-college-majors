8693299,5,B00QY04MBS,"This is my favorite belly dance DVD. Her isolation library is absolutely perfect for learning and refining movements that one may have learned in class or from the free material that's out there. (Check out Howcast's belly dance series. Super helpful for learning how to identify moves and getting the basics.) Ruby really focuses on the muscular nature of the movements, and points out which muscles need to move to execute the isolation. In my practice, it's really helped me make the movements more precise and fluid.
The shimmy drill on this DVD is really useful too, especially if paired with other shimmy drills. She hits some that I haven't seen elsewhere. Definitely recommend this.",1469145600,5,690,5.008695652173913
