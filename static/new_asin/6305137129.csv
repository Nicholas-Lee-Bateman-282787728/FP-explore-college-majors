8243616,4,6305137129,"Addicted to Murder deftly mixes two prominent horror subgenres and comes up with something quite unique. It brings together two different kinds of monsters -- that is, it tosses a brooding serial killer into the world of  bloodsucking vampires. The story unfolds in nonlinear fashion, using  flashbacks and jumping around the timeline. Although the narrative can be a  bit confusing at times, it still pulls you in with its almost hypnotic  allure.
Joel Winter (Mick McCleery) had a rough childhood growing up in  Michigan. Abused by his parents and taunted his peers, Joel nevertheless  had a very special friend named Rachel (Laura McLauchlin) -- who just  happened to be a vampire. Somewhere down the line, they realized that they  could satisfy each other's cravings. You see, Joel likes to play with  knives and Rachel has this need to be killed (granted, she can't really die  because she's a vampire). It's a completely mutual relationship -- he  repeatedly kills her (whether by knife, chainsaw, or electrocution) and  they both walked away more or less satisfied. But after Joel's mother dies,  Rachel abandons him and he moves to New York City.
Joel, of course,  still has these cravings to kill. And that, he does. He has become a  virtually emotionless murderer, stumbling through life trying to find some  kind of meaning. Killing is a strange kind of release for him, but it still  doesn't make him feel anything. ""Why don't you feel anything,  Joel?"" he asks himself in the mirror after butchering an innocent  woman. Soon Joel meets another sexy bloodsucker named Angie (Sasha Graham),  who reminds him of you-know-who -- but what exactly does Angie want from  him?
Directed by Kevin Lindenmuth, Addicted to Murder has an uneasy,  nightmarish quality that never lets up. Set mostly against the mean streets  of New York, Addicted to Murder is gritty and strangely surreal. Visually  -- although the picture quality is a bit murky -- this film is a pleasure  to look at, with Lindenmuth using some striking camera shots and a rich  tapestry of colors to enhance the mood. This movie has atmosphere, that's  for sure.
I just wish the nonlinear narrative hadn't been so  frustrating. Maybe it's just me, maybe I had most of my brain cells  switched off when I watched Addicted to Murder, but the narrative structure  didn't quite gel with me. Also interspersed throughout the movie are TV  interviews with people regarding Joel (his ex-wife and a psychologist, for  instance). These also just seem to get in the way.
The clever script  (written by Lindenmuth and horror novelist Tom Piccirilli) has much to  admire, though, which only makes one wish that the rough spots had been  ironed out a little better. The performances by Sasha Graham and Laura  McLauchlin are pretty darn good, and Mick McCleery sure knows how to brood.  There's a lot to treasure in this shot-on-video epic, and it makes one  wonder what Kevin Lindenmuth and company could accomplish with an actual  budget.",961286400,,2996,4.951710261569416
