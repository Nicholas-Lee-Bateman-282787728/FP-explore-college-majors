884969,5,6304476434,"I'm only giving this 5 stars because of Laurel and Hardy and that's it! The shorts and films they made with Hal Roach are masterpieces and are the funniest gags/slapstick ever committed to film,along side Buster Keaton. I have no idea what 12 episodes are on this 2 disc set and I'm guessing by the price that they're probably transferred from VHS,too. If it's the silent shorts or the sound shorts,I don't know and I wish they were listed to give a better idea if this is worth buying or not. The silent shorts are already available and there are only a few of the sound shorts that are as well. If it's the same thing as somewhere else,why not give us fans something we don't have??Don't we deserve it??? I mean,other inferior comedy teams have everything they ever did is on dvd,so why not the funniest comedy team there ever was??? I wish the 12 episodes were listed. It would be nice..Only $6.98??hmmm..I doubt whatever is on there is digitally remastered..",1177545600,10,962,4.598837209302325
884970,5,6304476434,"""BlockHeads""is among the funnier Laurel & Hardy feature films. Classic laughs. Actress Mina Gombell's role of Mrs. Hardy is quite reminescent of Australian actress Mae Busch,who had played the same role in a number of the boys'films. Most memorabley in their 1933 feature""Sons Of The Desert"".

""The Music Box""is probably considered Stan and Ollie's best short subject. This film won an award for best comedy of 1932. It is my friend's favourite L&H film.

The computer colorization of both films takes getting used to. I like it and I don't. Though it does add colour to both films. Especially""The Music Box"".But it also takes away the nostalgia. Especially with the updated background music added to""The Music Box"".",1138320000,,716,5.111111111111111
884971,5,6304476434,"Stan and Ollie are jobless and down on their luck.  Before long, their jobs as a maid and butler (Stan forced to dress up in drag) go wrong, and they end up as street-sweepers.  After, unwittingly, foiling a bank robbery, they are rewarded by the bank manager with an education.  This leads to them going to an Oxford college, where they soon fall foul of student pranks.  After Stan is hit on the head by a sliding window, both he and Ollie get an education they weren't expecting.

When I first saw this film, around twenty years ago, it was one of my favourite Laurel and Hardy films, and I'd still say that now.  This is L&H at their purest - hilarious situations, great characters and a warmth so lacking in most of today's comedy.  In fact I'd say there's never a dull moment in this film, would put it up there with 'Way Out West' as L&H's finest.",1104710400,4,854,4.333333333333333
884972,4,6304476434,Awesome performance by the dynamic duo in this one.  Although the movie is quite short...just 42 minutes.  It still stands as a very funny Laurel & Hardy classic.  A definite must for any Laurel & Hardy buff.,1064707200,,208,4.5675675675675675
884973,4,6304476434,Stan and Ollie are on top form in this hilarious caper. After a brief prologue as butler and maid ( Stan in drag! ) our heroes foil a bank robbery and set off to get an education. Hollywood's Oxford offers a perfect contest for misunderstandings and slapstick. Stan's impression of a plum-in-the-mouth Brit is priceless. A breath of comic fresh air that will have the whole family laughing.,1047859200,,390,4.75

While many of them I previously acquired in another set, the picture was much clearer in this one, probably because they were able to remaster a lot of them.

 Also while still not a full length version ""Lucky Dog"" was more complete version as compared to the 7 minute clip that covered only the street and alley sequence on the other.

My only complaint (and a small one at that) is ""Wizard of Oz"" which ran for 90 minutes had no music at all to it.",1500508800,2,606,4.2894736842105265

Aside from a decent book, it's comprised of 95% of unwatchable silent shorts that have nothing to do with Laurel and Hardy. Some of these horribly grainy films are ""directed"" by Stan Laurel. Some others have about 2 minutes of a completely unknown Hardy playing the part of a policeman or some other bit part. The rest of the films are from 6th or 9th generation prints - fuzzy, scratchy and inaudible. I ended up returning this silliness for the ""Essential Laurel and Hardy"", which is a multi-disc collection of shorts that actually have appearances of the comedic team. Unless you are a real cinephile or a film student, or a L&H purist, I wouldn't waste waste your time.",1432512000,,815,4.476510067114094

I don't know how other reviews for different collections got on this page but this is for the greenish box. A reviewer on another Amazon summed up NOT buying this boxed set because while it may catch the consumer's eye at first glance, there is absolutely no way of knowing what is on the set as there are no film titles on the outside printing of the box. One would have to purchase it and open it and find out whether or not it was a good buy or not. After a little digging, I found out what is in this collection. Here is the list and you can judge for yourself if it is good bang for your L&H buck. I don't know about the quality of the film product but I'm guessing it's for public domain purists only.

885074,5,6304476434,"Required viewing if you are in the dumps.  Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy defined American humor for the better part of three decades.  This duo was pure and unfiltered talent.  Their expressions alone would rush audiences to the theatres, and if you wish to entertain kids young and old, this is for you.!  All things hysterical and often simply a reflection of the truth: Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy.",1395100800,4,397,4.7101449275362315

Nice sound, nice picture, new soundtracks for the silent classics and nice goodies added. Great and I can only recommend this box set. It's PAL and region code zero. Plays well without any problems.",1344643200,,373,4.5
885077,4,6304476434,"The product being reviewed is the WHITE BOX foreign DVD set, and NOT the Green Box U.S. release which differs in content!

***PAL FORMAT NOT FOR U.S. PLAYERS***  It will play on computers.
Please do NOT be mislead by title of this DVD set! THIS IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LAUREL & HARDY FILMS!!!!!
The bulk of this is great LAUREL OR HARDY SOLO FILMS from the silent era!
Look at the picture of the box back which describes what is in this set and you will see!

The makers of this DVD actually state that these films have not been seen on DVD before, well maybe in Germany where this DVD is made.

Laurel & Hardy Public Domain films in this set:  All have long been available on DVD, many in quality copies.
FLYING DEUCES
LUCKY DOG - a silent Stan Laurel comedy where Oliver Hardy briefly appears as a hold-up man.
MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS - re-titling of ""Babes In Toyland"" (Not really Public Domain, but apparently Germany thinks it is.)
UTOPIA - re-titling of ""Atol-K""

also included is the educational film which has a brief introduction by Laurel & Hardy A TREE IN A TEST TUBE.

Some cartoons that feature animated images of Laurel & Hardy (not their voices), again all have long been available on DVD:
Baloonland (1937 Cartoon)
The Brave Tin Soldier (1934 cartoon)
Bosko's Adventure (1933 cartoon)
Bosko's Knight Mare (1933 cartoon)
Bosko's Picture Show (1933 cartoon)

Well, that is it for Laurel AND Hardy material!  Everything else is a collection of Public Domain films, some featuring either Laurel or Hardy but not both::

A Weekend Party (1922) (Stan Laurel)
The Bakery (1921) (Larry Semon & Oliver Hardy) also on the Passport DVD
Bankrupt Honeymoon (1926) (Oliver Hardy)
Battle-Royale (1916) (Oliver Hardy) also on the Passport DVD
Bears and Bad Men (1918) (Stan Laurel)
The Bellboy (1918) re-titling of ""The Bellhop (Larry Semon & Oliver Hardy) also on the Passport DVD
Crazy to Act (1927) (Oliver Hardy) also on the Kino DVD
Detained (1924) (Stan Laurel)
The Egg (1922) (Stan Laurel) also on the Kino DVD
Fatty's Fatal Fun (1915) (Oliver Hardy)
Fiddling Around (1925) (Oliver Hardy)
Frauds and Frenzies (1918) (Larry Semon & Stan Laurel) also on the Kino DVD
Golf (1922) (Larry Semon & Oliver Hardy)

Well, you get the idea. It is a good collection of Silent Comedies, but not a collection of Laurel & Hardy as a team, as the title suggests.

I am more opposed to the misleading DVD title than the content. The silent comedies are great!  It would have been better if this set omitted the Public Domain material with them as a team.",1344556800,33,2549,4.662946428571429
885078,1,6304476434,"There seems to be no end to the exploitation of Laurel and Hardy by unscrupulous companies trying to hoodwink the unknowing public. There is no greater L&H fan on this earth than I, but of all the DVD releases available, the vast majority fall into these categories: (1) old silent movies that were made before L&H became a real team and that amount to nothing more than historical curiosities, (2) public-domain (usually lousy) prints of a few of their weaker, later movies (e.g., Atoll K, Flying Deuces), (3) worthless short-shorts (e.g., Tree in a Test Tube, The Stolen Jools), and (4) the wartime atrocities (e.g., Air Raid Wardens, Jitterbugs, The Big Noise, Nothing but Trouble).

So what's out there that's good? The two Lions Gate DVDs (Sons of the Desert, etc., and Way Out West, etc.), and from Turner, Fra Diavolo and Bonnie Scotland, and that's about it in the United States.

If you really love L&H, get the 21 DVD set from England (www.amazon.co.uk) and pick up a region-free, PAL-converting DVD player (they are widely available and not expensive). Then, with the Turner discs, you will have every L&H film worth having, restored and remastered, with colorized and foreign-language versions to boot.",1200614400,6,1214,4.975369458128079
885079,2,6304476434,"I didn't expect much from this set, and my expectations were amply met. However, I don't consider my purchase of this set to have been entirely a waste of money, as there are a couple of pieces on here that I plan on showing to my 14-year-old son by way of bridging the gap between Buster Keaton, whose work we've been watching for the past month, and Laurel & Hardy.

If you are thinking of buying this set because it appears to be a collection of Laurel & Hardy shorts, think again. Although the clips shown on the packaging are from some of the famous later shorts, none of those clips matches anything on the discs. Most of these films come from the earlier solo careers of Laurel and Hardy. I gave this set 2 stars mostly because of the false impression given by the packaging. For the contents alone, I'd give three stars.

Over-all, I am glad to have bought this set so that I could see these films. But if I lost it I would not replace it.

I'll list the titles. You can look them up on the Internet for more information; some of them you'd be able to download poorer quality versions for free. All are silent and black & white unless otherwise noted. The quality is, for the most part, decent; I was expecting far worse. There is a problem of lack of lighting on a number of the intertitles, which really ought to have been corrected, and the accompanying music lacks any relevance to the on-screen action because it is just taken from crackly old records.

Laurel and Hardy ""Masters of Comedy"" contains two disks: ""Comedy's Best Duo"" and ""Hilarious Antics"". I think these are also available separately.

 The track listing for Comedy's Best Duo is:

""Tree in a Test Tube"" 1941. Color (not colorized). Silent very limited action, with astoundingly irritating voiceover. Made by the Dept of Agriculture to advertise wood. This was the only film Laurel & Hardy made in color.

""Stolen Jools"" 1931. Listed as ""Stolen Tools"". Talkie. Has a few seconds of Laurel & Hardy. And a few seconds of Buster Keaton. And a few seconds of each of dozens of other famous actors. This was an all-star fundraising movie.

""Home Movies"" Various bits of silent home movies. I actually enjoyed watching this long segment, apart from the footage of what was probably a radio interview with Hardy which just made me wish I could lipread.

""Mud & Sand"" 1922. Stan Laurel. Worth buying the set just for this three-part movie.

""Short Kilts"" 1924. Stan Laurel. Fairly horrible quality. Actually just fairly horrible altogether.

The last title on this disk is listed as being ""The Soilers"" but they lie. It is merely an excerpt from part two of ""Mud & Sand""

 The track listing for Hilarious Antics is:

""Hop To It, Bell Hop"" 1925. Oliver Hardy and Bobby Ray.

""Saw Mill"" 1922. Larry Semon (with Oliver Hardy).

""Lucky Dog (extract)"" 1921 (but says 1917). This 17 minute extract does include the first on-screen meeting of Laurel with Hardy.

""Kid Speed"" 1924. Larry Semon (with Oliver Hardy).

""Yes Yes Nanette"" 1925. James Finlayson and Oliver Hardy. Co-directed by Stan Laurel.

""The Paper Hanger's Helper"" 1925. Oliver Hardy and Bobby Ray. This is the 10 minute re-release version of ""Stick Around"".",1186012800,30,3186,4.665474060822898
