Forensic Files: Season 1-8 Bundle (16 Disc Collection) Amazon.com Exclusive ONLY!
(This is not a review for the Forensic Files episodes)

I was ready to jump at this deal until I noticed,

""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media""

If you are familiar with cd/dvd technology, you will know that dvd-r, dvd+r or any 'burned' discs are notoriously unreliable and over time may fail. (Burned discs use a laser to etch information into a layer of ink instead of a standard 'molded' disc)

Sorry Amazon, but your return policy will not help me 2 years down the road when these discs start to fail.",1348704000,32,632,4.770642201834862
4857623,5,B005PTNVN4,"I love this show because I want to learn how forensic works. Forensic was cool to learn and how the scientists use science to catch the evil murderers and bring him or her to court to pay for their horrific crimes. Scientists use many different computers and cool techinques like DNA testing, finger printing testing, and fire arm examining. If you love Forensic Files like I do, buy this dvd.",1343952000,,393,4.628571428571429
4857624,5,B005PTNVN4,I purchased all 8 volumes and want more to be released. I put this series in the same category as Unsolved Mysteries because it is that entertaining and won't hold back to purchase more if it is released in another 8 volume DVD bundle!

ONE complaint: I was hoping this set would contain my all-time fave episode entitled, ""The Alibi"". No such luck.
Consolation: ""Chief Evidence"" was included which is another fave. Seriously groundbreaking s***. Spine-tingling as EVER.

This set is totally worth it.",1400630400,,541,4.74468085106383

I got tired of watching reruns of the show on HLN so I bought the 1-8 set. Out of all the 90 plus episodes maybe about 20 are reruns HLN shows every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night so around 70 cases were new to me. I'm sure there's some episodes floating around that the DVD set nor HLN have jurisdiction of that may never be seen.",1399507200,,456,4.376470588235295

4857654,5,B005PTNVN4,"My husband (and I) is a big Forensic Files Fan, so I was stoked when I saw this bundle! I got it for him for Christmas and he of course loved it. The only thing I would wish for, is that it came in some kind of box set and not just loose DVD cases. This is not enough, though, that I would want to give it less stars - just a little hint to the makers of this. ;)",1390003200,,363,3.55
4857655,5,B005PTNVN4,"This is a other fantastic program that started off on CourtTV. Now it is gone & so is the channel formerly known as ""CourtTV"", which has been replaced by something called ""TruTV"". Yep. ""Tru-Waste of TV"".  It is a shame that CourtTV is gone & all the great shows that we used to be able to watch on the channel are gone as well......
We needed TruTv & their ""not reality, actuality"" programming like we need to share a bubble bath with 500 starving piranhas.

I loved this series & had no clue it was available for purchase until I stumbled across the ""Crimes of Passion"" set at the big W store for $5. I snapped that up & brought it home to watch & enjoy. Made me miss this series even more. (sigh..)

I so wish there were more episodes being made of this series. Unfortunately there are homicides daily, so it is not lacking for material to make episodes.
So if you want to see these fantastic episodes there are two choices at this time

#1. On the weekends, you can catch the show over on HLN. It does have a different name on that channel. The episodes can be found under the name of ""Mystery Detectives"". It is very easy to identify that it is Forensic Files. It uses the same beginning, music, narrator, etc.  Just the name is different.

# 2. Buy these videos & as another reviewer stated ""Have your OWN marathon of Forensic Files"". The upside is no commercials. The downside is no commercials when you want to get a snack, go take a bathroom break, etc.

I just bought this collection of eight different video selections, just ten days ago (17 December 2013) as a gift to myself for Christmas after a friend gave me a $50 gift certificate. The price at the time was $37.49.  On the 23rd of December the price was $62.99. Today on 27 December 2013, the price is (gasp!) $69.95.

In a week & a halfs time the price has increased by $32.46. Or almost doubled in price. That is amazing.
I have not looked around to see what it would cost to buy the eight discs individually to see if the price would be better.

With that being said, if you are a die hard fan or think you would enjoy the videos, you can look at it like this.
There are 96 episodes.  Divide the 96 by $69.95 & it comes to about $0.73 an episode. Not quite as bad.

Now there is a sign up stating 1 to 2 weeks before you get the videos. Amazon gets three extra stars because I ordered on 17 December 2013 & I received it on 24 December 2013.
It was a nice surprise as I had not even started to look out for the video shipping information yet!

My educational background is criminal justice & I love to watch these videos & the one I think is the most fascinating that was ever covered on Forensic Files was when Drew Planten was caught & was arrested & charged with the murder of Stephanie Bennett.
It is a possibility that he murdered more than just Ms. Bennett.

I guess we might never know for sure as he committed suicide not too long after his arrest.

When you see a cold case solved after years of inactivity, it just makes you feel awe that science & old fashioned police work come together & bring answers after so long of not knowing.

I would recommend this series to those that are interested in pursuing a career in forensics, science, police work, or just someone that is interested in this type of programming.

It is not CSI & you will notice in police & scientists that work on these true life cases that the entire investigation is not wrapped up in 44 minutes in a bow like it is on that show.

In conclusion I give everything about this experience a 10 's for the series, the shipping, arrival time.  Perfect all the way around.

Thanks Amazon, another great job!!

PS. I noticed that someone mentioned this disc set a DVD R set of videos. I bought a set from the big W store right around Black Friday for $5 (Crimes of Passion). The discs look slightly different between the set I bought at the W & the Amazon set.  I am going to hope for the best.",1388102400,4,3939,4.2520107238605895
4857656,5,B005PTNVN4,"If you are a fan of The ID channel shows, or COLD CASE FILES, AMERICAN JUSTICE, etc., then this FORENSIC FILES collection is a must! Narrated impeccably by Peter Thomas, each episode is like a mini-documentary loaded w/ twists, turns, and suspense. All taken from real events and presented without commercial interruption. I've watched all of these multiple times and never tire of the stories. From serial killers to those wanting to cash in on their ""loved"" ones' life insurance, these stories run the gamut of nefarious criminal activity. Thankfully, the forensics are here to assist the good guys in their endless pursuit of solid, scientific evidence! Some of which is absolutely amazing! These are fascinating, true stories w/ actual offenders that can be far creepier than any fictional maniacs. Some of the lengths they will go to in order to commit these homicides is jaw-dropping, and many times heart-rending. Very frightening at times, this series is a classic!...",1387756800,2,976,5.144654088050315
4857657,3,B005PTNVN4,"This product is not exactly what is advertised. It is a collection of episodes by category, taken from many different seasons, not organized by season. The categories are Convictions Overturned, Serial Killers, Historic Cases, Medical Mysteries, Crimes of Passion, Kidnapping Cases, Sex Crimes,  and Death by Poison. Each of the 8 DVD cases contains two DVD's and a total of 12 episodes, for a total for the package of 96 episodes. I'm pretty sure that a collection which truly contained all of the episodes from seasons 1 thru 8 would contain more than 96 episodes.  The reason I ordered the product was because is missed several of the episodes from seasons 1-8, but most of the episodes I missed are not in this product. Now I still might have ordered the product even if I was given the correct description, because there are enough episodes that I have not seen to make it worth while. But I was disappointed to see a product coming directly from Amazon with such an inaccurate description.

Many people have also complained about the quality and durability of the DVD's, but I have just started watching them so I cannot comment on that yet.",1385856000,2,1147,4.7537688442211055
4857658,5,B005PTNVN4,"Now I can have my own marathons whenever I want!  One summer, I stayed home and literally watched every episode I could.  That next school year I taught forensics to my 6th graders and they ate it up.  I used the info. from the series, as well as supplemental texts, and my students couldn't get enough!  Now that I have the DVDs, it's is just icing on the cake.  The DVDs are just like the series from court t.v., minus the commercials (YAY!).

4857659,5,B005PTNVN4,"I watched F.F. from the earlier days on Court TV. It's still one of the best documentary/crime shows around, though now off the air. It leaped the forensic field into main stream, showing the public how crimes can be solved via blood, fingerprints, and everything in between. Some stories will shock and stay with you, believe me. Note, these aired on TV so there's not an excessive use of gore if that's what your wondering. Each 30 minute episode is delivered with heart, technical info, and great re-enactments of actual cases with friends or family speaking of their story. The narrator's low, soothing voice pulls you in until the last sentence. They don't play reruns anymore. Perhaps this is to sell more DVD's. The series is a chilling look into the world of true crime stories and the heartache that families go through after tragic incidents. I will definitely buy these and I recommend them to fans of true crime. This show is the real deal.  ID channel has some good crime shows as well that play 24/7 that keep my wife and I interested.

4857675,4,B005PTNVN4,"I was always a big Columbo fan, loving to watch him put all the pieces of the puzzle together and solve the crime.  Then just this year, I discovered Forensics Files, although it has apparently been on for years.  (So obviously, I would not make a good investigator!)  I was instantly hooked.  I loved how they solved each mystery in a concise, half-hour show using forensic techniques, many of which were not available when I was growing up.  I looked on Amazon to see if the show was available on DVD.  I came across this set and ordered it.

My kids don't like me watching Forensic Files because they find it too morbid.  I told them it's not the crimes/murders that I find interesting, it's the wide variety of forensics they now use to solve crimes (and most methods are far more sophisticated than they used to be):  finger prints, palm prints, foot prints, shoe prints, tire prints, DNA samples from blood, hair, saliva, skin, etc., cell phone records, gun/bullet ballistics, Internet/computer searches, sketch artists, entomological analysis, chemical analysis, blood analysis, hypnotists, arson investigations, hand writing analysis, facial reconstruction, criminal profiling, etc., etc., etc.  It makes me wonder what other techniques might become available over the next few years.  To me, DNA analysis is especially fascinating, and I love it when they can clear someone who otherwise would be declared guilty, or exonerate someone after being falsely imprisoned.  It's great when someone is so sure they committed the perfect crime that they'll never be caught, only to have modern day forensics nab them.

As far as the DVD set itself, I thought it was reasonably priced.  Amazon prices vary, but at the time I ordered the set, it was cheaper to order the set than to order the DVD's individually as someone else had said.  Although the website said it normally ships in 1-2 weeks, I had my set just 4 days after I ordered it.  There are a of couple things that I don't like about the set.  Closed captioning is not available on the DVD's (nor is it available through my TV for this set, as is sometimes the case when DVD's don't have it).  Also, the music is louder than the other parts of the show, so the volume tends to fluctuate.  If it weren't for these two minor things, I would rate the set with 5 stars.

All in all, I love the show and like the DVD set.  I would recommend it to any Forensics Files fan who would like the set for themselves without the fuss of trying to watch/record it off of TV.",1356998400,4,2521,4.6840909090909095
