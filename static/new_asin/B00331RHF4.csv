4062890,5,B00331RHF4,"I fell in love with the ""Murphy's Law"" series in its season one waiting anxiously for the next season and here it is.

Although I found season two far bloodier than season one; my admiration for the series remains very high.  The program retains its original premise--Irish undercover cop (played wonderfully by James Nesbitt) goes undercover into the world(s) of some suspected thugs or of some persons doing some bad stuff in order to gain information regarding a particular crime or unpleasant situation (such as a murder or kidnapping.) in order to eventually make an arrest or to prevent another crime or murder from happening.  Season two maintains its high standard of highly interesting and well directed episodes with great acting by all involved especially James Nesbitt.  Nesbitt is simply fabulous as Tommy Murphy who is ""full of hysterical one liners"" (while carrying out some gritty undercover police work and always putting himself  in grave danger and carrying inside him a the deep dark burden of his child being killed).

The writing is also so very good in this season.  So if you like me have a little trouble understanding an Irish accent use the subtitles.  Believe me, you don't want to miss one hysterical line that Nesbitt delivers.  It is really Television at its very best.

Please note, the episode titled ""The Group""  is a real stand out.  James Nesbitt gives an outstanding performance.  To me, very worthy of an Emmy award for ""outstanding actor"".  You'll have to see it to see what I am talking about.",1273622400,5,1533,4.891472868217054
4062891,5,B00331RHF4,"You will find it hard to take your eyes away, even with all the blood & violence because of the intriguing stories and action. Murphy (James Nesbitt), the wild Irish copper, who sometimes reacts in a rather volatile fashion, yet experiences personal mental anguish over his daughter's murder and his own part in that past event. Now in London, he serves as an undercover investigator in all kinds of situations, playing whatever lowlife role is needed, and so convincingly, but not always by the books. This covert series is unrated but very adult, with violence, blood, earthy language, nudity, and the disturbing life you'd expect to see the undercover cops enter to find the lowest of criminals.

DS Tommy Murphy (undercover cop with a haunting past) has a rugged body that takes abuse frequently, a mind always a step ahead of the people around him (be they the low-life he's undercover to investigate or other coppers), and he's funny. He has a smart mouth, quick wit that generally opens with a biting comment at just the wrong time, getting himself a fist or other injury, or when he's getting close to a romantic moment, which usually ices all inspiration.

Carter (Del Synnott) another copper, is a regular as is Father McBride(Mark Benton) an old Irish friend of Murphy's who tries to help, but can compound a decision. Clarke (Sarah Berger) is now the leading female cop.

All 6 episodes come with the available SUBTITLE option, which also helps those who struggle with the thick Irish brogue of Nesbitt. It's a strong accent but quite lovable.

Non-spoiler details of individual episodes:
1  JACK'S BACK  DI Guthrie (Claudia Harrison, a regular in Series 1)is stabbed to death while doing a covert homeless gig. Murphy takes a turn as homeless (and humorously) to find a serial killer. A shelter's counselor/preacher, Rev. Norris (Andrew Bicknell) seems suspect. A surprise violent ending.

2  BENT MOON N THE RISE  Reassigned to a drug squad after a cop suicide, Murphy looks at an inside police racial problem. Another insider problem may be the real factor, and another DC dies. Murphy includes within his cop-squad investigation a close check of beautiful DC Mel Kovacs (Kristy Mitchell), up-close and personally.

3  RINGERS  Murphy goes undercover with INTERPOL officer Benoit (William Nadylam) in a car smuggling ring headed by Raines (Raad Rawi.) Quick success but Raines avoids arrest. Something is fishy in car theft dealings. What's the bigger prize?

4  GO ASK ALICE  A drowned child case, claimed by mother to have been poisoned by chemical waste, has evidence she may have been right. For proof, Murphy is sent undercover as a 'cleaning man'. Seems to be plenty of cover-up to uncover by this undercover cop in coveralls. 6 dead but a good ending.

5  CONVENT  DS Murphy goes undercover in a convent--Oh sure! right! Holy unbelievable. A suicide nun? Is the convent shower scene necessary? Drugs & nuns seems to be a comedy episode but the bodies prove otherwise. PRAY 'Father' Murphy (this episode's covert gig) solves the mystery fast.

6  THE GROUP  Undercover in a psychologist's treatment/support group, Murphy discovers the name and location of his daughter's IRA murderer. How will the explosive characteristic of Murphy's personality cause him to react? ...well, besides sleeping with the gorgeous married female support group's member? Murphy's emotional heart bleeds in this episode.

Made for BBC Northern Ireland, seen on BBC America, not on DVD and worth it for adult viewing, not for children. A strong British crime drama series.",1267574400,8,3570,5.035714285714286
