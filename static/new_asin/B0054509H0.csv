A colorful story filled with entertaining characters played by Eva Longoria as the mayor with other great actresses like Kate Del Castillo, Yvette Yates and Monica Huarte.",1361059200,3,249,4.9523809523809526

A subject little known in our country.
Eva longoria is as charming as can be.",1349395200,,120,5.05
4557983,4,B0054509H0,"After having read the mixed reviews on this movie I decided to give a shot anyway.  I am glad I did.  I figured going in with low expectations would allow me to enjoy it.  The cover is a little misleading in that it looks like there will be some sort of relationship between Eva and Christian, there really wasn't.  It wasn't a cheesy romantic comedy, which I had thoughts of suckering my husband in to watch.  I am glad I didn't b/c he would have been asleep very quickly.  On the other hand it was a light hearted look of what happens when an old school traditional town (where the men do all the work and the women tend house, children, and bedroom) has the men removed (except the priest).  It does not take itself too seriously nor should the viewer. That being said I will be recommending it to my books and movies club since it raises some fun topics for women to think about and discuss.",1348272000,2,895,4.291666666666667
4557984,5,B0054509H0,I love this movie first it has an all Latina Cast Eva Longoria who doesn't love her and the next Mexican Queen Kate Del Castillo I love her in this movie I love her in general She puts her on twist on every character she plays and You can see the Humanity in her that is rare.  just a great movie buy you won't be disappointed,1338336000,3,326,3.9393939393939394
4557985,1,B0054509H0,"Some movies beg indulgence form the audience. This movie should beg forgiveness  from the people who financed it. Based on a novel by James Canon and adapted for the screen and directed by Gabriela Tagliavini, the story (what little there is of it) concerns the women of a remote Latin American town who are forced to pick up the pieces and remake their world when all the town's men are forcibly recruited by communist guerrillas. They are devastated that they have to do `men's work' such as cleaning the town and governing the village. The local priest (Oscar Nuez) prays to God and is instructed that he must populate the village with new men by sleeping with all the women of childbearing age. Unable to perform his duties, he is ostracized.  One woman (Eva Longoria) becomes mayor and the women gradually make the town a women's place - yes, even to the point of deciding that physical relationships between women are just fine and clothing is optional.  A side bar story that simply doesn't fit is the presence of a reporter (Christian Slater) who is sent by his boss (Camryn Manheim) to get a front page article about the little town of only women. Et cetera.....

The lines these poor actors are giving are so poor that they are embarrassing, but the level of acting in general is on the junior high school level.  Slater has so little to do that it seems as though he was hired simply to sell tickets in the theaters.  This is a `must miss' little bit of deflated fluff.

4557986,4,B0054509H0,"I'm always up for an independent movie.  Never quite know what you're gonna get.

This one was a pleasant surprise.  It's a cute comedy about what happens when all the men in small village are shanghaied off to war and the women have to take charge.  They find that they're capable of all kinds of new things, including finding love.  It's light, slightly over the top and never takes itself too seriously.  There's some genuine lol moments and lots of others that'll give you a chuckle.  (If the priest doing his ""duty"" doesn't start you laughing, you're wound too tight!)

If you're in the mood for something light, sweet and funny, give this one a try.",1331942400,5,655,4.586206896551724

8456168,3,B0054509H0,"this movie starts off in a small Latino village  with a priest and  lots of women and a few good men
the mayor of the village does a sort of good job and his wife, well she is very bossy
one day the Latino soldiers come into the village and take or kill all the men
so, there is only women left to run the village, so  how are women going to do this,
there is the priest still there, and a brothel  full of women and the mayor's wife(eva longoria)
a newspaper reporter hears about this and ask to go there to write the story, about what, no idea
but, he(christian Slater) was determined to find a story , so he could get paid and get some respect
eva longoria becomes the mayor of a village of all women, the women have no idea what to do or how
so, a few of them fell in love with each other, than the preist got an idea and sworn god told him to do it
take advantage of this and put your differences aside and make out with each and every women
so to save the village and have baby boys, so to grow the village, it kind of happens
but there is a few younger girls that never had sex before and some, just could not do it
because he was the priest anyway, none of the women got pregnant, so the women have to learn how to
run the village with men, later the reporter comes to the village  because he found the diary of the priest that had been
run out of the village, because he was shooting blank his flag did not fly to the heavens no more,
the reporter comes to see whats going on and wants to get a story and send it back  to the paper
the women go absolutely nuts knowing a man is there, just the smell of a real man  did for them
but the women decide not to talk to him and talk him into leaving because he was causing problems , by just being there
the story goes on , but some weird things happen some of the women get stronger minds and the village
is doing well without men! its funny and you will see women kissing women but that's about all.
the point of this funny story is how women learn to survive with men !",1516924800,,2025,3.924390243902439
8456169,2,B0054509H0,"This is a Spanish comedy, not sexy at all. The men in the village are taken away to serve in the military. The women chatter about small stuff. No lesbian activities, no sex at all. Boring.",1513123200,,189,4.277777777777778
8456170,1,B0054509H0,"This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. We watched it because we found it for a buck and figured, why not? It had enough five-star reviews to make it seem worthwhile, but as one reviewer says, I now think that many of the high reviews are fake because this film is truly bad. The script is contrived and the acting is completely uninspired, but what's even worse are the direction and the editing. I didn't see a single redeeming quality in this film--after half an hour or so it was painful to watch, and I was feeling embarrassed for the actors and actresses. The film goes nowhere. Period. It looked more like something done by a group of high school students who had a few classes on film-making than something made by professionals.",1477094400,,751,4.489051094890511
