3728989,5,B001O5LVVM,"Promising new director STUART TOWNSEND -- perhaps better known for his starring roles in films such as ""A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""Queen of the Damned"" -- proves to be an effective storyteller with his skillful and dramatic recreation of events surrounding the historic World Trade Organiation riots in Seattle.  Featuring an impressive, but not distracting, all-star cast, ""Battle In Seattle"" presents an effective and engaging look at the motivations behind those forces who want to control the world's marketplace, with those who will fight for freedom, opportunity and balance in commerce.  Regardless of one's political or economic leanings, the film holds the audience by presenting the human-drama endured by participants on both sides of the police lines.  Townsend handles his cast with skill and grace, perhaps borne from years of his own experience in front of the camera.  Given a more traditionally structured screenplay (and a less controversial topic), you can expect to see something truly profound from Stuart Townsend in upcoming films.  Check out ""Battle in Seattle,"" and enjoy!",1231286400,23,1111,5.436046511627907
3728990,5,B001O5LVVM,"I was lucky enough to see this film in advance, and it opened my eyes to a few very important issues.

Going in, I'd never even heard of the ""battle in Seattle,"" as I was only 13 years old at the time of the protests. But now that I'm aware of the event, it makes me wonder why the controversies with the WTO aren't still being discussed on a larger scale.

This is something that we should all be concerned about, and Stuart Townsend has done us a favor by introducing the issues in a format that is riveting, informative, and inspirational. If there's one thing Battle in Seattle does best, it's that it fires you up to take action any way you can.

Not to mention the great production values, absolutely stellar cast, and intense action sequences (Intense because they're real! Actual footage was used).

I would highly recommend attending a showing of this film with your family and friends, because these matters are important to us all, and Stuart's presentation of them is nothing short of breathtaking.",1221177600,24,1010,4.625698324022347

3728993,5,B001O5LVVM,"Good movie with great cast. Part drama, part documentary, with lots of actual protest footage.

The WTO protests were expressly nonviolent. But mysterious, unknown anarchists, who were not part of the protests, caused property damage that the protestors were blamed for. The protestors and organizers condemned the anarchists, who, as it turned out, were provocateurs who deliberately sabotaged the demonstrations and provoked the police and National Guard to attack protestors and media.

The same thing is happening now during the 2017 protests, with ninja-like masked figures dressed all in black causing all the violence and property damage that the protestors are being blamed for.

But despite being controversial, this movie is definitely worth watching.",1486598400,,761,5.657894736842105

3729000,3,B001O5LVVM,"This is a mildly interesting fictional account of the 1999 WTO protest in Seattle.

The story focuses primarily on the activities of a variety of protesters opposed to international trade policies promoted and negotiated by the World Trade Organization.  Their concern is that the WTO favors commercial interests over a variety of non-commercial human interests  The film offers some modest insight into the motivations of a subset of individual protesters and their actions on the streets of Seattle during a several-day meeting of the WTO.  There is also a story subplot showing the activities of police as seen through the eyes of a few officers, the city mayor, and a handful of other characters.

With so many characters and a storyline focused on political and social issues, there is only limited opportunity for characterization in a film like this.  As such, we only get a few fragmented glimpses into what motivates the people involved, and the issues they are protesting similarly receive superficial treatment.  There is some focus on the internal meetings of the WTO via a few additional characters, but the latter also receives superficial and fragmented treatment.

As a whole the movie comes across as part propaganda and part procedural coverage of a few days in the life of a protester.  There is some intellectual value in the film but not much entertainment or deep insight provided.  A documentary treatment of the protest would probably better serve viewers than this fictional account.

One thing I have sometimes wondered is what truly motivates protest groups such as this to commit the time and resources that they do.  From the outside it seems more like a social gathering rather than a deeply motivated political cause.  If it's the latter, I wonder why group chanting rituals with simplistic messages are considered more valuable than thoughtful discourse through presentations, published essays, blogs, etc.  Considering the significant property damage, commercial disruption, and public turmoil that WTO-style protests cause, I would think that more civil communication formats would be a more effective means of conveying one's message.  It's hard to take someone's viewpoint seriously if they resort to either civil disruption or violence.  The latter is just either criminal conduct or a display of narcissism.

There is some modest value in this film, but I would have been interested in something that offered a deeper treatment of the subject and the motivations of the individuals.",1467417600,5,2520,5.2443890274314215

I could write a whole review on this movie and what I believe it stands for. I could rant about the problems we are facing all around the world from health care, to clean water, to war, to drugs, to money, farming, the food industry, laws, religion, ethics, you name it. I could argue about how governments can be greedy or how the media can be corrupt but I think the movie can speak for itself.

3729013,4,B001O5LVVM,"This is a film concerning the 1999 Seattle World Trade Organisation meeting. Protestors had planned in advance to disrupt the meeting seeing the WTO as an unelected, unaccountable, self interest group that continues to put profit before people and denies legitimate scrutiny a voice.

It has a few stories on the go to show what happens to both sides of the argument(s). Woody Harrelson plays a violent cop whose pregnant wife gets caught up and Channing Tatum is here in an early role also as a cop. Ray Liotta plays the City Mayor who is torn between having a successful summit and not wanting to use violence.

There are a number of issues touched on here and the film struggles to be balanced to both sides - using the individual stories to illustrate how both sides do wrong. That could be where it falls down - it tries too hard to be reasonable. The WTO is a self interest group who uses sticking plaster solutions to Global problems as a smokescreen to its bloated ambitions of World trade and the never ending greed engendered by the profit motive.

The acting though is all very good, but it does get a bit over emotional on one too many occasions. In stressful situations - feelings do run high and as such the lapses here are forgivable. Having said all of the above I still thought this was a compelling watch and so can recommend.",1439769600,,1344,4.545454545454546

3729015,5,B001O5LVVM,"My only objection to this well made movie with terrific acting is that at the time of the protest, the only protestors committing acts of violence and vandalism were uniformly dressed in black with their faces concealed. They were voiceless, violent, and still seem to be as unaccountable now as they were at the time of the Seattle protest.  In this movie, they were made to seem like real protestors with real voices, but that's not how it actually was.  The real protestors were trying to stop these athletes in black, if anything, while asking why were they being violent when it was a peaceful demonstration, etc.  The heavy-handed police retaliation began only as a response to the few violent 'protestors', oddly all physically very fit and athletic and  in their late twenties and early thirties.  Odd about their consistency, isn't it?  And if they had been real protestors, why would they have remained silent, instead of singing protests, carrying signs and/or sitting like typical protestors?  No, they were too busy destroying things and then vanishing into thin air, as though they had completed a mission.  Anyone curious?",1436832000,9,1137,5.01063829787234

I was researching smart meters and how to protect myself from them (there are 12 meters on my apartment building) and kept running into all kinds of other things: in addition to smart meters, geo engineering (still not clear on this one), enforced vaccinations, fracking (See Gasland 1 and 2), the TPP/Fast Track and lastly, this fantastic film.  One shocking thing, among many others, GATT began in 1947!  The WTO in 1995.  So now we encounter the issue again!  Who is going to stop this Corporate juggernaut?  For myself, I am acting like we still have a democracy and spend a lot of time emailing, writing, phoning my representatives and lending my energy wherever I can.  But this film is the most energizing for me.  To see how the militarized police in Seattle harmed so many NON VIOLENT protestors was sickening! (There was actual archival footage, so the film can't be accused of making this up!) Yes, there were a few anarchists, very few.  And of course that is where the media concentrates their 'news'.  See Baltimore for the bastardization of that event.  I digress a lot, but all this related.  It is global and requires all of us to do SOMETHING.

3729026,2,B001O5LVVM,"I was trying figure out what happened to make this film such disappointment. My guess is Hollywood packaging of talent and concept.

3729027,2,B001O5LVVM,"These disaster-type flicks should never be made (this is in that genre, is it not?).  After all, have you ever seen one that was any good?  Maybe the first ""Poseiden Adventure"" I suppose.  Perhaps ""Titanic"" had its moments.  But then again you might argue, ""Well, why did you rent this film then?"" and you'd have a point.  Now, I'll get onto that point.

I used to live in Seattle, but I just got too tired of the rain - and all those really friendly people, some of whom you will see on screen - so I decided it was time to move.  And while I lived in Seattle, I was not there at the time of the protests.  I was out of the country at the time, so I had to watch this fine city get torched to the ground from afar.  I guess that it was better than being there based upon the actual footage that's in this very-mediocre-at-best film.  But anyway, I decided to rent this movie since I wanted to see what happened finally, many years later.

Now, this is a fictionalized account.  I wanted to also watch because I had just reviewed ""Young Adult"" - which I really liked - and I noticed that Charlize Theron was in this one as well.  In ""Battle"" she plays a gal who is married to a cop, where she is pregnant.  Now, some very artificial plot device is used to show how his line of work adversely effects her and therefore both of them.  Won't say what that device is, but I will say the following:  Ugh.

Now, for full disclosure, I'm not much of a fan of protests and protesters over all, especially in the United States.  ""What do you have to protest about?  Having to pay slightly higher gas prices?"" might be a question I might ask.  While I fully realize that this country is far from perfect, we don't really have it all that bad so, why do people put their lives on the line for such pointless reasons?

Well, protesting is your right, and protest away.  But it's hard to protest the following:  this movie is pretty forgettable.  And this movie probably shouldn't have been made.  And I surely shouldn't have wasted neither my time nor my money on this disaster.",1348790400,,2066,4.290155440414508
3729028,2,B001O5LVVM,"Like other reviewers, I was there.  I worked across the street from Nike Town which rec'd a lot of the protester's wrath.  The plot was very contrived.  The peeps in the street were punks.  I should have gotten off the bus on the way d/t that morning.  Two kids got on and refused to pay the toll.  They were having a stand-off w/ the bus driver who wouldn't move the bus if they didn't pay.  Sitting by the door, I grabbed one kid's hat and threw it through the door.  When the punk puffed up, I said I was buying it and offered to pay his fare.  I had 10"" and 50lb on him.  He got off that bus and we went d/t for an exciting day.",1347926400,,632,3.905511811023622
3729029,4,B001O5LVVM,"I finally got an opportunity to see this movie last night and while I think it was very good overall, there are some things that bugged me about it. First, the good parts. The pacing of the movie is perfect. The action is constant without being overwhelming and the tension between the protestors and police is palpable. Woody Harrelson does another great job and Ray Liotta is understated, but effective, as the city's major. The movie also does a great job of explaining why the protestors were protesting against the WTO and it is fairly balanced in its approach to all of the participants without resorting to hero-worship or demonization. In short, there is a lot to like about this movie.

However, I would recommend this movie with a couple of caveats. First, the movie is never sure whether it wants to be a drama or a documentary. If this were a movie about something innocuous like the Olympics or a sporting event, that would be fine. However, this is an event that is still quite emotionally charged to a lot of people and to waver back and forth between drama and documentary does a disservice to both genres. In other words, it would either have been a stronger and more meaningful drama or documentary if it has been one or the other and not tried to be both. The second quibble I have is with the depiction of the protestors. Overall, it is not a bad depiction. It is certainly MUCH better than the mass media's cartoonish depiction of the protestors as being a bunch of bomb-throwing anarchists looking to destroy all that is good. However, the movie does depict them as naive and at worst, mentally and hygienically challenged. I mean, one guy is out there putting up with beatings from police, tear gas and arrests because he wants to save the turtles? Really?

Again, I did enjoy this movie and it is one that I do recommend watching if you want to know about this historic event that is still something of a traumatic event for many who experienced it in Seattle. The acting is great and the storyline is compelling. Just be aware that it probably will not be the last word on the topic.",1335657600,,2108,4.559366754617415
3729030,4,B001O5LVVM,"the cast was fantastic and the story was told genuinely. this movie demonstrates what a protest is through the eyes of a protester, civilian trying to get from point A to point B, and the police man who is just doing his job. have you ever wanted to know the reality of what people in the middle of a protest go through? this is the movie that tells you the truth, the tragic truth. the protesters fight for what they believe in while the law enforcement are told to hold them back or end their march. their is also the reporter covering what the media wants you to see, and unfortunately there are always those unfortunate civilians trapped in a protest, and become victims.(SPOILERS) a mother loses her unborn child because  of the unnecessary strategy and methods police men use and a police man loses his son or daughter because of what a police man did. there are also protesters who feel like every profitable business is the perfect target to get back at the WTO. And unfortunately those irresponsible actions from those few who protest with violence force the police to generalize every protester as being aggressors. and of course that reporter who instead of covering the event experiences what she sees, and her humanity forces her to do the right thing.

based on the reviews below or above, i thought the movie was going to be poor. to my surprise the movie was an incredible experience which made me cry and see the bigger picture of what a protester must go through to get a message across the ears of the civilian judging them at home watching the news and the people that force them to fight in order to make a difference.",1321488000,5,1639,4.552542372881356

As a matter of fact, the movie delves much too deeply into the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of the protests.  I think that as a fact finding movie, it is alright.  I think as a form of entertainment, it is rather lengthy.  It could use an Oliver Stone treatment.",1259971200,,369,4.382352941176471
3729040,5,B001O5LVVM,"This movie has incredible editing, sound, music, and especially content. The message is beyond powerful and it deals with some of the most important subject matter possible - human rights, creating a better world, and freedom and democracy. Having worked at Blockbuster Video for years, I've seen countless films, and this is in the top 10 I'd recommend to anyone. To me personally I'd put it at the top of the list. It's suspenseful, unpredictable, action packed, emotional, dramatic, and based on an incredible true story that happened in Seattle in 1999. This film can inspire anyone to join the movement to do their part for a better world!",1254096000,5,644,4.91743119266055
3729041,4,B001O5LVVM,"All I knew of Stuart Townsend prior to watching this movie [which he has ably directed] was that he is an actor and also boyfriend of Charlize Theron. Well, ""Battle in Seattle"" showcases his directing talent, and has a reputable cast in it too. The movie makes for a riveting watch from the beginning, when a brief history of how the WTO came about is shown, right till the very end. The premise of the movie has to do with the WTO conference held in Seattle in 1999, when riots broke out and violence escalated between rioters and the police. There are three 'camps' in this movie - the first are the protestors, as played by Michelle Rodriguez, Martin Henderson, Jennifer Carpenter and Andre Benjamin. The second is the mayor who is trying his best to coordinate the event without too much interference or disruption [the mayor's role is portrayed by Ray Liotta], and finally, there's the couple looking forward to their first baby [played by Woody Harrelson in a cop role & Charlize Theron] and how the riots impact their lives.

The action almost never lets up from the get go - as a viewer, I almost felt like I was there during the riots, its so real and well-portrayed. Townsend effectively weaves in the storytelling with actual video footage of the events as it happened back in 1999. The cast does an excellent job as well, credibly portraying the various story arcs, especially those of the protestors and Michelle Rodriguez's performance is a highlight in this movie. The story arc featuring Wooody Harrelson and Charlize Theron struck a rather false note for me, and seemed overly melodramatic. On the whole though, this is quite a powerful movie with a compelling voice and I highly recommend it to those who love social dramas focused on activism.",1251244800,3,1762,4.739413680781759
3729042,5,B001O5LVVM,"I've come to expect movies about political or social justice issues to be watered down.  I still enjoy them, because I love the subject matter.  ""Erin Brokovich"" was pretty good.  I actually loved it.  But ""Battle In Seattle"" was awesome!  Many movies that try to show all sides lose something in their attempt to be fair, but this one is high-octane powerful AND realistic.  I'm an activist in Long Beach, California and really admired the protestors' use of strategy.  They were so prepared!  There was a scene that I will not give away about a broadcast journalist that I wondered about, but loved anyway.  Characterization of the mayor of Seattle, caught between many forces, and the police of Seattle, unprepared, overworked, and working long shifts without meals, was also realistic, compassionate without making excuses for their violent behavior.  It was really shocking.  I met a young woman who had been there and told me how a group of protestors were tear-gassed on a police bus even though they were already seated, handcuffed, and completely unable to defend themselves.  It's not in the movie but fits the violence shown in the movie.  Of course the protestors were the heroes of the movie.  Am I biased?  You bet!!
People who stand for truth and justice are owed our bias, in my humble (I wish) opinion.  The movie even covers tactics used by violent protestors, and the conflict between them and the largely non-violent other protestors.  Another good thing about this movie is that it is not overdramatic.  Many Hollywood movies overdo things to be ""powerful.""  This movie is somehow both truly powerful yet also understated (without being precious about it).  I suspect that the scecret of this movie's success is the sinceriy of its director.  In the special features section, he describes how he wanted to be fair to all concerned (protestors, mayor, police, even WTO), yet make a true and honest statement of the horrific injustice perpetuauted by the majority of the members of the WTO. There is even a refreshing minority of WTO attendees with good agendas in the movie, something I didn't expect and was glad to see.  This movie really covers all the bases!  I would give things away if I said anymore (apologies if I already said too much).  I highly recommend this movie.  After I rented it from the neighborhood video store, I bought it on Amazon immmediately.  Enjoy!",1248912000,4,2396,4.883374689826303
3729043,4,B001O5LVVM,"Coming from Seattle, having lived through the WTO protests, I am proud S. Townsend took this topic to task.  Townsend is a sweetheart and brave soul to care about the impact this event had on our city, and the world at large.  Thank you for coming here and creating this film!  It is well done, and I'm gratified by much of the original network news footage as well as the storyline.

This film will speak to young Americans just coming to understand how our economics impact the planet.  Some characters may seem cheesy, but I found them to be authentic, easy to identify with for the most part.  Yes, many people were tear-gassed and beaten in the streets for peaceful protesting.  Yes, this went for 3 solid days, here in the heart of Seattle.  Yes, I had a friend sleeping on my couch for a few nights, since he couldn't SEE after being tear-gassed.  Yes, some children were tear-gassed, walking as pedestrians with their parents down the street.  Yes, the city was under curfew and citizens were told to stay in their homes.  And yes, the streets of our city were completely ripped-up.  All the shop windows were kicked in and...  Well, it all had an interesting way of addressing our materialism!  Just in time for the Christmas shopping season.  YAY!

(Seattle has not been the same since.)

What makes this film important is, it does give some human documentation to the FIRST international protest which was ever organized on the internet.

Into the third day of protests, media attempted to keep national news reports on the down-low; we had to tune-in to PBS in order to find out what was happening.  For many, it represents the beginning of the needed CHANGE we were to strive for - - coming into nine long years later! After the events of 9/11, the war in Iraq, and with the election of Barack Obama.  The true-life story behind this film shows us how hard-earned change can be; that it does not happen overnight.  It happens in small revolutions of people, coming together with united intention.

As America falls into a recession which affects all nations, globally, and as we continue to work at pulling ourselves out of the wars in the Middle East, this film is an important, informative way to educate yourself on our global economic issues and the needs for change.  If you're without a job right now, see if you can rent this film and think about the possibility of going to work for PEACE.  If you need a little inspiration about root networks? And why it is that going green can help us in the future?  This film and the true-life stories behind it will show you the way.",1242432000,10,2593,4.584782608695652
3729044,5,B001O5LVVM,"This was one of the best films I saw in 2008 (yes, I was lucky to be at one of 2 screenings in Los Angeles).  Frankly, it was better than any of the Oscar nominated Best Films. It's well-shot, well-acted, well-researched (as I understand it, the factual basis is completely accurate) and well-written.  What's amazing is that though the writer-director is a well-established Irish actor, this is the first film he has made. The film is very much an ensemble work, weaving a tapestry of all the players in the Seattle riots (politicians, cops, activists, by-standers).  What I particularly liked about this film was just how fair it was to everybody. Nobody is a villain even when they do very bad things (the cops, the mayor). There are very real motivations... people had the best of intentions. It's a complex portrait - nothing like the media coverage given to us. It's a completely entertaining movie, but it's an important film as well.  I think this is a movie every patriotic American should see, and by patriotic, I mean those who believe in the U.S. Constitution. But it was financed by a Canadian and had no major studio distribution so thus, nobody knew about it.",1241568000,14,1174,4.740196078431373
3729045,1,B001O5LVVM,"I wanted to see this movie because I was living and working in downtown Seattle at the time of these events. I was able to watch a lot of the protests unfold from my office window, and walked through the protests on my way to and from work. I won't quibble with some of the historical inaccuracies - hey, that's movie-making.

But I did want to point out that this is like some bad war movie from the 40's or 50's -- just a bunch of pot cliches and paper-thin characters strung together to try to make a movie out of a very interesting historical event: Angry cop. Pregnant wife. Overwhelmed mayor. Heroic young protesters, debating over who is more courageous and idealistic.

I did enjoy the way they edited in some actual historic footage. Otherwise, this was more like watching someone's film-school mid-term project than an actual commercial movie release. It would have been better if they would have twisted the facts more, and had some UFO's blast downtown Seattle with laser beams or something.",1239494400,12,1003,4.693181818181818
3729046,5,B001O5LVVM,"Having been in the street at a number of such protests and having had many close friends who were there that day in Seattle, I have to say that as a hollywood dramatization, this is a fine example of historical movie-making.  No historical dramatization is accurate in every detail, since some details have to be sacrificed to streamline artistic expression, yet this movie is certainly accurate in spirit, and touches well on a number of realities of those days.  It also does a good job of capturing the spirit of that protest without demonizing the opposition.  It is sure to inspire questioning, dialogue and (hopefully) heroism in those who watch it.  Also a timely release, given our current world economic situation.  A gift to the coming generation, for sure...I hope it's watched in every High school social science classroom in America.",1239321600,4,846,4.971631205673759
3729047,4,B001O5LVVM,"Years ago, TIME magazine had a cover article on the ""Battle in Seattle.""  In the article, TIME had a map of downtown Seattle that marked certain high rise buildings.  The building in which I worked every day was starred as ""Ground Zero"" for the Battle.  When I watched the movie, it brought back my hassles of getting to and from work over the four demonstration days.  Although I was in the midst of all the action, I didn't really understand the Battle in Seattle until I watched this movie.  If you buy the DVD, as I did, be sure to watch the bonus features.  One of the bonus features explains why the subject matter was chosen, how it was perceived by the writer and director, and most importantly, it explains very well the WHY of the Battle.  I highly recommend the movie.  I took one star off of my review because one of the characters was a shallow one played by an actress that didn't do a convincing job with the material she was given.",1239235200,8,947,4.371428571428571
3729048,1,B001O5LVVM,"I had read the book a few weeks before seeing the movie (yes, there is an actual book). The movie was nothing like the book and I didn't really learn much from watching the movie.  My husband and I were bored during it. The governor didn't seem any thing like Gary Locke except that he was Chinese.  He was a very angry fella.  The subplot with the pregnant woman was not mentioned as I recall in the book, so I guess they just felt they needed to add this.  Lots of fu-- swear words didn't make the movie any more appealing and I don't remember any swear words in the book. All in all the movie did not capture the spirit of the passionate people who were involved in fighting the WTO and in portraying all of the planning that went into this.",1238371200,8,744,4.181818181818182

Their mistake is your gain because ""Battle In Seattle"" is one of the best independent films in years, and certainly the best value for your entertainment dollar. Director Stuart Townsend handles the complex story and large cast with skill betraying his inexperience in this role.  While some moments are choppy and some scenes so active that it can be hard to follow the primary action, the overall effect is superb and well worth watching.",1231545600,4,708,5.042735042735043
