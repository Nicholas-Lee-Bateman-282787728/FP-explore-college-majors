4435838,1,B004NIVVE4,"I love Cake Boss and other shows of this type, but this one.... OMG it is SO scripted, I don't think there is more than 2 candid moments in each episode. I finally quit watching at episode 5... I can't bear another minute of the fake, scripted dialogue.",1352937600,6,253,4.291666666666667
4435839,5,B004NIVVE4,DC Cupcakes is a fantastic show.  I love how the family network and supports is highlighted with the show.  Fun & Interesting!,1392422400,,126,4.681818181818182

4435842,5,B004NIVVE4,I love this show :-) much. I love how Katherine and sophie get along so well. With my sister's we fight mostly every day so I'm glad they are good with each other. Mommy is so funny but she gets to confused but........ it's so funny. Some people think that the signature swirl is just stupid and their wrong because it is awesome that they make their cup and identical. I can't wait for new episodes.,1388880000,,400,4.276315789473684

4435844,1,B004NIVVE4,"I can't believe this is even a show. The individual cupcakes that they make are pretty, but their big projects are not deserving of a show.",1380672000,2,139,4.384615384615385
4435845,5,B004NIVVE4,I like cupcakes and I love that show because it is really fun to be watching it. I love it!!!,1379548800,,93,3.7
4435846,5,B004NIVVE4,"It is such a pleasure to watch this show.  I am constantly amazed at the team work, effort and thought that goes into every project they create.  This is definitely a family show anyone would enjoy even if you're not a ""baker.""  The artistic and engineering skills that go into these projects are amazing!!  In each episode you get to see start to finish, you'll be ""hooked"" within the first 5 minutes of watching.",1378512000,3,414,4.554054054054054
4435847,5,B004NIVVE4,It's hilarious to see the situations they get into. My daughter loves the show! Good for family entertainment.  Motivated us to make new and variety of cupcakes.,1375574400,,161,4.962962962962963
4435848,3,B004NIVVE4,Good reality show. If you feel hungry for cupcakes after watching this then it has succeed its purpose. Safe sugar rush for all.,1373155200,3,128,4.608695652173913
4435849,5,B004NIVVE4,I personally didn't watch this program but my 6 yr old grand daughter did and she loves it so I gave it an excellent rating,1373155200,,123,3.96
4435850,5,B004NIVVE4,I chose this rating because I love baking cupcakes and now when I grow up I want be a cupcake maker. Plus the show is alsome.,1371081600,2,125,3.8461538461538463
4435851,2,B004NIVVE4,I don't watch shows like this. I try to watch with my daughter and just can't. (four more words required),1368230400,2,105,4.3
4435852,5,B004NIVVE4,"I love the show because like stuff like this.  They seem a little stiff and unnatural the was they talk, in the sense that talking for the camera and not just casual.  And Mommy drives me crazy but maybe to much like my mom.  Idk. Just my opinions",1366848000,,247,4.104166666666667
4435853,3,B004NIVVE4,"I guess after falling in love with Cake Boss and Next Great Baker, these 2 seem a little lame in the series.  They just don't seem like this is all ""natural.""  Like the caramel missing from the caramel cupcake tray - really?  How scripted was THAT?  Texting the BF while tending ganache?  Don't think it would naturally catch fire like that....Won't be watching any more of these.",1365465600,,380,4.611940298507463
4435854,1,B004NIVVE4,"I have yet to finish one single episode.  It's so boring.  The blonde haired lady is so bossy in an annoying way, and I can't stand in one episode where both owners were mixing red velvet cake mix, while the blonde lady called over to another employee to get an ingredient.  Really?  She can't stop talking for 2 seconds and get the ingredient herself?  They also try too hard to create drama and claim how busy they are at their shop.  Cake Boss is a much better show.",1364515200,4,469,4.2727272727272725
4435855,4,B004NIVVE4,"I will watch almost any cooking show, particularly now that I only watch shows on the Internet.  There aren't that many to choose from.  That said, the ladies bring a fresh take to the overall Reality TV baking show.  Their personalities are bright and fresh, not polished TV personae. I don't find their artistic creations to be that impressive, though watching people bake is mesmerizing to me.  I love to watch how they pull it all together, even if the final product lacks finesse.

That said, the mini dramas that occur in each episode are so contrived.  Here is where their unfamiliarity with the camera really comes through.  It's very obvious, the times they are attempting to follow a script and just don't have the ease of doing so.  It comes across very stilted.  It's too bad, because the girls clearly have a good working relationship between themselves and their staff.  I think they could put together a successful show without all of the forced scenarios and interpersonal explosions.",1364083200,2,1000,4.863905325443787
4435856,5,B004NIVVE4,My five year old watches this show almost daily. She loves it. It shows how you can accomplish working together and yet be successful in stressful situations but yet have fun.,1360454400,2,175,4.67741935483871
4435857,5,B004NIVVE4,i love that the two sisters work together and bring in their family  members to help them to create these fun cupcake themes!!!  i have never seen cupcakes like these before!  waiting for more episodes to see what else creations they have !!!!!,1360454400,,244,4.627906976744186
4435858,5,B004NIVVE4,"I LOVE this show!  I can't wait for new episodes to be available.  My kids love watching this show with me.  Katherine and Sophie are funny and real and it's just a fun, entertaining show to watch.  Their cupcakes are amazing and it's fun to watch the show and get a behind the scenes look on how they do it all.",1359072000,,312,4.065573770491803
8436637,4,B004NIVVE4,good entertainment,1454198400,,18,8.5
8436638,5,B004NIVVE4,They need to publish more seasons.,1422835200,,34,4.833333333333333
8436639,4,B004NIVVE4,my daughter really likes watching this,1421971200,,38,5.5
8436640,5,B004NIVVE4,These two sister's and their Mother are very entertaining. Typical siblings,1418428800,,75,5.909090909090909
8436641,5,B004NIVVE4,Great,1417996800,,5,5.0
8436642,1,B004NIVVE4,"I was done with this show from the first episode, where they built a base for their Mardi Gras cupcake display that was too big to fit through their door, so they couldn't get it out of the shop. Really? How stupid can you be not to make sure that the base for your display fits through your damned door? And then, adding insult to injury, what did they do to get the display out the door? Tilt it a bit? Why no, that would be too easy, and might damage our precious cupcakes. No, they essentially let a worker destroy the door. On a vintage DC building. Yeah...just tear up the door that's been there for a hundred years or more so we can get our stupid cupcakes out because we didn't bother to measure. Dumb. I turned it off right then, and I won't be turning it on again.",1403136000,,774,4.132450331125828
8436643,5,B004NIVVE4,"I have a new love, making delicious little cupcakes to make my staff happy. I was happy to find a show that was inspiring me while I am exploring this new hobby. I would love to do what they do and I've learned enough through the show to see the good and bad. It would be pretty boring if it wasn't scripted some and I think that is fine, it's a TV show not a creepy spy cam. After streaming all of the episodes on a marathon level on my day off I did get a little bored with the same kind of fondant sculptured cupcake creations. I also never seen anyone eat any of those cupcakes so I'm curious to know if they are edible? I do understand though it's business and you need to go home at night too.  I have no doubt these girls worked through the night many times, That little scripted shot of them waking up under the table was nothing compared to the work they really put in day in and day out. I have a high respect for them and I think they are inspiring to many. I appreciate they are sharing their story of the american dream. I also love Sophie's cautiousness with Katherine's competitiveness, they are attributes that are the recipe for their success.",1395964800,,1160,4.201793721973094
8436644,3,B004NIVVE4,"Typical of ""reality"", TV a lot of attitudes and presumed drama.
I like how the sisters work together but it wierds me out for them to call their mother ""mommy"" at their age.
I like the ideas they have,  I guess the drama would be when they put everyone on the spot.",1393286400,2,265,4.096153846153846
8436645,1,B004NIVVE4,"I only watched this show for 5 minutes, and I could not only tell it was scripted, but they are trying too hard to make the dialogue look genuine and are trying to impress people on the private interviews. I mean seriously, what 20-30 year old woman still calls her mom ""mommy?"" And who would do that at a bakery? Honestly, this show is not worth your time, it's just too fake, and the girls try too hard to look professional.

Would not recommend",1392595200,,447,4.321428571428571
8436646,1,B004NIVVE4,"We all know reality shows can be scripted, but this show is blatant and borderline offensive with how predictable it is. In one episode they wake up underneath a table with both sisters laying on top of empty cupcake boxes,it's one of those ""wtf?"" Moments. If someone says this is a great show,they're clearly oblivious. This garbage makes you dislike cakes. This show is a waste of time,period.",1392508800,2,395,4.823529411764706
