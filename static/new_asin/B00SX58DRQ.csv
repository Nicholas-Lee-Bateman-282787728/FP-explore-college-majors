Being an icelander, interested in ous sagas, I must say that this DVD is amazing.
""The final battle of Gsli Srsson"" will give people very good insight in the viking age,
life in Iceland at the settlement age, and in to the icelandic sagas.
Dr. William R. Short's knowledge and passion for the sagas and for the battle technic
of the viking age is amazing.
I highly reccomend this video to all people who want to get an insight and understanding
in the sagas and the life in the viking age.

8699666,5,B00SX58DRQ,"As with the other Hurstwic Viking combat videos, the information is quite in depth, well-researched, and delivered in an entertaining form. Dr Short knows his subjects, both the viking-era combat and the Icelandic sagas and it is a treat to see both brought together in the actual setting where the tales happened a millennia ago.

For me, the real treat of this video was all the extras, from the tour of Icelandic battlefields to the talks on Viking clothing and weapons. Dr Short and his team have done it again and I eagerly await the next volume in the series!",1425686400,,565,4.65
