6599515,5,B00MQI46RW,"Not only did the DVDs arrive in a timely manner the packaging was exceptional.  Truly appreciated the level of service from the vendor in which I purchased all 3 documentaries in a box set at a great price.  About the Documentary itself...from the time that I seen the first one I knew that this was something I needed to add to my personal collection.  My family and I were able to engage in some serious dialogue per every topic.  What I liked most was that it wasn't your typical boring documentary...it was so well put together that it even held my 12 and 10 year old daughter's attention.  As an adult I knew so much had been left out of the text books used in school when I was coming up but to see their reactions to things they had recently learned in school that never made mention of what the learned from the movies reminded me of the importance of fully knowing OUR History!  I have since shared the DVD with friends looking forward to their reactions and the conversations, all of which ending with them saying...""Where can I purchase a copy of my own""!",1414368000,63,1066,4.413265306122449
6599516,5,B00MQI46RW,"All three volumes of Hidden Colors were very good.  As for my favorites, volumes 2 and 3 were bad to the bone!!!  Very informative documentary regarding the legacy of slavery and how it affects today's current events.",1414195200,24,217,4.837837837837838
6599517,5,B00MQI46RW,"I had these DVD's recommended to me by a family member, so I decided to purchase them. The vast amount of emotions I felt both while and after watching these DVD's was incredible! Sadness, anger, disbelief, happiness, etc. However, the one emotion that I was left with more than anything, was PRIDE! I have never felt such pride in being Black until after I watched these history lessons. Society has taught us that our history and pride as Black people started once we fought for our freedom from slavery. These documentaries though, illustrate brilliantly the enormous yet concealed contributions that Black people have made to World History and the things we as Blacks can do today to begin to turn things around.

An absolute must see for all people, especially for Black people!",1414195200,124,783,4.887218045112782
6599518,5,B00MQI46RW,"The documentary touches on parts of African History that few black people know about.

6599559,5,B00MQI46RW,"The African Diaspora does not start and stop in the ""African"" American community. All Africans should dig deeper. Thats including Continental Africans aka African Born peoples and Afro-Latinos, Afro-Carribeans, and more. They experienced the trade too. Thats why its also important to learn the difference between nationality/citizenship, culture, actual genetics and these created labels such as the social construct ""race"". For instance...black... is really African... there are so many shades, ethnic groups, and much more. Just like Europeans and Asians know they are Irish/Italian/British or Chinese/Korean/Japanese... ""Blacks"" should also dig to know if you are Ghanian/Nigerian/Congo.. and so many others. Thanks to advanced technology the information is out there. Keep researching and researching and be happy for the self-love. So no matter where... it does not stop your genetics from being an ""Australian"" Aboriginal, European, Asian, and yes African. There are 100% Africans with very light skin right on the Continent. The more we read and wake up the more unity and understanding. Love all",1494720000,,1104,5.696969696969697

The professors and scholars in this series is wonderful and diverse in the collective information that was shared.

6599573,5,B00MQI46RW,"Having lectured on the contents of these DVDs for many years, and having written about the accomplishments of African people throughout history, from the beginning of time, I am so humbled, and extremely grateful finally, for the inclusion of our peoples' history in the marketplace. I am beginning to feel avenged for the exclusion of our history from textbooks, and world history. I appreciate and congratulate all of the contributors to this project for opening the eyes of everyone willing to view the truth. The truth will always rise to the surface. That has been proven throughout time whenever evil has tried to reign. ""What goes into the wash, will come out in the rinse"". The rinsing is now prevalent.  Thank you Tariq Nasheed and all of the contributors for your efforts in creating an outstanding presentation.  BRAVO!!!

You have to admit it's hard to look back at the savage acts humanity done especially the Caucasian.

Good advice is to not look everything in just white vs black since the deeper you go.  You will realized there is also a bloodline quarrel within the dark skin race. (Nodding at Sons of Ham(Chem) and Sons of Shem: there is truth in the Tanak/Old testaments).

In volume 2 and 3 when it touched on the crimes done in the name of racism. All I have to say is Deuteronomy/Debarim 28:68 for the black people from Shem bloodline. Blame your ancestors for not taking the covenant seriously.",1476835200,2,779,4.589928057553957

It shows that our educational system in America is falling short of telling the TRUTH about History as I it pertains to African-American people and people of color. I feel that up until now, I was in a deep comma like sleep, but after watching this documentary I am now WIDE AWAKE and I don't see anything in my life the same any more. Again, this was an EXCELLENT documentary, and I urge everyone who is unaware of the TRUTH about African-American people and people of color and the game that has been, and is being played, should watch this, and urge all of their friends and family to watch it as well.

6599802,2,B00MQI46RW,"I heard about these DVD's and decided to buy them, since the bundle was pretty affordable! I waned to see what the ""hype"" was and possible learn some things. It took me a while to actually watch them (well the first one and a little of the second one) and I'm not impressed.

The thing about extraordinary claims is that they require extraordinary proof; this documents makes some pretty wild claims, most of them based on Europeans/White people covering up the truth. My questions is, if all this information was so called ""hidden"", how the hell did they find out what happened?! I don't know if me graduating with my Masters 3 months ago makes me sensitive when it comes to research, but this bugged me!

This documentary provides absolutely ZERO facts based on truth. We never hear how they learn this information and who from. There are parts where people talk about conversations Michelangelo had with his supervisor (the painter) with him saying the saints weren't White, but Black. Ummm...has anyone ever heard of the game telephone? A message can be distorted after being passed through 20 people; are we supposed to believe this conversation can trump THAT, plus a couple centuries?!

This series also rang with homophobia, slut-shaming and down-laying of the women's rights movement. The creator of this documentaries was so full of it and said, at one point, that Blacks didn't need to address Black women problems in society, because they were focused on something more important.

Uh, what?

Just, no. Find a researched book by a reputable person, not a bunch of jaded people who are upset their research wasn't taken seriously by the White people they hate, but secretly seek approval from.",1427328000,11,1704,4.902777777777778

6599821,5,B00MQI46RW,I am much more inclined to believe this picture of history than the ridiculous one excreted in public schools these days. This movie makes several good points but it doesn't mean it's got to be the absolute and only truth. Seems to only point out the mistreatment of Africans mostly or dark skinned people in general. Us white folks didn't care about your skin color back then. We screwed everyone over! Definitely worth looking more into. Very well put together for as much information as it contains.

Black people seem to not know their identity but once we can tell our untold story, our black community can rise, prosper and know that they have always been here and will always be here as long as we all work together.
