8226890,5,B000X4N84I,"Global Warming or Global Governance draws on the opinions of a number of experts including one lead scientific author with the IPCC, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and one reviewer with the IPCC.  There are a number of other science experts including Robert Balling of the University of Arizona and Tim Patterson at Carlton University in Canada.

The film runs 1 hour and 22 minutes and so far I have found the first 50 minutes very impressive.  Science is presented in layman's terms to explain why man is not the cause of global warming and that greenhouse gases in fact are not responsible for the warming we see.  The film makes a good case for why the sun drives a lot of the heating thought to be due to CO2 -  not a surprise.  Also,  facts from the hurricane center show that we have not gone through a particularly high incidence of hurricanes lately, in fact, lately we have been probably returning to pre -1950s levels.

The ""facts"" presented by Al Gore and other alarmists are pretty selective as the film demonstrates.  Gore and others present what can be termed advocacy science.  They make alarmist statements, as Dr. Robert Balling points out, and then go out into the real world to try to find data to back up their view, all the while being very selective in the data they present.

The film presents why the Michael Mann ""hockey stick"" graph has been discredited.  It purportedly showed that we live in a time of an exceptionally high temperature increase, unprecidented in history.  We are shown why Mann's data was flawed, and we are given historical data that shows that the earth's temperature was warmer than today 1000 years ago during the Medieval period (It was also warmer 5000 years ago].  One Thousand years ago, exceptional warming occurred on Greenland allowing the Vikings to settle there.  They only left there when Greenland grew cold again.  It is melting again today.  But, here's the point: if man-made CO2 causes melting on Greenland today, what caused melting there 1000 years ago?  Anyway the IPCC has dropped Mann's ""hockey stick"" graph even though Gore and others continue to use it.

I am showing the DVD to my environmental science class and we are getting a lot of useful information out it.

Well, I will let the viewer make up his or her own mind.  It is a very worthwhile film and I highly recommend it.",1328400000,3,2370,4.690072639225182
8226891,1,B000X4N84I,"This movie is brought to you from Michael Coffman, Sovereignty International, and Exploration Films.

Coffman was a spokesperson for the Paper Industry, and is currently President of so-called Environmental Perspectives, Inc. (EPI), and Executive Director of Sovereignty International. EPI focuses on providing guidance based on Judeo-Christian principles. Sovereignty International brings a message of how national sovereignty, free market enterprise, private property rights, and traditional values are superior to global treaties and agreements. (from their own websites)

Exploration Films is a self-proclaimed Christian website that obfuscates science by imposing a creationist view on legitimate research.

The film starts with the premise that freedom to pollute is inviolate, and that anyone who disagrees must be an enemy of freedom in general.  Then it proposes that the scientific facts of global warming must be at fault because some deniers assume that the evidence makes restrictive non-Christian global dominance mandatory.  In actuality, unrestrained greed dominates and corrupts them.

It would be better if it explored ways to free Christians from the dominance of godless corporate profiteers set on plundering God's Creation for their own short-term, selfish motives.  Freedom of religion must include freedom from dominance by ruthless, cut-throats who will sell our future for a dollar.  After all, isn't that why Jesus supposedly overturned the money-changers' tables in the temple?",1328140800,7,1505,5.935185185185185
8226892,5,B000X4N84I,"I never realized how pressing an issue this was until I was able to see this film for myself. I also recommended ""the great global warming swindle"" to watch along with this.",1295049600,3,173,4.4375
8226893,5,B000X4N84I,"Listening to these clearly presented arguments one should be easily convinced, that the world are being duped into a very frightful lie.

For example, the massaged data used in the infamous politically charged hockey-stick debate is selectively presented to cause alarm, the historic data being hidden. Also, CO2 levels follow temperature fluctuations, as proven by the ice core samples, not the other way around, super-impose the graphs and see for yourself! Scientists who object are marginalized and they are not included in the so-called 'consensus', do not get funding as their research is not biased toward promoting the global warming political platform. Global Warming has become a religion and woe to you if you do not agree. Seems to me that we are back in the dark Middle Ages when people would believe any nonsense told to them. (Lately, it was renamed to Climate Change, as it is now clear that we are in a cooling phase.) The most important greenhouse gas is water vapour, shall we get rid of that too?

Watch this dvd, the political agenda to unite all under global government via financial collapse and especially the global warming agenda is pretty obvious and alarming. Well done to the contributors to this informative work.",1257465600,3,1243,5.0
8226894,5,B000X4N84I,"The first review here (G. Johnson) provides a good brief summary, but according to the film, it isn't just the Marxists that are pushing the global governance agenda. The film explains the drive, by powerful people, toward a New World Order based on feudalism; where they'll no longer need to concern themselves with democracy. The commentary is not wild or bizarre. Very down to earth - fits the facts as they actually are.",1199232000,19,424,4.821917808219178

Don't some people and/or their views get right up your nose?

#FIRSTLY, there are those who bravely fly in the face of popular political, press and public opinion. And for this I applaud both the makers of this DVD release and the appearances in it of those who swim against the tide of the rotten filth that is being spoon fed to the gullible masses of humanity. Indeed, why don't some people think things through for themselves with clarity and sobriety? For example, have you ever noticed just how one-sided the global warming argument is from almost every form of man made communication? All other views appear to be wrong, irrelevant ignored or heretical. But remember this, that there is NOT an overwhelming consensus of opinion (as the global warming brainwashers would have us believe), as this documentary clearly shows us. A reason for the 'anti global warming' gag is revealed when the documentary describes to us a hidden global agenda.  Again, in the documentary 'The Great Global Warming Swindle', it is explained to us in general terms just WHO is involved in the creation of the reports that are churned out by the IPCC, and what levels of expertise in a particular field the contributors may or apparently may not be suitably qualified in. And here in the GWGG documentary we discover in specific terms exactly HOW those reports are constructed. Anyone with an honourable conscience should be both appalled and alarmed by the modus operandi of this politically driven, government sponsored and corrupt organization.

#SECONDLY, there are those who sadly are perhaps either unwilling, unable, stiff necked, arrogant or morally dishonest in their opposition to plain and sensible facts regarding the current man made global warming fallacy -and sadly there are plenty of them around. For this reason many will choke on the ""Unequivocal"" [an IPCC/Gore buzzword] evidence that is presented in this rather excellent documentary.

#THIRDLY, - Fact 1. the Norsemen [Vikings] did not migrate to Greenland and enjoy the good weather there as a result of 'Man made' global warming. Fact 2. At the present time Australia is suffering its worst drought in over a hundred years, but obviously 'man made' global warming could not possibly have caused the previous one. Fact 3. Apparently, Australia is one of the world's hottest, driest continents. Fact 4. believe it or not but living as I do on the North East coast of England right beside the North sea, we over here are currently experiencing 'global cooling', with not even a hint of warming anywhere - but then, this has been the case for a number of centuries over here at this time of year. Perhaps the IPCC will come and turn up the heat for us?

#LASTLY, for those of you who are wondering why Amazon removed the title from its store, and would like a copy of GWGG, the address on the World Wide Web can be found when you join all the words of the DVD title together but remove the word 'or'[and don't forget the dot and the com]. Alternatively - have a root around the World Wide Web for americanvision where it is listed in their top ten products. I would also recommend the global warming swindle DVD as a good companion to this.

It is not unlikely that the contents of this review will irritate a plethora of people. No doubt it will probably get a lot of 'unhelpful' hits, particularly by those whose attitudes I have described in my 'second' point. But really friends, I for one could not care less just how far up other peoples proverbial noses the GWSwindle, GWGG and me may or may not get. Like you the reader, I too only desire the unadulterated truth.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Global-Warming-Swindle-DVD/dp/B000WLUXZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Global Warming Swindle (DVD)</a>",1196035200,45,3888,5.0941915227629515
8226896,5,B000X4N84I,"Everybody who is in his right mind can see that man-made global warming is a sham. The only question to ask is ""cui bono?"" - who does it benefit? So many excellent scientist have already spoken up to clarify this whole swindle - but almost nobody publishes them. We have become helpless against those who are in charge of the media and of the ""published opinion"". Why doesn't Amazon sell this DVD new? Too much pressure from the pesudo-environmentalist mafia?",1195171200,41,459,4.75
