8311089,3,B001ILFUPK,"I bought this because I'm a huge fan of Jim Nichols, and any chance to hear him play is worth the money.  This DVD appears to be a follow-up of an earlier video called 'World of Fingerstyle Jazz Guitar' which featured him and four other players including Martin Taylor.  The similarities end there.  While the performances are excellent, the setting and production values are about as low budget and cheesy as they get.  No effort at creating a backdrop has been made here we're watching these guys perform in somebody's living room.  And the interview at the end?  Totally unnecessary and awkward.  Buy it for the stellar performances of Jim Nichols and Craig Wagner, but be prepared to cringe at the lack of production values.",1427241600,,728,4.776
