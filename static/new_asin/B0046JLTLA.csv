4270156,2,B0046JLTLA,"From the director of ""Soul Plane"" Jessy Terrero and the hip hop star Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson comes ""GUN"", a 2010 independent film which showcases 50 Cent not only as an actor but the main screenwriter for the film.

VIDEO:

""GUN"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:35:1).  I wish there was special features included because the picture quality has this look of overcast (it was shot during the Winter time) and looks a bit desaturated at times.  But for the most part, it fits with the film.  Black levels are deep, I didn't see any artifacting or banding.  But overall, if the desaturated look was intended by cinematographer Zeus Morand, then I can say that ""GUN"" looks good on Blu-ray.

Considering this is a low-budget film, ""GUN"" looks good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""GUN"" sports an English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  While the majority of the film is dialogue and music-driven through the center, front and even surround channels, possibly the best part is how the gun battles were used.  Although the film is not action-driven throughout the film, there are scenes were rifle shots, gun shots come out with excellent clarity.  Even scenes where Fifty Cent keeps hitting a man between legs with a baseball bat, the crunching sounds and the visual of that scene literally makes you cringe.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""GUN"" does not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Hip hop star 50 Cent makes his debut as a screenwriter for his latest film ""GUN"", which he produced and stars in.  While his heart was in the right place in capturing arms deals, this low-budget film is hampered by plot holes, utilization of characters and overall execution.  Otherwise, if you are a fan of Fifty Cent, Val Kilmer or the stars in this film, give it a chance.

But with a film shot under $3 million, it was an ambitious film and there's only so much you can do.

In an interview for ""GUN"", Fifty Cent said. ""Initially when I started the plot, it was a socially conscious story about how guns go from the manufacturing point to retail and purchased by law-abiding citizens and how they fall into the wrong hands. And what made it interesting and so relevant...was the fact that companies like Smith & Wesson are up 125 percent in sales in the middle of a recession.""

For gun enthusiasts, I'll give 50 Cent credit because he knows the streets, he knows how things are done.  But the problem lies in execution.  The Detroit police department are shown as weak, that the mayor is so impatient that he brings two members of the ATF to shake things up and get things done.

While the police are complaining that they don't have anything on Rich, the things that comes out of Detective Rogers' (played by James Remar) lips are unbelievable and once again, he and his force look so weak, you just feel sorry for them as they seem like a small town police force trying to take down big city players.

I felt that Fifty Cent at least did a good job playing Rich but the others...  Val Kilmer was good but somehow when we start to learn more about him, that cool and collected man suddenly changes to become something less.  I don't know how to explain it but he goes from a man that can easily put a bullet in someones head to later become a man who starts to whimper.  But I think the biggest thing that will shock people about ""GUN"" is seeing the once sexy Val Kilmer that people remember from ""Top Gun"", ""Willow"", ""Heat"" or ""Batman Forever"" having changed a lot physically since those films and has gained a lot of weight and unfortunately, his acting is all over the place for this film.  I have seen better acting from Val Kilmer and this film was not one of them.

Both actors Danny Trejo (""Machete"", ""xXx""), LaLa Vasquez (""You Got Served""), John Larroquette (""Night Court"", ""Boston Legal"") are limited to short roles and unfortunately, we barely see Danny Trejo doing anything major shooting, LaLa Vasquez is just a person who works at a restaurant and John Larroquette plays the man who is supplying the weaponry is only shown at the end and unfortunately, because of that, there is no major impact to the end of the film.

The film also stars ""90210' sexy vixen AnnaLynne McCord who plays Rich's girlfriend and the go-between between Rich and the weaponry suppliers.  Although she can do sex scenes with 50 Cent, her character as the go-between for weaponry, just didn't seem right.

This week I had a chance to review T.I.'s ""Takers"" and now Fifty Cent's ""GUN"".  Two hip hop stars trying to make it big in live action films as a producer and an actor and one thing that T.I. did right with his film is align himself with people to make sure the writing is top notch.  For ""GUN"", I wonder if anyone even gave Fifty Cent constructive criticism to make some changes to the screenplay.  I felt that Fifty Cent's heart was in the right place for the screenplay, but the overall execution was hurt by bad acting, storyline structure and a lackluster Blu-ray release.

This Blu-ray release should have had some form of special features which sometimes helps enhance our movie watching experience, may it be a commentary or making of, this would have been a great film for Fifty Cent to talk about the screenwriting process and such.  But nothing was included.

During the screening of the film back in December (and reported on the The Grand Rapids Press), Fifty Cent told the audience before the film, ""I'm a work in progress.  I'll be better tomorrow than I am today.""

""GUN"" is one of the three films that 50 Cent has written and I just hope that by the second film, what he learned from the making of this film as a producer, writer and actor shows improvement for his next film.  We all live and learn from our experiences and although ""GUN"" is not a good film, nor is it a good Blu-ray release, I look forward to see how he improves in the future.",1296259200,,5930,4.596958174904943
4270157,3,B0046JLTLA,"This is a warning: the title of Gun (50 Cent) is LOCKED on 'A'. This would mean for those in the UK or for those in Australia as it won't play and this is even though on the cover it says 'ABC' for region free. Well, the film not bad, only average and what do expect from a lame actor by the name of Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson.",1295222400,,325,3.7941176470588234
4270158,3,B0046JLTLA,"I've not watched the numerous films that rap artists Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson has made to date. As a matter of fact I think TWELVE was actually the first thing I'd seen him in. With the number of rap stars crossing over into films it never seems like they stretch much, almost always portraying thugs or drug dealers and the like. On rate occasion a few have made memorable performances but, like rap music, those that make a lasting impression are few and far between.

The same can't be said of Jackson. Sure, his characters might be street wise but there is more depth to them than can be found in most exploitation films. And this film, while the slim plot might make one think it qualifies for that genre, is actually better than one would expect.

Jackson stars as Rich, a young street punk who's out to make a name for himself in the world of gun running. The film opens with Rich and his crew tricking his competition into running from a club only to be caught in a hail of bullets. With this group gone, Rich is now the top dog in the world of gun running in Detroit.

Moving forward we get to see Angel (Val Kilmer) released from prison. His story is yet unclear to us, but he moves into a room and soon finds his way to Rich. The two have a history where Angel once saved Rich from certain death. He asks Rich for a gun which he is more than happy to provide. A few days later he returns to take Rich up on an offer to join his crew.

As these two stories merge a third part of the puzzle appears in the persona of Detective Rogers (James Remar), a veteran cop on the force who has made his single most important goal to shut down the gun runners in his town. Saddled with a pair of hot shot ATF agents who seem more intent on ridiculing him than in helping, Rogers trudges along following the leads which eventually take him to Rich.

As the film moves along we discover that Rich has made a connection with a powerful organization that can supply him with more guns than he could ever imagine. His connection is a beautiful woman named Gabriella (AnnaLynee McCord) who seems as interested in bedding down Rich as she does in establishing him with her bosses.

While each of these items comes together there is still something missing, some piece that we are yet unaware of that connects them all together. And this missing piece is the one part of this film that makes it rise above the common street thug films that usually arrive straight to DVD. I won't spoil it and some of you may figure it out long before the final reel, but it does offer something that for many will be unexpected.

The film was written by Jackson, another plus that makes it a bit more ambitious than most. He does a good job here providing realistic characters that might on occasion fall back on the usual stereotypes but for the most part seem true to the story. The dialogue doesn't rank with that of say Kevin Smith, but it flows naturally and is delivered by a cast that treats it like Shakespeare rather than a dime store direct to DVD feature.

I doubt that this film will come close to Oscar consideration but it does offer a solid story, entertainment for fans of the genre and some good performances. Kilmer, an actor who started strong and lately has become a staple of direct to DVD films, always turns in a performance that exceeds the material he is given. Who knows why Hollywood has seemed to shun him when it comes to major studio releases? Whatever the reason, he raises the quality of the films he stars in. And this is one that rises to meet his achievement on its own merits.",1295222400,,3586,4.357784431137724
4270159,1,B0046JLTLA,I am a huge 50 cent fan and was very excited to buy and watch this film. You get the feeling that you missed the first hour of the movie from the get go. There are a ton of plot holes leaving you to just assume you know whats going on. The script does not allow you to get close to any characeter so you really don't care about any of there fates making the movie pointless. It had potential to be a good movie if they would have let the story develop and not rush into all the action. I am very sorry to say that this movie is not worth your valuable time and it sucks!,1294790400,,570,3.8389830508474576
4270160,5,B0046JLTLA,"i don't know why people always hate on 50's acting... he is so much better then other rapper actors that i have seen lately like TI.  I actually enjoyed this movie.  If anyone else wants another CRIME movie with 50 in it, check out the movie twelve. Val kilmer and 50 make a pretty good pair in this movie.",1294617600,,306,4.169491525423729
4270161,1,B0046JLTLA,I simply cannot support this pile of trash movie since it features 50 Cent who shamelessly pumped a stock over twitter this past weekend.  This guy should be ashamed of himself.  Anything to make a buck... his name is 50 Cent because he will step on anyone to make a couple of quarters it seems.,1294617600,,295,4.345454545454546
4270162,3,B0046JLTLA,"Police in Detroit are looking for a stolen revolver used in a murder a few years ago.  Rich (Jackson) and Angel (Kilmer) are crime partners involved with the distribution of arms.  Overall better then I expected it to be, (50 Cent wrote it).  We find out pretty early that Rich is the one with the revolver and from then on it gets pretty predictable.  For the type of movie it is, I will give it a 6 out of 10, but don't let that deceive you, it's better then Streets of Blood (the last Jackson and Kilmer movie) but thats not saying a whole lot.  If you are looking for a top notch, exciting action flic I'd go with A-Team over this one.  I will say that this is Kilmer's best movie in awhile, which again isn't saying a whole lot.  I give it a C+.",1294272000,4,750,4.095890410958904
4270163,5,B0046JLTLA,"I really enjoyed the movie.  If you're a fan of guns or not, but like action--this is a great movie.  Glad to see Val K in the movie.",1293494400,,133,3.7142857142857144

4270165,5,B0046JLTLA,Great movie! Had my doubts about 50 cents acting ability but he did a phenominal job with his character.  Instant classic if you like this genre.,1428364800,,145,4.576923076923077
4270166,5,B0046JLTLA,Killa badass movie right here! Had no idea what Val Kilmer and 50 Cent would be like together,1420156800,,93,4.222222222222222

4270168,2,B0046JLTLA,"Pure gratuitous violence, language, really not much of a plot. Just seemed to be a vehicle for blood and revenge. No redemptive qualities at all.",1385856000,,145,4.84
4270169,5,B0046JLTLA,Another action packed well worth seeing movie with 50 Cent he's in his own element!! Not a lot of acting his just being himself!!!,1362182400,,130,4.458333333333333
4270170,1,B0046JLTLA,"Omg this movie sucked balls, the plot was pointless and the lack of action. . .I fell asleep twice trying to watch it! Its really that bad, val kilmer you really fell off making this movie, please please stop making this striaght to dvd bull(bleep)!",1325894400,,249,4.555555555555555
4270171,3,B0046JLTLA,"Good movie but after a while it gets tiring. There is alot of mf language{ which is typical considering where its comming from} Shooting,explosions bi racial sex scenes which turns people on others throw up. While i watched this i found it entertaining but not academy material. ENJOY  but don't expect too much.",1307404800,,312,4.886792452830188
4270172,4,B0046JLTLA,"The story line is simple. They are looking for a stolen revolver used in a murder. I saw it as creating a STONE COLD KILLER looking for revenge for the killing of his wife while being forced to help the police. The main action involved a police captain forcing our ""hero"" to become a snitch.  To do this he had to risk his life to prevent the captain from framing him sending him to jail and not being united with his daughter. There is definitely more killing than a Stallone movie but the action is exciting and I like the ending. .",1303344000,,534,4.235294117647059

its more about runin guns then gangs
did not like Val Kilmer in it

must see if you like 50 cent",1302220800,,131,3.6785714285714284
4270174,3,B0046JLTLA,"The movie was written, produced, and starred Curtis 50 cents Jackson as a Detroit gun dealer. In the first scene there is a strip joint with pole dancers who keep their clothes on. A hit is done outside the joint as Jackson kills his competition in the drug trade. The Mexican Cartels need lots of high powered guns, which Jackson claims he will provide. His connection is the pretty Annalynne McCord who also has sex with Jackson, the author of the script. Meanwhile Val Kilmer is being released from prison and goes to work for Jackson, a man who he once saved in a street shoot out. Danny Trejo is on the screen for about 3 minutes, nothing to write home about.

The cops along with their rival, the ATF are after the gun dealers. Their role was done rather poorly while the thugs was done well, a reflection of what 50 cents really knows well. Hip-hop background music, no surprise. No nudity, quick sex scene, multiple MF and F bombs.",1298678400,3,939,4.491228070175438

8417338,4,B0046JLTLA,"This isn't an Academy Award winning level film or anything, and you can predict what is going on early in the film and it's a bit unrealistic that characters in the film who should don't.  Opening titles names such as Danny Trejo that appear, are only in the film for a few minutes, but the two actors on the cover Curtis Jackson (50 cent) and a let himself go since Top Guns day Val Kilmer are in the whole thing.  Those two do a pretty good job, Jackson wrote the film as well.  His character of course gets all the cool lines, demeanor and get to sleep with the film's hot chick (AnnaLynne McCord - actress best known for TV shows such as 90210, American Heiress, The Night Shift, Secrets and Lies).  It's fairly similar to most illegal gun running underworld type movies.  But there's plenty of people getting killed and stuff to pass the time.",1516665600,,848,4.410256410256411

8417340,5,B0046JLTLA,"Amazing film with dialogue that is almost Shakespearean if he were on benzodiazapam's . There are many munitions as well as shell casings which are necessary. I would guess that the grain on the 40 cal's are a complete 180 as opposed to 160 or 170. Of course this ammo must be full metal although there is something to be said of pure lead sluggs  since the idea is to hurt the antagonist and lead flowing through the blood stream is effective so why waste all that brass? OK, so this is a sarcastic review for a film that was fair but I enjoy seeing people getting shot and there is plenty of that.",1494633600,,599,4.254385964912281
