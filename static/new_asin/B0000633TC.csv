7958515,3,B0000633TC,"Anthony Gerace is good in this as ruthless Mob Boss Frankie T. Michael Gerace does really good playing Mob Caporegime Vinny Knuckles.
This is one of the most low-budget fils ever, but the acting is good. The un-realistic parts are the boss and the underboss don't usually interact that much and they don't combine crews. Other than that good movie. If you liked GoodFellas, Casino, or Ante' then buy it!",1399161600,,403,4.771428571428571
