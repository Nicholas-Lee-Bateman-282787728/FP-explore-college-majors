1828160,2,B000087F5T,"I'm a relatively big fan of the show, I always at least skip through when it's been recorded on the TiVo, even if I've seen the episode before.
So when I got the DVD, I was expecting not only less censoring, but also some extras, hopefully some not-aired footage, etc.
All they have on the DVD is a handful of episodes, which are less censored then the TV version.  You hear people swear, there's one or two women flashing, but that's all that's different.  No extra features or anything.
So my opinion is to just watch the show and let your mind fill in the censored parts.  If you really want to have the DVD, buy it used.  Hopefully the next DVD will have something more that's worth the money.",1056153600,6,697,4.338461538461538
1828161,4,B000087F5T,"If you're already a fan of Insomniac, you'll enjoy this DVD. It's nice to sit down and watch several episodes uninterrupted. Just because it's uncensored you shouldn't expect it to be too wild....just a few more expletives. It's pretty darn funny. Even if you've never watched the show before you may become a fan. Besides, it's at such a low price it's worth trying out.",1054425600,,371,4.723076923076923
1828162,4,B000087F5T,"I realize that there is nothing much more special about this DVD above and beyond what you have seen on Comedy Central.  So what, though!?  First, this DVD is relatively cheap, so don't expect many extras (though it would be nice to see at some point).  Second, while the choices for this DVD weren't the best, Dave Attel is still hilarious in every city he visits and makes up for the fact that the espisodes chosen weren't the absolute ""best of"" (a subjective point of course).  Quit griping, get this disc, and laugh your butt off.",1048464000,4,534,4.53125
1828163,2,B000087F5T,"Insomniac is one of my favorite TV shows. I love watching each week as Dave tours city after city in his own twisted alchoholic comedian type persona. If I visited these towns, these are the places I would go. It's a great idea and a great show.
But this DVD gives us nothing new. No new footage at all, just the original shows uncensored. We get to hear the bleeped cussing and we get to see a little nudity. But, like another reviewer said, the show really isn't about that, and honestly, the nudity we do get to see is not really worth seeing (Okay, the chick in Montreal is nice, but otherwise it's nothing exciting).
I was really hoping for some behind the scenes stuff. Maybe bloopers, out takes, and deleted scenes, or stuff so shocking or sexy it had to be cut out all together on the TV edition. I was hoping to see Brian the cameraman. All you get on this DVD is the exact same show you saw on TV without the Bleeps and the Blurs.
And who picked these cities as the best of season one anyway? The New York episode on this DVD is from season 2, and it is the worst of the three times Dave has done New York. The two New York episodes that really were in Season one were both great, and where is Memphis. That was the best epsiode from season one, hands down!
Anyway, love the show, love Dave Attell, totally dissapointed in the DVD.",1047427200,41,1341,4.221789883268483
1828164,5,B000087F5T,"Dave Attell is the best thing that's ever happened to Cable Television.  If you haven't been watching Insomniac with Dave Attell, now is your chance to catch up on what you've been missing.
The uncensored version does not diminish the original content of the Cable-TV edited program, since Insomniac is not really about gratuitous nudity and language.  Yet, there was so much more we would have liked to see on the DVD.  What about behind the scenes footage?  Clips which never made it into the show?  Even a ten minute mini-documentary would have been wonderful.  Maybe in the next one?",1045785600,3,587,4.82

This show is always entertaining and it is great to see Dave finally getting the attention that he deserves.  I am looking forward to additional volumes of Insomniac!!

1828177,5,B000087F5T,Dave Attell is one of the best comedians I love his stand up and I love this show.  You love Dave Attell you must own this DVD.,1330905600,,127,3.7037037037037037
1828178,5,B000087F5T,"I bought this DVD a few years back, before I got into online shopping and when mall stocks were limited and overpriced. So when I lucked into finding this at a small flea market at a fair, I jumped at it for $5. I'd loved the show and enjoyed watching it back. The lack of censorship was great and the episodes were as funny and interesting as I remembered them. Every year or two, I rewatch them (and Volume 2 as well). It's just a shame that Comedy Central and the producers haven't released actual season sets and the specials. I'd say it was a shame the series ended as early as it did, but it suffered from the same fate as Jackass did, with enough people catching on and mugging for the cameras in unrealistic ways that it ruined the nature.

As for the actual DVD, it's a little short with no real extras. It's your standard ""test market"" DVD that you'll find for a lot of niche shows like cooking or old cartoons or what have you. However, if you enjoyed the show during it's original run or just a night owl who enjoys barhopping/weird things, this is a great DVD to pick up. It's part documentary, a little COPS-esque, with real comedy that doesn't try too hard and is more or less just Dave cracking some off-the-cuff jokes (and he's one of the best at this) or else simply the people or places that speak for themselves.

I don't think $15 is a bad price, as I usually measure the cost by the quantity I'm getting and how often I view it. This DVD and the second (which has more episodes), are both higher on the list of multiple viewings than the majority of movies, and even TV shows I own. I really find myself getting caught up in every spot he visits, but with the rough nature, I tend to forget things quicker than a well plotted out movie, which makes rewatching more fun.",1267920000,,1791,4.295857988165681
1828179,5,B000087F5T,"I love the show and the DVD is cool because it's not censored.  There's no Hollywood BS, it's just a guy and a camera going around the city, looking for that towns interesting spots and people.  When ever Dave Attell does a city he really explores doing a variety of different things.  He won't just hit the bars, he'll do stuff nobody would think of like shooting rats with the police in New Orleans.

If you liked the show, you'll really like the DVD.",1122336000,,453,4.357142857142857
1828180,4,B000087F5T,"I was a little dissappointed by some of the episodes Comedy Central decided to put on this DVD (say Montreal, as an example).  Not that any of the episodes were bad, just there were better episodes a long time fan like myself thought were funnier.
As well it might have been better for Comedy Central to just do seasons on a release rather than a handful of episodes.  But Comedy Central seems to have no idea how to do releases of their shows on DVD (save The Man Show).
Either way this is a great show and a nice introduction to the drunken late night subject that is Insomniac.",1062979200,,580,4.3119266055045875
1828181,5,B000087F5T,"After hearing his comedy album only a few days ago, I knew that I would have to check out his show, ""Insomniac with Dave Attell.""  The guy's funny, sarcastic and very entertaining.  So I knew the show would be good.  After seeing an episode of the new season, I decided to get the DVD ""The Best of Insomniac with Dave Attell: Volume 1.""  The show goes to show you that the fun and hijinx of comedy doesn't end when the act or set is over.
Dave Attell is the host and takes you on a journey full of booze, women, interesting people and wild parties.  As soon as his comedy act is over, that's when he takes you for a ride you won't forget.  And what's great is that this is an uncensored look, meaning that the language and other shenanigans that could never air on Comedy Central without being bleeped or blurred is here.  Get ready to enjoy the nightlife as you cruise around with Dave in the cities of Chicago,  Houston, New Orleans, New York and Montreal.
The show is very original and unique.  It doesn't fail to entertain for a second.  It's 107 minutes long, giving you tons of material to watch.  Although it would've been nice to have the complete season of the show, this is still a nice thing to have.  And you know there will be a Volume 2 coming out in the near future.
""The Best of Insomniac with Dave Attell: Volume 1"" is more than enjoyable.  It's funny, edgy, entertaining and memorable.  If you've seen the show on Comedy Central or love Dave Attell, then check out this DVD as soon as you can.  I can hardly wait for a Volume 2 and I would love it if a complete season would be released on DVD.  Still, this DVD is not too shabby.",1059523200,14,1648,4.2508038585209
1828182,4,B000087F5T,"INSOMNIAC is probably one of the best travel shows produced! A blur of streets, bars, and clubs all across the country - it shows more of what you will see in a city if you head there.  No exotic places, just real people doing there own thing late at night.  All hosted by regular funny guy Dave Attell!  He's a likable comedian that seems more like the guy next door.  Here is REALITY TV finally!  Well ... there is one notable production illusion.  The show is shot over two nights and not one!  But why fault it for that white lie?  The DVD holds 5 episodes from the series.  No notable extras are here except that no body parts are blurred and no language bleeped.  It's not a whole season, and there is little insight into the show itself.  But what could you offer?  Maybe outtakes and bloopers!  Commentary seems a little useless for a documentary show that is 100% commentary in itself.  Behind the scenes could be nice.  But I'll settle for no commercials and 5 strong episodes of one of my favorite shows!",1058572800,6,1015,4.410810810810811
1828183,5,B000087F5T,"Finally it's here on DVD.  You don't have to be an Insomniac anymore to see some of these Insomniac with Dave Attell shows.  On this DVD, Dave starts in New Orleans.  A little stand-up routine in a club that will get you laughing.  Then he takes you on a late night, all-night tour of what's happening in New Orleans while most normal people sleep.  This is the standard for all Insomniac episodes.  Dave visits a bar and drinks. Maybe two bars or three.  Talks with people on the street.  Some get crazy (females and males) to expose themselves for the camera.  All nudity and language is shown on this DVD, that was originally edited and blurred on Comedy Central cable network.  What is edited on this DVD is beer cans and telephone numbers.  No advertising beer names.  But we all know what Dave is drinking don't we?  Dave is alot of fun and he is funny too.  He will take you to many other cool places from 10:00pm until 7:00am.  It's educational too.  Adults Only! This DVD includes only five episodes. Dave visits New Orleans, Louisiana. Houston, Texas. Chicago, Illinois. Montreal, Canada. New York City, New York (last episode of first season).  The New Orleans, Houston and New York episodes are from the first season in 2001.  The Chicago and Montreal episodes are from the second season in 2002.  For mature adults only.",1057708800,,1333,4.643776824034335
1828184,4,B000087F5T,"Insomniac has to be one of the best shows on Comedy Central after South Park. Who wouldn't like to seea comic go to bars, strip clubs, visit weird people and places all still open in the wee hours of the night. This compilation of Insomniac episodes is okay, but it isn't exactly the best. I could've picked better episodes than Montreal, New Orleans, Houston, Chicago, and the third New York episode. It contains no special features except the fact that it is uncensored. Most fans will enjoy seeing some of th eflashers on the street and the one chick at the porn convention in Montral. I did enjoy seeing Dave have a conversation with a man in Texas about a certain B word you can't say on TV, and hearing the profanity yelling at The Weiner's Circle restraunt in Chicago. The DVD includes no extra footage or bloopers which is a big downer. The only other real flaw is that on the back it shows four pictures from Dave's first trip to New York, an episode not on the DVD. Other than that, a DVD worth watching only if you never watch it on TV, other than that, you can probably watch these episodes on TV soon, censored.",1056499200,9,1124,4.408653846153846

This show was on at the end of good TV.. I remember watching it late at night when I was relaxing.

7979485,3,B000087F5T,"Love this show so much. I wish it was still on. Dave Attell going city to city, drinking and meeting random degenerates just seems to work and be a great watch. In a perfect world I would give this 5 stars, but of course this isn't  a perfect world, which means there are morons out there who decide to make this a 'the best of"" rather than a full season DVD. So many episodes are cut from the DVD. In fact I think well more than half were cut and we are stuck with only about 6 or 7 episodes. I don't know why they couldn't have just added all the episodes, but its really a shame because I don't know where to find this show elsewhere in its entirety.

This is really a great and hilarious show. We are just robbed of many episodes.",1435881600,,734,4.055172413793104
7979486,2,B000087F5T,"I must have started watching this show during season 3, which included London, Amsterdam and Dublin. Those episodes were terrific and I so I was really excited to share this with my friends. Unfortunately, the rest of the episodes from season 3, as well as every other episode from series, are in the U.S. (except for visits to Toronto and Tijuana), and frankly are just too similar to hold my interest. I mean, how different can the bars be in Phoenix vs Albuquerque? NONE of the European episodes are on the DVD.
I love Dave Attell's stand up comedy, and he is funny in this DVD, but you can get 90% of the content in one episode. Save your money.",1431820800,,649,4.416666666666667
