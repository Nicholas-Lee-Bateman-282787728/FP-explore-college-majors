6684385,5,B00NXR1EEI,"If you loved seeing Billy Elliot on stage somewhere, you will also love this video.  It's like sitting right up front in the theatre.  Nice close ups at times allow the viewers to see facial expressions that could be missed attending a stage production.  The optional subtitles also help in understanding some of the lines using colloquialisms not familiar to american ears.  Elliott Hanna does a great job of playing Billy and the finale bringing back twenty five previous Billys is amazing also.  Plays perfectly on my Blu-Ray player.",1423440000,7,536,4.977528089887641
6684386,5,B00NXR1EEI,"I've seen the musical live on stage two different times and in two different USA cities (touring company) and loved it. Couldn't wait until a filmed version of the stage play was done. This one is fantastic! Elliott Hanna is superb as Billy. All the cast members are great. It was a special treat to see them bring back Liam Mower for this live production - cast as the adult version of Billy. That dance sequence is always stunning. What amazed me most was how well this was filmed - multiple cameras, close-ups, following the action as needed, sound recorded directly from the source (and I never saw one microphone!) rather than sounding hollow and distant like most plays recorded in an auditorium. The audience is mostly inconspicuous and provides enough laughter and applause for this to be like you're really there without having the audience intruding on the performance itself. This was worth every penny, and worth every bit of the wait for it to come from Hong Kong. If you live in the USA and want this NOW! - get it NOW!  No need to wait for a USA distributor company to come on board.",1422144000,5,1098,4.573604060913706
6684387,5,B00NXR1EEI,"Forget every other theatrical experience...this is by far the best.  Gritty, well acted, sung and danced, at one high point, the perfect fantasy.",1420588800,3,145,5.304347826086956
6684388,5,B00NXR1EEI,"An exceptionally good musical given a perfect performance.  I have seen stage incarnations (West End, Broadway, touring) 8 times over 10 years.  This version is as good as it gets.  When I realized that no US release date was listed, I ordered the Hong Kong BluRay thanks to Amazon; it arrived a full week ahead of the projected date.  Perfect condition; great video and sound.  (Actually better than the cinema I saw it in a couple of months ago.)  This is one of those (very) few musicals based on a wonderful movie that is actually better than the original.  Elliott Hanna's performance is exceptional.  And in the comfort of my home, instead of the London theater which has possibly the least comfortable seats in world history.  If you enjoy this show, get this video.  (I would still appreciate a US release, however; there are a bunch of people I would buy it for.)",1419465600,14,872,4.640522875816994
6684389,5,B00NXR1EEI,"I have been a HUGE fan of this show since it opened here in the USA, and was beyond disappointed when it closed worried I's never get to see it again unless by some stroke of luck I landed myself in London. I was ecstatic when I heard it was being filmed (and saw every showing in theaters). When I found out the DVD release would be Region locked, I was determined to find a way around it. That's when I found this copy and ordered it. It is absolutely perfect!",1419033600,2,462,4.087912087912088

6684391,5,B00NXR1EEI,"Enjoyed the show in London. Thrilled to see it again (3 days only) on USA cinema in November. Sad to find the DVD or Blu-Ray is not yet available in Region 1 format.

GOOD NEWS! Amazon UK has the Blu-Ray version available for 12.99 GBP. (The format shown is PAL, which normally would not play on a USA player - BUT, this disk DOES play on my Sony Blu-Ray machine. I won't have to wait for Universal to wake up and realize there is a huge audience here in Region 1.

If you cannot wait, check out Amazon UK and order your own copy. With exchange rate and postage fees, the disk came to $21.
Try to keep it a secret though ...  the show is a sell out performance.

Bravo Billy and Amazon too! ENJOY!",1417564800,12,697,4.102941176470588

6684403,5,B00NXR1EEI,"This is an excellent recording of the stage production of Billy Elliot that captures the heart and energy of the live show as much as possible for a recording. This appears to be only a single filmed performance rather than several filmed shows melded together in editing (like with the Rent production that was filmed). I prefer that since it gives it a more ""live"" feeling. There are a few non-standard audience angles like looking down on Billy's bedroom from above and looking at actors from the side of the stage. They aren't used super often though. Most of it is filmed from the front and more standard audience views. There were a few moments when I would have liked the camera to pull out more for a wider angle in large group scenes instead of focusing closely on the main characters, but that only happened occasionally. The actor/dancer playing Billy is phenomenal, and the rest of this cast is very strong as well. The special dances after the curtain call with all the former Billys are a fun extra.",1481500800,3,1013,4.633333333333334

6684408,5,B00NXR1EEI,"I had always been a huge fan of Billy Elliot, the movie, so when I found out it had been turned into a musical in London, I clamored for the day it would come to New York.  After it did, I made the trek to see it on Broadway in 2010.  It then became my favorite musical.  I was a little nervous when I heard that the London production was being filmed. Sometimes stage shows just don't translate well on film.  Well, I had nothing to be nervous about. This production is amazing!  The one thing that makes it better than seeing it on stage, is the fact that the excellent camera work brings you up close and personal and you can feel and see the raw emotions the actors portray in their faces. I challenge anyone to keep a dry eye when Elliot Hanna sings ""The Letter"".  Speaking of Elliot Hanna, it is worth owning this production just to have the evidence of his remarkable performance. He is bound to have an amazing career ahead of him, as many of the other boys who portrayed Billy on stage have.
I strongly recommend this purchase. If you are a musical theatre lover, a fan of the original movie, or even a fan of Elton John's musical genius, this is the show for you!  Buy it!  You won't regret it!",1467504000,3,1204,4.22707423580786

6684419,2,B00NXR1EEI,"I have no idea why so many people out there rate this so highly. I saw it on the stage, and I thought that everything the film had - the show lacked. It's a very small story, about a close knit community, and that's where the show misses out. It's a great big cheese - fest, and there's not one good song in the entire score. When the biggest audience response comes from a little boy suspended from the top of the stage, you know the show's dead ordinary.",1457568000,,456,4.134831460674158

was like being there in person  ( Sony 1050w surround sound amp ).  My favorite song was GrandMa's
song which was sung by a lady who looked to be pushing 80 who could sing and dance with grace. She
was also very funny. That number was so touching to me I did not know if I should laugh or cry, so I did both.

6684452,5,B00NXR1EEI,"Words can almost not describe the intensity of Billy Elliot Live - The Musical! The entire ensemble is incredible - the storyline itself is simply spectacular. Billy Elliot weaves the stories of so many incredible people - and while the focus is about Billy, the stories surrounding his father, brother, teacher/mentor each have such impact. This is a must see for basically anyone - it is for those with dreams, those afraid to pursue their dreams, and for those living everyday life in support of their family and loved ones.

Based on the 2000 film version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Elliot/dp/B00003CXPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Elliot</a>, the musical version takes the incredible story previously told and adds music from a powerful Elton John soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Elliot-The-Musical-Original-Cast-Recording/dp/B000CS45RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Elliot: The Musical (Original Cast Recording)</a>&nbsp;that brings the story to life in an entirely different way. Every scene is spectacular, but with musical performances including the popular 'Electricity' and the powerful 'Once We Were Kings', the stage adaption takes the audience on a journey through music and spoken word. Scenes so powerful, the emotional viewer will often have eyes filled with tears. The 'Swan Lake' scene (one of many added for the musical) is breathtaking.

I am fortunate to have seen the musical live at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London during a visit in 2013. The show started on stage in 2005 and continues today. The DVD version is an actual recording of the live stage show, so while nothing can ever replace seeing this live, the DVD is the absolute next best thing as it is truly the stage performance and not a made-for-TV version.

For those who have never seen the original film, Billy Elliot is set in England during the mid 1980's coal miners strike (true basis of the story). A working class town, mining is the way of life and the path many a child will take. Instead of fancying boxing, Billy starts sneaking into the dance class. His teacher and eventual mentor encourages him to pursue his dream and eventually after much turmoil at home, Billy auditions for the Royal Ballet School in London (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-at-the-Royal-Ballet-School/dp/0416301916/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life at the Royal Ballet School</a>).

Though deep and emotional, Bill Elliot continually lifts your spirits and numbers like 'Expressing Yourself' and 'Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher' which will have you laughing along with the cast. One of the most human characteristics of this program is the presumed sexual orientations of the characters - a topic that is unraveled in both this musical version as well as the original film. The ensemble cast is simply brilliant - from the Billy featured in this performance (there have been dozens of Billy Elliot's on the stage) to the father, grandmother, teachers and supporting cast, each one brings to life this triumphant story of life. If you're not able to see the show live, buy this DVD - and even if you can or have seen the show, still, but it and watch it again. The DVD features the entire stage show, as well as a bonus number featuring multiple Billy's dancing in unison - something most theater goers never got to see.

Truly brilliant, see Billy Elliot! Stories like this are rare and will reach deep inside your heart.",1425686400,10,3562,5.588888888888889

8680993,5,B00NXR1EEI,"I came late to the game on this brilliant show!  I saw the original film a few years ago but missed the musical stage version completely. All I can say is wow!  This show has it all-great story, great music and lyrics, drama and humor but most of all a phenomenal cast singing and DANCING their (and) your hearts out. The spectacular finale will lead you to a standing ovation along with the live audience this show was filmed for...a special cheer for the young performer that played Billy Elliot and all the Billy Elliots showing us to be who we are!",1517702400,2,552,4.401960784313726
