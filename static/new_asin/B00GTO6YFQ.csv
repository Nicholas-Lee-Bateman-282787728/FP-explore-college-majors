6112456,1,B00GTO6YFQ,"Like the other reviewers, I was expecting Navy SEALs military action against some really bad guys, but, wait, no, the bad guy is a monster loose inside an underground energy research facility!  But our SEALs do not know that when they are PRIVATELY contracted by an American megalomaniac capitalist to go to his research facility deep in Russian territory to investigate why the communications network has failed. Stupid so far, but it gets worse. Tag along a ""communications specialist psychic"" who can ""feel"" vibrations in the air and can therefore know if there are other people present within a mile of her location! And she can tell you how many, too!!! Once inside the facility they encounter the voracious monster, and their main SEAL training comes into play: they unload what amounts to an orgy of more than 1000 rounds directly into the beast, but it ain't dyin', so these military macho guys spend the rest of the movie RUNNING for their lives!  I wasn't sure if I was rooting for the cowardly SEALS or for the monster!  What an awful, stupid, moronic movie!!!",1392595200,2,1071,4.809782608695652
6112457,1,B00GTO6YFQ,"I thought this would be a good action film, it was a good B rated action film that you could sleep through.  The first 20 min, there was more violence than I care to see....too much blood and gore.",1392422400,2,197,4.051282051282051
6112458,1,B00GTO6YFQ,"Cheap reuse of the same old stuff (props, storyline, sets, etc.).
1. First redux are stereotyped actors from bad boss to bad secretary to clueless mercenaries.
2. Add a stereotyped bad guy over acting from his glass enclosed central office command - been used too many times. With tech geek and a couple of computers.
3. A commando team with a female (attractive of course) psychic that can sense human vibrations (nice word but never explained, not that they could) within a mile (nice round number).
4. A helicopter carrying our commandos with large serial numbers on it's side that suddenly are not there in the next scene - nice CGI editing.  A bunch (around fifteen) of bad guys that get dispatched like shooting ducks in a pond. The usual concrete tunnel environment with lots of conduit and pipes for ambience. The usual cheap lab equipment used in past movies or reclaimed from a surplus store.
5. A storyline that must have come from a fifth graders mind. The usual out of  control radiation opening into a parallel universe that lets in the tiresome CGI creatures that look that fifth graders concept of blending armored beetle, spider and piranha and likes the taste of human.
6. The usual predictable who lives and who doesn't.",1392249600,2,1239,4.785046728971962
6112459,4,B00GTO6YFQ,"If you read the title of this film and assumed it was going to deal with Navy SEALs in combat or something similar, you are not alone; I, too, assumed the same.  And when I read the plot synopsis below, I was even more certain I was on the right path.  But wowwas I wrong!  The plot of this film somewhat resembles the description, but theres so much more to it as well.  The title SEAL PATROL may sound generic, but its an entertaining flick with some nice gore and even an intriguing science-fiction/horror storyline to go with it!

If you are not familiar with SEAL PATROL, here is the plot synopsis courtesy of Lionsgate:

In an effort to capitalize on tactics learned in the elite special unit known as the Navy SEALs, Navy veteran Lewis Locke forms a private team of ex-military contractors hired to extract high-value assets worldwide.  What follows is a mission these war veterans will never forget.

This is the plot description from the back of the DVD case.  Very vague, right?  I agreebut it piqued my interest nonetheless.  But check out how the Lionsgate website describes the storyline:

After losing contact with a clandestine energy-research facility, a powerful venture capitalist contracts an elite team of operatives to retrieve the physicist who holds the key to an unprecedented alternate energy source. Upon arrival, the operatives are ambushed by an extra-dimensional creature that has mutilated the onsite personnel. The team must develop a new brand of warfare if there is to be any hope of making it out alive.

Sounds a hell of a lot better, right?  Yeah, I thought so, too.  Interestingly enough, I didn't read this until after I had started watching the movie.  Needless to say, my mouth started watering, and I watched the film with renewed interest.

Im always intrigued when a production company gives their film a name that has nothing to do with the movie itself, though.  And yes, SEAL PATROL is one of those films.  Im not sure why they chose to name it so, because the group in this film are no longer in the military, nor is there any mention of them being SEALS prior to their current station (as private contractor operatives).  Granted, they are obviously Spec Ops of some sort, and one of them is a Brit.  But there are SO many other titles the film company could have used.

All of that aside, SEAL PATROL is a lot of fun.  It is shot fairly well, especially so for being a low budget film, and the acting is pretty solid as well.  I particularly enjoyed Rich McDonald, who is basically the main character in the film.  I am only familiar with one of his prior works, as a Mason on the Call of Duty: Black Ops II video game, but he gives a great performance and is very believable as a Spec Ops operator.

The special effects in the film are pretty good well.  Theres some very nice gore here and there, including an excellent shot of a bloody torso that has had its head torn in half; the only visible clear evidence of the head is a single tooth that is still stuck in the jaw.  Excellent visual.  My complaint about the effects, however, is that the creature is primarily CG.  The graphics are pretty good, but you can still definitely tell its animation.

But even that complaint is not enough to sink SEAL PATROL.  I give this movie a thumbs up and recommend giving it a look.  Dont expect a massive Michael Bay-type budget, but be prepared to be entertained nonetheless.  The film hits store shelves (with a limited theatrical release as well) tomorrow.",1391990400,8,3503,4.596774193548387

6112473,4,B00GTO6YFQ,"It is okay. Between a C and B+ movie. You had your heart rate up as the monsters from another world stalked the Seal Patrol. There seemed to be couple extra stories in the back ground that also were being told. There was times when you knew not who was the bad guys or good guys. Like someone was not who or what they said they were. Interesting special effects. Would I see the Seal Patrol again, maybe when nothing else is worth watching or a quiet afternoon and there was nothing happening",1439251200,,492,4.301075268817204

6112477,1,B00GTO6YFQ,"This is an extremely cheap, poorly-conceived and poorly-made action movie. First of all, this film has nothing to do with Navy Seals, ex-Seals of even Sea Lions. It's about a team of mercenaries who will do any job, for anyone, for enough money. In this case, they are double-crossed by their evil customer Eric Roberts, who has maybe 10 minutes of screen time in the entire film. I'm not sure what happened to Eric Robert's career, but all I seem to see him in these days are direct-to-video b-movies where he is in maybe 10 minutes of the film, but gets top billing.

In the end, the story turns into a cheap horror film, complete with fake-looking CGI monsters from another dimension. Other than Eric Robert's over-the-top acting, there are no performances in this movie worthy of note, unless you count the opening ""shower scene"", which really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The DVD features a behind-the-scenes look at how cheaply the film was made and the director complaining about the weather in Utah, where the film was apparently shot. Perhaps he should have taken it as a bad omen and shut down the production entirely, so that people like me wouldn't have been forced to waste 90 minutes of their lives watching this poor excuse for a film. Seriously, it makes Sharknado look like Citizen Kane by comparison.",1406851200,,1335,4.705128205128205

I found this movie listed in the top 7 best Navy SEAL movies of all time. That may be a little optimistic, but after watching the whole show while turning off my critical filter and just watching it without judging, I found it better than I expected. And that is always the best way to watch any movie.",1397779200,,471,4.3522727272727275

6112481,3,B00GTO6YFQ,"A rich guy (Eric Roberts) has an underground bunker/lab that he has lost contact with.  He contacts a military tactical extraction unit (The Black Jacks) to go and see what is going on at the bunker.

They go and encounter some kind of beast that they shoot a bunch of bullets at, ho hum.  Does begin with a gal in a shower which is about the only scene worthy of note.  Swearing throughout.  In the Extras there is some explanation of the shooting schedule that is interesting. Not missing anything if you skip on this.",1395532800,3,520,4.431578947368421

6112483,2,B00GTO6YFQ,"The working title for this film was ""Blackjacks"" the name of the private operating group that conducts itself as Navy Seals. I suppose ""Seal Patrol"" test marketed better in the US, even though there is no real patrol or SEALS. An incident happens, or is caused by Dr. Whitmore (Roark Critchlow) at a private secret underground reactor in Khazakstan, a nation Herman Cain can't find on a map. Once communications is lost Silicon Sara (Tina Casciani) who only gets important messages while in the shower, thank you, is the first to know. Her boss (Eric Roberts) hires the Blackjacks to find out what is going on at the facility. They take along with them Lisa (Kristina Anapau), a psychic human bloodhound with the expected minor telekinetic powers who doesn't shower.

Once they arrive, you can start scratching your head like you did watching that Indian Jones and Crystal Skull thing.

The movie was done in a faux-grindhouse style, not knowing what direction to take. The acting was horrible (hint: Eric Roberts is top billing). The plot was poorly developed. The character building was ineffective. You do get to see the creature who sees life through a green filter, about 15 minutes from the end of the film. Feel free to help yourself to a ""B"" and cheese rental.
