7843698,3,6303340857,"Quite a few years ago, after watching Field of Dreams for the bazillionth time, I decided to get every Kevin Costner film ever made. Amazon was the place to go.  I am not even sure I watched this one.  His career is one of ups and downs. Right now, he has been pretty busy with some good films:  Man of Steel,, Draft Day, 3 Days to Kill, and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit are his latest.  I wish he had done more baseball films!  Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and For Love of the Game.  Do I count Upside of Anger because his character was a retired baseball player?",1402704000,,562,4.157407407407407
7843699,3,6303340857,"Ted (Kevin Costner) comes home from China to 1920s Canada and he's trying to smuggle guns and trying to get people to give him either guns or money or both, and his younger brother is involved in smuggling liquor to the U.S., and then there's something about socialists. Go read the summary on the IMDB--I wish I'd read it before watching this, because I really didn't get all that from watching the movie 3 times. I certainly didn't catch that he was in love with the night club owner--I thought that was just sex and business.

The 20s atmosphere was excellent, and it's odd, but the whole confusion thing just fit with the film as a whole. There was very little dialogue, and what there was was terse. The scenes were mostly dimly lit, and if I'd paid very close attention, I could probably come up with what the roulette scenes symbolized besides the obvious all-or-nothing risks Ted was taking. (Or maybe it's not that deep, and I got it already.) All that fit together very well to make a whole. It's just that it's a period piece--a character study, where the character in question is 1920s Canada--and I prefer more story to my movies.

The Gunrunner strikes me as a movie to have playing in the background on a big screen TV while you're hosting a 20s party. If nothing else, a young Kevin Costner is definitely pretty.",1214524800,,1328,4.552301255230126
7843700,4,6303340857,"This film has the feel of the 1920s. I love the beautiful old cars and the clothes. There is a great Halloween Party with everyone dancing the Tango. Kevin Costner is so young and handsome! There is a lot of violence in the film but they were the brutal twenties. The plot is very straight forward. Kevin Costner is the man in the blues song, A man's got to do what his destiny leads him to. There are some good lines and thought provoking ideas such as: Are you a hunter or a predator? This to his love interest...",970704000,4,515,4.212121212121212
