7666231,5,B01BQ7HROW,"Incredible show! We all need to reflect on the world during WWII and the miraculous recovery and survival the civilians made during these most difficult days!  I find the stories of civilian life in WWII fascinating and read books on civilian life during WWII in all countries England, France, Germany, Russia, etc.... all suffered.  As always war brings the worst and best out in us and this show helps us learn what they went through. We should all appreciate that, as we live our daily lives, with not NEAR the hardships those living through this war had to endure.",1474416000,8,568,4.7272727272727275
7666232,5,B01BQ7HROW,It is so unfair of people to give a DVD a 1 star review because they didn't read the notice that Region 2 will not play on US players. That is their fault not the series.,1472169600,12,170,3.75
7666233,5,B01BQ7HROW,"The second half to a fun series, I hope they keep going",1471392000,3,55,3.6666666666666665
7666234,5,B01BQ7HROW,"Everything about this series is excellent, from the details in the storyline, to the richness of the characters and their relationships. If I loved Downton Abbey for it's clothes and historical drama, Home Fires is deeper and richer in character detail and drama.  I cannot believe they canceled the series after two successful seasons! Shame on ITV!",1471305600,21,350,5.140350877192983
7666235,5,B01BQ7HROW,"Wonderful writing, acting, costumes and scenery.  Anyone who says otherwise wouldn't recognize good TV if their lives depended on it, probably used to all the crap normally on TV.",1468713600,24,179,5.172413793103448

7666237,5,B01BQ7HROW,"I absolutely loved this series; real-life drama, real people; not just a screen full of beautiful hollywood types. It had so many  story lines yet to finish, so sad. ITV and BBC both tend to cancel a good series in the midst of a cliffhanger or two.",1482105600,2,249,4.297872340425532
7666238,5,B01BQ7HROW,"I'm sure I'll love it; however, I didn't pick up that it's Region 2, so won't be able to play it 'til I get a multi-region player!",1482105600,,130,3.8518518518518516
7666239,5,B01BQ7HROW,"To all reviewers who don't  know what a region 2 player is. England and other Europeien countries have different cycles then  USA  players.  you can get an all Region  player ,that's all countries encluding USA. From Amazon .com. All makes and prices from low too high. I'm a Brit been ordering DVD's from Amazon.co.uk for years, I get new series's three too four months ahead of U.S. That said ,season 2 of Home Fires is a must have, I would give it a 10 if I could. huge cliffhanger. Then ITV the British Network cancelled it. Simon Block the writer of the show is looking for new Networks . And already Season 3 is being written.  Remember the price of the DVD will be British currency, with a currency changer so that you can see the US price. if you want more info on Simon Block go too Twitter. Or go online. Remember you can get all your favorite British DVD's monthes earlier. There is  a Petition you can sign  to help save,Home Fires, there is one already started with thousands of signatures, in England.",1480809600,7,1015,4.448648648648649

How wrong!!!  The theme music was awesome, the actors were great, the storyline was amazing. It makes me so mad that the writers and whoever else decided to cancel it. They could have at least finished it up with a third season. Very sad!",1491177600,,432,4.6103896103896105
