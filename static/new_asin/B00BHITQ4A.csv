5621246,4,B00BHITQ4A,"This is going to sound like a negative review but it really isn't. I was buying some movies online and this was on the front page of the seller so I took a chance. It is what I call a 'simple' film in that there isn't much happening. There is no real dialog between the main characters except brief notes written on the beach and brief responses in bottles - too few really to feel a connection between these characters. His last frustrated outburst was moving however. This movie takes place over 6 months and there is so much we are not shown. (As with other movies that cover a long time span you wouldn't want to sit through every minute of every day.) What happened to the girl to cause her to seclude herself? Why were the people online angry at her? [A subtitle issue.] That being said, I wanted to follow these people and wished them well. I felt for the man when he was 'rescued' and was very pleased with the final scene. The call from the telecomm operator and the food delivery man were funny. I actually recommend this film.",1401321600,2,1037,4.350515463917525
5621247,5,B00BHITQ4A,"...If you can find it with English subtitles and in a region 1 version. Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print (I was too excited to have actually found the disk), the copy I ordered and received was in Korean with Italian subtitles and was in PAL format. The seller was very gracious about taking the item back for which I'm grateful especially as it was my mistake. I first saw this film on Netflix but it has since disappeared from their site. It is quirky, sweet and pure delight. I have found a region 1, English subtitled version online from a Japanese film company but it is unfortunately out of stock. I will keep looking though and maybe just maybe Amazon might find the right version in the future.",1394582400,27,713,4.492307692307692
8568508,5,B00BHITQ4A,A beautiful film. Quirky and fascinating. I wish I could see it again but all I can find are region 3 DVDs :( Wish it was back on Netflix!,1526947200,,138,3.793103448275862
8568509,5,B00BHITQ4A,"First - Be aware that this DVD is Not subtitled and will Not work on US players. However, the movie is exceptional, humorous, moving and always engaging. The story is of two broken people who, through long trials and ordeals, find each other and in doing so, become whole. It's a beautiful story of the cure of love for those missing it.",1521763200,,337,4.451612903225806
8568510,5,B00BHITQ4A,Dedicated to those who float around in lonely cities,1516838400,,52,4.888888888888889
8568511,1,B00BHITQ4A,"This movie fantastic. This listing is useless to those living outside Region 2, and who aren't fluent in Korean or Italian.

I bought it as a gift from a family member's wishlist, so it's my fault for not reading the fine print and am now having to deal with getting only a partial refund. But be aware that there are NO English subtitles and it will not play outside of Region 2.

Again, this movie is wonderful. I only gave it a 1-star rating to aid in others not assuming (by the near perfect rating score) that this DVD will work for them.",1510790400,2,543,4.262135922330097
8568512,5,B00BHITQ4A,It's rare a movie that good isn't a world famous blockbuster. Do yourself a favor and watch what is in my top 10 movies of all time. So creative!,1509148800,,145,4.0344827586206895
8568513,5,B00BHITQ4A,"This movie is outstanding. tragically, this is a Thai release with no English subtitles. That's not the seller's fault, so I kept it. I only hope this small act of good karma leads to an English release of the film.",1489968000,4,215,4.4
8568514,5,B00BHITQ4A,This is a really funny quirky little movie.,1485129600,,43,4.5
8568515,5,B00BHITQ4A,One of the absolute best movies I've ever seen. Wish I could find it on DVD or streaming.,1480982400,3,89,4.0
8568516,5,B00BHITQ4A,"This is the best movies I've ever saw on Netflix, and I'm so upset I can't find it there anymore! It has only a couple of characters and as a castaway type of movie it's much better than the one featuring Tom Hanks. It starts a little slow, and it took me a while to past the first 15 minutes, but once it starts you'll find yourself completely drawn into the story, laughing and crying and wishing it lasts longer.",1472947200,4,415,4.2
8568517,4,B00BHITQ4A,"I enjoy the movie, the only thing was less than great was there was no option for English sub titles.",1458259200,3,101,4.1
