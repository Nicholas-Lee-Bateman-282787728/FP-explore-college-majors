8585571,1,B00CS7GYWQ,Decent cast mired in sub-zero plot.  Only redeeming feature is the soundtrack which is a nice mix of country and pop songs.,1523145600,,123,4.590909090909091
8585572,5,B00CS7GYWQ,I fell in love with this movie when it first came out. So glad to have bought the 25 year edition. Everyone was great in the movie.,1430352000,,131,3.888888888888889
8585573,3,B00CS7GYWQ,"Dorothy Stratten stars in this ironic little film that depicts two detectives stalking a man's wife. She plays a character who is the object of desire and obsession, much like in real life. There are some similarities to the character and Dorothy's real life struggles with her estranged ex-husband, and watching the film leaves the viewer with an eerie and chilling feeling. I believe some scenes had to be re-written or re-filmed on account of Dorothy being murdered.",1430179200,,469,5.0256410256410255
8585574,5,B00CS7GYWQ,"Peter B. said this was his favorite film - mine too.  All these enchanting characters running around NYC.  Private detectives - Ben who knows all the ladies & could charm the clothes off any of 'em/Blaine (long hair/roller skates) NO slouch w/the ladies either & John Ritter - an incredibly clumsy P.I. & as cute as a button.  Entertaining & the cast is fantastic.  Audrey makes you forget to breathe.  I'd never seen the real Dorothy Stratten - astonishingly beautiful.  The film dedicated to her...RIP Dorothy.  Falling in love w/the wrong people - sometimes works & sometimes doesn't.  A freckled faced cabby & a country music singer complete w/irritating little dog round it out along w/the famous ""follow that taxi"" line.  Last, but in no way least - Sinatra singing ""They All Laughed"" in the background...",1402012800,3,811,4.904411764705882
