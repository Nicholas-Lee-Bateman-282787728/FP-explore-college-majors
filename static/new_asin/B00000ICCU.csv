7910085,5,B00000ICCU,"This is a must have video for beginning and beyond Lindy Hoppers.  If I didn't already have the whole set, I'd snap this up in a minute!  Yes, it's from about 1998, but Paul learned from Frankie Manning and the Stevens Sisters in Pasedena, California.  He series shows all of the basic Savoy Style Lindy Hop moves in a fun and easy to learn way.",1330732800,,345,4.276923076923077
7910086,5,B00000ICCU,"This is an another great video in Paul Maranto's series of lindy hop instructional videos.  He makes the moves he teaches fun and easy to do.  If you can get the whole series, you have a great foundation for dancing lindy hop.",1330732800,,226,4.357142857142857
7910087,4,B00000ICCU,"Paul Marento has an uncanny resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld. Making this an highly entertaining view. Lots of good stuff to learn, but sometimes a little to intricate.",1265155200,,165,5.148148148148148
7910088,4,B00000ICCU,The only draw back with this video is that it did not delve into some of the moves unique to 8-count swing and the Charleston foot work.  But Chris and Julie do an excellent job of teaching the swing out in a way that anyone can learn from it.  They also do a good job of adding in 6-count swing to help students adjust to mixing 6 and 8 counts.  I would make sure that you have either a sound back ground in 6-count swing or view the previous two videos in the series (Beginning/Intermediate 6-count Swing).,1004400000,3,508,4.216494845360825
7910089,5,B00000ICCU,"I purchased this tape because of the reviews and they were all correct. I was amazed when I discovered just how long and thorough this tape really  was! Just when I thought the tape was over, there was more, and more, and  more! Well worth the money. Dance steps are broken down for both the guy  and girl. They are repeated about three times each, at different angles and  speeds. I especially liked the white background and the camera angle, which  made the steps easy to see. If you are just starting to learn Lindy style,  this tape should be in your collection. Just make sure you get the beginner  Lindy Hop first, so you can follow the footwork. Eight count with triple  steps can be confusing to learn on the fly.",966816000,10,721,4.409090909090909
7910090,5,B00000ICCU,"We were hesitant to learn swing moves from a videotape but were pleasantly suprised. A healthy understanding of the basic Swing/Lindy moves is essential, but if you're ready to break out from the basics, this tape is  for you. There are a ton of moves offered in this 90-minute tape, and no  time is wasted. Paul and Irene perform in front of a white background and  use wireless mics - a great way to teach via video. The dialogue is fresh  and spontaneous - this tape never feels scripted and is fun to work with.  We plan to work through this tape a few more times and then try their  aerial video.",931219200,23,601,4.321428571428571
