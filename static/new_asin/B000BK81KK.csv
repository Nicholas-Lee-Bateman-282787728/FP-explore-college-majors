I particularly like the fact that they use the correct name for the side being used---that is , their left , but saying"" right "" I need to admit that I'm a Sr. Citizen - but I'm still pretty active--do lots of walking, water aerobics  and tap dancing.",1303516800,,406,4.0

8087849,4,B000BK81KK,"The program starts with about eight minutes of yoga and warmup moves from Kundalini yoga. This is followed by 16 minutes of very light ""cardio,"" and then to the floor for some core work followed by a closing yoga pose.

I think this is my favorite of the YBB Lives because the dance choreography is the easiest to learn, and it's not hard on my joints.  It's low impact, which is why it's called Light & Easy.

The set is bright and colorful, with gold, turquoise, and white fabric panels.  It has a hardwood flood with frosted woods and bright lights.

There are six or so class members, who are led by Teigh and Gillian.  They are of varying sizes, showing that this YBB is for everyone, not matter their size.

The instructors, Teigh and Gillian, are cheerful, fun and positive, as in all the YBBs.

Ravi, the drummer, is back, as he is on most Live YBBs, adding a fun element.

The YBB DVDs are fun, and a great way to get a some movement into your life if you are new to exercise, returning to exercise or low on energy.",1390608000,3,1025,4.296875
8087850,5,B000BK81KK,"I have to say that I was an intermediate exerciser before my second pregnancy. Once I had my son I felt I was more a beginners level. I started working out again when he was 7 months old. I wanted something not too hard and fun. This fit the bill. I love yoga in general, and this gives me some yoga, meditation, cardio, and toning, all delivered in a very fun way!!!!!! Teigh and Gill are great instructors and easy to follow. I am so glad I found Yoga Booty Ballet! Even though the workouts are a bit old they are excellent. Very different from what I am used to do (Cathe, Slim series, 10 minute trainer, 10 days to a better body, Tracy Anderson, etc.)
I recommend all of the YBB dvds!!!!!!",1369008000,3,693,4.2180451127819545
8087851,5,B000BK81KK,"I'm starting out with this CD from my YBB collection as a way to get started on my dance exercise routine.  It may not be that 'easy' to begin with, but it'll get me going in a fun way.  Thanks to the other reviewer for the suggestion to start with this one.",1345939200,,258,3.9423076923076925
8087852,5,B000BK81KK,I have all the live workouts and really enjoy each one. This one is good when you want to do something but not at full speed.,1329350400,,125,3.8461538461538463
8087853,1,B000BK81KK,"I should start by saying that this is the 1st YBB dvd I have purchased.  Unfortunately, this is not my ideal type of workout.  I normally do dance-martial arts mixture cardio workouts.  I know this says ""light and easy"" but for me it was too hard to figure out some of the steps.  Glad I tried it, now I won't waste my money on the other YBB dvds.  Wont do it again either.",1309910400,,373,4.054794520547945
