2605154,1,B000GDI23I,"The film will never be the definitive Burning Man documentary.  Too bad its one-dimensional focus on five or six individuals who plan and organize each year's event.  With little storytelling and lots of unedited ramblings by the founder and some project managers, the best that can be hoped for is that portions of this movie might get excerpted into maybe twenty minutes of needed mundane details about the behind-the-scenes goings-on at the festival.  But as a two-hour-plus movie, there is precious little to evoke in viewers the kind of emotional intensity that brings so many tens of thousands of people to Black Rock Desert to experience the magic of Burning Man.

The film fails in two specific ways.  First, the interviews focus almost exclusively on five or six of the main organizers and a couple of the artist-contributors. None of these people actually have that much to say that could not have been finished in two or three minutes.  These probably-wonderful people are transformed by this movie into mere talking heads who spend an awful awful AWFUL lot of time laughing at their own jokes as they rave about their ""passion"" for Burning Man.

Virtually every scene in the first half hour fails to hint at any story, fails to incite the viewer to wonder, ""and then what happened?""  And where are the paying attendees, who need to be asked Why did you come, What are you doing at this moment, and How has Burning Man has affected your life?  Precious little film is focused at any length on their actual faces and bodies, or their individual artistic creations.  So it's hard to identify with those who attend.  Imagine watching a royal coronation without plenty of footage about the spectators, or a sporting event without the crazy antics of the fans -- yes, that can be interesting, when the event is for spectators.  But with Burning Man, when the whole purpose of the event is its effect on those whose participation actually creates the event, the film falls flat on its face.  One artist builds a big flammable temple-like structure and talks about his passion for having it burn down in an instant.  Yeah, that's interesting, but it's not enough to carry the whole film.  Maybe the producers needed a bigger budget, big enough to make a film worthy of Burning Man.  Maybe the organizers thought a film about THEM would be interesting, but it's NOT.

Rent the movie if you must.  At the living-room sized gathering of people with whom I watched this film, the only ones laughing at the lame jokes were two women who laughed at everything the talking heads said.  The rest of us were all yawning and squirming in our chairs and nobody stayed to talk about the film or plan their visit next year to Burning Man.  Go, if you must, and don't let this film pour water on that intention.",1346544000,2,2801,4.712525667351129
2605155,3,B000GDI23I,"This was just okay. You can stream it for free in a lot of places. If you have no idea what BM is this will help. However if you just want to actually see the festival, the art, the people, there are probably better movies.",1315267200,,223,3.977777777777778

2605157,4,B000GDI23I,I have friends and family who attend so I decided to learn about it.  My wife and I watched it and we both enjoyed it and found ourselves interested in attending in the future.,1265155200,,176,4.176470588235294
2605158,4,B000GDI23I,This is a very well done vidoe. It covers the events that happen at Burning Man in the desert. I bought it to see what it is all about. Now that I have seen this DVD I am planning on attending Burning Man in 2007,1167782400,4,212,3.7333333333333334
2605159,3,B000GDI23I,"The common perception of Burning Man is that a bunch of drunken revelers descend on the Nevada desert, walk on stilts, ride freaky bicycles, put up incomprehensible art and act like they can alter civilization into some sort of anarchist's Utopia.

""Beyond Black Rock"" goes a long way toward dispelling that notion. Several of the artists profiled here are thoughtful in their creativity, and you can feel the passion they invest with their annual trek to the playa. The organizational skills shown make you realize that the chaos is highly structured. And the Burning Man philosophy of ""Leave No Trace"" proves that the organizers are as responsible to the environment as they claim. (The same can not necessarily be said of the attendees, who leave so much behind that it takes a crew several days to strip the area of debris.)

The main drawback of ""Beyond Black Rock"" is its length. The running time clocks in well over two hours, and I got up a couple of times for breaks. had the editors of the documentary displayed the same kind of organizational skills the Burning Man coordinators did, this DVD might have risen to a fourth star. As is, ""Burning Man: Beyond Black Rock"" just goes to show you what a little creativity and a good plan can eventually lead you to.",1166572800,7,1269,4.711711711711712
2605160,5,B000GDI23I,"Just like there is a ""For Dummies/for Idiots"" book on just about every topic under the sun, the DVD could be subtitled this for those interested in learning more about the Burning Man experience. As a two-time burner who's happily going back to the Playa every chance he gets, this movie is special in that it's great on many levels.

First off, it's an incredible introduction for those who have never heard of or gone to Burning Man. As with all attendees, you realize there are so many people in your life who would enjoy and benefit from at least one trip our to the Playa that you can't help but want to share. Yet all your words, pictures and the website really don't even seem to capture what it is you feel and want to express. The DVD shows that in so many ways. From the personal stories it follow throughout the film to  the nuts and bolts of how Black Rock City come into being each year. My best friend and I are using the DVD as a promotional tool for some of our friends who have been on the fence about going for a while.

Which brings me to the second major point of greatness for the film, it's ability to educate and inspire even those who consider themselves veterans of the Playa. Seeing what other people go through to make the event happen can inspire more volunteerism. Hearing the stories of joy, pain and creation is inspiring to making you want to add your own art/theme camp to the city. And then just plain watching the party energizes you to get off your butt and start planning RIGHT NOW (whenever now is) for the next burn. You feel the Playa. You taste the dust.

All in all, Burning Man is a life changing experience that if you're interested enough to check out this DVD, you should attend at least once. I think viewing the DVD will give you that swift kick in the butt to actually do it and arm you with just a bit of knowledge about where it all comes from and what you might expect from your visit to the Playa.

Welcome Home!",1165968000,5,1965,4.3
2605161,5,B000GDI23I,"I rented this film on Saturday, September 2, 2006.  At the time, I knew little about the event, except that at the very same moment I was sitting on my living room sofa with a bag of microwave popcorn, 35,000 slightly-nutty people were somewhere out in the desert setting fire to all sorts of strange objects, the biggest of which was shaped like you and me.  I just thought to myself, ""What better a day could there be to get more acquainted with the subject?""

From the moment the credits rolled on this the documentary, there was really no turning back.  That very night, I promised myself that I would join in this unique experience the very next chance I got.  I've since showed it to a few other friends, and they too have fallen under the spell.

As for the documentary itself, it does an excellent job at showing just what goes into making the event happen.  I got a real appreciation for the staggering amount of work involved, and the zealot-like devotion it inspires in both its staff and its participants - the line between which is thin and blurred by definition, as everyone who goes is expected to do something to help create the experience.  I found their passion infectious.  As they described the impact it had on their lives, how it changed them as people, I was left pondering what kind of fascinating ways might Burning Man one day change me?

Of course, it did not make me feel ""just like I was there.""  On the contrary, it fully convinced me that even the best film on this subject could never replace the experience itself, and that if I wanted to truly know Burning Man, I had to go.  Some might count that as a weakness of the film, but not I.  The fact that the film starts with the assumption that you could never translate the true experience of Burning Man onto celluloid is the very thing that makes it brilliant, and accurate.

From the mind-boggling diversity of its participants, to the ephemeral beauty and strangeness of its art, Burning Man is not just an effigy, it's a conflagration of IDEAS blazing in the Nevada desert.  And after seeing this film, I swear it's one fire into which I fully intend to throw myself!

UPDATE: Aug 2008: At the moment, gearing up for my second year on the playa. Burning Man 2007 was a life-changing experience, and this year looks like it'll be even better. Two years hence, I still give this film credit for introducing me to a whole new world, and teaching me so very much. If you really wanna be a burner, this film is a great place to start your journey.

UPDATE: July 2010: Even after three pilgrimages to Black Rock City (soon to be four), and nine trips to smaller regional burns, the wonder has not ceased, and the magic will not fade.  Indeed, the burner community has become a second family to me, and these festivals my second home.  I look forward to each and every one with the kind of childish glee that's barely possible to contain.  Over the years, I've loaned or screened this film to anyone who's expressed a sincere interest in the subject, and gifted it to several who were serious about going.  By now, I've seen about ten other documentaries on Burning Man (all of which I own) - but of them all, this is the only one that I loan, screen, or gift - which is what keeps bringing me back to this page.",1165449600,18,3292,4.444259567387687

Watching David Best build that temple was a visual treat to behold. Would have liked to have seen more stunning works of art on display -- the ones that I have intimate memory of from 2003 - on. The Belgian Waffle, etc., but the movie was made prior to my visits.

A space where self-indulgent exhibitionists flaunt their godlessness and defiance. A space for the lost who have rejected God and any traditional path (besides new age combined with primitive and paganism), but feel desperately that vacant hole inside them that only God can fill. As our culture continues to reject authority and objective truth and to feed on technology as it is fed to them, seeking bigger and better thrills, expect it to thrive, along with other pagan celebrations of similar ilk.",1479427200,,809,5.136363636363637
