8588599,3,B00D2L8PWY,"Three people leave their unhappy homes to set out on their own. Coincidentally, they all come together working for a traveling musical troupe. The troupe has its troubles, but a star emerges. This film is a British production featuring heavy English accents with rapid-fire delivery. One has to concentrate to understand the dialogue. Theres lots of arguing and people yelling at each other. Nevertheless, this musical has its momentsnot too many, but a few. Its a long slog through this one to enjoy a few tender moments and some musical highlights. Jessie Matthews is the primary highlightshe truly shines. Entertainment value of this film is only moderate.",1528070400,,659,5.168224299065421

8588602,5,B00D2L8PWY,"Fun and well-made British film is a delight. Jessie Matthews is a musical film powerhouse, and the other cast members are good, too. A look at the long gone vaudeville/ traveling entertainer troupe/1930's era that will uplift everyone's spirits.",1444089600,,245,5.3076923076923075
8588603,5,B00D2L8PWY,"J.B. Priestly was the initial attraction. Had that been all it would have been enough, but Jessie Matthews and John Gielgud make the film more than literary. They make it life. .
The DVD is  adequate for a film produced in  1933. Remade in  1956 but to less sensual effect and musicalized by Johnny Mercer and Andre Previn the 1970's, this is the version to get.",1389139200,3,362,4.454545454545454
8588604,5,B00D2L8PWY,"The main reason I'm writing this review is to clear up two points.  The running time listed for this movie is 93 minutes.  Thankfully this is an error.  The actual running time is 108 minutes.  This is a complete print.  When I received the DVD even VCI listed the time as 93 minutes.  The second point is that VCI has released nine Jessie Matthews movies on DVD this year.  As I'm a big fan of hers, this was a very nice surprise.

The movie itself is very enjoyable and very British (which I think is a plus).  The one negative thing about this film is that Jessie Matthews is hardly in the movie for the first 40 minutes but she is worth waiting for.",1381881600,7,653,4.201612903225806
8588605,4,B00D2L8PWY,"I first discovered British comedienne/singer/dancer Jessie Matthews when I watched - and favorably reviewed - the 1930s film ""First a Girl!"" (the film that inspired Blake Edward's film - and later Broadway hit ""Victor/Victoria""). Matthews was a delight and I wanted to see more of her films. But a search showed that only one other film was available in the US and she made a bunch of them. What great news when I learned the independent DVD reissue label, VCI, was going to release FOUR of her films this year!  This is the first one I have watched - others are coming - so I'm only basing my review on this film.

Before I start I should point out that - as I write this review (September 2013) there is already one review. But the review is dated October 2010 and is of a DVD-R version that must have been available then. Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a film, so I always encourage readers to look at the date of a review and compare it with the release date of the DVD. That said, I'll move on.

Though Matthews is prominently listed on the cover of the DVD - in many photos - she is just one member a a fairly large cast of players she doesn't even appear on screen until about 15 minutes in. She does get to song and dance two numbers though. The plot has a group of unconnected people, each escaping something in their life, who join together to help a struggling music hall troupe succeed in show business. The oddest casting is that of Shakespearean actor (Sir) John Gielgud as a piano player (and Matthews love interest!). but is good.
The film was made in 1933 is the early days of sound films. VCI says upfront that the film was ""restored"". For the the opening titles of this 93 minute film the image is jumpy but then it settles down. This may not have been correctable; I don't know. The sound however is a bit rough and it is made worse by the sometimes thick British accents (these films were not made for export and some of the regional slang is difficult to understand.). But VCI at least comes to the rescue by providing English subtitles - in VERY easy to read yellow typeface which is of a readable size. (I wish more companies would use yellow instead of white for subtitles). Actually some of the subtitles are funny because they sometimes show phonetically when slang is used and whoever was charged with creating the subtitles couldn't decipher the slang. So I found them helpful. (Note that the package says the film came from ITV Studios - one of the British commercial TV networks - so maybe they created the subtitles. Anyway, I'm glad they are there.
VCI has also added one more ""bonus"" and that is a series of press photos and lobby cards which are shown to the soundtrack of the one ""hit"" song in the film as sung by Matthews.

No, this is not as much fun as ""First A Girl"" and Matthews is just a member of the cast (rather than the STAR) but it's entertaining DVD and VCI deserves credit for taking a chance on getting the rights to make it available in the US.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8588606,5,B00D2L8PWY,"J.B.Priestley was a best selling author of his day. Few of his books are still in print, but a read-through of what is available confirms that he was a fine author who has been unfairly neglected.

He wrote of a time which was similar to ours today, with the media full of bad news, economic troubles, chronic unemployment and a general sense of frustration for ordinary people. Priestley's basic idea was that we just had to ""turn a corner"" to get into a zone of excitement and fulfillment. This idea comes through very clearly in ""The Good Companions"" which quickly became a monumental best-seller. This movie was made nearly 80 years ago and the acting comes across as rather ""theatrical"" for a present-day audience.  Nevertheless it is excellent entertainment, not least for the presence of a very young John Geilguid taking a break from his early career performing Shakespeare.  Also, Edmund Gwenn doing his best to simulate a Yorkshire accent.  This was many years before he became a star in the USA in his great role in Miracle on 34th Street.",1287619200,6,1050,4.7845303867403315
