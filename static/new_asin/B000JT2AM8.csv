Yes, I realize this is the 1940s, when both video and audio technology was nothing like what it is today. Still, to put an item such as this on the market, with quality this poor, is beyond the pale to me. Not to mention the exceedingly poor job the company (QPI) did in just putting the DVD together, replete with mistakes and/or lack of information. I cannot recommend more strongly to anyone to not purchase this item. At this very moment, I am wrestling very hard with myself about possibly returning the item to Amazon. If I do, it will be my first time out of a great many purchases of ever having returned any item to them.",1384214400,,723,4.323529411764706
