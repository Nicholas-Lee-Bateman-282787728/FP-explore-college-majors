7076741,4,B00V5JEIVM,"First off, these DVDs are a great deal! You get 2 whole seasons for around $7.50--there are no DVD bonuses or extras (other than some best-of shows), and the packaging is very pedestrian (4 DVDs stacked on top of each other, no inner sleeve, etc.). BUT if you are a fan of the show and are just looking for all the episodes, then, like I said, this is a great deal! On a side note, the show itself starts becoming too over-the-top and not as funny as the seasons go on (in my opinion)...",1439510400,,487,4.191489361702128

8709304,5,B00V5JEIVM,"this set is got the same issues and pluses that the last 4 sets have had pluses are the original title song is in but then the neg is the door clank in the title is now further in, neg is all 4 discs are on one spindle instead of being in a 4 disc holder box, plus is its a small set and looks nicer then 2 big sets, like I said before buy a 4 disc blank box to save yourself so you can save the disc for a long time, neg is this is a bare bones set no bonus content of any kind unlike the prior releases and it is in the original picture quality so no HD remaster it retains the original air quality but that is a plus for an older classic as this",1500508800,,648,3.6357142857142857

8709310,4,B00V5JEIVM,"Seasons 9 , 10 and 11 aren't my favorite seasons of Married, but they are great nonetheless.  I loved the edition of Griff, he was almost Al.  His only one up on Al is the fact he's divorced, so he occasionally gets those hot women.  And, he's the funniest no-maamer.  Love these season sets from Millcreek, and i'm happy to get to finish off my collection.  Highly recommend these sets and this show to old fans, and newcomers alike.  Seasons 2,3,4,5 and 8 are my favorites, the ones that would get my five stars on basis of the show, the others are great as well.",1450742400,,565,4.333333333333333

8709312,5,B00V5JEIVM,"This is the Bundy family in full form. What's not to like? In any case I always enjoy seeing Buckingham Fountain in Chicago featured in the opening credits. In my view Al Bundy in series is at least equal to Archie Bunker, maybe better actually.",1446854400,,245,4.466666666666667
