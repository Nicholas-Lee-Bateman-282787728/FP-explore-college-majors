3423767,5,B00197THQG,"If, You are a true fan of death metal know one should go without buying dvd it's a great look at the history of what would become one of best gore bands in the world selling one million cd's and are still playing brutal metal
a must buy!!!",1216425600,2,239,4.0
3423768,5,B00197THQG,"Bassist Alex Webster is right: this 3-disk set will keep the CC fan occupied until the next comes out next year.  I've been a huge CC fan for years, but this DVD will give any CC expert a run for their money.

The first disk covers the band's history in exhaustive detail.  It'll eliminate any confusion about who was in which band before they formed Cannibal.  It gives a pretty balanced look behind the reasons for Chris getting kicked out of the band (both the band and Chris himself wanted Chris out).  The history is organized by album; musicianship gets lots of coverage here.

The 2nd disk has various CC performances, couple of which are almost entire shows.  The rest of the shows are little snippets, some being just one song.  It does have all of the music videos, thus negating the need for pixel-y youtube versions.  Plus it has Travis from Black Dahlia Murder singing ""Stripped, Raped, and Strangled"" with George (definitely the highlight).

The 3rd disk has lots of killer bonuses.  It contains in-depth discussions of the artwork and the lyrics.  The Metalocalypse bit should have been longer; there wasn't any footage of George recording his lines in the booth.  The disk does have lots of entertaining tour stories (Rob almost blowing up with the RV, playing in Jonny Depp's Viper for Cher's son's birthday...), and also shows band members living out their personal lives.  You may see George is many things, but I think you may see him as more of a peter-pan than a death metal vocalist after viewing this disk.  Oh, and there's an amusing claymation short that incorporates a lot of the covers--butchered at birth being the ""star"" of the short.

In short, every hardcore CC fan (am I covering the entire fanbase here?) should have this!  Great performances, and you'll get a deeper insight into the twisted minds of the band.",1215907200,10,1845,4.751572327044025
3423769,5,B00197THQG,This DVD set has everthing a fan of this band would want. First Disc 1 has one of the best history segment I have seen since Iron Maiden's Early Years. It talks in great detail the beginnings of the band and each describing each album almost fully.(KIss should do a histry like this) Disc 2 has great live and videos through the years. Disc 3 is also entertaining and quite amusing at times. Don't pass this one by!!!!,1215820800,8,418,4.371794871794871
3423770,5,B00197THQG,"Like the title of the review says, Centuries Of Torment isn't meant to be Live Cannibalism 2. So if that's what you're expecting, you're likely to be disappointed. It's more like what 15 Year Killing Spree was, but more of a visual history of the band. Disc 1 is a 3 hour documentary on 20 years of the band, from the early days to today. All of the members, old and current are featured (with the exception of guitarist Bob Rusay), including original vocalist Chris Barnes. 20 years seems like a lot to cram in, and 3 hours is a long time, but if you're patient, it's worth viewing. Disc 2 has live performances from 1989 to 2007. I've loved both eras of the band, but the more recent footage shown is better not because of the performance, but the audio quality. You're kinda reminded of Monolith Of Death when you're watching the older footage on here. While that dvd wasn't a total disaster, it wasn't worth buying. The more recent footage from 2005-2007 is where the quality improves. The Toronto 2006 show is probably my favorite one eventhough the sound is tinny at first, but it improves by the middle of the second song. Second favorite performance is Party. San 2005. If you didn't get enough from the first disc, Disc 3 shows extra footage where they talk about artist Vince Locke, the ban on their first three albums, fan tattoos, Metalocalypse, merch, lyrics, and more. I'm sure that there may be some stuff missing from the documentary, but then it'd probably end up being 4 hours long. Either way, if you're a fan, buy this now.",1215561600,21,1543,4.553956834532374
3423771,5,B00197THQG,"The live shows on this set are really good, but the most entertaining portion of this release is the 3hr documentary on the life stages of Cannibal Corpse from its inception to the modern era.  All members past and present are on hand, excluding Bob Rusay (guitars), one of the original members fired after ""Tomb of the Mutilated"" was released.  Alex Webster comes off as a very sincere person about his chosen work, and his portions of the interviews are just about the best.  As a fan of the 'Corpse, I would recommend this to just about anybody into death metal--it's a good documentary that shows where a lot of the roots of the USDM around New York and Tampa started at.",1311811200,,675,4.516393442622951
3423772,5,B00197THQG,"IT'S WELL SPENT MONEY. I'M GETTING TO OLD TO HANDLE THE MOSH PITS, SO THESE 3 DVD'S GIVES ME A CHANCE TO SEE CANNIBAL IN CONCERT WITHOUT GETTING ALL BRUISED TO HELL. I DID GET TO SEE GEORGE WHEN HE WAS LEAD VOCALS FOR MONSTROSITY IN MIAMI FLORIDA. HE'S A REAL COOL DUDE. NOT AS INTIMADATING AS HE LOOKS AND SOUNDS ON STAGE. HAVE FUN WATCHING THESE 3 DVD'S THERE EXCELLENT. GET CANNIBALIZED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1299628800,,404,4.5479452054794525
3423773,5,B00197THQG,"This box set IS the essential purchase for all cannibal corpse fanatics.
every important live performance short and long is here (regardless of quality).
every uncensored music video in the bands catalog (not including evisceration plague) including two banned from mtv2's hbb for being too gory is here.
for the history documentary everything minus the bands censorship issues in
germany and abroad(which should be able to be seen on youtube)are here.this doc
is aproximately 3 minutes shy of 3 full hours.

i would love to see cc issue a dvd covering all the censorship problems they have had to deal with from the beginning to current, WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

if you don't have evisceration plague yet? be true to the gore and get your
copy in two disc digi-pak format NOW!

I have been a worshipper of this band since 1990 and thanks to this band i'm a proud
gorehound dvd videophile. blood, guts and gory to all whom bow to the corpsegrinder!! for you are all worthy:) and remember, otto backwards is still otto.",1274313600,,1018,4.740112994350283
3423774,5,B00197THQG,"Wow. The first disc alone, covering the history of the band is almost worth the price of admission. Interviews with all band members, past and present (except Bob Rusay), friends, crew, and members from other metal bands give us a very clear picture of the development of the band from day 1.
  The live performances sometimes suffer from bad sound, but overall, it's still amazing to watch, especially the older footage.
 Disc 3 contains many sections that cover everything from album art, life on the road, the bandmembers' side projects, etc.
  All in all, this is absolutely essential viewing for any hardcore fan of the mighty Cannibal Corpse. I laughed out loud quite a few times during the course of the history and the ""extras"" discs.
 If you're a true fan, you MUST get this.",1261785600,,784,4.770370370370371
3423775,5,B00197THQG,"My boyfriend is a huge Cannibal Corpse fan and I heard that this DVD was very highly rated and just an overall good buy with tons of concert footage, etc. So I bought it for him for Christmas and he loves it. It was a good buy, a quick and smooth purchase. Recommend it for fellow metalheads. \m/",1231286400,,296,4.120689655172414
3423776,5,B00197THQG,"when i first herd about Cannibal Corpse coming out with a dvd, i was quite hesitant about picking it up. A couple of my friends told me it was very good and to get it. After i got it, i watched it for a week straight. if you are a Cannibal Corpse i highly suggest buying it. it tells you about how the band started, who does their art work, how they right their music and much much more.",1225065600,,387,3.911392405063291
3423777,5,B00197THQG,"This DVD set is worth every penny. Footage from the early days, more recent footage as well. You get up close and personal with the band members. What's even better is that Chris Barnes, who I respect but do not fancy, is here to bring his testimonial.

To be mentioned : great editing work. The story flows very professionally. It's something I can't say about Lamb of God's ""Walk with me in Hell"" DVD.

Go buy it, you won't regret it.",1219968000,,436,4.37037037037037
3423778,4,B00197THQG,"As soon as I saw the contents of the DVD a few months before the release, it was clear that this could be one of the best band-related DVDs there is. For me, the best is definitely Evergrey's A Night to Remember, with the hours upon hours of studio work, backstage footage and interviews, all wrapped up with a very good live show.

Centuries of Torment comes very close to that level, but unfortunately it is the live show part that falls ever so slightly short. Personally I've never been a fan of compilation live footage, with material from several different shows with constantly changing audio/video quality. If you prefer it like that, this is a nice DVD. It has clips from many different years and places with few tracks appearing twice. I was horrified when the main girth of the live shows, the Toronto 2006 show, started off in extremely poor sound quality. Luckily the sound picked up after a few songs. Maybe they had technical problems at the mixing/recording desk?

But the interviews and history told by the band themselves, and pretty much anyone who ever had something to do with the band, really makes up for the slight live show troubles. This is definitely one of the most thorough band DVDs I've seen, including the Evergrey one. Nothing is left untouched, and the Bonus Chunks part really goes out there with the bizarre tidbits - delicious!

Overall for the price (especially ordering from Finland, with the Euro being very strong vs. the US Dollar), this is simply an awesome package. The packaging artwork and holographic coating is also very cool, wrapping up this piece into one great release!",1217289600,2,1621,4.761565836298932
3423779,3,B00197THQG,"The documentary on the life of the band was totally awesome. That was worth the purchase of the dvd alone. However, the live videos were crap. When I bought this I was, I was primarily buying this for the live stuff. I didn't expect all the live vids to be top quality (like the one's from the 90's), but I expected the one's from '00 an on to at least be digital, which they were not. The sound quality of all the live songs and video quality of most live songs looked and sounded like they were taken from a video camera. Needless to say I was let down on that part.",1217116800,,568,4.080357142857143
3423780,3,B00197THQG,"This historical Cannibal Corpse-document comes in a beautiful digipak case with Vincent Locke's illustration in emboss and a ""rainbow effect"" (don't ask me what the exact word is, but lenticular doesn't quite seem right). The only downside is that the rainbow effect is used all over, so it's harder to make out the actual image.

The first disc covers the entire history of the band, starting from before they ever played music up until the release of Kill and ends pretty much on the fans and their own words. It goes from having a sort of reminiscant tone ""way back when we did crazy stuff"", to words from more current bands involved and such. It has a lot of insight and some funny moments as well, but since there's twenty years in three hours, it often feels pretty cramped and ""rushed"", so don't expect a runthrough of individual songs or studio footage (except as background-clips). You do get a strong sense of who they are and where they came from though, and the hardships and good times of staying true to their music for all this time.

On the second disc, there is a collection of live performances from different eras. Unfortunately the quality (the picture, sound and camera angles, not the musical performance) only ranges from bad to worse, even in the concert from 2007. It's lackluster bootleg stuff. At times I found the first performance video (from the late 80's) almost had better sound quality than the latest performance, and it shouldn't have to be that way. If you want to really see or hear a good Cannibal Corpse show, get Live Cannibalism on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B0000507QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CD/dp/B00004Y6RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CD</a>. It captures the raw intensity with perfectly good enough sound and picture, and that's why it works as a live album as well.

The music videos (all they've done) are included and look fine (quality-wise). If they look a little ""cheesy"" (and are pretty much all in black and white), that's more likely because it was intentional. There's also ""Stripped, Raped and Strangled"" with Trevor from The Black Dahlia Murder. It sounds like a big deal, but it's really not. Trevor jumps around a bit, and sings along, but is barely heard at all because Corpsegrinder does the song normal, drowning him out completely. Bummer, could've been more interesting.

The third disc was really a great addition, worthy in itself. It's shorter little features (varying in length from very brief to in-depth) about Vincent Locke's art (great artist, but he needs to speak up!), the bans and controversy, the fan tattoos (all brief, some fantastic), the merch and shirts, touring (or rather crazy stuff on tours - very funny segment), lyrics and songwriting (informative - funny rejected titles), George being in Metalocalypse (wish we'd seen him in the studio), sideprojects, who the people in the band really are (one of the longest and best additions of them all - very surprising and entertaining!) and finally a little claymation segment inspired by Vince's art (pointless but pretty cool).

I can recommend this DVD if you're interested in the history of Cannibal Corpse or early death metal in general, it spans their entire career so far with interesting tidbits and a lot of nice info about the band members themselves. But I can not recommend it if you want their live performances, for that I'd still have to say, go with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Cannibalism/dp/B0000507QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Cannibalism</a>.",1216684800,,3701,5.429565217391304

8272302,4,B00197THQG,"Its about time CC release some sort of bio or documentary about their history. Ever since 1995, most of the younger generation haven't even known who the REAl CC is. They have no idea how integral chris barnes was to Cannibal Corpse's original sound. After wathcing this entire DVD set, I cant see how anybody could not agree that CC '88-'95 was and will always be superior to the current CC band. george Corpsegrinder is a good singer but he cannot sing the early material worth a hoot. Any songs he sings from the 1st 4 albums his growls are totally watered down and sound nothing like barnes. Why do you think the band never plays songs like beyond the cemetary or split wide open with george? Because his growls are simply not low and brutal enough. Under the rotted flesh, entrails ripped, buried in the backyard, you won't ever hear these songs sung by the current CC cause corpsegrinder cannot sing those at all, which is a shame cause that was the best music CC ever wrote.  Edible Autopsy..the list goes on and on. Corpsegrinder cannot sing these songs right. To corpsegrinder's credit the new material sounds great and this band has never released a bad album, but for the live shows, the old classics from the 1st 4 records sound weak without Barnes. Hearing Six feet under play hammer smashed face makes CC sound like a cover band when they play it.",1354147200,,1361,4.577868852459017
