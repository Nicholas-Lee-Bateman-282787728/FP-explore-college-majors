They arrived on time, and have proven a good quality purchase which was reasonably priced and in good working order. I look forward to ordering the season 8 set as soon as it becomes available on dvd.",1245974400,,279,4.384615384615385
8200511,4,B000RGN2JS,"I was about ready to set this series down when I first picked up seasons 1 and 2.  It has this problem with being repedative.  The Meteor rocks did this, the meteor rocks did that.  Was starting to get pretty boring.  Then around season three the over arching plot started and the actual story from the books that we all remember began to take hold.  Then it got good.  Suffer through the first couple of seasons for this great show.",1214179200,,433,4.35
