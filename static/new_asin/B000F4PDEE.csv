8117306,5,B000F4PDEE,"I gave this as a birthday gift. She was very pleased, and we watched it that same evening! Unfortunately, the very early Pokemon episodes have not aged well, and it was kind of embarrassing to remember how obsessed we were about it way back when. My friend's favorite Pokemon is still Jigglypuff (though she's starting to get rather attached to Espurr as well). :-)",1416355200,,365,4.71875
