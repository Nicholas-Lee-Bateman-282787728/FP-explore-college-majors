3819659,5,B001V7YZH0,"I remember watching this show on a barely viewable UHF station as a kid.  I loved the show.  I believe that this show more accurately portrayed the spy games during the cold war era as apposed to the James Bond movies.  Aside from the cardboard sets and the now laughable gadgetry, the acting and the stories were gold.  As I view them today (more clearly), they still hold up and I am so happy to now own Sets 1 (season 3)and 2(season 4) plus what is left of seasons 1 and 2.  This was my first introduction to the great Edward Woodward (RIP) and I've been a fan ever since. His portrayal of Callan as an spy/assassin with a conscious is amazing to watch. Callan was a bit of a tortured soul but he understood-didn't always agree--the necessity of his assignments. I would recommend this series to anyone--not just to those who lived through this time period but also to anyone who would like to have some notion as what it was like during that time period.",1315872000,2,958,4.389830508474576
3819660,5,B001V7YZH0,"I had heard about this series from youtube and was very excited to order.  Exactly what I expected.  Great acting by all cast members but especially by Edward Woodward, he can carry a scene with no background music and no one else and you can feel the emotion!  If you liked him in the Equalizer then you'll like him in this earlier spy thriller set in England.  Hard, gritty, bucks the system spy but with a tempered compassion that gets him into trouble.",1275955200,,456,4.457831325301205
3819661,4,B001V7YZH0,"Edward Woodard was by anyones standard a great actor, in fact he was often called englands finest actor even , he one awards to prove it and his presence always added to a production. Sadly he passed away in nov 2009. But this landmark series lives on dvd to show one of his finest characterizations ever.  This isn't the first series those are only available in region 2 and you'd need a all region player to watch them.  (those players are around one hundred bucks). If you go to go to amazon.uk you can get the dvd sets of the first two series. This was in fact series 3 and the show starts at that point. Hopefully acorn will put out the first two series but they say they probably won't do it in this region.  Callan is extremely realistic in some regards and some of it's episodes should be shown in spy training. as in "" Are you willing to do this?""  The lead character is  a realist who does have a concious even though he must kill people and when things go wrong innocent people may die.  The show was shot on video tape and the outdoor scenes were shot on film. So it doesn't have the feel of american shows of the period but it doesn't matter because the show is just excellent on many levels.
Callan is a spy who doesn't always agree with his assignments but he doesn't
want to lose his job  or be replaced by younger agents either.
So if you want well acted truer to life spy stories that are realistic and not over the top then you will enjoy this one.  And if you want to complete the collection then get a all region player and get the first two seasons on amazon.uk. (don't buy the two earlier seasons from their without FIRST BUYING a ALL REGION DVD PLAYER)
But this one is good to go because it is region one (our region) and first class entertainment all the way.",1272153600,,1784,4.241887905604719
3819662,5,B001V7YZH0,"For years I remembered the lightbulb and signature tune for Callan, the series is even better than I remembered.  Dynamic tension cleverly portrayed.",1271116800,2,149,5.478260869565218
3819663,5,B001V7YZH0,"Having personally lived aspects of  the Cold War and read the contemporaneous literature of the time and the revisionist literature  coming out now, it is heartening to see  personal ethical  conflict in these then contemporary now retro-episodes

The low key trudging flavor of real intelligence work is evident with the occassional terror of needed action.

The inability to trust even the agency for which one works creates a burden that ultimately withers most individuals.  Career agents  experience  a life of conflict and tumoil or a life of oblivious obedience.",1261180800,4,569,5.303370786516854
3819664,1,B001V7YZH0,"Callan was a great series, but the packaging of this product is misleading.  ""Set 1"" is too easily confused with ""Series 1"".  If like me you have already purchased ""Series 3"" then you will be very upset that you now own two copies of ""Series 3"". I know the editorial review makes it clear, but when you are a fan you do not think you need to read such reviews...  Ok, so next time I will whenever I consider purchasing a product packaged by Acorn Media.  Mind you, I will probably not buy on principle.",1258848000,33,502,4.252631578947368
3819665,4,B001V7YZH0,"Callan is a British SIS assassin during the Cold War. He was forced to retire when he lost his nerve. Now an alcoholic has been, he's re-activated for a mission, where he's expected to fail.",1252627200,,190,4.457142857142857
3819666,5,B001V7YZH0,"David CALLAN (Edward Woodward, The Equalizer) was blackmailed by a secret part of the British Security Services known as ""The Section"". They wanted his skills. He didn't like or want the job, but he had no choice, but he was good at it. This former soldier turned thief, was 'drafted' by ""The Section"".

The Section head, codename Hunter (William Squire), AKA Charlie, is cold, ruthless, needs Callan, and cares little about who gets killed. Concern is only the how, why, and if anyone finds out.

There's a nucleus of regular cast, but each episode (9 in this Set 1) is primarily a new suspense story involving espionage, murder, blackmail, and all those good black things. Callan is THE top agent (realism, no James Bond or Get Smart stuff here)--kills when ordered--is a deadly shot--with a tinge of conscious, fair play, and justice.  It's a bit on the dark side, every man for himself. A collection of individuals in a dark world, void of trust.  A climate where right and wrong have no definition. Sometimes Callan has to much personal emotion for his job of deceit and dirty-tricks.  That makes for a fascinating character. Great character relationships throughout the series. Well, some relationships turn downright nasty. Callan even has feelings, though never shown, toward a dirty, criminal type, Lonely (Russell Hunter), who is occasional helpful, in all the bad ways of getting the job done.

The ""Section's"" colour code for files: RED= dangerous, priority, target death; YELLOW= occasional surveillance; BLUE= wrong party; WHITE= put out of action via prison, bankruptcy, mental home, etc. What colour is your file?

Downside: no subtitles. But they'd help little with the British slang used occasionally like: bird=girl, nik=arrest, belt up=shut up, ta=thanks, quid and bob=$$$ but how much?

A fun series for those who remember the late 60's/early 70's.  Filmed at that time period, the British scenes, decor, and clothing styles resemble everyday life in the USA about then. This DVD series is NOT a 1970 period drama, just a very good intelligence/spy series created and aired during the 60's to 70's decade change.

This CALLAN SET 1, originally aired April to June, 1970, is the 3rd season. Many of the B/W episodes telecast earlier had been ""lost."" Acorn Media has saved this season for all of us.  TA.  Fortunately in 1970 the show went to color.

3819683,5,B001V7YZH0,I simply cannot get enough of this series. In fact I have watched SEVERAL times and Edward Woodward's performance is just mindblowing. I wish there were more sets available vs sets one & two!! KUDOS for another fabulous british spy import!,1423008000,,239,4.853658536585366
3819684,3,B001V7YZH0,Callan is one of the best TV series ever. The problem with Set 1 is it is actually Series 3.  I was disappointed to find that it does not contain Series1.  The title is somewhat misleading I feel.,1414886400,,196,4.131578947368421

3819686,1,B001V7YZH0,"10 years ago I purchased SET 3 of Callan and loved it ( 5 stars).The moment I saw set 1 and 2 on Amazon I purchased both. I was sent 2 copies of Callan set 1 and returned one for credit. Mistakes happen

However on playing Set 1 I discovered that this is in fact SET 3 and this starts in the middle of the series
I imagine if ever Amazon gets the first two original sets ( pre SET 3 ) then they will have great trouble giving then a set number.

The series is great - and if you don't mind buying the series half way through then this is a good buy

But I will think twice before buying DVD sets from Amazon
In fairness this is a British series and Amazon may not have been aware of the position",1406505600,2,695,3.8461538461538463
3819687,5,B001V7YZH0,"This truly is Edward Woodward's show and his talent, abilities and inspiration carry through the series. Intelligently written, the viewer must pay attention to catch the nuances between characters in this program about an intelligence agent, an assassin, who is full of personal doubts. Woodward plays Callan as cold, efficient yet with a personal charm and honesty that comes through in his relationship with Lonely, an odiferous sneak thief and sometime alcoholic he rescued from the docket and now employs as his helper. Callan's relationships with his colleagues are often cold and efficient, and cutting, as he is with James, a new and cocky member of the agency. His boss is officious and intelligent, yet keenly aware of Callan's great abilities and his frailties. This is an excellent and engaging series. Woodward's personal talents extend to his inclusion of his toy soldier hobby which has its part to play in the show, and Woodward was the marksman who shot out the lightbulb in the opening credits, as he reveals in the dvd commentary.
Not James Bond, but a fascinating and serious study of a spy and assassin who is all too human.",1400371200,2,1145,4.96875
3819688,5,B001V7YZH0,"Watch and enjoy as you get to understand why Woodward is always an angry man.

3819689,4,B001V7YZH0,"More action that the ""Palfry of Westminister"" series.  Productions standards are on a par with British TV of the time (i.e. not high) but enjoyable none-the-less",1365638400,,161,5.1923076923076925
3819690,5,B001V7YZH0,"Glad I found out about the CALLAN series---fun TV espionage from the Len Deighton/John LeCarre school of dead drops and one time pads.

Callan (masterfully portrayed by Edward Woodward) and The Prisoner (masterfully portrayed by Patrick McGoohan) debuted on ITV within 90 days of each other in 1967.  I used to believe Pris was Brit TV's best cult spy drama, but being an American I'd never gotten to see an awful lot of British TV spy drama either.  Usually those shows don't translate well when they're broadcast to American audiences.

Compared to Callan, The Prisoner is juvenile, it just hasn't aged well, only a handful of decent episodes anyway.  Shot on film, Portmeirion yielded greater production value than Callan's videotaped kitchens and basements on a zero budget.  Callan and Number 6 are basically the same bloke, downtrodden anti-heroes, Everyman underdogs, blahblahblah, but Callan outdid Pris with a legacy of better acting and a long succession of better scripts.

Callan is the best spy show Americans didn't get to see.",1355184000,4,1041,5.124260355029586
3819691,5,B001V7YZH0,"Exceptional drama from Thames Television from the late 60's-early 70's starring the late Edward Woodward, more familiar to us here in the States as the principal character in ""The Equalizer"" series that ran during the mid-80's.  Woodward plays Callan, a spy for a secret arm of the British Secret Service, so secret in fact that the his boss, William Squire, is identified not by name but by his code, ""Hunter.""  Callan, middle-aged and more comfortable discussing the rudiments of Napoleonic warfare and collecting toy soldiers and wargaming,  is reluctantly the ""top man"" takes ""all the dirty jobs"" with an eye on his target and other on his ruthless colleagues--expertly played by the duplicitous Anthony Valentine as Toby Meres and the impulsive Patrick Mower as Cross--who are more likely to twist a knife in Callan's back than provide the necessary back up on a mission.

With that said, the episodes are tremendously entertaining if short on action by American standards. The scripts are superb, as the writers have clearly disposed of the ""champagne and caviar"" adventures of James Bond, but instead present a terribly complex but realistic portrait of cold war espionage in all of its ugliness--the deception, torture, duplicity, and divided loyalties that characterize spying at it's most ruthless. Supporting cast is also excellent with the late Russell Hunter as the not-so-bright Lonely, Callan's only friend, informant, and freelance accomplice in his nefarious deeds. The episodes are presented chronologically, so it's important to watch them in consecutive order--references are made to former characters and events in a consecutive timeline as Callan's cynicism towards the Section, his superiors, and his colleagues virtually reaches a boiling point at the close of Set 1.  All in all, a most enjoyable set as is Set 2 (although the second set is noteably darker in tone) but just as engaging to the viewer. If you're looking for a James Bond adventure replete with bullet-proof cars and femme fatales who look like they just stepped off the pages of a Victoria's Secret catalog, look elsewhere.  Callan is the real spy deal in all its gritty ugliness.",1341532800,12,2171,5.188571428571429
3819692,5,B001V7YZH0,"I highly recommend this show!  Very dark and moody, but sometimes funny show with excellent acting, writing, fair picture, great theme music.  Callan's boss, Hunter, played by William Squire,is great, very humorous without trying, although the character, Lonely, probably gets the most notice for humor.  Although these episodes are somewhat stand-alone stories, there is some continuity lost from prior series, as I never saw the prior two series.  I would sure like to get the first and second (B & W) series to get the whole story of Callan (with Set 1 being the Third Series) As with most British TV sets, it is rather expensive, but not disappointing in the least, even for the price.  Edward Woodward is fine here, as always; very convincing as an extremely dangerous but sometimes nice killer/fixer.  When Callan makes a threat it is not idle, even to fellow agents!  I have yet to watch Set 2, but I am looking forward to it.",1323561600,5,933,4.79375

8345645,5,B001V7YZH0,"Great show. Gritty. Not something you would likely find on American TV because the episodes are believable & don't always end well. Has the feeling of a dark, 1960s European spy thriller. Great actors and stories. And I think the cinematography was excellent.  There wasn't a lot of room on small square TV screens when this show was made, but the camera work filmed what was needed. There's one episode, I think it was ""Suddenly - At Home,"" where the camera filmed from inside a bathtub as a KGB agent posing as a hotel maid jerks the shower curtain closed while cleaning, leading into the next scene.  That was a lot of activity to get inside a small TV screen and I thought very clever.  I also like the music.",1500249600,,713,4.469230769230769
