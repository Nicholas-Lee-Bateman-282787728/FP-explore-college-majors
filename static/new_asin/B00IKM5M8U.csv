6268403,5,B00IKM5M8U,"I loved this movie! It's kind of a combination between Batman Begins and The Karate Kid. It's great to see a film that focuses on classic martial arts and not just mixed martial arts style fighting. This film has a lot of heart, good fight scenes, likeable heroes, loathsome villains, and some great training montages. What more can you ask for?",1402012800,,345,4.672131147540983
6268404,5,B00IKM5M8U,"If you love fighting, this movie has plenty of it and authentic as well with world champions acting in the film. It also has a great story and inspiration behind the fighting. Don't let the cover fool you, it's not all about the fighting and classic character actor Michael Biehn has a starring role even though the region one DVD seen here doesn't include his name or picture on the cover.",1401148800,4,390,4.507042253521127

8643022,4,B00IKM5M8U,"Direct-to-video MMA films have always been an easy target. While MMA has long since captured the mainstream, more traditional karate and kickboxing flicks have metaphorically beaten the small screen cage fighter to the ground and kicked him as he lay. ""Tapped Out"" shows that the subgenre is finally getting to its feet, ready to be taken seriously. Despite the film's occasionally ridiculous narrative decisions and other shortcomings, I am genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. This is a serious coming-of-age story with a martial arts theme, and I definitely recommend it.

The story: A maladjusted teenager (Cody Hackman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hidden-in-the-Woods/dp/B00DI67YCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hidden in the Woods</a>) working off his community service at a local karate dojo embarks on a quest to confront the murderer of his parents (Krzysztof Soszynski,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Here-Comes-the-Boom/dp/B005LAII1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Here Comes the Boom</a>).

There are many reasons that this movie might have failed, not limited to its curious casting and status as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karate Kid</a>&nbsp;knockoff, but it perseveres. At first glance, Cody Hackman appears to be your average prettyboy but turns out to be a real-life competitor who delivers an strong performance as a steadily-improving martial artist. His sensei is played, of all people, by old Michael Biehn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00MBNZ3W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>), and Biehn somehow manages to be 100% convincing as an instructor. The screenplay the two of them act out is also to its film's credit: the journey of the main character is refreshingly nuanced, with significant victories and setbacks throughout that are not directly tied to the buildup of the ending. Different forces pull him in different directions in a lifelike manner, and even when the movie resorts to moments of clich&eacute;d stupidity, these are at least grounded in logic. Stupid decisions are addressed in an almost self-aware manner by the script, and traditional martial arts are not downplayed.

Like most movies marketed as MMA flicks, there is some disappointment in the false advertising of ""Tapped Out"": UFC megastars Anderson Silva and Lyoto Machida are prominently featured on the DVD cover, but are in the film for only ten minutes. Additionally, the ground & pound fight scenes are not about to outdo the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-II/dp/B00FRILRSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja II</a>'s. With that said, the brawls are still a solid highlight of the film. Admirably foregoing slow motion and featuring decent editing, the dozen fights are at worst bearable and at best downright exciting. The choreography is far from ground-breaking - there's some intricate grappling, but that's it - yet the pace and dramatic components of the fights are admirable. I found myself actually holding my breath during some of the later matches simply because the filmmakers did such a good job of making them such close contests between characters I had invested in.

There is no guarantee that traditional fight fans will enjoy this as much as me, and even I teetered on whether to give this a lower rating simply because it wouldn't matter to me if I never saw Cody Hackman in a martial arts movie again. While it may not have rewatch value, this action-drama is worth at least a single viewing and will probably do the trick for general martial arts devotees and MMA nuts alike. Rent it!",1436832000,2,3827,6.107806691449814
8643023,5,B00IKM5M8U,"This was a great movie. It was about a teenage boy who wanted revenge against a famous fighter who responsibly killed his parents years earlier.

You would see the change/maturity of the boy throughout the entire movie.

It is worth watching. At first, no one really took him seriously. But, he persisted and became an extraordinary human being who inspires and blesses others.",1423353600,,377,4.968253968253968

8643026,3,B00IKM5M8U,"As a child, karate kid Michael Shaw (Cody Hackman) witnesses the brutal murder of his parents, barely escaping with his life. Seven years later, Michael is a troubled teen who starts up karate again and develops a love interest in Jen (Jess Brown) the niece of the karate instructor (Michael Biehn).

Jen takes Michael to a fight club where he sees the enormous man, Dominic Gray (Krzysztof Soszynski) who killed his parents. From here you can pen the rest yourself. Clubber Lang vs. the chicken armed Karate Kid with dead parents.

This is an adult film using a child's movie plot. It was on the order of a made for TV type film. It was watchable,predictable, just not exciting unless you really really love fight movies.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. Brief Poster nudity. Jess Brown bra/panties.",1404691200,2,803,4.846715328467154
