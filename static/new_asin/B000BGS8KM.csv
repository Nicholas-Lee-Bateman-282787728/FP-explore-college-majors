2416941,5,B000BGS8KM,"LOL..Well I enjoyed Boystown, being from Chicago and we are truly know for what is Boystown. After watching it a couple of times I looked at it as almost like a gay soap opera. The music was great and I purchased the soundtrack which is amazing. Apparantly the asian guy in other review doesnt understand the concept. As with every show you either love it or hate it. I do want to see them step it up for the next episode but Im there.",1143763200,4,435,4.190476190476191
2416942,4,B000BGS8KM,"A new Gay show.  After QAF, I needed something to fill the void...

This episode caught my attention.  But the episode is a little raw and needs to be ""spiked"" up a little.  I was slightly disappointed.  The characters were briefly introduced and the story line was limited.  I gave it 4 stars because even though this episode is raw, I feel it has potential.  In my opinion, they have my attention with the plot.  But the story line is a little weak.  I think they need to introduce the characters more.

Will I get more episodes, most likely.  Even though this first episode was weak, I would like to find out what happens....

Its not for the QAF fans though.  This show is different.  Definitely a work in progress.",1141689600,5,719,4.430769230769231
2416943,5,B000BGS8KM,"I saw this last year at the N.C gay and lesbian film festival and loved it. I also was able to meet some of the cast members and spent a couple hours hanging out with Rick,Albertossy and L.K., they were all so gracious and made my experience a very memorable one. I also purchased the soundtrack for the show which is awesome. Hope to see you again this year!",1138492800,,359,4.217391304347826
2416944,4,B000BGS8KM,"I thought Boystown was entertaining, got several laughs. Alot of memerable lines especially in the party scene. Made me think of Sordid lives, low budget but entertaining. The landscaper can do my yard anytime he wants!",1128643200,8,219,5.111111111111111
2416945,5,B000BGS8KM,After watching this dvd I want to see more. The story line and the quality of this independant series is excellent. Enjoyed the characters very much. Can acutally relate to one of them. I strongly suggest this dvd to anyone looking for something different. I hope the second episode comes out soon.,1128470400,17,298,4.75
2416956,5,B000BGS8KM,"I always thought of this series to be more of a exploitive bed-hopping narrative!  This was what I saw from a distance(trailers), but never really watched the series.  It is more of a window into the lives and loves of some very intense and emotional young men.  This series really carries the audience into a very emotional level of these men's lives.  This is very difficult to explain verbally and can only be felt on a pure emotional scale!  The acting is far beyond what any superlatives could adequately describe.  NJMJr!",1435363200,,527,4.736263736263736
2416957,5,B000BGS8KM,Interesting would love to see the series.  The story lines were pleasant and nice to see gay guys with regular issues,1403740800,,117,4.571428571428571
2416958,1,B000BGS8KM,"From the opening line of mere exposition. Oh you are a success you gave up dancing to become an architect, to the unsexy sex scenes, this series promised to display the fine art of just touching the surface and going no deeper.  I gave up after ten minutes",1394928000,,256,4.333333333333333
2416959,1,B000BGS8KM,"I realized this is an old movie which was not very well acted.  For it's history I appreciate it, but it really is
slow and forced.",1394064000,,131,4.038461538461538
2416960,2,B000BGS8KM,"Boring, clich&eacute;, implausible in some parts, and overall low quality production and script.  Maybe it was just a bit campy and outdated for today's audience...?",1393372800,,165,5.6
2416961,2,B000BGS8KM,"The acting, camera work and sound work on this screams independent low budget, which I am okay with as long as the overall story is really good.  The acting was not horrible but bad enough that I kept losing interest in the movie.  Two of the actors were in the movie Heels and they did a better job acting there.  The actors were really cute but I just didn't care about the story as it moved on because of the acting.  I felt like I wasted my money on this one.",1392768000,,463,4.054945054945055
2416962,3,B000BGS8KM,"tired plot.  Leaves viewer not  knoing if this a pilot episode, or
a teaser.  Acting weak by all males.  Just not believablle.  It apperas
this film was a cinema 101 submission.",1388102400,,177,4.580645161290323
2416963,1,B000BGS8KM,"Don't waste your time or money on this thing. There's nothing good about this. It's the same old hackneyed gay drivel of similar efforts. People do change, evolve and lead interesting lives in the gay community--if I can use that term in its most inclusive sense--but you'd never get that from this awful thing. Sometimes, cute boys can make-up for shortcomings, like no story, but not this. Stay away. Don't even believe the hype in the description--FALSE ADVERTISING.",1383868800,,469,5.0256410256410255
2416964,2,B000BGS8KM,"I watched this one after I had seen ""Devotee"" (french independent movie, check out my next review).
There are two things these two share: they last less than 60 minutes and they are low-budgets. And that's it.
In case of ""Boystown"" everything is way too amatourish. I admit I expected something more elaborated (judging by the cover). Instead, I got a half-baked product.
The story line is so so. Bunch of gay friends and their problems. Lot of cliches. I cannot understand how come anybody could find it interesting and wonderful (vide those two more than positive reviews).
Acting is really nothing here. The gardener, even if I think he was the hottest and he earns the second star for it, then it's not diffucult to notice that he keeps smiling all the time (was he on high while filming???).
The drag performance...One of the worst I have ever seen. And it's one that was supposed to be directed...

To make it even worse, the film is bad edited. The sound has got bad quality, which is disturbing.
If I had to live in such town, I would have moved out within first hour.",1308787200,,1076,4.546391752577319
2416965,3,B000BGS8KM,"Before you buy or rent this you should know that it is NOT a film or a series but rather a pilot for a tv show, which Im assuming never got made. (I could be wrong, but I can find no evidence to the contrary). It is 51 min (6 of which are credits!) Its worth $1.99 for on demand but certainly not $20 to own!!!!
It is VERY low rent. It has a college film project vibe to it and actually has very little to do w/ Boystown at all. The acting is terrible (the semi-sexy landscaper/musician laughs all the time???!!) and includes the worst drag number ive ever seen. All the stereotypes are here, but with little nuance or character depth....so far. You and your gay pals grab a camcorder and reenact your favorite scenes from QAF, it'll be the same thing...probably funner!
And yet, somehow, by the end, you actually want to know more about these people and their lives.  Hmmm.",1293321600,6,874,4.329268292682927
8086615,3,B000BGS8KM,"The acting was not the best and some of the story lines were a little over-dramatic but, for an LGBT sitcom, it was OK.",1519084800,,119,4.0
8086616,2,B000BGS8KM,"OMG, really?  This is awful!  Badly written and directed.  The acting is atrocious.  No wonder it never made it past the pilot.  Very amateur and not worth watching AT ALL!",1506729600,,172,4.6
8086617,3,B000BGS8KM,The story line was ok.  It seems as if this movie was made on a tight budget.  Quality wasn't all that good.  Great looking cast.,1506124800,,129,4.08
8086618,1,B000BGS8KM,"This was soooo bad on so many levels- bad writing, bad plot, bad actors.  I hope this never became a regular series",1504051200,,115,4.2272727272727275
8086619,5,B000BGS8KM,"I remember when this came out, it caused alot of hype and made a film festival! They have talked about how they made it with a very small budget but it turned into someone of an occult back in the day. The show went on to get picked up for two seasons years later in Canada.",1504051200,,274,3.9107142857142856
8086620,1,B000BGS8KM,"I cannot believe I watched the whole show.  The actors would look off to the side trying to remember their lines then just saying their lines not acting.  Then again, they had a script which sounded like it was written by a 9th grader.  I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.  The director seemed to choose every position for the camera that he learned in community college and thus it because quite disjointed and distracting.  The music added nothing to the show.  I don't think I would want to be friends with any one of the characters.  At least I didn't have to pay for the show because it came with Prime.  Oh, and the Boystown title does a disservice to the real Boys Town.",1501891200,,688,4.362204724409449
