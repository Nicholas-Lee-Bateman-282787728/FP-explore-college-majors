Grosshouse is a prime example of the beauty of the imagination of indie filmmaking in both positive and negative ways. If a major studio got the pitch for an idea involving a movie that features a male impersonating a woman in the bathtub masturbating with a fish, I am pretty sure 911 would be called immediately. As the movie opens we meet Bertha who is female prostitute. She has a son named Marty and a daughter named Petunia. Marty is that socially awkward guy who is mistreated by his mom Bertha. This family is anything but normal, you have Bertha who as i said earlier is really a male. You have Petunia who lusts her brother Marty, and Marty who not only lusts his sister but helps his mom bury the people she kills. To call this film  experimental could be the badge of honor they were looking for. This film has that old school Troma humor of fart gags, and just absurd situations that only bring further absurdity. The John Waters reference comes from the daringness and brave face this film pulls off. This film tries very hard, but this film also seems very desperate in what it gives the audience.

Humor is a very hard thing to pull off, when it works you just know in your heart. Like if you are filming a scene and you laugh at it, but no one else gets it, you know you may be alone and to maybe work on it. This film had moments that I felt they thought were funnier than they actually were. The masturbating with a fish and all the fish jokes in this film were funny to an extent, but the more they harped on them, the less funnier they were. Who would think an overweight man in the tub pretending to be a woman french kissing a fish and then simulating penetration is funny? I mean, if you are you going to go for that effect, you have to fully commit. It would be like watching a porn and the guy is ready for sex, and the girl is naked under the covers. Showing an ass crack and farting on cue is not really funny or gross, it is just something that feels sophomore humor at best. There were so many open doors to explore in this film that do not need money or time. The scene with the brother and sister in the shower and mom doing what she did, looked way too fake. I get it, it is actually fake but you are supposed to make me suspend my disbelief. The film is not altogether bad, it does have moments. I said in the opening that the film is brave and creative, but this film needed a script and acting to help it out.

I know what did I expect from a film like this? I expected to be honest, to be grossed out or at least offended. This film played it daring but it also reeled itself back to try and convince people it could also be formulaic. I hate to attack this film, but I feel people are going to go into this film and expect it to be much more than it truly is. This film sort of reminds me of Brian Dortons Trashology. It has the same mentality, it wants to be shocking yet be likable. It wants every joke to be a home run when in reality, someone should have watched this in editing and just say,  can we work on this scene a little more and dial back on this one. I have seen people praise this film, but not tell me really any reason why they are praising it.  I loved that movie, future of indie film. Ok, what did you love about it.  Well, everything. I am going to be honest, this film is rough at times. This is not the future of indie film, actually the film came out a week ago, unless we go backwards, this film is pretty much right now. I am not on that train with those people who love it, but I am not on the boat with the people who hated it. I am in the middle. Star Meza has some potential, I loved how she fully embraced the slutty sister role. The nerd son just felt so fake and tried so hard to be funny. The drag queen mom, it was a missed opportunity overall. It could have been much more shocking and realistic. Instead it felt like a new director and a new actor trying to show people that they can deliver when clearly they were not actually fully ready to. The film has some moments, but it does get very long winded and drags. If you are into fish sex humor, and fish tacos, fish with gross ingredients, this could be your film. If you are into an actress who is hot playing an innocential slut, this could be your film as well. It is a decent try and I hate to be negative, but I have to be honest.",1467158400,,4494,4.1
