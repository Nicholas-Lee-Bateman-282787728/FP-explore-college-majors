7539047,4,B0183DMRVK,"Death Valley Days was a syndicated western anthology that aired for 20 seasons,from 1952 to 1970, as many seasons as Gunsmoke with various hosts over the years including Ronald Reagan,Rosemary Decamp,Robert Taylor and Dale Robertson. So while we're still waiting for season 12 of Gunsmoke and seasons 4 and 5 of Zane Grey Theater, this will have to do for now, season 1 has only 18 episodes, would have liked to have seen at least the first 2 seasons released together.

There are 3 DVDs with 6 episodes on each, In some of these episodes, the Old Ranger's voice is overdubbed with a younger voice. There's a lot of romantic tales in this first season, my favorite was The Little Bullfrog Nugget with Gail Davis, just before she became famous as Annie Oakley. All these episodes are based on true stories, great for nostalgia viewing, no real violence, just good story-telling

The following is the episode guide for season 1 , originally aired in 1952-3 with host Stanley Andrews, the Old Ranger. For the first two years the series was produced by Gene Autry's Flying A Productions

7539049,4,B0183DMRVK,"The episodes are at times entertaining, surprising, heart-warming, amazing or mysterious.  During the introduction to each episode, The Old Ranger declares the story to be ""true,"" yet the internal evidence suggests the episodes are highly fictionalized versions erected upon slim foundations of truth.  It's obvious virtually all the dialogue is made up, for no diary, autobiography, biography, or newspaper article--even if such were extant--would contain such detailed dialogue.  Death Valley Days eschews revealing its documentary sources, if any.",1517875200,,550,6.0256410256410255

7539057,5,B0183DMRVK,"This show premiered on TV in 1952, the same year ""Gunsmoke"" did, 65 years ago - when westerns filled the airwaves.  But ""Death Valley Days"" was never as showy as the other westerns.  Here you will find simple stories of human interest, the kinds of anecdotes that might be passed down in families through the years.  The show claims that all of its tales are based on actual happenings.  It is easy to believe they are.

I remember watching these shows when they came out.  (I was 5 years old.)  The shows as broadcast never looked or sounded this good in 1952.  I was amazed that they have been preserved and restored to such pristine condition.  They look GREAT on my 55-inch TV today.  The only downside is that the painted backdrops can now be seen so clearly that they no longer would fool any one.

I am having a great time re-discovering these old show.  I have already ordered Seasons 2 and 3.  I plan to get the first 11 Seasons, all the shows that have the original host, Stanley Andrews, as The Old Ranger.",1498262400,,1017,4.403225806451613

7539067,5,B0183DMRVK,"This is one of the most enjoyable western-theamed television series I have ever watched. They are short--24 minutes--and all true stories about life in the Death Valley region from the late 1800s to the 1950s. The video is excellent, with no discernible film degradation. The only drawback is they are in full-screen.

This series lasted 45 years--1930-1951 as a radio show then a television series from 1952-1970; and then rereleased with new narrative for an additional five years! In later series, Ronald Reagan narrated and starred in three episodes--his last acting before becoming Governor of California.

By-the-way, this series was filmed in Death Valley to advertise their sponsor, Pacific Coast Borax Company, makers of 20 Mule Team Borax which was mined there!",1488326400,,771,5.311475409836065

7539075,4,B0183DMRVK,"This is an entertaining series although it can seem somewhat repetitive at times. This is the first season so it may have improved later. At this point, however, I don't believe I will buy subsequent seasons. The price is high for the number of shows that you get. I got it because I grew up in the West in a town in the middle of desert-like country. The first episode deals with water and the lack of it. After living in the West this struck me as a very authentic story. I remembered The Old Ranger who introduces each episode. Some actors that I remember seeing in many tv shows appeared including Andy Clyde, Gail Davis, Jock Mahoney, Denver Pyle, Percy Helton, etc.",1474934400,5,671,4.463414634146342
