4531087,5,B0052T1EDQ,"I have waited for John Pinette to release a new DVD. I watched his TV special that was on in July on Comedy Central. This DVD is longer by 30 minutes, and is worth every penny. There is no other comic like Mr. Pinette who can make standing in a long unmoving line so funny. Alot of his bits are about food. There are no bad cuss words, except for one instance where he blurts out the F word. But that is a singlular incident so your kids can watch this. He has at least 2 other DVDs available: Say Nay Nay, and I'm Starving that are absolute musts.",1313971200,,548,4.036697247706422
4531088,4,B0052T1EDQ,"It's really not fair to rate John Pinette's latest work as a 4 star but when his previous work ""I'm Starvin'!"" was an over the top 5 star, ""Still Hungry"" falls a little short in comparison.  I laughed, but I didn't laugh until I cried.  Most of the DVD is new work, maybe 5% relates back to previously done skits.  I think the difference is that this DVD is funny but it's not as personal.  What I mean by that is that I could see myself reacting and ranting in chorus with John's ""I'm Starvin'!"" while ""Still Hungry"" left me outside looking in at John's skits.

Buy the DVD, you won't be disappointed.",1313712000,4,602,4.292035398230088
4531089,4,B0052T1EDQ,"We saw the show in Chicago and loved it.  So we ordered the DVD to share with friends and family.  But apparently the DVD is produced from the 2nd show he did here and at one point he screams the f-word, which was totally unnecessary.  I'm hesitant to share it with others because there seems to be a little more of that language in here than I remember from the show.  Too bad - that language is just not needed to make him funny!!",1313020800,2,432,4.107142857142857
4531090,5,B0052T1EDQ,I thought John Pinette's new video was hilarious.  My husband and I first saw him on our honeymoon cruise and we have loved him ever since. We have everything he's ever made.  In fact when my husband told me this was coming out I preordered it.  I actually thought there was a lot of new material but he incorporated some old punch lines into the new material.  You could tell the Chicago audience that was watching him knew his work.  If you love John Pinette you will like this one too.,1312675200,,488,4.318681318681318
4531091,5,B0052T1EDQ,"I type this review mentioning up front I'm a huge John Pinette fan and go out of my way to see him any time he comes to South Florida. I think both I SAY NAY NAY and I'M STARVIN are two of my favorite stand up releases on DVD. Was looking forward to his special on Comedy Central and while it was good, the DVD release of STILL HUNGRY blows it away. I would say almost slightly twice as long as the Comedy Central ""One Hour Special"" (which is no where close to one hour of jokes) and a ton of stuff that never made the TV version. It was like watching a Lord of the Rings Extended Edition the first time I watched it with all the new material. My girlfriend happens to be vegan and I loved that on the DVD Pinette does a bit on vegetarians and vegans, something which is cut out of the Comedy Central version.

Huge buy if you are a fan of good stand up. Pinette's act is solid and is something you can watch with anyone from aged 13-80 in the room. There's a lot of comedians I enjoy watching, but find myself uncomfortable if I'm watching with my niece and nephews or my parents. Pinette can be enjoyed by everyone and there's something to say for that.",1312675200,56,1155,4.110619469026549
4531092,5,B0052T1EDQ,"What a great routine this guy has developed. It's great fun, reasonably clean (he curses a couple of times during the act, but it's not really necessary), and he makes valid points. If you want to buy this, I would recommend getting his earlier videos first since there are a few references to jokes from those-- although not too many, and I think this video would stand pretty well on its own.",1312416000,,394,4.486111111111111
4531093,5,B0052T1EDQ,"Hilarious! The only issue is some of his jokes are old. I only say this because how I got onto JP was his joke about the toaster and gluten, and I was shown this about 3 years ago, somewhere, maybe youtube, or something. But then I saw his ""I'm Starvin'"" DVD and still no gluten jokes, so for about 2 1/2 years I thought I was hallucinating these jokes, till tonight, which is the first time this program aired on TV, and I saw them. But he does have alot of new jokes, so this is very highly recommended for JP fans! Enjoy as I did.",1311897600,6,533,4.037735849056604

Clean mouth, doesn't pick on any celebrity or politician - and has you rolling on the floor just laughing at his view of the obvious. The one about Bed, Bath and Beyond coupons is a classic.  Now when I go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond I actually want to ask people if they have a coupon - and if they don't have one I feel like putting my hand on their arm and saying, in a soft voice, ""Honey, you don't have a coupon?  Are you OK?  Do you know your name, do you know how to get back home?""  I was so sad when he passed away. We lost one of the funniest and most original comediennes in our country.

There are some repeated parts but because it's live stand up they're not exactly the same and there are still enough differences to enjoy having both.

If you are only buying one Pinette dvd then do yourself a favor and get ""I'm Starvin"". But if after you watch that one you realize that you just cannot get enough of Pinette. Then ""Still Hungry"" is a decent follow up. John's material is very limited (his weight, dieting, food) but he is creative in how he covers these limited topics. John's delivery is also unique and it is hilarious all by itself. John has does various accents to make his jokes even that much funnier.",1414800000,,644,4.375

John Finally delves into other areas, that always have a hook into something else further in the stand up that has to do with food. I have all of John's DVD's and some CD's, and have seen him in DC once also. I am amazed that a kid from Melrose Mass. can talk about food so much better than those Chef shows on TV, but I still don't like Turnips. You can't make me like turnips!! Nay Nay I hate them things!!
I bought the DVD from Amazon, and waited until Christmas day to show it at my house because my kids were home from College. They also LOVE John and his delivery, so as a family, dinner waited until we all stopped laughing from his show. The we were Starvin'!! John, this keeps your string going strong, and I look forward to seeing you live again.
I first watched I'm Starvin' when I traveled the country and couldn't sleep while on the West Coast, so I clicked on Comedy Channel and saw John on and finally bought the DVD, which includes bonus footage. My father, who was dying from Pulminary fibroids, literally could not breathe so we called 911. He was laughing so hard that his oxygen couldn't overcome his exhale!!
So when this came out, I HAD to send to my Mom, who enjoyed John along with my Dad. She was laughing so much from his show, that my sister sent me a video of her crying at his delivery.
Well, he West Coast actually did the same as I did- got all thier kids together and had a John-a-thon - watching I'm Starvin and Still Hungry back to back before eating Christmas Dinner.

4531290,3,B0052T1EDQ,"John Pinette is amazing. He manages to keep his comedy largely under the ""Good Clean Fun"" section, and still manages to be thousands of times funnier than every other comedian out there. I have seen ""I'm Starvin'"" about 20 times, and I genuinely laugh every single time. It really is a clean wholesome gem in a chaotic modern society.  Naturally, I was incredibly excited when ""Still Hungry"" came out in 2011.

Now, I didn't expect this to be better than I'm Starvin'.  That is a tough act to follow, but what I did expect 5 years after ""I'm Starvin'"" was new material. Still Hungry is 50% ""I'm Starvin"" with a few tweaks.  Five years is a long time to create 60 minutes of new material, and I'm not saying it's bad, because it's still hilarious, and if you haven't seen I'm Starvin', then you'll love it. But the dilemma occurs; If you're new to John Pinette, and the specials are largely the same, then why not just watch the better one?

This is the biggest issue I have with John...and again, don't get me wrong, I love him, and he is still by far my favorite comedian, but every time he comes around on tour and I think of going to see him, I know it's going to be the same material. Consider Jeff Dunham. Again, still don't like him more than John, but he has put out 5 specials in the same time, and the material is all new. I just don't see an excuse for half of your special to be recycled after five years between specials.

Examples from some of the recycled segments:

Shopping:

I'm Starvin' - Store card: ""Everywhere you go you have to have a store's club card""
Still Hungry - Coupon: ""Bed Bath & Beyond you have to have a coupon""

I'm Starvin' - Turnips bad: & ""I know Bacon, I think you know I know bacon""
Still Hungry - Arugula bad: & ""I know eggplant, I think you know I know eggplant""

Yoga:

I'm Starvin' - I went to a yoga class, they said, take your head and stick in your ass
  - They gave me a mat and said do what you can, so I left

Still Hungry - I went to a yoga class, they said, take your head and stick in your ass
  - They gave me a mat and said do what you can, so I took a nap

Salad:

I'm Starvin' - (On dieting) ""You can have all the salad you want. Oh you spoil me""
Still Hungry - (On Olive Garden) - ""They give you unlimited salad. Oh you spoil me""

Boring diets:

I'm Starvin' - No carb bread & no carb diet
Still Hungry - Low Carb Bread & Gluten free diet

Lines:

I'm Starvin' - Waiting in line: cruise ship, cold stone, mcdonalds, kfc
Still Hungry - Waiting in line: Rib festival

These are of course just quotes from the segments, and I know.....how much can you really say about food? But it's all pretty much the same bits and jokes with keywords changed here and there (i.e. turnips = arugula, Store Card = Coupon).  Lastly, he does drop the F bomb once. I really don't care if you curse, but I hate it when people do it just to do it, like when Seth McFarlane started making the Family Guy characters use the F word. It's just painfully forced and I just don't see why. If there is a purpose, then by all means, but if you're obviously just trying to fit an F bomb into your show just to say you said the F bomb in your show, I just don't see the point.

Still though, most of the fresh material is funny, and it's certainly worth a watch through. Just don't expect it to compare to I'm Starvin'.",1357171200,,3343,4.137770897832818

4531303,5,B0052T1EDQ,"This DVD is just candy for any John Pinette fan.  You just can't get enough of it.

John is one of those rare comedians who can talk about a single theme year after year and yet has audiences holding their sides.  He talks a lot about food.  You just never know where he's going with it.  He is hilarious to say the least.

Some of the topics in this one are the cake boss, Haggis in Scotland, Gluten story, the extended warranty, the toaster adoption and my favorite about the beavertail which he had to ice skate to get to....(I would say nay nay).  Why you ask, because a beavertail is fried dough covered in chocolate and M&Ms.  and being John, he wanted one.....bad..... nuff said... bedlam ensues.......

I couldn't wait to get my hands on this dvd, since I knew it was about a half hour longer than the Comedy Central special where they aired a condensed version of it in August 2011.  I hesitated to even watch the special on tv, because I knew I would be seeing John in person at the Sam's Town Casino in Tunica Ms. a few weeks later.  I couldn't resist.  I watched it all and was glad to hear some new material from John.  He is in rare form in this one.

I have two of his previous DVDs(I say Nay Nay & I'm Starvin) which are most excellent in their own right.  If you have those and are wondering about this one, it's just as good and perhaps a bit longer in length. It's an excellent value for the dollars.

It has some good extras. I especially enjoyed the part where he went outside a theater to meet some of his fans standing in the rain.  I can tell you from experience that he is most gracious when interacting with his fans.  There is not one bit of arrogance in him.

John has become famous talking about buffets and as fate would have it, on the day of his show, I was walking out of the casino into the lobby area next to the players club and the buffet, and there is John Pinette coming in the door.  I'm sure I couldn't wipe the grin off of my face as I approached him and I know he could tell he had been spotted.  He smiled and we shook hands.  I told him I was a big fan and I didn't expect to run into him before the show.  I had brought my two DVD covers with me in the hope I could get them signed. There I was speaking to him and didn't have them with me(dang it).  When I told him this, without blinking I swear he raised his voice and said (as only he could).... ""YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I WOULD BE AT THE BUFFET!!!"" and gestured to the entrance to the buffet 30 feet from where we stood.  Needless to say, I was in stitches and somehow the autograph didn't matter anymore.  I had a story to tell that I would never forget.  He smiled again and we parted.

Later that night, I went to the show with my dvd covers in hand hoping maybe I could catch him after the show.  Not only did he give us about an hour and forty minutes without hardly taking a breath so we could catch ours, I was in for another treat after the show.  We heard side splitting story after story. It was so funny.  That man ain't right!  He told some old stories and many new ones.  Some with a new twist which made them new again.  I was very entertained.

After the show, John came out the side door beside the stage and came right out in front of the stage and greeted people, signed autographs and took pictures for about 30-45 minutes, at least. When he posed for pictures, he always made the people posing laugh, because he would go into character and say things like ""You Go Now"", or ""Get out of the line"", or ""How big is a small?"".  Everyone laughed.  It was like getting a whole other show experience.  Needless to say, I got my two dvds signed and personalized with an inscription.  It's a night I will never forget.  On one of my dvds, he wrote ""You go now!!!  Best Wishes"" and on the other one he wrote ""The small is small, Best Wishes.  If you don't know what those inside jokes mean, you haven't heard enough of John Pinette and you should buy all three of his dvds today.  I have rarely seen a celebrity more concerned with making sure every fan who wanted to get the chance to meet and greet actually got it.  He was in no hurry.  It was very refreshing and will only serve to further endear him to everyone who was there that night.  I can't say he does that every night, as I have only seen him once.  I am sure some crowds would be too large, but I bet it's a regular activity for him.  I think he really enjoyed it as much as the fans.  He's just super.

For any on the fence about John Pinette, I would simply say this, experience his unique brand of raging comedy for yourself, whether on dvd or better yet in person.  Once you do that just once, I think you will be a fan for life.... as am I.  He's tops.  This DVD rocks.  Get it.",1345680000,12,4755,4.110869565217391

Gluton Free products  Buying a toaster and Hiking come to mind

I do think His Scotland story went on a little long and Bed Bath and beyond started out funny but I think at times he had to fill a time slot so he dragged it out

In reading other reviews I see reference to the F Bomb as people refer to it... One even said ""All the F Bombs""  There was one and I don't believe it was part of the script  I think he dropped it as an ad lib......It surprised me but it didn't bother me

John truly seems to appreciate the goodness of life, & you feel good sharing that with him. And his expressions are hilarious! Young and older alike in our family love him. God bless you John!

Seemed like he did a lot of YELLING instead of talking in this video. But it was funny.  New material.  I love this guy!  He's even better in person!!",1314316800,,208,4.15

4531343,3,B0052T1EDQ,"I first saw John while perusing my Netflix account, and I ran across his ""I'm Starvin"" special- I was in tears laughing the first time I viewed it, and I have watched it 5 times since, still laughing until I cry even though I know each time the material is a repeat venture. Obviously, when I saw his NEW DVD was out, I considered it a MUST-BUY!

""Nay Nay"" was my reaction. Speaking of which, he doesn't use ""nay nay"" at all in Still Hungry. I understand he wants to keep things fresh and not hack his previous material, but this time around, the laughs were more forced than natural.

My father hardly laughs at stand-up comedy. ""I'm Starvin"" gave my dad belly-laughs, 2 and 3 times around. He still requests to watch it with friends and family. When I told him I bought Pinette's new DVD, he was anxious to see it. He chuckled twice, the rest was silence, and there was a disgusted groan when John used the F-bomb. Just once.

I commend John for his clean comedy. It's hard to do nowadays in the society that we live in. Heck, even Jeff Dunham lets things rip when on stage with ventriloquist dummies (although I must say that a dummy using language makes his act unique, and it's half the reason why his act is funny). It's okay to let things slip, but the context John used wasn't appropriate, and it was not part of a joke. I am not new to stand-up and I laugh at Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Dave Chappelle, and countless other ""raw"" comedy acts, but John: I love you, man, but you could have done away with that on the DVD.

Will I give John another chance? Absolutely. No question.

I just hope he doesn't spoil his appetite next time.",1313971200,13,1645,4.3452768729641695
