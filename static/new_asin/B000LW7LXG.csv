8164641,3,B000LW7LXG,"If you need a light walking day this might amuse you for a while. I did one mile of walking and the band toning exercises and that was about 26 minutes of working out. Pretty close to a thirty minute exercise routine. If you have a toning band or weighted balls that might help. I did the workout without weights. I've been through a tough month of sickness, grief and who knows what else. It has been a trial. Now I'm trying to get back into working out out as much as I can and this was an easy way to get some exercise for the day.

If you don't want to walk the mile, do what you can and before long, you'll be able to do the entire mile. The time flies when you're working out. She is great.",1328140800,,255,3.923076923076923
8164644,5,B000LW7LXG,"This is a great exercise video for beginners to start with. Especially if you leave out the ""resistance"" for the first week or two. I bought this because I am pregnant and wasn't use to an exercise regimen. By exercising along with the 1 mile walk video I was able to build my stamina while keeping my heart rate at the recommended range for pregnant women. If your severely overweight, out of shape, older, or pregnant, this is a great video to begin with!",1267660800,3,457,4.4523809523809526
