I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she never gets tired of it, because we watch it almost everyday. This is also fun for the adults to do learn and do with your children. Definitely recommend!",1338854400,7,298,4.067796610169491
5036924,5,B006XHN99S,"My two-year-old daughter loves this music DVD! She has already learned a bunch of the songs. There is nothing like hearing my little girl wake up singing, ""I love you, Jesus!"" I bought this for the nursery at our church, but I will be buying another copy for home now. I'm so thankful to have something awesome like this for my little one!",1337040000,15,339,4.396825396825397
5036925,5,B006XHN99S,"Thank You Hillsong Kids, for putting out another fantastic dvd of praise and worship songs for kids! My 10yr old is a huge fan of Hillsong music, and loves Crazy Noise. The music videos are fun, and Funny Man Dan is super funny! We like the way the Bible verse is presented to kids... fun way to help Scripture stick! Its hard to pick a favorite song cause we love them all, but especially Life With Jesus, The Greatest Commandment, and the new remake of Let Your Light Shine.",1336521600,7,476,4.359550561797753

5036928,5,B006XHN99S,My girls love this DVD and watch it over and over. They know most of the songs by heart and love to dance along. The music is fun and the video is well done. There is also a cute story in the middle about loving who God made you to be. It's definitely directed more at younger kids but doesn't annoy me like some other kids songs.,1482796800,,330,3.9402985074626864

5036931,5,B006XHN99S,Our 17 month old (and even our 3 month old) loves this dvd!! Lots of smiling from this audience! Keeps them interested with video of kids dancing and singing. (It isn't cringe worthy for adults either),1474243200,,201,4.611111111111111

5036933,5,B006XHN99S,Three year old loves this. There's a guy in there that does silly things and has my son in stitches laughing.  Nice catchy music.,1471737600,,129,4.375

5036935,4,B006XHN99S,"I thought it was a music CD, as it was listed within the category when I searched. However, it was a dvd. That was my old complaint. Great for kids under 3.",1469318400,,156,3.90625
5036936,5,B006XHN99S,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves music! It was a little bit grown up for her (not meaning inappropriate), but she absolutely loves it. The songs are so uplifting! I find myself singing and dancing with her all the time. Definitely a great gift!",1468627200,2,280,4.403846153846154

5036941,4,B006XHN99S,We use this in Kids Church.  It's a cute DVD with songs and funny little skits.  I would not recommend this DVD if you use videos to lead worship in kids church.  This is more of a great video to play during free time/down time.,1462752000,2,228,4.022222222222222

5036943,5,B006XHN99S,"As an adult watching, I didn't think the video contained enough colorful movement and kid interaction to get my 2 year old's attention... BOY WAS I WRONG!!! She absolutely LOVES watching this video. I turn it on for her after dinner so she can wind down for story/bed time. *Family Favorite!*",1458691200,,292,4.745098039215686
5036944,5,B006XHN99S,"I love this DVD. We play it in the car and at home. Most of the songs don't get old, even after listening to them 100 times, like kids love to do. There is one, maybe two that annoy me but they're short. :-) The video quality isn't fantastic, but hearing my kids sing songs about loving God is worth it! They walk around singing these songs all the time!",1455494400,,354,4.071428571428571
5036945,2,B006XHN99S,These videos are not kid-friendly. They are boring the watch. The music is fine but if you want to buy something that toddlers or preschool kids can worship to then this is not it. You would be better off going with Yancy videos.,1452902400,,229,4.348837209302325

5036947,5,B006XHN99S,The most amazing DVD. Our little one loves music and movement and this dvd is full of it and the songs and storries are a great way to have your kids learn more about God and the bible. Hillsong never stops to amaze me and I wish they will come out with another Dvd like this soon ;),1448841600,,283,3.896551724137931
5036948,5,B006XHN99S,This is a great DVD for children to hear words of praise and sing songs! The characters get little ones attention. I ordered this for our toddlers at nursery at church and it was a huge hit. I highly recommend this.,1443225600,2,215,4.2682926829268295
5036949,4,B006XHN99S,"My children love this DVD. We moved to an area where video streaming is very limited and the closest church is much more traditional, so I wanted something to help ease the transition for them. They would give it 5 stars.
It's more of an entertainment DVD with worship incorporated into it, ultimately designed to lift up Jesus' name and bring joy.  After watching it and hearing it no less than 30 times in the past 2 months, the silly factor is grating on my nerves. There are times when the crazy noise could be toned down or the scripture memory could he done without the funny man Dan's distracting antics. That being said, I would recommend it for light hearted uplifting entertainment.",1441929600,5,692,4.626016260162602

5036951,5,B006XHN99S,"Awesome!!  I originally bought this for my 3 younger kids (3 years and 22 month old twins) but all 5 of my children loved it!  The older 2 who are 5 and 7 couldn't get enough!  They thought it was hilarious and tons of fun.  They got to sing some great songs and praise the Lord while learning some fun lessons at the same time.  Very few DVDs hold the attention of everyone and this one did it!  Highly recommended. I hope Hillsong Kids comes out with another ""junior"" DVD.",1438732800,3,474,4.211111111111111
5036952,2,B006XHN99S,We were disappointed because this DVD arrived broken.  My little granddaughter had learned these songs at her preschool. I was not sure how to return it and will look for it in the stores here.,1437350400,,193,4.514285714285714
5036953,5,B006XHN99S,Great video for little ones,1435536000,,27,4.6

5036955,5,B006XHN99S,"I ran across this while searching for better viewing options now that our vehicle has a DVD player. My boys (3 and 2) LOVE it! They frequently sing the songs and repeat things they've heard, like how strong they are and how God loves them. My three year old hums songs from this DVD while he's playing. I am so pleased that they are receptive to this program and it's helping plant the seeds of the Lord's word in their little hearts!",1432166400,2,434,4.304878048780488
5036956,5,B006XHN99S,I bought this to use for Toddler church that have prek-2 kids.  There were a couple of songs they could follow but the others are geared towards elementary age.  This does have motions that go to the songs which is what I was looking for....but most were a bit advanced for us.  But all the songs are great and the kids loved trying.,1430870400,,333,4.253968253968254

5036960,4,B006XHN99S,I bought this for my church's kids area for early elementary as a before-church and after-church filler.  The kids will sit down and watch it and seem to like it.  The adults like it too.,1421452800,,187,4.314285714285714

Can't say enough about this album just pray they make another one very soon!!!",1417737600,,439,4.714285714285714
5036965,4,B006XHN99S,"Bought this for Preschool Sunday School so we could sing some songs at the beginning of class.  I haven't used it that way, because it more like a 30 minute ""show"" with songs mixed in.  I plan to use it for a special event where the kids need some down time.  The songs are originals and full of energy (but not anything our kids would know) and the silliness is a little cheesy but I'm sure the preschooler would enjoy it!  All in all, not a bad purchase.",1414368000,,456,4.1477272727272725
5036966,5,B006XHN99S,"My son absolutely loves both the cd and the dvd. I ordered the DVD by mistake and when it came in I was going to return it. A few days later my son asked to watch it and he has been hooked ever since. He sometimes watches it 3 or 4 times a day!!!
I also teach praise and worship at a Mothers Day Out program at church-the kids range in ages from 12 months to 3 and they all love the songs too!!!",1413849600,,395,3.7142857142857144

5036974,5,B006XHN99S,"This DVD is loaded with unique uplifting songs that are kid friendly and that will make worshiping the Lord a joy.  Songs show lots of happy children dancing and jumping and having fun while focusing on God.  If you are fans of The Wiggles and Yo Gabba Gabba, then this has that same excitement.  Also contains short clips and scripts that are fun too but God centered. Words are on the videos so you can sing along.  Great resource for church, home church, childrens' church, toddlers and even your own personal time with your children in your home.  Can't say enough about the awesome products that Hillsong KIDS produces.  Highly recommend.",1398384000,,643,4.747747747747748

I am a worshipper in my church and my three yr old son is a worshipper at heart. Just last night in bed he began to sing be strong and very courageous and said, ""mommy I want to sing that song in church.""  He is no longer begging me to see his freshbeat band dvds instead he keeps asking me to see this dvd which I find much more beneficial because it is music that speaks to my son's heart and shows him how wonderful and fun it can be to sing and praise God.

So I was looking for Christian material to entertain her with and was glad to find something specifically for toddlers. This DVD has different types of music videos, a reading of a story (about accepting yourself), scripture learning, skits about children in the Bible and other crazy skits, prayer, and a goodbye song. These are all set in the overall story of a girl who finds an ipad in the mail, brings it home, and pushes the play button to see all the music videos and other items. Interspersed are clips of the same girl watching the videos on the ipad and following the directions on the ipad to make a paper lantern with her mother.

The music videos are all very creative: some with graphics so you can read the words, some with kids/adults dancing, some with just the lead singer, one with small people (like Honey I Shrunk the Kids). There is also one with cut-outs of people's heads moving against a still background. The music and singing are terrific, and the songs are good quality and generally well written. The lead singer is usually an adult woman or two women. The costumes are all bright and colorful, and there are also two crazy costumed characters that appear to be children (an adult wearing a costume to look like cartoon kids). The scripture learning usually shows a guy making faces, reading it word by word in a silly way that only little kids would love - sometimes misreading and re-reading the words, which actually gets you to remember the verse easily. The main scripture seems to be ""Make your light shine so that others will see your good work and praise your father in heaven."" Obviously, since this was made by Hillsong in Australia, the characters all have a little bit of an accent, but there's no problem in understanding them.

Just two negatives here. One is the lip syncing - when you hear a a man ""singing"" but hear a woman's voice. The second negative is the Crazy Noise video. The lyrics state, ""Make a crazy, crazy, joyful noise. A wacky sounding noise that you enjoy... so everybody knows that you're praising the Lord."" I'm uncomfortable with the idea that making any crazy noise you want (grunting, squealing like a pig, etc) will lead other people will know that you are praising God. I don't believe that is the meaning behind the verse about making a joyful noise to the Lord. Thankfully, my kid hasn't started making any weird sounds and sings along with the song in a nice way. In fact, she just loves to sing and dance along to all the songs on the DVD. I enjoy watching it and singing it as well (way better than getting your head stuck with the Little Mermaid!). And of course, I love that she's learning scripture and enjoying praise songs. And yes, she also sings ""I love you Jesus"" all the time too.",1345939200,20,3214,5.096774193548387
