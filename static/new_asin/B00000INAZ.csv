1229053,4,B00000INAZ,"This is a very good workout; for the most part it's easy to follow, thanks to Karen's perfect cueing, and it's not your run-of-the-mill toning video. She's solo throughout the entire workout, making it easy to follow her and concentrate on proper form. She does use a body bar (for balance) and weighted balls, but you can just as easily hold onto a chair or wall and use dumbells. The set is weird; I find it a bit distracting with huge drapes, and there are a few bad camera angles (nothing major). The first two segments are toning routines and the last segment, my favorite, is a stretching/yoga routine. Although this isn't my favorite Karen Voight video (I like some of her earlier weight training videos better), she seems like she's really enjoying herself in this video. Sometimes she has a tendency not to look very enthusiastic in her workouts, although I'm glad she's not one of these way too perky instructors who whoops and hollars all the time. My aunt has been to several of her classes and she says Karen is a very pleasant person, and her classes are always packed (when she's actually there). I'm glad she's just as professional in her videos, and this one should be in your rotation.",1115337600,3,1203,4.626168224299065
1229054,4,B00000INAZ,"I was a bit disappointed at first because I was expecting more cardio, but I really like it because it's different.  I specifically chose a Karen Vioght DVD because I liked her in Elle McPherson's Personal Best.  All parts of your body get a good workout.  This DVD introduced me (briefly) to yoga and I didn't know how hard it can be to hold those poses!  Some of the exercises are hard to do without the weight balls that Karen uses in the DVD.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because if you do the p.m. section on it's own (without doing a.m. first) there is no warm up.  I have found that I get a better workout now after doing it for a couple months because I am more familiar with the moves and probably perform them with more accuracy (using better form).",1107993600,4,773,4.224489795918367
1229055,4,B00000INAZ,"Man, I was sore the next day. But I know once I'm able to do the whole thing, and all the reps with her, I will be in shape. The steps are kinda tough to get (especially the double punch and kick thing), but I think after trying a few more times I'll get it down. I don't give it the fifth star for the reason of the camera shots. They switch back and forth sometimes which can be visually confusing, and they did this blur thing when I was trying to get one of the steps right... But she vocally cues everything well, especially during the yoga section (I hate it when I'm in the downward facing dog position for too long because the instructor hasn't said to switch - and hi! I can't see you!) Overall a very challenging video - and that's the point right?",1088726400,6,758,4.128378378378378
1229056,5,B00000INAZ,"This is my first Karen Voight workout DVD and I really enjoy doing it! I've done several other workouts and after a while I'd loose interest in them. With Karen though, I have felt and seen immediate results! I look forward to working out every morning and evening! She keeps you moving, focused and motivated!!! I have benefitted greatly from both the AM and PM workouts.
 I would definately recommend this to anyone who is tight on time, but wants the benefits of long hours at the gym. Enjoy!!!!!~",1087948800,3,500,4.617977528089888
1229057,5,B00000INAZ,"If I had to choose my top three exercise tapes to bring to a desert island, this video would definitely make the list.  It's a wonderful blend of traditional strength training, pilates-type ab work, and yoga stretches.  Instructor Karen Voight--who has an absolutely amazing body--adds unique twists to all of the above, and the end result is a flowing, enjoyable workout.
Karen begins with a warm-up that lasts approximately 7 minutes; she effectively stretches and warms both the lower and the upper body.  The 23-minute segment that follows is full-body strength training using light weights (Karen uses fitness balls but displays how dumbells can be substituted).  Although there are many traditional movements such as bicep curls, squats, and lunges, Karen frequently combines the exercises to make them more interesting and effecient--for example, a bicep curl combined with a plie squat.  Most of the moments are very focused and intense, and the number of repetitions is generally low (1-2 sets).  Karen finishes out the strength section by using a body bar for balance (a chair can be substituted) to do some targeted thigh and buns work.  Finally, there is a brief full-body stretch to end the first half of the tape.
Karen removes her shoes for the remainder of the workout.  The second half of the video begins with abdominals work.  This section is the most challenging abs work I have ever encountered; you will really FEEL the results the next day.  Again, Karen utilizes traditional moves such as crunches, but she makes the exercises tougher by adding weights, pulses, and isometric contractions.  She follows the abs work with back extensions to ensure that both sides of the body are thoroughly stretched.  The last part of the tape is approximately 25 minutes of yoga-type stretches.  Karen performs a series of moves on one side of the body, including forward bend, triangle pose, lunge, and proud warrior, and then she repeats the entire series on the other side.  A few additional poses are performed on the floor, including table and reverse plank.
This workout never fails to leave me feeling wonderfully refreshed.  Karen is an excellent instructor who provides flawless mirrored cuing; she is warm and friendly while also being calm and focused.  The workout is filmed in three different settings (a studio, a living room, and outdoors) and switches amongst them, and a soft jazz soundtrack plays in the background.  I highly recommend this workout for all fitness levels (with the exception of absolute exercise beginners).",1071705600,77,2551,5.108433734939759
1229058,5,B00000INAZ,"I've had this video for a while but I never got around to doing it, so yesterday I decided to do it & I must say that it is amazing! The upper body workout with the weights made my arms feel tight, I normally workout  with 5 lb. weights but I had to switch to 3 lb. weights after a while.  You  really don't need the weighted balls that are featured, your hand weights  will still give you a great workout.  The first workout is about 23 mins.  long & it does move pretty fast so watch the video before doing it.  If  you can, turn your t.v. so that it is facing a mirror & it will help  you keep up with the 1st workout.  The seond workout is for the abs &  back with some yoga.  My abs felt so tight after doing this!  I've never  really tried yoga because I thought it was difficult, but Karen's cuing is  perfect & she explains how to do the moves so anyone can do them.  You  can always do the workouts separately or together for a full body workout.  During the yoga segment she has you do some push ups & I kid you not,  you will feel the burn!  Afterwards though you will feel so relaxed &  refreshed.",963273600,28,1109,3.9726027397260273
1229089,3,B00000INAZ,"On-line they're tougher to come by to shop for. Also, I'm slender & under 5'4"" so my hands are... well youth sized (tiny!). She does have somewhat fast paces (unlike the other dvds of Karen's that I've owned & used for years) with dance like moves. 3lb toning balls are almost 5"" around.

The dvd was affordable but shopping for even 2lb toning balls are tougher along with the shipping cost- YIKES!

Karen always has excellent production in her videos & instructions with helpful cues to keep form/keep going.

Unfortunately- this one just isn't for me.",1350432000,,554,4.75
1229090,5,B00000INAZ,"Very good workout for your upper body, and cardio.  The PM that actually is the down time of the workout has very good abdominal and ended with yoga stretch. Very effective!!  Also, the seller was excellent good product, and services fast.",1312934400,,239,4.804878048780488
1229091,5,B00000INAZ,"I have used The Body video with Elle MacPherson and Karen Voight on and off for years and wanted another workout with the same effectivenss and  easy-to-follow instructions.  The AM workout is perfect, only 25 mins long but quite tough if done with weights and very effective.  Very pleased with it.",1267142400,4,299,4.823529411764706
1229092,5,B00000INAZ,"This is a great workout video.  Eventhough it includes two workouts, I usually stick to the AM workout, which focuses on upper and lower body toning.  I love that I can get a total body workout done in a half hour and feel like I have accomplished something.  You will not build much or any muscle with this workout, but it is great for weight loss and toning.  I always have so much energy when I do this video on a regular basis.

I have used this video when I have been at a variety of fitness levels and have always gotten something out of it.  It's a great video when you are trying to get in shape, lose weight and tone your body.  Like her other videos, this one is very effective and you see results right away.  I have also used this video as a compliment to heavier resistance training, to maintain muscle tone and endurance.  I am now 6 months pregnant and the AM workout has been absolutely perfect, since all of the exercises are done standing up.  I purchased videos specifically for pregnancy, but got rid of them all since I liked this one so much more.  You won't reget this purchase.",1256947200,5,1101,4.296116504854369
1229093,5,B00000INAZ,"This DVD really is a wonderful DVD with two routines, one for the morning and one for the evening, which blend a variety of different moves and exercises in two workouts tha really works you out.  Stretching, ab work, and poses to exercise you arms and legs.  It is all here.",1248912000,,275,4.372549019607843
1229094,5,B00000INAZ,"This video doesn't always leave me sore, but finishing it is difficult for me *every time*.  Now, let me tell you that despite that there is *absolutely NO dread factor*!  LOVE Karen Voight~she's beautiful, fit,  knowledgeable, and an excellent instructor.  This is my favorite video of hers and one that I reach for cosistently amidst the very many on my shelf.  ETA that I've always used 3lb dumbbells in place of the toning balls very successfully.  :)",1233446400,5,455,4.8441558441558445
1229095,4,B00000INAZ,"The A.M. routine is pretty killer--it's fast-paced and gets your blood pumping immediately, which can be a little tough if you've just woken up. The workout centers around using either weight balls or hand weights(your choice). And lifting weights is what it's all about. I only did this portion of the video for a couple of weeks and noticed a significant difference in the sculpture of my arms.

The P.M. routine pounds your abs with modified pilates moves for about 15 minutes before switching to yoga. I didn't like the PM routine as much, but that might be because I'm not a fan of yoga. The ab workout portion felt good, although exhausting.

The video production values are cheesy--the music is kind of lame and the inter-cutting of grainy black and white footage with color footage seems amateur. The P.M. backdrop is downright hilarious with the moon painted on a scrim. But the exercises are strong, and Karen Voight remains a good DVD teacher. The 25 min. A.M. workout in particular is great and worth every penny.",1222732800,3,1025,4.785310734463277
1229096,4,B00000INAZ,"I bought this video at fye for like 5 dollars a really long time ago.

(God was the key motivator). I have another 40 lbs to go so, I am increasing the number of Streamline Fitness workouts to 5x week for optimal health and success.  Positive beautiful gracious Karen Voight makes working out a happy anticipation rather than a dreaded duty.

1229098,5,B00000INAZ,"This is a great exercise dvd for home.  The A.M. exercise is done with 3-lb weights for total body workout.  The P.M. exercise emphasizes on ab, using 3-lb balls.  You can do both programs straight through.  Anytime I have a huge meal the night before, I always take out this dvd the following day.  Karen Voight's fitness programs are all very do-able.  If at first you can't catch up, just keep doing it.  You will like the result you see in the mirror.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1192924800,2,485,4.431818181818182

1229111,5,B00000INAZ,"I really like this workout and love Karen Voight.  As others have said, she is wonderful--good with her cues and very pleasant to workout with.  I own ""Sleek Physique"" and was looking for a little variety so I thought I would try this DVD out. It's a tough workout for me and I REALLY feel it the next day.  I love that between the A.M. and P.M routines it's a full body workout and that you can combine the A.M. and P.M. into one longer workout or do them separately.  The only thing I wish was that there was a bit more cardio work.  It's great strength training but I don't feel like I'm getting my heart rate up too much.",1181347200,4,625,4.132231404958677
1229112,5,B00000INAZ,I just recently discoveren Voight's DVDs and I was pleasantly surprised. I really like them because they are so easy to follow and artistically well done. It is something nice to look at while working out. I do appreciate a beatiful way of creating a fitness DVD as a work of art not just sweaty workout scene. I wish more of them were like that.,1171411200,4,346,4.338461538461538
1229113,5,B00000INAZ,"I love this workout,its great and it burns fat,you can do the strength training and yoga or both. I usually do the strength training you never out grow it,just increase the wieghts. The strength workout only takes twenty-five minutes,or you can do the whole thing (one hour).

1229116,5,B00000INAZ,"I got this for Christmas in the Body Sculpting Kit.  I am a former aerobics instructor and personal trainer who no longer lifts weights- only yoga and pilates.  That said, I did not want the green genies in the kit, but after doing this workout I really like it!  It is fast and it burns.  The first workout has an energizing warm-up and then goes into a fast series of exercises with the green genies- I was sweating and I felt the burn.  The second workout really gets your abs and is a great workout for the lower back- great core conditioning.  Then it ends with some wonderful yoga stretches.  This is a great total body conditioning video (there is no cardio!) and I love the fact that it is broken into two 30 minute workouts.",1136073600,7,733,4.345588235294118
1229117,1,B00000INAZ,"I did not enjoy this video at all. Yes Voight has a wicked body and is obviously in peak condition, but I found her moves to be way too bouncy and devoid of sufficient warm up. I am quite fit and would have liked to have had more of a build up to the exercises in the first section. As for the relaxation session for the PM it was just soooooooo dull !

Lack of variation really turned me off.

I also found seeing the camera switch from the studio to her jumping around in front of a settee really ridiculous.

Only for die hard fans I would say, though I am sure many would disagree. I simply detested it.",1130544000,3,607,4.041666666666667
1229118,4,B00000INAZ,"This workout moves fast!  Not in a bad way that's too hard to keep up with, but enough that after several times, i'm still not sick of it.  My only complaint would be that I'm not totally sore the next day - but it really is a great way to start your day and passes 30 mins for a workout really quickly!

2 30 min segments - one for am the other for pm.  The am workout is mostly cardio and some free wieghts - she really moves you quickly through the workout without too many dance moves, yet fast enough to be interesting.  The pm workout is a really amazing ab workout.  It took a few times before I could get through the whole thing!

7911522,4,B00000INAZ,"I did this workout for the first time today, and I absolutely loved it. I have several Karen Voight DVDs, and I must say this is among her best (the very best is probably Great Weighted Workout, as it's killer in the best way, while still being fun).

AM section: I loved the inclusion of weights, and I loved all the squats! This is basically a strength training workout, but it still gets your heart rate up enough to break a good sweat. It was enjoyable, and engaging the whole way through. I loved the inclusion of 2-3 lb hand weights (I used 3lbs for most of it). I loved that, unlike many beginner workouts, I could really feel this working.

PM section: Karen slows things down for this one, but it is still super effective for toning. Admittedly, I couldn't get through all the ab work, but it gives me something to work up to. I definitely felt my core getting an excellent workout. Push-ups, downward dog, and a number of stretches follow. They are all excellent, and challenging without being daunting.

I strongly recommend this DVD to beginners (exercisers of 2 months or less), who want a challenge but don't yet have enough upper body strength to get into plank/do mountain climbers for several minutes. I strongly recommend doing both sections if you can, like I did, as it was extra rewarding when I was done.",1380067200,2,1326,4.563025210084033
7911523,5,B00000INAZ,"This DVD contains two workouts - when my time is limited and my energy level is low, I do the Energizing Workout which lasts 25 minutes. The music is light jazz, and the workout includes a smooth, quick-paced warm up which is easy to follow. The warm up is followed by upper and lower body toning which can be done with weighted balls, or light hand weights. The upper body toning segment is continuous without any breaks; for this reason I do feel some muscle fatigue even though I'm using lighter than usual hand weights. It is the perfect, energizing solution for days when longer, high intensity work-outs just aren't going to happen.  On days that I feel exhausted, this workout always provides a boost - it truly lives up to its name!",1358553600,3,740,4.56390977443609
