8732005,5,B014VVNRB2,It was very educational without being boring.  And it stayed on the subject of the missing ships and crew.  The timing was great of when it came out which co-insides with the finding of the Erabus.,1473033600,2,197,4.444444444444445

8732008,3,B014VVNRB2,"In 1845, a British ship crew went into the northern part of Canada to find the Northwest Passage to the Pacific Ocean.  No 1 ever heard of the crew again.  This documentary discusses a successful attempt to find more.  Sensitive viewers must be careful as this doc shows dead bodies and speaks of cannibalism.
The program said this was the sixth attempt by the searchers here.  The waters this far north are frozen ten months out of the year.  However, I liked that this program doesnt pat itself on the back about surviving danger as many other documentaries would.
The key to so much information came from Inuits.  A male and female Inuit were interviewed here.  Their oral tradition is what helped to find the sunken ship.  The program never mentions global warming and I wonder if so much of this frozen area is all wet, and environmentally messed up, now.
The program said the last sailors did reach the Northwest Passage.  I felt like this was revisionism.  The ships did not make it to the Pacific Ocean.  Their travels were never used as a shortcut to trading posts in China, Japan, and India.  I don't think I would conclude with mission accomplished.
The work never mentions the 1996 film Titanic, but that came into my head as I watched this.  The searchers used a torpedo to find the sunken ship similar to what Snoop Dogg did in the Cameron film.  Viewers who enjoyed this documentary should also see those on the Greeley Expedition and the missions to scoop Spanish gold from the waters off of Florida.",1441324800,2,1516,4.629213483146067
