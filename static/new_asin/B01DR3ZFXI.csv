8756702,1,B01DR3ZFXI,A complete waste of PBS monies!  A sensational title to titillate prurient interests.  Ask yourself how secret was this relationship?  It does not appear that either party tried to hide the relationship.  Seems that the authors / directors cannot fathom an intellectual relationship.  Bernstein comes closest to getting it right--nothing illicit in the relationship in spite of the authors attempts to paint it that way.,1468108800,5,420,5.4
