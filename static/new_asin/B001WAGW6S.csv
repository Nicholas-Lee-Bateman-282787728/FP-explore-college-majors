8347295,1,B001WAGW6S,"This item was misleading and is worthless unless you understand French. The product picture does not even display that it is French only, product picture shows everything in English. Worthless product, disappointed child, shame on the seller.",1454803200,2,242,5.5675675675675675
8347296,1,B001WAGW6S,"I purchased this CD, and I received it Spanish. What a bummer. I won't do that again. That was a terrible experience. Tried to return it for an english version, and the company wouldn't take it back.",1380672000,4,199,4.405405405405405
8347297,4,B001WAGW6S,"I'm not a card game fan, however, the Chaotic series was interesting.  I think this is what
Yugi-Oh tried and rather failed to do.  Bringing two worlds together by way of a game, with the players becoming their creatures and doing the battle themselves.  That's a fantasy a lot of people can relate to; competition on a multi-dimensional scale without that ""win or die"" or ""terrible destiny"" theme. The strategy is fun to watch and at the same time, the stories don't take themselves too seriously, making this series very enjoyable.",1343260800,,533,4.835164835164835
