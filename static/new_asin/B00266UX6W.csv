3852627,4,B00266UX6W,"very good movie.  It does actually play in my dvdram and vhs recorder.  I didn't realize until after I ordered it, that it may not play on a dvd recorder.  The movie is very clear, even the preview. But, alas there are no closed captions. I am not deaf, but have hearing difficulties. I know I will enjoy it, but will have to really pay attention to hear everything.",1260403200,,366,4.27536231884058
3852628,5,B00266UX6W,"""This Woman Is Dangerous"" continues Joan Crawford's foray into her Warner Brother's melodrama period, but it falls short of being nothing more than a movie starring Joan Crawford. The movie just doesn't jell. A shoddy story of a woman, played by Crawford, who is a female gangster who is trying to abolish her past and change her ways. Crawford runs through her scenes and the viewer can tell she is not enjoying herself in this role. There is no direction to speak of and the script is pretty dull. This movie doesn't feature any melodramatic scenes that are evident in other Crawford 1950's films, but it is wonderful that this rare gem has finally found a home on the home video market. As some reviewers have ponted out Warner Brother's has released over a dozen never-before-released titles of Joan's on DVD through their website. Among the other rare titles available are ""Mannequin"", ""Ice Follies of 1939"", ""The Shining Hour"", ""Possessed"" with Clark Gable"", and ""Goodbye, My Fancy"". All the titles look great with the exception of ""Possessed"", as the film looks grainy and dirty at times.
 ""This Woman Is Dangerous"" would be Joan's last Warner Brother's film until ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" in 1962. ""This Woman"" would be followed by Joan's Oscar nominated role in the excellent ""Sudden Fear"", in which she co-starred with Jack Palance. In 1973 when asked by an interviewer what her worst film was Joan admitted to detesting ""This Woman Is Dangerous"". She also told her biographer Roy Newquist, ""I must have been awfully hungry. I guess I was. Kids in schools, the house...nothing was right about ""This Woman Is Dangerous"". A shoddy story, a cliche script, no direction to speak of. The thing just blundered along. I suppose I could have made it better, but it was one of those times that I was so disgusted with everything I just shrugged it off and went along with it. That is unforgivable isn't it?""
 This movie also features no bonus features and comes in standard form.",1246060800,4,1989,4.829912023460411
3852629,5,B00266UX6W,"This is a great movie and I am sure that many people will expound on that, what I wanted to write about is that you can get this movie $10 cheaper by ordering directly from Warner Brothers Archive Store, just Google it, it will come up. I cannot believe a store like Amazon that pride itself on offering the best prices is charging 28 when you can get it for 19 from the manufacturer directly.",1243900800,,393,4.253333333333333
3852630,3,B00266UX6W,"This is another of the Warner Archive releases.  Be warned, this will not play on pc's or player/recorders.  It will only work on ""play only"" machines.  I'm thrilled that attention is being given to these titles but I can't help but wish that, for the price, they played on all equipment.  I'm fortunate enough to have a second viewing set-up but for those who don't it wll be frustrating not to be able to play these titles.",1243296000,7,425,4.48051948051948
3852631,3,B00266UX6W,"Who writes these descriptions? ""This Woman is Dangerous"" was never considered a classic. I wouldn't even consider it a cult-classic (like ""Johnny Guitar"", ""Torch Song"" or ""Harriet Craig""). Instead, it's a little-known picture that most of Joan's newer generation of fans (anyone under 25, like myself) have likely never seen because it has never been released on any format until now.

After a string of unsuccessful films, this was Joan's final contracted Warners picture as she decided to branch out on her own. And Joan must have known best, because directly after ""This Woman is Dangerous"" she made one of her defining pictures, which was nominated for an Oscar, ""Sudden Fear"".

In this film, Joan plays Beth Austin, a gangster who goes out of her way to erase her past after meeting a new man. The film is very mundane and somewhat forgettable because none of the scenes are overly dramatic, nor does it have that over-the-top essence that many of Joan's pictures of the late '40s and '50s usually always had. The film is a total of 95 minutes in length.

As I have already stated, these are standard DVDs that Warner Home Video put out earlier this year through their site. You will find them for much less if you buy them directly from the studio. You can also catch this movie as it is shown on TCM from time to time, but do yourself a favor and don't buy from this site as the price has been completely inflated to make you think that you're getting a rare and otherwise unattainable item.

""This Woman is Dangerous"" reminds me of a hybrid-carbon copy of ""Possessed"" (1947), ""Flamingo Road"" and perhaps even ""The Damned Don't Cry"". Joan once commenting on this film much later into her 6-decade career, saying, ""I must have been awfully hungry. I guess I was. ...A shoddy story..."" Joan still gave a great performance, but by now the studio had totally written her off as evidenced by her lackluster costars, scriptwriters and director. She managed to still pull it off while carrying the entire burden of yet another signature-Joan Crawford movie on her substantial shoulders.

8352196,3,B00266UX6W,"A very mediocre film -- not terrible, but certainly not good. Joan Crawford as a gun moll? Not a realistic premise to begin with. She is with a gang of crooks, one of whom she is supposedly in love with. He is insanely jealous of her associating with any other men. Crawford is having eye problems and is told by an eye doctor that "" she will be blind within a week"". OK-- again, this stretches credulity. But, there is one eye doctor who is performing an experimental procedure which may save her eye sight. She travels there, and he briefly looks at her eyes and surgery is scheduled for the next day. Again-- this is all ridiculous: medical operations, experimental or not, certainly do not happen like that in real life, certainly. Not even in fairy tales. Not in 1952, not today.

During the course of the film, this eye doctor also performs emergency surgery on an injured boy (in the parent's living room!) and is called to save a dying patient at a women's prison (she dies). Why is an eye doctor summoned to save a dying woman? I have no idea. Even in 1952, eye doctors did not (to my knowledge) perform surgeries or life-saving procedures that had nothing to do with eyes. This film is simply very klunky in portraying reality and moving the story forward with any sense of believability.

There are many inconsistencies in this film. Just one:  the gangsters kill a cop, and take the body in their RV trailer, then abandon the trailer. This abandoned trailer clearly links the gangsters to the killing. It makes no sense that the gang would leave such an obvious trail. Again, this shows a very klunky script -- as if it were written in a matter of hours! It's that silly and nonsensical!

The film's script is definitely a piece of crap. The general plot has merrit, and could have been fleshed out in a believable way, had someone put in minimal effort. The acting was generally good. But, the idea that the doctor was smitten and in love with Crawford was not portrayed believably.

Some interesting relics of 1952 are on display, though. For example, the FBI fire a machine gun (Tommy gun). I can't recall ever seeing a machine gun in a film beyond the 1930's gangster era. But, I guess that the FBI still had them in 1952. Also, plenty of cigarette smoking in the hospital, even in the observation deck overseeing the operating table.

This film is Not a must-see.",1519084800,,2380,4.549065420560748

8352201,4,B00266UX6W,"This film was rather slow.  Having said that,  ANYTHING with Crawford interests me.  Her screen presence and acting ability are just wonderful to watch.  That's my opinion,  however.  If you're looking for a mediocre film with Joan Crawford to entertain you:  this is the film.  If you're not a Joan Crawford fan,  I would skip this one.",1396396800,3,337,4.771929824561403
8352202,5,B00266UX6W,"Joan Crawford readily admitted that this was the one film of hers that she disliked the most.  As much as I like Joan Crawford, she was not the best judge of her own work.  This is a fun, action packed, Warner Brother's romp, with Joan as a criminal mastermind.  There's more; she has a medical condition, a handsome doctor, and a jealous lover.  You have to experience it, to appreciate it.  This is one of my favourite of Joan's Warner Brother's pictures.",1388534400,5,457,4.524390243902439
8352203,2,B00266UX6W,"one does NOT think of Felix E. Feist.

When we think of MGM, we think of Gable. Crawford, Harlow, Shearer, Hepburn, Garland, Garbo, Tracy, Rooney.  With the exception of one, all of those mentioned went on to better, or worse, things, after MGM.  Life will go on.

Joan Crawford, no bones about it, will stay.  To hell with retirement and vaudeville shows and independent production companies and untimely deaths.  She's here.  She wanted a long-term contract and got it.  And this is the end of it. And she'll never let you forget it.

Joan Crawford, never really an actress, is a cement block in this movie.  She drowns it.  She overpowers it.  And like so many Crawford films after MGM, here's why: there is no Gable.  No Tracy.  No Robert Montgomery.  No John Barrymore.

Warner Brother's tried.  John Garfield (Humoresque) and Van Heflin (Possessed).  20th Century Fox gave her Henry Fonda (Daisy Kenyon) but after that, all hell broke loose regarding Crawford.  There were really no LEADING MEN left, and none that wanted to work with her.  (Sterling Hayden?  Zachary Scott?  Jack Palance?).

So Joan Crawford was given carte blanche by studio heads and directors and casting agencies and script writers to devour anyone and anything that stood in her way for a ""performance"".  She will chomp the script, the innuendos, the clothes, the walls, the chairs, the automobiles and the men. A well dressed shrew with an overly aging bone to pick.  For such a smart woman, she certainly can hold a grudge.

Dennis Morgan doesn't stand a chance against this bulldozer.  Who is Dennis Morgan, anyway????

It's ""A Woman's Face"" meets ""The Damned Don't Cry"" and it's awful and Crawford's last full tilt boogie at Warner Brother's.

After this, she went home and beat up Christina, said ""OK"" to ""Sudden Fear"", drank vodka all night long, fired the maid and FINALLY did something with the doilies on her sofa that her beloved mama sent over.  Ye gads.",1368144000,,1944,4.820668693009119
8352204,5,B00266UX6W,I loved This Woman Is Dangerous ! And admit that I am a fan of Joan Crawford. As a tough girl in this film she puts it over very well. Probably would be a B film but not really from Joan's lack of trying. She always makes her films interesting in some way. The Ultimate Movie Star !,1364428800,,282,3.8793103448275863
