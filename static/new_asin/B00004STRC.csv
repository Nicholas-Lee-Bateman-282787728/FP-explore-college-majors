7922090,5,B00004STRC,I saw the newer version on TV.  I liked it so well I wanted it for myself.  When I found the double pack I was curious about the original version.  I think both are great and it was well worth the price.,1340323200,2,203,3.7857142857142856
7922091,4,B00004STRC,"Staying mostly true to the original near autobiographical book by Graham Greene, the director of the highly effective ""The Crying Game"", has produced another winner.  The story of the writer Maurice Bendrix's affair with a best friend's wife is woven about the later events of his attempts to establish who his previous lover is now seeing.  The main characters are strongly cast with Ralph Fiennes as Maurice and Julianne Moore as his lover.  Scene setting, pace and photography are exceptional to convey the time about World War II in London.  Preserving the interweaving of the srands from the book, has established a work that is constantly interesting yet still understandable.  Changing one character, presumably to make the plot simpler, has lost one of Greene's messages from the book.  Otherwise the other themes are there, with all the angst that Greene obviously felt in his own life and the real twist that comes at the end.  With the added features of commentary by Julianne Moore and especially by the director, we can appreciate more fully the beauty of the film and the book itself.  This is a great story, filmed beautifully, that will reward repeat viewing. Picture and sound quality are great.",970185600,8,1212,4.9950248756218905
7922092,4,B00004STRC,"This film certainly ranks highly as one of my all time favorite romantic stories.  The pace is precise and builds a story that is quite involving and moving as well.  The recent version is certainly presented in a much more captivating style in terms of cinematography.  If you missed this film in the theatres, this is a must-have.",970012800,7,332,4.689655172413793
