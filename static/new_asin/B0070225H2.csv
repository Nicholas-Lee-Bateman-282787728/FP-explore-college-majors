8507463,3,B0070225H2,"This documentary moves in the manner of a VH1 documentary of a 70s rock band or a cop drama that shuffles rapidly through subplots with a dog's attention span. As one can see from other critical reviews here, this doesn't serve Goodman well, or promote a sympathetic portrait of him.  I think even if the intent (and it obviously was, with a sane rationale) was to provide a warts-and-all image of its subject, the documentary is too scatter-brained for its own good.  Goodman felt frustrated in finding an audience, yet he published books of many sorts, including poetry, fiction, drama, and psychology. His chronically childish (his father abandoned his family when he was quite young, leaving them in near-poverty) and libido-driven need for approval seems to have clouded his ability to appreciate and connect his own accomplishments. Instead, he craved ""connection"" with strangers with whom he made incandescent fantasies of intimacy.  The film seems much more devoted to reflecting the distracted qualities of Goodman's life than in communicating the values and ideals that were most important to him. In any case, this documentary only glances at and gossips about his various accomplishments, in the manner of a casual fan babbling at a bar.  I would have recommended that the directors take four areas of Goodman's work, and his commitments and contradictions, and explore them in some detail.  I would suggest a) his work in the theater and as a playwright [barely mentioned]  b) his work in Gestalt therapy [he co-wrote a foundational text]  c) his conflicts with the new left in the 60s, as an influence and a critic  d) his educational theories.  All of these are reviewed briefly but insubstantially, and, most importantly, with little reference to how Goodman fit into conversations and debates in his own moment, and now.  Goodman's anti-establishment attitudes are so reduced by paraphrase that they sound indistinguishable from the average 19-year-old's asides at Woodstock; this isn't good enough. He was a pacifist, but his ideas, which were rooted, he says in a ""Jeffersonian"" ideal of education, are not be reduced to a trite counter-culturalism or contrarianism. The film thus foregrounds the image of Goodman as a kind of narcissistic twit who seems most remarkable to the film-makers for combining aspects of a Ziggy Stardust character (he was a compulsive cruiser for boys, though married; his widow, still alive, is asked how she felt about Goodman's one-way insistence on sexual liberty: ""Angry"" she says, unsurprisingly) with the sartorial style of a rumpled, tweedy college professor.  How novel! the film suggests, repeatedly.  ""Uh, not really: what was this guy about in detail?"" was my reaction. Too many smart people speak in his behalf (Susan Sontag, e.g., is quoted at length) for me to believe that the superficial, selfish side of Goodman was as definitive of his personality and work as these filmmakers (accidentally?) imply in their scattered and superficial treatment of him.  If one reads Susan Sontag's November 1972 memorial essay about Goodman in the New York Review of Books, something central seems missing from this movie.",1433721600,4,3171,5.181996086105675
8507464,5,B0070225H2,Strange that in my meanderings in American literature and specifically gay politics that I hadn't stumbled onto Paul Goodman. I am planning to use this video in one of my literature classes because it is a mind-expander.,1431475200,2,220,4.972972972972973
8507465,2,B0070225H2,"Full disclosure: I had never heard of Paul Goodman before I watched this documentary. I was attracted to the photogenic portrait on the front cover and the catchy title.

Based on the title I was expecting to learn about the man's philosophy and his revolutionary ideas. I wanted to be convinced that I should read some of his books. I was disappointed... Instead we hear about his over-sized sweaters, baggy pants, and short-lived romances. Why do I care what clothes he wore or who he had sex with? Why do 20 different ""family friends"" need to tell us about his personal life?

The entire DVD is just anecdotes from friends/family spliced with a single interview on ""Firing Line"".

Apparently he was a poet, anarchist, psychologist, pacifist, and openly gay. Beyond those single word descriptions I can't say I learned anything about the man.",1357689600,4,844,4.888111888111888
8507466,4,B0070225H2,"My first encounter with Paul Goodman occurred when I was in my 20s and I was seeing a Gestalt therapist in New York City. He urged me to read Goodman, Perls and Hefferline's ""Gestalt Therapy,"" stating that Goodman was responsible for the theoretical content of the text. ""Gestalt Therapy"" became one of those life-altering books that forever changed how I viewed human psychology. It deepened and furthered my work with my therapist, and now, three decades later, it informs my practice as a social worker. This documentary is a fascinating, thorough, unflinching and excellent biography of an exceedingly complex man. It is very sympathetic towards Goodman, and thus is not exactly a balanced or critical portrayal. Nevertheless, I wish it had been around many years earlier. It has inspired me to read more of Goodman's works, many of which, fortunately, are in print. It is more of an intellectual and political biography of Goodman, a portrait of his public life, but we do learn some details about his personal life as an open homosexual who also happened to be married and a devoted father. The documentary drags at points, and I give it four stars because, while it is a very good film, it is not exactly riveting viewing. One must already have an interest in the subject of the film in order to be captured by it. But captured I was, and I can heartily recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about this central intellectual figure of the 1960s. He was the Noam Chomsky of his age. The segments of Goodman's appearance on William F. Buckley's show were particularly interesting; Goodman was such a challenging figure, I don't think Buckley really knew what to make of him. To see Buckley at a loss for words is quite remarkable!",1349740800,3,1754,4.792079207920792
