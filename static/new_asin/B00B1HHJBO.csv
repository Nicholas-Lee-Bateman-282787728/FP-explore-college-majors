8560827,5,B00B1HHJBO,"Like the other reviewer, I am so happy I found this DVD.  I'm in good shape and the intermediate level kicked my butt. Of course, that inspires me to get to the advanced level. The instruction is very good and doesn't spend a ton of time on set up (a pet peeve of mine.)Michaela is obviously in fantastic shape and has a very cute accent. I couldn't detect music in the background- also something I appreciate. I get tired of hearing the same music over and over. Yes, it does get that little stomach pooch so many of us have trouble with. Having recently experienced lower back pain....ah, isn't aging fun?...... and this has helped enormously. I confidently recommend this DVD for a fast, intense core workout.",1386201600,6,712,4.606299212598425
8560828,5,B00B1HHJBO,"This DVD has three level of workouts for the core: Beginner, Intermediate & Advanced.  Although they are short 10 minute routines, don't let that fool you.  I must say this is the only core workout I have done (& I have done many); it's the only one that has hit my problem area, that little lower pouch that many of us have.  So far I am only doing the beginner routine & will stay with that until I feel it's time to advance.  After I finish, my lower abs feel very warm.  I have never felt that before & can tell it's a good thing.  So, after doing P90X Ab Ripper & many others I feel confident to recommend this DVD.  It seems the roller puts the core in the correct position to work the lower abs, which I can't get from crunching or laying flat.  Although the routine works the entire core & obliques, I focus on the lower abs.  If your new to the roller it may take a couple of times through to feel confident but you'll be glad you did.",1371859200,6,944,4.086956521739131
