6479518,5,B00LCI5XG0,"Junior leaves with his widowed mom and baby brother in a housing project of Caracas .He has a modest dream : to straighten up his curly hair and pose as a singer instead of a revolutionary , for his school-identity card photo . His mom will have none of it . It's not so much the event itself but the symbolism that it carries in her mind that makes her react this way. "" I'll shave your hair "" she threatens him repeatedly and the verbal abuse doesn' t stop here . "" Why are you dancing like that ? "" or "" why are you being so tidy and precious with your food ? its just breakfast "" she asks in different moments in the film , with nervousness and obvious anger in her gaze . The kids mannerisms have created a deep resentment in her for her own son .

I loved this film for various reasons . Firstly , the cinematography is raw and realistic , presenting us images of the daily reality of Venezuela , a country which most viewers have never had the chance to see on the big screen . Furthermore, the casting is exceptional with Castillo being especially fierce . Most inportant of all though , and what hit me the hardest was the main theme : Youths like Junior often experience early in life situations beyond their comprehension . More specifically a feeling of them being unwanted and creating problems and sadness to their families , without doing something to actually justify in any way this backlash . Especially the final act, with Junior shouting at his mother to 'look at him' was devastating to watch . Still , Rondon's film is a rare gem of latin american cinema that deserves all the recognition it can get",1428278400,7,1621,4.314754098360655
8665193,4,B00LCI5XG0,"Movie is in Spanish with English subtitles if you turn it on.  The movie takes place in the slums of Venezuela.  A kid obsessed with straightening his hair because he doesn't like his curls is interested in becoming a singer. Though the kid admires the young man who operates the local newstand, he's never demonstrated any sexual behavior towards the guy, which the mother being paranoid doesn't want the kid to ever see the young man again.  His under-educated single mother mistakens such obsession and admiration to be traits of gay behavior and ask the doctor what to do about it.  The doctor suggests to offer the kid a male figure in the home.  The mother invites her ex-boss over to have sex with him because partly she desperately needs her old security guard job back and his boss requires it for her to get it, and partly to let her son see what a man and a woman is supposed to be like.  As difficult as it is to watch such scenes, these kinds of mindset is a reality in some cases of families where poverty is high.  Overall, the acting is not bad and to see some of the outdoor environment of impoverished neighborhoods is refreshing as it reminds us that such places still exist.  Though this movie is not going to agree with audiences who never lived in such environments, the movie makes some excellent points about the state of mind people can get pushed into because of lack of education and funds.  This family is doing their best to get by day to day as their dinner is nothing more than rice and beans and sugar water.  The kid is not a bad kid, but he has to choose between his own identity (which is not a gay one by the way) and the one his mother forces him into having in order for him to get her love.  You will see his choice at the very end of the story.

The problem I have with this movie is that the subtitle is annoyingly slow as it is delayed by about 3 seconds after the spoken words have long passed.  The text, therefore, never coincides with the physical expressions of the characters.",1509494400,,2024,4.351063829787234

The subtitles are very slow and do not always translate well, as I understand a lot of Spanish so they were not a necessity for me but for someone who is a non Spanish speaker they might miss lines here and there due to the slowness of the subtitles. Overall great watch!",1475107200,,339,4.151515151515151

8665200,4,B00LCI5XG0,It was a great movie. I always love watching international movies. It is more of a coming of age story about a boy who wants to have straight hair. In having straight hair he get's to know his true self. Proverty strucken family. You are introduced to the stuggle and life Junior and his mom have to live.
