3148557,5,B0015XHR66,"This is the story of one of the greatest prehistoric archaeological discoveries ever made in northern Europe. Dr. Michael Parker Pearson has not only uncovered the largest Neolithic settlement ever found in this part of the world, but also what is probably the very KEY to understanding the most unique and enigmatic monument in northern Europe, Stonehenge. His discovery ranks alongside the discovery of Tut's tomb in Egypt, as one of the most important archaeological finds of all time!

That he broke with the commonly held wisdom among archaeologists that excavation OUTSIDE of henges was a waste of time, leading directly to his finds, and then went on to define one of the most convincing reconstructions of archaic rituals ever attempted, shows what a bold thinker he really is. Yes indeed, this is a great story, not only about great science, but also about the very people who are the ancestors to so many of us, about whom so little is known.

I must say I enjoyed watching this documentary immensely! I saw it on TV, but will have my own copy before long. I'd love to watch this at least a few more times. Highly recommended!",1227139200,7,1136,4.761421319796955

3148559,1,B0015XHR66,"I love history, Stonehenge and Donald Sutherland.
Normally I would be in front of the tv and taking it all in but if I hear ""Parker Pearson"" one more time I think I will scream.
The archeologist in this video is NEVER--at least not more than 30 minutes into it--referred to as Dr Pearson, Mr Pearson or just plain Pearson!
Parker Pearson obviously likes the sound of his full name--or at least his first and surnames--and this makes the entire program sound contrived.
Quite frankly 35 minutes into the program I really don't care what Parker Pearson believes.
If you are easily annoyed--STAY AWAY!  If you are not easily annoyed but can be annoyed by pompous self servitude that makes it clear you will never and I mean never mistake Parker Pearson for another archeologist named Pearson--STAY AWAY!!
However, if you enjoy hearing Donald Sutherland say ""Parker Pearson"" 2, 3, 4 times per minute then you will love this program and you are welcome to it!",1212624000,7,954,4.746987951807229

3148568,1,B0015XHR66,"I have never left a program to write a review half way through the show before. I would/could have enjoyed the show, but they have a pop ups almost every fourteen seconds, that destroy the story.  Telling you what hours Stone Henge is open, what deer horn is made of, what chalk is, how many people come to Stone Henge on a summer solstice.  Things you really do not want to know because they barley tie into the narrative. Most of the ""science"" pop ups are things a fairly bright seven year old would know. This approach utterly fractures the story line.  If you enjoy having inane facts thrown at you with bad computer noises this is good television.  Bad to horrible popup/dashboard effects, they assumption everything has to be moving to keep your three seconds attention span. This style of television often times gives me a vicious head ache. If you have an attention span greater than twenty seconds, this is not be for you.  The irony of the bad dash boarding & pop ups ruining the theme of a program about the Stone Age (actually the copper age) is not lost on me.  Shame the actual show could have been good television, but somewhere they decided the Stone Age was best presented in literally three second/visual bites.  What a waste of money, and resources diluting a story that could have easily held your attention.  Glad National Geographic funded this show, I would hate to think what I would say if I was on the board of the organization that was responsible for funding and creating this program.  Good television and story - that went ultra modern bad. Make sure you are working around the house, playing with your cell phone,  watching your young kids, while doing a little extra work from the office, and reading a magazine, because someone who should have known better - thought the story of Stone Henge was not interesting enough to hold your attention for seval seconds in a row.

Much of this video is fantasy, unfortunately, with so-called ""proofs"" often the result of imaginative hopes.

Some of the finds, if original for this team, are remarkable, but the author's ""deductions"" are usually wishful thinking, and not clearly acknowledged as such by Pearson.

3148575,1,B0015XHR66,"They should invent a zero star category for junk like this.  National Geographic has hit an all-time low.  Take a great narrator, Donald Sutherland, a once-reputable magazine, National Geographic, a professor from an accredited university (Sheffield), with a hefty money-bag of funding, and an archaeological enigma like Stonehenge, and what do you get?  Drivel.  Oh, it's true they don't claim aliens made it, or Merlin, though in the end it would have been preferable.  Our on-screen academic, Prof. Parker meets some South American? Shaman who lends him his insight--`Don't you know what this is?'  The Shaman tells Parker.  Light bulbs go off as the amazing Parker has a theory!  Parker then sets out to prove his theory, and guess what?  He does!  He finds exactly what he expects to find--how are we surprised by that?  We are amazed!  We bask in his brilliance!
 You can't do this in real research.  Parker's valid finds of the remains of a Neolithic settlement and another structure, a wooden structure laid out quite similar to Stonehenge (both of which would merit this NG special, if treated correctly)  are completely obscured by the mounds of speculation shoveled upon it as he engages on a feast of imagination to rival when Schliemann tried to make the tiny Troy II into the city of Homer's Iliad.  And bingo!  He's proved his theory.  All of this is worse because in the end there is not just insufficient evidence, but not even one iota of proof of what he proposes.  The video should be renamed, Speculations on some finds near Stonehenge, and then it would be fine, but package theory as truth and it becomes something better scraped off the shoe. The speculations (occasionally prefaced by Sutherland's dreamy voice with the caveat `may') are completely out of nowhere.  The tragedy is that the average viewer who hasn't spent a lifetime in Academia might not recognize the scent of shoddiness of this kind, but I just about lost my lunch.  The film uses re-enactors who mouth some made up language for which they provide SUBTITLES as though the language were real!  Re-enactors are fine for a production like Ken Burns' Civil War, where we know what they wore, who they were, what they spoke, and in many cases exactly where they stood.  Burns' technique deftly brought facts alive.  This special tries to make wild imagination into history.  That's fine for the cinema, but this is supposed to be scholarship!  The outfits though are great.  Not based on anything, but colorful!  I kept expecting Mel Gibson to appear and moon somebody.  Watch for the part where two arrow nicks on a male leg bone lead to proof of HUMAN SACRIFICE at the Temple of the Dead!  A couple of depressions in a floor near a hearth are one moment proof of constant kneeling, and the next moment presto, we're told the building was only occupied for a few days each year.  No attempt is made to reconcile these, yet both are vital for his theory.  This video is the absolute worst kind of academic deception and I can no longer respect anything produced by National Geographic.  Bring back the brain-eating zombie aliens, they were at least funny!",1244160000,16,3144,4.8059701492537314
3148576,1,B0015XHR66,"There is very little that is new in this documentary.  It is simply a vehicle to push Dr Parker Pearson's own theory, of which no real evidence in support is provided.  We are distracted instead with vivid re-enactments, CGI, and a lot of information that is actually ""old news"".  The latter is incorporated in such a way as to imply that Dr Parker Pearson discovered all of it.  People who don't know better could be forgiven for concluding that he discovered Woodhenge, for example.

There are also elements of existing theories which are claimed to be the good Doctor's, when in fact they have been around for a long time (eg that Stonehenge is part of a larger ceremonial complex which also incorporates the nearby Woodhenge).

The only thing that appears to belong to Dr Parker Pearson is the theory that Stonehenge was a temple of the dead.  But alas, the documentary ends as it began: with no conclusive evidence to support this.

He also seems determined to have himself viewed as some kind of maverick visionary, insisting that he ""broke all the rules"" in digging outside the henge walls at Durrington instead of inside.  However, it has long been known that the outside of a bank/ditch can yield finds just as important as those inside (such as the food scraps and rubbish found at the Lake Village near Glastonbury).

Overall, I'm not terribly impressed.  Too much speculation and stuff I already know, but little to support this guy's theory.  Nothing has been decoded, it seems.",1243036800,22,1491,4.78125
3148577,5,B0015XHR66,"This is the best Stonehenge documentary drama I've seen in a while. It hypothesizes about the ritual purposes of Stonehenge temple, the surrounding landscape, and attempts to recreate the conditions of the time period visually with actors while minimizing the new age hype. The author discusses archaeological finds which prove the area around Stonehenge one supported a thriving community, and perhaps the purpose of multiple henges themselves.

There is some focus on the quarrying of the stones, (which seems to be of huge interest) and how the ancients travelled such long distances to make such an intricate monument as well as theories on the purpose of the temple/s.

Overall, I thought this was an excellent documentary with all the latest info on the enigimatic Stonehenge.",1233878400,,782,5.248

This program highlights research being done into the reason the ancients built, and how they may have used, this and other similar structures... as well as the communities that may have grown around these amazing human efforts.",1231459200,10,512,5.071428571428571

The outfits though are great.  Not based on anything, but colorful!  I kept expecting Mel Gibson to appear and moon somebody.  Watch for the part where two arrow nicks on a male leg bone lead to proof of HUMAN SACRIFICE at the Temple of the Dead!  A couple of depressions in a floor near a hearth are one moment proof of constant kneeling, and the next moment presto, we're told the building was only occupied for a few days each year.  No attempt is made to reconcile these, yet both are vital for his theory.  This video is the absolute worst kind of academic deception and I can no longer respect anything produced by National Geographic.  Bring back the brain-eating zombie aliens, they were at least funny!",1244160000,16,3144,4.8059701492537314
3383073,1,B0015XHR66,"There is very little that is new in this documentary.  It is simply a vehicle to push Dr Parker Pearson's own theory, of which no real evidence in support is provided.  We are distracted instead with vivid re-enactments, CGI, and a lot of information that is actually ""old news"".  The latter is incorporated in such a way as to imply that Dr Parker Pearson discovered all of it.  People who don't know better could be forgiven for concluding that he discovered Woodhenge, for example.

There are also elements of existing theories which are claimed to be the good Doctor's, when in fact they have been around for a long time (eg that Stonehenge is part of a larger ceremonial complex which also incorporates the nearby Woodhenge).

The only thing that appears to belong to Dr Parker Pearson is the theory that Stonehenge was a temple of the dead.  But alas, the documentary ends as it began: with no conclusive evidence to support this.

He also seems determined to have himself viewed as some kind of maverick visionary, insisting that he ""broke all the rules"" in digging outside the henge walls at Durrington instead of inside.  However, it has long been known that the outside of a bank/ditch can yield finds just as important as those inside (such as the food scraps and rubbish found at the Lake Village near Glastonbury).

Overall, I'm not terribly impressed.  Too much speculation and stuff I already know, but little to support this guy's theory.  Nothing has been decoded, it seems.",1243036800,22,1491,4.78125
3383074,5,B0015XHR66,"This is the best Stonehenge documentary drama I've seen in a while. It hypothesizes about the ritual purposes of Stonehenge temple, the surrounding landscape, and attempts to recreate the conditions of the time period visually with actors while minimizing the new age hype. The author discusses archaeological finds which prove the area around Stonehenge one supported a thriving community, and perhaps the purpose of multiple henges themselves.

There is some focus on the quarrying of the stones, (which seems to be of huge interest) and how the ancients travelled such long distances to make such an intricate monument as well as theories on the purpose of the temple/s.

Overall, I thought this was an excellent documentary with all the latest info on the enigimatic Stonehenge.",1233878400,,782,5.248
3383075,4,B0015XHR66,"Some folks may have an interest in topics like Stonhenge based on ""mystical"" attractions.  Don't go here if that's your thing.  National Geographic still gets my support for their scientific approach to such topics rather than taking the easy route, i.e. ""x files"" ear and eye candy.  This program highlights research being done into the reason the ancients built, and how they may have used, this and other similar structures... as well as the communities that may have grown around these amazing human efforts.",1231459200,10,512,5.071428571428571

8260392,5,B0015XHR66,I researched Stonehenge in the early 70's for a class in primitive history and literature.  We knew nothing of the surrounding finds back then.  This was SO fascinating.

8260395,5,B0015XHR66,"I am sitting here reading these reviews and I am wondering if these people watched the same film that I did.  This is the first place I ever saw these theories about stonehenge and darlington walls being linked in some other way than prototype and finished product.  His discovery of this massive paleolithic city is an impressive feet not to mention the Boulevard between the two henges.  But as one the reviewer's stated there's no proof that his theory could be correct.  The video shows the theory of how the rock was moved and what distances they believe they where brought.  This is ground breaking information on an iconic monument of human enginuity, but no there's nothing of any importance in the film.  As for being not very well known, prior to the discovery of Tut's tomb no one knew the name Howard Carter but now it is a name synonymous with Egyptology.  Much like art, archeology has a hard time accepting that some theories that have been accepted for a long time are more important than really knowing the truth.  Watch it, it is well worth your time form your own opinions and don't let someone else's skeptical nature dictate your desire to learn.
