690077,2,6303619932,"Mary Ingals, her kids, and sister gets nabbed by the Shawnee. Eventually she finds her way out of the village and embarks on a long wilderness journey back home.
I've got some problems with this movie. It basically treats the Indians as brutish savages, complete with a broken-hearted Shawnee Indian brave who swipes Mary's kids in a fit of jealous rage. I was almost expecting the producers to wheel out a piece of Samsonite luggage for him to swing around and smash. Not to say that the Brave isn't attractive and interesting to Mary. She's attracted to him, but only in the HOT HOT HOT outdoorsy style sex kind of way.
Mary is attracted to the Brave and entertains thoughts of steamy love with him. She snaps out of his spell when the Brave suggests marriage To her credit, he was coming on too strong, I don't know of many women who would marry a guy on the first date. This is 17th century Virginia and not Reno or Las Vegas.
It's no big surprise when she chooses to stay faithful to her hubby. Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, her simpish husband is out looking for her with some dude in a powdered wig. This Indian guy is actually wanting to adopt her kids, at the same time Hubby is wandering around in the woods with some guy in a wig. The choice should be obvious sister.
Instead she doesn't listen to reason and rebukes the Brave's offer of marriage, he gets steamed (suitcase smashing ensues) and he sells her to a tubby Frenchman with really greasy hair. Disgusted by the prospect of having sex with Frenchy McSweatsausage she decides to make her way back to her husband.
Blah, blah, blah. I won't spoil the ending of this one, let's just say it seemed a little...strange.",1041120000,11,1687,4.516339869281046
690078,4,6303619932,"The only thing that made me want to watch this movie, was the fact that Renee O'Connor was in it. So, when it came on the Hallmark channel a few weeks ago, I did. The best parts had Renee, she brought so much to the movie. But when her character was removed from the last third of the movie, I almost became disinterested. The survival thing was OK, but I still think Renee would have made a much better Mary Ingles.",1032480000,2,416,4.148148148148148
690079,4,6303619932,"Although it does stir up memories of being forced to watch Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman & flicks like The Last of the Mochicans, this true story turned out to be just a good old fashion tale of survival and ultimate triumpth. I purchased this movie solely to see my favorite actress Renee O'Connor (""Gabrielle"" from the TV show Xena: Warrior Princess) play the wounded shaky sister of pregnant, focused and utterly BRAVE Mary Ingles, both women victims of an new America Indian raid, forced to travel some 800 miles uphill with their devoted male counterparts searching for them not far behind. Eric Schweig plays a toned & interesting Indian who pursues and admires the strong minded Mary Ingles; Renee O'Connor shines as her younger and not so certain sister, Betty, who, in my opinion, totally MAKES this movie by bringing her usual unsurpassed charmisa and emotional charm to tie in any loose ends.
My only complaints: the 800 mile travel was sort of uneventful and slow and some of the survival tactics they used were like ""yeah right...""",1025136000,22,1039,4.842696629213483
690080,5,6303619932,I loved reading this book and I thought that it was a great idea to turn it into a movie so people can actually see what really happened and can also believe it.,1024790400,,161,3.909090909090909
690081,5,6303619932,I saw this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have also read the book which I could not put down.  Even though the movie did not follow the book as closely as it could have it was still worth watching just to see hottie Eric Schweig!!  This movie (and book) are even more impacting if you have been to the New River Gorge and have seen what she traveled through.  I highly recommend that everyone see this enchanting true story of Mary Ingles' plight as she returned home.,992995200,,473,4.340909090909091
690082,2,6303619932,"A Hallmark Hall of Fame production, this made for TV movie has about as much true emotion as a typical Hallmark card.
The Indians are not frightening.  The women, after being prisoners on the trail for days, look  like they had just stepped from the shower in fresh clothes.  They mostly  happily smile at each other, except during the requisite Emotional  Outbursts and Tellings Off.  The escape lacks even a modicum of tension.  The whole film drips Sincerity.
Eric Schweig, a good actor, is  wasted.
The best that this film has going for it is that it is  inoffensive.  Just like a Hallmark card.
Maybe the book will be better.",962064000,13,630,4.6454545454545455
690083,4,6303619932,Mary Ingles had great courage to survie in the situation that she was in. This movie shows how she used her talents for her survival instead of fighting against the indians and when the opertunity was right she escaped.

690084,3,6303619932,"This is a great survival flick - and it really happened!  Sheryl Lee is excellent as the proud, tenatious pregnant survivor of an Indian raid.  Eric Schweig provides more than enough screen  chemistry as her also proud,  interested Indian suitor. If you liked Last of the Mohecans,  see this true  story.",956275200,39,304,4.862745098039215

690210,3,6303619932,This is a great movie. The price now has gone way up. This movie used to be only $5 and now it is almost $40. I would say it is worth 5 but not 40. This is more accurate then other movies. Still not completely accurate. Overall there is a great storyline of survival.,1489276800,,267,3.962962962962963

690213,3,6303619932,"After reading the book this movie was hard to watch. They left out many important details and totally changed the ending to give it a 'happily ever after' ending. If you plan on reading the book I would recommend watching the movie FIRST, because if you watch it after you will be disappointed! The acting was good, and the scenery was nice but the story lacked so much of what the book was about that you couldn't get a true feel of the struggles, hardships and starvation that these two women endured. Their story is amazing and this movie didn't do it justice!",1484697600,3,563,4.475728155339806

Of course a movie can't include nearly every interesting happening that a book can, but this movie did a particularly poor job of selecting the most interesting and meaningful parts of Mary's trek back home.

690377,1,6303619932,"The book is one of my favorites and when I found out a movie had been made based upon the book, I was delighted and couldn't wait to see it. but I was greatly and sadly disappointed. There was so little about the actual journey home that it almost seemed an afterthought. And the ending was horrible beyond words. It was a lie and, even for Hallmark, it hit a new low in sappiness. I can't imagine why in the world the author gave permission for them to abuse his book in such a devastating fashion.  This story deserves so much more than a silly Hallmark movie. I am waiting with hope for the time when it will be portrayed in realistic and faithful way.  Don't waste your money on this movie.  Wait with me for a portrayal that will  do it justice.  In the meantime, read the book. .",1457740800,2,785,4.206666666666667

Mary Ingles endured much; this movie belittles her courage and perseverance.
The ending of the movie is very unreal.
The book goes on and on over too much detail of the terrain; the movie is too nice and does not portray the violence of the capture and the difficulties of getting back home.",1452124800,,356,4.578125

Of course the film had v to be the condensed version, but still very good, about a pioneer woman, Mary Ingles, who was captured by the Shawnee tribe. The story is of her ordeal, and eventual escaoe, following the Ohio river, back to her homestead. I enjoyed the film almost as much as I did the book. I suggest reading the book first.

I understand the lack of action and real violence in the beginning massacre - you would not want the movie to depict what is described in the book.  I was disappointed that the group were walking instead of riding horses, as in the movie.  Most of the scenes (until the end, and I won't mention that again) followed the book quite well; however, as one other reviewer mentioned, the scenes were to short and choppy.

Read the book; it is the type of book you do not want to put down.

p.s. Adam Harman, who found Mary at the end and nursed her back to health was my 5th great grandfather.",1440979200,2,696,4.2748091603053435

It is a picture of what it must have been like for the settlers and indians way back when.  The characters did a good job.  I recognized the old chief who also was in ""The Last of the Mohicans"".  Ellen Burstyn did an amazing job as well.  All in all a really good movie that the whole family would enjoy.  There was violence in the beginning, but nothing graphic at all.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in that time period and how hard it was to make a living, have children, and the hostilities with the indians (also the hardships the indians endured).  Once again it is a ""B"" movie, but worth watching.",1438992000,4,783,4.26530612244898

The main  fault I find with the movie is that I don't believe that a woman would leave her two children and a young relative behind while she escaped to go back to her husband.  I believe that most women would have stayed there and made some sort of life in order to be with her children.  I find it difficult to believe that the Indian would have risked his own life to return her children to her.  This may have all happened.  I haven't read the book.  It just seems improbable to me.

By the end of her 6-week trip she was emaciated, naked, and exhausted. The film has a fully clothed star rescued by hillbillies--who were in fact German immigrants who spoke heavily accented English. The film has them take her to a cozy cabin with a plump feather bed and curtains at the window. Actually it was the men's hunting camp where they grew some corn and pastured a few cows and horses. The men did gently wash and clothe her and place her on their floor pallet to recuperate. Worst of all, at the end the kind Indians returned Mary's sons, one of whom actually had died. The other remained with Indians for many more years. The old German woman is more accurately portrayed, though also fully clothed. The supposed love story between Mary and the Indian is from the highly-fictionalized novel on which the film is based. The real story is too brutal for Hallmark.",1373068800,2,1023,4.688888888888889

691217,4,6303619932,"This was an interesting film to watch. Captive stories can be strangely one sided in the telling, certainly many of the sensational book and magazine captive stories in history were sensationalizing the events of the real people to capture an audience. This tries to honour everyone involved. I think it does succeed in most of it's goals, it certainly shows how complex the times were with people attacking each other for food and survival needs ... and then also trading with each other more often than not, out of close proximity, natural surroundings and precious few commodities to share. This film shows the settlers nerves were stretched, probably from their having to leave their own countries under duress, under attack, and under minded by the governing ruling class of the day in their own countries. They arrive in new surroundings to be governed by the same elite colonial governments, that they hoped to escape in leaving their countries of birth. Everyone is challenged to overcome their prejudices and nervous suspicion of anyone who is not of the same cultural background as themselves - be it Irish or English or German or French immigrants all responding differently to meeting and interacting with the first peoples indigenously native of turtle island, the Americas. A complex story that the filmmakers obviously decided needed to be told in this way, under these circumstances of captive and settler life cycles. Better than most captive stories I have researched and read in it's attempt to round out to include a larger portrait of all the humans struggling to try to understand what/why the heck they were all suddenly historically thrust together ... to form a new community ... to heal ... to want to create, or not want to create common unity.

Isn't that almost always the case?  That having been stated, I think the movie stands alone quite well.  After all, this is a Hallmark film; they're not going to show a baby being tossed in the air and hit with a tomahawk, and frankly, I'm glad they didn't. It might not have been true to the original story, but it was much more appropriate to watch with my grandchildren.

The cast was excellent and the scenery gorgeous.  Sheryl Lee was perfect.  She portrayed a strong, loving, independent woman who possessed humor and drive; exactly the type of person who could endure what Mary Ingles did.  Ellen Burstyn is always good.  Eric Schweig was very believable and charismatic.

The fact that on their journey home they only had one blanket, were starving, exhausted and practically losing their minds was quite apparent.  I don't think that it was necessary, or possible, to show the total misery in the detail a book would, (we don't need to see them naked and lose 30 pounds to understand their plight) nor do I think that one should expect that a Hallmark film would even attempt to do so.

691397,2,6303619932,"I watched this not really knowing what to expect.  In the end, I was disappointed more on account of the improbability of the plot than anything else.  Many movies are set in the colonial American frontier, this is almost a film genre unto itself, but most tend to deliver entertainment much more than this movie did.  Beginning way back with ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" and continuing to the more recent version of ""Last of the Mohicans,"" frontier-based movies show warring natives bent on killing and/or capturing white settlers.

While these kindsof raids obviously took place, the dramatizations Hollywood produces are generally cut from the same mold.  ""Follow the River"" is no exception to the theme, but it fails to deliver any meaningful message and even fails to develop believable characters in plausible settings.  The heroine, Mary Ingalls, is captured by raiding Shawnees, gives birth along the trail, sees her companions, friends, and her own son sold off to another tribe, gives her infant daughter to her captors, then escapes with some French woman who was captured prior to Mary and company.

The route back to civilization follows the course of a river that seems to be nothing more than boiling rapids and small waterfalls.  The scenery is the best part of the whol;e movie.  Though a search party is assembled to find the captives, this part of the storyline is quite weak and really serves no purpose to the overall production.

Miraculously (or rather per the script) Mary makes it back to near where her original cabin was located.  Shortly thereafter her French companion arrives, then her husband (who supposedly was looking for her).  At the end, her Indian captor returns with both her son and infant daughter so the family is happily reunited.  Nothing is said of her other fellow captives, I suppose it was even too much of a stretch for the director to have these folks show up in the end as well.

The casting in this movie was weak.  The characters do not grow at all in either wisdom or believability.  The script was weak and the storyline unoriginal.  I could probably list mre faults, but it really wouldn't add more to my point that this film was a waste of time to sit through.",1256428800,2,2213,4.796833773087071

691402,1,6303619932,"When looking at this movie as a stand-alone film it fails miserably.  First off, its boring.  There are two incidences of violence, both in the second scene, and one is actually not shownn (we hear the sound a man's voice get cut short by the sound of an arrow) so there is zero action in this film.  Each scene is about two minutes long, so the movie is choppy.  Basically two women, a man and a child are kidnapped by American Indians.  They walk for two days to an Indian village, and Mary Ingles has an easy, perfect birth along the way.

Once there they meet an ""old"" woman.  The old woman and the man have to run down a line of Indians who slap them with narrow strips of leather on sticks...oh owwie make it stop...(please note the sarcasm).  It gives no explaination for this (remember I am viewing the movie as a stand-alone, not in reference to the book), so the whole exercise is superfluous.  Then the family is seperated and divided among the Indians and French traders at the village.

A day or so later Mary abandons her family and runs off with the old woman to get back home to Mary's husband.  After two or three days arduous journey where they whine non-stop about being hungry and fall into a one-foot deep river, they arrive home exhausted.  And then someone in the make-up department put some leaves in Ellen Burstyn's hair.

Then the warrior that kidnapped them and divided Mary's family up came walking back into their front yard the next day with the two stolen children because of Mary's bravery (because she took 3 days to get back home).

This movie was weak, boring, and disjointed.  They seemed to be afraid to offend Indians so they made them thieves with honor instead of the murdering thieves they were in the book.  The most critical and important aspects of the ""true"" story were either ignored or glossed-over (the complete true story is unknown, the 2 books are based on handed-down tales from her descendants).  I don't think this would even make it to the Hallmark channel, although Lifetime Movies is a possibility since they show Jackie Collins movies afterall.

When you compare this movie to the book of the same name, it drops to a zero-star review.  The whole point of this story is that Mary and Gretel walked back home over a thousand miles of rough country without preperations and basically no provisions.  They were bloody, bruised, starving and mentally ill when they arrived at their destination.  Here are the important parts the movie misses:

When the Indians attacked the English settlement, they stole Bettie Draper's baby and played toss with it.  One of the Indians smacked it out the air with his tomahawk then killed the baby by grabbing it by the ankle and smacking its head against the cabin.  This is why Bettie held such a burning hatred for the Indians.  But the baby didn't even appear in the film, so the source for Bettie's hatred is a simple gunshot wound.  Good thing the director never bothered to play up that hatred, another missed opportunity.

Mary's mother was scalped at the English settlement and left for dead while she was protecting Mary's two sons.  In the movie Mary has but one son (a fine Irish blonde??? son), and her mother did indeed die (off-camera) but from a broken heart from being scalped.  So the Indians killed or kidnapped everyone from the settlement except her mother?  Sounds hokey to me too.

After leaving the settlement they were placed on horse for the walk to the Indian village.  But after a big hunting expedition everyone but the pregnant Mary was forced to walk, giving Bettie reason to hate Mary.  Then Mary had her baby along the trail and would bleed for several days after.  Finally the bleeding stopped and she chose to walk to.  All-in-all it took a full month to walk to the village.

After their arrival in Shawnee town, they met the other captives including the aforementioned old woman.  The men were stripped naked then forced to run the gauntlet.  Except they Indians used sticks and whipped the runners as hard as possible and beat them unconcious if they fell down.  Then the old woman and Bettie Draper were forced to run it naked.  They too were beaten mercilessly.  Again the movie missed out on this opportunity, the damage inflicted in the movies was a handfull of welts that could be calmed by blowing on them.

I'm not about to list everything here because the mistakes are far too many (or perhaps too few because the movie skipped so much of the events).  The most important problem of the ""adaptation"" is the journey home.  As I mentioned above it felt like two or three days long.  In fact they walked for about three months straight, with almost no food, no winter clothing (no clothing at all by the time they got home, including their shoes), two blankets and one tomahawk.  Along the way they starved, fought off wolves, fought off each other, and lost the tomahawk and one of the blankets.  Near the end of the trip the old woman even attacked Mary in an attempt to eat her.

None of this was even addressed in the movie.  The closest they came was as one point you realize they are down to the one blanket, but not even a mention along the way that the other one was lost (pretty important to me when walking through the mountains during the early winter).  Mary arrived home with the tomahawk, weighing the same as when she left the Englished settlement, with her hair, dress and shoes just a little dirty.

This movie is a total failure to tell even a part of the story of Mary Ingles.  This movie should have been less ""Little House on the Prairie"" and more ""Last of the Mohicans.""  The only possible redeeming quality in this movie is Sheryl Lee's eyes.

691499,2,6303619932,"The novel, ""Follow the River"", was based on a true story, and this film is based on that novel.

I read the true story in the book:
""Shawnee Captive: The Story of Mary Draper Ingles"" or
""The Long Journey Home: The true story of Mary Draper Ingles""
(Available elsewhere for less money than here).

This film changed the truth just enough to ruin an interesting, true, story. The film is scenic and holds your attention. The men in the story are hapless and helpless.

How many women, in their ninth month of pregnancy, could hike through the forest all day, for days, on short food rations, stop to give birth while leaning against a tree, then immediately start hiking again all day, carrying their baby? A woman wrote the script! Might women benefit from walking all day during pregnancy and right up to giving birth? Is lying in bed really the best way to give birth? Should husbands buy the DVD and book for their complaining pregnant wives? Or was this mindless script-writing? If you click on the comment-button, below, I tell whether such events are true or not.

We are also left wondering whether the very end is true or not.

This film would have been much better, if it had stayed with the key points of truth. You can add things to a true story that do not change the key points of truth. You can add new characters to give more personality whose actions do not effect the key points of truth. You can leave out the uninteresting. You can fill in the gaps and imagine things with historical accuracy without changing the key points of truth. The film, ""The Ten Commandments"" is a good example; it fills in the gaps of the Biblical story well, and imagines pharaoh's palace, without changing the key points of truth of the Bible's story.

All would have enjoyed more details on how they lived at the time. It is mystifying, that the film's woman writer presented Mary as less smart, than Mary was in the true story. The film portrays Mary not planning and not stocking food for the escape.

If you hit the comment button below, you will see truth separated from fiction in this film, and see the story's true ending. You will see the film changed key points of truth that they should not have changed, which made the film into fiction and impossible as presented (the women taking turns with one blanket in winter). The film also left out the interesting truth. Doing the extra work to find out the truth would have made a much better film.

This film should be re-made, sticking to the truth, under the title of the true story.",1176854400,24,2538,4.526200873362446

691504,2,6303619932,"This politically-correct slaughter of a true story portrays Indian captors (supposedly the bad guys) as the more likeable characters; while on the other hand, I had a hard time sympathizing with the charmless protagonist--a white woman who all too readily gives up her child in order to go to a husband who seems hardly worth the effort. Life among the Indians isn't bad (once she gets past the gauntlet), and she meets kind new friends. Eric Schweig plays the Indian who wants to marry her. His natural strength and charisma as an actor bring his character across as far the better man than the husband to whom the heroine is fleeing, which leaves the viewer wondering what she's thinking. Following the escape, the walk home is short enough to make you suspect that Hubby might have found her if he'd really been looking. Worse, the journey seems less about triumph over hardship than about hard-to-like women revealing weak characters under stress. All in all, the movie fails completely, and Schweig's performance stands as the only reason to suffer through to the poignant (but untrue) ending. As history it's worthless, as drama it's confusing in places and gruelling in others. But all that aside, it's an important collectible for Eric Schweig fans.",1111795200,8,1257,4.962085308056872
