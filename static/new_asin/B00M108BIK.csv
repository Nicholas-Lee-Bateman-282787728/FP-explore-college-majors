8669563,2,B00M108BIK,I ordered this movie because it claimed ultra hd quality. I was disappointed with the actual quality of the film. I payed extra for the UHD for a reason. Don't waste your money...,1450828800,,179,4.454545454545454
8669564,5,B00M108BIK,"I have been wanting a DVD like this for years!  You have the option to watch the exhibits with or without narration, art for your TV, and bonus features.  The bonus features are loops of the specific exhibits without narration.  I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium so much, but it is a 2 day car trip to get there for us.  Of course nothing is as good as actually being in Monterey in person, but this DVD eases the pain :)  I almost feel like I'm actually at the aquarium.  The picture quality is much better than what you get on the aquarium's webcams.  I wish I could give this DVD 50 stars!  I love it!  I love it!  I love it!",1431388800,7,627,4.065573770491803
