8541286,5,B009GJBHM6,"I recently purchased Power & Endurance Spain and this is my favorite out of the other global rides which are very good.  I started off with the France set, then moved to Hawaii set and used these for my winter in door workout for about a year, then I purchased this DVD because of the 30, 60 and 90 minute workout options, the 90 minutes is fantastic.  The only regret I have is not buying the Spain series, wish I could exchange this DVD and buy the Spain set.",1394582400,,461,4.168539325842697
8541287,5,B009GJBHM6,"As an owner of many of the superb cycling videos from Global Rides, I was not surprised by the excellence contained on the ""Power & Endurance in Spain"" DVD! This video contains the great feature of allowing the rider or cycling trainer to select a 30, 60, or 90 minute training ride.  Beyond that great feature, the many options for audio and the quality of the virtual ride experience makes this video a must have for one's cycling training library.  I commend Global Rides for upping their game with this DVD:  it is excellent.  Because of the quality and enjoyment I experienced I have ordered the remaining 2 videos in this series.  The bottom line for me is that this DVD from Global Rides provides a tremendous virtual training experience for those of us stuck on our trainers during the winter weather in the Northeast.  Great DVD!",1363737600,,838,4.666666666666667
8541288,5,B009GJBHM6,"The Global Ride Spain series is amazing. This DVD in particular, Power and Endurance, is one of the best the company has produced. That's saying a lot. The on the road coaching addition is spectacular. Also, it has a 60 minute and 90 minute option, which is a spectacular added bonus. The hills are demanding, the scenery is incredible, and the overall workout is superb. Global Ride just keeps getting better. I can't wait to see what they do next.",1358035200,,449,4.625
8541289,5,B009GJBHM6,"Just a quick note - I got the DVD the other day and tried it straight away. I am impressed. You guys just keep getting better and better.

The quality of the video was fantastic (as was the scenery) - much more stable than ever before and nice to watch. And I really enjoyed the on-the-bike coaching - really adds a lot of realism to the whole experience.
Overall - I think it is the best yet.",1350518400,,393,4.103896103896104
