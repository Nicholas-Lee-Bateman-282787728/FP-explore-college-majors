6987722,5,B00SIHM7PI,"Five Frank Sinatra musicals in a five Blu-Ray package at a nice price.
Three are from his prime Hollywood years (1945-1955).
Two are from the Rat Pack period (1960s).

The five movies have already been released as individual Blu-Rays.
This new box has a price advantage: five Blu-Rays for the price of three.
All five Blu-Rays fit into a plastic case.
You also get a hardcover picture book (no print content).
Everything slides into a rigid slipcase (one inch thick).
Beautiful Blu-Ray picture quality.
The first two films are in the 4:3 picture ratio, which was standard for the 1940s.
The final three are widescreen.
All have subtitles in English.

1) ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) is actually a Gene Kelly musical.
Sinatra plays his sidekick.
The film's highlight is Gene Kelly dancing with a cartoon mouse.
Quite impressive really.
There is some breathtaking technicolor photography of the Hollywood Bowl back in 1945 (track 30).
About half the score is classical music performed by Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi, but
Frank Sinatra gets to sing Brahms' Lullaby (track 10)
and Tchaikovsky's ""Tonight We Love"" (track 26 - actually the First Piano Concerto adapted to a popular song).
Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are the only composers credited.
None of the classical composers are identified - I have tried to correct this in a footnote. *
Extras:
- Animators Hanna and Barbera discuss mixing live action with animation (2 minutes).
- Theatrical trailer.
- Pete Smith Specialty ""Football Thrills of 1944""
- MGM cartoon ""Jerky Turkey"" directed by Tex Avery
(the last two have nothing to do with the movie, but were released by MGM in the same year as ""Anchors Aweigh"").

2) ""On the Town"" (1949) also with Gene Kelly - this time the two are equals.
Based on the Leonard Bernstein Broadway hit.
Unfortunately only four numbers by Bernstein were used, supplemented by some lesser music. Great film nonetheless.
Extras:
- Theatrical trailer.
- John Nesbitt's Passing Parade: ""Mr. Whitney Had a Notion"" - a documentary about the inventor of mass production (really).
- MGM cartoon "" Doggone Tired"" directed by Tex Avery
(the last two have nothing to do with the movie, but were released by MGM  in the same year as ""On the Town"").

3) ""Guys and Dolls"" (1955) Sinatra is finally the Star.
Marlon Brando receives equal billing, and is quite good, but his singing voice is only adequate which is clearly a handicap in a musical.
A fairly faithful adaptation of the Frank Loesser Broadway musical (good).
Great dancing by the supporting cast.
This is the first movie in the package to be filmed in wide-screen, and receives the deluxe treatment on Blu-Ray.
Extras:
- An hour's worth of documentaries about the making of the film.
- Isolated tracks of just the musical numbers (another good idea),
- Theatrical trailer.

4) ""Oceans Eleven"" (1960) is the ultimate Rat Pack movie.
Not really a musical, but Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Junior sing some songs in character.
Surprisingly, Frank Sinatra sings nothing.
The greatest Las Vegas Movie ever made (just ahead of ""Viva Las Vegas"").
Rat Pack associate members Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop, Norman Fell (yes), Angie Dickinson, and Shirley MacLaine are also present -  they don't get to sing either.
""Oceans Eleven"" is also the coolest movie ever made:
I was shocked to see that it was directed by Hollywood legend Lewis Milestone - He began his directing career in 1918.
Lewis Milestone won the Academy Award as Best Director for ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" in 1929.
Hard to picture him hanging out at the Sahara with Frank, Dean and Sammy.
Extras:
- Commentary track by Frank Sinatra Junior and Angie Dickinson.
- Documentary about Las Vegas in the 1960s (6 minutes).
- A map of the Las Vegas Strip showing the five casinos that were robbed in the movie.
Use the up and down arrows to view brief documentaries about each casino, hosted by cocktail waitresses who worked at these casinos back in the Sixties (and are mostly well-preserved).
- Tonight Show excerpt with Sinatra and Angie Dickinson
- Theatrical trailers.

5) ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"" (1964): Somewhat of a disappointment after ""Oceans Eleven"".
Only the three principal Rat Packers are involved and everyone is trying too hard to be cool.
One saving grace - Bing Crosby in one of his last musical appearances (he was young Frank Sinatra's hero).
Also one of Sinatra's last hit songs, ""My Kind of Town (Chicago is)"" was from this movie.
Extras:
- Commentary track by Frank Sinatra Junior (he was kidnapped during the filming).
- Vintage MGM featurette about the making of the film (ignores Frank Junior's kidnapping).
- Theatrical trailer.
- Warner cartoons ""Robin Hood Makes Good"" (1939), ""Rabbit Hood"" (Bugs Bunny, 1949), and ""Robbin Hood Daffy' (Daffy Duck, 1958). The latter two directed by Chuck Jones.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

My only complaint is that ""On the Town"" is a great enough film to deserve the deluxe treatment:
A documentary similar to that accompanying ""Guys and Dolls"" would be welcome.
Maybe a commentary track.
Maybe packaged in a hardcover digibook.
I like digibooks.
(the single Blu-Ray release of ""Guys and Dolls"" is in digibook format:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guys-and-Dolls-Blu-ray/dp/B008OBNE8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guys and Dolls [Blu-ray</a>] )
Oh, well.

6987725,4,B00SIHM7PI,"This is for Amazon. Thank you for the delivery,right on time from the US to Denmark, the tracking system is just so nice.
The Frank Sinatra collection is great, 636 mins and 5 movies in total. Looking forward to see ""Guys and Dolls"",
""Ocean`s 11"" and ""Robin and the 7 hoods"", because these three are all new to me. As for, ""On the town"" and ""Anchors aweigh"", both aspect ratios are 4:3 and well, they look super! The three others are about 21:9. Also in good condition.
The colors are beautiful and the upgrade from dvd to blu ray is awesome. I've got a JVC projector HD-750 and it looks so awesome on it. The sound is also fine. These movies are from 1945-64, so don't expect hi-tech sound. There is a little booklet with pictures, without text, I like these things. One star taken from the box because of the lack of extras though. There is a small amount (audio commentaries,vintage featurettes,trailers and vintage cartoons), but it's just not quite enough. Overall the package is excellent though, really worth my purchase.",1430956800,3,1028,4.653846153846154
6987726,5,B00SIHM7PI,"Frank Sinatra: Five Film Collection assembles Sinatra-starring films from three different decades. Though all five pictures have been released before, they are together in this 5-disc collection. The titles are Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, ""Guys and Dolls,"" Robin and the 7 Hoods, and Oceans 11.""

Anchors Aweigh (1945) co-stars Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson. Sinatra solos on What Makes the Sunset and I Fall in Love Too Easily, and duets with Kelly in a terrific song and dance routine, I Begged Her. A highlight of the movie is Kellys The Worry Song sequence featuring Jerry the Mouse and a host of animated characters.

On the Town (1949), the story of three sailors on 24-leave, is notable for its on-location filming in New York City at a time when most films were shot in studios or back lots. The opening New York, New York is outstanding. If you look closely, toward the end of the number, you can see background crowds watching the filming in Rockefeller Center. Once again, Gene Kelly co-stars. The cast includes Jules Munshin, Ann Miller, Vera-Ellen, and Betty Garrett. A highlight is Sinatras duet with Garrett, Come Up to My Place, in which Garretts cab driver tries to get romantic with Sinatra, who reads from a decades-old guide book listing no-longer existing attractions.

Guys and Dolls (1955) stars Sinatra as Nathan Detroit in the film adaptation of the Broadway hit. When Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) is challenged to take a missionary (Jean Simmons) to Havana, he finds himself falling in love. The Frank Loesser score is rich and includes Luck Be a Lady, which Sinatra would sing later in concert appearances, Sit Down Youre Riocking the Boat, Fugue for Tinhorns, Sue Me, and the title song. Vivian Blaine stars as Adelaide, Nathans long-suffering girlfriend.

Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964) features Sinatra and fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. The movie takes place in Prohibition-era Chicago. Sinatra is Robbo, who controls the north side of the city and bucks the corruption of racketeer Guy Gisborne. Sinatra sings My Kind of Town, an homage to the Windy City, and joins Bing Crosby and Martin on Style. A flamboyant solo by Davis  Bang! Bang!  is a showstopper.

Oceans 11 (1960), the only non-musical in the set, is a caper film. Eleven friends who know each other from World War II service plan to rob five of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, Angie Dickinson, Richard Conte, Cesar Romero, and Joey Bishop co-star with Sinatra.

Blu-ray bonus extras include Hanna & Barbera discussing the making of The Worry Song; several MGM short subjects; vintage cartoons; Las Vegas Then and Now vignettes; theatrical trailers; and commentary by Frank Sinatra, Jr.",1430784000,2,2755,4.960954446854664

For family movie night, the best bet in the Frank Sinatra 5-Film Collection is Robin and the 7 Hoodsa 1964 prohibition musical-comedy set in Chicago that offers an amusing gangster version of the Robin Hood legend. That film and others in this collection new to Blu-ray are available as single titles as well. Whether the five-film collection is worth buying will depend on how much your family likes old musicals (four out of five films are musicals) and how tolerant the kids are of older films. But at least all five are in color, and all are the equivalent of PG-rated films. The discs seem to be identical to the single releases, with the same bonus features, but with a handsome hardcover book of color and black-and-white photos from the five films and the discs on separate plastic pages in an oversized Blu-ray case, all tucked inside a sturdy cardboard slipcase. Picture quality is terrific for all five films, though the Mono DTS on four of them may not be what viewers are used to. But if your family loves musicalsold ones includedthis is a great collection.

Robin7HoodsscreenRobin and the 7 Hoods (1964, 123 min., 2.40:1 widescreen, trailer)This clever and funny riff on the Robin Hood legend stars Peter Falk (TVs Columbo) in a hilarious role as Guy Gisbourne (in the movies, it was Sir Guy of Gisbourne), who bumps off Big Jim and takes control of the city racketeering, with the Sheriff offering protection for a fee. Naturally Robbo (Sinatra) objects, and their rival factions square off in a battle for speakeasy supremacy. Bing Crosby stars as the troubadour Allen A. Dale, with Dean Martin playing John Little (instead of Little John), and Sammy Davis Jr. as Will Scarlet. But the Robin Hood legend really kicks in when Big Jims daughter, Marian (Barbara Rush), thinks the Sheriff responsible for her fathers death and Robbo responsible for his disappearance. She gives Robbo a $50,000 payoff. Get rid of it, Robbo says, and his merry men donate the whole bunch to an orphanage. Other charities follow, and its fun to watch this legend play itself out on Chicago gangsterland turf. Theres bootlegging and flappers in skimpy costumes but no sex, no language to speak of, and no onscreen violence. Great songs, clever plot, and funny moments. My teenage son gave it an A, he liked it so much. Id say its more of an A-.

GuysandDollsscreenGuys and Dolls (1955, 150 min., 2.55:1 widescreen, trailer)The second best title in this collection is the film adaptation of the Broadway hit that itself was based on a Damon Runyon story about Broadway gamblers. Nathan Detroit (Sinatra) runs a floating crap game and has been dating dancer Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) for more than a decade. Hes fond of her but unable to commit to marriage because hes just as fond of gambling and his gambling pals, which include his second, Nicely-Nicely Johnson (comic actor Stubby Kaye). There are plenty of Broadway denizens in need of saving, and Jean Simmons plays Sarah Brown, who is in charge of the local Salvation Army. The action is set in motion when Lt. Brannigan (Robert Keith) puts the heat on and the only place that will host Nathans illegal gambling operation for one night wants $1000. How to get it? With famous better Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) in town, Nathan tries to get him to bet on a sure thing for him. When Sky brags that he can convince any woman to go with him to Havana for the night Nathan looks out the window and points out Sarah Brown. I choose her, he says, and the bet is on. The song-and-dance numbers are old-school musical and the dialogue is Runyonesque, but after a while you get used to it. My son liked this one too, and wed give it a B+.

AnchorsAweighscreenAnchors Aweigh (1945, 143 min., 1.37:1 ratio, trailer) Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly star as sailors on leave in Los Angeles in this old-time musical with a patriotic tone. Kelly is a womanizer with a girl in every port, while Sinatra plays a naive Brooklyn boy who just wants to find the right woman for him. Kelly is trying to hook up with old flame Lola, but a small boy running away at night to join the Navy derails him. Since the boy seems enthralled by the two sailors, a cop asks them to go with him to return the lad to his home. Hes an orphan whose father was killed in action and who lives with his Aunt Susie (Kathryn Grayson), an entertainer and aspiring actress. Sinatra is convinced that Aunt Susie is the woman for him, and the rest of the film follows Kellys attempts to coach him, while also clearly falling for Susie. Both get involved in a little white lie about arranging an audition for her with conductor Jos Iturbi, who plays himself. Pamela Britton stars as the Girl from Brooklyn in this musical, which seems long at times but is engaging because of the characters. Its a solid B.

Oceans11screenOceans 11 (1960, 127 min., 2.40:1 widescreen, trailer)Contemporary caper films have gotten so action-packed and crisply paced that this early heist movie will seem excruciatingly slow in the first act when were introduced to the 11 major characters in what seems like an overly long round-up of an old Army unit by former Sgt. Danny Ocean (Sinatra) and his lieutenant, Jimmy Foster (Peter Lawford). But it takes a full hour for them to introduce the guys (Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Conte, Joey Bishop, Henry Silva, Buddy Lester, Richard Benedict, Norman Fell, Clem Harvey) when the interest picks up and we actually hear their plan of knocking off five Las Vegas casinos simultaneously on New Years Eve. Complicating matters: one of them is deathly ill, Oceans ex-wife (Angie Dickinson) and ex-mistress (Patrice Wymore) cause problems, and another deals with the discomfort of his rich mother marrying a well-known racketeer. Sinatra doesnt sing but Rat Pack pals Martin and Davis Jr. get to do a few numbers. Aside from a slow first hour, the films other shortcoming is a single attempt at a running joke that gets old after the first two times. But the caper itself is interesting enough to where what might have been a C movie ends up being a B-.

OntheTownscreenOn the Town (1949, 98 min., 1.37:1 ratio, trailer)What was once one of the strongest films might be the weakest for families, because what little plot there is seems like nothing more than glue to hold together a random collection of song-and-dance numbers that will strike contemporary viewers as even more old-fashioned than the other forties entry in this collection. Once again Sinatra and Gene Kelly play sailors on leave, this time in New York City and this time with sailor pal Ozzie (Jules Munshin). They take a taxi, and a female cabbie (Betty Garrett) and her roommate (Alice Pearce) become a part of their shore leave as they tour (and wreck) a museum and see the other sights of New York City, while Kelly pursues a woman named Ivy (Vera-Ellen). Call it a condensed version of Anchors Aweigh without the added interest of the kid, without as much character development or romance, and with more songs. If your family watches classic TV, the most interest might come from seeing Pearce (nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on Bewitched) and Garrett (Edna Babish on Laverne & Shirley) in different roles. Grade: C+/B-.

Language: N/A
Sex: N/A
Violence: One comic bar brawl in Guys and Dolls
Adult situations: Drinking and smoking and flappers in Robin and the 7 Hoods
Takeaways: Old-time musicals really looked like fun for the actors, and Sinatra held his own as both a song-and-dance man and a dramatic actor

""Guys and Dolls"" is a well done presentation of the Broadway Show captured on film by Samuel Goldwyn's pure love of the show. Frank, Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine are the primary actors portraying the characters who provide a true recreation of the show on film.
""Ocean's 11"" with a host of well-loved entertainers and actors who create a plan operated with military precision to steal the banks from every casino at the same time. Everything works perfectly until one of the members has a heart attack when crossing a street. What an ending!
""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" this film has a few nifty things associated with it. Hear Peter Falk sing, Listen to the commentary provided by Frank Sinatra Jr. and his relating of some of his father's dislike for some of the things that occurred during the filming - primarily, the assassination of JFK in 1963.

You also see Gene dance with the cartoon character from Tom and Jerry.  On the Town, which recently had its Broadway revival has much fun and great dancing by Vera-ellen and the great Ann Miller.
