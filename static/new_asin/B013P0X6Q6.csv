There are some of characters that are so twisted and weird (the polar bear, walrus and seagull) and so differently and cleverly conceived (saying this as an American) that I couldn't help but be charmed. Also, it is a little less frenetic than most of the other kids' fare on Amazon, which is nice since I have a high energy 2yo (we watched this together). All in all, a charming production that does its own thing, moves at its own pace and is charmingly captivating. The theme song is super weird and catchy too.",1514678400,,619,4.535714285714286

8728326,4,B013P0X6Q6,"This is a clever show for very young children. My 4 year old enjoyed it, and my older boys got a few laughs out of the funny situations while watching it with their younger brother. There are no conversations between characters, as a matter of fact I didn't notice even a single word being spoken, instead the characters make noises that make them sound similar to the Minions. :) Overall, my kids thought it was fun to watch!",1453852800,,426,4.4743589743589745
8728327,5,B013P0X6Q6,"This movie has unexpectedly become a big part of our night time routine! I don't know what it is about Naya and her friends - but my son and daughter just can't get enough of these adorable animated characters. The fact that there are no real words or dialogue seems to level the playing field for my 1 and 5 year olds and they can both find enjoyment in a movie (which I find rare these days). This movie gives us a good ""calm down"" routine at the end of the evening- and each story is short enough that we can say ""you can watch one story"" and then move on to the next step in our routine. Your children will love figuring things out with Naya and her buddies- it's a fun adventure!",1449619200,,684,4.111940298507463

5*****!",1449532800,,42,5.142857142857143
8728329,4,B013P0X6Q6,I was a little surprised by the characters not speaking but it did not bother my almost 2 year old one bit! She enjoyed watching each character and their 'silliness' (as she would say). Each story provided enough entertainment to keep her interested and laughing! Such a fun winter themed DVD!,1449532800,,293,4.764705882352941
8728330,4,B013P0X6Q6,"My daughter enjoys this DVD more than I do. She really likes the various animals and the antics they get into. The characters don't speak to each other. They communicate through grunts and hand signals. That's the part I don't care for as much, but my daughter doesn't mind and I guess that's what really matters! I do really like that at the beginning of each episode, the title of the episode is read out loud! That's great for pre-readers or early readers! Usually, my daughter asks me what it says (on other DVDs). She can read, but not fast enough for the few seconds that titles are flashed on screen for.",1449100800,,611,4.464285714285714
8728331,5,B013P0X6Q6,"This movie is very sweet and perfect to watch during the winter season! my daughter loved how animated the animal characters interaction was and how they always seemed to find themselves in a pickle! Do note that the characters do not speak, they grunt at each other every once in a while but there is not actual speaking so if your kiddo does not do well with more silent films it might be something to watch when they are a little older. But my daughter loved this!",1449100800,,467,4.379310344827586
