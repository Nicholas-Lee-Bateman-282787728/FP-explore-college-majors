7979328,2,B000087F2D,"The fact that ""Operation Cobra"" is one of the most disregarded and neglected of Don Wilson's films is kind of sad. On the commentary track of the DVD, director Fred Olen Ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lair/dp/B000UAE7NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lair</a>) not only describes the considerable physical and cultural hardships that had to be overcome to make this movie, but also the fact that it is the first American feature to be shot entirely on-location in India. Sure, this isn't the most exciting distinction a film can have, but it's a distinction nonetheless for a movie starring an action hero who has so few cinematic merits to his name. Of course, the fact that it really is just a run-of-the-mill karate B-movie downplays this fact and probably had the most to do with the film's ongoing obscurity. If you're a Wilson fan, do yourself a treat and get one of the few films of his with special features; if you've never heard of the man or weren't impressed with his work to begin with, don't count on this one to initiate you as a fan.

The story: following the murder of his partner (Rick Hill,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deathstalker/dp/B00005NOP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deathstalker</a>&nbsp;series), government agent Kyle Connors (Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;series) pursues killer/international terrorist Johan Davaad (Evan Lurie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hologram-Man/dp/B000EXDRMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hologram Man</a>) to India, where he will have to deal with danger, romance, and sabotage if he hopes to complete his mission.

Parts of the movie have definitely been designed to give them a ""James Bond""-esque feel, but as a whole, the film just sits there as a big lump of non-intrigue. The plot isn't overly-complicated but its intricacies are played off so in such a convoluted manner that I stopped paying attention to why anybody was doing anything at about the halfway point. Despite being topped by an unconventional Wilson/Lurie swordfight, the six fight scenes display the same shoddy camera angles and quick-cut editing found in most of the Wilson's films and are in no condition to amaze. The film's only real asset is the authentic locales of Chennai, India, which are fun to look at. Additionally, the cast includes Bollywood stars Madhaven (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Peck-on-the-Cheek/dp/B000PHX4FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Peck on the Cheek</a>) and Dipti Bhatnagar (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uljhan/dp/B0049C7G5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uljhan</a>), although their importance to the film as characters is limited...(SPOILER) not to mention that the former dies about halfway through. There are a couple scenes wherein turncoat/Sophia Crawford-lookalike Tane McClure (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scorned-2/dp/6305026033/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scorned 2</a>) goes topless, but don't count on them lasting long enough to hold your interest for the rest of the movie.

I wish there was more I could write about ""Operation Cobra"", but it's just too bland to waste anymore space on. Decent production values keep it from being among Wilson's very worst, but hey, even the very worst might be more fun to watch if it broke the mundanity of this one.",1295481600,,3606,6.555555555555555
