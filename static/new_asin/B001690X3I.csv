8261667,3,B001690X3I,"Eldridge Cleaver is one of the most fascinating, complex, controversial and, yes, entertaining figures of the 20th Century. He is not done justice by Skip Gates' documentary profile, which amounts to little more than a boring, self-agrandizing college lecture. Gates (to no surprise to those familiar with the work of this egomaniac) gives himself as much face and speaking time as his subjects.  He uses only two sources, Cleaver, who is lucid, charming and brilliant, and his ex-wife, Kathleen Cleaver, who is intelligent and political. Gates seems less interested in discussing the history of Cleaver than in getting the man to wade into pallid discussions about contemporary debates, such as the rising black middle class and affirmative action. Cleaver does his best to liven up the interview, but Gates always seems to cut away to one of his trite monologues when Cleaver is beginning to heat up. The documentary would lead you to believe that the couple split up because of exhaustion and Cleaver's turn to the right. In fact, Cleaver's womanizing and drug use were really to blame.

Cleaver was a complex man. He is revered because he had courage and spoke the truth about race without ever flinching. Gates can be forgiven for whitewashing his history in this documentary, but not for giving himself equal billing.  However, in the end, there is very little out there on Cleaver and any film on the man has enough tidbits to make it worth the time. Cleaver's take on Louis Farakhan was worth the price of admission.",1322870400,3,1524,4.9453125
8261668,5,B001690X3I,"What is important to note is that Eldridge Cleaver would always be the first to analyze his mistakes and try to change them. Meeting James Baldwin in 1968, changing his views towards the writer/activist was one such step. One must understand the climate of the 60s and the urgency to define ""Black manhood"" in the presence of a savagely repressive America system. The jolt of extremity was needed in order to counter balance/shake up the status quo. As a ""writer, solider, warrior"" Cleaver prompted the masses and influenced others to use the pen as a tool for expression with warts and all. Noah, was not a perfect man nor did he heed his path towards alcohol but it was this such ""in-perfect"" individual who constructed and moved the masses in a vessel called the Ark. Eldridge Cleaver never professed to be above any other and the years of exile, disillusions anyone torn away from their home and community. Cleaver had no moral support, he was geographically and mentally exiled for years. The various radical shifts in his later life are an example of how schizophrenic many 60s radicals became due to the success of Cointelpro's actions in the US and abroad.

""It's like condemning a man who tried to quit smoking in a room full of smokers""",1217030400,4,1246,4.741935483870968
8261669,3,B001690X3I,"This work is important in the way that studying and interpreting any famed Black leader or thinker is important.  This might be a great documentary to watch alongside the film ""Panther.""

I have intense reservations about A&E Biography installments that are gushy love fests on Republican and other right-wing officials.  Here, I was similarly worried that Cleaver had to be placed in a good light in order to capture an interview from him.  Dr. Gates had the nerve to call Cleaver ""the James Baldwin of the proloteriat.""  Cleaver specifically wrote homophobic things against Baldwin.  The work does admit that Cleaver was originally imprisoned for rape.  But no one ever asks, ""Why should a Black leader be embraced who clearly has shown hatred and violence toward gays and women?""  This reminds me of bell hooks' ""Remember Rapture: A Writing Life"" in which she gushed about Jessie Faucet just because Ms. Faucet agreed to visit one of her English classes one day.

The gem of this work was hearing from Cleaver's ex-wife Kathleen.  She seems like a powerful, right-on, impressive sista!  I wonder if she merits the attention that Coretta Scott King and Betty Shabazz used to garner.  Still, Malcolm X said though his father was a Garveyite, his father still fancied his mother because she had light skin.  I wonder if Eldridge loved Kathleen too because she is light.

In the outstanding text, ""Paris Noir"" about African Americans in France, the author admits that though Black Americans found refuse from racism in Paris, besides Josephine Baker, most kept their American citizenship and eventually came home.  Here, Cleaver admits that he was greatly upset by the dictatorship of the protoleriat enacted by communist governments who presented themselves as striving for equality.  He straight up admitted that police corruption is not one ounce as bad in Oakland as it was in many of the developing countries, communist and non-communist, that he'd seen.  I hate to provide ammo points for right-wingers, but Cleaver's interview proves how many of those most critical of the US also cling to it or wouldn't want to be anywhere else permanently.

The work does imply that Cleaver may have had some mental health issues.  It appears that Cleaver began embracing the right wing and his nemesis Ronald Reagan.  Cleaver was able to assess the good and bad parts of the Panther Party.  However, I was saddened to hear him say that there is no current Black leader that he admires.  What about Bobby Rush?  Rush is a Panther who is not hiding out from the police or living in exile: he's a long term Congressman whose voting record is not radical.

This work mentions the Watts Riots at least twice, but the LA Riots of 1992, surprisingly, don't come up at all.  I think many viewers, across racial identities, may want to watch this work alongside a recent one on the Weather Underground.  Both will get viewers into that 60s, fight-the-power! mood.",1213401600,3,2947,4.926977687626775
