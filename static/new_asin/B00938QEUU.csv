5254002,3,B00938QEUU,"There's a lot to enjoy in this ""zombie musical"": it's very professional (I say that because I believe it was shot on a very shoestring budget), it seamlessly shifts from horror to comedy to musical, and the actors are outstanding.

And I want to give a special kudos to Sarah Lassez: she's amazing.  She acts, she sings, she looks fantastic.  She's someone I definitely want to see more of (and someone I'll be looking back to see more of her work).

My only problem with this film is some confusion caused by the script.  Sarah's character is possessed by an invading spirit at one point in the story.  When she's shown being haunted in spooky scenes after that, I was a little unsure about what I was supposed to feel: is that the Sarah we cared about fighting back to regain her body...and should she be treated like a dark presence now?

Still, an enjoyable film that makes me want to see more of these filmmakers.  And especially Sarah Lassez.",1358467200,,948,4.535294117647059
5254003,4,B00938QEUU,Fantastically produced and performed. Very original and fun to watch. The singing is excellent as well as the songs. A lot of fun.,1356825600,,130,4.695652173913044
5254004,5,B00938QEUU,"Travis Betz is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.  His knack for witty, well written dialogue and small cast indie film making shine in this film.  One of these days somebody is going to give Travis the money and freedom to express his creativity on a larger scale, but for now we a left with gems like The Dead Inside and Lo- his previous foray into demonic fantasy.  No one in Hollywood has the balls to even pitch a zombie musical and Mr. Betz pulls it off on what I can only imagine was a shoestring budget. This film is ambitious yet simple in it's storytelling and I guarantee the songs contained within will be stuck in your head for days.

Watch this movie and tell your friends about it!",1354838400,6,708,4.3816793893129775

5254006,4,B00938QEUU,"The fact that there's a zombie in a movie, doesn't necessarily make it a zombie movie. I liked this movie. It was convoluted but I definitely liked it...mostly. Kind of. It was totally worth watching. The singing was good and the characters were very likable. The singing was good and I thought the actors did a good job of, you know, acting. Anyway, I know nothing about the actors, director or producer but I feel like they got 76% there with this movie and from someone who maintained, a solid D average throughout high school, that's high praise.",1491609600,,550,4.622448979591836
5254007,5,B00938QEUU,"This movie is such a fresh twist to both the zombie & possession genres.  It is a movie musical about the possession of a zombie horror novelist.  I'm not revealing more than that.  But wait, don't let the idea of a horror musical turn you off.  At first, I thought this wasn't going to be worth my time.  I'm glad I had second thoughts and watched it anyway.  It was comical, suspenseful, romantic (yes, in a horror movie), and very well done.  What little gore that was in the movie was very realistic and not over-the-top.  I absolutely loved this movie.  There were a lot of twists and turns.  It was very well written and directed, and the acting was top notch.  I will watch this one again.  It is destined to be a cult classic.",1487894400,,734,4.3161764705882355
5254008,5,B00938QEUU,"This director likes tragedies so if you have to have a happy ending then you might want to pass on their movies.  However if you are looking for something that is immensely entertaining, beautifully odd and tremendously thought provoking then give them a shot.

The Dead Inside is about a spirit that takes over the body of woman and tries to take her life including her boyfriend. Thats what its about the bare bones and nothing else. Like with everything it is so much more than its bones, its beauty is in the flesh and meat that's wrapped around those bones. When it ended my girl asked me what I thought it was about, I had to stop and think on that for a minute.

First off how many movies do even get asked that question? In out digital world we like movies that fit into neat boxes, action, mystery, thriller we've all feasted on these till we were gluttonous our skin ripping at the seems. But a movie thats not only entertaining but leaves you better than when you started? Well I can't think of the last one that I've seen.

Back to that strange question my wonderfully different girl asked me. She told me she thought it was about not taking your happiness for granted. I told her that I liked to think of it as making sure we focus on the right things in our lives. Problems exist, real crippling problems that twist and turn with poisonous desire. We all know that. But good things exist too. Like spending a night watching a movie with my girl and knowing I was with the love of my life.

I like to think that message is threaded with the idea that the things we hate sometimes turn out to be very things worth living for. I hated driving when I was young, it terrified me. Now I love to take long drives at night. That's a simple one and disfigures the very point I'm trying to make but I imagine if your reading this you get where I'm coming from.

I didn't like the ending, it felt slapped on like a piece of rotting flesh when you've already got a good Frankenstein walking. But that doesn't diminsh the gorgeous strangeness of the movie. It isn't for everyone, in fact I only know one or two people I'd recommend the movie to but for those few it will instantly hook in you guts and pull out your large intestines.",1486339200,,2234,4.31980906921241

5254013,1,B00938QEUU,"I should premis this by mentioning I loved Lo.  It is an absolute masterpiece, which is what influenced my purchase of The Dead Inside.  I can count on less than one hand the number of times in my adult life I've finished a movie or a story so horribly ended that I walked it straight to the trash.  What sucked was I was really digging this quirky little film up till that last shot...  What a waste.",1472601600,,401,4.1688311688311686
5254014,5,B00938QEUU,a truly fantastic work that proves you can make a good film on a low budget. the songs are catchy as can be and the story is amazingly written.,1465430400,,143,3.9655172413793105
5254015,5,B00938QEUU,"The Dead Inside (2011) not to be confused with the Dead Inside (2013), is a charming story about a struggling writer and her photographer boyfriend. Shes stuck writing a zombie story, and they're both daydreaming about a zombie apocalypse. One day our photographer comes home with a gift, something he found at a wedding. The writer begins to breakdown. The film is fraught with twists.

The actors were on point. Camera work was great.

The majority of the scenes are shot in one location, a realistic apartment of two artist. It was either excellently decorated, or like most indies shot in someones actual apartment. There is a second apartment where the characters in the writers story appear. Also realistically decorated.

Five stars based on this being an indie movie.",1437350400,,775,4.992248062015504

5254019,3,B00938QEUU,"While the back of the DVD does offer a slight synopsis, I was honestly a bit surprised as to where the narrative actually ended up going.  It's a mish-mash of genres which break the story from its initial zombie-inspired roots.  Because of the ambitious plotline, the film does tend to drag at points.  When it does, this is where I expected the music to alleviate some of the boredom I was feeling.  Sadly, only a couple of the songs are worthwhile (worse is that the deleted song--in the extras--is one of the best!  And it was cut out!  Wha--?).  Having said that, the two main actors are phenomenal and truly convey a believable chemistry.  Ultimately, I dug The Dead Inside, but I still need to wrap my head around it and give it another go.  It's not constantly entertaining and some of the scenes do tend to drag, but I was nonetheless very moved by the outcome of the narrative.

It's not your common horror flick but should be applauded for doing something quite different.  It may not hit all of the right notes, but I'd definitely recommend if for those wanting something different, affectionate and honesty, downright heartbreaking.

And I gotta say, the lenticular slip-cover that slides over it is awesome.",1387497600,,1220,4.702830188679245
5254020,5,B00938QEUU,"My new favorite musical.  If you love zombies alongside a good musical, you'll love this movie.  Awesome music with a great story.",1383004800,,130,4.863636363636363
5254021,1,B00938QEUU,"Are these people serious.  This movie was terrible.  The reviews call this a musical, hahaha! The entire movie is shot in the same house with a man and woman and they cannot act. The dialog is boring and the singing nearly made me puke. Anybody can make this low budget garbage. Just imagine putting 2 of your friends in a house and filming them all day talking and then karaoke singing. Sounds dumb right?  That is exactly what this is.  The only difference is they change into amateur looking zombies from time to time.  Some reviewer said they were going to download the soundtrack.  No one in their Right mind would download this crap.  The music sounded like it Was produced by William Hung haha.  I could have done just as bad a job trying to sing.  If you don't believe me then go waste your money and you will regret it.  I turned this off after 20 minutes because it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1363046400,,921,4.333333333333333
5254022,4,B00938QEUU,"The Dead Inside is an indie zombie musical. I'm not sure there are any others. Fi (Sarah Lassez) and Wes (Dustin Fasching) both suffer from a lack of inspiration for their respective jobs. Fi is a frustrated zombie book writer, and Wes is a frustrated wedding photographer. Fi's book is played out onscreen by Lassez and Fasching, as zombies Harper and Max. Their dilemma, being stuck at a locked door, is where the story is at a standstill. Emily is a spirit who inhabits Fi's body, and interestingly, cures her writer's block.

There were a couple of scenes that were startling to me: Wes finds Fi/Emily with a flashlight, covered in blood; and Fi's ghost floats over Wes' body. I thought this movie was amazing, but I have a minor gripe: The music is very flat. It sounds as if every instrument was recorded at the same level, and in mono. Contrasting that is the deleted song, which sounds much more dynamic. Odd. I don't have 5.1, so maybe it's better with that.

I thought the title The Dead Inside was plain and uninspired, but in actuality it has multiple meanings: Dead Emily lives inside of Fi's body; You might say that Fi and Wes are dead inside creatively; and outside of the opening sequence, the movie plays out entirely inside.

The extras on this DVD are:
- About 36 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, including many bloopers and tests
- Deleted song, ""What Is Wrong""
- Audio commentary with Travis Betz (writer/director) and Shannon Hourigan (cinematographer)
- Audio commentary with Travis Betz, Sarah Lassez, and Dustin Fasching
- Trailer",1361232000,4,1561,4.795539033457249
5254023,5,B00938QEUU,"Since words often fail...sing it in a song. I am an avid Travis Betz fan. Anything he makes, i love. The Dead Inside filled the hole i needed for a dark, comedic, horror musical. I'm a horror head, but extremely picky. The Dead Inside not only has some of the most catching songs (how catchy? i raced to my computer to download the soundtrack after watching less than twenty minutes), it is also filled with heart, tasty hearts. The filming is also beautiful, each frame is candy for the soul.
The plot is also wonderful, it throws out a twist and i cannot remark any further on that! it just has...exceptional writing, acting and music. In a world were the worst movies possible get huge budgets and promotions left and right... i often feel ill. How can a load of .... get a budget and yet one of the most creative teams, gets almost nothing? and yet make something a thousand times better???
 I love love love The Dead Inside. I hope you will give it a chance, because it certainly deserves one, and i guarantee you will not regret it.",1360627200,6,1038,4.43455497382199
5254024,3,B00938QEUU,"Fiona or Fi (Sarah Lassez) is a zombie story author who lives off cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar. These are clearly gateways for demonic possession. She lives in a brightly painted apartment which gives the film a surreal setting. ""The Dead Inside"" is a novel she is writing. The zombies in the film are part of the book. This is not per se, a zombie film.

Wes (Dustin Fasching) is a wedding photographer and her live-in boyfriend. Fiona has writer's block which she cannot overcome.

***MIDPOINT PLOT SPOILER*** We come to find out Fiona is possessed by an ""evil"" spirit named Emily, who is less dark than Fi. The film deals with the odd relationship she develops with Wes.

The production is interesting as you keep wondering how much is real, imagination, or mental illness and whose. The musical numbers are different, with Sarah being the stronger of the two voices. The music didn't seem to add anything to the story which lacked great entertainment quality in this two man play. The film does show talent on the part of writer/directer Travis Betz, but he needs to bring it home. This is clearly not a film for everyone and a disappointment for anyone expecting real zombie action. I still haven't figured out if I liked it or not. It is one of those odd movies.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity (Sarah Lassez), implied sex.  Walmart $9.96 with clever slip cover that made me buy it.",1359936000,2,1401,4.725409836065574

8535086,1,B00938QEUU,So glad I didn't actually have to pay for this. I wish the summary mentioned that it's a damn musical!,1504828800,,102,4.15
8535087,3,B00938QEUU,"I really got into this horror/comedy/musical. The writing is witty and the actors delivery's have great timing and heart. The two leads can really sing and if you can look past budgetary constraints, you'll really like this. Like with Lo, Betz shows a lot of promise in a Joss Whedon kind of way, balancing genre expectations with humor, toying with audience expectations, finding new humor in old subjects, and bringing in original concepts. His writing is so good, you find yourself almost as amused and invested in the fictional b-story as you do the a-story.

My one complaint is a huge one though. The last minute of the film, the ending, kind of ruins the whole thing. I'm not going to spoil it, but it is unsatisfying, abrupt, and incomplete at best... at worst, it completely betrays the audience's investment. While the idea behind the ending could have been done in a passable manner, with heart and closure, instead, it happens in ~5 seconds and the movie ends before we get character reactions, much less resolution. The intended twist ending becomes just a shock ending with all the grace and sensitivity of poking someone in the eye.",1503619200,,1147,4.822335025380711
8535088,5,B00938QEUU,"This is a refreshingly unique film that flies criminally under the radar. It expertly blends together not only multiple genres like comedy, horror and musicals, but various subsets of those genres like zombies and possession as well. It's a delicate balancing act, but writer/director Travis Betz manages to pull off a miraculous juggling act keeping all these elements in the air and flowing naturally. Equally impressive is the fact that the whole film relies on the 2 main characters who must carry off all the facets of this almost singlehandedly and yet Sarah Lassez and Dustin Fasching manage to pull off the impossible.

  The story follows a couple, one a photographer, the other a horror novelist who are both currently struggling in their field, but are devoted to each other. Things begin to unravel however when a malevolent force begins to take over the woman and tries to take over every aspect of her life. Though this sounds like a simple concept it actually is every bit as layered as the number of genres it traverses to tell the tale. It can be at times both uplifting and heartbreaking,  tense and yet hilarious, but what it never is for one second is conventional. This is a truly rare and dazzling attempt to breathe new life into the artform by telling it's story in a way that we haven't really seen before and would never see in big budget cinema. It really is the epitome of what indie-filmmaking should be all about. It won't be for everyone as the story refuses to pull punches as the plot progresses and the unconventional blend of genres won't be for everyone. However for anyone seeking something they haven't seen before among the piles of cookie cutter films out there today this one is well worth seeking out.",1500163200,2,1743,4.742574257425742
8535089,5,B00938QEUU,This was honestly so good. I loved the music and the story and could totally relate to Fi. In the beginning. When she was writing. I can't say I've ever been possessed by a ghost. But just the movie was great and I loved it.,1499731200,,224,4.0

I kept watching, and I'm glad I did, because it turned out to be a really interesting story and I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.
