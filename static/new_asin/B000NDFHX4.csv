2765066,5,B000NDFHX4,"This DVD on the Tower of London is great!  It's very informative, includes loads of history, and is presented in a very interesting way!  I have visited the Tower of London twice, and watched this DVD after my first visit.  Knowing so much more about the TOL made me enjoy my second visit so much more!",1200873600,4,302,4.357142857142857
2765067,5,B000NDFHX4,"I lived in London for six years and every minute was wonderful!  I visited the Tower numerous times.  I knew a lot about the Tower, but this DVD exposed much more in-depth than I could have imagined!  It goes into stories that most people would never know, nor will have the opportunity to know.  It shows ceremonies which have NEVER before been seen by the public.  It enters places that are ""off limits"" to the public.  Truly an excellent exploration of the Tower!  I cannot recommend it higher!",1199836800,25,497,4.579545454545454
2765068,5,B000NDFHX4,"Koch Vision present ""THE TOWER"" (2001) (384 mins/Color) (Widescreen/Dolby Digital) --- The rich history of the Tower of London is examined in this eight part show --- The historic building is examined in detail, and CGI technology is used to recreate scenes from the Tower's illustrious past --- Channel Four has taken it upon itself to try to separate the romance from the truth with an eight part documentary called The Tower --- Each of the eight episodes focus on one specific aspect of the construct --- The program breaks the tower down to be examined from every relevant physical and historical angle --- At nearly eight hours in total, it would seem to be thorough, but in many ways the series just touches the tip of the iceberg, but what an iceberg it is!

Koch Vision Entertainment has released this 2001 production in a two DVD set that is well presented visually, with an outstanding narration by Sean Pertwee --- The Tower is a very entertaining primer on the history of this English landmark --- notice the tabloid style of production here, as The Tower is truly an awe-inspiring piece of work for the viewer to soak up --- as sturdy and affecting as The Tower itself --- the true story of Britain's most notorious past and living history of The Tower of London --- is as good as it gets!

2765069,4,B000NDFHX4,"Made for British Television, this is a great documentary about the history of The Tower Of London.  From it's beginnings under the Normans to present day this dvd takes you on an historical journey through the walls of one of the most famous structures in the world.  A little dated-London's skyline outside the tower has changed dramatically since this was filmed, but the historical accuracy makes this a real treat for history buffs.  Having visited the tower, I remember seeing this particular program on offer on vhs in the gift shop but was unable to purchase it since it inevitably wouldn't be able to be played on my North American vcr.  I am glad to see such programs on offer at Amazon.",1185494400,,696,4.680327868852459
2765070,5,B000NDFHX4,"This 8 part series on the Tower of London originally aired on Channel 4 in the UK.  It's incredibly well done, fascinating, and is recommended viewing for anyone interested in military history, architecture, British history and the British monarchy.",1183420800,8,249,5.384615384615385
2765081,1,B000NDFHX4,"I was very interested to watch this video on netflix. However it was unwatchable. The sound of the trumpets and keyboards drown out the narrator. The copies of this video should be scrapped, remixed, then rereleased. The tower is a great place to visit, as I had a tour several years ago.

 Shame on the company that released this.",1339200000,5,331,4.593220338983051
2765082,4,B000NDFHX4,"Interesting mini-series has a little of something for everyone. I watched it because when I was in London I had a great time at the Tower. At one point I asked a question of one of the Yeoman Warders in the armory and he lit up, going into great detail. That wonderful enthusiasm comes across in the series.

Overal I thought this was a decent mini-series. The filmmaker interwove contemporary and history themes. The three things I would have liked to have seen handled better:

1. More and varied shots of the Crown Jewels.

2. The topic of the Princes in the Tower made a very weak attempt to convey the controversy.

3. Better sound editing. The sound editing was very poor on some episodes.

I watched all the episodes streamed from Netflx and may do so again. I am not sure I would pay $25 for it (the current price) even though the content was good. I would rather wait for a remixed version.",1336262400,3,899,4.424242424242424
2765083,1,B000NDFHX4,"This could have been an excellent documentary, but instead it is garbage due almost solely to the horrendous sound editing and mixing.  I cannot believe how bad the editors and mixers are in this.  I have to agree completely with another reviewer that there is no way that the producers ever watched this.  Unless the sound techs, mixers, directors, editors and producers are all deaf.  I do not care if this is the first time any of them actually had a job, you cannot hear what you cannot hear.  Blaring horns and trumpets completely wipe out the narration.  In one segment that have the narrator reading something, while at the same time some guy from Canada is reading the same thing.  Unfortunately, they are not in synch, the tracks are equal in level, so you cannot understand anything.

Pathetic!!!",1332720000,2,806,4.748201438848921
2765084,2,B000NDFHX4,"This seems to have been a problem others have experienced. Even on Netflix this series is unwatchable: The ""background music"" is significantly louder than the narrator, making it near impossible to decipher more than 25% of what he's saying. If you enjoy documentaries, you know how important narration is. This wouldn't be the end of the world if there were subtitles/closed captioning. Though it is advertised to include that, THIS SERIES IS NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED. It's really a shame to see something that could be great be completely unwatchable due to extremely poor sound editing, as if the producers of this series never even actually watched their own final product.",1331510400,6,673,5.127272727272727
2765085,1,B000NDFHX4,"Too bad a one star rating is required. It deserves zero stars. I bought the set and had to return it. (NO CCs as advertised by Amazon.com) It is a shame such a otherwise good work could have been ruined by the terrible sound. Mushy mouth narration punctuated incessantly by drums, horns and many other useless noises too numerous and wierd to describe. At one point there was something a child described as a giant dragon burp. First behead the the narrator and get someone that can enunciate, (at the very least insist he finish his porridge before recording), include CCs and/or subtitiles(Amazon advertised CCs) and reissue the DVDs. I would REALLY like to HEAR and see them all.",1316476800,3,682,4.739495798319328
2765086,5,B000NDFHX4,"If you're interested in the Tower of London specifically, or just British history in general, this is a really good program.

It gives a very good explanation of the workings of the Tower today and also gives some interesting stories of what's happened in the Tower in the past.  I've been to the Tower of London and taken the tour guided by a yeoman warder, and there are stories in this series that I hadn't heard before.

I enjoyed it very much!",1302912000,,448,4.439024390243903
2765087,5,B000NDFHX4,"My husband and I have been fortunate enough to have visited the Tower twice, and were fascinated by it's history.  We thought we knew alot about the Tower but after seeing this, we realized how we had just scratched the surface.  This is very well done, beautifully filmed and reinacted.  It is never boring or ""too filled"" with facts.  There is a wonderful contempory presentation of a gentlemen preparing to become a Yeoman Warder and move into the Tower as a residence that was very  interesting. We have really enjoyed this.",1291161600,,528,4.758241758241758
2765088,5,B000NDFHX4,"This DVD chronicles the history of the Tower of London. It's done in a very interesting way and caught my attention from the beginning.  My children and grandchildren have watched it also, and have the same opinion as I. I highly recommend it to any audience.",1225152000,3,259,4.630434782608695
2765089,5,B000NDFHX4,"We were planning a trip to London, and the Tower of London was certainly near the top of the list of places to visit.  We found this DVD while searching the web, but couldn't find it in any store, so we ordered it hoping we would get it before going to London, but we didn't and had to watch it when we got back.

Naturally we learned many of the things on the DVD when we visited the Tower (which was fantastic by the way), but there were many more things on the DVD that we didn't know.  The behind the scenes, after hours things that happen at the Tower on the DVD were very interesting, and the dramatizations make the historical stories entertaining.

If you are at all interested in the Tower of London, or English history, I highly recommend this DVD.",1216944000,2,758,4.27972027972028

8177005,5,B000NDFHX4,"History buffs and anyone traveling to London who wants to get an overview of London history from the perspective of the Tower of London, theis DVD was one of the best, if not the best, we watched in preparation for our trip to the UK. Trust me, you'll appreciate being more educated about London history, whether you travel there or now. And, this DVD presents it all in a very enjoyable format. The only drawback is it can be difficult to obtain.",1456185600,,447,4.463414634146342
8177006,5,B000NDFHX4,"Didn't have great reviews on Netflix, doesn't seem to have great reviews here, but it's one of my favorite miniseries. The sound balance is off a little bit, but it's wonderfully detailed with great behind-the-scenes details. Much more than those documentaries where the filmmakers took a camera on your basic tour. It goes through the complete history of the tower, and has tons of cool facts and scraps for history buffs.",1439856000,,423,4.971830985915493

8177009,3,B000NDFHX4,"I was  disappointed by the Saturday, afternoon nothing else is on T.V feeling of this lame documentary.
There wasn't a lot of substance to this, in one episode they are in America chasing down some letter
in the city of Charleston.. who cares!!?? why??!!!
The letter  is some American ancestor, again why who cares. I didn't buy a Historical Documentary about the tower of London
to watch Americans go to the south! I am an American-I see them all the time.
 The only reason why I bought this was to get a comprehensive overview of the tower
They mention that William the conquer built it (is that right? I learned Nothing!) and that is something I would like
to know-how long was it someone's house? How long did it take to build-why was it built where it was built, those kind of things.
Another episode they talk about the famous Jewels that was pretty interesting, but than they go on and on
about Colonel Blood, and the next thing you know once again they are no longer in the Tower of London, but here
there everywhere. Lots of bad reenactments- its choppy there is nothing snuggly about it.
No feeling of sinking into stone cold knowledge...just B.S boring afternoon filler type narration
it really sucks",1382572800,,1211,4.623255813953488
8177010,4,B000NDFHX4,"This is an excellent historical history of the Tower of London and goes into interesting, if not well known facts and history of the famous Tower Of London.  Good historical analysis by subject experts, good if not dated computer graphics about the Tower, and interesting tidbits of everyday rituals of the Tower such as the role of the Beef Eaters in the Key Ceremony which has occured nightly for over 400 years.  The series is divided into historical segments and funtions of the Tower such as the role of the Tower in history, the Crown Jewels, the Towers role throughout history as a fortress, prison, and safe guarding the Crown Jewels.  The only distraction of the series is the editing of the sound, and the interviews with a few experts during public tours of the tour and the sound behind the interviews.  My criticism is that I am sure that the interviews could of been made after hours where a constant flow of people in the scenes was very distracting.  Some of the sound in the DVD's is quite loud and distracts at times.  Overall though, this is a good series for anyone interested in the famous Tower of London, its history, and the function of the Tower today. Recommended!",1374019200,,1190,4.642857142857143
8177011,5,B000NDFHX4,"Saw most of this series on Netflix before it was deleted from availability of streaming customers.

This series is historically accurate and offered in a concise but entertaining fashion. Anyone interested in this part of History should enjoy having it for the collection.",1362960000,,272,5.325581395348837
8177012,5,B000NDFHX4,"When I first placed the order for this item, I thought it was a book. I was a little surprised when I received a DVD, but WOW! It is a four hour history of the Tower of London on two discs. It was not only entertaining, but had more information about the Tower then I could have gotten from four books. Wonderful documentary with lots of good information presented in a very entertaining and enjoyable format!",1341619200,,409,4.394736842105263
