8425434,5,B004DK5SWS,"I loved this show since first watching it at my grandma's house in the Dominican Republic. It is so cool in spanish. I tried watching it with the english dub but it was way retarded. They need to get better voice characters because this show is sooo awesome.
This memorial box is nicely done and comes with a cool collector's coin that I carry around everywhere I go. Couldn't be happier with the purchase :D",1366416000,,408,4.453333333333333
8425435,4,B004DK5SWS,"I was really surprised on the quality of this movies I believe they took the Re-mastered japanese DVD and add the spanish 5.1 audio wich was awesome for the old 80's movies but the new one didn't have the image quality that should have for being a newer movie I have a 60"" LED TV and you CAN SEE the difference there! and the old movies were pretty good even when they are over 20 years old but the 2004 heaven chapter was a little bit dissappointing (Not the movie! the quality ok)and the spanish dub was not as good as the old ones but it was still ok, reason way is that you can hear they don't even care anymore they just have the original voice and people is suppoused to like it because they are the original actors but they don't act like they are the caracters, like they did before, pay attention on the screams and the way the say those awesome lines they are just reading them! not acting like they did 20 years ago Japanese audio for me on this one. Overall this set is a buy for a saint seiya fan all five movies are awesome.",1338249600,,1038,4.143564356435643
8425436,4,B004DK5SWS,"Ok, I used to be addicted to this show when I was growing up in Argentina. I loved it!!! My Mom would take my little sisters out so I could study...And the whole time she was gone I would watch this. I only got to see one movie in the cinema, but I had watched all the different chapters on TV. Sanctuary, Poseidon, Nord Gods.

So now... The story is the same as all, cloths haven't changed that much so it ROCKS!!!!!
