2961548,4,B000W4RQ2O,It was both informative and entertaining to understand the history of Super Chief. Unfortunately this was an era we will never see again unless it is operated as the US Orient Express.,1370390400,,184,4.78125
2961549,4,B000W4RQ2O,"I grew up in the 50's and still love seeing the trains I grew up with.  There is some wonderful color footage here of one of the great trains of the world.  Hard to imagine now, but the US lead the world in train travel then.  My only complaint about this feature is that it is too verbose:  endless comments from former execs, passengers, crew members.  Some are very interesting and pertinent, but it gets tiresome after the first 45 minutes.  Found myself fast-fwding through those after a while to get to the good stuff -- the fantastic archival footage.  Lots of coverage of the dining car services, but none on sleeping car services.",1369180800,,639,4.552631578947368

2961553,5,B000W4RQ2O,"This one was really good. Santa Fe was never ""my"" railroad, never really got into that one. However, the video covered a lot of the history of the Santa Fe with lots of vintage footage and commentary by ex-Santa Fe railroad workers. It was very good, and it definitely made an impression on me. I really enjoyed it.",1359849600,,315,4.448275862068965
2961554,3,B000W4RQ2O,"We wanted a DVD, but instead got a digital copy. We don't have any way to use this, so it was money wasted. That said, the content of the film (which we saw elsewhere) is wonderful. For anyone who loves the Santa Fe Railroad in its heyday, for railfans of 1930's-40's-50's passenger service, for those who want to know how to travel in high style in the mid-20th century, this is fascinating.",1356739200,,392,4.458333333333333
2961555,5,B000W4RQ2O,"No, I'm sorry, but Amtrak just don't cut the mustard. I'd always heard how good the Super Chief was and it pains me to see this rather abbreviated version of just how dedicated the people who worked on that line really were. We will never see the likes of that level of service ever again. We really have declined in this country.",1325980800,,330,4.338709677419355

8221284,5,B000W4RQ2O,Takes you back to a time in America that I never experienced. But you do get a very good idea of what riding the Super Chief was like. Well worth the time!,1478304000,,155,3.875

8221290,3,B000W4RQ2O,"I was 14 years old in 1959 when I stepped off Santa Fe's EL CAPITAN at the magnificent LAUPT to begin my new life in LA. I was greeted by my father then walked through a beautiful patio bursting with colorful flowers and tropical plants to the Fred Harvey coffee shop where my stepmother was having her Sunday morning coffee. I had already sampled delicious Fred Harvey meals in the Hi-Level dining car.

I enjoyed this fantasy trip on the Super Chief I never got a chance to ride, but I agree with M Fusco. This dvd features way too much talking and not enough action though I love the chef's comments which seem more spontaneous and real. I am taking a cue from M  and fast-forwarding through the comments.

The busy dvd cover with those UGLY freight diesels is also a turn-off because it lacks that famous Super Chief ""Style"".

I am also waiting for a cheaper copy of the Super Chief DVD produced by Sunday River.",1403568000,,916,4.434523809523809
8221291,5,B000W4RQ2O,"Enjoyed this film.  Sort of wish I had been born thirty years earlier, so I could have experienced the Super Chief in person.  The down side to that is, I would probably not be sitting here typing a review of same in 2014....

Recommended for any rail fan.",1398124800,,256,4.291666666666667
