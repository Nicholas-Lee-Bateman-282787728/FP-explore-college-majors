The performances at concerts and festivels are energetic. and makes me wish that I had gotten the oppurtunity to see the band perform live. The video gives you the oppurtunity to see rage against the machine in action doing what they do best which was peforming live.
The videos from their first two albums add a lot. With a lot of videos, your never got a change to see them on TV so it's a great chance to see their work with the visuals that the band added.",1021161600,,557,4.264150943396227
8231221,5,1573300497,"This video is probably one of the best live band videos your going to get.  It shows the intensity and energy of Rage Against the Machine on stage, and is a MUST buy for ALL rage fans.  I bought this cd in a store (Hot  Topic) along with the single ghost of tom joad, and I believe it was  cheaper, BUT if you can't find it anywhere.  Definitely get it.",949363200,2,353,3.9857142857142858
8231222,4,1573300497,"I love RATM. I was at the Irvine Meadows concert shown in this video - unfortunately, that one is the worst of the ones shown. It was a great show, but it's just poor quality. Part of that is because it's at night,  but it also seems kind of poor anyway. The other shows are pretty good, but  the video has flaws. The video collection is cool though, although the ones  from the first album are basically just Rage live, they're awesome.",944784000,,437,4.304878048780488
