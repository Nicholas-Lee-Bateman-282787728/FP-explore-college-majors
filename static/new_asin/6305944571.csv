7898682,4,6305944571,"One of my first purchases of Dvd, The sound quality is average, I play dvds through a decent hifi system and it just fails to reach top quality of live performances, Marti does his best but its a shame the audience make too much noise... but the dvd has all there top hits, love is all around .. etc....  If you like Wet wet wet then well worth buying.....lots of songs to listen to on a quiet night in with the misses!",1016668800,,419,4.109756097560975
