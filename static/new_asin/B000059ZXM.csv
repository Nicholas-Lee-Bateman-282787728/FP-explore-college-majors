8235206,3,B000059ZXM,"I prefer films that are not good and do not pretend to be anything else, than many overblown pretentious productions financed by big companies that try to pass for more than what they really are: little bad motion pictures in disguise, behind big names, expensive sets, costumes and make-up. ""Operation Bikini"" does not pretend to be anything else than a routine, low-budget war programmer made by American International Pictures, with some actors who once were in better vehicles (Scott Brady, Tab Hunter, Gary Crosby), new talent used in AIP productions that would later fare better in ""beach party"" movies (Frankie Avalon, Jody McCrea), reliable professionals as Michael Dante and even Jim Backus, plus an Hungarian ""Miss Whatever"" (Eva Six, playing a Japanese woman) and a bunch of California blondes to spice things up a bit, and a map of Mexico passing for some location on the Asian Pacific. Do not expect much from this, it is certainly not good, so just take it for what it is. Now, it sure did help to have a film editor as director, for Anthony Carras really did wonders combining the scenes he shot with stock footage of war action. Proceed at your own risk, but believe me: there are really worst things than this pretending to be ""masterpieces"". 2.5/5",1492041600,,1265,4.861111111111111

8235208,2,B000059ZXM,"Strange, uneven film... like a BEACH PARTY prequel disguised as a low-budget war film that somehow can mention BOTH the atomic testing at Bikini Atoll AND talk about (and show) fun-loving pretty girls wearing the swimwear named after it. Weird.",1464739200,2,244,5.125

8235211,3,B000059ZXM,"Laughed a lot. Yes, unintentional humor.  I should probably give it two stars, but we watched it to the end...  If you appreciate the campy style of the 60s and can put up with the mandatory Frankie Avalon music bits (which are so out of place and poorly screened that you will roll your eyes), and can endure a rather wooden script and a goofy love scene between Tab Hunter and Eva Six, and the military faux pas, then you might like this movie...  Look, the stuff that seems bad that I mentioned actually makes it more entertaining.  :o)",1434585600,,539,4.414141414141414
