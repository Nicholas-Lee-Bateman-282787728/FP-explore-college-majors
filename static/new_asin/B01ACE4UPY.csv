7598008,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Sad because his friend, a doctor accentually due to arrogance ended his chance of life.",1457308800,,87,4.866666666666666
7598009,4,B01ACE4UPY,I thought it was a very well done examination of President Garfield's life and legacy.,1456012800,,86,4.8
7598010,2,B01ACE4UPY,"This documentary isn't up to American Experience's normally excellent standards. There is a substantial amount of overwrought dramatization, which is based on a largely fictionalized screenplay. The acting is dreadful (the actor playing Garfield as Shakespeare would have written him is particularly irritating) and not believable for one second. Making matters worse is a sloppy approach to approximating the dialogue of the era; for example, a man asks Garfield if he likes his new ""digs"" in the White House, a term that was coined a decade after Garfield's passing. How many seconds would that have taken to check?",1455494400,2,617,5.3061224489795915
7598011,5,B01ACE4UPY,"I didn't know much about Garfield before I watched this American Experience program.  I'm astonished by the potential greatness of this man and angered by Dr. Bliss.  To think how history would've changed if Bliss hadn't been in charge, if he had practiced hygiene, Garfield would probably have lived. By the end of the program there were tears in my eyes -- what a waste of a brilliant man, what a needless, stupid waste of a life.  Astonishingly good program.",1454457600,17,461,4.7375
7598012,5,B01ACE4UPY,"This experience brought out the best & worst in people. And that Dr Bliss, wtf???!! As for this episode its an excellent production.",1513555200,,132,4.782608695652174
7598013,5,B01ACE4UPY,This is a look back on history of the life and death of a president.  After watching this it makes you think of houw history could of been changed if this preventable death did not happen.  It was well presented and worth watching,1511481600,,230,4.325581395348837
7598014,5,B01ACE4UPY,Great documentary. I learned so much from it. He would have been a great president.,1510444800,,83,4.6
7598015,5,B01ACE4UPY,I didn't learn about President Garfield. No one talks about him. I was blown away to know how great and compassionate he was as President. A man of integrity. People loved him and more gathered at his funeral than Lincoln's. I only wish he was blessed with good health and finished his term. He could have changed our society. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to watch this.,1508803200,,377,4.478260869565218
7598016,5,B01ACE4UPY,"The power of one is what I am left with after viewing this.  From breaking the stalemate at convention to his Mother, to Charles Guiteau and each of the doctors.  One of my favorite American Experiences!",1503532800,,203,4.611111111111111

7598018,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Among dramatical re-enactments of historical figures, this is one of the best I have seen.  These actors all did a fantastic job.  Outstanding historical production, narration, directing.  Much appreciated.",1501545600,,206,6.0344827586206895
7598019,5,B01ACE4UPY,"I will admit I watched this by chance that I may find it interesting. I was willing to give it a try. However, having watched it I have a new found appreciation for President Garfield's view for America (not to mention modern medicine!!). I highly recommend this. You will be shocked at what you didn't know!",1500163200,,308,4.517857142857143
7598020,5,B01ACE4UPY,Truly a great documentary,1499990400,,25,5.5
7598021,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Clearly, this man could have been a Great President.",1497744000,,52,4.888888888888889
7598022,5,B01ACE4UPY,"A President and a man whose story deserves to be told and this documentary does it in a compelling way. He tried to make the country more equal and a better place for more people. He was brought down by the ignorance of religion, the hubris of an incompetent doctor and the stain of violence that haunts our country's political history.",1497571200,,336,4.524590163934426
7598023,5,B01ACE4UPY,"A massively good and important story that had nearly fallen by the wayside of American history. All too often, all those bearded late 19th Century presidents just start to seem the same in what feels like a presidential dead-zone between Lincoln and Teddy Rosevelt: boring, corrupt, overfed Victorians. This film makes the argument that with Garfield died a dream for a different, better path through the industrial revolution--and at least implies that perhaps he, rather than Lincoln, was the last casualty of the Civil War.",1495411200,,526,5.2
7598024,5,B01ACE4UPY,"I knew little about President Garfield.  This DVD was concise, and yet very informative and I strongly recommend it if you are trying to learn a little about each president.  This DVD was very well done--parts that were dramatized were well acted.  I learned a lot about the man, himself and now, I'd be very interested to read a full biography of him.",1494288000,,352,4.555555555555555
7598025,5,B01ACE4UPY,This was detail loaded and very informative. I had no idea about these facts. We all know about Lincoln and Kennedy. We don't hear much about the details of this story. Well done.,1494115200,,179,4.454545454545454
7598026,5,B01ACE4UPY,Very interesting film. I got it at our local library because I did not know anything about the subject. Good use of two hours. The PBS American Experience films are usually pretty good. Ask your local library to order copy of this if you would like to watch it.,1487289600,,261,4.346938775510204

7598030,5,B01ACE4UPY,"This documentary is a very good overview of the James Garfield ascension to the presidency of the United States and his assassination.  It also helps orient students of history to the transformation between Reconstruction and the Gilded age in the United States by connecting grand ideas to individuals.  The documentary is very well thought out and laid out in a tight narrative.  I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the United States, especially in the 19th century.",1486598400,,490,5.1

7598037,3,B01ACE4UPY,"I thought the movie was well produced and had credible acting. My main issue with the film was the total omission of the fact that President Garfield was a Lay Minister in the Disciples of Christ church.  The movie portrayed his wife Lucretia as extremely devout, but little if any was mentioned about the impact of the faith in James' life. Instead what was covered was information about his extra-marital affair. He was also described as having a gentle and kind spirit.  Could it be that his beliefs influenced him and helped shape his character?  You wouldn't know from this movie.",1485561600,,585,4.772277227722772

7598041,5,B01ACE4UPY,Fascinating. I'd recommend following up with Candice Miller's biography.,1485302400,,72,7.111111111111111

7598048,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Last night I watched this on Amazon. American Experience is such an eye opening PBS series. I didn't know much about President Garfield before seeing this. I particularly like how he said publicly to African Americans: ""I tell you now, in the closing days of this campaign, I would rather be with you and defeated than against you and victorious.""",1484784000,,347,4.8
7598049,5,B01ACE4UPY,"This story is about a man who became president ,he might have done great things,but he was shot early in his admin. And his doctor who he trusted let him down.",1484784000,,159,4.161290322580645

7598059,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Very well done, a mix of reenactments and documentary.  I was not aware how loved and charismatic James Garfield was, so glad this did him justice. Interesting how medicine was so wrong yet arrogant at the same time.  What a shame that this young and hopeful President was assassinated before making a difference.",1483747200,,313,4.886792452830188
7598060,4,B01ACE4UPY,"The story of President Garfield is one that I had never heard before.  This DVD is done very well, and the whole story is extremely interesting if you are interested in American history at all.  The more I learn about our country's history, the more I understand that people don't really change much.  It's well worth the time to be more informed.",1483747200,,347,4.564516129032258

7598071,4,B01ACE4UPY,It was very interesting. We knew very little about President Garfield and his assassination.  The political intrigue just goes on and on  in this country election after election. There are always those who want to do good for the citizens of this country and then there are the power grabbers who only think of what they can get from it.  Even the doctor that held the president's life in his hands. Garfield's plans for this country would have made the years after the Civil War much better for it's citizens and the newly freed slaves. What a shame and waste of the life of a good man.,1482883200,,587,4.4672897196261685

7598080,5,B01ACE4UPY,There was a time when Americans truly loved their president. This documentary is proof. Candice Millard assists in painting a picture of a man who passionately cared for each and every citizen.

I love biographies and biopics and this movie did not disappoint.

I did not realize what a great president he was - albeit for a short time - and what a great American story his rise to such an exalted political status revealed. I highly recommend this program to anyone interested in political life in early America.",1478304000,,616,4.923076923076923

His life story reflects all the ups and downs of life and his determination to excel and be a success.  Because I never leaned about him in any of the history classes of my education is a sad reflection on our educational system.  Possibly because his life and term as President were cut short by an assassins bullet, he never achieved the fame of Abraham Lincoln.

Unfortunately, President Garfield had the misfortune of only being in office for just over 200 days, so there is not much that the history books can tell up, except that he was assassinated, and the identity of his assassin.  This video gives us a much more in depth look at the man and at the times.  It shows us that even today we don't hold a monopoly on political corruption.  It also gives us a look at the very sad state of affairs of the practice of medicine in 1881.  Garfield possibly could have survived if not for the incompetent arrogance of his doctor.  As you get through the story you begin to wonder how much different things could have been today if he had been able to complete his term in office.  It did appear that Garfield had many ideas that would have catapulted the country from the 1880's into the 20th Century.  But alas, an assassins bullet, and a bad doctor kept all that from being realized.  This docudrama is well worth the time for a viewing.  If you are interested in the history of the country, the presidency and the presidents, then this is a must see to fill in the gaps.",1474848000,8,1212,4.323008849557522

The only talk of his name is of his assassination, but not of his truly amazing story. He is an example of the true American dream. The documentary displays his life from his poverty stricken childhoold, to making his way in college (doubling as a Janitor), becoming a Professor, Commanding troops in the Civil War as General, his early political career and his rise to become President. Looking back on my own learning I cannot see for the life of me why he is skipped in history.

However, this documentary will show why he SHOULD NOT be skipped in history class. It is wonderfully scripted, follows a easy timeline and depicts what it was like in America during the time of James Garfield.",1474416000,5,807,4.56551724137931

Garfield  started out life poor but his intelligence help launch him into the field of politics where he was a 'standout'. We'll never know his full capabilities but in my heart he would have been a great president. Such an incredible life cut short by an insane gunman and the doctors who thought they were saving their president with their germ ridden fingers and tools and possibly the bullet itself helped manifest the sepsis. A tragically horrible way to die which in our day he would have survived. Yes antiseptic had been invented but Garfield's doctor didn't believe in it just yet.

7598233,5,B01ACE4UPY,Very interesting part of history. My experience with Garfield was that he wasn't anything to talk about. Maybe because he was so determined to make sure Afro Americans would have all their rights and he wasn't doing it to get their votes. It seems after his death all attempts was made to forget him as the country moved towards a more discriminatory society. It sure was an eye opener for me.,1473638400,,393,4.549295774647887

7598243,4,B01ACE4UPY,"If you are asked to name the four Presidents who were assassinated while in office, most people will only remember two. Very few will remember all four. President Garfield isn't remembered at all by history although he was a very talented and intelligent man. The murder of Garfield is a story of a religious patronage seeker who was mentally disturbed, but it is more about the doctors who treated him and how for months Garfield suffered from their ignorance and jealousies. In the end, it was the doctors who killed him! If you need to know more about the life of President Garfield read Candice Millard's book ""Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and of the Murder"".

7598269,4,B01ACE4UPY,"I knew nothing about the second president ever to have been assassinated, but this excellent episode of The American Experience brought him alive for me.

Almost two decades had elapsed since Lincoln was fatally shot, but no one was protecting the 20th president as he strode through a train station in 1881, the day he was shot by a seemingly schizophrenic loner, Charles Guiteau. (People had still believed, in what seems so naive today, that if the people didn't like a politician, they could simply vote him out of office.)

Garfield grew up poor in Ohio, but had a lot of determination to better himself, starting out as a janitor at an educational institution that subsequently appointed him instructor of English, math, and ancient languages.

""He made up his mind he was going to do better than other students,"" we're told. ""He got to the point he was smarter than most of his teachers.""

This episode discusses Garfield's experience as a Union general during the Civil War, as well as the troubled early years of his marriage to Lucretia, an intellectual young classmate. Garfield is described as having been ""selfish"" earlier in his life, and he at one point had an affair with a woman in New York. However, Lucretia seemingly approached this fact with the utmost of maturity and it seems the breach of trust ended up solidifying their union.

Garfield's attacker is played well by Will Janowitz. It seems the highly misguided Guiteau had had a very hard life; his father had beaten him for stuttering and it seems the awkward young man never really fit in. He wound up drifting from one boardinghouse after another when the rent was due. Guiteau hoped his efforts to help Garfield's presidential bid would lead to an appointment as consul to France. And when that didn't happen, it seemed the unprotected Garfield's fate was sealed.

""He has proved a traitor to the men that made him,"" Guiteau reasoned. ""This is not a murder; this is a necessity.""

This episode does a good job of showing how the state of medicine at the time, as well as rivalry among doctors, played a significant role in Garfield's inability to heal. And who knew that Alexander Graham Bell developed the first metal detector in response to this shooting? (Garfield had suffered horribly during abortive attempts to locate the bullet that had penetrated his back.)

Garfield, seemingly so forgotten today, was beloved by the people of his time. While the dying, bedridden president rode a railroad to the Jersey Shore where his devoted wife waited, citizens threw straw on the train tracks to ease his journey.

Back in the 19th century, it didn't seem to matter if a criminal defendant was seemingly ""profoundly mentally ill."" Guiteau's trial lasted more than 70 days; he was convicted in little over an hour and died on the gallows.",1473206400,4,2816,4.85

Mr. Garfield seems, from history, to have been a man of true character and convictions with a commitment to not follow the machine politics of his own party.  In parallel to the historical tale of his short presidency is interwoven the tragic tale of his assassin as well as the great love story of James and Lucretia Garfield.

7598330,5,B01ACE4UPY,"I liked the movie.  It was well played and I learned a lot.  Sad the way the doctor was botching the job of caring for the injured President only trying to make a name for himself.  It must have been a scary situation with the President unable to do his job and the vice president refusing to take responsibility.  I think Arthur realized he wasn't equipped for it, but when he did take office he refused to be Conklin's patsy.  That much is to his credit.  I thought the film was well played and the details matched  real life history.",1471824000,,536,4.3

7598333,5,B01ACE4UPY,"Excellent, gripping drama/documentary of Garfield's assassination.  He was a good man and a good candidate for President.  He hung on to life for a long time, and maybe he would have lived had the doctor/s at the time practiced sanitary methods and listened to others who disagreed with the treatment he was receiving.  His assassin, interestingly enough, worked for Garfield's campaign.  When turned down by Garfield for a position in Paris he wanted, he decided to kill the President.  An interesting chapter of history, it's good that this story got a good telling and is not forgotten.",1471824000,,589,5.030927835051546

I never read it. I now regret not doing so. This was one of the most wonderful movies and surprises of my lifetime--sounds like I'm exaggerating but I am not. I just happened to scroll across the movie lists while looking on Prime Video and was drawn to watching it.. What a great thing and representation of a man, who if he had lived, would have undoubtedly changed the course of our government. Highly recommended!",1471824000,2,596,4.579439252336448

Enjoyed this history lesson and story very much and the real photos and newspaper articles were interesting too.  What a good man and good president.  He really could have helped the US advance to equality if he had more time.  So awful how the medical people probably caused his death more so than the bullet.,1471737600,,405,4.911764705882353

7598346,5,B01ACE4UPY,"AE has excellent and informative programming.  This one on Pres. Garfield was especially interesting, as he's often neglected as an in-between president with Reconstruction and turn of the 20th century, and endeavored to avoid cronyism.  His administration was cut short, so who knows how he would've shaped history.  As we prepare to elect our 45th president the AE series helps us focus on our core values and the stuff of what a good president is made.  While the world is too dangerous and the stakes too high these days, it would be interesting to live at a time when the president was more accessible...and likely more accountable too!  Accountability is needed more than ever to keep those in leadership above board and on task.",1471651200,,735,4.895161290322581

7598348,5,B01ACE4UPY,"I love history!  I did not realize how little I knew about the assassination of this president.  Jus the fact that the president was never even taken to the hospital, was weird enough.  But the fact his treatment was left to one doctor.  Leaves one to speculate how important or unimportant the office of president was.  Maybe that was due to the Grant presidency with all its scandal ridden administration.

7598356,5,B01ACE4UPY,SO interesting! I never knew so much about our 20th president until this docu-movie. PBS did a great job of showing the events unfold and at the same time explaining the story behind each character to help the audience understand why they acted the way they did. It doesn't take away from the overall tragedy from losing a President who had so much potential and so little time to enact on it. Great and informative. Must-watch!,1471478400,,428,4.644736842105263

This documentary could not have been better and actually inspired me to do some research on America's more vague and forgotten presidents.  I hope PBS and other such entities continue to make such great documentaries on these forgotten presidents and events of the past.

On an eerie note, there appear to be several correlations with the current election and the one Garfield won.  I only wish more politicians would grow and maintain such epic facial hair because it makes it so much easier to distinguish between people.",1470960000,,659,5.247619047619048

7598406,5,B01ACE4UPY,"This is a dramatized documentary of the 20th U.S. President, James Garfield - his history is incredibly interesting.  Who knew?!?  Garfield is little-remembered other than for his assassination.  He was a good man and seemingly on track for being one of our more effective and respected presidents. Only four months into his presidency, however, he was shot down by a mentally ill disgruntled former supporter.  Interestingly, though, he was arguably killed by the doctor that attended his wounds.  Garfield was hit by two shots; one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen.  Historians and medical experts believe Garfield would have survived his wounds but for his medical treatment, which included starving him and causing a massive infection that was a significant factor in Garfield's demise.  The drama surrounding all of this, including defying the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling and the Stalwarts.  Bottomline, the film is a compelling history lesson - definitely worth watching.",1470787200,,1065,5.335329341317365

Perhaps our nations first tragic loss that affected so many American's, rich or poor, black or white. Sorrow for what could have been is truly color blind.

A crazy person, conveniently, murders a political figure the rich and powerful do not particularly like.  Single handedly?  No.  Notice, Chester Arthur, VP to Garfield, was in Conkling's pocket; probably the way he got VP.  Guiteau, the assassin, was waiting inside the train station when Garfield arrived to travel to be with his wife, the First Lady, away at a summer resort of sorts.  How did Guiteau know he would be traveling that train?  Never even brought out in the movie.  Chester Arthur dodging the press, and every one, after the incident, drinking.  Had to think it over, how Conkling had used him; how he had been a fool and loose lipped to Conkling, etc., etc.  Garfield upon taking office refused to be pushed around by Conkling and Conkling told him he would pay for it.  Conkling manipulated the pawn, Guiteau.  When will the truth of their games be revealed in the media.  Who funded this?  American Experience or American Slant, American Coverup, please.

President Garfield would of lived with the same wounds if it happened today. A truly gifted politician was cut down in his prime before his impact could be felt in the Nation. A forgotten time and Presidents. I felt as if the movie did not know if it was a documentary or a bad movie. that is why I gave it 2 stars.

Don't recall if they ever mention his doctor's first name was really Doctor. And Doctor seemed to be a borderline quack, even given some of the medical ignorance of the day. Curious how he managed to not be run out of Dodge long before this happened. They gloss over some of the misery of Garfield's final days and also some of his relatively high functioning at times.

Because He sent an assassin to kill every president who stood against them. I was moved to tears to know that we will never again see someone of such incorruptable carachter lead our great nation.

Anyone can go as far as their dreams take them, regardless of race, creed, or color.  That is what he believed as he himself had come from very humble beginnings.  He died after only 200 days in office.  A tragedy that would repeat itself all too often in American politics.",1469491200,5,526,4.531914893617022

The reality of the story will surprise modern day citizens as to the true machinations of our political system. The irony of the political circumstances  almost exactly mirror those of 2016.

This is, above all though, a story of a sad chapter in our history. There is ample blame for the death of a popular President, both criminally and medically. Had President Garfield suffered the same gunshot wounds in 2016, he likely would have easily survived the trauma. Had he survived in his day, the changes he might have wrought would no doubt live to affect our lives today.

As I watched this very fine documentary, I was so impressed with what a wonderful person this man was and what a honorable president he would have made if he had been able to continue in office.  His struggle to overcome a childhood of extreme poverty,  his compassion for the black slaves he encountered during his military career in the Civil War and his dream to create opportunities for  poorer people in society was truly impressive.  I found myself wishing we had someone in office like this man, today.  I was very touched by the story of his life and his courage and fortitude after he was shot and then given appallingly poor medical treatment that ended up costing him his life.  This is a truly amazing story and one that everyone would benefit from watching.

7598751,5,B01ACE4UPY,">>spoiler alert<<  Very informative.  Previously the only thing I knew about President James Garfield was that he was shot soon after taking office and never had a chance to make an impact on the nation.  In this documentary, we are given a lot of background on Garfield's life, education, marriage and military and political career.  I never knew that Charles Guiteau had been a political worker known by Garfield and his staff.  Also, I had never before known of the political manipulations behind the scenes in the late 1800's, particularly those of Vice President Chester A. Arthur and Senator Roscoe Conkling.",1468627200,,614,5.03960396039604

7598768,5,B01ACE4UPY,"In the over two hundred year long history of the American presidency, only four Presidents have died as a result of an assassin's bullet.  Although there is perhaps an excess of documentaries on the Lincoln and JFK ones, Garfield and McKinley are rarely mentioned.  This documentary/film brings Garfield and his times to life.  It covers his rise from poverty and obscurity on the frontier to his tenure as a college professor.  It shows how his military service during the Civil War affected his views on both warfare and slavery.  Having only served six months in office, we'll never know for certain what kind of President he would have made.  But, one can surmise, based off the manner in which he stood up to party bosses like Roscoe Conkling, he would have made a fairly effective one.

The disappointed and insane office seeker, who shot the President, Charles Guiteau, is discussed with a fair amount of depth.  As is how 19th century Americans viewed extreme mental illness.  Yet, it wasn't just the madman's bullet that killed the President, so much as the inept and unsanitary medicine of the time.

For an interesting and highly entertaining look at a chapter in U.S. history often treated as a mere footnote I strongly recommend this docudrama.",1468022400,,1257,4.886792452830188
7598769,5,B01ACE4UPY,"This was a very good documentary. I didn't know much about President Garfield so I learned a lot.  Its just sad that his doctor was who it was. Had he had a different one, perhaps he could have survived.",1468022400,,203,4.205128205128205

7598778,5,B01ACE4UPY,"The PBS series ""American Experience"" has a well known reputation for outstanding programs looking at poignant and interesting moments in the history of this country of ours and telling the story behind those events. Not every episode has been a winner but when they make a good episode it is outstanding. ""Murder Of A President"" is one of those outstanding ones. It looks at the life and death of our 20th president, James Garfield. His death is the main point to this documentary. That is because he would be our second president in the history of this country to be assassinated. He wouldn't die right away however. He was elected President in 1880 and was sworn in on March 4th 1881. He had all the makings of becoming a great president. He wasn't looking to become president but circumstances would lead him to the office. But it did look like his election as President was a popular choice among Americans. He was starting to put into effect the direction he was hoping to lead the country towards. Until one day in early July 1881 he was shot by a disgruntled man who felt he played an important part in Garfield's election and thought deserving of a government position as thanks for his help. When he didn't receive such a position he took his revenge by shooting Garfield.

Garfield was hit twice but neither of the bullets he was hit with were fatale right away. In fact he might have the survived the assassination attempt if he had better medical attention to his wounds and that is where the story becomes interesting. I won't go into details here what happens. You have to watch this for yourself and see what takes place. You may well find you will be outraged as I was to see just how the President's medical treatment was so shoddy. He would live for almost another three months before he would succumb to his injuries. But to see how needless it all was shows this was one of the greatest tragedies the United States ever faced.

The story looks at the entire life of Garfield not just his death from his days as a youth to being a scholar to being a Civil War Officer for the North to his career in politics. To watch this documentary is to see the possibilities of what Garfield could have done for the nation if he had been given the chance. Alas he wasn't given that chance and what could have been done during his administration can only be speculation. This is a moment in U.S. history that extremely few Americans know about. What I would come to learn of Garfield's life and death would come from this DVD. Like a few Americans I suspect were aware he was one of only four U.S. Presidents to be killed in office. But beyond that not much else is known about this former President. This is something history classes don't teach about. The program itself is well done I feel. The production is told in a combination of still photographs and letters written by important people who are pertinent to the events of what occurred to actors hired to recreate important moments during Garfield's time as President to his assassination to his medical treatment and finally to his death. In between there are history scholars who talk about what and why events happened and this all works in keeping this presentation interesting and informative. If you are a history nerd like me you will want to watch this. But even if you are an American that finds history boring you need to watch this and learn about one of the greatest tragedies that has occurred in this country that most Americans are unfamiliar with.",1462147200,12,3527,4.579113924050633
