6689901,4,B00NYDFHAI,"Having watched most of those live on tv back when, I jumped immediately at the opportunity to have everything on one dvd box set and avoiding the transfer to digital of my vhs tapes. Unfortunately the job was not completed the way it could have been. I think the biggest regret here is that it's missing all the speeches/interviews. Livewire had an interview, VMA 95 had the 'video vanguard award' acceptance speech and interview on the red carpet, RnR hall of fame had an acceptance speech, Colbert had an interview. None of that is included here, it's straight out performances. It's also missing bits here and there from mtv news that included interviews and tidbits on the road (an interview at LAX on the verge of the start of monster tour, report of monster tour from Spain, report from Roskilde festival which also included an incomplete performance of Kenneth, etc).

As for Dallas '95 all that was recorded and broadcasted were the first three songs (as it's common practice for press outlets at all concerts). That was part of a segment called '3 from 1' and R.E.M. were the first to be live, while usually it was 3 videoclips from the same artist. Speaking of videoclips whoever is demanding videoclips on this set didn't understand what this release is about. This is material that was produced and owned by mtv networks. Promotional videoclips, although shown on mtv, are not mtv property. This is true for any artist. The record label owns the rights for videoclips, which in the case of REM have been collected already on home video (see this film is on, parallel, best of etc). This set is also missing a show called rockumentary which was edited in two different versions by mtv, one for the green world tour and again in 98. I have yet to watch the 'REM by MTV' documentary which claims to collect some of the missing bits, but given the general feedback that states the doc is missing input from the band itself, I don't have my hopes high. I may update my thoughts after I watch it.

Another huge disappointment for me is that the outtakes are listed separately. It's great that they dug up to find what was not necessarily broadcasted (although mtv Europe often showed more than mtv USA, so some of those outtakes were actually broadcasted on mtv in Europe) but the songs should have been reinstated in the original order of the setlist. This way I'm forced to watch two truncated shows while I could watch a full show in the setlist order it was conceived. The 'play all' features in this case doesn't help. Unless somebody discovers a way or an easter egg, in such case please do tell me. On a side note Cologne 2001 is missing 'The great beyond' and 'Daysleeper' even in the outtakes.

In conclusion I'm glad I bought it because it is a great collection of live performances and concerts from the band, but it is also a missed opportunity of having a complete archive of mtv material. I guess I can't throw away the vhs tapes yet. The audio quality is superb, the video quality is better than any professional vhs transfer (or beta transfer for that matter, which is probably what was used here).

UPDATE Dec, 21st 2014
I finally watched the documentary REM by MTv. Most of the missing bits and interviews we have all been complaining about are included here. So it's not true that REM themselves are not part of documentary. This is mostly made of the material from ""Rockumentary"". The interviews are edited to fit the doc but the important parts are there: Colbert, Stewart, LAX, RnR Hall of fame induction, VMA 95 speech and carpet. The VMA 93 speech appears in full in the deleted scenes.",1417910400,4,3616,4.636505460218409
6689902,5,B00NYDFHAI,"My only gripes are a shortage of Berry-era performances, and that the REM By MTV piece ends a little abruptly. Would have been nice to have a little perspective regarding the band's dissolution. Otherwise, this is awesome.",1417564800,,222,5.027027027027027
6689903,4,B00NYDFHAI,Gave it as a gift.  Came two days late.  My son wanted it and likes it.  All is good.,1417392000,,85,3.3684210526315788
6689904,5,B00NYDFHAI,"Technically I would give this 4.5 stars, because it's not perfect, but fans of REMespecially those who grew up with the band along with MTVwill find this one of the best career retrospectives they've yet released. The big selling point here is ""REM by MTV"" (disc 6 in this package), an all-new documentary assembled from the myriad interviews and performance clips that MTV collected in its archives over the years. At 1 hour and 46 minutes, it really is a thing of wonder: meticulously crafted from beginning to end, not skipping over any of the band's essential history, and done so with clips that were mostly concurrent with each era so that you get to see the band evolve and change over time, sometimes making comments that are absolutely mindblowing in retrospect (such as pre-superstar Michael saying that he could envision making a song that was perfect for radio but not willing to do it yet because radio didn't yet deserve him).

Elsewhere on the box you get definitive presentations of shows such as Unplugged and VH1 Storytellers, as well as a few full live sets and highlights from such events as the 2007 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction and the VMAs in 1993 and 1995. While I agree it is frustrating that full presentations of these events are not included (in particular, seeing the full Induction complete with speech and acceptance), the focus is on the music and you get lots of it. Many live REM performances have been released over the years, and these are mostly as good if not better than those.

The audio/video presentation is great, and about as good as one might expect for archival material. It is not HD but it never feels low-res or shows pixilation or compression artifacts the way that older DVDs might these days.

Don't worry that official promo videos or live performance shows not produced by MTV/Viacom aren't here. REM have been very generous in the category of video product over the years and this box beautifully complements such releases as Tourfilm, Parallel, and In Time. It's not meant to be a replacement for any of those.",1417392000,11,2074,4.7555555555555555
6689905,5,B00NYDFHAI,"Some really good things in here, but it's certainly not an exhaustive collection. 14 hours seems like it's a lot, but it's really just a tiny glimpse of their outstanding 31-year career.

However, I will note one huge error in my collection (which was pre-ordered through the fan club and delivered from the UK). On my collection, disc 2 ends after the 1993 video music awards and is missing the following:

Video Music Awards 1995
European Music Awards 1998
European Music Awards 2001
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction 2007
The Colbert Report

Edit: Using the ""PLAY ALL"" feature all of the tracks do indeed play. The tracks listed above are, however, missing from the track listing that shows on-screen when I play the disc.",1417305600,3,728,4.761904761904762
6689906,3,B00NYDFHAI,"My husband got me this as a gift so I shouldn't complain but...in 2014 they couldn't make this HD quality?!

Of course the songs are all good (quite a few repeats) but unfortunately it was limited to MTV's inventory and not even the real videos that were shown on MTV.

This is a nice compilation but NOT exhaustive by any means.",1417132800,,329,4.377049180327869
6689907,3,B00NYDFHAI,"Although this collection can be described, at the very least, ""Monolithic"", the dearth of Bill Berry era live material can only be considered ""Disappointing"" since that will always be the Golden Era to most fans.  Seeing as this material was mostly culled from the MTV vaults, we do not get the 1984 Reckoning Tour show at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ which not only aired on MTV, but the band were introduced to the stage by part-time MTV personality Karla DeVito.  Of course you can find the video posted, but it would have been nice to see a remastered version.  There's also the Rockpalast performance from the 1985 Fables tour that featured some crazy covers and at least two unreleased (at the time) songs...I'm pretty sure they would have had to secure the rights to include it, but I'm pretty sure REM/Warner/Rhino could have dug the money out of their couches...There's even crappy footage from the Work Tour that I would have traded for any of the post-2000 shows.  I will probably eventually pick this up, but I'm not rushing out to get it.",1416960000,10,1057,4.697297297297298
6689908,4,B00NYDFHAI,"Virtually every performance R.E.M. did on a Viacom network, from an early appearance on Nickelodeon's ""Livewire"" to ""MTV Unplugged"" (twice!) to ""The Colbert Report"" during the final 2008 tour. The major gripe here is that several appearances are truncated - the ""Livewire"" footage leaves out the band's interview, and the ""The Cutting Edge"" excerpt is the cobbled-together interview/performance clip format that actually aired, rather than including all of the actual performance footage (which is available elsewhere).

It also includes a full-length documentary about the band's history, built from interviews at various stages of the band's history, supplemented with TV footage and talking heads from basically everyone EXCEPT the band themselves.  (Another thing that isn't on here - non-performance footage like interviews, Michael Stipe hosting ""120 Minutes"", etc.)

It does NOT, however, include R.E.M.'s actual music videos. Those aren't all available on one DVD yet.

There's a whole lot to love here, especially for die-hard fans who can finally have all this stuff in one place - but including all the footage (and the videos!) would take it to ""essential"" status.",1416787200,35,1176,5.516666666666667
6689909,5,B00NYDFHAI,"Well this answers my question of ""Where's the DVD"" that I asked via my review here after I bought the Unplugged CD set earlier this year.  I am sure there will be many longer reviews gushing in more detail than mine but let me sum this fabulous set by saying this: this is 14+ hours of pure joy.  There.  Enough said.  This set is a must have for anyone who is a new fan, a casual fan or a diehard fan (like myself) of REM.  These men were visionaries and they are all fantastic human beings.

I didn't have cable TV back when the majority of this was broadcast so there is a lot of material here that is new to me which makes it even more exciting to me.

I love the packaging for this set too!  I truly am looking forward to seeing what else is produced from the band's vaults in the future.  Thank you guys!

(A minor picking point though is the 2001 Unplugged show doesn't actually show ALL 'outtakes'. I have a bootleg DVD that includes lots of banter in between songs.  The exclusion of that from this set doesn't hurt it per se, but it would have been more fun if it was included too.)

I'd still like to see a collection of every music video on one release, a DVD of their last concert together AND a compilation of all the promo documentaries they did for Out of Time, Automatic, etc.

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE SEEING ANYTHING PAST THE 1993 VMAs click that tiny little arrow right in front of the ""P"" for ""Play Now"" and it will advance the menu.  I had trouble with that one too.",1416787200,10,1503,4.155709342560554

I am yet to make enquiries regarding this. So its a bit disappointing when such things happen.
Otherwise the Box set is great for any REM fan.  as usual REM produce great content.

Because there is so much in this set its not that surprising the same songs do get played. Which can get a little frustrating.

After some investigationg all the content is there.

6689918,1,B00NYDFHAI,"This box set should be receiving a 5-Star review from me right now. As a fan of REM I have been waiting forever for a proper career spanning documentary, and the one included in this set is exactly that. A documentary which covers every phase of the bands career, editing together footage from live concerts, TV shows, interviews, and music videos. The documentary called REM by MTV is without question the gem of this box set. The live shows included on discs 1-5 are great but the star attraction is the documentary. The documentary is so well made in fact that I wish that Rhino/Warner Bros. would release it separably from this box set. So why is the rating so low? The answer is that unfortunately, there appears to be a manufacture problem. I bought this set two times in a row trying to get a copy that would play all the way through properly. No such luck. Disc #6 which is the disc featuring the documentary failed to play properly every time. Both times Disc #6 was played on multiple DVD players and Blu-Ray/DVD players and failed. Stopping at the same point in the feature right during the transition from Automatic for the People into Monster. It would just freeze up and would not play that section of the doc. Major bummer. The rating is for poor performance quality and not for content which from what I'v seen is stellar.",1428624000,4,1338,4.556016597510373

I love all the stuff from Up but disc 5 is all 2008 stuff and all basically the same show 3 times over.  The documentary is cool but there aren't any new interviews!  I was disappointed by that.

8681119,4,B00NYDFHAI,"This box set contains a lot of material, a lot of shows, concerts, TV appearances, outtakes, etc. If you love R.E.M. this is really the stuff for you. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is follows: I think overall arrangement was good except that as you move from disc to disc it does feel a bit repetitious. That's because most of the performances contain the same songs. However, each disc does also contains extra other songs which are not on the previous disc. I am just surprised that some of their greates hits are not included here. Tons of concerts and live stage performances and there is no ""Stand"". There is no ""Shiny Happy People"". There is no ""Bang and Blame"", and there is no Nightswimming (there are a few Drive, What's the Frequency Kenneth?""). I am not sure if the band never performed these songs in their concerts or this particular box set doesn't happen to contain those performances?  So I took off one star because of those missing songs. And there are occassional concerts where the camera work leaves much to be desired for. Especially on  the 4th disc (I think) when the band is performing in the rain, the camera constantly goes out of focus. Sometimes even when the object is in the middle of the frame, it goes blurry and out of focus. This happens quite a bit throughout the performance. It almost made me think that the cameraman was not a professional one. I own a lot of concert DVDs/Blu-rays and have not noticed with any other concert. It doesn't make it unwatchable but it does lower the quality of the spectacle. I'd still recommend this box set for any music fan. R.E.M. was truly a great band that left its mark in the American music. Michael Stipe's vocals are amazing and he sounds even more amazing in concert.
