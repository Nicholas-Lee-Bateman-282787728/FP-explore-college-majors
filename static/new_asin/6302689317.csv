498877,5,6302689317,"What a film debut for Sunset Carson! 'Call of the Rockies' is one action packed Saturday Matinee Western. In this movie we have the tall baby-faced hero in Sunset Carson; as well the humor and sly antics of Smiley Burnette, longtime Gene Autry sidekick. In this story our odd pair of heroes are drawn into the plot of a crooked townsman who is out to destroy the Placer City mine. Fistfights and shootouts work for many cowboys to solve problems, but what sets these boys apart from the crowd is their wiley and cunning. But this is also far from being a movie just about outsmarting the badguy, as it is filled with action. Gunfights, a runaway wagon headed right at you, and a flooding mine shaft scene that has to be seen is just some of the action that will have you out of your seat. To top it all off, Smiley does an audience participation scene for the kids. 'Call of the Rockies' is a true western oater where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the story and action keep it moving. This is one movie that certainly was as good if not better than the box said it would be.--Bob",1102636800,3,1099,4.288461538461538
