7947757,4,B00005NOP2,"Standard sword and sandal B grade movie from the 80's, filmed in Argentina before political correctness destroyed movies.

 Not a super bad movie, but no academy award winning material either.  A village of peaceful peasant people get attacked by ugly ruthless warlords, as they steal, pillage, rape, and torture their victims along the way.  The late Lana Clarkson is a blond bombshell sword fighter out for justice and revenge against the warriors who attacked her people.

Not anywhere as good as Arnold with ""Conan"" nor is it as good as other franchise genres of similar ilk, but I would say it is a fair amount of mindless low budget and cheap thrill entertainment for maybe ages 11 and above.  I would rate this movie PG-13, but there are themes of rated R for the violence level, even if the acting is bad and the action scenes are pretty rough around the edges and corny.  Any 6th grader could have written this plot.",1475020800,,925,4.672839506172839

7947759,4,B00005NOP2,"Slightly better than the first and highly recommended to fans of swords and sorcery exploitation flicks. Definitely worth a look, a fun popcorn and beer flick!",1361404800,3,159,5.153846153846154
7947760,4,B00005NOP2,If you like a tongue-in-cheek good guy vs bad guy movie with a lot of good looking women running around in half dressed fashion waving swords with some lite bondage thrown in you'll have fun with this movie.,1320192000,3,207,4.473684210526316
7947761,3,B00005NOP2,"Like others of this ilke, nowhere near as good as the cover. As a sword and sorcery fan I enjoyed the rom which was worth watching but a little disappointing.",1286496000,,158,4.3
7947762,5,B00005NOP2,"Although this movie had nothing at all to do with Barbarian Queen 1 & Had horrible props { the swords were cheap plastic toys}I thought this movie was great!!! Bad props that's all that lacked.  It would have been better If Rick Hill made an appearance in the movie But all in all awesome movie Even Joe Bob Briggs,  gave it 4 stars AND SO Do I.....Better than the first in many ways,
a Must Buy",1006905600,12,395,4.184210526315789
