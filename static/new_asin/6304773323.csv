7877165,5,6304773323,"Funnier, lighthearted version of Raylan, from Justified. Based on the first book, Pronto, from Elmore Leonard.

On VHS, this is worth going to the used electronics store, to find a VCR, just to play this. Why? Peter Falk, Glenne Headly and an over-exuberant James LeGros, with a ridiculously large hat.",1419379200,,302,5.04
7877166,3,6304773323,Slow at times.  Enjoyable.  Always love Peter Falk.  Funny seeing another actor playing Raylan Givens.  Needs to draw viewer into the suspense and action more.,1394841600,,159,5.24
7877167,2,6304773323,"Peter Falk is great as the bookie being hunted by the mob. The casting for the Raylan Givens character (it's not T. Olyphant who does it wonderfully) is awful.  Givens is portrayed as a country bumpkin idiot who can shoot.  Boring and actually hard to watch.  However, as mentioned above, Falk is a delight.",1340150400,,307,4.648148148148148
7877168,5,6304773323,"Very entertaining movie
director, Jim McBride after a novel
by Elmore Leonard.
Extremely funny Sergio Castellitto,
and James LaGros is very good.",1252713600,4,145,5.636363636363637
