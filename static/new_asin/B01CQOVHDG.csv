7688875,5,B01CQOVHDG,"Wonderful collection. ""The World In Our Arms"" is a bit campy, but the other 3 films make up for it! Worth every penny!",1471996800,,118,4.173913043478261

7688877,3,B01CQOVHDG,"It's good to have the films. The quality of Arabesque was good. I have not watched the others yet. I do prefer individual films having their own discs with all the extras, but it seems those days are gone. Not a bad deal for the price at all.",1466812800,4,242,4.0625
7688878,4,B01CQOVHDG,"Two of the movies are excellent, 5 star acting and story with Gregory Peck, the video and audio copies are excellent.  Arabesque and Mirage are enjoyable but 3 star for story and acting, the copies could be better.",1513209600,,214,4.631578947368421
7688879,5,B01CQOVHDG,"If you are like me and want widescreen movies in the widescreen format, you'll be very disappointed with this set. Amazon lists this as Widescreen (only). Now, The World in his Arms (1952) is the only flat screen entry here. Arabesque is in Widescreen, as it should be. Mirage (1965) & Captain Newman, M.D. (1963) are both presented in flat screen, when they are both in Widescreen (1:85). I for one, am very unhappy with this set.
The movies are otherwise in excellent condition. Like I said, if you don't care about aspect ratio, then please get this set. Otherwise, buy the singles of Mirage & Captain Newman, they list as being in Widescreen (1:85). I will be purchasing both singles.",1507248000,3,688,4.694214876033058

7688883,5,B01CQOVHDG,"These 4 packs are wonderful for quality of discs and space-saving (4 discs in one case), I had been looking for ""The World In His Arms"" with co-star Ann Blyth and ""Captain Newman"" and to find them all in one package along with ""Arabesque"" and ""Mirage"" was just too much to hope for. Wonderful addition to my Gregory Peck collection.",1497571200,,332,4.55

8753901,5,B01CQOVHDG,"Excellent movies, especially the doctor one.  The military was just beginning to deal with the fall out of war and this is a good peak at the start",1533859200,,147,4.25
8753902,5,B01CQOVHDG,A fine collection showing off what a good actor Gregory Peck was. Not a bad one in the bunch.,1529366400,,93,3.9473684210526314

8753905,5,B01CQOVHDG,I considered all of the movies in this collection good. They sucked you into the movie and made you think.  This is unusual for  a four movie collection.,1524441600,,153,4.428571428571429
8753906,3,B01CQOVHDG,"Gregory Peck has made some great films.  This collection only shows glimmers of that greatness.  Arabesque in particular was a disappointment.  It was a typical 1960s elitist piece.  I didn't care for the smug tone and thin plot of this film.

The seller offered this product at a reasonable price.  It arrived in good time and in good condition.",1524268800,,346,4.779661016949152
8753907,5,B01CQOVHDG,"A very good collection of classic Gregory Peck films. The only one that is a little sub optimal is ""The World In His Arms"", but still is a decent film. ""Arabesque"", ""Mirage"" and ""Captain Newman, M.D."" are all great films. Would recommend to any classic movie lover.",1522713600,,265,4.659574468085107
8753908,3,B01CQOVHDG,"I hugely enjoyed all these films as a kid, but viewing them now as an adult it is very clear they are dated.  Arabesque is a kind of spy comedy; unfortunately, the chemistry between Peck and Loren is forced and the story is silly in its outlandishness.  Mirage is a good amnesiac whodunnit, images of which had stuck in my mind for over 50 years; a good yarn so long as you can suspend your disbelief.  The World is supposed to be a romantic swashbuckler, it is the weakest of the lot by far.  Captain Newman is the only one that actually offers something original, though again, it was made when psychoanalysis was the reigning philosophy of mental health; there are many memorable performances, particularly the guilt ridden commander Eddie Albert.

Recommended.",1520121600,,764,4.757575757575758
8753909,4,B01CQOVHDG,"Mainly got this for two films ""Captain Newman MD"" and ""Arabesque"",the latter being a very underrated film. Have watched ""Mirage"",okay but not one of Peck's best.

Still worth the purchase though,but I am biased as I have always been a big GP fan.",1515801600,,246,4.72093023255814
8753910,5,B01CQOVHDG,If you like Gregory Peck three of these movies really shows his talent as an actor. But Captain Newman to a lesser extent as it is light comedy mixed with a serious favor. The others shows his forte in suspense and action. Very good buy.,1514332800,,237,4.288888888888889
