7370430,3,B013PT9IEG,"I've thought about this film seriously after a disturbing night after viewing it. Reader beware. The Spanish film directed by Marcel Fores is a quagmire that may well suck you into thought ,or repulsion,or perhaps pleasure if if it strikes the right dissonant cord with you. For some viewers the full rear and frontal nudity ,sex, and gay characters may be sufficient tintilation . I am a gay man and I'm pleased to see some naked flesh in a film that is not a porno flick . I'm also old enough to remember a time when anything with a gay note was enough to demand my attention even if it was hateful and drenched in negativity. I was willing to be offended just to see someone on screen who loved/ desired the same sex.
  To the plot --before you stop reading . It is brief. Carlos a late middle aged teacher( 50's I'd guess) cruises for sexual encounters after work in the woods ( murky as something from a Grimm's fairy tale-- not a pun on purpose). The wood is somewhere near Barcelona , I think . It might be in other parts of the world where I'm sure such places exist. Apparently ,at times, he is satisfied just to watch others and masterbate . Remember, you as a viewer are also a voyeur . He meets one of his students in the wood . He and Toni eventually have anal sex in the teacher's auto. The sex seems to be fervent and in abandon . The young man asks questions that suggest he is looking for more than the fleeting encounter. Toni has a most singular group of "" friends. I thought of them as followers of Charles Mason , or eventually devotees of Hannibal Lector , or even obsessed fans of a newly visioned ,heidious Dracula.
  Joan Bentalle' who plays Carlos from my perspective is the main character and the best actor in the film . Without him there would be no ""dessert"". The other actors are good enough to be chilling. While one may think the cinematography is great( It does fit the subject matter to some extent ) , I longed for some light on this tale of the darkest of midnights . It is a horror film far more than a film that might be labeled as ""gay themed"" . It crossed my mind that in a way that the plot might actually be , most likely unintengently ,homophobic. What ! Are you crazy ,you ask. Well, think of the formula slasher films where the young ,always attractive or at least unique, girls or boys who have given themselves up to the flesh are murdered. The gay person or the "" sinner"", the OTHER must die to abide to some archaic code lost in a distant creation generated out of fear of differences or religion . Because of my age , when I think back, to the first books and films with gays or lesbians included or as subject matter ,eventually , they were dead at the end unless they were distorted images treated as a mere source of humor . Happy endings? In the real past in our nation ( not Ancient Greece) ,one had to look to Walt Disney and make believe where the prince would come for you ,or Snow White would be awakened by a beautiful Snow White. Your ability to imagine this  , sadly , was dependent upon you, kept hidden from the threat of jaiI ,asylums, family most likely, work and those mighty houses built for worship. I  wonder if the director would ever consider filming /directing a film a complex same-sex love story that had the potential to lift the spirit and challenge the mind and maybe as an unexpected happenstance educate those who are not glbtq.
  In conclusion, happily the film is short, a touch over an hour. The plot didn't need that much. True character development  that was more than a superficial device would have called for more time . The viewer must decide if a bit of erotic voyeurism ending with a repulsive ,bloody "" Devouring ""worse than anything suggested in Tennessee  William's "" Suddenly Last Summer""  is worth calling a psychotic love"" ---- everlasting . If I desired chilling edge-of -one's-seat suspense , I'd watch ""Night of The Hunter"" (1959).  For a male same-sex love story , Maurice , based on E.M. Forester's novel is hard to beat. Good luck with what ever delights you. Just be careful if you wander in the woods. The extra star is for those with a stronger constitution than mine and can handle nightmares, otherwise two would be closer to real evaluation.",1451088000,14,4251,4.408163265306122
7370431,4,B013PT9IEG,"Your main character is named Carlos. Carlos is a school teacher who teaches language. Carlos has an appetite for sex, or at least watching others have sex. After work he adventures into a local spot in the woods near Barcelona. His lust and desire is calmed night after night by watching random moments of sexual pleasure. One night he meets one of his students there, named Toni. They explore each other, and so begins the student, teacher relationship, or lack of. There is a mystery surrounding the teenage boy. This mystery also involves his group of friends.

Directed and co-written by Marcal Fores. Fores has a very unique idea of imagery by displaying a story through a darkened reality of choices, conscience and evil. This is a very sexually graphic film. A touchy film that explores some twisted realities.

This film is a very different film. It has parts erotic sexuality, and equal parts scary mystery. Carlos enters into a world that slowly decides to drag him down into a darkness. The local news is about acts of depravity, happening in the local area. There is a psycho-sexual aspect to this film. An exploration into a world of random sexual encounters, and the horrors that might come with it.

A dark film. Solid and brilliant acting by all. The direction is flawless. The storyline is very deep, and very oddly erotic. The movie is very interesting, and its very hard to explain if you haven't seen it. I don't want to give too much away, and that is way I am trying to be very scarce. I think its biggest accomplishment is taking many plot lines, or stories, and creating a mystery of the characters. You really never know where its going. Loved the Drama, or Psychological twist.

The movie is filmed brilliantly. The camera work, long shots, and dramatic lighting give it a beating heart as if you're watching moments happen. Youre the spy, the voyeur. The movie is like entering a world of an art-house film. The camera work along with the subject matter, and the mysterious characters, create an emotional baggage upon the viewer. Its an emotional baggage that I wish to explore, because the film itself is an emotional calamity.

Joan Bentalle is strikingly brilliant as the character of Carlos. He is able to make you feel his tension, desire, heated intensity, and most of all the lingering, and wondering of what is about to happen. Aimar Vega is the true winner of the show. He created Toni to be remembered. He displayed a haunting and yet deeply, dark, sexuality that makes you want to question your own thoughts. That is also something so brilliant about this film is Marcal Fores, created, and directed a film, that you really, should not like the characters. There is a dirty, gritty feeling. It almost leads you to want to take a bath.

A great, odd, dark film, with deeper aspects of sex, and erotic diversity. Intense. Highly Recommended. It is a unique, and very original film. Great acting. Great direction, and an equally great mysterious story.

7370432,3,B013PT9IEG,"We meet Carlos who is a language teacher in Spain and he likes doing a bit of cruising in his local woods where he meets other men who are into the same thing. Then one evening he meets Toni who is one of his students and they go for it.

The thing is that Toni seems to be more keen than his erstwhile tutor and a relationship- of sorts  happens. Only Toni is not all he seems to be and has some very unusual friends who soon intend to encroach on the situation.

Now this has had some mixed reviews and I agree it is not the best film ever made. It is though well acted and filmed but it can be seen as slow and it seems to struggle with what it wants to be and ends up being a sort of sexual voyeuristic horror. Still not a bad effort hence my rating.",1445644800,8,754,3.883116883116883
