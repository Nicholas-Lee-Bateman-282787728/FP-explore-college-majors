3076699,5,B00125JPN0,"""The Best of THE PRICE IS RIGHT"" is a wonderful DVD collection.  It is a blast seeing all the early episodes of THE NEW PRICE IS RIGHT I grew up on.  I was seven when it started in 1972.  The video quality is terrific and makes for great rewatchability.  The early episodes from the Bill Cullen years were neat to see; especially since one of them featured a neighbor of ours from my home town.  I never expected one of her episodes would be included.  I had heard about it all my life.  What a surprise.  Bob Barker's humor with the contestants is priceless.  I laughed so hard watching these shows.  Only 26 episodes out of over 6000 must have been hard to choose from, but I am glad there are a lot from 1972-1975.  I suspect more volumes of ""The Best of THE PRICE IS RIGHT"" will be forthcoming, as the show continues to thrive with Drew Carey now at the helm.",1207526400,,863,4.233128834355829
3076700,5,B00125JPN0,"I haven't seen the entire set but I have seen most of Disc One and I'm totally impressed.  The video quality is excellent from the Bob Barker shows (despite the disappointment of the omitted premiere show).  The Bill Cullen version is interesting but ebjoyable regardless.  Still, it was worth every penny and not to be missed!",1207353600,,327,4.803571428571429
3076701,4,B00125JPN0,"This four-disc DVD is tremendous. We get the roots of the show with Bill Cullen and the black haired Bob Barker from his early episodes. Tremendous! Seeing '70s celebrities like Charles Nelson Reilly and Bert Convy help plug the show's expansion into one-hour is fun.
While there aren't as many games in the early Barker years (get ready for a lot of ""The Grocery Game""), it's still a lot of fun to watch. I get a kick out of seeing cars that cost $2-4,000 and seeing Johnny Olsen acting in the Showcase Showdown.
One drawback is the selection of episodes. The Barker era skips from 1972-1975 time period to his last week in 2007. Not on this set are any shows from the 1980s or 1990s. Certainly there are many moments (like Vanna White as a contestant, the lady fainting, the contestant in the bathroom etc.) that would be great to see again. Skipping those decades, unfortunately, means Rod Roddy announced shows aren't there.
What is on this set is gold and is well worth the money. What isn't there is worthy of additional ""Best of Price is Right"" volumes. Hopefully the creators of this set will agree.",1206576000,2,1107,4.595959595959596
3076702,5,B00125JPN0,"I can honestly say that I've watched The Price Is Right ever since I was a baby (or at least a toddler) and grew up with it. Call me weird, but for the past 5 years or so I've searched the web for TPIR sites hoping to see early episodes of the show. With The Price Is Right being into its 36th continuous year on the air, I never thought I'd see as much as rerun of a previous episode. And now here I am watching a younger, dark-haired Bob Barker being introduced on a 1972 episode of The NEW Price Is Right - and all I can say is WOW!!!!!

It's no wonder The Price Is Right has been on TV for so long. An episode from over 30 years ago is just as exciting as a current episode (before Bob retired, of course). This DVD set is a treasure! It contains 4 episodes of the 1950's and early 1960's shows hosted by Bill Cullen. The rest is all classic Bob Barker shows from 1972, 73, 74, 75 and Bob's entire final week as host. You also get the very first hour-long show with the Showcase Showdown. All the famous pricing games and memorable contestants are here as well as the opening cards and ticket plugs.

If you are a true Price Is Right fan, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO OWN THIS DVD SET!!!

And thanks to Amazon.com for shipping it to me so quickly! It arrived to me MUCH sooner than I expected.",1206403200,3,1294,4.046875
3076703,4,B00125JPN0,"There is no doubt about it, when it comes down to game shows, The Price Is Right has remained as the only constant on television, while many other game shows have came and gone. But, that doesn't mean that The Price is Right remained the same. It still has shown for over 35 years on CBS, that the show still is as popular as ever. This past year, comedian and host of The Power Of 10, Drew Carey took over the reigns as the host, while the original legend, Bob Barker, retired after an astronomical 50 years on television. But, now the game show is finally making it on the DVD makret. After other game shows from the Mark Goodson Productions catalog have dominated the past few years like Match Game with Gene Rayburn, and the recently released All-Star Family Feud with their original host Richard Dawson made it to home video, how does The Price Is Right stand out, here is the actual retail price.

The Best Of The Price Is Right is a 4 disc DVD that showcase some of The Price Is Right's beginnings and ends of a generation with Bob Barker. The compilation primarily focuses in on the CBS game shows first and last shows Bob hosted. The collection includes the very few shows when Bob hosted the show back in 1972, when they first offered cars like a Chevrolet Vega worth $2,746, all the way to his final week of shows from June 11th - June 15th 2007. The shows have all been remastered from top to bottom. But, Bob isn't the only person as host on this DVD set, as an added bonus for original fans, the collection features very rare episodes of the very first version of The Price Is Right with Bill Cullen all the way back in the 50's and 60's when it was on NBC. Those shows mark a rare treat for what influenced the long-running game show, and what has delivered for so many years.

While there are a lot of Price Is Right fans that feel very dissapointed that there are so many episodes that haven't made it to DVD, The Best Of The Price Is Right works as a great sampler for die hard Price Is Right fans, and for anyone who hasn't even yet seen a glimpse of Bob Barker saying to help control the pet population. All that I can hope for is that there is more one volume of this great game show on home video sometime soon. That price should be right without going over.

3076724,5,B00125JPN0,It's amazing how in some aspects this show changed very little over the 35 years that Bob Barker hosted. This is a fun collection and hope in the future more are released.,1350950400,,171,4.375
3076725,5,B00125JPN0,"I have been watching the Price Is Right since I was a kid in the 70s. I agree with most of the reviews here, I'm disapointed they didn't include bloppers and outtakes. But the episodes from 1972 to 1975 are fantastic fun to see . It is well worth the bargin price to see these  vintage 70's episodes and the quality is perfect. It looks like they filmed it yesterday! The very cool retro prizes like a 73 VW, 70's clothes and hairdos are loads of fun and laughs! Bob Barker was always so handsome and smooth, it's fun seeing him in the beginning. He always had the magic touch. I do miss hearing him say ""Have your pets spayed and neutered."" Long time beautiful prize model Janis Pennington who was a 1971 Playboy Playmate, was there from the start.  Maybe someday they will release a bigger collection with more episodes from the late 70's and early 80's to the late 80s on DVD with all the crazy contestents, but for now this is fun to see. Don't miss it if you love Price Is Right!",1320364800,,984,4.28494623655914
3076726,2,B00125JPN0,"I was very disapointed in this dvd.  I was thinking it would contain moments that have become icons of the show itself.  I find it very boring and repetive.  I have been a fan of the show since I was old enough to watch it.  I was hoping to see clips of memorable moments.  As far as needs improvements goes, it would have been nice to see bloopers, outtakes, mishaps, or decent, but unusal things that happened from time.  I can recall situations like 5 zeros int Plinko game; a key getting stuck the lock durning Master Key; a lady landing flat on her back after trying to spin the big wheel, and even a contestant fainting after being told she won her showcase.  None of this was included.  I was thinking that Bob Barker might appear introducing the episodes and perhaps commenting and remincing.  A special tribute to Johnny Olson would have been nice also.  Afterall, he made the show's trademark expression ""Come on down,""  for ever famous.  This is little more than a panaroma of shows.  The only thing I find special is the final DVD which contains Bob Barker's last week.  Finnaly, we get to see The Price is Right that we came to know and love.  I would not recomend anyone spending money on this.",1313971200,4,1208,4.4520547945205475
3076727,3,B00125JPN0,"This set definatly has some flaws, but for less than eight bucks it's certainly worth buying if you are a fan of the show.  The case is one of the worst cases I have ever seen.  Discs 2 and 4 are locked in under discs 1 and 3 and I found it annoying and more of a hastle to unlock that it should be.  I ended up digging out a pair of pliers and breaking off a couple of the tabs so it wouldn't lock shut.  There also isn't enough of a variety of episodes.  The first 3 discs contain episodes from 1972 thru 1975 and the 4th disc contains Bob Barker's final week from 2007.  That's quite a jump in the timeline.  There are zero episodes from the 80's and zero episodes from the 90's.  That means there are no episodes featuring Rod Roddy as the announcer, which was very disappointing to me.  So after you buy this set, go to youtube and download some of the Price is Right episodes that have been uploaded there.  Then you will have a more complete history and timeline of this classic show.",1302998400,3,991,4.141361256544503
3076728,4,B00125JPN0,"I love the price is right, watch it every day almost.  I was excited to get the best of, and it truly is awesome. You can see the development of the episodes, the introduction of the wheel, episodes from the 60's before Bob, and Bob's last week.

The DVD's in between are all from 1-2 years.. I figured the Best Of would be the Best Of, not just one episode from each month of the year 1976.

Very enjoyable though, love it.",1302134400,,424,4.146341463414634

3076730,5,B00125JPN0,this is one of my favorite shows me and my friend get together every christmas and watch movies so he will love this one if u love the price is right buy this set,1285891200,,162,3.7941176470588234
3076731,4,B00125JPN0,"The Price was Right for what I paid for this multiple-DVD disk set, to be able to see the early days with Bill Cullen, the 70's version and the last week of Price with Bob Barker. Much like many of the other customer reviews, I though it would have been nice to see more of the 80's and 90's shows. Had I been putting together this set, I would have included the CBS Night Time Price Is Right Tribute To Bob Barker, maybe some of the Million Dollar Spectulars, and how about special highlight episodes featuring Pricing Games current and retired. It might have been nice to see other guest hosts back in the early days and how about Tom Kennedy's 1985 Night Time Price Is Right? GSN used to feature some of these fine shows, but as someone else said, those days of good programming are gone- now I don't even watch GSN....thank goodness for YouTube! Either way by owning a piece of television history....you win! Don't forget to help the pet population, have your pet spay or neutered... Good Bye Everybody.",1285200000,,1007,4.508196721311475
3076732,5,B00125JPN0,"This 26 episode DVD of The Price Is Right brings back plenty of memories of Bob Barker who hosted it for 35 years on CBS. He was a master of those pricing games, showcases and showcase showdowns. I am starting to view those early 30 minute episodes of 1972 thru 1975. Those 4 older Bill Cullen episodes are a special terrific treat, because I was not around when Cullen's version aired and enjoy watching those vintage shows as well. I hope Mill Creek who took over from BCI puts together a 2nd Edition Best of Price Is Right that I hope will include episodes from the late 70's, 80's, 90's and between 2000-2007 along with some more of the early 1970's shows, including the 3 classic TPIR shows that CBS aired in 1998, 2000 and 2002.",1279152000,3,734,4.404411764705882

Waste of time and money.",1261353600,,311,4.293103448275862
3076740,4,B00125JPN0,"Being a game show fan. I bought this set at Best Buy soon after its release. I had read about what would be on the set, so I wasn't as disappointed with some of the models and decades not being included. I also know why they weren't included, since I read and post regularly on a few web sites. For those not in the know, I'll share:

Very first show is not included - because the very first item up for bids (IUFB) was a FUR COAT. Bob Barker has since become an animal rights activist and wouldn't clear the show, even though BCI, the makers of this collection, agreed to add a disclaimer. I think I have to side with Bob on this - it would be nice to see the show for historical purposes, but it does make him look like a hypocrite.

Missing models and decades - Barker and his beauties have beefs with each other. He admitted to an affair he had with Dian Parkinson, who sued him for $8 million afterwards. Holly Holstrom sued him for unlawful termination when she was fired in 1995 for being overweight. She got money in a settlement that was reportedly in the millions. Janice and Kathleen were let go in 2000, mainly because they testified in Holly's lawsuit against Barker and sided with Holly. They supposedly were paid a severence package in agreement not to sue. The 80s and 90s shows featured all of the models mentioned. Apparently Barker doesn't want to models to get any more money. Janice is featured since she was on from the first show and Diane is on an hour-long show. No Holly or Kathleen in this set.

No Rod Roddy - Bob reportedly got mad at Rod when he (Rod) went to negotiate for himself and the models that their salary for the nighttime specials should be equal to if not more than the daytime show. Bob cut Rod's on-camera time from the show after that. The excuse given was they ""no longer show announcers on camera."" Rod is not featured at all in this collection.

Other than that, the collection shows how the present day TPIR evolved from a friendly, sometimes unpolished show to the slick and smooth show it is today, with Barker's last week included. The Bill Cullen shows are a great treat as well. Yes, there was a TPIR back in the 50s and 60s, and the Cullen shows prove it. Plus to hear Johnny O say ""Come on down"" once again. He's the one who made that phrase famous.",1255910400,34,2305,4.341067285382831
3076741,4,B00125JPN0,"The earlier black and white shows (with Bill Cullen) are not that good. But the ones with Bob Barker are great. Looking at what the fashion and hairstyles were like back then is outrageous. The prices of the prizes back then will make you sick. One example: A BRAND NEW 1973 CORVETTE STINGRAY was selling for $6,950.....",1255564800,5,320,4.631578947368421
3076742,5,B00125JPN0,"Firstly, I'd like to agree with previous reviews that this isn't really a ""Best Of"" compilation, but I think much of the criticism is overly harsh, with some reviewers giving this a one star rating. My guess is that the title, ""Best of Price is Right,"" was chosen for lack of a better name. The episodes do seem to be fairly random, and while I'm not sure the reason for this, I doubt ""Random Episodes of the Price is Right's Early Years"" would have had a nice ring to it. I also doubt we could all agree on which episodes are the ""best"", so pleasing everyone would be impossible.

However, what you do get is worth every penny:

The first disc contains mostly episodes from the original 1950s series (i.e. pre-Bob Barker days), and while I didn't expect much going in, I have to admit these early episodes have a certain charm. They also provide a good comparison / contrast to the more familiar series we all know and love.

The second and third discs contain episodes from 1972 (the first season) to 1975. It would have been nice to have the very first episode included in this set, but you get a good sampling, none the less. It's interesting to see the very early episodes where many of the seats were empty and mistakes and malfunctions in the equipment are common. As time progressed, audience attendance increased and new games are added... and some games (like the unwinnable bullseye game) are dropped.

The fourth disc contains episodes from Bob Barker's final week on the show. I haven't watched this disc yet, but I'm looking forward to it since I missed these when they originally aired.

Having grown up watching TPIR (since the early 1980s anyway), I'm excited to be able to own ANY of the early episodes in a long-lasting, high-quality format. Until now, the only way I could relive some of the early material was via low-quality chopped-up scenes featured on YouTube.

I sincerly hope this won't be the last of these sets. I would LOVE to see more episodes from the 1970s and early 1980s! Sadly, I have a feeling there are no plans in the works to do this.

PS. It's great to look back at the products and prizes on the show and know in those days they were all MADE IN AMERICA!!!",1253923200,13,2198,4.507537688442211
3076743,2,B00125JPN0,"The DVD set is chock full of early Barker material, as many have mentioned here, which is usually the point of these DVDs. So, if your a fan of that, this should be a good purchase. However, being more a fan of early TV, the first of four discs offers just four shows of the Bill Cullen years, which is sadly not enough. The most interesting part of looking back @ such a show as this is for the history of our economy, specifically our cost of living: boats, cars, Hi Fis, Americana, etc. I've seen the early years on the Game Show Network and it's by far the most fascinating. I mean, this is how we lived in the 50s & 60s!!! However, this is just not the DVD set for that! So, beware!!!",1245628800,3,689,4.111111111111111
3076744,4,B00125JPN0,"Many have harped about the DVD set ""The Best Of The Price Is Right"" for its selection of its earliest four years of the CBS show and Bob Barker's final week as it excludes some noted show models. Others, who were born way after the CBS show began, think the Bill Cullen shows shouldn't have been included (""It's not in color!..."" ""it doesn't have pricing games!..."" ""the contestants aren't crazy!..."" ""we can't psychoanalyze the lettering font in a game display!""). Cry me a river, all of you. Cullen's show was TV's top game in its day and Barker's version probably wouldn't have made it on the air without it paving the way. As for the selection of Barker episodes, let it stand as a testament, a litmus test, of how it started as a ""Let's Make A Deal"" ripoff and became TV's longest running game. If anyone's to blame for not having a wider spread of shows, blame either CBS or Barker himself and his beef with the excluded models.",1241049600,11,934,4.5

This set has some great vintage Bob Barker episodes from the 70's and it was a lot of fun watching the old prizes, with the old prices!! Also as a bonus there were some episodes of the original Price is Right. But the greatest part of this set are that it includes the entire last week of The Price is Right with Bob Barker! You'll be able to enjoy watching the best gameshow host of all time Bob Barker hosting the greatest game show of all time The Price is Right for years to come. We can only hope that they release a volume 2!! Like I said, if you aren't a true fan then don't buy this.

I have a problem with this being promoted as the ""Best of The Price Is Right"".  This is in fact a compilation of what seems as the first season of The Price Is Right, their move to 1 hour episodes and the last week of Bob Barker.

She had class and wonderful stage presence, not to mention BEAUTIFUL!! I was shocked that she was on this DVD set so much. It is great to relive my old childhood TPIR memories. BRAVO!! I would like to see another volume however with my other favorite models: Holly and Dian. Gotta love it!!",1211760000,2,584,4.27027027027027
3076750,4,B00125JPN0,"I am glad this came out, and I would recommend buying it, but it was not as large or as well-produced as expected. Overall, it feels hurried (the DVD menu is awful), and not as good as the Match Game DVD set.
The first disc is devoted to the Bill Cullen TPIR, which is interesting, but I expected it to be like the Match Game DVD set, which only had one episode of its original run. Discs two and three encompass The [New] Price Is Right from 1972 to 1976. Disc four is Barker's last week on the show.
Yes, 2 and 3 feature an awful lot of the Grocery Game and One Right Price, but all the episodes on these discs feature interesting contestants other than the tubetop lady. Also, these discs feature two rare TPIR celebrity appearances: Bert Convy (host of Tattletales) and Charles Nelson Reilly (Match Game panelist).
The video quality is stunning (on par with the Match Game set), but the audio is a bit soft. The DVD packaging is almost there: it is hard to read some of the text, but captures the overall feeling. The liner notes pamphlet is loose (not in a pocket), so it is difficult to reinsert the DVD folder into the slipcase. And it's hard to see the disc numbers. Liner notes are from Golden-Road.net (a fan site), which is surprising, but could have used some editing. On the other hand, I'm glad to see the hard work of fans acknowleged rather than fought, so thumbs up to Fremantle for that!
The biggest disappointment is that there's not one moment from the 80s or 90s. I would have thought that the first episode with Plinko in 1982 would have been on there, or that the first episode with Cliff Hangers would have been on there, or Johnny Olsen's last episode, etc. No Rod Roddy and his sparkly jackets either. No ""reach into my pocket"" for the perfect One Bid bonus. No split-screen with the wheel. Few skit-based showcases.
Also, despite what the Amazon ""author"" line says, there's no episodes featuring Doug Davidson or Dennis James (which is probably a good thing.)
Overall: buy it. Hopefully, they will come out with a second volume (and please please come out with a Match Game Vol. 2 too!)",1210896000,5,2113,4.490909090909091

The only disappointing factor is that there were no episodes from 75-06. I recently seen all of Barkers last week at the helm, so I have yet to view that disk.

3076755,3,B00125JPN0,"As a devotee of the 35 Year ""Price Is Right"" since Day One, I was a bit disappointed in this set, as when I watched, I thought I had missed something.  From Disc 3, you jump from the first Nov 1975 hour show to Disc 4 and the final 5 daytime episodes.  There is a lot missing.

I am grateful to BCI for including 4 episodes of the original ""Price Is Right"" with Bill Cullen, as I grew up on this version.  Glad that a daytime episode and the fantasic more-opulant prize evening editions (giving away new homes) are included, especially the very last nighttime ""Price"" from 1964 where a celebrity was on the panel and played for people in the audience.

I feel that who put this together stayed heavily with the first season in 1972-73.  One rare thing you never see now is a half-filled audience.  I would figure in respect for Bob Barker, the first episode aired is not included, because the first item up for bids was a fur coat.  However, most of the episodes selected always had the first incarnation of the Grocery Game constantly.  Would have liked to have seen more variety.  Inclusion of the original ""Bullseye - 7 Bid"" game for a car, plus the two-contestant version were a must to show.  However, no reference to the current Bullseye game (one of my favorites).  I am glad that the special hour anniversary week that proceeded the conversion to an hour format was included.  The original wheel was a hoot!  Having the official first hour show is also a plus.  What happened to 1976 through May 2007?  If it were possible,  this could have been a 5-disc set.  A full disc of Bill Cullen on Disc 1 depending on how many original Price shows were available (seeing some on Game Show Network during Black & White Nights over the years showed ""some"", but doubt the entire series is available).  Disc 2 should be ""Early Years"" from 1972-75 in the half hour format, with the evolution of the show and several games past and present.
Disc 3 could've been one of the Anniversary Week one-hour shows, the first hour show, then a best of the later 70's hour shows.  Disc 4 representing the 80s, 90s and 2000.  Disc 5 to include 2001 - 2007, with the Bob's 50th in TV Anniversary Special, the 30th Anniversary show taped in Vegas (I was there for that one) and the very last daytime show, vs. the full final week.

Also missing....bonus features.  The only surprise bonus I found was they left in a Beano commercial, as well as advising how to order tickets for the new Drew Carey episodes.  Where was an interview with past contestants you could find?  Bloopers?  Models then and now?  Something on Roger Dobkowitz and his involvement all these years?  Retired games that worked and didn't work (Hurdles for one that always broke down).

If they proceed with a Best Of Volume 2, I hope they include the complete shows with the woman who lost her top coming on down, the woman who won the first Grand game and chased Bob all over the set, the complete show with Ethel who had the dream about Bob in the hayloft, and other gems.  Greatest wins should also be considered with two that come to mind...the closest Showcase bid being $5 from the actual price, and an episode where two woman were $30 and $29 away from the actual price creating a double-showcase winner regardless.  Would be nice to see who the first double-showcase winner was, who the highest scoring Plinko player is, the guy who gave up $5000 on the Punchboard to win $10000 right after, and who was the first highest amount daytime winner ever.

Remember Bob's first show with white hair? (Oct. 1987)  He said something like, ""If you were watching yesterday, my hair was dark.  Boy, let me tell you, the blind date I had last night ...!""

It gives a glimpse of the birth of the longest-running game show in history, with games like ""Any Number"" and ""Hi-Lo"" that have become staples, and others like ""Give or Keep"" and ""Bullseye I"" that have passed into history.

Understanding Bob Barker's stance on animal rights, it's a shame that so many episodes likely will not be released until after his death because fur coats were given as prizes.  As much as I respect his stand, it also deprives game-show lovers of valuable segments of history.

The episodes contained in this collection are priceless indeed - starting with the four black-and-white shows with the beloved Bill Cullen, right through the early episodes (great trip down memory lane when contestants were attired nicely).

For me there were a couple of drawbacks - great to see Bob Barker's final week included, but disappointed that no episodes from the 1980s and 1990s are represented.  Also, it would have been extra nice to include special tributes to two men who preceded Rich Fields in the announcer's podium - the sorely missed Johnny Olson and Rod Roddy.

3076762,5,B00125JPN0,"Few game shows have managed the popularity and endurance of TPiR, and this DVD set has been long-awaited for fans like me. Highlights include:

- 3 shows from the very first week, featuring the short-lived ""Bullseye I"" game (unfortunately, the premiere is not among them, since BCI was unable to compromise w/Barker over a fur coat being a prize in said ep)
- A 1972 episode w/the equally short-lived ""Double Bullseye"" (the only 2-player pricing game in TPiR's history, and thus the only one that ever guaranteed a win)
- A show from the 3rd anniversary week, where the hour format is first tried (featuring a completely different Showcase Showdown wheel!)
- The first permanent hour show
- 4 eps of the Bill Cullen version
- Barker's entire final week

And much like BCI's earlier GS compilations (Match Game and All-Star Family Feud), all fee/ticket plugs are included for each ep, but this collection also includes something neither of the earlier 2 did: production slates! Nothing huge, but def cool to see and a nice little added bonus.

My only complaint is over the inclusion of Barker's farewell week...yes, his last show should be on there, but I see no reason to include the rest of that week, especially considering there was no mention of the fact during those first 4 eps. If they wanted something more recent, why not one of the primetime anniversary shows, or Barker's final primetime show that saluted his TV career? But I understand that this collection had to be assembled w/Barker's approval, so it's not really a big deal and still a must-have for any game show/TPiR fan out there, and I hope it's the first of several volumes...there's still another 30+ years worth of shows waiting to be represented, and I'm sure the 1-star reviewer would like to see some eps from the mid-80s, as well! :-)",1207872000,3,1813,4.767515923566879

The early episodes from the Bill Cullen years were neat to see; especially since one of them featured a neighbor of ours from my home town.  I never expected one of her episodes would be included.  I had heard about it all my life.  What a surprise.  Bob Barker's humor with the contestants is priceless.  I laughed so hard watching these shows.  Only 26 episodes out of over 6000 must have been hard to choose from, but I am glad there are a lot from 1972-1975.

3311198,4,B00125JPN0,"This four-disc DVD is tremendous. We get the roots of the show with Bill Cullen and the black haired Bob Barker from his early episodes. Tremendous! Seeing '70s celebrities like Charles Nelson Reilly and Bert Convy help plug the show's expansion into one-hour is fun.
While there aren't as many games in the early Barker years (get ready for a lot of ""The Grocery Game""), it's still a lot of fun to watch. I get a kick out of seeing cars that cost $2-4,000 and seeing Johnny Olsen acting in the Showcase Showdown.
One drawback is the selection of episodes. The Barker era skips from 1972-1975 time period to his last week in 2007. Not on this set are any shows from the 1980s or 1990s. Certainly there are many moments (like Vanna White as a contestant, the lady fainting, the contestant in the bathroom etc.) that would be great to see again. Skipping those decades, unfortunately, means Rod Roddy announced shows aren't there.
What is on this set is gold and is well worth the money. What isn't there is worthy of additional ""Best of Price is Right"" volumes. Hopefully the creators of this set will agree.",1206576000,2,1107,4.595959595959596

Call me weird, but for the past 5 years or so I've searched the web for TPIR sites hoping to see early episodes of the show. With The Price Is Right being into its 36th continuous year on the air, I never thought I'd see as much as rerun of a previous episode. And now here I am watching a younger, dark-haired Bob Barker being introduced on a 1972 episode of The NEW Price Is Right - and all I can say is WOW!!!!!

It's no wonder The Price Is Right has been on TV for so long. An episode from over 30 years ago is just as exciting as a current episode (before Bob retired, of course). This DVD set is a treasure! It contains 4 episodes of the 1950's and early 1960's shows hosted by Bill Cullen. The rest is all classic Bob Barker shows from 1972, 73, 74, 75 and Bob's entire final week as host. You also get the very first hour-long show with the Showcase Showdown. All the famous pricing games and memorable contestants are here as well as the opening cards and ticket plugs.

3311200,4,B00125JPN0,"There is no doubt about it, when it comes down to game shows, The Price Is Right has remained as the only constant on television, while many other game shows have came and gone. But, that doesn't mean that The Price is Right remained the same. It still has shown for over 35 years on CBS, that the show still is as popular as ever. This past year, comedian and host of The Power Of 10, Drew Carey took over the reigns as the host, while the original legend, Bob Barker, retired after an astronomical 50 years on television. But, now the game show is finally making it on the DVD makret. After other game shows from the Mark Goodson Productions catalog have dominated the past few years like Match Game with Gene Rayburn, and the recently released All-Star Family Feud with their original host Richard Dawson made it to home video, how does The Price Is Right stand out, here is the actual retail price.

The Best Of The Price Is Right is a 4 disc DVD that showcase some of The Price Is Right's beginnings and ends of a generation with Bob Barker. The compilation primarily focuses in on the CBS game shows first and last shows Bob hosted. The collection includes the very few shows when Bob hosted the show back in 1972, when they first offered cars like a Chevrolet Vega worth $2,746, all the way to his final week of shows from June 11th - June 15th 2007. The shows have all been remastered from top to bottom. But, Bob isn't the only person as host on this DVD set, as an added bonus for original fans, the collection features very rare episodes of the very first version of The Price Is Right with Bill Cullen all the way back in the 50's and 60's when it was on NBC. Those shows mark a rare treat for what influenced the long-running game show, and what has delivered for so many years.

While there are a lot of Price Is Right fans that feel very dissapointed that there are so many episodes that haven't made it to DVD, The Best Of The Price Is Right works as a great sampler for die hard Price Is Right fans, and for anyone who hasn't even yet seen a glimpse of Bob Barker saying to help control the pet population. All that I can hope for is that there is more one volume of this great game show on home video sometime soon. That price should be right without going over.

But the episodes from 1972 to 1975 are fantastic fun to see . It is well worth the bargin price to see these  vintage 70's episodes and the quality is perfect. It looks like they filmed it yesterday! The very cool retro prizes like a 73 VW, 70's clothes and hairdos are loads of fun and laughs! Bob Barker was always so handsome and smooth, it's fun seeing him in the beginning. He always had the magic touch. I do miss hearing him say ""Have your pets spayed and neutered."" Long time beautiful prize model Janis Pennington who was a 1971 Playboy Playmate, was there from the start.  Maybe someday they will release a bigger collection with more episodes from the late 70's and early 80's to the late 80s on DVD with all the crazy contestents, but for now this is fun to see.

3311223,2,B00125JPN0,"I was very disapointed in this dvd.  I was thinking it would contain moments that have become icons of the show itself.  I find it very boring and repetive.  I have been a fan of the show since I was old enough to watch it.  I was hoping to see clips of memorable moments.  As far as needs improvements goes, it would have been nice to see bloopers, outtakes, mishaps, or decent, but unusal things that happened from time.  I can recall situations like 5 zeros int Plinko game; a key getting stuck the lock durning Master Key; a lady landing flat on her back after trying to spin the big wheel, and even a contestant fainting after being told she won her showcase.  None of this was included.  I was thinking that Bob Barker might appear introducing the episodes and perhaps commenting and remincing.  A special tribute to Johnny Olson would have been nice also.  Afterall, he made the show's trademark expression ""Come on down,""  for ever famous.  This is little more than a panaroma of shows.  The only thing I find special is the final DVD which contains Bob Barker's last week.  Finnaly, we get to see The Price is Right that we came to know and love.  I would not recomend anyone spending money on this.",1313971200,4,1208,4.4520547945205475

Discs 2 and 4 are locked in under discs 1 and 3 and I found it annoying and more of a hastle to unlock that it should be.  I ended up digging out a pair of pliers and breaking off a couple of the tabs so it wouldn't lock shut.  There also isn't enough of a variety of episodes.  The first 3 discs contain episodes from 1972 thru 1975 and the 4th disc contains Bob Barker's final week from 2007.  That's quite a jump in the timeline.  There are zero episodes from the 80's and zero episodes from the 90's.  That means there are no episodes featuring Rod Roddy as the announcer, which was very disappointing to me.  So after you buy this set, go to youtube and download some of the Price is Right episodes that have been uploaded there.  Then you will have a more complete history and timeline of this classic show.",1302998400,3,991,4.141361256544503

Had I been putting together this set, I would have included the CBS Night Time Price Is Right Tribute To Bob Barker, maybe some of the Million Dollar Spectulars, and how about special highlight episodes featuring Pricing Games current and retired.

3311237,4,B00125JPN0,"Being a game show fan. I bought this set at Best Buy soon after its release. I had read about what would be on the set, so I wasn't as disappointed with some of the models and decades not being included. I also know why they weren't included, since I read and post regularly on a few web sites. For those not in the know, I'll share:

Very first show is not included - because the very first item up for bids (IUFB) was a FUR COAT. Bob Barker has since become an animal rights activist and wouldn't clear the show, even though BCI, the makers of this collection, agreed to add a disclaimer. I think I have to side with Bob on this - it would be nice to see the show for historical purposes, but it does make him look like a hypocrite.

Missing models and decades - Barker and his beauties have beefs with each other. He admitted to an affair he had with Dian Parkinson, who sued him for $8 million afterwards. Holly Holstrom sued him for unlawful termination when she was fired in 1995 for being overweight. She got money in a settlement that was reportedly in the millions. Janice and Kathleen were let go in 2000, mainly because they testified in Holly's lawsuit against Barker and sided with Holly. They supposedly were paid a severence package in agreement not to sue. The 80s and 90s shows featured all of the models mentioned. Apparently Barker doesn't want to models to get any more money. Janice is featured since she was on from the first show and Diane is on an hour-long show. No Holly or Kathleen in this set.

No Rod Roddy - Bob reportedly got mad at Rod when he (Rod) went to negotiate for himself and the models that their salary for the nighttime specials should be equal to if not more than the daytime show. Bob cut Rod's on-camera time from the show after that. The excuse given was they ""no longer show announcers on camera."" Rod is not featured at all in this collection.

Other than that, the collection shows how the present day TPIR evolved from a friendly, sometimes unpolished show to the slick and smooth show it is today, with Barker's last week included. The Bill Cullen shows are a great treat as well. Yes, there was a TPIR back in the 50s and 60s, and the Cullen shows prove it. Plus to hear Johnny O say ""Come on down"" once again. He's the one who made that phrase famous.",1255910400,34,2305,4.341067285382831
3311238,4,B00125JPN0,"The earlier black and white shows (with Bill Cullen) are not that good. But the ones with Bob Barker are great. Looking at what the fashion and hairstyles were like back then is outrageous. The prices of the prizes back then will make you sick. One example: A BRAND NEW 1973 CORVETTE STINGRAY was selling for $6,950.....",1255564800,5,320,4.631578947368421
3311239,5,B00125JPN0,"Firstly, I'd like to agree with previous reviews that this isn't really a ""Best Of"" compilation, but I think much of the criticism is overly harsh, with some reviewers giving this a one star rating. My guess is that the title, ""Best of Price is Right,"" was chosen for lack of a better name. The episodes do seem to be fairly random, and while I'm not sure the reason for this, I doubt ""Random Episodes of the Price is Right's Early Years"" would have had a nice ring to it. I also doubt we could all agree on which episodes are the ""best"", so pleasing everyone would be impossible.

However, what you do get is worth every penny:

The first disc contains mostly episodes from the original 1950s series (i.e. pre-Bob Barker days), and while I didn't expect much going in, I have to admit these early episodes have a certain charm. They also provide a good comparison / contrast to the more familiar series we all know and love.

The second and third discs contain episodes from 1972 (the first season) to 1975. It would have been nice to have the very first episode included in this set, but you get a good sampling, none the less. It's interesting to see the very early episodes where many of the seats were empty and mistakes and malfunctions in the equipment are common. As time progressed, audience attendance increased and new games are added... and some games (like the unwinnable bullseye game) are dropped.

The fourth disc contains episodes from Bob Barker's final week on the show. I haven't watched this disc yet, but I'm looking forward to it since I missed these when they originally aired.

Having grown up watching TPIR (since the early 1980s anyway), I'm excited to be able to own ANY of the early episodes in a long-lasting, high-quality format. Until now, the only way I could relive some of the early material was via low-quality chopped-up scenes featured on YouTube.

I sincerly hope this won't be the last of these sets. I would LOVE to see more episodes from the 1970s and early 1980s! Sadly, I have a feeling there are no plans in the works to do this.

PS. It's great to look back at the products and prizes on the show and know in those days they were all MADE IN AMERICA!!!",1253923200,13,2198,4.507537688442211
3311240,2,B00125JPN0,"The DVD set is chock full of early Barker material, as many have mentioned here, which is usually the point of these DVDs. So, if your a fan of that, this should be a good purchase. However, being more a fan of early TV, the first of four discs offers just four shows of the Bill Cullen years, which is sadly not enough. The most interesting part of looking back @ such a show as this is for the history of our economy, specifically our cost of living: boats, cars, Hi Fis, Americana, etc. I've seen the early years on the Game Show Network and it's by far the most fascinating. I mean, this is how we lived in the 50s & 60s!!! However, this is just not the DVD set for that! So, beware!!!",1245628800,3,689,4.111111111111111

Others, who were born way after the CBS show began, think the Bill Cullen shows shouldn't have been included (""It's not in color!..."" ""it doesn't have pricing games!..."" ""the contestants aren't crazy!..."" ""we can't psychoanalyze the lettering font in a game display!""). Cry me a river, all of you. Cullen's show was TV's top game in its day and Barker's version probably wouldn't have made it on the air without it paving the way. As for the selection of Barker episodes, let it stand as a testament, a litmus test, of how it started as a ""Let's Make A Deal"" ripoff and became TV's longest running game.

3311247,4,B00125JPN0,"I am glad this came out, and I would recommend buying it, but it was not as large or as well-produced as expected. Overall, it feels hurried (the DVD menu is awful), and not as good as the Match Game DVD set.
The first disc is devoted to the Bill Cullen TPIR, which is interesting, but I expected it to be like the Match Game DVD set, which only had one episode of its original run. Discs two and three encompass The [New] Price Is Right from 1972 to 1976. Disc four is Barker's last week on the show.
Yes, 2 and 3 feature an awful lot of the Grocery Game and One Right Price, but all the episodes on these discs feature interesting contestants other than the tubetop lady. Also, these discs feature two rare TPIR celebrity appearances: Bert Convy (host of Tattletales) and Charles Nelson Reilly (Match Game panelist).
The video quality is stunning (on par with the Match Game set), but the audio is a bit soft. The DVD packaging is almost there: it is hard to read some of the text, but captures the overall feeling. The liner notes pamphlet is loose (not in a pocket), so it is difficult to reinsert the DVD folder into the slipcase. And it's hard to see the disc numbers. Liner notes are from Golden-Road.net (a fan site), which is surprising, but could have used some editing. On the other hand, I'm glad to see the hard work of fans acknowleged rather than fought, so thumbs up to Fremantle for that!
The biggest disappointment is that there's not one moment from the 80s or 90s. I would have thought that the first episode with Plinko in 1982 would have been on there, or that the first episode with Cliff Hangers would have been on there, or Johnny Olsen's last episode, etc. No Rod Roddy and his sparkly jackets either. No ""reach into my pocket"" for the perfect One Bid bonus. No split-screen with the wheel. Few skit-based showcases.
Also, despite what the Amazon ""author"" line says, there's no episodes featuring Doug Davidson or Dennis James (which is probably a good thing.)

3311252,3,B00125JPN0,"As a devotee of the 35 Year ""Price Is Right"" since Day One, I was a bit disappointed in this set, as when I watched, I thought I had missed something.  From Disc 3, you jump from the first Nov 1975 hour show to Disc 4 and the final 5 daytime episodes.  There is a lot missing.

I am grateful to BCI for including 4 episodes of the original ""Price Is Right"" with Bill Cullen, as I grew up on this version.  Glad that a daytime episode and the fantasic more-opulant prize evening editions (giving away new homes) are included, especially the very last nighttime ""Price"" from 1964 where a celebrity was on the panel and played for people in the audience.

I feel that who put this together stayed heavily with the first season in 1972-73.  One rare thing you never see now is a half-filled audience.  I would figure in respect for Bob Barker, the first episode aired is not included, because the first item up for bids was a fur coat.  However, most of the episodes selected always had the first incarnation of the Grocery Game constantly.  Would have liked to have seen more variety.  Inclusion of the original ""Bullseye - 7 Bid"" game for a car, plus the two-contestant version were a must to show.  However, no reference to the current Bullseye game (one of my favorites).  I am glad that the special hour anniversary week that proceeded the conversion to an hour format was included.  The original wheel was a hoot!  Having the official first hour show is also a plus.  What happened to 1976 through May 2007?  If it were possible,  this could have been a 5-disc set.  A full disc of Bill Cullen on Disc 1 depending on how many original Price shows were available (seeing some on Game Show Network during Black & White Nights over the years showed ""some"", but doubt the entire series is available).  Disc 2 should be ""Early Years"" from 1972-75 in the half hour format, with the evolution of the show and several games past and present.
Disc 3 could've been one of the Anniversary Week one-hour shows, the first hour show, then a best of the later 70's hour shows.  Disc 4 representing the 80s, 90s and 2000.  Disc 5 to include 2001 - 2007, with the Bob's 50th in TV Anniversary Special, the 30th Anniversary show taped in Vegas (I was there for that one) and the very last daytime show, vs. the full final week.

Also missing....bonus features.  The only surprise bonus I found was they left in a Beano commercial, as well as advising how to order tickets for the new Drew Carey episodes.  Where was an interview with past contestants you could find?  Bloopers?  Models then and now?  Something on Roger Dobkowitz and his involvement all these years?  Retired games that worked and didn't work (Hurdles for one that always broke down).

If they proceed with a Best Of Volume 2, I hope they include the complete shows with the woman who lost her top coming on down, the woman who won the first Grand game and chased Bob all over the set, the complete show with Ethel who had the dream about Bob in the hayloft, and other gems.  Greatest wins should also be considered with two that come to mind...the closest Showcase bid being $5 from the actual price, and an episode where two woman were $30 and $29 away from the actual price creating a double-showcase winner regardless.  Would be nice to see who the first double-showcase winner was, who the highest scoring Plinko player is, the guy who gave up $5000 on the Punchboard to win $10000 right after, and who was the first highest amount daytime winner ever.

You will like what you see, but it could be better.  This edition looks too much like it was rush released.",1208649600,11,3617,4.498466257668712
3311253,5,B00125JPN0,"I think this dvd is really awesome!!  It has the original shows as they appeared starting in the late 50's, and starting with Bob Barker in the 70's.  Now that this dvd has been released, there is no question about it.  They need to release more of these, and hopefully in the future, a full box set comes out starting with the very first episode September 1972, and each episode goes in order.  I also hope that GSN would create a 2nd channel called ""GSN Classics"" which only involves games shows from the 60's - 70's - 80's.",1208304000,2,526,4.336734693877551
3311254,2,B00125JPN0,"As a long time Price Is Right fan I was eager to see The Best of The Price is Right.  Unfortunately it is not on this dvd set.  I did find the Bill Cullen shows interesting, and those old dark haired Bob shows were entertaining, but a little goes a long way when you are eagerly waiting for the best to begin. I expected to see the Price Is Right that I loved with the beautiful girls Janice, Dian, Holly, and the adorable Johnny.  Those shows aren't anywhere on this dvd set. I was expecting The Best of The Price Is Right but sadly it's not here.",1208217600,26,548,4.102803738317757
3311255,5,B00125JPN0,"Seeing the episodes from the early '70s brings back fond memories.  Obviously with such a long-running show, there should (if this one sells well enough) be a Volume 2, 3, 4, etc.

Remember Bob's first show with white hair? (Oct. 1987)  He said something like, ""If you were watching yesterday, my hair was dark.  Boy, let me tell you, the blind date I had last night ...!""

There are countless moments like that in the vaults.  And I think TPIR's comedic moments are way funnier than 95% of recent sitcoms!",1208217600,,506,4.566666666666666
3311256,4,B00125JPN0,"People looking for episodes of ""The Price Is Right"" representing the 1980s and 1990s will be sorely disappointed, as those eras are not represented on this four-disc set.  But true game-show fans and amateur television historians will absolutely love this set.  It gives a glimpse of the birth of the longest-running game show in history, with games like ""Any Number"" and ""Hi-Lo"" that have become staples, and others like ""Give or Keep"" and ""Bullseye I"" that have passed into history.

Understanding Bob Barker's stance on animal rights, it's a shame that so many episodes likely will not be released until after his death because fur coats were given as prizes.  As much as I respect his stand, it also deprives game-show lovers of valuable segments of history.  But to see the show in half-hour format brings back memories for me, because I'm old enough to remember the show before it expanded to an hour.",1208044800,,907,4.863636363636363
3311257,1,B00125JPN0,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I ordered this because it said it is The Best of the Price is Right and what I got was a bunch of old shows from before I was even born.  Where's the stuff with the Price is Right with Johnny Olson and Janice and Holly and Diane and Rod?  I ended up fast forwarding through most of it looking for anything familiar.  The name is misleading.  Definitly NOT WORTH $40 and the hassel of returning it!,1208044800,9,418,4.2405063291139244
3311258,4,B00125JPN0,"A huge shout-out to the folks at Fremantle Media and BCI for FINALLY bringing one of my all-time favorite Goodson-Todman game shows to DVD!

The episodes contained in this collection are priceless indeed - starting with the four black-and-white shows with the beloved Bill Cullen, right through the early episodes (great trip down memory lane when contestants were attired nicely).

For me there were a couple of drawbacks - great to see Bob Barker's final week included, but disappointed that no episodes from the 1980s and 1990s are represented.  Also, it would have been extra nice to include special tributes to two men who preceded Rich Fields in the announcer's podium - the sorely missed Johnny Olson and Rod Roddy.

Overall, the packaging is superb.  Let's see more in the future!!!",1207958400,3,790,5.0
3311259,5,B00125JPN0,"Few game shows have managed the popularity and endurance of TPiR, and this DVD set has been long-awaited for fans like me. Highlights include:

- 3 shows from the very first week, featuring the short-lived ""Bullseye I"" game (unfortunately, the premiere is not among them, since BCI was unable to compromise w/Barker over a fur coat being a prize in said ep)
- A 1972 episode w/the equally short-lived ""Double Bullseye"" (the only 2-player pricing game in TPiR's history, and thus the only one that ever guaranteed a win)
- A show from the 3rd anniversary week, where the hour format is first tried (featuring a completely different Showcase Showdown wheel!)
- The first permanent hour show
- 4 eps of the Bill Cullen version
- Barker's entire final week

And much like BCI's earlier GS compilations (Match Game and All-Star Family Feud), all fee/ticket plugs are included for each ep, but this collection also includes something neither of the earlier 2 did: production slates! Nothing huge, but def cool to see and a nice little added bonus.

My only complaint is over the inclusion of Barker's farewell week...yes, his last show should be on there, but I see no reason to include the rest of that week, especially considering there was no mention of the fact during those first 4 eps. If they wanted something more recent, why not one of the primetime anniversary shows, or Barker's final primetime show that saluted his TV career? But I understand that this collection had to be assembled w/Barker's approval, so it's not really a big deal and still a must-have for any game show/TPiR fan out there, and I hope it's the first of several volumes...there's still another 30+ years worth of shows waiting to be represented, and I'm sure the 1-star reviewer would like to see some eps from the mid-80s, as well! :-)",1207872000,3,1813,4.767515923566879
3311260,1,B00125JPN0,"""The Best of the Price is Right""???  HARDLY!  I bought this collection for my kids who grew up watching The Price Is Right but not one of the shows from their childhood are on it. It's only old shows from the early seventies and before.  I'm returning it tomorrow.  I think if you are a game show enthusiast and you think that really old episodes and the black and white years of Pirce is Right are ""the best"" then this would be interesting to you.  Otherwise it's like watching a really long PBS documentary on the early days of tv gameshows...BORING!.",1207699200,7,553,4.435643564356436

From the avocado green appliances to the crushed gold furniture and the orange shag carpet to the punch and spin cash register, it doesn't get any better. I love seeing the prices back then...99 cents for a pound of bacon when I just paid $7.00 at the store!  I thought the shows with Bill Cullen were a hoot, too.  They actually gave away homes as prizes. Just hearing the opening jingle for TPIR takes me back to the 80's when I had young children at home and it was a weekday event at 10am.  Maybe they weren't the ""good old days"", but they were certainly better than what we have now.
