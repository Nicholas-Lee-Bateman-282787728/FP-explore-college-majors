935287,4,6304836511,"This presents a very comprehensive view of Johnson's life and political career. If I find fault, it is the way Johnson's management of the Vietnama War is handled. We are shown how Johnson supposedly backed himself into a corner with the war, but little context is provided. It's seems clear to me the producers were liberal. They make it seem that all Johnson had to do to end the war was recall our military. Simple enough military tactic - not so simple a stategic tactic in the context of the Cold War. In contrast, the producers give considerable context to Johnson's management of civil rights issuses, of course favoring minorities.",1169424000,3,639,4.818181818181818

935289,5,6304836511,"From the time Lyndon Johnson left office in 1969 until the
time this film was made in 1990, his reputation was very
negative:  the heartless war-monger and the sleazy wheeler-dealer.  However, in the 1980's historians, prominent among them
Robert Dallek, had begun to bring out a more balanced, nuanced view of the man.  These historians, whose views appear in this film marked a turning point in the public's view of this most complicated man.  Long-time associate John Connally points out that he could be compassionate and cruel, crude or charming, generous or selfish.  These different traits are constantly brought to the fore by the many people close to LBJ who appear in the film.  Various important points that come out are:
(1)  The breakthroughs in Civil Rights in the 1950's and 1960's were largely due to his efforts.  As a Southerner he was able to get whites in the south to accept desegregation without a large-scale white backlash.
(2)  The controversial senatorial election in 1948 which LBJ won by 87 votes with the help of ballot-box stuffing was hardly unusual in Texas or other parts of the country.  Johnson was not involved personally in the incident. Although it is said that ""Landslide Lyndon""'s career was stained by it, the same could be said of Harry Truman who was also elected in a similar way in 1934, and yet he managed to shake loose of the allegations.
(3)  LBJ was well aware of the risks he was taking in committing
US ground forces to Vietnam.  I was stunned when former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford states in the film that any other President would have taken the same decision. The military and CIA quite accurately laid out the risks to the President in 1965, and LBJ accurately predicted to aide George Reedy at the time that Vietnam would be his downfall.
(4)  LBJ played an vital role in reassuring the country after the assassination of President Kennedy and prevented the outbreak of an anti-Communist hysteria due to the Communist connections of assassin Lee Oswald which might have lead to war with the USSR.

I highly recommend this film for someone who is interested in American history and the country's Presidents.",1110412800,12,2169,4.858695652173913
935290,4,6304836511,"PBS' ""American Experience"" has become synonomous with quality television, and its profile of the country's Vietnam War-embattled president, Lyndon B. Johnson, is one of the reasons why. While Johnson arguably is remembered foremost as the president done in by an unpopular war, he is presented here as a man and politician of much more substance and who apparently did have an honest and compassionate empathy for his constituency, especially the impoverished and disenfranchised. After the obligatory recounting of Johnson's birth and childhood, the documentary takes us to Johnson's early career on Capitol Hill and his gradual ascent to power, starting with his selection as presidential candidate John F. Kennedy's vice presidential running mate. On that count, we get a feeling of a tenuous relationship between the charismatic Bostonian and prairie-tough Texan, a political combination that became even more tenuous by the out-and-out dislike between the eventual vice president and Robert F. Kennedy, brother and attorney general of the president. Of course, the shattering events in Dallas Nov. 22, 1963, vaulted LBJ to the pinnacle of world power, a positioned that was solidifed by a 1964 landslide presidential election victory. From there, LBJ sets off to expand his predecessor's social agenda, from voting rights for the country's disenfranchised minorities to the ""war on poverty."" But, not surprisingly, the unpopular war in Southeast Asia becomes LBJ's highest priority. In the end, of course, the fire of public opposition to both the war and Johnson's handling of it forced the president who just four years earlier was validated by the American people in a landslide victory not to even seek renomination. Though LBJ is perhaps unfairly linked to a presidential administration that was dismantled by civil protest, we are reminded in this profile that he also worked toward a better society for America's poor and disenfranchised. In the end, we actually develop a sense that Johnson was moved more by public service than personal gains of power and can only hope that history treats him kinder than his contemporaries.",1046390400,17,2139,5.369047619047619
935291,5,6304836511,"This video is an absolute must for anybody who is interested in not only contemporary US political history but also in the art of politics itself.  This superbly crafted set of films gives a vivid account of one of the most controversial and, in my opinion, underated US Presidents.
LBJ was a Conservative Democrat.  LBJ was a liberal Democrat.  LBJ could be the nicest chap you ever met.  LBJ could be a real SOB.  In short - LBJ was full of contradictions.  It is this which is best brought out from both tapes.  This is no narrative history.  It attempts to really get behind the man.
I could go on of course.  However, I would not want to spoil the hours of pure pleasure you are sure to attain with this video.",988588800,11,715,4.356060606060606
935292,5,6304836511,"This is one of the most riveting documentaries made about a U.S. President and certainly the best of the ""American Experience"" series. It illuminates the complex, neurotic, fascinating, flawed and brilliant life  of Lyndon Johnson better than anything ever done. The combination of  interviews and archival footage (including color home movies of Johnson  during the '48 campaign), this brings LBJ more closely into focus.
I have  watched this video dozens of times and it never flags. The haunting musical  score is outstanding, as are the interviews with those who knew, loved and  loathed Johnson. This documentary clearly shows that had if not been for  Vietnam (admittedly, a huge ""what if"") LBJ would have been the  greatest President of the 20th century, after FDR. For anyone with even a  peripheral interest in LBJ or the turbulent 60's, this is a must see.",963273600,12,866,5.085106382978723

Johnson's complexities are developed well and the viewer truly appreciates LBJ's rise from obscurity and the manner in which he did it.  The producers  of the film do a wonderful job of showing Lyndon Johnson's compassion,  drive, wit and charm, along with his other innumerable characteristics, as  he oversees the passage of more landmark legislation than any president  before or since.  The only drawback with the film is the failure to fully  provide an analysis of the impact of all of the Great Society legislation.  On the other hand, the film accurately captures the anguish suffered by LBJ  as he led the country into Vietnam.  This film should be seen by all  Americans and is a gold mine for LBJ enthusiasts like myself.",919209600,7,801,4.895522388059701
935368,5,6304836511,"No American President has probably known such highs and lows during their presidency then Lyndon Johnson, the 36th President of the United States. Not even Richard Nixon, the only President who had to resign from office, had such a swing from success to failure in his term the way LBJ did. During his time in the White House Johnson did so much domestically for the country from the 1964 equal rights bill to his Great Society and declaring war on poverty to creating welfare yet all that would be washed away and forgotten as Johnson would make the mistake of getting drawn into the Vietnam war. As the war dragged on and public support for the war started to fade especially after the Tet offensive of 1968 the legacy that LBJ had hoped the American would remember of him began to crumble away.

The documentary ""American Experience: LBJ"" is an extremely well made and fair look at the life of Lyndon Johnson from his humble beginnings as a young boy growing up in Texas to his passion he would develop for politics to his assent to the Presidency. Made in four parts each part goes into complete detail on that particular point in Johnson's life. Part one covers his life growing up in Texas and early political career first in the house and then his eventual election to the senate in 1947 by the slimmest of margin under suspicious circumstances to his run for the Presidency in 1960. Johnson wouldn't get the Democratic nomination in 1960 losing it the young Senator John Kennedy. Kennedy though knew he needed to carry the south to have a chance to win the election and decided to ask Johnson to be his running mate. The first part ends with that fateful day in Dallas in 1963 when an assassin's bullets would suddenly put Johnson as head of the country.

Part two looks at Johnson's term as President from 1963 to election day 1964. During this time Johnson would do all he could to promote the John Kennedy legacy by doing everything he could to get the Equal Rights Act of 1964 passed, a bill Kennedy had tried to get passed but faced stern opposition to, especially in the south. But what Kennedy lacked in political knowhow to force congress to pass the bill Johnson had. HIs years in the Senate taught him how to cajole, bully, flatter, or when need be just plain intimidate anyone to come around to his way of thinking. And now that he was in the White House he used all those experiences to get his way and get the 1964 act passed. et all the while there was one thing in the back of Johnson's mind. The fact he was President by chance and not by being elected by the people.

Part three picks up with the Presidential race of 1964 between Johnson and the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. It what would become one of the most lopsided victories in American history Johnson won his election to be president by a landslide. As 1965 begins Johnson is shown how he went on a furious pace to get as much legislation passed as he could riding on the wave of popularity he had with the American people. But as all these great accomplishments were being made Johnson would suddenly find his attention being averted to the small southeast Asian country of South Vietnam. Johnson didn't want anything to have to do with what was going on in this area of the world. He was too busy creating the ""Great Society"" he had promised the American people. But with some misinformation and bad decisions on Johnson's part he was slowly at first being dragged into the quagmire of a war that was taking place there.

That is what part four is mostly about. The problems that Johnson was having in Vietnam. There were other things going on at the same time that was causing great problems for the President. Riots were breaking out in black communities in many of the major cities from Detroit to Chicago to Los Angeles and others. Johnson understood the plight of the southern blacks in their struggles for equal rights but he could never really understand that the racial struggles of the urban blacks. In the middle of all this the country was beginning to split apart. Then in February 1968 the Tet Offensive took place in South Vietnam. For years Johnson was assuring the public that we were winning the war in Vietnam. That it was only a matter time until we won the war. That we were in complete control. Only Tet showed we really weren't in control. The ironic thing in the whole situation was Tet would be a failure for the North Vietnamese militarily. But the damage was still done the Lyndon Johnson's Presidency. He was losing credibility with the American public. That would spell the end for the Johnson administration when in March 1968 he announced he would neither seek nor accept the nomination for a second term as President.

I thought I knew a lot about Lyndon Johnson but this documentary really showed that I, and I suspect the same for many other Americans, didn't really know as much about the man as I thought I did. ""LBJ"" has made me grow to have a much deeper respect for the man and understanding of his time in the White House. The tragic war that took place a half a world away would come to make Americans look unfavorably on Johnson but in truth the laws and programs that Johnson created back in the mid-60s for the country still are in effect today and are helping all Americans live better lives. I really recommend this DVD to anyone to watch.

935372,5,6304836511,"This doc was well made.  Very well made.
Now, there is not enought time in 1000 hours of DVD to document or explain LBJ.
One thing for sure, Like him or hate him, he was big.  Bigger than most.
From what I have learned, he was probably the most Politically Powerful man every to
be in any leadership  position ever in America.
House, Senate and WH, he took charge and ran it his way or the Highway.
Before he was Senage Majority leader, the Senate sat there all day and did nothing but rubber stamp
everything.  A club of Lazy do-nothing old men.
When he took over, they actually had to work for their pay. He made the Senate a powerful part of Government again.
Since he left, it all fell apart to the extent that it is back to doing absolutely nothing again.
If he came back today, Harry Reid would piss down both legs he would be so scared.
He was harsh, but grown men lived in 24 hour fear of him.  He may have been bad in so many ways, but he did provide one thing that we don not have today, Leadership.
This documentary just touches on that, but in a very entertaining way.
If people want to see the real LBJ and learn how freightning he was to others, you must rent or purchase his
White House recordings.  Scary, enlightning, and even funny at times.
Most of all they are eye-opening.

I would point to this DVD as and really great overal general view of him.",1359676800,3,1368,4.218390804597701

935374,5,6304836511,"LBJ evokes strong reactions among Americans.  On the one hand, he helped remake America by passing some of the most important domestic legislation in the nation's history.  Although the documentary doesn't state this explicitly, LBJ pushed through more legislation than any president in American history except for FDR.  It wasn't just quantity, it was quality.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the perhaps even more important Voting Rights Act of 1965 as well as the creation of Medicare and Headstart and a host of other superb programs that have helped remake America.  On the other hand, there was Vietnam.  What is even more heartbreaking about the tragedy of that stupid little war was that LBJ felt pretty much like the war protesters did.  If you listen to the Johnson White House tapes he says all the things about the war that we now understand about the war.  He knew that losing there would not lead to Communist victories elsewhere.  He didn't see that we could win there or how we could win.  But he also felt that political exigencies made it impossible not to prosecute the war there.  And to be honest, given the political climate of the time, it is hard to see how he could have done other than what he did.  The overwhelming belief at the time was that you had to meet perceived Communist aggressive wherever possible with complete opposition.  Nevermind that the Vietnamese people overwhelmingly wanted to be a unified nation under Ho Chi Minh, who was the most popular person in the southern part of the nation as well as the North.  The brute fact is that the only way we could have ""won"" the war would have been to kill off about 80% of the population.  You simply never, ever can win a war where most of the population favors the other side.  And LBJ eventually came to realize this, even while he couldn't figure out a way of extricating the U.S. from the war.

LBJ was fascinating for the strength of his personality and his skills as a political operative.  His abilities to persuade others is legendary.  Like Nixon he lived constantly with an inferiority complex and sought affirmation from others, interpreting political victories as love for him as a person.  The documentary does a decent but not complete job at getting at the complexities of Johnson's personality.  It also fails to do justice to some of his personal convictions.  For instance, he had long worked for the rights of non-Anglos in Texas, working hard for Hispanics.  He did play along with many of the racist Southern senators, but this was political expediency rather than personal conviction.

LBJ's legacy is a strange one.  He is usually ranked just below the group of the greatest American presidents at the top.  Despite Vietnam he is easily, with no serious competition, ranked as the greatest American president since Truman, being ranked just below people like Wilson and Jefferson, at about the same place as Polk.  Where would he have been ranked without Vietnam?  I suspect he would be up there with Teddy Roosevelt, just behind the Big Three of Lincoln, FDR, and Washington.  As it is, there is Vietnam.  Never in American history did one particular event so devastate and nearly negate all the other amazing things that any American president achieved.  A great documentary, even though it barely scratches the surface of the enigma that was LBJ.",1263859200,3,3361,4.803135888501743

This was pivotal. We live in its fragmented shadow. Thinking of today, and the laudatory things said for some supposed, imaginary Dealmaker-in-Chief: LBJ was THE archetype of this, at least in terms of getting more people to agree his preferences in the rush to pass around other-peoples'-money. The problem was, the economic pie didn't keep up with his hopes, and especially, his mouth. And as is shown, a politician too attached to being loved might want to tell a rosier story that is quickly exposed by harder realities. Yes, there are moving moments here about his major accomplishments in uplifting the lives of many. But tossing the Vietnam war on top of the War on Poverty with an insufficient eye on the budget broke both, in a way. Watch here as LBJ seems to dissolve under the strains, before one's eyes. This is really the moment when red and blue split, not Nixon's clever uptake on that, via Nixon's Southern Strategy.

The documentary is long enough - about 4 hours - to provide great insights into LBJ without getting bogged down in details, while giving viewers enough information for them to learn something new. I was particularly interested in the second part of the documentary, which covers LBJ's presidency after the 4th (and currently last, as of this writing) volume of Robert Caro's biography of LBJ ends. Caro is also interviewed here, as is Doris Kearns Goodwin. The end of the documentary is heart-wrenching. We see how far LBJ has fallen, how tormented he is by what is happening in Vietnam - the failure of his dealmaking skills to apply to foreign policy, the American boys he sent to their death. I wish he had lived long enough at least to see Watergate and Nixon's resignation, but he seems to have been waiting for his own death from the moment he left the White House. He wanted to do so much for the country through the Great Society and he did do a lot but he fell short of what could have been. Contrary to Richard Nixon, who comes across as a profoundly flawed man mainly interested in his own power, LBJ wanted to improve society and so his downfall is rather tragic and heartbreaking.
