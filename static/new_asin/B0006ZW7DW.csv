2197867,3,B0006ZW7DW,"As far as the quality of the film, the characters and the acting ....... excellent. True Indie type quality where the talents of the actors, cinematographers, director etc are the instruments that make a good film not the money and effects.

*** Spoiler alert ***

The plot revolves around an aging artist, Julius Morlang who, for all his faults, is deeply buried within himself. His wife of 15 years cannot get through to him and eventually has a an affair with a young and upwardly mobile artist named Jansen. To provoke emotion from Julius, she gave him many chances to stop her going to see Jansen. Morlang, chose to let her go.

Morlang follows her to Jansen's studio and sees his wife and Jansen locked in the embrace of pure passion. Morlang's heart now broken and deep in rage at his wife retreats further into himself. Shortly after Morlang's wife is diagnosed with a brain tumor that leaves her but weeks to live. She and Julius agree on a suicide pact. Julius, prepares the potion and, unbeknown to him, his wife makes a Video tape and mails it to Jansen telling Jansen whats going on and that she and Julius have decided to commit suicide together. However, Julius only serves his wife the potion and she dies alone.

Now, the twist, prior to his wife's suicide, Julius had received news that the tumor his wife has could, and, more likely is, benign. He doesn't give this news to his wife but continues to serve her the potion. Jansen receives the tape and decides to stalk and eventually ruin Morlang as, Morlang deceived his wife into taking her own life.

It fell short at the end for me as, I couldn't make the pieces fit well enough to justify Jansen's actions. Had, on the other hand, Jansen known about the good news NOT delivered to Morlang's wife, then his actions would have been justified and more acceptable.

Still, an excellent movie, well acted, well presented and totally believable in the plot but, as mentioned, for me, a little short at the end.",1317686400,4,1977,4.618233618233618
2197868,5,B0006ZW7DW,"Set against the beautiful shores of Ireland and downtown Rotterdam, the film's title character Julius Morlang is a successful artist, torn between the two women in his life. Through flashbacks, past and present are slowly uncovered to those around him.

2197869,5,B0006ZW7DW,"Dark and subtly woven, this artistic portrayal of an actual event deserves every accolade it's received, plus some.  Rich and lush in its imagery, short in dialogue yet long in emotion, this film explores the vast landscape of aging and middle-aged love in all their permutations.  Betrayal begets heartbreak and supressed fury as both artist and muse struggle through the treacherous hills and valleys of reconciliation.  Its masterful conclusion leaves viewers grappling with the ultimate dilemma of ""what would I have done?""",1255305600,11,527,5.402439024390244
2197870,1,B0006ZW7DW,"I am not sure, but I think the moviemakers of this movie took all the scene cuts they'd made for the movie, threw them up into the air, then spliced them together as they picked them up and called that their movie.

To try to figure out what was supposed to be happening, I tried looking up the artist in this so-called true story, and could find nothing about him.  So, I didn't have a book to read, or even a magazine article, to see what his life was like.  I'd hoped if I knew a little something about him, I could make heads or tales of this movie.

Therefore, I conclude that this movie if for those types of people who like to read intellectual jibberish and claim they 'understand' it.  Of the more than 4,500 movies in my collection, this one comes in near or even at the bottom in the editing category.

There are way too many good movies out there to waste time on this one.  If you want super-excellent movies also put out by Mongrel Media, watch 'Somersault' or 'Eve & the Firehorses.'",1168128000,3,998,4.276595744680851
2197871,3,B0006ZW7DW,"I hate writing movie reviews, but this time I feel overwhelmingly compelled.

This is the story of struggling ""camera-obscura"" painter Julius Morlang (Paul Freeman) who is also struggling to maintain his marriage to Ellen (Diana Kent), who has cheated on Julius with a rival artist, and the fact that Ellen gets diagnosed with a malignant tumor doesn't make things any better.

But, of course, these events are revealed to us out of order along the lines of 21 Grams and Memento, but failed to maintain my suspense and interest like those films did.

Instead, the film introduces us to Julius's girlfriend Ann (Susan Lynch) before revealing what happens to Ellen, and switches between past and present (I think) to confuse us on purpose. The first 40 minutes or so plays out like a ghost story or haunted house yarn, and probably would've been more entertaining if it had played up the supernatural angle (my opinion), but then we find out what's really going on and I had to ask the question ""...and? So? That's it?""

I was able to figure out why Julius was going out of his mind with guilt, and if they had, maybe, focused more on the ""pact"" he makes and its sinister outcome and put it earlier in the story I probably would've fallen in love with this movie, but it's held off until the third act as some kind of a twist that doesn't work without the proper setup (the scene of Julius waiting between the beach rocks could've been the best scene of the movie if handled correctly).

There is, however, a very chilling Hitchcockian scene late in this film that involves a message left on an answering machine and the removal of said message, but that's about it.

I realize this is supposed to be more of a ""psychological"" thriller, and where the film is well-acted and does contain some beautiful and interesting shots, director Tjebbo Penning either didn't want to or doesn't know how to tell this kind of a story (with the time-jumping) in the correct way so that we know just enough to understand what's going on and want to continue watching.",1125187200,9,2049,4.6464088397790055

It is also the sort of ending that can be discussed over and over. I would love to give away the key elements in place for this film, but there is no way to do it without spoilers.

Not a film to watch unless one is paying close attention to everything. I know that near the ending, I was a bit worn on patience with the exasperating feel of ""what is taking so long?"" and then the stunning conclusion in the aftermath is revealed and it changes everything I perceived going in.

2197879,3,B0006ZW7DW,"Morlang is one of those films that are difficult to figure out, is this a thriller, a mystery, a murder, has a crime been committed? By the end of the film I was just as confused. However, the main protagonist was so unlikable by that time, I did not care.

Julius Morlang, is played by Paul Freeman. He is a British artist who comes into and out of vogue throughout this film. I think this is one of his issues, he has to be on center stage with an adoring crowd. In this film, Morlang has been married to his wife for 15 years when she has an affair. This is something he cannot abide, and he is devastated. At the same time she gives him news that he cannot bear to hear. Throughout this film, we move from his first marriage to his second. This film takes a long time to make its point. It is not until the last five minutes that we understand what has taken place. What a mess, as Betty Davis would say.

I like a mystery and a thriller, but not one that is so confusing and takes 90 minutes to figure the plot line.

I found this was inspired by a news story. OK, but the love story misses love. The final image of Ellen as the topic of Morlang's art make a mockery of it. The Passion Ellen shares briefly with Robert could not have been a reason for Robert to haunt Morlang over. It is an artificial tool to show Morlang how he's done wrong. Robert didn't know about the misdiagnosis. Morlang's 15 years of marriage with Ellen brought him to want to kill himself with her, then willing to kill her for the affair, we are told. We accept because we heard this before. That's not how love works, and the loving art images at the end contradict it.

I knew love. If I found my mate betrayed me I would have been devastated - but giving up on love is like giving up on color to go back to a black and white world, and Morlang goes back and forth too quickly to be believable.",1481587200,3,950,4.301675977653631

So, maybe it was the murder or maybe the treachery and not woman #3 that did the trick for him. Who cares?

When a particular important detail was revealed, I actually jumped up off the couch in disbelief.  Of course, that key information eventually led to the answers to all the mounting questions I had.  In several emotion-filled vignettes with no dialogue necessary, the entire story was revealed.  I think I sat still for several minutes, unable to move, trying to absorb what I had just witnessed.  I'm still in a state of shock.  Watch this movie when you have an extra hour and a half--don't fold laundry, wander around, or leave the TV.

I liked the actors and scenery. Very nice all the way around.

The reason I gave this movie three stars is because I liked it despite the fact that it made little sense. I kept hoping it would make more sense as the movie went forward but it never did.

Time dances with foreshadow and flashback, in typical Scandinavian fashion.  Tape, film, looping reels, recording and re-playing all provide additional fodder for the dualists.  Notice, most of the action takes place in the light of day.  My recommendation:  Do not waste time preparing yourself for an unhappy ending. You'll enjoy the final crescendo.

I had to take the time to call Amazon, explain their own duplicity of advertising as one thing and doing something else.  Eventually, they agreed to credit my account.  If I would have paid for this video, I would have considered it a waste of good money.
PS: The Amazon representative told me that I had to look at a certain page to see what is Prime.  Just because the movie page is marked Prime doesn't mean it is.

Little doubt in my mind that the betrayed husband would not be able to get past his feeling of betrayal i was not aware until it happened how deeply his wife felt about what she described as his passivity. In other words he wasn't agressive enough, or didn't express his feelings in a way that made her feel
That she was truly a part o his life. Her method of demonstrating her dislike was horrific . She made no bones about not only telling him what she did , but how much she enjoyed it. The actions of his wife were unforgivable as the rest of the movie painfully, but effectively shows us  how that effects him. its well made, very  well acted and keeps you totally involved. Its one of my favorite movies. my next comment is a bit of a spoiler alert, so read at your caution
We don't know if his intention truly was to die with his wife. even if we assume that he was, when he learned that she was not going to die, that the diagnosis was in error, he could not accept the possibility of her  renewing her adulterous relationship with his enemy if they returned. he would rather see her dead than to resume that hated relationship that had driven him to near madness.. thats the extreme of jealousy.",1447027200,8,1310,4.317073170731708

The Danes go deep, down to the raw core of human experience, and anytime married love is on the line, pain is for some married people never far away. Some of us had the courage to sign the deal; half of young America refuses to sign these days. The film, then, raises the question about how responsible one may be for another's infidelity. And if one by default or personality ""fails,"" does it justify betrayal? And how much reassurance afterwards does it take to heal the relationship? Or do such relationships never really heal? And how deep  can hate descend and how close to hate is love? All open questions. I know of no such pain in a 50 year marriage but ""Morlang"" takes me as close as I ever want to be.",1441584000,50,846,4.388535031847134

2198359,4,B0006ZW7DW,"Morlang, a Netherlands 2002 Film, in the English language, is based upon a true story of an aging successful artist whose wife Ellen, confesses to an affair.  Julius Morlang, the artist, soon has an affair with a younger woman.  Morlang is also pressured in the art gallery world by his agent for masterpiece work.  Ellen his wife, feeling she is doomed, refuses treatment, and they decided to make a death pact.

This is not one of your typical ""backflash"" movies;  it is more complex than that.  The director has created a confusing story with numerous backflashes interspersed with real time.  If you have trouble figuring out what is going on, it make take a second viewing.

Actor Paul Freeman, who plays Julius Morlang does an excellent job of portraying a man in distress, complete with psychological torment including haunted from the past.  The musical soundtrack fills the moods and the landscaping is beautiful.  The film is widescreen and narrow to the viewing screen. Aside from the scenery and revealing closeups.

Don't give up on this film if confused, it is a compelling story, with a shocking twist, and done quite well.  .....Rizzo",1322179200,17,1150,4.932291666666667
