4075229,2,B00369ERCY,"I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month. Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first, I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original. The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down. The stunts are still impressive, but it just doesn't deliver like the original film. Too bad! :-(",1266710400,8,420,4.2625
4075230,1,B00369ERCY,"If you liked the first one, DO NOT watch this one. The first one was full of kick ass stunts, this one is like a Steven Seagal movie. The second one definitely pussed out, they do slow motion replays, i mean come on.",1265760000,2,216,4.046511627906977
4075231,3,B00369ERCY,"It's an okay movie, mostly a rehash of District B13 with a bigger budget but somehow a smaller vision. The storyline is weak, but with a movie like this, it's really nothing more than scaffolding on which to hang the cool stunts. But that's the strange thing about this movie. Cyril is obviously a fantastic gymnast, martial arts expert, and stunt choreographer, but the simple yet powerful artistry of David Belle's parkour is almost missing entirely. The cinematographer and editor could have taken a few simple cues from the myriad of parkour videos posted on YouTube--you don't cut on the action, you shoot an entire sequence of moves. Belle can jump off a building doing a reverse gainer (even though it's not very efficient), roll out into a dead run, leap over a fence with the ease of an alley cat, and disappear through a window 8 feet off the ground all in one captivating take. He doesn't need ""movie magic."" All he needs are a decent pair of sneakers and a few minutes to think about it. Unfortunately for this movie, some highly difficult maneuvers are cut mid-stream, making it look fake (and some of them clearly are fake). If I want the fake look, I'll rent a Bruce Willis movie. Could someone please capture David Belle on 35mm film without letting their ""artistry"" get in his way?",1262649600,3,1298,4.672489082969432

4075246,2,B00369ERCY,"Although exciting action wise and of course there are the inevitable scenes that make you say ""Really!!"". It was pretty entertaining, where it fell apart for me was it heavy handed social commentary. Which is fine but to go to such great lengths to defend the rights of such miscreants as portrayed here made it difficult to finish. Truth is there are several district's in Paris that are pretty much out of control not far off from what was depicted here. If that sort of thing is not important to you may enjoy this. Otherwise pretty much a waste of your time.",1440806400,,562,4.519607843137255

It is subtitled, but it really is better than listening to a bad dub job.  The storyline is fairly simple. Good cop and good samaritan get together to save a bad neighborhood.  But, in all reality; this type of movie isn't watched for the story.  It's the action.  And this will deliver.",1427155200,,444,4.353658536585366

4075285,1,B00369ERCY,"great action. the political messages ruined the whole movie for me. SPOILER ALERT! Ill give those who don't want to hear the ending a second or 2 to leave. Ok, times up/ Everything was going great until the end where all these bad-ass gangs get together and have a chat with the prez. Because they just saved the entire country he agrees to blow up their ghettos and replace them w nice housing and provide everyone w a job. Everyone knows these people are almost as lazy as the Swiss. They like being on the dole. And whas with the muzzies, skinheads, blacks and all the rest living in harmony after all this? I mean, sci fi is easier to believe than this. But at least we see the logical conclusion of all the crazy liberal policies that France (and the rest of Europe) have implemented. The bad guys have all the guns. Most of the police don't carry because that would make the local gangs angry. The rest of the populace cower in fear because they cannot defend themselves. There is a bit of ironic humor also. France just got angry at Fox News for saying there were no-go zones. The irony here is that even in this PC movie, the director accidently shows us that truth is stranger than fiction",1422316800,,1198,4.400900900900901

4075289,4,B00369ERCY,"Not a great film but not bad at all. I disagree with some of the reviews that stated the ending was contrived. Instead, I found it consistent with the flow and rest of the story. As far as action/fight movies go, it can easily go near the top of the heap. Don't look for it to win any movie awards. Don't make the mistake of watching foreign films with English dubs. I know there are a lot of people who don't like subtitles but the voice acting of the dubbed versions is never on par with the original.

All-in-all, if you're looking for something to occupy your time and you like shoot'em ups with fighting... it's a good choice.",1419379200,,631,4.302521008403361

4075322,4,B00369ERCY,"First off, this isn't the BEST acted film nor the highest budgeted but it is a big step up from the last film which had great heart and imagination but fell through on some of the quality.

The two top billed characters are back (Leto and Damien), and, if anything, Damien has really benefited the most from the time since last movie and has a number of fight sequences that are much better choreographed and the sound design is much less hollow as well as the music being much less simple or repetitive.

The story is predictable, but the characters aren't so you still have a pretty darn satisfying journey ahead of you like a little bit of plot with your action then you get it and a nice little ending that blends well with some of the moral arguments made by the movie.

All in all, it is a good step up from B13 with mostly only improvements to speak of.",1399507200,,860,4.296296296296297

An interesting plot dealing with deception and political machinations (one of the few movies with that theme that I could actually understand it pretty well). Pretty well-balanced, at least in my opinion. And, overall, worth checking out.
There's not much I could say about it that wouldn't ruin plot points and all, yet I didn't see the first movie, though I did enjoy how this one went.
So, the best I could do is a recommendation: if you like fast action, a great-paced movie, a foreign film, numerous twists and deep thought to the twists, and realistic fight scenes, and an eventual cast of eccentric people (including a woman who knows how to fight with her hair as a deadly whip) in the mix and a surprise twist at the end, this could definitely be for you.",1368144000,,886,4.649681528662421

As with the original, this has some amazing, almost balletic stunts
clearly done by the actors themselves, who are in this case two of the
originators and developers of the sport called parkour, which involves
scrambling and leaping around the urban landscape, jumping up and over
cars, out of 2nd floor windows, across rooftops.

In this age of CGI and wire assisted stunts, it's wonderful to watch
real human beings doing amazing, acrobatic things.

I also liked that the film had an interesting element of social satire
which made it smarter and more political than most of the action
blockbusters we get from Hollywood.

That said, sadly it did eventually burn out for me, on both the action
and the plot front. For the first half I thought this would end up one
of my all time favorite action pics. But the story logic gets stretched
further and further, and by the end the clever political set up turns a
bit silly, while some of the action starts to feel a bit repetitive.
Still, I'm glad I saw, and enjoyed it. I just doubt it's a film I'd
buy, or return to again.

4075385,3,B00369ERCY,"While the original ""District B13"" (2004) was not exactly intelligent and had some serious flaws in the action department (yep, editing) it was enjoyable enough that I looked forward to this sequel.  While it's not awful, ""D13: Ultimatum"" (Where's the ""B""?) captures the same stupidity with increased style and a decrease in substance and enthusiasm.  Oh, and unfortunately, less Lola (Dany Verissimo-Petit), too.

3 years after the first film, the quarantined Paris neighborhood known as D13 is pretty much the same, despite the political agreement that earmarked the ghetto for financial and occupational resurrection.  D13's local boyscout, Leito (David Belle, ""Babylon A.D.""), spends his time blowing holes in the wall that separates them from the rest of the city, hoping to expedite the process of legally taking it down.  Meanwhile super-cop Damien (Cyril Raffaelli, ""Kiss of the Dragon"") is resting easy after taking down a drug-kingpin when he's suddenly arrested on narcotics possession charges.  Before he can call Leito to casually request assistance with his jail-break, Leito inadvertantly discovers the same scheme (via crooked cops) to destroy/re-build D13 that incarcerated Damien to begin with.  Can Leito break him out of the clink in time to save their beloved slum?

In the first film, the Parkour scenes looked excellent while the fist-fights were horribly choppy.  The first 45 minutes of this one looked to reverse those two action elements with slightly better fights and much worse Parkour.  That is until the fights gradually sink even lower than those of the 1st flick.  As dumb as the early fight that Damien has while holding a priceless Van Gogh painting is, it's decent, with a couple of ""whoa!"" moments scattered throughout its duration.  By the time Damien fights a group of cops in the police plaza, what little tolerable camerawork we had earlier is gone.  Not only one of the worst examples of ""one-at-a-time"" choreography I've ever seen but when the fight is not shown from directly above the participants' heads, it's all chest-level close-ups.  When you have athleticism at the level of the film's two stars, there should be NO close-ups and minimal (if any) trick editing during action scenes. For crying out loud, David Belle is the inventor of Parkour! Cyril Raffaelli could practically do spin-kicks in a phone booth!  GET THE DAMN CAMERA BACK AND LET THESE PEOPLE DO THEIR THING! That's exactly why this film didn't star the likes of Jean Reno and Gerard Depardieu!

On yet another action complaint, the much-heralded fight with female gang-boss Tao (Elodie Yung, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"") taking out 5 cops is much ado about nothing.  All slow-motion and, again, one-at-a-time.  Oh, she's cute but so what?  As a heterosexual (really, I swear!) male I have NEVER watched a girl kick butt because it looked sexy.  Though they may provide some eye-candy during slow stretches, I watch Angela Mao, Gina Carano, JeeJa Yanin, Kara Hui, Cynthia Rothrock, Michelle Yeoh, etc. for the same reason I watch dudes kick butt: I enjoy good fight scenes, plain and simple.  And on another personal note, I have nothing against tattoos though I do NOT find them attractive at all but I gotta admit that Tao rocks 'em better than any girl I've ever seen!

The Magnet/Magnolia DVD has great widescreen picture quality with languages available in French and English and optional subtitles in French, English and Spanish.  Special features include a Making Of, Production Diary, Deleted/Extended Scenes and HDNet: A Look @ D13U.  If you enjoyed the first film there's a strong possibility you'll enjoy this, too.  I did enjoy the first and this one... is okay.  2.5/5

The problem is they did such a great job with the first one that they needed to reach a bit higher with the second one and didn't achieve this, imo.

What I would recommend is owning both & watching them one after the other since Ultimatum immediately takes off from the first one and resumes the story line.

As a set, I'm glad I have both as it makes for a complete evening's entertainment.

4075401,4,B00369ERCY,"Style over substance. It's easy to dislike a movie or music or book because of this. But what if the movie in question doesn't pretend to have any substance? For my money, that is the case here. This is one, wild, way over the top ride. It's great action, great fight scenes, cool costuming and sets. It's eye candy to the enth degree.

Briefly, there is a government plot to bring down district 13 (sort of a walled in ghetto with its own culturally factioned government) and displace everyone in it. To do so they create a false flag operation by killing cops and trying to make it look as though some of the bad guys in the district did it. Then they need to get a really good cop out of the way so he doesn't dig too deep. So they frame him on false drug charges. The trouble is: The cop on cop murder was caught on video and now the framed cop needs to team up with a ""bad guy"" to bring the evidence to light and thwart the entire mess.

Luc Besson both wrote and produced this and he's nothing if not a stylist. This is shot and edited extremely well. And it's a whole lot of fun. The chase scenes (on foot no less) are choreographed beautifully, as are the fight scenes. It is also replete with a host of colorful characters. The soundtrack isn't the type of music I'd normally choose to listen to but it worked here for me.

As frothy as this is there are some socio-political underpinnings. One of them is a bit on the creepy/conspiracy side. Unfortunately it's not enough to make a true statement but it adds a bit of weight to the proceedings.

4075408,4,B00369ERCY,"In watching DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM, you're subjected to the tired political subtext and also the sometimes ridiculous plot. Writer/producer Luc Besson, historically, hasn't sold heaps of movie tickets by virtue of his having been the voice of social conscience, and his attempts here are awkward. Doesn't matter, though. The first movie rocked it. This sequel rocks it equally. The two stars, David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli, are back for another bone-bruising round of no-wires, no-CG stunts and fight scenes. ""C'est magnifique!"" and also ""Le chat est sur le tableau."" And that's my French.

Three years after what went down in the first film, and the government has changed hands, and yet things remain the same. That barbed wall still stands tall and menacing, still isolates the lawless territory known as District 13 from the more civilized parts of Paris. In the dystopian near future of 2016, an uneasy sort of peace exists between law enforcement and the ruling gangs of District 13. But now corrupt cops are intent on stirring things up, on enticing riots, the end game being the razing of these bleak tenements and thus raking in the resulting rewards of suddenly available real estate.

When Leito (Belle), District 13's well-meaning rogue, ends up with evidence incriminating the police, it's only a matter of time before he joins forces again with his old friend Damien Tomasso, the formidable and baldy-domed Army Captain assigned to the police Special Forces. On his end, Damien (Raffaelli) has found himself framed and locked up by his fellow police officers. This tends to happen when you're an honest cop. Leito springs Damien, and away they go, striving to save the barricaded slums and their unsavory populace from extinction.

It's gratifying that Belle and Raffaelli obviously get along and share this sort of macho chemistry, and I really enjoy their interactions. But, really, the story is a vessel for their astounding physicality and athleticism. David Belle demonstrates his skills at parkour, and parkour, by the way, is the art of navigating from point A to point B as expeditiously as possible. And Belle's chase scenes are physically taxing and make for absolutely jaw-dropping stuff. Cyril Raffaelli, who looks like Vin Diesel chopped off at the knees, is himself versed in parkour but he's also a practitioner of Shotokan karate and several wushu styles, and he handles the brunt of the martial arts and he's dynamic. What he does here, in beating down waves of goons, hearkens back to when Jackie Chan was really tearing $#!% up in his heyday. Like Jackie, Cyril incorporates whatever props are handy into his explosive fight scenes. In one sequence, he even fends off a group of thugs with a priceless Van Gogh painting.

As mentioned, plenty of the plotlines go the preposterous route. And maybe the silliest, most ""What the f---?!"" moment is when Cyril Raffaelli, during an undercover ops, disguises himself as a lithe girl dancer, never mind that there's an obvious discrepancy in body types. And, speaking of body types, supporting actress Elodie Yung has got a slender bod and she is memorable as ""Tao,"" head of the Chinese gang and sporting a murderous ponytail. Tao kicks serious behind (but only in two scenes, dammit - one in the actual film and a brief segment in the deleted scenes bonus feature).

DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM, like its predecessor, exhibits great energy and a pounding, hip-hop laced soundtrack. It presents a grungy, gritty atmosphere reminiscent of films like ROAD WARRIOR and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, and there's particular attention paid to depicting that mean urban sprawl. The battered-down edifices (some of which are skyscrapers) provide Belle the ideal venue to show off his crazy leaping, hurdling, scaling abilities. No trickeration, Belle really does his own stunts. As does Cyril Raffaelli. And so does that one poor guy whom Raffaelli drags thru the air one floor down and then slams viciously thru a table. I'll go ahead and speak for that poor guy and say that the pain was worth it. The action sequences are that dizzying and breathtaking.

The DVD's bonus material includes the Making Of featurette (00:26:33 minutes long, with English sub-titles); a production video diary which chronicles the many days of on-location filming (00:34:31); Alonzo's music video ""Dtermin""; Deleted/Extended Scenes include: an extended jailbreak sequence as Leito searches for evidence while Damien holds off the police; even more fight scenes as Leito, Damien, and the gang lords storm the Secret Services stronghold (00:09:22, with English sub-titles); and HDNET: A Look at DISCTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM (00:04:43).",1277078400,13,4666,5.140974967061924

I happened to come across the first District 13 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-B13/dp/B000GPPPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District B13</a>&nbsp;for the first time only a few weeks before this one was relesed on video, so I've watched both recently.  I do like the original better in terms of ""plot,"" but I think the action level is better in this movie.  To the people who rated this movie lower than original - did you see David Belle make the same jump between two buildings I did?  Plus, this movie has the best martial arts fight scene with a kick ass female I've seen in a long time.  I also like the way Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle add diferent types of action to the film- martial arts vs Parkour.  It makes the movies even more exciting because you don't know what to expect next.  Who would have dreamt a Van Gogh could be so deadly?  Even though they have different styles, they seem to inspire each other to new heights (literally).  They have a friendly competition in real life (see the special features on this and the first movie) which works well for the chemistry of the characters in the movie.  In the first movie Davide Belle trained to jump straight through a very small window, the size of which you usually see in a basement in America (or in this case top of a door in France).  Davide Belle and Cyril Raffaelli must have had a bet going because not to be outdone, Cyril Raffaelli did a similar stunt in this movie, but in his own marital arts way.

4075420,4,B00369ERCY,"For those of us who unfortunately have not seen the original BANLIEUE 13 - aka DISTRICT 13 - (made in 2004 with the same crew except for the director - Pierre Morel), some of the background information that usually follows in a sequel is missing and according to many, the sequel here BANLIEUE 13:ULTIMATUM - aka DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM is not as strong a film.  And perhaps that allows the viewer to appreciate fine French film making without the comparison!

Luc Besson (of the Trasnporter series et al) wrote this script (or rather, this plan of choreography, as there is not a lot of spoken dialogue in this fast-paced thriller) and Patrick Allessandrin directs a story of a region of Paris (District 13) that is cordoned off the rest of Paris by a group of five warlords who manage to control the drug ridden violent region.  Basically the tale is that of two men - Captain Damien Tomaso (Cyril Raffaelli) and undercover cop of the 'good' police and Leto (David Belle), an ex-thug who in the previous film infiltrated a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb.  That was supposedly in 2010.  The film opens some years later when District 13 is now in control of power over the government and the 'bad police' are attempting to destroy the area and rebuild according to their greedy plans.  The action is the story and the action is immensely exciting!  David Belle invented a discipline known as Parkour, which consists of moving quickly and efficiently in any environment, using only the abilities of the human body, and though his acting credits are minimal, he is stupefying in his live action role. Belle and Raffaelli are the reasons to watch this thriller as their screen chemistry is magnetic.  Other standout performances in the film include the much tattooed Elodie Yung as Tao (the principal gang queen), Philippe Torreton as the much oppressed President, and the evil appearing Daniel Duval as the nemesis who turns the keys of the plot.

The cinematography is superb, the musical score is French rap music that while it suits the mood of the film becomes irritating in its repetitiveness.  In all this is an escape film that is high on excitement is not very high on intelligent dialogue.  But put Bell and Raffaelli together and the combustion is authentically credible.
