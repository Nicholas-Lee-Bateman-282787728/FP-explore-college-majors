I was delighted to see ""I Like It Like That"" as I had never seen a film featuring Nuyoricans.  This film shows Haitians in the US and that was novel.  However, my praise ends here.
This movie was slow, boring, and gotcha-awful!  What could have fit into a sitcom, commercials included, was stretched painfully into a longer-than-average film.  ""Juno"" could be dialogue intensive because the characters were so witty.  The characters here are repetitive and say much about nothing.  Like me, many will be pressing their fast-forward buttons often.
The film starts with showing two Haitians who said they would never get with another Black person.  I have never met Haitians who were that self-loathing.  I can see Haitians' next-door neighbors being self-loathing and in denial of their Blackness, but not Haitians.  They seem proud.
The main couple here is a light-skinned man and his darker-skinned girlfriend.  Yes, he did have straight hair, but you could still tell he was partially Black.  This film would jump from calling him ""white"" to ""light-skinned"" whenever it was convenient.  I'm an African American and I'd say Mariah Carey doesn't ""look Black.""  However, since Mariah says she is Black, has photos of visibly Black relatives, and promotes Black musical culture, then I and every other African American I know deems her Black.  The light-skinned man here spoke Haitian Creole, had a biological cousin/best friend who was Black, and seemed proud to be Haitian.  It made no sense for the ingenue's father to dismiss him as ""white.""  If I were a betting man, I'd say Haiti has many light-skinned Blacks who other Haitians would never dismiss as being white.  There was no reason for the schism here.  But I would say in life and in art, one rarely sees lighter men with darker women.  Just as I love seeing lighter men with darker sisters on ""The Jeffersons"" and ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,"" I did love seeing it here.
I was told that Haitian Creole is so different from French that it's deemed a separate language.  However, I took many years of high school French and it sure seemed like I was watching a French-language film here.  This made me think that anyone who has studied French in high school could get an easy A if their college offered Haitian Creole.
I love actors of color getting work.  I love ""voices from the bottom"" getting a chance to be heard.  But multi-culti-ism aside, this is just a terrible film with very few redeeming features.",1238457600,,2607,4.857142857142857

8213546,5,B000UJNJDQ,"I love this film,yes I BOUGHT it on Amazon,even wrote a review already. Film examines racial sterotypes,simular to the ones still exsisting in black and other minorities(asian,latinos,lighter skinned individuals versus dark).Predjudice people prefer to sweep under the rug or pretend doesn't exsist. Very insightful and thoughtful movie, funny at times!!. I think alot of persons should at least rent this just to possibly see THEMSELVES in this movie. This film can help to shine a light on discrimination and ignorance anywhere in the world. Well made movie, acting is just ok, visually beautiful setting(Miami Florida)very attractive cast and sets. check it out, good for group discussions and just plain old food for thought. Movie has a HAPPY ENDING,wish it could for all in real life.",1324512000,2,790,5.328
8213547,5,B000UJNJDQ,"I know I know !! my title for my review is cheesy ;-)
However the movie is not, it's a good film, really. WHY you ask?, IT'S DIFFERENT!. A good story, great location,(Miami)attractive and charming charecters, beautiful set design, extrordinary colors vibrant, alive, and real-- just like the film and it's subject matter. And we all know in most cultures,or societies ""color"" does matter-which is unfortunate since were all the same under the skin.
This movie was funny at times,sad as well,also revealing what others from a culture that is  very different from most americans,is unfortunately very much the same with predjudice as a central theme and bone of contention. I'm glad it had a happy ending!!! sweet movie!!.",1293580800,,720,5.050420168067227
8213548,5,B000UJNJDQ,"First of all please DON'T listen to the idiot below!!! He probably isn't Haitian and he is taking certain context of the film way too deep. Haitians have certain mannerisms that we incorporate in conversations. We use our body a lot during conversation and we even have certain sounds that we add to the convo to be more expressive. Those mannerisms make a simple conversation entertaining/funny and this is what the first commentator couldn't grasp. I'm not saying that you have to be Haitian to enjoy the movie but their are certain aspects in Creole that occur funnier to someone of that tongue compared to someone who doesn't understand and just follows the subs (I believe they call this ""Lost In Translation""). As in many countries such as the US, Haiti is very segregated and for someone to make a film of this type is a big deal. You see the perspective of a dark skin man and a very light skin man both friends and both Haitian.  They both have their taste in women which cause them to clash and that is where the comedy comes in. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, please don't let the comment above stop you from buying this film. I am Haitian/American born in N.Y. Both my parents are Haitian and I THANK GOD for that because I love my culture. We have to find a way to UNITE and stop putting down each other.

Support the Haitian Artist!

I also recommend ""I Love You Anne"" hilarious movie!!!",1258934400,3,1413,4.490272373540856
