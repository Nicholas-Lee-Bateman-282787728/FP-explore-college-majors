8673447,3,B00MOD2MLG,"I was simultaneously pleased and upset with this latest addition to the ""JUON"" legacy, believing it had run out of steam after the release of the non-canon double-feature, ""SIROI ROUZYO"" (""Old White Woman"" - the ""good"" one) and ""KUROI SYOUZYO"" (""Young Black Woman"" - the not-so-good one)... and with this revisiting of the ""original"" story arc, it shows that such an assessment was indeed correct.

This does not necessarily mean that ""OWARI no HAZIMARI"" is a bad film -- far from it -- but it is not entirely as engaging and engrossing a film as were its predecessors in the franchise.

The fault for that lies in the fact that it is somewhat difficult to determine or decide just how this entry should be interpreted as its own work.

On the one hand, it feels very much like an interconnection/continuation of what came before in the canonical storyline, but one where it's attempting to tie up the many loose ends of the series by also trying to present itself as a sort of ""origin"" story -- which does not work on that level not only because of its rampant inconsistencies with the earlier films (most obviously, the different house which hardly bears even the most minimal likeness to the original, but also where it regards many of the smaller details which had already been established, such as the methods and motivations of the essential main characters, the ""Saeki"" family), but also because the original ""V-Cinema"" productions had already supplied us with said ""origin story,"" and for those who are already familiar with those earliest stories it will be sharply noted that even with the greatest amount of imagination and suspension of disbelief that, try as hard as they might to get us to accept this explanation as the story's ""missing link,"" there is in truth no way possible to reconcile these two inconsistent and conflicting accounts.

So that leaves us with the option to view this as a ""remake/reimagining"" of the original source material (which feels like the most plausible explanation) or as a ""reboot"" of the franchise. Either way, it is no more possible to include this offering into the original 4-part canon than it is to claim that the Sam Raimi-produced American remakes fit neatly in the same universe and that they an organic outgrowth from the original storyline of events.

One nice ""plus"" (albeit fleeting and brief, and again inconsistent with the original legend) was to see the re-inclusion of the character ""Mar,"" whose very existence went entirely unacknowledged in the 4th installment, ""JUON 2"" (theatrical).

Making mind-numbing comparisons and trying to connect-the-dots with all of the preceding films will undoubtedly be a constant and unavoidable distraction throughout the viewing process, but ultimately ""Owari no Hazimari"" has to be taken for what it is, for whatever you believe that to be, for better or for worse... or for just, ""Meh!""",1417564800,2,2888,4.968944099378882
