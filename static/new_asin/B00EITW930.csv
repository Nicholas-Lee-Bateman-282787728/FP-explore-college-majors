Apparently no closed captioning or subtitling ( you can choose between German and English audio), the American DVD did have captioning (the Australian DVD doesn't ). Instead of cast interviews on disc 2 you get 2 series related postcards and a series of German dubbed DVD trailers on disc1. The disc menu is entirely in German, easy enough to figure out.
The episodes aren't listed on the disc surface but they are on the menu, in German. For the episodes themselves you'll find the episode title and all show credits done in German.
Listed as 1080p resolution I noticed increased image detail over the DVD even at my TV's 720p and think it was better even than the ""upconverted"" DVD  so if the extra picture detail is important to you I'd say go ahead and buy this set as apparently we won't be seeing an American Blu ray edition.",1436918400,,872,4.662337662337662
