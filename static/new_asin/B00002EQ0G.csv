1253315,1,B00002EQ0G,"And its certainly no Justice to Michelle Yeoh, go watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon or see The Heroic Trio to truly see her do her thang. This film was boring, no action scenes, no martial arts. And jackie chans cameo was embarassing. This movie is crap all the way. I hate to say that, but it was so boring.",976838400,6,311,4.288135593220339
1253316,3,B00002EQ0G,"Don't let the reviews misguide you, on either account, this was a potentially good movie done horribly wrong. Yeoh is a great figher, and she's just as quick and nimble as Chan, but we are only treated to one real right scene by her? Not only that, but that fight scene is interrupted by her Co-stars less than stellar fight scenes? Is it because she's female? Heck, it got so bad at one point, that it looked like Yeoh was going to be beaten do death (literally) by a hired goon. Why 3 stars? Cause she beats the crap outta the goon in a spectacular manner and does some of her trademark poses afterwards.",970358400,8,606,4.324561403508772
1253317,1,B00002EQ0G,"Pretty bad. Apparently the makers of Supercop 2 (actually Police Story 3) failed to remember the formula to a good action flick. The action is far  too brief and sporadic, at best, and there are a minimum of hair raising  stunts. Instead, the movie gets mired down into too much plot and the  stunts become negligible next to the boredom the film induces. One does not  watch a Hong Kong action flick for the dramatic acting (witch, by the way,  Yeoh is remarkably stiff and in need of a cattle prod to wake her up). Its  not a great story, anyway.
A far better Michelle Yeoh cop/gunplay and  kung fu film is Royal Warriors, or just stick with Supercop (in HK- Police  Story 2).
The dubbing is pretty awful. Yeoh dubs herself, and while her  English is great (after all, she was educated in Britain), her natural  voice is so deliberate, slow, and seemingly self conscious, that it is flat  and annoying. The dubbing company should be strung up for the way they dub  some of the characters, particularly Jackie Chan in his brief, weird cameo.  They use downright stereotypical Asian accents. The Jackie dubber has him  saying, ""Freeze Po-Reez!""(Freeze, Police)and ""I so  myself bored enough, that I began noticing little details to entertain  myself. One of witch was the fact that Michelle shows her European  education by turning the pages of a Chinese magazine the wrong way (in  China one reads right to left, but she flips the pages the English way,  left to right).",950572800,3,1471,4.67578125
1253318,1,B00002EQ0G,"I don't expect much from martial art movies but action.  This movie didn't even have that! I was facinated by Michelle Yeoh after seeing her in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  I was hoping to see more of Michelle  Yeoh's skills in this one, but the movie didn't catch my attention long  enough.  I only recommend this movie for insomniacs!",947980800,,331,4.637931034482759

7915711,3,B00002EQ0G,This is just a continuation of the Jackie Chan movie Super Cop only with a female in the top billing instead of Jackie.,1398556800,,119,4.217391304347826
7915712,3,B00002EQ0G,"Michelle Yeoh is a great actress, but comes up a little bland in this movie.  This movie also says starring Jackie Chan, well he does make a cameo appearance but that is all.  If you are a fan of Ms Yeoh then by all means get this dvd for you collection.",1361664000,,254,3.9607843137254903
7915713,3,B00002EQ0G,"rather weak film, except for a short jackie chan cameo. if you can get this relatively cheap and are a huge jackie fan, it is worth the price. if not, i believe for every good martial arts movie, you have to sit through ten bad chop-sockey flicks.",1268006400,,247,4.276595744680851
7915714,5,B00002EQ0G,"This is a Michelle Yoeh film and NOT a Jackie Chan film. Infact Jackie only appears in a hialarious 5 minutes of the whole film. Michelle is sent to Hong Kong to stop a gang, but what she doesn't know is that it is her own boyfriend who is the leader of the gang. As a result she's torn between love and honour. Which side do you think she'll end up going with?!",1037059200,4,362,3.9726027397260273
7915715,1,B00002EQ0G,This movie is really hard to watch! Jackie Chan is not in the sequel of his movie! why? i don't know. But i know that this movie is not good.,987206400,5,141,3.7333333333333334
7915716,2,B00002EQ0G,"There's many things wrong with this film, as people have said above, but in particular the DVD should be criticised for presenting the film in a terrible dubbed version only. Especially when the women in the film apart from Yeoh sound like California Barbies, and the men speak in this stereotyped Chinese accent. Gag!
Plus, a striking lack of features, although I'd be hard pressed to think of what I'd like to have. I haven't seen the original, but with most of Dimension's American releases, they've probably jettisoned the original soundtrack for some USANetwork Action Film schlock.
However, that said, there *is* a story here, which they should have focused on more, being the conflict between Yeoh's character and her lover-gone-bad. It would have made the ending tragic, instead of just a relief. Too much time is wasted on puerile ""You're a woman, it's too dangerous for you"" conversations between the rookie cops and Yeoh. Please.
Anyway, bottom line, disappointing and Dimension Films should keep its hands off the original films, or at least allow us the alternative version on the DVD.",979257600,14,1098,5.038461538461538
