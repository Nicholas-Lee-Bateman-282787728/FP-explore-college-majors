8227869,5,B000XCLC02,"I enjoyed this very much.  I like Buddy Guy and this was a good example of his music.
I play it over and over.",1327708800,,110,3.5833333333333335
8227870,4,B000XCLC02,"True indeed, the songs get cut off, and Magic Slim's portion of the DVD is only 20-25 minutes or so...HOWEVER, this is the only known commercially available DVD of this version of Magic Slim and the Teardrops, which in my opinion was one of the top 5 greatest Blues bands of all-time (when Magic Slim, John Primer, & Nick Holt were all in the band together).  Their playing together was telepathic and incredibly tight, and there is some terrific guitar playing from John Primer on display here... so I gave it 4 stars, really it probably deserves 3 and a half stars... if there is another commercially available DVD of this band, I'd love to know about it!",1277596800,,657,4.567796610169491
8227871,1,B000XCLC02,This is not a concert dvd. It more like a promotional dvd for Buddy Guy's Legends. All the songs are incomplete. The songs start in the middle and then you get 2-3 minutes of the song and then in transitions to the middle of the next song. Very disappointed with this dvd. Its great music an awesome guitar playing. But just when the song or solo gets good it cuts to the next track...very frustrating. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.,1235088000,2,423,4.3
