8336816,1,B001QWX850,"Unfortunately, I must give this item a subjective rating of one star, as I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewer ~ I have some primitive Hebrew, but it's certainly not good enough to follow everyday Israeli speech. As such, I purchased this item on the advertised promise that English subtitles would be provided... though when I played the discs, I discovered that this was not the case. The only subtitles on offer were in Hebrew for the hard of hearing, and since the only word I can read in Hebrew is 'shalom', this makes the box set of no use to me. I am happy to see that the description of the item has now been changed so as to prevent future misunderstandings... & if anyone ever does decide to bring out this set with English subtitles, I will be the first to fork over my shekels :-)",1347580800,11,808,4.3933333333333335
8336817,4,B001QWX850,"I had earlier purchased the second season [2008] of betipul. This is a riveting series. The 2008 season was subtitled.

I therefore enthusiastically purchased Season 1, 2005. This is NOT subtitled. While our ""street Hebrew"" is good enough to get us to washrooms and restaurants in Israel, it is NOT good enough to follow this non-subtitled set.
