7847818,4,6303455174,"Be Forever Yamato follows the tight template of the series. The Earth is attacked by an alien force. Earths defenses are obliterated and only the Yamato and its brave crew are left to save humanity. If you're a fan of the series, you have to accept that all Earth defense ships are essentially like paper mache in that they explode on contact. The Yamato, by contrast, seems completely indestructible even while getting hit by dozens of blasts simultaneously. The Yamato will smoke and pieces will break off but there seems to be no damage it cannot absorb. Seems strange since the Yamato should be using the same technology as the other ships but I guess we have to accept that the Yamato somehow has the spirit of the old WW II battleship.  So, once again the Yamato is Earths last hope and its crew heads off to defeat the alien invaders. They cant return to Earth because the Nebulans have dropped a massive bomb capable of wiping out all life so instead they head to The Black Nebula Empire itself where the detonator is kept.

When I was a child in the 70s I absolutely loved Star Blazers and Battle of the Planets. These were contemporaries of American shows like Superfriends but this was during a period of heavy American censorship and although I have fond memories of the Superfriend, in comparison to the shows coming out of Japan the Superfriends were empty and vapid. Even Battle of the Planets which included extreme editing was much more mature than the American cartoons. Star Blazers was far less edited and unlike any American cartoons I can recall contained a continuing storyline. With 26 episodes at about 23 minutes per you're talking about 598 minutes of storyline.

Be Forever Yamato feels like an abridged version of the first Star Blazers series, The Quest for Iscandar. The plot bears a lot of similarities but everything is compressed. For instance, in the original Space Battleship Yamato series viewers would be introduced to a Gamilon commander and the commander would stick around for a few episodes. In this movie, a commander is introduced and in minutes hes dead. The nice thing about this shorter story is that at 145 minutes it is movie length and the animation is cinematic quality. The animation is definitely a step up from the Star Blazers television show.

There is one big problem. The film was produced in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio but the producers of the DVD used a 1.33:1 aspect ratio which is the ratio of an old picture tube TV. This means we get thick black bars on either side of the picture. Even worse, when the Yamato arrives in the Dark Nebula the film switches to Cinemascope with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 which probably looked awesome in theaters and is closer to the 16:9 aspect ratio of most HD TVs but instead of expanding the picture horizontally they shrunk it vertically so the image now takes up perhaps half of the screen. Maybe less. The DVD was produced in 2003 and it looks woefully dated.

There are some plot issues that I won't get in to but overall I enjoyed the movie. The music is fantastic and the story is very emotional. So here is where I get stuck on a lot of these reviews. The source material is great but the transfer leaves a LOT to be desired. Yamato seems to have lost its appeal to western audiences. Space Battleship Yamato 2199 was released in 2012 but there has been no official U.S. release and the imported blu rays are insanely expensive. There just doesnt seem to be an interest in releasing anything Yamato related in the American market. A reviewer suggested the Japanese import of Be Forever Yamato and Im sure its much nicer but its also very expensive and contains no English subtitles. This may be as good as it gets for westerners who want to see the movie and it is a fine movie. As far as I can tell Voyager Entertainment exists solely to hold on to the U.S. rights to Star Blazers. There website lists no other properties and there site hasn't been updated since 2014. It gives me the impression that Space Battleship Yamato may be locked up in ownership hell much like Battle of the Planets/Gatchaman was for decades. Hopefully someday theyll be a breakthrough and we can get the best of Yamato here in the west.",1497830400,2,4214,4.613333333333333
7847819,3,6303455174,"4 stars for the movie itself, but only 1.5 or 2 stars for this particular presentation.

The movie is interesting, and is classic Yamato, though I will say that the character of Mio/Sasha is a big disappointment. In Yamato New Voyage, she's a whiny and crying infant, and sadly in Be Forever Yamato she doesn't seem to progress much from that point until late in the movie. She's also given a hyper-cute appearance which seems out of character with the regular cast character designs. It's out of place, making her appearance even more jarring. This is the big downside when getting to the crew and plot.

I can't be nearly as generous when it comes to the DVD transfer; this was shovelware, pure and simple, with no effort or time taken ensure a good presentation. It's the only DVD I've ever had where the picture was way too dark. I had to watch it on a computer with the gamma settings turned up, though adjusting the brightness/contrast on the TV would have come close. This is the only entry in the 5-disc set from Voyager that had this problem.

Be Forever Yamato is one of the few movies whose aspect ratio changes during the film. It starts out in the standard 4:3 NTSC size that the TV and movie series had used until that point, then halfway through the movie, it switches to 16:9 widescreen. In the theater, it was expected that the curtains would draw back to make the screen wider,  opening up the visuals in a similar way that the switch from black-and-white to color in the Wizard of Oz transported us. But on this Voyager DVD, the new aspect ratio is letterboxed inside of the 4:3 image, leaving black bars on the sides and the top and bottom, having the opposite effect as intended.  This is a common practice in the early early days of DVD, but Be Forever Yamato deserves better. For this reason alone, I recommend the Japanese import Blu-Ray over the US release.  Only problem with the Blu-Ray: it's in Japanese with no english subtitles. I ended up downloading a subtitle file, ripping the Blu-Ray, and playing the rip using the subtitle file. Excellent visuals and audio, along with 'semi-Engrish' subtitles. :-)",1427414400,2,2134,4.632275132275132

7847821,4,6303455174,"This movie picks up where Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage left off.  The nemesis in this film is the Black Nebula Empire, and they try to take over the Earth.  They have a powerful weapon that can annihilate humanity if they resist a full-scale invasion.  They also want to know where the Yamato is.  Kodai and the crew of the Yamato learn the ship is at Space Station Icarus, and they commandeer the ship of a high-ranking official in an attempt to reach the station.  The Black Nebula Empire catch on to them and attack the group as they attempt to flee.  During the attempt, Yuki is shot, and Kodai and the others are forced to leave her behind.  The film continues with a number of surprises that are revealed, and these surprises lead up to the climax.

The DVD contains several special features.  These include: the original theatrical trailer for Be Forever Yamato, Original Art Galleries (a gallery of line art), scans of the booklet handed out at theaters showing Be Forever Yamato, and the text-only features ""The Yamato Story: The Making of Be Forever"" and ""1980: The Summer of Yamato.""

Be Forever Yamato is an interesting film, and doesn't seem to come out of nowhere after Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage.  Anyone who considers themselves a fan of Space Battleship Yamato should have this DVD in their collection.",1221523200,5,1343,4.745689655172414
7847822,5,6303455174,"I wish that they (Voyager entertainment) had done new digitally cleaned up and restored masters in 5.1 sound.  The japan release have at least the option of stereo, or dolby 3 channel surround.
Most of the japanese release though also have deleted scenes restored, and new ones added in the t.v. shows.  But they are not in english and are region 2.  Some of the japan ones of the yamato films are ""letterboxed""  but not all of them.  I have the first one Space Battleship Yamato and it is a cross between Matted widescreen which is really fullscreen stretched to fit the theater screen and Real 35mm widescreen.  Matsumoto and crew took animated material from the show and shot it with a widescreen camera, mostly the special effects and things.  Final Yamato also was presented in a 75mm widescreen format when shown in theaters and voyager does not own it.  They told me they needed the original soundtrack (the japanese dialogue and sound effects) to do a remaster and they don't own them.  Too bad Nishizaki couldn't have used his influence to have a remaster done for todays standards of audio and video quality, It could have been just the shot in the arm the fans needed to interest them in his newly proposed t.v. show. But many fans are outraged that Matsumoto and Nishizaki did not reteam, and matsumoto bowed out.  And he promised to do his own version of the new yamato ""changed to great galaxy"" to avoid copyright infringement.",1078012800,3,1441,4.682539682539683
7847823,3,6303455174,This movie was aired in Japan and proved to be so popular that lines for the theater went around blocks. It was later decided to redo the movie as the Comet Empire saga. Which proved to be a great idea since most of the Star Force cast was killed in this movie including the Yamato getting destroyed. The Comet Empire Saga features footage from this movie and was edited for American viewers to imply certain characters had lived instead of being killed as stated in the movie. So you can buy this movie and The Comet Empire Saga and compare the two.,1050278400,5,550,4.401960784313726
