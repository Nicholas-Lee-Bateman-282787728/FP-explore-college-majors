8420203,4,B004AGN9HQ,"[Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars, Moderate Spoilers] We learn that ""William"" (Lukas Haas) and ""Maggie"" (Molly Parker) married very young, before ""Danny"" (Adam Scott) put his nose in where it didn't belong, amongst other parts of his anatomy (LOL).  William, after deserting Maggie for years, then suddenly shows up one day at Danny's parents' serene lakeside cottage.  From there, Danny's Mom makes a couple of phone calls, and the inevitable confrontation of the threesome is set.  A few too-abbreviated scenes that feel incomplete, along with quite abrasive language (and that totally unnecessary adult-film scene), are thankfully offset by humor (especially childish-but-hilarious scenes between Haas and Scott in about the first half of the film) and the element of surprise, though bordering on soap-opera themes, and viewers will likely be relieved to get much-anticipated answers.  There was certainly room for improvement, but what we do get is a fine novelty of a film in its story line, cinematography, attractively odd soundtrack, and intelligent performances by all.",1483315200,,1074,5.490909090909091

8420205,4,B004AGN9HQ,"NOTE:
There are a number of ""F"" bombs dropped in this film,
but the foul language is primarily early in the story.

As part of an ECHO BRIDGE 12 movie pack that as of this date isn't available at AMMY,
I just saw WHO LOVES THE SUN (Canada-2006), with Lukas Haas, Molly Parker,
Adam Scott, R.H. Thomson and Wendy Crewson.

With two grown men initially fighting like angry children,
there's some silliness in the first half hour but then it becomes total drama.

This is literally a five character story, set on an idyllic lake (love the location!). It opens with a young man of 31 who reappears after an absence of five years. He's come unexpected to the country home of his best friend's parents, a place where he literally grew up. So the mother calls her son who's been busy in NYC working on a magazine and getting a novel published; he also arrives directly. Meanwhile, mom phones the long-lost wanderer's wife, who is soon among them, thus reuniting what was once a very close friendly triangle.

And that's about as much as I'll reveal.
It's a good story with a few surprises and a partly open ending.",1443139200,,1107,4.52
8420206,4,B004AGN9HQ,"A truly independent film. The stars are not big names but they are actors you recognize and respect. The story was different and reactions of the characters not expected. Example, cheating wife angry at the cheated husband for leaving when she is caught during the act. Sorry you cheat and lose your chance at righteous indignation.  Overall it kept my interest and I was pleasantly surprised.",1370649600,,393,4.954545454545454
8420207,5,B004AGN9HQ,"As someone who has seen and owns literally thousands of movies, I can say that is one the best movies that I have seen. The story just keeps going and going. There was never a dull moment. The acting was absolutely great, every one of the actors. The first reviewer gave the movie one star out of five, but he/she only saw the movie for less than 15 minutes. I saw the movie on Apple TV and liked it so much that I bought DVD copy afterwards. This is the kind of movie people pay to see and have a good time!",1345680000,,508,3.9901960784313726

8420209,4,B004AGN9HQ,"The inexplicably named _Who Loves the Sun_ is about (yawn) family members long separated who reunite under the old familial roof (in this case a lakeside cabin) and struggle and grow as the skeletons are marched out of the closet. It is, in other words, the male equivalent of a chick flick. As such, it is in a constant state of tension. On side, it's pulled toward the trite by a predictable plot (only interrupted the screenplay's unnecessary insistence on symmetry) and a soundtrack that tells you how you should be feeling at any given moment. And there are a few groaner lines that could have been plucked from any of a number of other such films (e.g., a line to the effect of `You have everything but you had to take the one thing that matters to me!').

On the other side, it's pulled toward greatness by thoughtful cinematography -- check out the composition of the shot that's used in the movie poster -- but especially the intense performances by a well cast set of actors (all five of them): the characters are deeply flawed, flawed enough that they give you no shortage of reasons for hating them, and yet not only are infectiously charming in spite of themselves as characters, but also give us a sense of how they could alternately like and loathe themselves. In particular, the as-close-as-brothers childhood friends who can no longer stand the sight of each other have a tremendous chemistry (or anti-chemistry). They exude the kind of hostility only possible with sustained intimacy. Adam Scott's character is clearly a jerk but he's played with such deftness that ultimately you can empathize with his pain. Lukas Haas (the boy in _Witness_) is a dork (a `jackass' as another character puts it) but he too ultimately is sympathetic. Then of course Molly Parker -- my reason for watching this film -- comes across quite convincing as the girl from growing up who felt like the center of the world to the boys around her and whose every word can still send them from despair to euphoria and back again.

I could easily imagine someone dismissing this as the adult equivalent of an after-school special, but for my part, I got sucked into the characters and had, for me, the very rare sensation of ""Hey, I know these people.""

Incidentally, if you like this, you'll also probably like _Marion Bridge_, which also stars Molly Parker. It's the straight chick flick version of this story and it doesn't hit a false note.",1297036800,5,2434,4.722352941176471
