I received my order on time as promised, and the DVD is perfect.  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying these.",1252368000,,335,3.911764705882353

This is good guys vs bad guys and the good guys win..  Innocent and entertaining..  Jon Hall was quite a guy and became a good role model for many in the 50s..  Do not judge these episodes against todays production values.. Simple stories for simple kids, and after all, ALL kids begin life's journey innocent and simply..  ENJOY..",1208476800,,444,5.197183098591549
