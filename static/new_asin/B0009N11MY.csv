That makes it hard to enjoy the performance fully if you don't understand 19th century operatic Italian. There needs to be a way to enjoy opera online out of season. But this is not it.",1449964800,4,330,4.706896551724138
8225321,5,B0009N11MY,"Norma has not fared well on dvd. The Sutherland video with the Australian Opera has a great performance from Sutherland, but a second rate supporting cast and dreadful staging, sets, and costumes. And the sound fades in and out. The Caballe video live from the Orange Festival has terrible staging and hurricane winds blowing the costumes in everyone's faces, which is quite distracting. The sound is also not very good. Caballe sings beautifully, but her acting is atrocious. The June Anderson Norma is wonderful. She sings beautifully and with great vocal power. And her acting is excellent. The staging, the sets, and the costumes are adequate. And the sound is good.",1377388800,6,670,5.045045045045045
8225322,1,B0009N11MY,"Norma Bellini's opera is one of my favorites, but this version is to chill any Roman centurion.

  The soloists are average to poor and still suffering from the horrible sound pickup. When the scene is transported to the top or bottom of the stage no one hears anything.

  The voices are metal, not that soloists sing well, but the adjustment of the microphones becomes.

  The Adalgisa is interpreted by Raffaela Angeletti, thinks the girl is a doll, always makes static movements. Does she entered the wrong opera, Les Contes thought it was D'Hoffmann?

  Maria Dragoni has no concept of scenic interpretation. His standard is pure boredom.

  Scenarios are a cliche, and beats the old Roman columns and staircases.

  The orchestra seems a school band.

  The chorus has a sound horroroza.

  Two and a half hours of pure torture.

  Friends, her shelf. This deserves the gallows in perpetuity.

Portuguese:

Norma de Bellini  uma das minhas peras preferidas, mas essa verso  de arrepiar qualquer centurio romano.

  Os solistas so medianos para ruins e ainda sofrem com a horrvel captao de som. Quando a cena se transporta para o alto ou o fundo do palco ningum escuta nada.

  As vozes so metlicas, no que os solistas cantem assim, mas a regulagem dos microfones as transforma.

  A Adalgisa  interpretada por Raffaela Angeletti, a moa pensa que  uma boneca, faz sempre movimentos estticos. Ser que ela entrou na pera errada, pensou que era Les Contes D'Hoffmann?

  Maria Dragoni no tem a menor noo de interpretao cnica. Sua Norma  pura monotonia.

  Os cenrios so um clich, as velhas e batidas colunas e escadarias romanas.

  A Orquestra parece uma banda escolar.

  O coro tem uma sonoridade horroroza.

  Duas horas e meia de pura tortura.

  Amigos, prateleira nela. Essa merece as gals perptuas.",1285891200,,1808,4.925423728813559
8225323,1,B0009N11MY,"This Norma is a total disaster on every front. All the singers sound terrible and the staging is an impressive fiasco. Theodossiou and Ventre were in much better voice in the previous Norma Dynamic DVD, but the staging there was even worse. I can't believe that both Theodossiou's and Ventre's voices deteriorated so bad in just 2 years - I think the problem with this production is the huge flat outdoor space with dead acoustic. I think that explains why everyone, including the chorus sounds bad and strained. I heard Simon Orfila in Barcelona 2 years before this production and he did not sound so thin. I also heard Barcellona live 2 years earlier and she did not sound so bad. The chorus does not have an impact because they are spread in one line a mile left and right. I don't understand how anyone can perform in such a space without electronic amplification. The staging looks impressive on photos but it is no more than a series of static symmetrical postures inspired by Delacroix's or David's paintings with no dramatic force. For once I agree with the ""Gramophone"" magazine's reviewer John Steane who trashed this DVD from every angle (""Unfortunately, on almost every count, this Norma is a definite no-no."").",1210464000,8,1223,4.800947867298579
8225324,5,B0009N11MY,"[This review is NOT of the Dessi DVD on Hardy. Amazon has mixed-up their product page details and reviews. You might try notifying them as I have. Together we might reach a critical mass and get them to fix the problem.]

Whether or not librettist Felice Romani had Medea in the back of his mind when he wrote Norma for Vincenzo Bellini in 1831, it is obvious that there are certain similarities in plot and mood. That inevitable comparison is heightened with this outdoor production in the huge amphitheater that is Sferisterio in Macerata Italy. Filmed in gorgeous high definition, with a minimalist set that is discretely decorated with Celtic symbols as well as Buddhist, pre-Columbian, Roman and even African signs, the mood is ancient, mythic, even Jungian. The feeling of attending a Greek tragedy as an outdoor religious observance is palpable. This is opera as ancient festival and it heightens the experience greatly. There is no denying the impact this dvd makes just with its visual elements.

The performances are slower, more monumental in scope than in an indoor opera house. Perhaps the visual distances involved make this necessary. But it has the ancillary effect of heightening the outdoor ritual aspects of the performance. We might be in a Celtic grove amongst sacred trees, stealthily watching a Druidic ceremony. This Norma looks and feels big and luckily we have two hefty voices to fill the void. Dimitra Theodossiou as Norma has a large voice that manages to fill this vast theatrical space. Daniela Barcellona as Adalgisa has another big voice. Both are well equipped to sing these two problematic roles. Norma's difficulties are well known: Beverly Sills once recommended that the singer of the part wear comfortable shoes. And Norma nearly destroyed Renata Scotto's voice. All of the vocal performances in this production are quite good. The acting is as well, though we are witness to much broader performances than usual, given the size of the venue.

The Orchestra Regionale delle Marche is conducted by Paolo Arrivabeni. As this is an outdoor performance, some aspects of the strings are lost in the open air and the horns are naturally emphasized. Technically, the instruments of the orchestra are nicely recorded, sounding rich and full enough both in PCM stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1, and they play quite well. The film itself is beautiful in its high definition crispness and visual clarity. The cameras emphasize close-ups, when necessary, but usually linger in the middle distance for an orchestra distance view. The opera runs for 165 minutes on two discs with no extras and a booklet written in four languages.

This is a monumental open air Norma, the outdoor aspects of which I found both appropriate and enjoyable. It's not vintage Callas or Sutherland but it is enthralling in its own way. Recommended.

8225325,4,B0009N11MY,"Dimitra Theodossiou est la nouvelle Norma de cet enregistrement du festival de Macerata 2007. Il faut se souvenir que Norma fut l'un des derniers rles scniques de Maria Callas, qu'elle abandonna en 1965  l'opra de Paris. Aprs elle, d'autres cantatrices s'emparrent du rle avec succs : Sutherland et Caball, bien sr, mais aussi Scotto et Verrett, notamment.... Et puis, et puis, dans les annes 90, ce fut le dsert.... Seule Edita Gruberova releva le dfi, avec succs, certes, mais avec une approche dramatique assez proche du concours de grimaces et de gesticulations peu orthodoxes, en regard du mlodrame romantique.
Ce spectacle est donc le bienvenue pour rappeler que Norma est une rle complexe et riche, qui demande normment en termes de maturit vocale et de technique belcantiste. Ici, les conditions sont amplement remplies, avec un spectacle sobre (totalement oppos au show Gruberova) et des partenaires efficaces. Dans un cadre magnifique, le metteur en scne a su recrer une gestuelle digne des thtres antiques, et redonner vie  une oeuvre que peu de maisons d'opras osent remonter de nos jours.",1202860800,10,1101,5.179775280898877
