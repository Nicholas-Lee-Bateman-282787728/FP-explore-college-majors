8448818,3,B004YTOF0Y,"As someone who participated in UWP on the local level, with a local cast at my high school, I was oblivious to much of the nonsense that went on at the national level.  There was a lot of diversity of opinion about the war and other social issues in our group - maybe we WERE brainwashed - I know we were naive to think that we could change the world by singing, but that's what we believed. We were teenagers and very idealistic. We also, like the hippies, wanted to have a good time, and for some, it was no more than that. It was interesting to get a larger perspective, but I hate that we were used like that.  I liked the film, but I think it would have been more interesting if the filmmakers had investigated the grassroots element of UWP, (because it truly was a grassroots movement) and how it manifested itself in towns and cities through the US.",1428019200,5,856,4.277777777777778

8448820,1,B004YTOF0Y,"I was very disappointed.  I was happier remembering the joy that filled our home around 1968 by playing an L.P. of Up, Up With People to begin each Saturday morning for over twenty years.  This DVD Smile Til It Hurts is very negative about the story of Up With People.

I recommend that anybody who would rather retain the wonderful memories, even if it means keeping a deaf ear to right or wrong history... should not buy ""Smile Til It Hurts"".",1405641600,5,444,4.45679012345679

I found the subject fascinating; I had no idea that the Menudo-like group kept going well after the music style (Nixonian rock alternative music) ran out of steam in the mid-`70s.  I came to the DVD documentary due to my interest in BAD music (odd, kitsch, so bad it's good, camp, toxically commercial ... as recording genres, like combining heavy metal and mariachi music, bluegrass and Eastern mysticism, and anything on the Arista label in the `70s-`80s), not knowing that the primary marketing function of the music took a back seat to The Wizard of Oz behind-the-curtain politics.

The right-wing political backing did jump out, but the documentary didn't explore that SING OUT/UP WITH PEOPLE/ MORAL RE-ARMAMENT was just one part of a general censorship and co-opting pop music marketing movement that one can trace back to WWI-era broadsides against jazz dancing, syncopated ragtime, alto saxophones being the cause of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and Paul Whiteman being crowned THE KING OF JAZZ.  UP WITH PEOPLE was the most media prominent of music mimicking early `60s popular styles, such as Janet Greene's folky tunes about communists (alternative universe Joan Baez), or an album THE GOLDWATERS SING SONGS TO BUG THE LIBERALS.  However, about 30 minutes into the picture Peter Yarrow suggests the genre with his ""Guantanamo"" impromptu song, which he refers to as ""imbecile music"" (I like that; one of my friends coined ""punishment music"" about the stuff we trade around.  ""Imbecile music""--!).

I found the film did impress me about the movement and suggested a sinister or skeptical, well, smell about the whole enterprise, that the show was a play to the crowd, succinctly pointed out by one of the final interviewees about the 1980s Detroit shows to the autoworkers' crowds.  The DVD is like a good, if enigmatic, book, where the real meat of the story is buried between the lines, requiring or suggesting a sense that one has to view/read the text with an eye to literary archaeology, but once you catch on, the story is loaded, requiring attention to the details, which makes the DVD much more interesting (thank those pause, forward, and reverse buttons on the remote) than what a passive run-through gives.  It's a delightfully subversive, at times ominous, telling and suggestion; I'm a bit surprised that it got made at all.  I'd like to see more, and deeper on this subject--especially that ""follow the money"" riff in the picture, as regards songwriting, publishing, and performance royalties on the songs.  UP WITH PEOPLE didn't record/perform cover songs or use outside publishing for song choices.  On the plus comic side of the presentation, dig those uniforms.  About the 30 minute mark, 1960s uniforms right out of the cover shots on the first two Doodletown Pipers' album photos (dirty sunflower yellows, forest greens, medium blues, bleached white slacks, guys all wearing boat deck sneakers!), morphing into day-glow `70s polyester!

Record nut stuff:

I think of the albums, starting with the 1966 Lp, SING OUT - THE MUSICAL; UP WITH PEOPLE (Pace 1101), as part of a style marker trend (like disco:  no one bought the marketing push) which kicked in about mid-1965:  Nixonian Rock Alternative, those split boy/girl pop groups that vanilla-ed rock music songs/styles.  The pop recording industry created or exploited ""folk"" music as whitebread happy hootenanny pop music, beginning about September, 1958 with the Kingston Trio, which really kicked into going into 1961, at least on Lp (but not so much on pop singles' charts) and lasted into mid-'63, then tanked almost overnight in early '64.  Beginning in mid-'65, some of the now declining ""folk"" acts morphed into kitsch pop cover groups, notably the New Christy Minstrels, the Brothers Four, among others. Also, acts like the Young Americans (UP WITH PEOPLE seems both a style imitation and parody of that act) put out several albums, Capitol tried floating THE NEW CLASSIC SINGERS, Al Martino's producer put his name on The Peter DeAngelis Singers, Stu Phillips (those Hollyridge Strings' Beatles albums) produced the Doodletown Pipers on Epic; even Jerry Lewis put his name on THE JERRY LEWIS SINGERS SING YESTERDAY AND OTHER FOLK-ROCK HITS on a Dot Records Lp. It looks like the record companies pushed and plugged up the retail plumbing and warehouses with these releases repeatedly going into about 1970.  But the UP WITH PEOPLE album(s) were different in one respect:  original songs and Moral Re-Armament owned the publishing rights (read the UP WITH PEOPLE Pace 1101 Lp liner notes).  The Lp, of all things, spent three months on Billboard's album chart, beginning 7/23/66, and appeared on the Cash Box Lp chart 8/20/66, #96, 88, 87, 89....

One of my enemi...friends used that 1966 UP WITH PEOPLE album for a cardboard stuffer in a box of albums he sent me.  A bit later I played a BAD music find, THE BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY SINGERS SOUNDS OF FREEDOM Lp, MGM SE 4546 (May, 1968), and caught three familiar songs, checked the UP WITH PEOPLE SING OUT 1966 Lp, same songs:

(credits are from the MGM label; they're not listed as Moral Re-Armament publishing on SE 4546)--
""A New Tomorrow"" (L. Douglas-F. Norman-M. Bearden) Laertes Music Co. ASCAP
""Paul Revere"" (B. Darnel-G. Shannon-Al Stillman) Odette Music Corp. ASCAP
""Freedom Isn't Free"" (Hy Zaret) Argosy Music Corp. ASCAP
(Also on Lp, which I think is a Moral Re-Armament song, is ""Mr. Washington,"" which is a version of ""We Are With You Mr. Washington,"" showing songwriting credit as P.D., meaning Public Domain.)

Also, Maureen Reagan put out a May, 1968, 45 single by a Moral Re-Armament song, ""Which Way America,"" on Lincoln 1001.  Maureen Reagan is Ronald Reagan's daughter.

Edit:  Two more songs placed--
""With Everything Changing"" (Cates-Caldwell) and ""The Further We Reach Out"" (Fields-Caldwell-Asby), publishing credit to Up With People Music (ASCAP) on the New Seekers U.S. Lp, PINBALL WIZARDS, MGM-Verve MV 5098, from May, 1973.

And three more (5/15/14)--
""The Ride of Paul Revere,"" ""Freedom Isn't Free"" and ""Which Way America"" on Lp, July, 1970 or so, as by an LDS sponsored singing group from El Cerrito, CA, THE GRAND LAND SINGERS ""IN WASHINGTON D.C."" on Century Records 38900.  Century Records was a private press label operated by the Keysor family out of Saugus, California, from 1960-1975, which specialized in mostly high school and college band recordings...and some oddball stuff like the Mugleston Family Band.  The Grand Land Singers also put out another Lp album which dates Fall or so, 1974, DISCOVER YOUR AMERICA, from a TV show soundtrack recording, which includes ""Freedom Isn't Free"" as part of one of the tracks, ""Freedom Medley.""

Weird!  And a documentary worth watching!",1383177600,12,6775,5.0903342366757
8448822,5,B004YTOF0Y,"I saw this film at a screening at the Sedona Film Festival in Arizona a few years ago, going in with no expectations and a lot of curiosity.

""Up With People"" was an establishment response to the destructive hippies with their anger and drugs and selfishness and self-destruction.  Gather young and talented teens and let them put on a show.  Try to reach the youth of America with an alternative to tuning in, turning on and dropping out.  Naturally, Up With People was greeted with considerable scorn and mocking at the time, becoming the punch line for a lot of hipsters and comedians.  Then they were gone.

So, going into this documentary, I was genuinely curious at how the filmmakers were going to approach this subject.  Were they going to keep a straight face or would this be something like a THIS IS SPINAL TAP approach?

I have to say, this is an honest history of Up With People, and it becomes genuinely touching by the end.  The film covers the group's inception, the public's reaction, and then goes on to revisit some members all these years later.  That is where the heart of this film lies: the people who are still proud of what they've done.

By the end, I was touched and cheering these people on.  They really believed in what they did.  And they're still standing proud today.  The big surprise to me was that SMILE TIL IT HURTS is a story of triumph.  I LIKED these people.

So definitely check this film out.  Keep an open mind and maybe it will touch your heart.",1380672000,10,1489,4.496268656716418
