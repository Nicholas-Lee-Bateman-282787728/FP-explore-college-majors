8414953,5,B0043GIX4W,"From November 10, 2010 to November 16, 2010, I was aboard the Queen Mary 2 sailing from Southampton to New York. While aboard ship I attended three lectures given by a wonderful showman and marvelous speaker, Bill Miller (born May 3, 1948), who is a great expert on the ocean liners of the past and present. In this DVD, ""Mr. Ocean Liner"" we learn that Bill has made his love affair with the maritime life of New York into a business and an obsession. His home in Hoboken contains over 1000 ship models, many books, and memorabilia related to ships. He also collects model ship funnels. One friend described it as living in a toy store. He has written scores of books and given countless lectures. He's made 300 trips on 50 ships.
 Large sections of this were filmed on Cunard ships and featured interviews with Cunard staffers. To say this is a puff piece is an understatement. Bill is a man with a ego that he willingly shares with the rest of the world. I know of no one who knows as much about luxury liners and who so entertainly imparts his knowledge. A public school teacher for many years, he retired in 2002. Words used to describe him in the film: charismatic, magnetic, passionate (about ships), a born entertainer, electrifying.
 There's a lot of nostalgia in this as he thinks about the golden age of liners before the jets took over. As a kid he sat on the Hoboken side and looked at the array of liners coming and going to the west side piers. I worked for Cunard in 1953 at 25 Broadway so this book brought back some pleasant memories.
  Bill's love of maritime books started in 1961 with his purchase of an ocean liner book for twenty dollars in a Whitehall Street store when he was about thirteen. His inspiration and mentor became the ship chronicler Frank Braynard.
 He loves New York harbor and works with the South Street Seaport museum as a curator. His enthusiasm for ships is infectious. One of his favorite duties aboard ship is giving the commentary as ships enter New York harbor. When this was filmed, Bill was 61 so expect to see him on one of your cruises as a lecturer. One friend says, ""His aura radiates."" The DVD is a love fest for Bill, but he's a rare man with a zest for communicating his vast ship lore with his listeners and readers. I wish he'd put some of his wonderful lectures on DVD.",1296950400,4,2328,4.455399061032864
