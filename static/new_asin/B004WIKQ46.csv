4486528,5,B004WIKQ46,"WELL DONE! 3 separate documentaries, award-winning, based on Theodore H. White's books, one a Pulitzer Prize winner. Each feature is 79 min. and is a continual look at elections via historic archival film footage. Very nostalgic for those of us old enough to have watched 1960's election news. The footage, some a half-century old, explains the predominance of B/W. The final '68 disc has the early period-capable color. You see it as all Americans (the world) saw it on TV. Wonderful. When the actual footage sound is muted, excellent narration fills the audio.

SUBTITLES exist for all 3 features, PLUS the bonus films. Viewer's guide adds fun campaign historical info. Remember Pat Paulsen?

1 THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, 1960
Eisenhower will be replaced by whom? Footage goes from primary campaigns to conventions and finally the fall election JFK wins. This period of time is when campaigns/conventions were more than money & TV ads. The conventions actually chose a candidate-not just a programed prime time 4-day political party pep session and media event. There was drama & suspense. A very unbiased look at the Presidential campaigns of all the 1960's elections. Even in B/W!
Bonus: 25 min B/W '64 Democrat Convention tribute to JFK. 5 text 'loser' bios: Dems Symington, Stevenson, Humphrey, Johnson; Rep Rockefeller

2 THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, 1964
Part 1: 'The Battle for the Nomination' begins with a Dallas assassination of JFK. Johnson's short run as replacing JFK makes him the incumbent. Republicans play catch-up, but with a Rep liberal/conservative conflict. Goldwater vs. Rockefeller. But Lodge wins NH. Remember campaign songs? Civil Rights & M.L.King become big news in 1963.
Part 2: Black riots become an election issue. Dem Convention is all Johnson and the question of his running mate. Even so soon after a Presidential assassination, LBJ campaigns hand-to-hand, pressing the flesh with no fear. Goldwater statements put fear in potential voters. ""Landslide Johnson"" actually sets a landslide record, with a 2/3 Dem congress.
Bonus: 51 min. ""The March of Time: Seven Days in the Life of the President"" (LBJ) See Bill Moyers, LBJs press sec, as a young man, no gray.; 2 text failed Republican candidate bios: Lodge, Scranton

3 THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, 1968
Author T.H.White opens (in color). Following is the Viet Nam problem and Tet. McCarthy announces to fight Johnson-college students join. For Republicans, ""Nixon's the One."" Romney runs a short race. McCarthy's NH showing encourages Bobby Kennedy. War overpowers Pres. Johnson's campaign-HE QUITS THE RACE! VP Humphrey jumps in. M.L.King goes to Memphis, his mountaintop end. Violence continues in Nam & USA. Kennedy leads CA primary poll-WINS!-then is shot in front of a TV camera. Rockefeller & Reagan toss in hats. Rep nominee Nixon watches the riotous Dem Convention in Chicago. Wallace impacts the election.
Bonus: 6 text post-election bios: McCarthy, McGovern, Romney, Reagan, Wallace, LeMay

With the wonderful fresh look at the archival footage, it seems like only yesterday. And history has told us so much more about the winners and losers of the 1960's elections. Historically educational for some, nostalgic for me. A good political documentary set, without the party bias. Refreshing.

Companion DVD potential might be: ""20th Century Politics & Presidents with Mike Wallace.""",1305849600,11,3379,5.271375464684015

8445112,4,B004WIKQ46,"I teach college juniors and seniors political communications. 1960 was a pivotal year/campaign for understanding the ""campaign industry"" and the advent of a different kind of political journalism, which Teddy White spurred with his pioneering book. Watching this superb documentary conveys that fact very effectively. And The Making of the President 1968 is a terrific primer on that year's chaos and tragedy, and how it shaped so much of what we live with (suffer through?) today.",1381536000,,481,5.342105263157895

8445115,3,B004WIKQ46,"I remember when ""The Making Of The President 1960"" was first aired.  It had great picture quality.  Inasmuch as it was produced on film and didn't have to rely on old kinescopes, I expected to find similar quality on this dvd set. What you get here appears to be copied from old 16mm films distributed for the educational market.  Particularly on the 1960 show, the picture is jumpy and very fuzzy. The dvd ""extras"" about what happened to the ""also rans"" after the election is nothing more than two pages of on-screen written text.  Aside from the aforementioned negatives, the script, editing, and Martin Gabel's narration are excellent.  With a list price of about $60, one would expect more.  I would recommend buying the set to those extremely interested in history as seen through the prism of the era.",1363824000,,807,4.76978417266187
8445116,5,B004WIKQ46,"Great documentaries for anyone interested in American history. It was a very dynamic time in our history, with 3 very unique Presidents dealing with the Vietnam war, the Soviet Union and the Civil Rights movement.",1354492800,,213,5.114285714285714
8445117,5,B004WIKQ46,"In three DVDs comes three documentaries, all produced in the 1960s, covering the three Presidential elections during that decade.

First the 1960 election which had John F. Kennedy winning the presidency over Richard Nixon. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson, now President after Kennedy's assassination, clobbers Barry Goldwater. And then in 1968, Richard Nixon comes back and beats Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace.

Each of these documentaries is interesting and contains a lot of footage of these candidates both from the campaign trail and during the conventions. Particularly interesting was coverage of candidates who tried for various nominations, but eventually lost out, such as an early appearance in American politics by Ronald Reagan, Nelson Rockefeller, and George Romney, among others.

Also included in the set are two bonus features. The first is a short documentary on Kennedy's short presidency that was shown at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. The other is a documentary covering a somewhat intimate look at the average life of President Lyndon Johnson.

All in all, I found this set to be a very interesting look at the three Presidential elections of the 1960s. I would recommend this DVD set to those interested in Presidential history.",1343001600,,1259,5.375634517766497
8445118,3,B004WIKQ46,"Has very interesting history but sound makes it difficult to understand what some of the charaters are saying.  So many historical faces but often not names.  Names as subtitles would have been helpful with position title. Still, worth the time to watch.  Really learn at lot about our presidents and what they went through to reach the office of President.  You also learn about our relationship with other countries plus other additonal info.",1321660800,2,444,5.041095890410959
