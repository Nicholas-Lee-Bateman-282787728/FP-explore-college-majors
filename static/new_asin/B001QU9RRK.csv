3770407,5,B001QU9RRK,"Well at least we are getting these shows, little by little- I would rather have a half season at a time than no season at a time- I love Dynasty - at this rate it will take years for us to get the whole series but at least they are coming and its something to look forward too. Maybe Paramount should do some advertising to better the sales. I know I am looking forward to it - The Dallas shows are almost done being fully released - Season 11 out of 14 is due in April too - I have been enjoying them as I have and will Dynasty........................

3770430,4,B001QU9RRK,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

The first batch of episodes from Season 4 finds Alexis (Joan Collins) and Krystle (Linda Evans) back where we left them in the previous year's cliffhanger - trapped in Steven's cabin which has been set alight by persons unknown.

Adam (Gordon Thomson) successfully frames Alexis for the toxic paint fiasco; whilst Blake (John Forsythe) takes Steven (Jack Coleman) to court in order to win permanent custody of little Danny.  Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) emerges from the loony-bin a completely new woman and within five minutes has landed a job at La Mirage...and a plan to ensure Steven's triumph in court!

Once again, Krystle's trampy niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) breezes into town for more mud-flinging hijinks--jeeze, that New York ""modelling"" job must allow lots of holiday time!

Still reeling from the fact that Adam is the father of her baby, Kirby (Kathleen Beller) starts becoming desperate when she suspects Jeff (John James) of rekindling his relationship with Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin), who'se disappointingly turned into a tamed, submissive working mother for the best part of this season.  Whatever happened to the wild, bed-hopping Fallon from the good old days?

New characters:  ""Dex"" Dexter (Michael Nader), a powerful new ally for Alexis, shady European aristocrat Peter De Vilbis (Helmut Berger); and Tracy Kendall (Deborah Adair), Krystle's assistant in the PR department, looking for a little upward mobility...  The special Carousel Ball episode also features a cameo appearance from President and Mrs Ford.

Includes the following episodes:
The Arrest
The Bungalow
The Note
The Hearing (Parts 1 & 2)
Tender Comrades
Tracy
Dex
Peter De Vilbis
The Proposal
Carousel
The Wedding
The Ring

3770431,5,B001QU9RRK,"Love Dynasty.  Got stung buying previous vols. from US on Amazon, as they were split into volumes.  I've now released Dynasty is released in Australia as full seasons.  Season 4 was released in December 2009 for about $35.  My advice is if your dvd player is multi region hunt down the Australia release.",1263427200,2,304,4.679245283018868
3770432,3,B001QU9RRK,"Season 1 of DYNASTY was intelligent and great, even if it was a little slowly-paced and not quite as splashy as fans would come to expect.

Season 2 got the balance right: DYNASTY is still a legit character drama, but the glamour and pace have been amped up and rivals Krystle and Alexis would never seem more competent or as in tune as they do here... Easily, this is the defining year of the show --- it looks as if DYNASTY is perched to become the best TV series ever!

Season 3: the writing starts to go awry... things don't make sense, non-sequiturs abound, the plotting becomes an afterthought, and too much dialogue is given over to empty sentiments of love/hate and the characters telling each other how fabulous they are. Also, the misguided new static acting directive from the producers damages the performances, unnecessarily ruining the feel of many scenes.

Season 4: the 1983/84 year is cited as the peak season for the wealth-based nighttimes soaps of the '80s, and while DYNASTY's riding high in some ways, the goofy, stilted problems from the previous season continue... The very first episode of the year is really quite taut and focused, but it's all downhill from there: Joseph commits suicide after trying to kill Alexis, but the show never fully explains why he set fire to Steven's cabin with her inside it. We know it has something to do with Alexis holding secrets about Kirby's mother --- but what? She was crazy, we already know that... No matter. After Kirby makes a lame attempt at strangling Alexis, the butler's orphaned daughter agrees to marry her rapist, Adam... Then the show initiates a promising plotline about someone stalking Alexis and ransacking her penthouse suite, yet that plot is dropped and forgotten without explanation... Who was doing it??... Claudia weds Steven so Blake can't take away his child in court, then the couple promptly forgets it was a marriage of convenience...  Fallon gets taken in by a slimy slice of Eurotrash, Peter DeVilbis, inexplicably cast with the corpse-like Helmut Berger whose lines appear to be dubbed or shoulda been. When she realizes she's been had by this nasally mumbling opportunist, she runs into traffic and gets one of those Carrington Family Headaches the show seems so fond of; in fact, the headaches get so bad, she suddenly realizes she's loved Jeff Colby all along and wants to remarry him for no convincing reason... Blake's public-relations girl, Tracy Kendall, decides the way to get back at Krystle for taking the promotion she's hoped for is to seduce Krystle's husband in the most lazily-staged, pathetically transparent attempts imaginable... Alexis gets a new boyfriend, the effetely macho Dex Dexter, who just waltzes into her office, lays a kiss on her, and they're together forever! Only their relationship will never make any sense until Season 9 (which is a long time to wait, I'm tellin' ya!)... The cast actually goes to film in Denver for the only time in the series' history, but it remains inside the entire time, ignoring the opportunity to obtain any exterior location footage whatsoever... Diahann Carroll shows up at the end of the year to make a now-obligatory Mysterious Entrance, and she never gets anything else to do for the next three years except hand her brother, Blake, the occasional check to ""save my company, dammit!"" as she's apparently now his banker.

Nothing goes anywhere. The writers no longer seem to have a story they feel compelled to tell.

At least Alexis briefly takes on a sultry, smokey-voiced sense of her own statured coolness for Season 4, causing her to seem like the only person in the Rocky Mountains who might have even a clue as to what they're actually doing --- although her spontaneous Dietrich solo rountine in a cowboy bar to seal some nonsensical oil deal doesn't go far in proving it.

Oh, how good this show seemed to be a just couple of years earlier! For it is unrecognizable now. Only the diamonds and cashmere are of acceptable quality.

3770439,5,B001QU9RRK,"I HAVE NOT YET BOUGHT THIS SEASON/VOLUME. BUT APPARENTLY PARAMOUNT IS GOING TO INSIST ON MILKING THE CONSUMERS. AS OTHER CONSUMERS, WHO HAVE BOUGHT UP TO SEASON 4 KNOW, SEASONS 1 & 2 WERE NOT SOLD IN VOLUMES. WHAT IS REALLY AGGRAVATING IS THAT THE CONSUMERS SEEM TO BE WAITING FOR THE SEASONS TO BE RELEASED ABOUT AS LONG AS THE SERIES WAS ON TELEVISION. NINE SEASONS! I FIGURE SINCE THIS IS ""2009"" AND ONLY SEASON 4, VOLUME 1 HAS BEEN RELEASED, WE MAY HAVE THE ENTIRE SERIES BY THE END OF ""2014."" THAT WILL PUT ME AROUND THE SAME AGE ""JOAN COLLINS"" WAS WHEN THE SERIES ENDED. THE SERIES FINALE WAS ON ""MAY 11, 1989."" HER BIRTHDAY WAS EXACTLY 12 DAYS LATER.

I BELIEVE THIS SERIES FIRST SEASON BECAME AVAILABLE IN ""APRIL, 2005."" I DIDN'T BUY IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. BUT THEN, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL ""AUGUST 14, 2007"" FOR SEASON 2. BOY, WAS I EXCITED. THIS SEASON INTRODUCES ""ALEXIS"" AND ""JOAN COLLINS"" BECOMES A ""HOUSEHOLD NAME"" BUT NOW I AM BEGINNING TO GET IRRITATED. I KNOW THAT SOME OTHER SERIES ARE BEING RELEASED EVEN SLOWER THAN ""DYNASTY."" SO WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH THE EXTRA TORTURE OF DEALING WITH VOLUMES?

SEASON 4 OPENS WITH ""KRYSTAL"" AND AN UNCONSCIOUS ""ALEXIS"" TRAPPED IN A BURNING CABIN. I WON'T SPOIL IT FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT REMEMBER WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT BY REVEALING IT HERE, BUT I WILL SAY IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A SURPRISE WHEN I FIRST SAW THE EPISODE. THIS SEASON ALSO INTRODUCES ""DOMINIQUE"" AND ""DEXTER.""

FOR ALL OF YOU WHO SAW ALL OF THOSE ""BEACH MOVIES"" FROM THE ""60'S"" WOULD RECOGNIZE ""DEXTER"" AS ONE OF THE BEACH FRIENDS OF ""FRANKIE AND ANNETTE'S.""
HE APPEARED IN EVERY LAST SINGLE ONE OF THOSE, EXCEPT ""BACK TO THE BEACH.""
HE ALSO APPEARED IN THE ""GIDGET"" SERIES THAT STARRED ""SALLY FIELDS"" IN THE ""60'S."" I BET HE IS STILL TRYING TO LIVE THOSE ""BEACH MOVIES"" DOWN.

I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST GORGEOUS WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM ON ""DYNASTY"" AND I KEPT LOOKING AT HIM. THEN AS IT TRADITIONALLY WAS DONE, ALL OF THOSE MOVIES AIRED OVER AN ENTIRE WEEK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AND WHEN I SAW DEXTER'S NAME AMONG THE CAST: ""MICHAEL NADER"" I SAID ""BINGO."" AND JUST LIKE ""MICHAEL NADER"" HE WASN'T THE ONLY ""DYNASTY"" CAST MEMBER TO APPEAR IN ONE OF THOSE MOVIES. ""LINDA EVANS"" APPEARED TOO IN ""BEACH BLANKET BINGO"" PLAYING A CHARACTER CALLED: ""SUGAR CANE.""

IN SEASON 4 OF ""DYNASTY"" ""ALEXIS"" BEGINS TO SPORT SHORT HAIR. SHE HAD SWITCHED FROM LONGER WIGS TO SHORT WIGS. SHE LATER ADMITTED THAT INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF WASHING, CONDITIONING AND FUSSING WITH HER HAIR EVERYDAY, SHE SIMPLY WORE WIGS AND SHE USED THE BURNING CABIN AS A REASON TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SUDDENLY SHORT HAIR, SAYING THAT IT HAD BEEN SINGED OFF.

THIS IS ALSO THE SEASON THAT JOSEPH LEAVES THE SHOW AND SO DOES ""MARK JENNINGS,"" ""KYSTAL'S"" FORMER HUSBAND. HE WENT OFF TO JOIN ""THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"" {I BELIEVE I HAVE HIM PLACED ON THE CORRECT DAYTIME SOAP} KRYSTAL ALSO REMARRIES BLAKE AND ""THE BLAKE AND ALEXIS WAR"" WAGED ON. ALSO KIRBY GOES AFTER ALEXIS, DEXTER BECOMES INTERESTED IN ALEXIS AND BLAKE GET A SHOCKING SURPRISE. THIS IS AN EXCITING SEASON. BUT THE SEASON I'M REALLY HOLDING OUT FOR IS SEASON 5.

To all Dynasty-fans and customers of these sets:
please keep in mind, that Paramount is doing a VERY GREAT job with the picture quality here, they do really CARE to give us the best possible quality!! That needs time and costs money, people don't work for free. I don't think at all, that they want to squeeze as much money out of us, as they can, just put the Dynasty DVDs into your player and watch - or better say - ENJOY the result. And THEN compare that to the cheap quality of WB's Dallas-releases. Then you know why Dallas on DVD ist faster and cheaper... because it looks like crap!
I don't want Dynasty to look like that, and i'm realistic enough to know, that releasing Dynasty in such a brilliant picture and sound quality needs time and costs something. Needless to say, that Dynasty is a series with glitz and glam and DESERVES it to be released at best possible quality. They only don't want us not to wait too long, restauring the picture quality needs a lot of time, so they give us the half season already, when it is done, to we don't have to wait so long for the full season! Please don't give up that great high standard quality Paramount, your excellent work is really appreciated all over the world! Please continue like this, i'm a really huge fan of that show and the way you are doing this, is the right one. DYNASTY deserves it. Many thanks from germany :-)

Steven continues to struggle with his homsexuality and Dex Dexter arrives in Denver, stealing Alexis' heart. Adam continues his evil ways and this marks the final season for Fallon as Pamela Sue Martin wanted out of her contract.

I recently pre-purchased Dallas part 11 and all episodes are intact on one dvd set. As was the preious 10 seasons before that. I wanted to relive the Dynasty Saga and found that they are splitting up in season 3 volumn 1 and two. And so on and so on. Why? So they can make more money off me? Its not right so I guess I won't be watching them anymore. I am not cheap, I have collected other series in cluding The Shield, Married with Children, Sopranos and Sex in the City among others and have not felt cheated by spending my money on them. I guess it does not matter.. It is only my opinion... Janice",1235520000,7,713,4.1
3770497,2,B001QU9RRK,"I think it absolutely ludicrous that there is such a furor over this 20 plus year old series not being released completely.  Please, don't take that wrong as I too have JUST gotten into the Dynasty craze.  I watched the first 3 seasons for FREE on AOL Video.  I feel that eventually the rest of the seasons will show up there too.  Certainly, I wish that the studio would release the entire series on DVD as they certainly are making NO money holding the shows in their vaults...and if they wait much longer people are going to say ""Dynasty WHO????"".  I think this corporation thinks it is Disney!  If they were not so greedy they could sell each and every SEASON for 15.00 and STILL make a fortune.  That is why I will sit back and wait until someone puts it up to watch for free.  Maybe if everyone that wants this release so badly were to write the studio something would get done!",1233619200,4,884,4.347560975609756
3770498,5,B001QU9RRK,"Ok, I love Dynasty and I will pay almost twice as much for it than the cost of ""Dallas"".

I Accept the fact it will cost more.  And I although may feel it's overpriced I am willing to pay the extra ransom money to get this series released.

HOWEVER, this Split Season garbage HAS to stop.  We're not morons (well maybe I am for feeling like I am paying double the price, but it's a free world, I know) and we all realize Paramount is trying to get almost twice as much for one season - WE KNOW THAT!  Not sure I'd pay outrageous full Retail price of $74 to get one season, but will pay the $26 per volume sale price.  Yeah, still sounds like a rip-off, but face it, we're screwed here.  We either pay up or don't, and never see the release of this show on DVD.  I know in that case some would rather it never get released, and I do not fault you for not buying.  I too was mega irked.  But, I really DO wanna see the entire series.

So, Paramount, we know the deal here.  For pete's sake, please let those of us willing to pay the price have the opportunity to BUY the entire season at once, view it without waiting another 6 months for a release that will take up a little more room on a crowded shelf.  Jeez, one  season a year?  Gimme a break.",1233187200,5,1246,4.0285714285714285
