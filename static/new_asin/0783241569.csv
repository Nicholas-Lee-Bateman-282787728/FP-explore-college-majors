61923,5,0783241569,"I loved Notting Hill, it was very romantic. So I decided to buy it. And I watch it again & again. And I will recommend it to all my friends. Because, this is a film you can watch with the one you love.",943315200,2,201,3.697674418604651
61924,5,0783241569,"This movie by far surpassed my expectations for it.  It was funny and sad all in one.  It got you laughing and crying.  It was definately a ""chickflick"" but hey, aren't those the best kinds?",943228800,2,190,4.371428571428571
61925,5,0783241569,"This movie has now moved into the position of being the movie I have watched the most times.  The more I watch it the more I see.  I don't know what the writer, director and producer intended but I think the muse was at  work on this one.  To me the sceen where Julia is telling Hugh that she is  just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her is the soul  surrendering to the beloved.  All pretense is gone and only love is  desired.  And the love in their eyes at the end of the movie as well as the  sceen on the park bench. The sufis say anything can lead us to the beloved.  This film is doing a real good job of that for me.",942710400,2,647,3.789473684210526
61926,5,0783241569,I loved this movie and it's definitely a must see for anyone whose a sucker for romance. Hugh Grant shines as the blissful sweethearted  character that he plays best. Julia Roberts is beautiful for her  simplicity. The supporting actors could carry the performance alone. It is  wonderful to say the least!,941068800,,306,4.96078431372549
61927,5,0783241569,"You don't even want to know how many times I saw this movie in the theatre!  The performances in this movie are absolutely classic!  It's a bit of a fantasy tale, but that's really what movies are about.  It's  really nice to be able to get away to this bit of London.  The entire cast  is great!  Thanks to Richard Curtis for getting this into a screenplay.  Rent this movie!!  Have a great time!",939427200,,397,4.256756756756757

61955,5,0783241569,"Five WINSOME Stars. Since I first saw the romantic comedy Notting Hill, I enjoy it more and more each time.  I caught the last half of it on the Showtime movie channel initially and finally saw the front end to get the sweep of the entire movie. In the plot, a bookstore owner in London happens to accidentally meet a movie star and the storyline takes off from there, populated by some memorable supporting character actors, creating lots of chuckles, some laugh out loud scenes, and several touching moments. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are fabulous, interacting nicely and believably. Also starring Richard McCabe, Rhys Ifans, James Dreyfus, Dylan Moran. Directed by Roger Michell. For an unpretentious romantic comedy, its a winner. Highly Recommended. Five CHARMING Stars. (Rated PG-13. Color. HD. CC. Time-2 hours and 5 minutes. Showtime Channel.)",1509062400,,854,5.143884892086331

61976,5,0783241569,"Great movie with humor amidst both a forward and backward hubris. This smart and warm and FOCUSED comedy never strays afoul of its leading characters Will Thacker (Hugh Grant), an unassuming and apologetically mannered Brit travel bookshop owner in Notting Hill, and megastar actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), who yearns for quiet and real moments where nothing is being asked of her other than to be part of a relationship that demands nothing more than she spend time and affection on it in-between the unreality of her movie star life. The seemingly forward hubris of Thacker reaching beyond what many might see as his station in landing the gorgeous icon of cinema in Scott is equally matched by the backward hubris of her seemingly stooping down to fall for a commoner, and one who runs a less-than-successful bookshop that only sells travel books at that! But as in any good romantic comedy love puts to shame lifes stations and conquers imaginary ceilings. Both Grant and Roberts have genuine on-screen chemistry and are very easy with each other but the fairly brilliant largely British cast, most of whom comprise different elements of Thackers family, all make their small parts feel large and lived in. As a guy who mostly digs action and adventure and science fiction and fantasy movies Ive dodged my fair share of romances but when one this good comes along theres no denying it.",1502496000,,1394,4.911016949152542

62014,5,0783241569,There is nothing I love more than when an actor can make fun of their own persona and Julia Roberts does it to perfection.

62287,5,0783241569,Very good.,1482883200,,10,4.5
62288,5,0783241569,"For so many actresses... talent and beauty even... simply does not put them above the rest of their profession, Julia Roberts for about 12 or so years ... was this character... a beautiful girl but too radiant...  inside and more... something that most people recognized as a kind of archetype.

Which sounds perhaps like a little too much... but this strange little film is really about fame itself, loneliness, the thrill of being that person in the mass mind yet isolated.

The movie is written extremely well and many lines are memorable and almost all of them are amusing.

Hugh Grant is very good but I still think he was miscast and yet his lines are written for him specifically and his odd very funny cadence.
That casting is not so out of the loop that one can not forget it but I kept thinking that... the couple's chances of stability was slime, with another English actor that might not have been the case.

There is a scene where they crawl over a fence that says it all and yet... in that scene, Julia is actually that American girl who is amused at the English version of manhood and still likes him very much. That felt real.

Because of the strange psychic place of Julia Roberts player herself... the movie on that level is fascinating and often for that, tender. Lovely romance for any person who has found themselves unexpectedly faced with overwhelming beauty right in front of them and for all who have dreamed of that situation.",1482883200,,1452,4.608527131782946

62330,4,0783241569,"A great date movie with a concept maybe not exactly unique, but uniquely done. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, a movie star riding a tide of popularity (very similar to Robert's career at the time), who falls for a modest travel book store owner, William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant. The obstacles are obvious; how can two people from very separate worlds make a relationship work when fame and stardom get in the way?
The movie is excellently done for the most part, carried by the weight of the stars own abilities with no unnecessary nudity sex scenes or action bits or attention deficit hyperactivity you find in movies these days. British humor shows through in the film and gives it charm, though it sometimes detracts being overly embellished. The biggest detraction may be one of the co-stars, Rhys Ifans, who plays the nit-wit roommate Spike who lives with William. From what I heard, he was very popular in England at the time, but while the innocently mischievous character may have played well for that audience, for North American audiences it may be too annoying at times. But overall it's a heartfelt movie about trying to find that common ground in any relationship, and I think it does.",1482796800,2,1205,4.798076923076923

62948,4,0783241569,"Oh Rom Coms...they lure us into their fantasy world and so does this one. Everyone is funny, witty, lovable and supportive. There are hilarious and poignant moments and quotable lines (""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her""). When done right with confident actors like Roberts and Grant, it's a warm and comfy ride with a happy ending to the tune of a gorgeous song sung by Elvis Costello.  Synopsis: Regular lovable guy rescues famous actress who is at a personal crossroads in her life. Though drawn to him she holds back and ends up treating him dismissively. But when she needs to escape bad press she runs to him as a safe house and romance ensues, except that the press tracks her down. Feeing betrayed (erroneously), she leaves him but he realizes he has fallen in Iove and, we later realize, so has she. About 6 months later they meet again but he thinks she still disdains him (oh, those movie misunderstandings) so he leaves. She shows up at his shop and tries to reconcile (I'm just a girl...speech) but he says that it won't work. Later, with his friends, he realizes what an idiot he was and there is a mad cap dash through streets of London to crash a press conference and declare his love through a Q&A which, I confess, is adorable. Happy endings all around.",1479168000,4,1305,4.506329113924051

And the music is incredibly awful, not that the songs are particularly bad, it's just way they were assigned to the scenes are horrifying.  I rolled my eyes so many times during the movie that I think I developed a much stronger eye-rolling muscle.  And you know what, I can't really watch Hugh Grant without thinking about a BMW and blowjob anyway...  Really only reason I watched this movie is because I hadn't, and once I start something, I kind of have to finish it.  It is a cute movie, so to speak, but an exhausting movie.",1478131200,2,665,4.365853658536586

The supporting characters are terrific and the dialogue is witty and funny. The film makes a lot of statements about life and entertainment, but in a suttle and tender way. The soundtrack is fantastic. The only song I felt was out of place and over-used was Gimme Some Lovin'. There's just something that bothers me about the use of that song when they use it. It's too 'cliche' for this film. This is a high recommend.",1477785600,,571,4.5

of her unlikeable character is both annoying and unconvincing. While Grant is his usual genuine, likable self,
the emotionally noncommittal Roberts seems to feel as if just ""sitting around smiling"" is enough to carry her role. In fact, her
mostly icily cold character portrayal reflects shallow appearances rather than true authenticity. Nice big eyes, ok, we get it. But so what?
""I'm just a girl...."" who can't act for s***e.",1476316800,,528,5.451219512195122

A nice selection of British character actors whose faces you know in supporting roles do as well as can be expected with the material.  You might say the same of Hugh Grant; Julia Roberts does less well, but her role may be the more ridiculous and thus the more difficult.  She does try to do a lot of acting with her eyebrows and nostrils.  They go heavy handed with the pop soundtrack too, its just too much.  How did they ever get Elvis Costello to do that ridiculously sappy song at the beginning and the end?  I just lost a little respect for one of my musical idols.",1475884800,,632,4.396551724137931

63464,5,0783241569,A gentle romantic comedy that has all the pieces for a 5-star rating.  BothJulia Roberts and Hugh Grant underplay their roles  in such a way that they are not only believable but even the average movie goer with average life experience can insert themselves into those roles and have it feel normal.

Now I hear a perfectly ridiculous song that begins and ends the movie, idealizing a less than ideal female, in a movie about a relationship that's highly unlikely to work out for long. Frankly, when someone's been a complete bitch to you more than twice, why would you put yourself on the line yet again?  Sounds more like a romantic dream than real love.  It's still worth seeing just for Emma Chambers, the male lead's younger sister, Honey (think Vicar of Dibley), and for the honest and funny interactions among the other members of his family.",1475452800,,594,4.6826923076923075

63589,4,0783241569,"You know where this is going from the beginning. Standard romantic comedy fare. But I enjoy the diffident Hugh Grant, never more so than in this role, and the side cast of quirky characters makes this a pleasant way to spend some time vegging out. The roommate character is what moves this from an average 3 star rating to about a 3 1/2 star film (couldn't figure out how to do half stars.)",1474848000,,390,4.3561643835616435

63601,4,0783241569,It's a good movie because it shows the opposite side of typical movies. Usually a female is a weaker character in a typical movie. Notting Hill is the opposite.,1474675200,,160,4.551724137931035

63603,2,0783241569,Why is this an iconic film? It's ridiculous. Roberts character has no element of believability and her performance is entirely lack-luster.

Ultimately the line that Anna apparently wrote for herself ""just a girl asking a boy to love her"" was the deciding factor in the story.",1473552000,,424,4.943661971830986

63941,2,0783241569,"TL;DR Hugh Grant is charming as usual and has some funny lines, but I don't see the draw to Julia Roberts in this one.

This is supposed to be a romantic comedy where the unlikely pair of main characters are cosmically drawn to each other. The problem is I just don't buy the characters attraction to each other, which the whole movie hinges on. He's a little charming but she relies on her fame to keep him interested, with very little substance. The best movies like this make the viewer fall for the lead, the mediocre ones at least get you to root for the couple. With this not only was I not rooting for the couple, I wanted Hugh Grant to realize his infatuation with Roberts because of her fame was unfounded and find his real true love.

Grant provides a little comedy, as does his disgusting flatmate (though he made me angry more times than made me laugh). I didn't personally find any of the other supporting characters appealing, although it was cool to see a young Hugh Bonneville (from Downton Abbey). I liked seeing sights around London since I am visiting there soon; otherwise the movie was disappointing.",1459728000,4,1121,4.5721393034825875

Kind of trashy the way she cheats or almost cheats on her boyfriend (no matter how sleazy he is portrayed) and says the nastiest things to the Hugh Grant character. Realistically, no man would stand that for it. I can't judge others for loving this movie though because some people don't understand my positive feelings for Love, Actually.

But I happened to read a New Yorker review the other day that was quite favorable. The New Yorker rarely bites on a contemporary ROMCOM, so I thought I'd give it a try. Lo and behold, it's really charming. Hugh is unexpectedly likeable. And of course, Julia Roberts is even better than normal as a huge Hollywood star who is burning out at a rapid pace. Check it out!

One interesting question: Don't want to spoil it, but Julia's nasty boyfriend, who appears in only one scene, is a famous actor known for his nastiness. But he doesn't appear in the credits!",1431302400,,659,4.53781512605042

There is a scene in the movie where she is surrounding by this group of friends that only knew her as a a big movie star, but in the end, treat her like she is part of group.  You can see the glow in her face knowing they are there, just to be her friends.  And Julia nails that scene.  And nobody smiles like her.

64085,4,0783241569,My wife wanted to watch this and since nothing else seemed that interesting I agreed to give it a try. This film exceeded my expectations. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are charming in this romantic comedy set in the Notting Hill district of England. The plot is improbable but that doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable. The supporting cast of characters are a motley assortment who provide just the right common touch to an otherwise fanciful film. Enjoyed it.,1420761600,,465,4.825

James Deyfus is outstanding as the assistant shop keeper!  He has great gestures as funny as his lines.  Ryes Ifans steals the shows playing the roommate!",1420156800,,480,5.1688311688311686

So I knew this was a DVD we would need to add to our small collection. We don't watch many movies over and over so that keeps our home collection quite small and manageable. But when I find one that not only I enjoyed, but my husband enjoyed with it, I know it's time to own my own copy. The chemistry between Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts in this movie is amazing. I feel it has something to do with being set in England. Something about the backgrounds and backscapes and the people all draw you in and you want to see more. The friendships that circle around William are something to envy. You can tell these people would do anything for each other.

This is a movie for the ages! I highly recommend it.",1411603200,,855,4.089285714285714

She had to explain that we were watching actors convey what it would REALLY be like for an ordinary man to try to date a super-star celebrity actress - and vice versa.  I had to ponder this after the fact and think I may watch it again.  It brought back bad memories of being 15 and trying to date girls everyone whom appeared to have a higher celebrity rank than me.  :)  It is always fun to watch Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant act so effortlessly.

64224,5,0783241569,"This film's been one of my favorites for a long time. This was back when Hugh Grant was basically doing every non-Jane Austen British romantic comedy that was ever made.

I originally wasn't a fan of Julia Roberts in the film but over time I've warmed to her in this. This is one of those films where the romance part is really secondary to the characters and how they all interact and play off each other. It's well told and besides, you get Rhys Ifans who is great here.

Ultimately, it's a charming film with an odd premise with an array of characters that just work. I love the performances and the setting. I think if you're looking for a light film that isn't too formulaic and doesn't have the gag-inducing ""perfect"" characters pretending to be imperfect sort of shake-n-bake type of plot, you can't go wrong.",1406592000,,816,4.54421768707483

We have the VHS of this movie, but found the DVD resolution much better and the widescreen doesn't cut off the sides of the scenes like the VHS does.  This DVD was sold and fulfilled by Amazon.  It is really good and enjoyable!  This has become one of our favorite movies.

For serious Christians who do not want to hear their Savior's name taken in vain, there are three places to mute the sound on the DVD (the times on the VHS are a little different).  Using the counter on your player:  @ 34' 27"" at his best friend's house for his sister's birthday party, before  his friend opens the oven right after the wife says ""He didn't say"" (MUTE SOUND DURING THIS SCENE), and @ 1:08' 40"" Spike walks into the flat (MUTE SOUND DURING THIS SCENE), and @1:22' 08"" Hugh opens the door and sees all the cameras (MUTE SOUND DURING THIS SCENE).

64328,5,0783241569,"What happens when an ordinary guy and a famous movie star are attracted to each other?  If they are Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts they fall in love. But the path to true love is fraught with complications = that rather than being forced flow naturally from the two different worlds that the hero and heroine inhabit.  Julia Roberts gives one of her best performances as Anna Scott, an actress who is well aware of the cost of fame.  At one point Anna notes that she's been on a diet since she was nineteen which means she's been hungry for ten years, that every time she gets her heart broken by one of the self-centered boyfriends she's attracted to (Alex Baldwin gives a great cameo as an exemplar) the newspapers bandy it about as entertainment.  That someday she'll be middle-aged and look a bit like someone who was famous for awhile.  Julia Roberts gives an understated performance in which she remarkably conveys that movie stars are people too.  Hugh Grant's charm and normality attract her as well as that of his diverse collection of oddball friends, but nevertheless there are numerous pitfalls before the inevitable, but perfect ending in which they are finally brought together.  The movie is enhanced by a talented cast of secondary characters who embody British eccentricity in its myriad forms.  The movie is sometimes criticized for being unrealistic -- which of course it is.  But why do we go to movies after all?  If we want realism we can stay home on Saturday afternoon and mop the floor!

64341,4,0783241569,"I bought this film because I had just watched Hugh Grant in ""About A Boy"" and decided he wasn't always the stumbling nincompoop I thought he was.  In seeing ""Notting Hill"" again, I remembered what I disliked the first time:  Julia Roberts' superstar character is unquestionably challenged by her circumstances and lack of privacy, but she is for the most part a self-indulgent brat.  Boo-hoo that she's so rich and famous that her private life is compromised!  It's hard to forgive her when she goes rabid on genuinely-in-love Grant because his nincompoop roommate, brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans, leaks her presence in their flat to the press; and again, when she falls completely apart over having nude pictures of her spread before the eyes of the world.  Maybe the lack of credibility of this latter issue is due to the passage of time, as such problems are far less worrisome in today's world than they were when the film hit the big screen.
  That said, Roberts' character reveals snippets of the woman beneath the mask, and since we're rooting for Grant, is ultimately acceptable.  It's a fluffy and unlikely love story peopled with wonderful supporting performances.

We'll throw in a like bunch of eccentric, funny friends, some pathos (someone wheelchair bound, a celebrity with no privacy, whatever), a mad, comic rush through London traffic, and the obligatory warm/fuzzy wedding scene at the end, it can't miss!""

I HATE being manipulated, having my chain so shamelessly jerked.  I left a review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-ve-Got-Mail/dp/B001N3LLH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You've Got Mail</a>&nbsp;some time back, noting some of the same tendencies, but I didn't mind quite as much because it succeeded, OK, you GOT me (palpable chemistry between Meg Ryan & Tom Hanks, for one thing)- but this movie DIDN'T get me, just too much to overcome.  For starters, almost no chemistry between Roberts and Grant (largely the lacklustre script's fault, a good script could've generated some). Love 'em both, but not here, together (odd how two people sans chemistry become LESS than the sum of their parts).

Julia Roberts hasn't nearly enough to do, MANY reaction shots, tremulous, tearful smile after tremulous tearful smile [SIMPERING]- Please!  Go in for all the closeups you want of her ""enchanting"" smile, I (and Hugh Grant) need more than THAT to fall in love.  And, we're to believe she's a stunning beauty.  She's not- wonderful, lovely, engaging, definitely, like no-one else, but a great, classic beauty she isn't.  Most importantly, she has FEW decent lines, character development is sadly lacking.  WHY is she with brute Alec Baldwin (whom she whines about, and incidentally, LIES about)?  Plus she alludes to other abusive relationships, past heartbreak, but no details or explanations are forthcoming.  She's a mega-star, one of the wealthiest and most sought-after women in the world, and we're to pity her...WHY?  There are MANY problems with the script, too many to list.  Just one example: they overhear some blokes in a restaurant saying she's a cheap tart, Grant steps up to defend her honor, what does she do?  Makes an insulting comment about the size of their penises(!)- yeah, that should do it- ""SO sorry, our mistake- you're a class act after all.""  Hardly.

Julia drops in on Hugh Grant whenever it suits her fancy (on the flimsiest of pretexts), flirts, kisses, even makes love to him, and then disappears again; every time (except one) he is delighted to see her, smitten, regardless of what she's done or why, how she uses him, an utter doormat.  At one point we're supposed to feel sorry for her because she did naked photo shoots and possibly some porn early on, that have since surfaced, damaging her reputation, and what's more, GRANT is supposed to feel sympathetic about it, and incredibly, DOES.  And BTW, he's the proprietor of a small bookshop, but never seems to be minding the store.  Roberts's mood swings make little sense, they're mere plot contrivances, and lousy ones at that.  The highly contrived press conference scene (supposed to be the affecting emotional slam dunk, with cloying closeups of their patently ingratiating smiles) left me COLD- PLEASE.  What would this spineless doormat and shallow narcissist find so irresistible about each other?

Maybe if I thought about it real hard, or, had a better imagination, I could think that the underlying theme of the film is that a jaded female star, hardened by years of being in the tough, crass film industry, is redeemed by the love of a good man.  But if this was the case it was too subtle for me to see, to feel, should have been played up much more.  If it had, the press conference scene could've been a powerful one in which she's overcome by the fact that someone really, truly loves her, a miracle.  As it was, such an assumption would be pure wishful thinking, because there wasn't enough to base it on, not enough meat, enough meaningful interaction between the two.  Roberts should have been more off-kilter, Grant firmer, more forceful, less tolerant of her movie-star sensibilities and egocentric ways.  Then, when they came together it would've been more powerful, more meaningful, for me anyway.  As it was, I think too much time was devoted to comic elements, plus, too much of an effort was made to make both main characters ""likable"" and appealing, and the filmmakers were largely unsuccessful on both counts.

If there's any reason to see this it might be Hugh Grant, as charismatic and winsome as always (though perhaps a little tired, and as I say, lacking in testosterone).  There are a few funny and endearing moments- the Horse and Hound bit, the personalities of the great supporting actors who play Grant's friends and family (who overcome the material they're given, shine in spite of it, to their credit).

64417,4,0783241569,"Notting Hill is a standard romantic comedy saved from its predictability by good acting and dashes of clever writing. We know the formula: guy meets girl; guy loses girl; guy seeks to win her back. A new spin on the win-lose-win plot comes from Julia Roberts's playing a world-famous actress (not unlike herself) dodging the paparazzi that follow her about like a plague of summertime gnats. Unlike Roberts, though, this actress somehow derives her A rating in the fame department by making cheesy B movies (perhaps her science fiction movie role embodies an allusion to Jane Fonda as Barbarella?), but we suspend disbelief and move onward. Hugh Grant once again wears an almost indecently thin veil of humility over his beaming good looks & charm. He is a humble shopkeeper selling travel books--or, sometimes, for comic relief, not selling them to people unable to understand why a travel bookstore would not carry Dickens--and he lives in a charming little town within London in a townhouse with a blue door about a thousand yards from the shop. He is coasting through life until the pivotal moment when Roberts walks into his shop and sets the plot in motion. Among the predatory Olympian stunts of famous actors, official Hollywood ""romances,"" elaborately feigned publicity poses, and the locust plague of clattering camera shutters, Grant is the innocent mortal tossed about by forces beyond his comprehension. He finally gets hurt one time too many--though why Roberts should choose such a callous line to deny his friendship when she doesn't know Grant is listening is another under-explained mystery that strains credibility--but onward we move to the most memorable line in the film, which Roberts delivers in perfect pitch as she tells Grant that behind the fame she is just a girl asking a boy to love her. Perhaps with less Olympic talent the movie would fallen flat, but Roberts and Grant make us want to suspend all the disbelief in the world and move straight ahead to the fairy tale ending. Grant's milieu of friends, family, and a delightfully eccentric Welsh roommate stands on the shoulders of a talented ensemble, and I find myself wishing I could know more about their characters and lives. I normally watch heavier more serious stuff--I was raised on Ingmar Bergman--but when I'm in the mood for something light and sweet, this movie is a delight.",1390262400,,2370,4.987373737373737

It is true that in many cases the French dubbing gives something more to Anglo-Saxon films. In Notting Hill, the work is amazing. For a dwarf , Hugh Grant has an extraordinarily masculine voice . Other men who hang around him are larger , bigger or more beefy than him, they will never be able to find a voice with a semblance of authority.

It begins with the thief in his shop , a bad kid caught in the act and receiving a good lesson. Then there is the odd roommate , good caricature of everything English culture can generate of grotesque eccentricities ( punk, rock and roll, new wave ... )

Hugh is a brave little pug with a voice of Saint Bernard who has the audacity to seduce a beautiful American actress. He will invite her to a dinner with friends and we will realize that ultimately she is like everyone!",1386547200,,989,4.364130434782608

Rhys Ifans is justifiably praised, but  look at the rest of this superb cast - Hugh Bonneville, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, James Dreyfus and even a brief walk on by Emily Mortimer as ""perfect girl."" Each character turns in a sterling performance that transforms an otherwise ho-hum affair between Grant and Roberts into a 5 star, capital M, Movie that's worth watching and re-watching. Rom-coms, from Pride and Prejudice onward, have to have a great supporting cast to overcome the limits of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.

The BR disc itself has an excellent crisp video transfer - it doesn't seem to be a new HD master but it looks great. The features are the same as those on the earlier DVD.

The movie is unfairly dismissed or pigeonholed as just another Julia Roberts rom-com, but this movie is so much more. A well written, bittersweet romance with solid performances all around. Although the movie ( like writer Richard Cutris' Love Actually ) does take place in fantasy land, Curtis realizes this and manages to tweak conventions enough to make it fresh and delightful. Roberts' character is not a fairy princess but instead is a pretty unlikable hothead, and the script deals with that. Grant's everyman is understandably overwhelmed to find a movie star falling for him ( and he for her ), and finds out that true love is messy and hard and intoxicating all at once.

Julia Roberts plays the most famous movie actress of the day, Anna Scott, who happens to visit William Thacker's (Hught Grant's) quaint Notting Hill travel bookstore on Portobello Road.  Later they run into each other, literally, and there is some attraction.  However, their lifestyles are clearly not in sync.

Will true love overcome these difficulties?  This movie is quite humorous and provides insight into the challenges of being famous.  What's fun about the movie, besides the characters, is the authentic Notting Hill setting where the film was filmed.  And the interiors of some of the hotels used in the movie are delicious - it's a visual delight.  It's very entertaining when you want to escape to London and see the life and love of a movie star and her unknown bookstore owner. 4.5 stars",1379289600,,916,4.980263157894737

64537,4,0783241569,"Julia Roberts movies are (to me) either very, very good (like Pretty Woman) or stinkers (like Runaway Bride). The same for Hugh Grant.

So when my wife checked this out at the library I wasn't overly enthusiastic to watch it. However since we, usually, watch what I want to it was only fair that I agreed to watch this with her.

I'm glad I agreed.

This a nicely done, understated, movie. It tells the tale of a man who owns a bookstore (Hugh Grant) who falls in love with a big movie star (Julia Roberts) who ducks into his store mostly to avoid the paparazzi. He is star struck at being so close to such a beautiful and famous woman.

Two scenes have stayed with me - the one after she spent the night the first time - this was very well done and allowed us to have some fun via his goofy roommate - Rhys Ifans as Grant's scene-stealing, slovenly friend.

The other is where he visits her on-site for a outdoors scene. The sound guys give him some earphones to listen in for the dialog since he is only allowed to be so close to where they are shooting. When he hears what she says about him is heart-wrenching and very well done.

But, of course, it ends happily as most Hollywood productions but even the frantic chase to the hotel is fun.

I would give this a very solid 8.0 to 8.5 out of 10.

*******************************************************************************

And now for a shameless plug - my daughter had a small part in The Lil' River Rats and the Adventure of the Lost Treasure. Originally she had a much bigger role but the director/producer went through a divorce which delayed things for more than 2 years. So the movie was recast as the original kids were deemed too old. My daughter was the only one kept but she was given a much smaller part with only about 5 lines (and I believe 2 of those were cut).

This movie was sold at Target last Christmas for $5.99. It is NOT a good movie - it could have been but just wasn't. I would rate it around a 4.5 or so on a 10 point scale. My daughter is the one wearing a blue shirt who gets hit with a water balloon dropped by a remote controlled helicopter. I was there for that scene and it took 10 or 12 takes as they couldn't get the balloon to burst when hitting her. We finally scotch taped a tack to her forehead to get the balloon to burst when it was supposed to. That did the trick and we got the take they needed. I actually read for the sheriff role - actually filmed a couple of scenes but then they found a radio personality which meant FREE advertising on local radio.

The reason I'm telling you is all of this is if they sell 10,000 more copies by Labor Day they will have enough cash to make another with her as a high school girls basketball player.

Two problems with the movie: 1) too much sugar, generally, and 2) Hugh Grant.  His infinitely diffident schtick works pretty well in the early going, as she is the grand celebrity and he is the man on the street; however as soon as he makes an overtly sexual move, and certainly after the initial sex, he needs to change gears--get to something more basic in his maleness--and he doesn't. This does not mean a radical transformation, he can still be sensitive, empathetic, etc., but we really need a new tonality at that point, and he doesn't provide it. That seems to me the biggest problem with the film, makes it seem just ""a movie,"" something inherently unreal, rather than a window into a potential real world.",1372636800,,888,4.566037735849057

The good news is that she sticks with this demeanor and makes it work for her as the forbidding celebrity looking for down-to-earth true love and willing to sacrifice for it.

If the author wants the viewer to believe any of this he should have emphasized that the painting Anna gave Will is an original and she brought it from the US with intentions of giving it to him and making amends (when she sees a print of it at his house earlier in the movie she could have said she has it at home!) then again, it's her last day of filming so when was she intending to give it to him anyway? And why wait until she's filming in Britain again, when it's convenient, why not make a special trip?

Its a wacky British drama that is totally unrealistic and not very believable.  I was glad when it was over.  No movie star is going to pick up a book seller in England and then marry them.

64610,4,0783241569,"What would you do if the world's most famous movie star walked through your door and the two of you fell madly in love with each other? That's the question, screen writer, Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"", ""Bridget Jones'Diary"") attempts to answer in the light-hearted, 1999 film, ""Notting Hill"".

For those who don't know, Richard Curtis is the King of the 'Romantic Brit-Com', genre. This is a genre of usually small budget, comedic films that are about the romantic lives of good looking Brits (usually with a close group of witty, quirky, supportive friends), who must overcome self-doubt and bad timing to make true love happen. A good number of these movies star Hugh Grant and have been written (and sometimes directed) by Mr. Curtis.

In this romatic comedy the setting is the trendy, old London neighborhood of Notting Hill. The streets are filled with vendors and lined with interesting little shops. William Thacker (Hugh Grant) runs a tiny, dusty book store, that sells only travel books. Both William's professional and romantic life seems stagnant and on hold. That is until  movie superstar, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) discreetly pokes her head into his shop. At first Anna seems wary of William. But soon the two can't deny that they have a definite attraction for each other. The film follows over a period of time, Anna popping in and out of William's life. The pressures and circumstances of stardom & celebrity always seeming to get in the way, leaving poor William's romantic hopes dashed. Luckily he has a group of witty, quirky, supportive friends to get him through the tough times. Can't an ordinary fellow have a romantic relationship with the world's most famous movie star?

As Richard Curtis' romantic Brit-coms go, ""Notting Hill"" is a pleasent film that will keep you entertained. In a small way the film is close in both story structure and character motivations to Curtis' first big hit ""Four Weddings & A Funeral"".(A love lorn Brit who can't romatically get it together with an American Woman, but luckily is supported by quirky, witty, friends, who have there own mini-dramas) The big difference between the two films is "" Notting Hill's"" look at celebrity life and pressures.

What really keeps the film going is both Curtis' trade mark of writing  good, endearing characters and the film's talented cast. Hugh Grant is excellent presenting a quiet, melancholy, exasperation of an unfullfilled love life. It may be type casting and not much of a stretch, but Julia Roberts as the world's most famous movie star is just perfect. She's gives a good performance making you want to believe that Anna is not only a self-obsessed celebrity, but every once in a while, ""just a girl, standing in front of boy, asking him to love her"".

This is one of those films, where the supporting players really do help make it a success. There are wonderful performances from Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina Mckee, Hugh Bonneville and James Dreyfus. If you are in any way a fan of British film & television, then you will recognize the faces of these hilarious character actors.

In the end ""Notting Hill"" turns out to be nothing more than a good old fashion love story, that has excellent characters , wonderful performances and some good laughs. Highly recommended!",1192752000,2,3297,4.927927927927928

64612,5,0783241569,"This is a charming movie that I've seen several times and will probably see again.  It's an upbeat, miracles happen, ""celebrities are people too"" kind of movie.

Boy meets girl, girl says ""NO"", then changes her mind. And keeps changing it.  Anyone who has said ""No"", when his/her heart was yelling, ""Yes Yes Yes "", can relate to this movie a lot.

One of the aspects that I found so interesting was the rigidly controlled structure under which Anna was required to live her life.  And how relentlessly she had to smile, regardless of how she was feeling.  It must be tough to have to be ""on"" so much of the time.  NOTTING HILL gave us a window into the world in which celebrities live and some of the challenges they face.

This is a heartwarming, funny movie starring 2 talented actors playing 2 really likable characters.  I have a weakness for movies with American/British romantic pairings, since Americans and Brits are culturally so different; in this movie, the plot is sweetened with the added romantic complication of wealthy/famous and not so wealthy or famous. It's a heartwarming rollicking ride !

I highly recommend Notting Hill.",1178668800,,1143,4.785714285714286
64613,5,0783241569,"Of course in real life this would not happen, at least not to me. William, owner of a small bookshop in Notting Hill, not only falls in love with a Hollywood star Anna Scott (played by Julia Roberts who is virtually playing herself), but also he really begins to go out with her. Can an ordinary guy be the true love of the star whose face covers magazines every week? Here is a one story, delightfully romantic and told with humor, about the possibility of such a romance. The story sounds implausible, but still a very good one.

Despite some incredible situations, the chemistry between the two leads makes us forget them temporarily, and their romance is enchanting (and a bit predictable) to the end. In addition to Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant (and their undeniable star power), the film is supported by gifted actors playing colorful characters; they are Gina McKee, James Dreyfus, Emma Chambers and inimitable Rhys Ifans as Spike, the most unusual lodger in London. Amusing cameos of Alec Baldwin, Matthew Modine and young Mischa Barton as child actor (like she was then) shoud not be missed.

Pleasant romantic comedy ""Notting Hill"" is written by Richard Curtis, whose works before this one include equally romantic ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and less successful ""The Tall Guy,"" both of which are based on the American-in-London situations. His script of ""Notting Hill"" is always witty, giving us some sly comments on human relations and film industry. (In fact, I am using it as the text for my English class in Japan.)

Some people may say this is not real Notting Hill (you don't see Notting Hill Carnival, for example) and probably they are right because, as I said, in real London this would not happen. It belongs to the ever-overcrowding genre of romantic comedy where romance means a lot, and in this respect ""Notting Hill"" is a success.",1176854400,,1857,4.815047021943574
64614,2,0783241569,"I had heard so many good things about this movie, but I didn't like it.  The filming and scenery were lovely, but overall I thought the story was just not a great story - mainly because the character Julia Roberts played was so self-centered and rude, according to her mood.  I had real trouble believing in any real basis for the attraction of the two main characters, especially after Julia Roberts' character had an extremely unjust and childish tantrum that rendered her character almost revolting.  At the end of the movie, I wished Hugh Grant's character had hooked up with the ""nice"" blind date, who seemed a far better person and fit.",1167609600,3,642,4.714285714285714
64615,4,0783241569,"I really don't want to like this movie,  but I do.  Unfortunately,  the things I like about it have nothing to do with the Julia Roberts character,  who can be so obnoxious that I wonder WHY William loves her so much.  She has a few moments of sweetness,  but the rest of the time she is acting ridiculous or downright unstable.  She is rude when he bends over backward to help her after the orange juice spill,  she puts him through the ridiculous charade of having to act like a journalist when he visits her at her hotel,  she invites him up to her room despite having a boyfriend,  then goes beserk on him after they sleep together when she flees to his home to escape the paparazzi.  I mean,  what kind of idiot hides from the press at a private home,  then goes to open the door herself because she wants to know ""What he's up to""?  She's so stupid she deserves to be found out hiding at his house.  Of course,  then she goes ballistic on him,  and runs out of his life after blaming the whole situation on him.  I was actually pleased when he initially refuses to resume their relationship when she comes to see him at his shop a year later.  One puts up with the obnoxious Anna Scott because Julia Roberts is so believeable,  and so enjoyable to watch,  but seriously,  why would anyone go so crazy over such an unappealing person?

  Most of what makes this movie good are the other characters.  Hugh Grant basically plays the same character in every movie,  the stammering,  awkward,  bumbling but adorable nice guy.  You can't help but like him,  and his William is such a decent man I feel he deserves far better than the neurotic Anna.  The characters around William make this movie worth watching,  and if I were Anna,  I'd stick with William just to be with them.  Spike is hilarious,  stealing every scene.  Honey,  Bella,  Max,  Bernie....just wonderful.  They make this movie sweet,  enjoyable,  and worth watching over and over again,  even if I am puzzled as to why William wastes time pining for Anna.  The music is great,  and the scene in the marketplace over a year's time is inspired.  All in all,  there are enough good points in this movie to make it worth your while,  despite the bratty American movie star.",1164412800,2,2236,4.456359102244389

Many of the so called non-boring more exciting films are really fabricated and exaggerated with extras that really bring it far away from what we should know as reality. This film, to me, was more reflecting over the boundaries of reality. Many other films add a bunch of stuff in order to draw viewers into it and give them settings and plots of occurences that flies far from what real life is about, something that doesn't happen as well in real life.

There are people that like fictional and then there are those that like non-fiction. It depends on how you view it, either you like a movie that has a bunch of totally exaggerated and made up stuff or the real life deal as this movie is.

Still, however, I thought this movie was a little boring, but interesting still to watch. As always, many things that can be done to make it more interesting, but I guess it is the way it is.

In this film she's vulnerable & tough, funny & sweet, selfish and selfless.  From her that moment at the dinner table as she fights for her brownie, to the moment where she proclaims her love to Grant telling him ""she's just a girl standing in front of a boy..."" to her anger over the invasion that one celebrity of her stature receives.

Sure, the lead stars (Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts) have some charisma, Roger Michell`s directing is smooth and subtle, the story has a couple of funny scenes and most of the (very british) cast delivers highly convincing performances. Still, this modern fairy tale about a love relationship between a movie star and an ordinary, middle class guy is not only unrealistic but also almost 100% predictable and unsurprising. The plot shows little original ideas, offering a set of cliches and ""been there, done that"" situations. ""Notting Hill"" is definitely a well made, professional product nonetheless, yet the overall result doesn`t rise above average and uninspired material, a rehash of old ideas and concepts. It`s an alright saturday-afternoon innofensive flick, providing a mildly entertaining cinematic experience that helps to pass the time.

64623,5,0783241569,"Hugh Grant's role as Travel Book Shop employee William Thacker reprises the same shy, humble, lovable, but lonely character with a small group of friends that made him a star in Four Weddings And A Funeral.  That may be because Notting Hill, like FW&AF, was written by Richard Curtis.  ""And so it was another hopeless Wednesday when I walked a thousand yards to work, not suspecting that this was going to be the day my life would be changed forever.""  In two words, that catalyst is Anna Scott, currently one of Hollywood's biggest stars, who is promoting her latest film Helix, a sci-fi film whose costume design and one interior setting owes a nod to Kubrick's 2001.  She happens in his bookshop, but that first meeting sets off a series of meetings where they spend time with each other.
Eccentric barely describes Spike, his Welsh roommate with a shock of wild blond hair.  Never have I seen a more comical opposites since Felix and Oscar of the Odd Couple.  Spike is clearly the Oscar of the pair, but then again, I doubt if Oscar would have worn a T-shirt saying, ""Get It Here"", with an arrow pointing downwards, or unwittingly mistake mayonnaise for yogurt.
In the course of meeting Anna, he in turn introduces her to his small group, including a married couple, Max and Belle, the latter in a wheelchair, a stockbroker named Bernie, and William's wild-looking sister Honey, whose bulging eyes and feathery hair makes her nevertheless lovable in a different sort of way.
However, they live in two different worlds.  As William puts it, ""I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills.""  Both have different schedules, lifestyles, and perspectives on things.  Yet his inner smile lights up whenever she pops in and spends some time with him.  And applying a metaphor used, Anna is a goddess.  ""You know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods?""  That's terrible for William, who confides in Spike that it's like ""taking love heroin and I couldn't have it again.  I've opened Pandora's Box and there's trouble inside.""
Anna is a typical box-office draw who has to put up with the tail side of the fame coin.  The many boyfriends, the laying out of her private life in the tabloids, but also how she's unable to live an ordinary life and how she has to put up with unkind words, as when she overhears a group of businessmen saying how actresses are equal to prostitutes and that she is the definitive actress.  Ouch!  But despite the fame, in the end, she's ""just a girl asking a boy to love her.""
The one pullback aerial shot that has the couple approaching the bench dedicated to a loved one, while Ronan Keating sings Keith Whitley's ""When You Say Nothing At All"" was a perfect combination of great camera work enhanced by a haunting love song.
Hugh Grant has another winning role and seems to have the knack of starring opposite great female leads and being compatible.  Be it Andie McDowell (Four Weddings) or Emma Thompson (Sense And Sensibility), he does himself and Julia Roberts great credit.  After seeing this at the theatre when it first came out, I sighed with relief that I finally found the most charming movie with Julia Roberts since Pretty Woman.  All the actors portraying Williams' small circle also lend great support, but Rhys Ifan steals the show as the outlandish Spike.  Those who liked Four Weddings will definitely go for Notting Hill, which has a tad more sweetness, like apricot and honey.",1062806400,82,3441,4.722408026755853
64624,4,0783241569,"I am not a Julia Roberts fan.  I don't think she is a great actress, and I don't find her particularly attractive.  I usually don't like her movies because I don't think she is effective.  ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" would have been much better without Julia as the lead actress.
However, she is great here, even if it is Hugh Grant who makes the movie go.  This movie is smart, romantic, and quite touching.  Grant is the owner of a small travel bookstore who meets Roberts (playing a movie icon) when she comes in to shop.  Throughout the movie, they hook up, and split up a couple of times, mostly on Julia's whims.
What makes the movie, is the characters.  Roberts is not as shallow and transparent as usual.  Grant is funny, especially since the movie is shot in his native England.  The various British accents make the movie lots of fun to see.  Rhys Ifans as the slovenly roommate of Grant is a hoot and steals each scene he's in.  I also loved Grant's sister, and the birthday party scene where Grant shows up with Roberts is a classic.
The plot is no surprise, but the characters and the dialogue make this a great movie to watch.  If you are a fan of Julia's, you must see this.  If not, the other characters in the film should help, especially since they are relative unknowns and I found that to be refreshing.",1062028800,,1346,4.4227642276422765
64625,5,0783241569,"Notting Hill is a stunning romantic comedy that you can watch many times over.  Julia Roberts is perfect as Anna Scott, the charming, gorgeous celebrity who encounters Hugh Grant's character, William Thacker.  Comic relief is provided by both charismatic actors, as well as William's roommate, Spike.  The story flows smoothly without being bogged down in unecessary scenes, such as flashbacks or the like. The plot is solid and filled with warmth, heart and extreme wit that is well built upon by the wonderful cast.
The DVD version is wonderful for any fan with several funny deleted scenes, insightful commentaries and an even a map of the charming English area of Notting Hill.",1050883200,,681,5.0625
64626,3,0783241569,"For screenwriter Richard Curtis' follow-up to the unexpected success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, he had to capitalise by importing big name star Julia Roberts.  Whilst he does this, the result is nowhere near as personable as the excellent Four Weddings or the later Bridget Jones' Diary, despite it being probably the best romantic comedy of 1999.  The story has poor bookshop owner William Thacker (Grant) meeting famous actress Anna Scott (Roberts) by accident and them forming a relationship that has to overcome the problem of Anna's celebrity.  Of course, the answer is obvious from the very beginning, although there are enough flourishes and nice touches to make this much well worth seeing for any movie-goer, no matter how cynical.
In particular, the supporting cast is a charm (mainly consisting of well-known British TV actors), in particular the wonderful Emma Chambers as William's sister.  Carrying over her performance as Alice in British comedy The Vicar of Dibley, she steals just about every scene she's in.  Of course, it would be impossible to overlook the main performers and Grant is amiable enough doing his typical role as the English fop.  Of course, the real interesting point of note there is that this was the role that rescued him from his ugly public persona at the time.  As for Julia Roberts, she has appropriately enough never looked more beautiful, and puts in a charismatic performance (despite it not being quite as memorable as her tour de force in Erin Brockavich) that in particular shines at the end when she presents William with the choice to be with her or not.  Managing to portray vulnerability she is every bit the luminous actress that the role demands of her.
There isn't really much to fault the film for, just the fact that it isn't particularly anything special.  Indeed, it's telling that things are a lot more interesting when we're not focused on the leads' romance.  Especially, what was probably meant as a study of the nature and absurdities of celebrity doesn't really come together.  This has nothing to do with the acting but more the fact that it's difficult to take seriously something that presents itself openly as a fairytale romance.  Or maybe this was the point, but if it's that love can conquer all then it's hardly unconventional.  Still, the vein of wonderful British humour (along with Emma Chambers and Rys Ifans) make this enjoyable and sweet without ever succumbing to sentimentality.  Sure it's no classic but you'll be hard pushed to find something more sweet-natured.",1038268800,5,2550,4.9834905660377355
64627,4,0783241569,"Richard Curtis (writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral, and co-writer of The Vicar of Dibley, Mr. Bean, The Black Adder, and Bridget Jones's Diary) is, at least in my books, a fairly safe bet when it comes to comedy.  Like Four Weddings and a Funeral, this film is a light (albeit fanciful) romantic British comedy which proceeds at a gentle pace, with the humour being characteristically understated and seasoned with some very funny moments.  As with so many British comedies, the humour is primarily dialogue-based with very little reliance on slapstick or silly gags.
The film stars Hugh Grant (an actor whom, I will confess right now, I enjoy) as William Thacker, the rather reserved owner of a travel book shop in the Notting Hill district of London.  Thacker meets Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a high-profile Hollywood actress, when she wanders into his book shop.  Things more or less progress from there, with the tensions arising from the stressors one would naturally expect to surface in any relationship involving a famous individual.
The supporting actors are absolutely wonderful in this film, with my favourite being James Dreyfus (The Thin Blue Line's side-splittingly funny Constable Goody), who is the real show stealer as Thacker's hilarious shop assistant, Martin.  Dreyfus's role is a small one (and I'd have loved to have seen more use made of him), but he is certainly pivotal in providing the film with some of its funniest moments.  Then there is Emma Chambers's portrayal of Thacker's ditsy, hare-brained sister, Honey (a character very similar to Chambers's role as the air-headed Alice Tinker in The Vicar of Dibley).  Of course, one must not forget Thacker's Welsh flatmate, Spike, a slovenly, tactless, not to mention witless idiot.
The Special Edition of the video contains (after the closing credits) roughly seven clips that were edited out of the film, which I really enjoyed seeing.  Following this is a five-minute behind-the-scenes tour with Hugh Grant, during which the viewer is introduced to Grant's parents (which was kind of nice).
In short, though I'm not a person who is normally attracted to the romantic comedy genre in general, I am a huge fan of British comedy, and I really quite enjoyed this film.  But then Richard Curtis has a distinctive brand of humour which (at least in my opinion) is always highly enjoyable.  Those who've enjoyed his other offerings (particularly Four Weddings and a Funeral, which bears the closest similarity to this one) will surely enjoy this film.  Even if you're not familiar with Curtis (or with British comedies in general), I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys and is looking for a really sweet, light romantic comedy.  (Oh, and if you enjoyed this film, please check out The Vicar of Dibley--you'll not be disappointed.  It's not a romantic comedy, but it contains the same type of humour and it is hands down one of the funniest shows around!)",1035244800,2,2956,4.983739837398374
64628,4,0783241569,"A fairly run of the mill, brit flik romantic comedy, the casting of Rhys Ifans though brings a level of comedy which elevates the movies as a whole.
Hugh Grant playing his usual stuttering awkward englishman to a tee, and he does it so well.
The most annoying element is the friends over the topness, much as in Bridget Jones diary, the actors involved seem to be overdoing it and it all a bit sickening.
And if only that bloody annoying Ronan Keating song wasn't peppered throughout, it causes a wave of nausea on its opening strains.
as romantic comedys go, its a pretty good one",1031270400,2,581,4.490566037735849
64629,2,0783241569,"None of this rings true, a sentiment apparently endorsed by Roberts who did not believe in a lot of her character's actions, especially over the old photographs. This may explain the lack of chemistry between the two stars and Robert's curiously stiff and un-attractive performance. I didn't believe in the press scrum outside Grant's front door, either. For a start, the police wouldn't accept an obstruction in a narrow street like that, but I won't carp on. There's the odd laugh.",1031184000,5,483,4.9753086419753085
64630,5,0783241569,"Notting Hill - You either love it or you hate it, and since you don't spend this much money on a DVD without knowing whether or not you like the film this review is purely about the extras on the DVD, ultimate edition.  When I was trying to choose between the Collectors Edition and the Ultimate Edition I couldn't find any helpful reviews so here is the first Amazon review I have ever written.
Disc 1 -
Widescreen version of the film.  Choice of English or French language, English captions and Spanish subtitles.  Since I can't read Spanish I don't know what the difference between captions and subtitles is.
Feature commentary (subtitles available) - The Writer, Director and Producer talk over the whole film, providing a wonderful glimpse behind the scenes.  Non-stop anecdotes about filming, props, sets, stars and supporting cast.  The history of the blue door and the fate of garden benches.  Why the entire production crew had to dress up in jackets and ties. Which of those locations were in fact sets on a sound studio and loads of other stuff that makes you view the film with a fresh eye.  If you are still in love with Anna Scott and Wil Thacker, don't watch this as it does, to some extent, take away the magic of the story.
Spotlight on location (subtitles available) - 14:00 minutes - Scenes from the film with chat from the writer, director, producer, Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville.
Seasonal walk down Portobello Road - 3:30 minutes - Disappointingly short but very interesting.  The Special Effects Supervisor explains just how they filmed Hugh's one minute walk through six months of London's weather changes.
Deleted Scenes - 6 scenes cut from the finished film.  Many others are mentioned during the feature commentary but these are entertaining enough although personally I am glad they didn't make it to the final version.  William tries to tell his parents, another blind date at the dinner table, Spike serves Anna pepperoni pizza, Spike messing things up even more after Anna leaves, Spike giving wedding day interviews to the media and an alternative ending set in Tony's prospering restaurant.
Music Highlights - Direct jumps to nine songs from the movie
Recommendations - Just a trailer for Erin Brockovich
Travel Book - About three pages of text from a (very poor) travel guide to Notting Hill with a map and list of restaurants.  I felt very cheated as I was expecting a live tour of the real Notting Hill; hoping for something like a thirty minute documentary you might see on the travel channel.
Production Notes - About a dozen pages of text, much of which is mentioned in the commentary.
Cast and Film Makers - Brief Bios of the main actors, the writer, producer and director.
DVD Newsletter - Web address to register for on-line newsletter.  It didn't inspire me to register so I can't tell you anything about it.
DVD-ROM - If you have the hardware on your computer there 'might' be access to wallpapers, screen savers and internet sites.  It doesn't say exactly what and since I don't have a DVD-ROM I can't tell you anything else.
Disc 2
Full screen version of the film - Language and subtitles the same as disc 1

Hugh Grant's Movie Tips - 4:00 minutes - Disappointingly short.  Meet his parents and some of the crew.
Elvis Costello video - Elvis Costello singing his version of 'She'.  This video gave me a headache.  There are only four verses but I lost count at 50 camera jumps from Elvis in the theatre, Elvis sitting down and Elvis standing outside.  Some clips from the film included
Shania Twain video - Cute video of Shania singing 'You've got a way' with some clips from the film.  Nicely done.
Photograph Montage - 4:45 minutes - This I thought was going to be another space filler but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Stills from the film and a few behind the scenes shots set to the Anna and Wil music score by Trevor Jones.  I found it amazing how much more I saw in a still that I missed in the film.  Very well chosen pictures and beautiful music.
US Theatrical Trailer - 2:45 minutes - As seen in American Theatres
International Theatrical Trailer - 2:10 minutes - As seen in English Theatres - These two trailers are totally different and really bring home the cultural differences between England and America.  I was surprised to see clips from a deleted scene here.
There it is.  If you got this far, thanks for reading.  By the way, I loved the film.  Like Four Weddings and a Funeral it is just so English.  Being English myself, from London, with a crush on Hugh Grant, I am of course extremely biased.",1029369600,25,4825,4.607476635514018
64631,5,0783241569,"This is one of the relatively few ""romantic comedies"" that lives up to both ends of the deal.  Usually you get far more of one than the other.  This movie strikes an excellent balance.  I saw Notting Hill in the theater twice, which is highly unusual for me.  The first time was with a girlfriend and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  So much so that I dragged my husband along the second time.  He even had to admit that he really liked it.  Hugh Grant is so charming in this movie.  And Julia Roberts is very believable and likeable in this flick.  It's a twisted modern day fairy tale of sorts and it is extremely well done.  Every bit of the cast is fantastic although Hugh and his roommate steal the show in terms of comedy.  The soundtrack is immensely fitting and also worth the purchase.  If you liked anything that either Julia or Hugh have done, you will love this one!",1027036800,,877,4.345679012345679
64632,5,0783241569,"As a huge Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts fan, you can see why this is my all time favorite movie.  Hugh Grant is funny without trying to be.  He has such a natural wit about him.  This movie has it all, humor, charm, and melt-your-heart moments that we all secretly hope for in our own lives.  Not to mention a terrific soundtrack featuring the song ""She"" by Elvis Costello.
A famous movie star Anna Scott(Julia Roberts)finds herself in a bookstore in Notting Hill London owned by William Thacher(Hugh Grant).  A few moments after she leaves he once again bumps into her and thus begins the story.  To him, she is a fantasy and to her, he is a normalcy she has never had.
And the supporting cast........HILARIOUS!!!!  Only one word to say here....SPIKE!!!!  He alone keeps your side in stitches.  And what about little sister Honey???  Another outrageously  funny character.
This is a wonderful movie and if you haven't seen it you are truly missing out.",1026950400,2,952,4.674698795180723
64633,3,0783241569,This is a great comedy vehicle for Hugh Grant -- sardonic wit etc. Julia Roberts is acceptable because the role (essentially she plays herself) is not too taxing on her very limited acting ability. The supporting cast is quite funny -- especially the flat-mate. The finale with Elvis Costello attempting to sing like a grizzled Charles Aznavor is hilariously kitschy. Overall a surprisingly entertaining movie in spite of Julia Roberts.,1020902400,2,436,5.242857142857143
64634,5,0783241569,"In an act of good faith, ""Notting Hill"" begins with the awesome Elvis Costello singing the song ""She"".  This would imply that the movie is all about how Hugh (and you) is going to fall in love with Julia Roberts.  Not so fast.  Julia is hardly the perfect object of desire here that she is in her earlier films.  She's shallow, and flighty, and has a shotgun temper (okay, okay, she's still got that great smile, but bear with me here for a moment).  So this movie breaks one of my first rules of romantic comedies: I *must* fall in love with the girl.  But like another of my all-time favourites, ""Say Anything..."", it expertly portrays how the boy in question falls for said girl (even if I can't), and makes me believe that it is not only possible for him to do so, but unstoppable despite the odds against him.
So what's wrong with Julia here?  Well, let's face it: she just doesn't turn in a very good performance.  She seems to be trying to prove her character right when she says, ""I told you I couldn't act!""  She has not the low-key wit or stuffy self-deprecating sense of humour to pull of the decidedly British script.  But the irony is that no one else on the planet could have played this role, or at least played it as convincingly.  Her character, Anna Scott, is the Julia Roberts of the ""Notting Hill"" parallel universe: a commercially hyper-successful actress who longs not only for respectability, but also trucks full of attention.  Anna only comes out of her shell when William pronounces her ""heavenly"", a trick I've seen Ms. Roberts fall for in dozens of interviews.
Now, I admit that Julia does deserve all the credit in the world for at least being willing to poke fun at her persona.  A telling scene around a dinner table involves a sorriest sap contest for the last brownie.  Anna tells of her ten years of dieting and her plastic surgeries, all in an attempt to postpone the ""day, not long from now when [her] looks will go, they'll find out [she] can't act and [she'll] become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.""  To the script's credit, her dinner companions don't fall for this sad tale (one tempered, minutes before, by her own admission that her last film paid her $15 million), but for at least one moment, Julia's own off-screen fears (or at least as I imagine them to be) are laid flat on the table.
The film works for me, mainly, because Hugh Grant plays the 'boy' role.  Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis have worked together three times by now (""Four Wedding and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" being their other collaborations), and every time the outcome has been pure gold.  Grant is an expert at portraying this kind of character: witty and plain, genuine and straightforward, stumbling but elegant.  In the early scenes with Julia, where his William Thacker appears to want to jump over the counter and maul the famous celebrity who's just stepped into his little travel book shop but can't because of his British reserve, he is charming and vulnerable all at once.  And I think Hugh is the only actor working today who could respond to a question like, ""Can I stay a bit longer?"" with ""Stay forever,"" and not make it sound false or melodramatic.  Coming from his mouth, it sounds heartbreaking and real.
As for Curtis, he's managed a deft and funny script that puts a new spin on the boy-meet-girl/boy-loses-girl/(spoiler omitted) genre, while throwing in some slick Hollywood satire to help it all go down easier (he's fashioned a hilarious junket sequence ('Horse & Hound') that trumps anything a later Roberts film, the bland ""America's Sweethearts"", came up with).  He captures true sentiment, even through such an unbelievable and fantastic situation as this one.  And just like I wouldn't mind seeing Hugh Grant in this kind of role over and over again (with slight variations), if Richard Curtis would spend the rest of his days writing witty screenplays wherein Yanks fall in love with Brits who are egged on by a group of eccentric friends, I'd be terribly happy.  Curtis himself has noted the obvious resemblance between ""Notting Hill"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""; let's hope he forgets the repetition next time he sits down at the keyboard.
Similarities aside, the background of ""Notting Hill"" is populated with a number of interesting and noteworthy performances.  Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee play William's best friends; he's the world's worst cook, she's consigned to a wheelchair.  Their love is palpable and endearing.  Hugh Bonneville plays a sad-sack stockbroker friend.  Emma Chambers is William's nervous sister.  And of course, the wonderful Rhys Ifans nearly steals the show as Spike.  Sure he gets to spend a lot of time wandering around in his underpants (not to mention a memorable little moment in a scuba suit), but Ifans never goes over the top to mine laughs from the character.  Far from it.  He's low-key, almost droll in his portrayal of the man who Will casually describes as little more than a ""masturbating Welshman"".
Where it was an act of good faith in the beginning, meant to endear itself to the audience when they didn't know what was coming, the use of Elvis Costello again singing ""She"" near the end perfectly sums up the movie: ""Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears / And make them all my souvenirs / For where she goes I've got to be / The meaning of my life is she"".  It's a sappy sentiment, but following a movie that revels in its own status as such high-grade sap, it's also a perfect sentiment.",1020729600,8,5556,4.684156378600823
64635,4,0783241569,"Not being a Hugh Grant fan and not being a Julia Roberts fanatic I didn't even bother to see this movie when it was released in the theaters.  But I was glad that I rented it.  It was a pleasant romantic-(semi)-comedy movie.  I found myself feeling so sorry for Hugh's character and Julia's had me up and down, in and out, liking her and disliking her.  Both did a fine job but this poor man was a glutton for punishment.  It's like that when you are in love, hopelessly.  You keep going back for more and more rejection, followed by hope (can you tell it didn't work for me?).  Anyway - after I saw the movie I was enchanted with it.  A very good movie and a nice suprise.",1020643200,,673,4.162790697674419
64636,4,0783241569,"Notting Hill is one of my favorite romantic comedies, right up there with Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seatle.  I've read that some people call this film ""preposterous"" or ""completely unbelievable"".  In fact, I thought this movie very believable, centered around one realistic, if highly improbable, ""what if?""  What if an ordinary fan courted and married a movie super-star?
Hugh Grant plays an ordinary guy who has a chance meeting with international film star Julia Roberts (there was some other name for Roberts' character, but for all purposes, she is playing herself).  A simple hello and a spilt cup of OJ kick-starts Grants romance with this very mysterious person, sweeping him into the crazy movie-star-life of press junkets and gossip reporters.  The perfect film-image of Roberts is shattered with the reality that she is a very closed, cautious person with a sharp tongue.  And yet, as all perfect romance movies do, the hard shell is gradually peeled back to reveal a very loving person inside.
I found the earthly Grant too be much more charming and interesting than the cold, distant Roberts, and I could associate with his character as he loved a person on a movie screen soo much that his heart broken.  This film is a great ""date movie"", as it gives a lot to women without turning of men (there are some great jokes in there, just for the guys).",1019001600,4,1368,4.82051282051282
64637,4,0783241569,"Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant each appeared in two movies in the summer of 1998. Roberts starred in the smash hit, Runaway Bride, while Grant had top billing in the unsuccessful Mikey Blue Eyes. All this proves is that she can carry a picture, and he can't. Business and star politics aside, Notting Hill is easily the best summer movie they were in.
The plot is as preposterous as they come, but this is permitted in romantic comedy. Grant plays William Thacker, who runs a little travel bookstore on Portobello Road in London's Notting Hill district. Roberts is Anna Scott, the biggest female movie star on the planet. This is amusing in itself, since Roberts is exactly that in real life. On location in England, Scott wanders into William's shop one afternoon. He doesn't even recognize her until a customer does. Later, he runs into in the street, where he spills orange juice all over the both of them. Accepting an invitation to clean herself up, she goes to his flat. Emotions begin to smolder. What unfolds is by the book boy meets girl, boy loses girl, etc., but it's all done in witty, bright and sophisticated fashion.
Notting Hill utilizes two of the oldest Hollywood romantic devices - the two main characters have failed at love, and they come from social scenes that are polar opposites. Its writer and director are shrewd enough to know that these are tensions which can add the comedy to romance. She flounders in his world, and we laugh. He stumbles in hers, and we laugh still more. Even in the inevitable scene where their world collide, and the romance seems doomed, we find amusement.
This is the best and most successful British comedy [excluding their trademark period pieces] since Four Weddings and a Funeral, which also had but one major American character. We get a parade of those eccentric English characters we adore. By far the funniest is Spike [Rhys Ifans], who is William's ditzy, clueless flat mate. Most of his best scenes cannot be written down for a family publication, but I can say that they are bawdy, as opposed to tawdry. Spike does not know how to dress, how to carry on a conversation longer than two sentences or how to react normally to life's simplest situations. He may be the one character who is most likely to also exist in the real world. Ifans is almost assured of receiving a Best Supporting Actor nomination next spring.
Roberts and Grant are in top form. She doesn't grin her way out of every emotional moment, and he keeps his trademark stutter in check. It's hard to say how much real chemistry there is between them, but it hardly matters, because they are two of the most charming and affable actors on the screen today. Their performance are right up their with what I consider to be their best - she in My Best Friend's Wedding, he in Sense and Sensibility.
The photography is excellent. One scene, in which William walks along Portobello Road as the seasons change, is remarkable. It's one of those complex-to-do creations that comes off as seamless and simple. Also of note is a moment where Spike, in his underwear, unwittingly opens the flat door and walks into a sea of screaming, photo-snapping journalists. It is a classic comedic moment.
I don't think it matters all that much that the plot is a tried and true one. After all, the point isn't whether or not you paint a landscape, but how well you paint it. If Notting Hill were a painting, it wouldn't be a masterpiece, but it would be very pleasing to the eye nonetheless.",1016668800,32,3496,4.667747163695299
64638,3,0783241569,"This is a great Saturday afternoon movie, but the ending was so badly ripped off the 1953 film Roman Holiday.  Despite this amazingly obvious stunt, Julia Roberts shines once again, with Grant dithering around her. While Notting Hill is much funnier than Roman Holiday, Roman Holiday is a much more moving and romantic story (I think);  I almost cried and for a 32 year old bloke who normally enjoys action and sci-fi, that's saying something.",1015372800,,443,4.8933333333333335
64639,5,0783241569,"I am not a big fan of romantic comedies in general, but ""Notting Hill"" is one of my favorite movies. ""Notting Hill"" is a love story between travel book store owner, William Thacker played by Hugh Grant, and world famous actress, Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts. There is a special chemistry between Grant and Roberts that I seldom see in modern films. There's a perfect blend of romance and comedy. Rhys Ifans, who plays Thacker's flatmate Spike, adds to the comedy. The soundtrack is also wonderful, and includes the beautiful song, ""She"". This movie might have been billed as a ""chick-flick"" but both my wife and I enjoyed it immensely. ""Notting Hill"" is highly recommended.",1013990400,5,679,4.862068965517241

64641,5,0783241569,"While Notting Hill may be a bit of a trifle as motion pictures go, it's an amusing and entertaining way to while away an afternoon.  Julia Roberts radiates her characteristic charm as Anna Scott, and Hugh Grant puts a high polish on his trademark bumbling as William, the humble London bookstore owner.  The film offers a glimpse into one of London's most charming districts, an is a witty self-referencing look at Ms. Roberts herself.
The Ultimate Edition DVD is amazing, with music videos and featurettes about the film.  I particulary enjoyed the behind-the -scenes look at how they shot William's walk down Portobello Rd. during the changing seasons.  The packaging is very attractive, particulary the fact that you can open it up to reveal the wall with Julia's face on it without the overlay of Hugh Grant and the title of the film, which is something I've wanted to do since I first saw this poster.
All in all, a charming flick by a charming actress.",1010361600,5,958,4.753012048192771

The cast is so very balanced and no one is underdevloped showing how normal hardships are equal to the mega hardships of the central characters. The seasonal montage is very clever and unique i think, and the clash of lives is very well provided for. The friends are so genuine you  feel instantly welcome in their lives and homes. So many clever scenes that the movie never lags and is wonderful to see again and again.
The ending with the press conference is just about as perfect as it can me..breathlessly timed and even after seeing it many times i still feel i don't know how it will come out..can you say that for many movies?

A quite cute bit is the ""Hugh Grant's Film Tips.""  This is just a light look at his recommendations such as not allowing your parents to your film set.
All this being said, this is a good movie.  I didn't like it much the first time I saw it- Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) just came across as very selfish and uncaring, which she is.

64645,4,0783241569,"Notting Hill is a pleasant movie that presents some interesting moments making it a soft movie.
In spite of being a romantic story, the movie presents some comedy parts, mainly offered by Spike, starred by Rhys Ifans.
The contradictions of the romance follow the same path, a couple with different kinds of life and job, different economic levels, but with non-defined futures that could come along.
The love begins when Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) an American movie star visits a travel bookstore in England and is attended
by William Thacker (Hugh Grant), the owner.
From this moment on the meeting becomes frequent, but with problems caused by Anna's professional liabilities and by journalists that want news about her relationships.
Some small parts could be improved, like a moment when Anna, who is wearing only a borrowed shirt from William, answers William's front door and is photographed by journalists. This would never happen in real life, a famous actress wouldn't be that naive.
The story isn't great, there aren't beautiful set photos and the production is rather normal to a Julia Roberts' movie.

The bias against comedies at Oscar (insert registered trademark here!) time blatantly sends the message that comedies are not to be regarded as ""great films"".  Too bad, because as any great actor will tell you, comedy is a lot harder to play than tragedy.  And ""Notting Hill"" is a perfect example of a cast of actors playing the truth in comedy.
This is a film where you care about each chracter (the mark of a great film). Julia Roberts does splendidly as ""Anna Scott"", showing the human side of fame as the world's biggest star.  Hugh Grant is great as ""William Thacker"", the British bookstore owner who Anna falls for (and he for her, in a wonderfully Bristish sort-of way).

Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, the owner of a travel bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, world-famous actress. Their improbable meeting when he bumped into her on Portobello Road and spilled orange juice all over her shirt is just the first of the amusing, though contrived antics that are sprinkled throughout the movie.
The character actors are nothing short of hysterical. William's incredibly offensive, but harmless roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans) is the most memorable. But there are others, including William's sister and hapless friends, and the brief cameo role of Anna's American boyfriend played by Alec Baldwin.

The actors portraying Grant's screen family are amusing, particularly during the obligatory ""meet my colorful and wacky relatives"" dinner scene.

64661,5,0783241569,"This is a lovely fairy tale, and best of all, one that could (maybe!) just possibly come true! The story itself is nothing very new. Rich sophisticated lost girl meets poor but innocent boy, is charmed by his simplicity and difference from the rest of the wolves, some misunderstandings and then all is resolved. The charm of the movie lies in the stars and in innumerable little touches. Julia Roberts as Anna Scott is breathtaking. She can be a regal star one moment and a regular girl the next as she trespasses into a private garden or studies her lines on the terrace. She actually manages to make you feel sorry for her way of life; suddenly you begin to think that the glamour may not really compensate for the endless glare of publicity and the everlasting pressure to be beautiful. One line of hers always grabs me, when she tells Grant ""..I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.."". For my money, Julia holds the movie together but then, I am a fan of hers. I must say that all my female friends melted into a puddle over Hugh Grant's little lost boy mannerisms. The said mannerisms actually annoy me, but the understated British humor is neat and subtle. The supporting characters depicted are also everyday people with their quirks and twists and they give the movie a strong foundation. As for Spike, the incorrigible flatmate, he is simply mind blowing (would you believe he is actually a professor in real life?). All in all, a move that you can see more than once, preferably with a special someone. At the end, an uneasy question arises: so far so good but would this really last?

Set in a picturesque British village, and featuring a supporting cast of  characters you will want to be your friends, Notting Hill feeds your  fantasies from its first moments.  Hugh Grant, of the fluttering eyelids  and stammering, nervous chatter, is a perfect foil for Julia's star.  Lovely attention to detail, as in a wondrous sequence marking the change of  seasons on the village's streets, add a colorful resonance to this movie,  which is also underscored by a well-chosen series of pop songs.

It takes forever to go anywhere and once it ""arrives"" it's leaves you saying, SO WHAT.  The ONLY  bright bit of acting in this movie was Hugh Grant ~ great in his stammering  and perfectly-timed line deliveries and wonderful in the role of the well  meaning, cheerful and simple fellow who falls for the unattainable lass,  Ms. Roberts.  Julia could have done much more with this role, but her  performance left me wondering why she chose to play it like an actress  asleep in front of the camera lens.
Supporting roles were good, i.e.,  Grant's kooky sister and his roommie, Spike.  The soundtrack is nice, and  fits the mood of the story, but if you're looking for a Julia Roberts love  story to end all love stories, I'd pass this one up and rent Pretty Woman  instead.

Given that, I was really disappointed by this film. First, having Julia  Roberts essentially play herself while Hugh Grant plays a  ""nobody"" was weird; that scene at the end where they're supposed  to be at one of her movie premieres just looks like they'd shown up for the  gala opening of this movie! The pace of the film is deadly slow and,  contrary to other reviews I've seen, I just don't see any chemistry  whatsoever between Hugh and Julia. They looked like they'd be more  comfortable discussing the size of their cut of the movie's gross than  playing love scenes. Compare their scenes with those of Hugh and Andie  Macdowell in Four Weddings and you'll see what I mean. The supporting cast  of fine actors is reduced to stupid, self-pitying cameo scenes, except for  Rhys Infans. Just not much of a movie, romantic or otherwise. Only gets two  stars from me for the all-around level of competence of most of the cast.",949276800,2,1074,4.624338624338624

Hugh Grant plays the  perfect low-self-esteemed Englishman who doesn't look for love with a  moviestar yet is unable to detatch himself from her once he's there.

My girlfriend thought that Hugh's flatmate was funny.  I found him  to be ignorant and boorish in the extreme.
