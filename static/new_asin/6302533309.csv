7827996,5,6302533309,"I trained with Sifu Lyons for 5 years at his dojo in Lake Arrowhead, California, and he also had a Dojo in Big Bear, California. So any talk of Sifu Lyons being an amatuer is absurd. This guy is the real deal. He trained Tiger, Crane, Monkey, and Snake. He is also a Master of Shaolin Choung Hop Kuen kung-fu, and also extremly versed in the style of Muay Thai. So any of you afraid to purchase the video because of the one-star reviews because he not a real Sifu is 100% false.",1165795200,,478,4.150537634408602
7827997,5,6302533309,"I've been training in the martial arts since 1976.  While I can not attest to Mr. Lyons credentials, the video is of high quality for those who are looking for instruction in a basic form of Tiger Kung Fu.  This is not a kung fu movie for entertainment value, it gives step by step instruction and the instruction is first rate, if you train with the video diligently you will get a fine workout and learn quite a bit about self defense with a traditional Chinese tiger form.  Even though it is a basic form, there is a lot of ""meat"" to it.  I don't purchase many training videos but I was very pleased with this one, many of it's principles have become a permanent part of my training regimen.",1153094400,,694,4.315384615384615
7827998,1,6302533309,"Lyons doesn't look like any Sifu I've ever seen. His movements are weak, and his horse stance is just a slight bend of the knee. He looks like a beginner, who filmed an instructional video in his garage.
When I bought this video, I thought I'd be getting the tiger form I've seen before. Very low stances, with dynamic hand forms. It's called ""Tiger"" kung fu for a reason.
I don't know what Lyons is doing, but it's definitely not a powerful Tiger form. I wouldn't even recommend this to a beginner, because Lyons just juggles the same 6 or 7 moves. I've seen children do better forms than this. Awful.",1077494400,4,602,4.4324324324324325
7827999,4,6302533309,This Video was very fun to learn. I was able to learn the complete form in just 2 weeks!(results may vary) Now I practice the form every day and makes me feel more powerful with the figthing spirit of the tiger! This is a very powerful form if used correctly.,994982400,5,259,4.2
