8619459,5,B00FYJ6MR2,"I have  to disagree with the review that said this is a horrible movie pairing because Movie 43 is for adults and The Three Stooges is more family oriented.  One, The Three Stooges is rated PG - no, that doesn't cut it out of the family movie realm, but it's not for small children either.  Two, I think this is a 'parent pack' - one movie for the family, one movie for the parents.  Nothing wrong with the parents having time alone watching a movie!",1412899200,,450,4.258823529411765
8619460,1,B00FYJ6MR2,"I have seen both of these movies. Movie 43 is an ADULT comedy, while The Three Stooges movie is more or less a FAMILY comedy. These moves were NOT meant for the same audience. If you plan to buy, please keep these facts in mind.",1398470400,,228,4.088888888888889
