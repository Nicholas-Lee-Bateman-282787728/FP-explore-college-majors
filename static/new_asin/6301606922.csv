8653356,5,6301606922,"Unfortunately, if you love the music and the original videos for songs like ""Children Say"", you'll have to buy the VHS, as it was never released on DVD, and it has been removed from sites like YouTube. However, if it's in immaculate condition like the one I bought, you can transfer it pretty quickly on a DVD recorder, (for strictly your own use), and the tape should still last a number of years. What a great band, and if you're a big fan of Level 42 or a musician songwriter like I am, the small price is easily worth it ... many times over. Love it!",1281916800,,554,4.235849056603773
