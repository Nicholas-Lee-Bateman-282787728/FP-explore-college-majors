8303237,3,B001G0E798,"John Boles is as talented and handsome as ever.  This is a serious movie, but it has a great story line that captures a father and son learning the importance of love and working on keeping their relationship intact.",1354060800,2,216,4.538461538461538
8303238,5,B001G0E798,This is great classic movie from the 1940s. It's about a Singer who got divorced and is now trying to find a job and support him and his son at the same time. He takes a job he really doesn't want so he can support his young son. The no hearted mother only cares about herself and is only interested in living the rich life with her new millionaire husband. It's an interesting broken relationship film you will love.,1222041600,5,417,4.291139240506329
