In the 2nd Ward, you follow the hot red sister on the cover of the movie through her early days in Utah where she is a student of BYU. Living in the glenwood, she meets Dallen, the dude on the cover, and they quickly fall in love. As most people can agree, marriages are great but there is always one or two 'hickups' along the way. These two lover birds are no exception. Great movie. My wife and I loved it. P.S. we too met and fell in love at the Glenwood.",1354752000,,544,4.046296296296297

I love this movie and I think it's a great sequel to the first one.  I think it's cute, funny, and engaging.  I don't want to give the plot away, so I'll just say that the movie does a good job of dealing with a couple major issues that sometimes arise between Mormons and non-Mormons.

Almost every shot in this movie is way too close to the actors. You will feel like you want to back away from the screen the entire duration. The shots being so close, also makes it difficult and even painful to get any grounding. You will find yourself feeling like a floating orb with no spatial awareness, rather than a bystander, or a silent witness. The plot seemed interesting at first, but almost nothing happens throughout the movie. I would say watch it if you are a collector of LDS movies, but if you are looking for something similar to the original, try The RM instead, which also stars Kirby, and is obviously inspired by Better Off Dead.",1481328000,,778,4.372413793103449
