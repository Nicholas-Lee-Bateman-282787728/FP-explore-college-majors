8141582,4,B000HWXRLK,"D. O. A. & The Bigamist

These two movies feature Edmond OBrien, an actor who had varying roles and looked like an ordinary person. D. O. A. is the more dramatic, the story of a man killed by a slow acting poison. Both are set in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. See the individual reviews for more information. Note the condition of the city streets.

D. O. A. (1949) tells about an accountant in a small town. Frank visits San Francisco on business, and later a bar to hear live jazz musicians. The next day he visits the Medical Center and is given unbelievable news! Frank goes to Los Angeles to see Mr. Phillips but he has just died. Somebody shoots at him, he fires back! Then Frank is kidnapped but escapes! [One valuable lesson is to guard your food and drink in public.]

The Bigamist (1953) is probably based on a true crime. Harry owns a small business in San Francisco but spends a lot of time in Los Angeles. His wife in Frisco wants to adopt a child. The investigation reveals Harrys second wife Phyllis in Los Angeles who has a baby! This is played as a drama although it could have been a comedy (The Captains Paradise).",1446854400,,1139,4.388625592417061
