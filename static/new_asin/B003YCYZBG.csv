4228444,5,B003YCYZBG,"This series you will see tons of footage you have never seen it is done in a great fashion. The Narration was perfect that being said a few key battles were left out. Like Normanday actual invasion, a few major battles on the eastern front perhaps it was too much old footage I don't know but it transiscions well and I will give it 5 stars must have",1309910400,3,350,4.161764705882353
4228445,5,B003YCYZBG,"With a lot of ""unseen"" and graphic footage, I highly recommend this dvd set to any WWII or history buff. The only downfall that I have (other than it's being not long enough), is the last part that covers 1945. As many events that occured in the final months leading up to VE and VJ days, it seems like they tried to squeeze as much into 50 minutes as they could (example: Okinawa barely gets mentioned). Otherwise, I give it five stars just from the perspective of the war that they present.",1309824000,2,492,4.358695652173913
4228446,5,B003YCYZBG,It is incredible to see these films and to hear the story narrated in such a way it makes you feel for everyone who went through this.  Truly a must have for any historical buff and those who are interested went went on during WWII.,1304380800,3,232,4.155555555555556
4228447,5,B003YCYZBG,"I have at least twenty historical dvds of WWII, and Countless Hollywood movies about WWII.  What I believe makes This series and Blu-ray unique is seeing more of a perspective of the civilians during WWII.  Many of the historical dvds give the viewer details of the battles, and film and pictures of the battles, but more from a soldiers perspective.  I am glad to add this to my collection because I believe it added that civilian perspective.  Many people forget that the civilian causaulty rate dwarfed that of the soldiers lost during WWII.  The civilians were just as courageous as the soldiers in many instances.  Hopefully we will never have to repeat the lessons that so many learned.",1303257600,60,692,4.822033898305085
4228448,5,B003YCYZBG,"I was blown away by this series, it has very raw footage, its not for the faint of heart, NOT made for TV. Has an outstanding soundtrack. Get it ,you won't be disappointed.",1301616000,2,172,4.242424242424242
4228449,3,B003YCYZBG,"I have what is apparently the original version of this series which I ordered through Time-Life. It is in English with a rather bland narrator whose voice I don't recognize. While not obviously inaccurate the narration doesn't go into a lot of detail and repeats many well-worn cliches (i.e. Polish cavalry DID NOT deliberately charge German tanks in September 1939; they simply got surprised in the open by a German armored column). Disc 2, which details the first 6 months of the Pacific War, contains very little new info and I quickly became bored watching it.

Time-Life promotes this series as being spectacular and new. A lot of the footage is indeed new, but I also had seen much of it before on history websites. There are also some curious parts in which the script feels like it was solely written to incorporate available footage.

That said, there is some very interesting footage that I had never seen before. Colorized footage of U.S. battleships burning at Pearl Harbor and Japanese planes apparently ditching in the ocean after their carriers had been sunk at the Battle of Midway was nice. Footage showing executions of Jews and alleged collaborators can also be quite graphic, as can be the scenes of dead bodies.

I would recommend buying this series only for the footage, much of which is definitely worth the price of admission. But if you've been studying World War 2 in detail for any length of time don't expect to learn anything particularly new. If you're new to this subject, know that this is a well-produced series that looks and sounds nice, but just be careful about repeating what you learn from it.",1300233600,99,1632,4.800711743772242
4228450,5,B003YCYZBG,"I picked this up thru Time Life, it is the French version (not narrated by Martin Sheen) and is quite excellent. It comes with a 4th DVD...the making of, with English subtitles. It is fascinating..but also quite graphic..and sad too.",1298419200,13,233,4.85

4228455,5,B003YCYZBG,"This is an extraordinary, must-see film. Although it is a documentary, it is as gripping as an action thriller. It is stunning to realize how close our ""civilized"" world came to self-destruction just 75 years ago. This was the era of film, and film every army and country involved in the war did.

4228466,5,B003YCYZBG,"I found this outstanding and almost as good as ""Apocalypse World War I"" by the same producers/directors. Much of the film footage they used I have never seen before in WWII documentaries, and the script is well written and keeps one interested.  The occasional use of amateur film video taken during the war was also a wonderful addition to the film.  I can't  recommend this documentary and the other ""Apocalypse"" videos (WWI, Hitler, Stalin) enough. They are fantastic learning experiences!

FYI, in response to some review comments, the blu-ray played perfectly in my blu-ray player and the narration was in English. The user can select the language of preference.",1468281600,4,667,5.091743119266055
4228467,2,B003YCYZBG,"First of all, let me clear in saying that this actual series is awesome and visually stunning when considering it's 70+ years old footage. It's a great series. My low score review is for the misleading format of this package. I bought the multi-format so I can show the DVD to my students using a non-Blu-Ray DVD player; however, it came with ONLY the Blu-Ray format and will not play in anything but a Blu-Ray DVD player, which we don't have in our classrooms.  Had I known this, I would have just ordered the DVD format to use in the classroom. I felt misled and will be complaining to Amazon.",1466121600,,595,4.409090909090909

4228472,4,B003YCYZBG,"Very disappointed in the narrator being switched. I found the original one on Netflix with Martin Sheen. Much better. I agree with several of the below commentary: Alot of regurgitated footage, too much about ""battle of France"" which was not significant compared to ""battle of Britain"" "" kirsk, "" ""Stalingrad""  and most iratating to me and completely neglected was the story if the ""afrikacore!"" Erwin Rommel was a biscuit away from seizing Egypt and thus encirclement of the British in Africa and the middleast. More focus on the generals and the amazing strategies they encouraged. My favorite: ardeens attack resulting in total encirclement and what could have been anhilation of the French battalions as well as the British expeditionary force. : Eisenhower, Patton, Macarthur , Rommel, Meinstein,  Beck, Yamashita, Gerring, De gual many others. Tactics played a huge role!!!! I also know for a fact that Hitler's first plan was not ""invasion of France."" more focus on china and their envolvment in crushing the Japanese.

4228474,4,B003YCYZBG,This documentary gives an excellent overview of the events of World War II and perhaps its stronger point is its breathtakingly vibrant footage which has been remastered and colorized making it all seem more recent and relevant. People already knowledgable about this topic will find little new information here however and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to World at War as a scholarly documentary.,1454889600,,402,5.2

4228476,5,B003YCYZBG,We collect and watch a lot of World War II documentaries. We have seen some of the footage on other documentaries. But this one (Apocalypse) presents some that we had not seen before. it is very well put together.,1448928000,,213,4.487179487179487
4228477,4,B003YCYZBG,"Very well done, but felt a bit rushed at the end.  This series really needed a minumum of 8 hours and probably 10 to 12 to feel complete.  That said, the content was masterfully edited and the pacing through the first half was well done.  Some new footage is shown here.  The score also delivers, sounding both ominous and large, which fits well here.",1448755200,,351,4.4375

4228480,3,B003YCYZBG,"This series alone, would not provide enough detailed information about WW II in my opinion.  That being said, worth watching for WW II aficionados.  Be prepared for a few non-neutral viewpoints.  There are many, but that's subjective based on your take on the war and world politics.  One example is detailing the internment camps in the USA, in which Japanese Americans were sent.  They were called something along the line of ""American shame"".  That, after hours of so many others around the world, murdering others without a second thought.  All kinds of ethnic cleansing, etc.  To look back and judge an entire nation, just recently dragged into a world war, losing battle after battle, is weak and judgmental at best.  I believe the writers were French, the same people that has allowed Muslim immigrants to dictate their will.",1446681600,,832,4.971014492753623
4228481,4,B003YCYZBG,"Amazing documentary... a little disappointed because i was expecting to hear the British narrator.  Same script though. Highly recommended.

Saw it a few years ago and was very impressed with the remastered images in color. I've seen this version but i feel the British narrator sounds more into it than this version.. still i enjoy it

The OST by kenjy Kaway uts nothing but amazing too. I'll try to get it for my collection",1443398400,3,425,4.716216216216216
4228482,4,B003YCYZBG,"I strongly recommend this to all World War II history buffs. The visuals are truly unforgettable and the narrative is very nicely done.  I am withholding a star because the French team that produced it emphasizes the British,  French and Russian roles in winning the war and deemphasizes, sometimes shamefully so, the American role. To cite one example, the voice-over makes it seem that  it was primarily British paratroopers who dropped behind enemy lines on the night before D-Day. The sources I've checked indicate there were approximately  13, 000 American paratroopers and 7,000 British. Moreover the British tried to persuade Ike not to order the jump believing the paratroopers would be slaughtered. Also the film comes down firmly on the side of those who maintain that the fire bombing of Dresden, which burned more than 20,000 civilians alive, was justified by the city's military importance. It would have been better  to say that the bombing  remains controversial today. Understandably and appropriately the French team makes it clear that the French soldiers  fought bravely during the German invasion despite being disastrously outmaneuvered . And they remedy the failure of the many accounts of Dunkirk to mention the  French soldiers who held off the Germans  to permit the evacuation.",1441756800,8,1303,5.256038647342995
4228483,5,B003YCYZBG,"Saw Part 1 of this documentary on cable TV and was blown away by it.  I am a lover of WWII history, this is very well done, and saw tons of footage that I have never seen.  Looked online to purchase a copy of it, and at first I thought it was just a 60 minute doc.  I was willing to pay for the Blue-ray version of only 60 minutes; after I ordered it I realized there was 2 discs and over 312 minutes of footage!

4228490,4,B003YCYZBG,"I own this documentary (a Christmas gift). Visually stunning, with a lot of European Theatre footage evidently not seen before in the US.

But there are glaring errors. For example, calling the USMC fliers on Guadacanal ""the Black Sheep"" instead of the Cactus Air Force. Or stating that the Battle of the Tenaru River was fought before arrival of the Ichicki Detachment, when they were the losers in the battle.

I may be nitpicking however. I think the series should be required viewing for all US HS students.",1422144000,,511,4.795454545454546

It's raw and violent but very poignant as it conveys the bedlam that was WWII.
The technical aspects of this film are unbelievable. Old footage is cleaned up and colorized so that it is a realistic and intelligible presentation. The narration is also excellent. This film tops my vast collection of war documentaries.",1422144000,,531,5.045454545454546

4228531,3,B003YCYZBG,"This French production purports to encapsulate World War II in a set of three discs of 280 minutes duration in total but there is a heavy emphasis on the European and Russian theatres of World War II, and in particular, the French role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. The crucial battles in the North African Campaign and the entirely separate and massive Pacific War receive relatively brief coverage despite the fact that German victory in North Africa would have given them control of the Suez Canal and the vital Middle East oilfields, and Japanese victory in the Pacific in 1942 would have threatened Hawaii and Australia and seriously transformed the strategic situation in Europe and Russia. If the United States Navy had been defeated at Midway, local political imperatives would have forced President Roosevelt to defend Hawaii against planned Japanese occupation. This situation would almost certainly have delayed D-Day by at least a year, and possibly seen a Russian army reach the English Channel.

No mention is made of the fact that the Chinese were holding down at least thirty Japanese divisions throughout the Pacific War. The Chinese earned their place at the signing of the Japanese surrender. The Americans and Australians did all of the heavy lifting in the Pacific War, and earned their places at the Japanese surrender but I fail to understand why the French were at the signing in Tokyo Bay when they collaborated with the Japanese in Indo-China and contributed no significant military support to the defeat of Japan.

Being a French production, we should not be surprised that far more time is spent on the Battle for France than on the Battle of Britain or the Battle of the Atlantic despite the fact that the two latter battles were arguably among the five most important battles of World War II. In coverage of the North African Campaign, no mention is made of the lengthy and vital Allied defence of the port of Tobruk over twelve months which was a constant thorn in Rommel's side and forced him to land his reinforcements and supplies at Tripoli, including fresh supplies of tanks, and move them across 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of exposed desert when his front line neared the border with Egypt. While Tobruk remained in Allied hands, Rommel's supply lines were constantly stretched to breaking point every time he approached the border with Egypt. In the Pacific War, the Battle of the Coral Sea (May, 1942) is completely ignored despite it being Japan's first strategic defeat and the fact that it laid the foundation for the massive defeat of the Japanese navy at the Battle of Midway (June, 1942). The Japanese defeats in the lengthy and bloody Papuan and Guadalcanal Campaigns (both early 1943) forced Japan on the defensive for the rest of the Pacific War but neither campaign rates a significant mention in this French production.

My advice to those interested in balanced coverage of World War II is to choose the magnificent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-at-War-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0002F6AH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>, and for much better coverage of the Pacific War look elsewhere.

I have watched many hundreds of hours of archived World War II film, and feel that the researchers have done a remarkable job in unearthing film that I have never seen before. Much of the archive war action footage of the European and Russian theatres appears to have come from  WW II German and Russian military and propaganda sources, Wehrmacht soldiers' personal filming, and other private sources that include filming of intensely personal scenes of civilian suffering.

Considerable effort has gone into restoring the archive film covering the European and Russian theatres by removing scratches and blotches, and the rendition in colour is quite extraordinary. The production has been colorised in such a way that the injected colour appears perfectly natural and never garish. The only exception to colourising is in the scenes depicting Nazi and Japanese brutality towards their victims. These scenes are depicted in the original stark black and white.

Less care has gone into coverage of the Pacific war and restoration of archive film. The coverage of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in this film has errors, such as promoting air attack leader Mitsuo Fuchida from commander to captain and placing him on the carrier Zuikaku instead of the flagship Akagi. The archive film of the Pacific War is mostly very poor quality by comparison with archive footage from Europe and Russia which is mostly very good. This can probably be explained by the heavy emphasis on the European and Russian theatres. Of Hirohito as Japan's war leader in the Pacific War, this production makes the absurd claim with regard to Emperor Hirohito ""Did the emperor know (about the atrocities committed in China)... he reigns but does not govern"". The researchers for this French production have not done their Pacific War homework adequately. Hirohito was not a token leader of his military but a ""hands-on"" commander in chief who approved every major Japanese military action, including all of Japan's military aggression. His aides-de-camp were active on every front.

The French producers make the naive assertion: ""Along with imperialism, the underlying cause of World War II is racism"". The underlying cause of World War II was not racism but greed for the territory and resources of other countries. Nazi and Japanese aggression was fired by extreme militarism in both Germany and Japan. Racism was employed by both the Nazis and Japanese to justify their military aggression to their own people. The Nazis despised Jews and murdered six million of them. The Japanese despised the Chinese and murdered between five and ten million civilians and prisoners of war by horrifying methods including burying them alive and burning them alive in mass graves.",1357430400,7,5987,5.203319502074689

Brilliant innovation.  As to the action, well the Americans still get the lions share of credit (as it should be) but it explores other minor nations efforts in removing fascism from europe. Plus the plight of civilians often ignored in other documentries.  I found when watching the ""Extras"" that it could have been much more graphic and gory had they included footage of a tank salvage (thankfully in B/W) that was left out of the main feature, plus 100's of feet of previously unused film that had to be culled due to costs.  well worth a look...

Some detractors said the narrators voice was ""boring"". I didn't think it was, but I did wonder about some pronunciations he used, made me think he was not American, but without any accent.

I was also surprised to find out that when Gen. MacArthur was forced to leave the Philippines, he spoke the immortal words: ""I'll be back"". Maybe he thought it was Gen. Schwartzenegger.

For God's sake, we have XXI century, many books were written since the end of WWII, many archives were opened, many myths have been cleared up. Still it seems the ultimate level of western history documents did not change much. If the set was marked with History Channel label I would have known better. It wasn't, so they got me fooled and took my money. And it was beginning minutes of the first DVD.

If one is interested in poorly colored rehashed movie sequences, some of them improperly applied to the context (you know, Danzig had majority of German population so it would be hard for German navy to bombard the city and it would be hard for German soldiers to be welcomed by mob of angry people upon entering the city) then the set might be worth few bucks.

Well it's perfectly normal, as this was originally produced by a joint France-Belgium venture and of course will have a tid bit more for them.

Rest assured, it covers the War at large and I have learned tons from it.

This being said, I find this English version not marketed well enough, as it is presented solely as an action packed (which it is) documentary, whereas in French it is featured as a documentary about and against totalitarianism and its effects on civilians (with a civilian perspective!).

It is the only documentary that has a created a tremendous and lasting effect on me, with the level of stress and goosebumps raising by the episode. I have shared this documentary with many of my friends and colleagues, and it had the same effects on them, rarely have I seen unanimous reviews on any production like this (be it a documentary, a movie, or else).

I have seen the original French version of course, and it's narrator is also detached and neutral, as in the English version, leaving the viewer to make up his own opinion without any hints from the narration.

The aspect that makes this series fantastic is the footage..it is some of the best, if not THE best I've ever seen.  Especially German military footage, I don't think I've ever seen another documentary on the second world war with better footage of the Wehrmacht.  A lot of the footage in Apocalypse you won't find in any other series, or if you do it will most likely be in black and white and not remastered in HD.  This is a more cinematic presentation of the war, with no interviews to break up the continuity.  The sound is also a great selling point for Apocalypse, because it's in 5.1 surround.  If you have even the slightest interest in WW2, pick up this one.

There is some startling footage that is not for the faint hearted, but most of the narration is rather bland, somewhat childish (In a little French village, little French children sing a song...) and often incorrect about WWII details.  I also found that the producers/director were rather over concerned with the French contribution to the war, stating numerous times how 'hard' the French fought.  I have actually had this argument with friends and if the French had truly fought hard they would have made the Germans turn Paris into a pile of rubble similar to the way the Russians defended Stalingrad or the Germans Berlin.  Before you flame me, it is fine if they did not fight as hard as the Russians, but lets look at it realistically, they simply did not put up that stiff of resistance.  They also seem overly concerned with De Gaul and he appears in the DVDs probably as much or more than Churchill or Roosevelt.",1314057600,6,1021,4.65

Some of the footage fell short of telling the whole story, like the part about the bombing of Monte Cassino in Italy. Much of the new footage focused on the eastern front. While the development of the Soviet air force played a large part in the battle, it was overlooked in this dvd. The pacific war footage showed the battle for Saipan and said that it was the place where B-29s took off to attack Japan, and they covered the atomic bomb drops on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although those attacks were launched from Tinian and not Saipan.
