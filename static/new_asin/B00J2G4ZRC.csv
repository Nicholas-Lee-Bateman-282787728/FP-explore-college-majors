8647430,2,B00J2G4ZRC,"Absolutely core to the premise of the original movie was the idea that the hero possessed a near-superhuman photographic memory, allowing him to instantly recall any image or document that he has ever seen, which in turn regularly helped him cleverly get in and out of tight scrapes. It was a clever idea, but in this version, his memory gets scarcely a mention, and all but a couple of his memory ""flashbacks"" have been cut out (most critically during a climactic chase scene through a cornfield), leaving his character to appear as little more than a run-of-the-mill TV detective with a bad 70s haircut.",1504224000,2,605,4.826923076923077
8647431,4,B00J2G4ZRC,"Not too shabby for 1972-3 era TV show that I recall watching back in the day.  Laurence Luckenbill stars at government researcher Glenn Garth Gregory who has a photographic memory and works for an obscure agency called the Delphi Bureau.  This DVD is only the pilot episode and holds up pretty well over 40 years later unlike a lot of shows from that era.  The plot involves a corrupt government bureaucrat played by Robert Crane (escaped from Stalag 13 finally) who's in cahoots with an agra-business smuggling weapons to overseas buyers.  Gregory is sort of a MacGyver type who uses his super memory to get out of trouble rather than fisticuffs or gunplay. This edition has been edited to remove the progressive limericks at the commercial breaks as other reviewers have noted.  Also, they cut out the scenes showing Gregory recalling things with his photographic memory.  At one point he's being dragged underneath a combine and in the original he's shown remembering schematics for the tractor and what hose to pull off to cut the fuel supply but this version shows him just yanking the hose.  Anyway,  enjoyed watching this again and hope they release the entire series.",1474329600,,1175,4.898989898989899
8647432,4,B00J2G4ZRC,"I remember the original broadcast: each segment started and ended with a limerick. At the end of the movie, the entire limerick shown. I liked it because it was humorous and and it moved the movie along. This was cut from the movie I ordered and I was disappointed because the movie became choppy--the limericks made the transition smooth. If they reissue this with the limerick lines between scenes, I would like to replace my copy with that.",1456963200,4,443,4.6923076923076925

8647434,1,B00J2G4ZRC,"Very disappointed.

When this was first shown on TV in the early seventies it was a very good movie and for the most part it still is.
However there was one feature to this movie that was very clever and unlike anything before or since. It made it very memorable and is probably why many of us wanted to finally get a copy of it.

When it was on TV right before it broke for each commercial it would give a line to a poem. As the movie progressed it gave you an additional line until at the end when the poem was complete.

The poem has been completely cut out. There is no line given where it broke for commercials and there is no complete poem at its conclusion.

It is still watchable but that aspect was what made it memorable and clever. With it removed it is nothing more than a slightly above average TV movie.  The only reason someone would want this is if they had seen it in the past so they already remember the plot. So buying this makes very little sense.

Without the clever poem aspect it is not worth the money. If you saw it in the past you already know everything about it and seeing it again doesnt make it better.
It is now just an average  TV movie like the hundreds of others made in the 70s.
The one aspect that made this movie better than any other was removed.

Lord only knows why the studio would ruin it like this.",1422144000,17,1342,4.134615384615385

8647436,4,B00J2G4ZRC,"Finally able to get this on DVD!  It's a quirky made-for-TV movie, really the pilot for a short-lived TV series. Loved seeing it again.",1409270400,,135,4.625
8647437,3,B00J2G4ZRC,"Although this is an excellent print, it is severely edited from the original version of the film. A poor quality bootleg of ""The Delphi Bureau"" has been on the collectors' market for several years. The bootleg runs almost 17 minutes longer than the print on the Warner Archives DVD. I put both copies on at the same time to see what was cut out. There is a minute cut out at some points, and two more minutes cut out at other points...It's not like a whole chunk has been lifted out of just one section of the film, but there are plot points that are missing as a result of the editing...It seems that the Warner Archives print was prepared for 90-minute time slots, while the original film was made for a two-hour time slot...I'm very disappointed by the editing.",1398729600,16,764,4.464285714285714
