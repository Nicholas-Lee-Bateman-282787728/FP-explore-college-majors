7904497,5,B000006I1D,"This version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit ran circles around the VHS version
but, once the Special Edition dvd came out with a full frame (version) and proper Widescreen (version) with a laundry list of new extras
This version got knocked out quick

This is a middle of the road LD
If my memory is correct the audio was Dolby Stereo
The PQ was decant when you put it next to the home video vhs version

If you are a massive collector i guess this is a must have that all depends there are much better versions now between the Special Edition dvd then the 25th Anniversary blu ray",1449100800,,577,4.284403669724771
