8104790,5,B000E31E0S,"I love Korean movies and have been a fight fan most of my life, so maybe I'm an easy mark here. Nevertheless, I believe this film is an outstanding study of two very opposite boxers. One a washed-up 43 year old Olympic Silver Medalist who gets beaten up for money on the streets, the other a teenage thug who ends up in juvenal
detention after a mugging. The two stories don't cross until the final bout.

In the process, both evolve from being unpleasant jerks, who disrespect their families, to being... average. Characters, fighting, story-lines, etc. are very realistic. Thought you won't fall in love with either boxer, you'll probably wish both could win the big fight.

Movie may seem a bit slow and slightly long at 135 minutes but I think it's worth it so I recommend it highly, especially to fans of boxing and Korean film.",1381190400,,833,4.621621621621622
8104791,4,B000E31E0S,"We've seen this before (read ""Rocky"") where a fighter, in this case a bygone amateur champion, needs to rise to the occasion and regain a past glory. There's a twist to this one that separates it from the rest.

Here's the scoop. Gang Tae-shik is a former boxer of some note but his glory days are behind him. He now tries to make money by having the average Joes take out their frustrations on him by beating him up for a price. He might lose his wife, apartment and son so he takes a stab at title bout. Then there's a petty criminal (Yoo Sang-hwan) who learns to box in prison. He's troubled but might find salvation putting in for the same bout. Do you think these guys might end up in the ring together?

This is a nifty little flick. The viewer is introduced to the two main characters and gets a decent chunk of their back story to build up empathy for them and see what drives them to this do or die situation. Both these guys are likable to a certain extent. They're not a bad lot. They're just kind of screwed up. Gang wallows in self pity. He lives in his past. Yoo just can't seem to keep out of trouble and has ""dad"" issues. He's self destructive. But what is cool about this is their stories aren't overblown. This is low-keyed Hollywood. And the fight scenes almost don't look choreographed. It's almost as though the two were given a general outline, went into the ring and went at it. It's all very natural looking. Even the training scenes were more low-keyed. No ""Eye of the Tiger"" here. One of the biggest surprises was the music. It's filled with a lot of Southern, slide guitar blues. Weird seeing a Korean flick with a blues soundtrack.

Though not the greatest film ever made by any means, this is still one of the best of its type.",1377129600,,1756,4.331306990881459
8104792,3,B000E31E0S,"By the end of Jumeogi unda (Crying Fist), we were so tired of seeing Choi Min-Sik lying drunkenly on the pavement covered in his own vomit that we almost gave the laptop screen a double jab.

A two-hour boxing-as-life metaphor, Crying Fist's plot is two-sided. In one corner, we follow Kang Tae-shik (Choi Min-Sik), an aging ex-champion, penniless and hard drinking, who makes change for scraps by offering himself as a human punching bag to stressed out Seoul pedestrians. With a terrible temper, onsetting medical problems and seemingly complete disconnect from modern life, Tae-shik embarrasses his young son (a very adorable Lee Gun-ju), exasperates his wife (Seo Hye-rin) and tests his friends' patience. With creditors hounding him, he seems to be at a soon-to-be-literal dead end... until he learns of a new boxing tournament, which might be just the thing to raise him from the gutter (or knock him out one final time).

In the other corner, we follow the young Yu Sang-hwan (Ryu Seung-beom). Overflowing with energy and frustration, Sang-hwan is a tightly-wound ball of nerves and anger. After being thrown into juvenile detention for petty thievery, he chews off another inmate's ear (nutritious!) and is hence condemned to boxing practice (FOREVER). Here, Sang-hwan finds the perfect outlet for his bad-ass ways, and his sudden passion for the sport impresses everyone. When his father (Gi Ju-bong) is then killed in a freak accident, it's up to Sang-hwan to be the man of the house. And his only exit from a life of poverty and crime is boxing. The upcoming tournament seems like just the ticket he needs.

Thanks to this set-up, the audience is set up for emotional torture during the tournament itelf, as the film has taken great pains to familiarize us with both competitors. It's an impossible match, as both characters are equally needful and equally sympathetic. And indeed, the finale is a bit of a cop-out - an overly facile conclusion to an otherwise nervy, tough film.

Choi Min-Sik has a strong dash of the demented in him (something he shares with Gary Oldman, yay!) - and he's exhibited a great, Dionysian wretchedness in previous films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chihwaseon/dp/B0001611CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chihwaseon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oldboy/dp/B0029SCFE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oldboy</a>. In Crying Fist, this same wretchedness tires - if only because it feels so one-note. There's never a moment when Tae-shik is not a pitiful, brutish ""coulda-been-a-contender"" has-been; we get no sense of hidden dimensions. Ryu Seung-beom is better as the younger Sang-hwan; his swings from howling rage to steely determination, as well as his maturation into a solid young man, are great (a story is supposed to be about a character undergoing change, after all!).

The filmmaking has a canned, overly saturated look, which is quite pretty and made us a bit inexplicably hungry (bi bim bap anyone?). Themes of how using violence as an expression of anger or national pride is quickly becoming outdated in metrosexual Seoul were interesting - but not as interesting as the evil corporate American monster that crawls out of the river in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Host/dp/B000PKG8TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Host</a>. Decent, but there are better films featuring boxing, anti-metrosexualization or Choi Min-sik.

8104793,4,B000E31E0S,"I'm a fan of Ryoo Seung Wan's previous movie (Arahan), though I thought the pacing was a little off in that one.  This movie is wonderfully paced and sustains its interest throughout.

The movie itself follows two boxers who both look to redeem themselves through their sport.  The first is a young punk who finds boxing as a way to focus himself.  The other is a former silver-medalist trying to put his life back in perspective.

Typically, a poorly made movie about a character trying to redeem himself through his sport falls for making the character initially dull and lacking pathos.  Yu Sang Hwan, on the other hand, is quite sympathetic while being disturbed at the same time.  Kang Tae Shik (played by the star of Oldboy) is down and out, but certainly has enough dignity to make him someone to root for.

But what most amazes me in this film is how the climax involves an entire bout, from start to finish, without cuts, to really let the drama of the sport itself come through.  This movie should be put among one of the greats when it comes to boxing movies.",1154476800,3,1070,4.53125
8104794,4,B000E31E0S,"Way better than movies like 'Rocky' or 'Million Dollar Baby'.

If you like Oldboy it has the same star and director. The story is about an old boxer down on his luck - so down on his luck he rents himself out as a punching bag- and a young directionless thug who takes up boxing while in juvenile detention. You watch them build themselves up and find new meanings in their lives and they don't even meet until they both enter the same boxing competition and end up in the final bout. It stays away from happy endings thank god. Great movie, the Koreans have a lot of good flicks these days.",1149206400,4,591,4.276785714285714
