I believe it was a combination of the haunting musical score which i was never able to get out of my head, or the great acting, story line or my interest in reincarnation. This movie is a masterpiece and a treasure.  I was able to buy a copy of this film about ten years ago. It wasn't a good  copy the audio was low and the picture very blurry. I bought it from Columbia House. If i didn't know better i would have though it was a boot-leg copy. Never the less, i'm still glad i have this and wouldn't part with it for anything unless of course it was transferred to DVD.",1031443200,12,699,3.9857142857142858
428369,4,6302035570,"A pretty difficult movie to come by, Reincarnation of Peter Proud is a gem of a movie. Having first seen it during its initial release in the early '70s, I had not seen it for 25 years. Upon tracking it down, and outbidding some other eager fans of the flick, I anxiously awaited its delivery. It did not disappoint. It had that weird aura about it which complemented the subject matter of the film: Reincarnation, obviously. The cinematography, musical score, and quality acting set this film apart and make it worth owning. It definitely captures a very unique style which you don't ordinarily see with today's films. If you like movies that will make you think about them long after you've seen them, then Reincarnation of Peter Proud is a good choice. Stars a pre-Superman Margot Kidder.",1011657600,38,791,4.781021897810219
428370,5,6302035570,"I saw this movie when it first came out and have wanted to see it again for 25yrs! It still holds the power it did back then. The flashes of another life and the search for the unknown part of life that is destiny.

428569,4,6302035570,"An interesting film. College professor Peter Proud begins to have flashbacks, dreams of places he's never been to. He sees himself being murdered in a lake. He investigates and finds out that some of the landmarks he saw are located in a town in New England. He goes there and finds himself being drawn into a murder that occurred 30 years before... his own murder.

The movie tells a great story, although the production values might have been tightened up a little. Even if you don't believe in reincarnation or are interested in the topic it is still worth watching.",1447632000,,569,4.69
428570,2,6302035570,"One of my friends and I often have discussions of reincarnation and she frequently references this movie, so one day I decided to research it. Turns out this movie's based on a novel so I checked out the book from the library. The book is better than the movie because in the book, Peter did more research other than go to a sleep lab/psychiatrist. He consulted with a psychic and a paranormal expert and seemed more interested in truly discovering the meaning of his repetitive dreams.

**SPOILER ALERT**
The main problem with the plot is that the character never took the opportunity to have a real dialogue with his wife (from his previous life), find out why she murdered him, and seek closure/reconciliation. In the story he went on this journey to discover why his wife killed him and to stop the repetitive nightmares. When the time came for him to confront his wife, he neglected to tell her that he was the reincarnated dead husband and failed to find out why she murdered him, even though he supposedly went on this journey to find out. Instead, he gets sidetracked, develops a romantic/sexual relationship with his daughter (from his previous life) and tells his wife that he intends to marry her daughter.

I want to sympathize with the protagonist as I often do when watching movies, but I don't sympathize with this one.  He was a jerk in a previous life and never made any attempts to right the wrongs of his previous life.  One can argue that he didn't know about his past life (although he did get some clues that he was a jerk) but he wasted his opportunity to discover the true nature of his previous incarnation.

This movie is so-so for entertainment but is definitely overrated.  It had so much potential but was wasted on a superficial plot.",1439424000,2,1764,4.637820512820513

428630,4,6302035570,"I remember my mom telling me about this movie when I was a teen in the mid nineties, so we checked it out of a video store and I could see why she never forgot this movie. It fits in with the seventies movies I tend to like such as Audrey Rose, Burnt Offerings, The Sentinel, even Amityville, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby. It doesn't have to go for mass gore effect, or stay super edge of the seat thriller to keep your attention as it just simply makes you question, what would it be like to find such indisputable proof that reincarnation is real? To live again but retain so much of your last life, to feel compelled to act out your past all over again? I checked back off and on to see if they ever put this movie to DVD format, and had no luck. So when I checked this time I was pleased to find it on Amazon. Coming from korea everything on the back is written only in korean so anyone not already knowing what the movie is about may need to find that info online. The quality of the picture and sound were nearly identical to renting the old vhs copy, just had the convenience of being on dvd. It did automatically play in the english language, so you didn't actually have to find a way to put it in english. The case felt sturdier than most dvd cases I own, the back artwork looks like something from an old novel. It may not be a cleaned up enhanced copy, but I like the atmosphere the old vhs rental style offers on movies like this, some how more reminiscent of the past for me.

428634,5,6302035570,"I hadn't seen 1975's ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" in decades, but Deadline Hollywood published a new interview with director David Fincher (""The Social Network,"" ""Se7en,"" ""Zodiac,"" ""Fight Club"") on 19 September 2014, which happened to mention this movie (Fincher's seeing ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" in the 1970s is what made him decide to become a film director, although his comment reads like he wasn't that impressed with the film and thought that he could have done a better job of directing it).  That got me thinking about the movie again.  Even though I had fond memories of ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,"" watching it again after decades actually exceeded my already high expectations.  The movie hasn't lost any of its power.  It's well-acted, well-cast (Michael Sarrazin, Margot Kidder, Jennifer O'Neill, Cornelia Sharpe), well-directed (J. Lee Thompson, 1962's ""Cape Fear""), and well-written (Max Simon Ehrlich, who wrote the novel, ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,"" also wrote the screenplay).

This is obviously a movie about reincarnation, nonetheless an important theme usually overlooked is that it's also a movie about free will and predetermination.  The story of ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" can be interpreted to mean that, in the grand scheme of things, free will is an illusion and everything is predetermined.  This is why, for instance, professor Peter Proud (Michael Sarrazin), despite innumerable opportunities to do otherwise, can't help but make the choices he makes, neither can he avoid the inevitability of his fate.

On 9 November 2009, it was announced that David Fincher, along with Andrew Kevin Walker (writer for the movie, ""Se7en,"" which Fincher directed), plan to do a remake (or more accurately, a readaptation) of ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud.""  According to this report, Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures will finance the project.  Five years later, however, and this project is still stuck ""in development"" (which means it may or may not ever get made).  If it ever does, then there's a good chance it would lead to the 1975 version of ""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" being properly released on both DVD and Blu-ray (although that might happen eventually anyway).",1411257600,2,2246,5.298591549295774

428781,5,6302035570,"""The Reincarnation of Peter Proud"" is a movie, of the suspense-thriller genre, that was released in 1975. It concerns a Californian college professor, Dr. Peter Proud (Michael Sarrazin) who is traumatized by recurring nightmares that haunt him. One evening, he sees a local documentary on the television entitled, ""America Past & Present."" He is increasingly rattled, filled with dread and fearful when sees his very 'visions' being played out in front of his eyes - yet it is of a place that he has never seen or visited before. He becomes more and more convinced that he has been experiencing flashbacks of an earlier incarnation of himself. He finally manages to visit the American town that features in his dreams and finds himself unwittingly in the company of  the wife of his previous birth - Marcia Curtis (Margot Kidder). Marcia soon discovers - to her increasing horror - that Peter shares startlingly similar behavioral characteristics with that of her late husband, Jeff. Peter manages to befriend Marcia's daughter, Ann (Jennifer O'Neill) and soon finds himself romantically involved with her. Marcia suspects Dr. Proud as being the reincarnation of her dead husband, Jeff and she wastes no time in recognizing the incestuous nature of this relationship - since Ann was, in reality, Jeff's daughter in his previous life. Marcia finds herself in a dilemma that offers no easy escape plan.  She finds it more and more difficult to keep Peter and their daughter apart - but in doing so she will have to share with Dr. Proud the horrifying moments of their last encounter - she would need to reveal to him the gruesome details of a crime that was committed many years ago.

Even though this film might seem dated, it is still, in my opinion, one of the best representations today of the philosophy of reincarnation and 'life after death' - a controversial concept of rebirth (after biological death) that has been scientifically proved as existing. If you enjoy movies concerning the paranormal/the supernatural, then I strongly suggest that you go in for this one. It is good value for money and a worthy buy indeed!",1352592000,9,2126,4.949579831932773

The movie keeps your attention throughout and after it's over you wonder about all the possibilities of how anything like this could ever be and the depth of the imagination of the writer and the director.  Now, when I view a 70's movie, I find that many were corny and predictable.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons this film sets itself apart.  I have not seen anything else during this time in regards to time travel other than the series travel in time and since Somewhere in Time and Well's Time Travel.  All of these movies had intriguing appeal...perhaps because there were so few movies that had time travel with depth appeal.  Hundreds of war movies have been made, many science fiction thrillers, but not much in time travel.  When these movies come out with Good Actors, good directing, and lots of imagination/depth, they leave the viewer wondering all the possibilities of time travel.

428850,5,6302035570,"This is a fantastic mid 70s (not early 70s as other reviewers have written) thriller that still has not been put on DVD.  Please read the other reviews for a film synopsis.  Thanks to those reviewers who shared their familiarity with the film's locations.  For me, I love 70s movies, and this movie is a great example of why.  The filmstock provides a perfect dark coating to add to the creepiness of a man obsessed with finding out why he was murdered in a previous life.  As one reviewer noted, there is a definite sexual undercurrent to the film.  This is not a movie for kids.  'The Reincarnation of Peter Proud' explores the idea of reincarnation in an intelligent way while keeping the viewer interested in what happens to the characters.  The acting is top notch, and though there are some holes here and there, I found that they did not detract from my appreciation for this movie.  I like the way Sarrazin abandons everything in his present life to pursue the woman who WAS HIS DAUGHTER in that previous life.  Also, the movie has a fated quality to it, which (I believe) has an intoxicating affect on the viewer.  See this movie, and contact the studio and urge them to put it on DVD, ASAP.  It's that good.  Also, if you like the dark, gloomy feel of this movie, and the soundtrack music is largely responsible for that, I recommend you buy October Rust and Bloody Kisses by a band called Type O Negative.  They are (sort of) a combination of Black Sabbath and The Doors:  slow, heavy, dark, gloomy, with the type of thick vibe that bands today almost NEVER have.  Their music is a world unto itself.  It stands apart from trends, radio, etc. and has a medieval feel to a lot of it, without sacrificing melody or punch.  They are THE BEST BAND you've never heard of--",1111968000,14,1778,4.485981308411215
428851,5,6302035570,"I recently received this film as a gift.  I must say that being a lifelong resident of Western Mass, made this film especially interesting for me.  The acting and plot are simply okay by today's standards; however, I'm also a Jennifer O'Neil fan, so it did keep my interest.  I am writing this review to help those who are interested in locating landmarks in the film.  The beauty of this film, unlike so many others, is that when they filmed it, they didn't simply film the exteriors on location and film the interiors back on some soundstage in Hollywood.  They actually filmed the interiors from within the actual buildings themselves.  One example is the lobby of Baystate West (now Tower Square), in Spfld., where Peter asks ""if there are any rooms available"" and gets advice on where to locate ""Crystal Lake"" (a fictional lake).  A large portion of the film was shot in Springfield, Longmeadow and Holyoke.  There were also some shots filmed in Amherst, MA and Deerfield, MA as well.  Matter of fact, the scene of them enterring the lobby of a hotel (where Peter experiences back pain), was filmed at the Lord Jeffrey Inn in Amherst.  It is an establishment that is still there today and the granfather clock in the scene can still be found in the lobby at the inn.  If you visit the Lord Jeff, be sure to have dinner.  They have a spectacular menu.  The house Peter finds (it actually turns out to be his boyhood residence), is located in the McNight section of Springfield, MA on Cornell Street, off of St. James Ave.  The intersection that he is stopped at before he rounds the corner and parks his car to get out and talk to the girl washing the red Volks Waggon is Wellesley Street and Cornell Street. That view from that corner is unchanged, although some of the homes are different colors today.  Other locations filmed were the approaches to the Mass Turnpike in West Springfield, MA (at I-91).  You will also see signs for Ingleside (a section of Holyoke, MA), which is now the location of the Holyoke Mall at Ingleside (exit 15 off I-91). You will also see them venture into Deerfield off of I-91.  They have lunch at the Deerfield Inn (this is the point where Peter explains there is no time to go to Plymouth Rock, etc.).  The scene where Peter and his girlfriend pull up to a lot behind Baystate West (when she exclaims she wants to be taken to the airport and return home), is a parking lot today.  The Hamden Savings Bank Bulding is still there; however the tower of the city hall/symphony hall building can no longer be seen from that vantage point due to modern buildings obstructing the view.  The Yankee Peddlar Inn in Holyoke is also still there (Rt. 5 Holyoke).  The view of the mills along the canal in Holyoke when Peter and his girlfriend drive by is unchanged.  The ""Puritain Statue"" is located at The Springfield Library and Museums (Quadrangle) on State Street in Springfield.  The statue is actually of Deacon Samual Chapin, a founder of Springfield MA. The country club in Longmeadow is still there too.  As you can tell, I loved the movie because it literally is ""close to home"" with me.  I hope you enjoy it too.",1110758400,28,3149,4.580357142857143
428852,5,6302035570,"Back in the summer of 1974, they were advertising in the Springfield Newspapers the fact that this movie would be shot in this locale.

They were looking for ""stand-ins"" for Jennifer O'Neill & Michael Sarazzin, and did a small write up in the Springfield papers.

It was very exciting and I saw the movie for the first time at the cinemas at Eastfield Mall, in Springfield Mass.

I remember the movie was rated ""R"", and i was 19 at the time. I brought two younger friends with me, and was their ""guardian""!!!

Anyway it was exciting to see parts of Springfield, Longmeadow, and Holyoke Mass filmed for this. Here are some little bits & pieces of information that may interest you all........

The main bridge you see is the ""Memorial Bridge"" that goes between Springfield & West Springfield Mass. They recently did a huge reconstruction of that bridge and finally finished in the past 4-5 years!!! It looks fabulous~~

The bridge that Peter Proud & girlfriend stop on is the Route 5 bridge~~ still looks exactly the same as it did~~ only i laugh because you couldn't stop where they stopped to look at the memorial bridge for a million dollars~~ They speed like demons around there, because there are several ramps where traffic meets to go over the Route 5 bridge~~That's Hollywood!!!!

That Pilgrim statue that they keep showing is over at the Springfield Library & Quadrangle over on State Street. The Chestnut street apartment tower is right near there. At the time that was filmed, the Chestnut tower was still in construction and still stands completed today~~

One night, or on several nights, my girlfriend Colleen and i would drive in her car looking for the house that has that erie little stained glass window~~~ Well, one night, WE FOUND IT!!!!

I can't remember the street name, but it's in the section I onced lived in when i was four~~~ There are a bunch of College named Streets in the area between Bay Street, and Saint James Avenue. I know because i lived on Amherst Street. I went back to that area with a friend who also grew up there about 11 years ago, and it still is kind of spooky out there~~ The house was gold at the time, and that little octagonal window was lit, just like the movie!!! The couple who owned that house had still owned it in the mid-1990's, not sure of ownership now. But that area is lovely~~ filled with Victorian houses. It was magic!!!

All i can say is one night, get in your car, play ""Tubular Bells"" by Mike Oldfield on your car CD or tape player, and hit all the side streets off of those streets that are named after colleges. You will be pleasantly and spookily surprised!!!",1091836800,18,2628,4.584221748400853

428854,5,6302035570,"I saw a watered down version of Peter Proud when it was released in India in 1976. Years later, I saw a pristine print on VHS. What an incredible film this is. Brilliantly directed by veteran J.Lee Thompson, this film sends shock waves down everyone's spine probably even today. Yes,it is high time that is released on DVD/ Casting is perfect. Michael Sarrazin & Jennifer O'Neal are excellent. Margot Kidder as the cold killer is frighteningly evil! Outstanding score by Jerry Goldsmith enhances the rather eerie proceedings. Screenplay is perfect making this film almost flawless.",1078444800,22,581,5.126315789473685
428855,4,6302035570,"I saw this film in the mid-seventies at a West Chester University campus film event. I was impressed immediately with the subject matter (Reincarnation) and spent the time riveted to my seat until it was over. As others have stated, you will not forget it once you see it. The reason that it has such power is that it focuses on what all of us would like to do, and that is discover who we were before! The film is about a man who consistently has dreams about living a previous life in the recent past. He discovers that his dreams have a basis in reality when he recognizes the town of his dreams presented in a documentary on television. A search begins and Peter Proud tracks down all the dream clues, discovers his previous identity, and the film builds in excitement as we know that he was a murder victim in the previous life. Eventually he locates his old home and finds out that his family is still around. He uses a clever way to introduce himself to his old family and several strange psychic-like feelings and habits of saying things, tapping on glasses, etc. begin to arouse the suspicion of the former wife that her husband has come back to haunt her due to her guilt or that Dr. Proud is up to some bid for blackmail because of what he knows. In an amazing scene, his ancestral mother in a nursing home spiritually recognizes her son in the embodiment of Peter Proud and the daughter chalks it up to dementia. Proud becomes romantically involved with his daughter and drives the former wife to re-commit the actions of murder again in the spirit of Deja Vu in a great climax to the film. The most interesting aspects of this film are Springfield Mass. scenery, a 1937 Cord convertible with hide-away headlights, the amount of women sexually involved with the character and the overall angles in the filming that promote the mysterious aspects of this work. A charming work from the 70's and though dated it still draws you into the plot.",1075507200,72,1952,4.53257790368272
428856,4,6302035570,"See this one along with ""Play Misty for Me"" on some slow Sunday evening, particularly if you're over 35 and remember the 70's.  OK, this film is a bit schlocky and ""softcore"" (err, ya know what I mean) but intriguing nonetheless.  Love the Jerry Goldsmith score featuring the Moog Synthesizer.  Never gets worse than ""so bad it's good,"" so -- it's good.",1075075200,9,353,4.661290322580645
428857,4,6302035570,"Michael Sarrazin plays ""Peter Proud"".  This man continues to have the same dreams over again.  They are terrifying dreams to him.  He secretly keeps a diary of them to validate the frequency and his memory of them.  The first dream the audience sees is a naked man swimming at night towards a little boat Margot Kidder is in.  he apologizes for the fight they had earlier.  Suddenly she hits him in the privates with the boat oar and he drowns.  This man looks nothing like Peter Proud, but Peter's nightmares become more erratic and strange.  His lady friend played by Cornelia Sharpe becomes concerned.  He decides to seek professional help tp talk to someone more openly about it.  I will not say anymore about the plot.  The beginning of this film is probably something we can all relate to at some time of our life.  Debralee Scott and Jennifer O'Neill are also in this film.  Look for the recognizable actor, Steve Franken who plays ""Charles Crennis"" in this film.  Steve Franken has done many films including the Jerry Lewis film HARDLY WORKING (1980).",1054166400,6,1059,4.715846994535519

7821571,4,6302035570,"This is my Four Star Placeholder!  Freakin' hallelujah! Distinctly remembering this film from when I was a child - it periodically played on TV in the mid 70s early 80s - the thing that needed to be Reincarnated was this film!  Essentially, this movie has been MIA since it's release - a whopping 43 years!  I've always wanted to see it again, and see if it holds up to my fond memories of it, watching it on TV when I was 11 or 12. So here we finally get after all these years a 4K restoration! I can't wait. As a side note, I am very interested in seeing this again because of the actors. Michael Sarrazin, who although always worked and deserved to be much more well known, never truly reached his star potential. The fact that this movie was out of print for so long did a real disservice to his filmography, truly being one of the few high profile films where he is the lead. We also get the interesting and sexy Jennifer O'Neill who is still most well known to horror fans from David Cronenberg's Scanners. She represents another actress that has had an underutilized career. Finally, we have Margo Kidder, who essentially flamed out by the end of the 80s - her Superman movies being the go-to for her legacy; so it will be interesting to see a performance here.

I am ordering this movie, so come back after the release date for a full review! Will it hold up? We'll see. Now if we can only get a DVD release of The Reflecting Skin,  Prosperos Books and Erendira.",1522454400,,1470,4.350364963503649

7821573,3,6302035570,"I can't say this is a ""GREAT"" movie, but it does hold my interest because I'm from Springfield which in many ways was featured like another cast member.  It's very interesting to see my home city in various stages of construction at a time when the economy was SO VERY, VERY MUCH better, and optimism abounded.
My dad's business supplied some of the cars for this film, and I watched it very closely when it debuted in local theatres.  In one scene Margot KIdder drives up in one of my dad's cars and the electrical tape used to control reflections on the side-view mirror is clearly visible ( I remember peeling it off when the filming was completed).  Well, NOT on this dvd:  The video quality is about that of a often-viewed VHS tape, which doesn't affect the plot line, but be aware of what you're getting.
One sad note:  Watching Debralee Scott was heart wrenching since her demise came as an indirect result of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.  Google it and lament her wonderful spirit.",1515196800,,1004,4.55

I defied my mom and stayed up until 10 PM to watch the whole thing (in my darkened bedroom on a tiny TV with the volume turned down as low as possible) and I felt that it was a fine example of supernatural storytelling. I was ten.

Now I am 49 and just purchased this for old times sake and I can see how dated and very flawed it is - but it was still a little fun to watch just for a laugh.",1505692800,,442,3.6041666666666665
