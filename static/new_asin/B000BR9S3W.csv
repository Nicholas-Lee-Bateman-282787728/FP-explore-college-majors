8091372,5,B000BR9S3W,"Greetings;

A good series, I enjoyed it greatly, for time it lasted. I bought up the whole series recently and as good as it was, I was only really annoyed with how short it all was, no real resolution. I have the whole english Manga series as well as well as the fan book so I know more or less how things progress thus far. But still, that was just...Underhanded. Ending it like that-not enough happened. More Dears from the series were not introduced, more of the plot was not explored. Honestly, it feels like there should be a season 2 but honestly, I won't hold my breath. to be sure, there are many series that do that, even ones that go so far as to show artwork or early animations for another show to come-Knights of Ramune had Warrior lime, I think it was, in the works. Animations for a future series, but from everything I have heard, nothing ever came of it, which really is a shame. Still, I can always hope and dream. I can also be bitter about how unfinished it feels or that there likely won't be more to come-especially after all this time, but no, no. I mean, I will be, but no just now.

I just don't see why nearly none of the copies on amazon are under $30. I was lucky enough to get mine for about $12 or so I think, but still. This isn't the complete series, nor is it the edition of volume 1 that comes with the box to hold the 4 volume in it. There is even a complete collection that is usually produced overseas with a 0 region coding which looks just fine from everything I have seen of it-the only real extras you get with the 4 volume set is mini-posters, if they are included at all. Either way though, A very nice series, even the theme songs were pretty good, which I was a bit suprised about.

Thank you and take care...",1293580800,2,1755,4.186390532544379

I'll say this, wether you watch in English or Japanese, both have a strong cast.  This series was produced well, and I really enjoyed it.",1215820800,2,289,4.39622641509434
