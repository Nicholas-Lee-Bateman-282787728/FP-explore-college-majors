7749797,5,B01FE6VOHC,I loved the movie! It kept me thinking! Great cast! Excellent director! Highly recommend,1463443200,,88,5.357142857142857
7749798,1,B01FE6VOHC,"Look, I have a soft spot for grade z indie horror, but this is bad beyond ""z"" or any letter known to humanity. No rating exists to quantify its awfulness. Seriously, this seems like it was made by high school students on a smart phone. No script, no ""acting,"" HA, no plot, no ghost, no scares, the MOST amateurish single film I have EVER seen.",1463443200,12,343,4.292307692307692
7749799,5,B01FE6VOHC,I disagree with the bad reviews.  I am extremely picky when it comes to movies and I liked this!  No it wasn't gory and grotesque so if that's what ur looking for you won't find it.  But I thought it was a great story line and I didn't notice any bad acting and believe me I see it alot on a certain TV channel.,1484265600,,311,3.828125
7749800,5,B01FE6VOHC,Creepy...And that's a good thing in a horror movie.,1481155200,3,51,4.777777777777778

7749806,1,B01FE6VOHC,Very low budget. it starts out decent but gets very cheesy all of a sudden.,1478736000,,75,4.066666666666666
7749807,1,B01FE6VOHC,"Uninteresting to me so much so that I couldn't finish it , it may have turned out great for all I know but I highly doubt the awful acting improved.",1478649600,,148,3.966666666666667
7749808,1,B01FE6VOHC,The pace was too slow for me. Even the simplest actions took forever. I understand the desire to build suspense but this was too much. I turned it off.,1478390400,,151,4.241379310344827
7749809,3,B01FE6VOHC,why do they make these scary movies so darn dark you can't see anything???,1478390400,3,74,4.357142857142857
7749810,4,B01FE6VOHC,"I love a good creepy cornfield movie and this one is no exception. If you enjoy other cornfield flicks like Children of the Corn, Dark Night of the Scarecrow or The Husk you need to add this to your list of creepers. Heather is driving her friend and sister home from a night at the club, she doses and runs into a girl in the middle of a backroads cornfield. When they get out of the car, she has vanished into the cornfield leaving behind a ghastly trail of blood. After they return home the doorbell rings in the middle of the night. There is no one there but the run over girls bloody nightgown was left on the bed. It will definitely keep you on the edge. Well shot with good cinematography, good sound, good effects and quiet good acting. Definitely a thumbs up for me.",1478390400,,775,4.27891156462585
7749811,1,B01FE6VOHC,I was so disappointed with everything about this movie- slow and  suspenseful  is one thing but boring is another- acting and story line terrible,1478304000,,145,5.0
7749812,5,B01FE6VOHC,"I love this movie by Ryan Calloway. The acting was great, and the movie was scary. There were also relatable funny scenes, making it a very entertaining experience.",1478044800,2,164,4.892857142857143

7749815,4,B01FE6VOHC,"Usually when I read the reviews I notice there are a bunch of ""reviewers"" saying those five star reviews must be from friends and family or actors from the movie. Let's flip the script here. This was a decent indie low budget horror movie with a decent storyline. Nothing great, but entertaining nonetheless. So I will say beware the one star reviews because they are either kids or those looking for the cgi effects.",1477699200,4,417,4.648648648648648

7749817,1,B01FE6VOHC,"Terrible movie.  I would give it zero if we could.  Poor acting, poor storyline and just plain confusing in the beginning.  I should not have wasted my time.",1477612800,,157,4.535714285714286

7749820,1,B01FE6VOHC,Movies that get 1 star mean that they are so bad even I can't finish them.,1477353600,,74,3.6875
7749821,1,B01FE6VOHC,Shut it off after a few minutes. When is someone going to make a decent horror movie? I've seen nothing but crap lately. They border on comical.,1477267200,,144,4.37037037037037

7749825,3,B01FE6VOHC,was ok,1477094400,,6,2.5
7749826,3,B01FE6VOHC,"It's a low budget film with first time actors, so know what you are getting into. With that said, the story was pretty decent and was creepy in some parts. When you see that the writer is also the director and producer of the film, that will give you a heads up to not expect any academy award type of stuff. Like I said, low budget, first time actors.",1477094400,8,352,4.115942028985507
7749827,5,B01FE6VOHC,"I LOVED IT!!! Excellent creep factor and made me jump several times (which is rare for me, lol). Worth a watch for sure!!",1477008000,3,121,4.304347826086956

7749830,5,B01FE6VOHC,"Now this is my kind of creepiness, I loved it. Good actors 4 the most part. And it was no girl in the cornfield it was a grown woman, 30 years after she died. Creepy cool movie, it's a must see.",1476748800,3,194,3.7560975609756095
7749831,5,B01FE6VOHC,"I'm a big fan of the genre horror, so when I found out about the Girl in the Cornfield, I decided to see if it was any good. Luckily, it was really interesting!

Ryan Callaway did an excellent job with this film.

I thought the best actor in this film was the young sister. Watch out for that little one. She is going to be a rising star. The actor who played the part of the news reporter didn't really do a good job acting, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.

I really hope there will be a part 2. I'll definitely give the sequel a watch.",1470441600,,542,3.9541284403669725

7749836,2,B01FE6VOHC,"While dozing and driving drunk one night Heather (Briana Aceti) bumps into a woman in a white dress on a dirt road in a Pennsylvania corn field. She and her hot Asian friend Corrine (Tina Duong) follow the blood trail to nowhere. Tiffany (Madeline Lupi) Heather's 11 year old sister is also in the car. Heather had to pick her up after she got booted out of acting class.

Well is seems ""woman in the white dress"" (Mollie Sperduto) managed to follow them both home. Heather defends herself with a golf club because rural Pennsylvania homes don't have guns. Special effects include doors opening and closing by themselves. Things appear, and then when the camera moves away and comes back, it's gone. That was apparently all the special effects the Polonia brothers had time to teach these guys in one day. Couldn't afford a big fake looking rubber mask on their budget.

The acting left a lot to be desire. Briana Aceti managed to do the scare face, unfortunately it got stuck in that position as did her line ""seriously"". Tiffany Browne-Tavarez as the newsgirl (the one that reports live local news at 3 AM) was noticeably bad, especially in the car scene. Victoria Guthrie, the Caucasian mom of the hot Asian chick was also less than convincing. The film also liked introducing new characters at an hour into the film, most likely because they were drinking buddies of the director ( Ryan Callaway) or the director himself.

Filmed in Egg Harbor City, NJ. Pennsylvania corn fields have fireflies.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Briana Aceti in ugly plaid pajamas and not a tank top and panties. Naked feet walking slowly on carpeting with humpback whale noises providing additional scares. 1 1/2 generous stars

8760677,1,B01FE6VOHC,"the only thing frightening about this movie are people driving at night on long, dark, deserted rural roads, especially if they're surrounded on either side by even more frightening cornfields. This is obviously just an irrational phobia of mine but I don't like these Children of The Corn scenarios.

I told those girls to stay out of the  cornfields, but no, they just had to keep going back; nothing good ever comes of running around cornfields except if you're harvesting.",1485302400,,476,4.9375
