I guess sometime in the future they will release the four overtimes becuase on the menu is says Disc 1 of 2. I understand that but Amazon needs to let everybody know that this the case. I remember the game and it ran about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so it's hard to fit all that on DVD-R that gives ultimate quality and this game has that. The game quality looks like today's standards. I was impressed with that just dissapointed that the whole game wasn't there.",1197849600,,568,4.317757009345795
