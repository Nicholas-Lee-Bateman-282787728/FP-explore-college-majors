7843113,5,6303258026,"George Szell was one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and this video contains sensational rehearsal and performance footage of performances of Beethoven's 5th, Brahms' ""Academic Festival  Overture,"" and even a bit of the Berg Violin Concerto.  The video is a  must for anyone who appreciates what *The Penguin Stereo Record Guide*  calls ""Szell's extraordinary achievement in Cleveland.""  Please  note that the video is composed of a 1966 television special on Szell and  the Cleveland, produced for ""The Bell Telephone Hour.""",938563200,11,541,5.445783132530121
