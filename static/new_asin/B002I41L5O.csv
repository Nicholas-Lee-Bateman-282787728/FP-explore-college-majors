3935890,4,B002I41L5O,"Funny movie.  If you are looking for a raunchy, funny movie watch this one.  It has dialogue and acting not like others.  It goes out of the norm of regular scripts.  Very funny.",1355875200,2,178,4.303030303030303
3935891,4,B002I41L5O,"Bill Zebub's poignant dark humor is a little juvenile, but very entertaining. I stumbled upon The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made while cruising exploitation films. After seeing that I was hooked. There are 4 availlable for download on Amazon, and I have seen 3 so far. Do not watch any of these movies if you are easilly offended or take yourself too seriously.",1324080000,7,359,4.714285714285714
3935892,5,B002I41L5O,"Bill Zebub is the bastard cousin of John Waters and Rob Zombie. If you can grab his style, it's his best work yet. I am a fan of some of his work, and hate most of it. ""Dirtbags"" is easy to laugh at because he knows how to make himself laugh. Fat Slob Druggy moron on a couch masturbates and takes drugs. A minstrel show black-face drug dealer and numb-skull Christian daddy interact as the script becomes didactic with a statement on human behavior. All an excuse to offend those who don't get Bill Z. Like watching a stand-up comic wizz on the guy in the front row who won't crack a smile. Thats the Joke! Go with it, and watch this movie from the back row.",1285286400,10,659,4.196850393700787
3935893,1,B002I41L5O,"I do not typically write reviews. I am writing this one in an attempt to save people money and time. I don't think this movie has a plot. There's a fat guy who is allergic to bees and has a dad who is very religous. Then you have Bill the main character who spends a lot of time on the sofa talking to his friends. There are some other characters in the movie that really do not add anything. The acting is awful. They probable had a budget of $100 dollars and it shows. So if you like losing money rent this or buy it, but I do not recommend it.",1275868800,17,546,3.9279279279279278

8370707,1,B002I41L5O,"The title and the ""banned in 69 countries"" should certainly let you know what you're getting into, but even with low expectations to see a movie that was funny and politically incorrect, this garage film failed on just about every front.

Another reviewer wrote that this was the joke-to offend all who hate Bill Zebub-no. Not even far-reaching rationalizations such as this can save the lack of plot, low-budget, backwoods group of friends that bands together for a couple of days and films a bunch of random attempts at shock footage and offensiveness.

Seems like some good ol' boys, complete with 80's hair and mullets, love sitting around drunk and high and doing incredibly boring things. At times in the dialogue, you get the feeling that the director thinks himself smart and clever in writing lines of the script.  Lots of repeated shallow and superficial statements and arguments against religion that attempt to come across as new, deep, revelations.  Watch Bill Maher or George Carlin if you want to see legitimate arguments pointing out inconsistencies in religion; otherwise stay away from drugged-up atheists ranting about how they have some kind of supreme, know-it-all, knowledge.

A couple of memorable scenes from this ""movie"":
A guy in horrible ""black-face"" poses as a drug dealer to one of the movies main characters(an overweight slob who is allergic to everything) and only manages to say ""black,"" ""crack,"" and ""mama,"" then leaves the scene. Reminds you of some good ol' boys making fun of minorities-not funny even when looking through a non-politically correct lens.

A boring dialogue between a metal head and a girl he is trying to screw over, where he pulls a string from her bikini, unknowingly yanking her tampon out and throwing it across the yard, right into some angry and aggressive good ol' boy's mouth.

Maybe if they rehearsed some of the awful script a bit more, had alot more talent at acting, had a bit more money to spend on a non-shaky cameraman, and achieved a college degree from a decent institution, maybe then this movie would have a chance at a toilet-humor B-movie.

As it stands, just a bunch of random jibberish, juvenile ideas of gross behavior, very juvenile attempts at shock humor, and the feeling afterwards that you just got a bit dumber for watching this.

I think the ""banned in 69 countries"" is either made up or just a fact that at least 69 countries don't watch our movies anyway-the international community would not give this backyard film the limelight to even rate it. Maybe Bill just wanted to look clever and put 69 in the title.

Tried the worst horror film by Zebub just to see if another movie might do something-same group of backwoods cast-couldn't make it through half the movie without gouging my eyes out.

I am now blind. Thanks Bill Zebub.

Rent this if anything, but I can almost say with certainty that you will regret your purchase.",1360627200,5,2913,4.862626262626263
