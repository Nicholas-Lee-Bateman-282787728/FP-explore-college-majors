7542321,5,B0189I11B6,"It's Fixed. This is the version to buy.  I am enjoying episode one right now. It looks fantastic. Buy the version with release date of December 8, 2015.

DO NOT BUY THE October 13, 2015 VERSION.",1450224000,58,194,4.361111111111111
7542322,5,B0189I11B6,"I got my hands on a copy of the corrected set [UPC: 841887027380 / ASIN: B0189I11EI].  At the bottom of the set on the shrink wrap is a sticker with the new UPC. If the sticker is removed, the old UPC is underneath on the box and there likely will be no way to differentiate between the bad set and the new corrected version.

**WARNING** Please make sure you are purchasing [UPC: 841887027380 / ASIN: B0189I11EI] some large Amazon Sellers have the flawed version linked to the review section for the fixed set.

I selected Blu-ray Disc #4, at random, and sampled as well as compared to the older DVD versions. It looks really nice and everything that was advertised. Picture is noticeably better than the original DVD and 20 Anniversary [150th] set, but then again so too should any property transferred and mastered Blu-ray over it's DVD doppelganger. Grain structure thankfully was left intact and as a result the detail on many of the photo's and other footage is striking. You can freeze frame and actually read many of the presented documents. Please note I've only looked at the fixed Disc 4 thus far.. Kudos to PBS for correcting the set, but sad to think many not in the know will be receiving the bad Oct 2015 version this XMAS and they'll never realize how great what is possibly the best all-time hours of TV programming can really look.

One major beef; this is an expensive home video set, peppering it with GM, BOA commercials etc wreaks of an insulting cheesy cash grab. Over the air fine, but when purchasing the home video edition I feel it is a morally bankrupt action.  Regardless of the ""reasons"" shame on you PBS and Ken Burns you no longer have the 'right' to take the moral high ground.",1449792000,141,1710,4.57516339869281

7542386,2,B0189I11B6,"Disappointed! From the reviews I read, this was supposed to be a relatively unbiased account. It was half-hearted at best. In regards to the content, I appreciate the visual account of the time period but as for the historical account, this documentary series is lacking. An example is the naval battles. It was glossed over but it was also inaccurate. I understand there are time constraints but when you describe the most notable ironclad battle and still refer to the CSS Virginia and the USS Merrimack, it is a problem. You live and learn.",1519344000,,543,4.787234042553192

I had read on Prime video that if you bought the disc through Amazon you would be able to stream the program. This is what I wanted to do to start with. At any rate, that was not the case. Good news Amazon refunded my money. I went to Amazon Prime and was able to buy the program in HD for 44.95 ( a bit higher) but the quality is outstanding, exactly what I hoped for on the original disc.

7542430,1,B0189I11B6,"I received my order today and am very disappointed. I ordered the DVD version with the displayed graphic of it being the 25th Anniversary Edition, but that is not what I received as far as I can tell. The picture of the product does not match the product I received and it is unclear what was actually sent.

All the comments here are about the Blue Ray version and some of the comments are about an edition which went backwards in quality and was actually worse than the old VHS version apparently. So I have no idea what I have received and because I purchased the set new and as a gift to a friend, I cannot preview it to check the quality! Also, I purchased an older DVD version months ago (not the 25th Anniversary Edition) and it has 10 DVDs, yet this one has only six. How does that work?! Why are there four less DVDs?!

The bottom line is that I thought I knew what I was buying, but now have no idea what I have in my hands! The comments are for the Blue Ray version; the box is not as shown in the graphic; the information on the box is unclear; my older version has four more DVDs than this one; I can't find any comments for the DVD versions; and there is no information about the many, many versions which PBS has published since 1990 and their differences. The closest thing I have for a date on the box is the statement, ""2015 PBS Distribution.""

I have probably made 100 or more purchases on Amazon and this is the worst purchase I have ever made, because I don't know what I have in hand. I don't know whether I should send it back or simply trust that I will be giving my friend what I hoped to give him.",1503619200,,1623,4.146031746031746
7542431,5,B0189I11B6,"I will not bother to review the content material in this set.  If you know the content of Ken Burns' work, you know it's good.  After seeing other reviews that talked about ""good quality"" versions of the set and ""bad quality"" versions, I was apprehensive about what I might be purchasing.  I can report that the blu-ray version with the UPC label 841887027380 is of excellent quality.  The colors are vivid, the images are sharp, and the black bars on the sides of the screen are pure black on my 4K tv set.  Although this version is the November 12, 2015, release date, the disk set includes a PBS information sheet promoting other series.  One of those series is Mercy Street, which was a 2016 tv series.  So, it is my presumption that the manufacturing date of this set was after 11/12/15.",1503532800,10,792,4.535211267605634
7542432,5,B0189I11B6,I bought as soon as it hit the market 25+yrs. ago. Excelent series all the way around. The narration is great because you have a mixture of famous actors/actresses and less famous ones. I set aside a Saturday and  Sunday once a year to watch it from beginning to end. I have other series similar but this is the gold standard.,1503187200,,326,4.344262295081967

7542470,3,B0189I11B6,"I wish Burns would have the right information in this movie. I can't call it a documentary since information in it is so wrong.
The Civil war started over the southern states being taxed for their goods and the north was not. Also there is no mention of Sherman raping women and children  and killing the men left, mostly old ones, when Sherman went thru the south. (The only good southerner is a dead one) Also Lincoln had no respect for the black man saying he did not have the intelligence to vote. There is also a camp where Union placed the Negros because they did not want the negros  coming up north. There is a nice grove a peach trees there now.  Also it would have been nice if it was mention how Northerners had slaves, some were working for the cabinet, some were the rich. Bringing  out the truth of how blacks were treated would have been nice. Not all were treated badly. Jefferson Davis had a black over seer for his blacks and he let them decide justice on one who broke the law. A lot of the time Davis had to step in to stop a punishment that was too harsh",1499385600,6,1075,4.229268292682927

When watching it, you feel apart of the story, the understanding of our ancestors by way of the words they wrote and spoke.  One cannot truly understand the amount of work that went into this creation (as Ken Burns stated, it took 6 years of work poring over documents, letters, pictures and music) that feels like a labor of love for our country and the people who lived in it between 1861 and 1865.
This historical masterpiece can even shed a light on our current political situation.  Lincoln's quote ""A house divided against itself cannot stand"" reminds us of today's division and harkens back to time where ignorance and self serving behavior nearly destroyed our country and calls out to us to set aside our differences and learn to work together for the sake our nation.",1490918400,8,887,4.740259740259741

What all these men AND women went through for the love of what they believed was their country shames us today with all our whining and fussing. You'll be surprised at the extent many people hated Lincoln on both sides!  You'll be amused at the witty remarks the soldiers would make about officers and armies and situations they found themselves in. Be prepared for much gorie misery they went through.

7542558,5,B0189I11B6,"I'm not reviewing the quality of the picture or the sound, or anything but the content.

I don't understand how you can give this series anything but five stars. It brings the Civil War back to life in such a way as to really give you an understanding of what happened, why it happened, and how it impacts the America we live in today (2017). I didn't know much about the Civil War beyond what was shoved down my throat as I make my way through grade school, and actually hadn't heard about this series before I came across it on Netflix back in 2013. But once I watched it I knew I'd never forget it. The soundtrack is phenomenal. I've read that people have played the title song at their weddings.

I've seen the entire series at least 6 times now and manage to pick up some new piece of information I missed on every other viewing. There is so much information in this series it is mind boggling. As with all great films, knowing how it ends changes the way you see the beginning, so it absolutely rewards repeat viewings. This series is well worth owning at the very least as a digital copy on Amazon. I actually bought both that and the blu-ray because I wanted the special features, which are awesome by the way. Ken Burns goes into detail about how they made the battles come alive with slowly tracking shots on still photographs combined with actor voice-over and sound effects. It also helped me get a better understanding of who Abraham Lincoln was, since I only knew very little about him, again from grade school. The series quotes all of his greatest speeches, and many of his lesser known letters written to his generals during the war.

IMO the entire country needs to watch this series as one nation to give those of us alive today a better understand of what American's before us had to go through to get us to where we are today. I don't say that to degrade how we live or the society we have now, but I think it would help pull us together to have not just the knowledge that the Civil War happened, but more importantly an understanding of what is means to have this event as part of our national heritage. We need all the pulling-together we can get these days.

It really is a beautiful work of art. I don't say that lightly.",1486598400,6,2247,4.368421052631579

Narrated by Shelby Foote, expert historian on the Civil War and Ken Burns, creator of this series, this is undoubtedly the consummate documentary of this critical part of this country's history.  The narration, the photography, the historical accuracy and the incredible detail are breathtaking.
