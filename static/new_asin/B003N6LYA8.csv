8457728,3,B003N6LYA8,"The show is excellent, one of the best from Japan.  Unfortunately this DVD set is shady at best.  Image quality isn't very good.  Only season 8 has English subtitles, and they're pretty poor quality ones (think Engrish/Chinglish).  If you understand Japanese or can read Chinese, it's not such a bad deal for all 8 seasons.  I'm just going to use the Chinese subtitles.",1291939200,6,369,4.7936507936507935
