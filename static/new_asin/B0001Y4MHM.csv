8018359,5,B0001Y4MHM,"Time and tide are mixed in this story of a writer enriching her sexual practices in a life whilst refreshing past-Paris-adventure memories grounding her writings.
Since a movie arrived, many other later films embed factotum of bi-sexuality from a notion of family issues.
Whatever attitude to such a topic might be, actors look good, play good and script is logical and convincing if even decade ago moral could still refrain from showing erecting willy in a near-porno general audience movie.",1442966400,,493,5.175
8018360,5,B0001Y4MHM,"This rare picture was INCREDIBLY erotic and lovely. The price, however, should be reduced. This erotic movie has LOTS of love and bliss in her major way of sense. Paris, France is elegant!",1389139200,,188,4.7272727272727275

The story for this DVD is very thing but the sexual method are numerous. This is one of the good late night movie for couples. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film.

8018362,1,B0001Y4MHM,I was disappointed that I had to read words deciphered from a foreign language. The words were not on the screen long enough to read and still see the film. The plot was very poor. I turned it off before completion through disgust.,1127952000,2,231,4.395348837209302
8018363,1,B0001Y4MHM,"I thought this was one of the worse movies I had ever seen in my life! I actually cut it off half way thru because of it's pretentiousness and then tried again later to watch the second half only to reaize I shouldn't have listened to other reviews. I hate I actually BOUGHT this crap! Imagine Quentine Tarrantino dialogue set to Madonna's ""Justify my love"" video!!  It is that bad..{unless you thought THAT was stimulating}!

Lots of full frontal nudity does not even save it. Back and forth..""stand over there and play with yourself. NO don't turn around..now stop..now Hammer time...""..'blah blah blah, that's what it felt like to me.  I have never seen anyone work so hard at sex in my life. Why bother?

The story line was very hard to even understand and  I still have no idea why the husband was watching his gay friend take a piss. ""Now let me watch you"", ""Can't imagine taking that in my mouth"". [Yet later takes it elsewhere with Sloan! Who [BTW]does everyone in the movie with a flaccid penis.

Apparently from reading the other reviews I missed something. Just don't waste even $5 on this to see if YOU can find it!",1109721600,13,1127,4.527093596059113
8018364,5,B0001Y4MHM,I never thought that a movie of this price could have been so great.  It has a great story line and hot naked girls. It is not one of those movies that are just nudity and nothing else. All I have to say is this is a great enough movie for me to take my time and write e review.  Buy it and you won't be dissapointed!!!,1105401600,3,319,3.746268656716418
8018365,5,B0001Y4MHM,"I ordered this DVD truly not knowing what to expect considering the low price and everything I'd read about it. I'm amazed at the quality of this print. While there are no extras to speak of, the print is excellent. This Canadian film explores what happens when a writer named Lucy (Leslie Hope), who's stuck in a dull marriage, embarks on a no-holds-barred affair with Sloan (Peter Outerbridge) who's a friend of her husband's gay business partner. Sloan unleashes Lucy's pent up sexual fantasies in ways she's only written about. The film also explores our reactions to sex and all it's colors when an opportunity arises to explore them. This is one of the most uninhibited English language films I've seen outside of a Peter Greenaway film. It's shocking, graphic, funny and serious. It also features acres of equal opportunity nudity (mainly Outerbridge and Hope) that should please both sexes and those who are ""curious"". Hope plays a woman who aggressively takes an active role in her sexual relationship and is not used. Instead, she uses the man to push her buttons. Hope and Outerbridge deserve to be commended for their ability to play these characters so well considering the demands placed on them emotionally and physically.""Paris France"" is for adults only and is not for the timid (especially squeamish men). If you can swallow your inhibitions it's a rewarding experience for those who are game. The title is best left explained when you view the film. This is a great deal on an unusual and challenging  venture into very sticky territory.",1085011200,35,1556,4.938931297709924
