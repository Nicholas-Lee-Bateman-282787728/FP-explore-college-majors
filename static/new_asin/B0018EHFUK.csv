8269653,3,B0018EHFUK,English subtitles only. For me reading the subtitles takes away from these old Kung Fu movies.  Great fight scenes with some Genre legends.,1464134400,,139,5.043478260869565
8269654,3,B0018EHFUK,"This movie has the right Chinese Martial Arts stars from 1970-1990 era. However the story line was weak, silly and over complexed. Good if you have a MA collect, especially Shaw Brothers. But don't except a good plot with nice fighting scenes-its ject not there.",1410134400,,262,4.844444444444444
