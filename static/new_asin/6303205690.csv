The clash between the ever so present civilized structure and the tranquility  of nature was apparent not only in the content but in the truly masterful  editing.  One could only wish to travel to these remote locations to escape  the constant barrage of today's rigid and predictable society.  I give high  remarks to the beautifully composed music, which for the short life of the  film, whisked me away to a better state of mind.  I highly recommend this  film to anyone who is looking for more than a mindless escape from reality.  Apogee will truly enliven your spirit.",966297600,6,644,4.81651376146789
7840674,2,6303205690,"OK right off the bat i'll get the good out of the way. There is a lot of pretty imagery. Now for the bad, and there is pleanty of it. The most annoying feature for me (other than the poor transfer quality...call me  spoiled by DVD) was the constand barrage of Titles. Unlike Baraka or  Chronos, there were titles every 3-7 minutes that really broke the spell  that the images can supply. On top of that the music accompanyment is  awful. And the worst sin is the constant repitition of cities and images.  There was little flow to this video, and overall I would not reccomend it  to those seeking something similar in the Baraka genre'.",963792000,15,637,4.448275862068965
