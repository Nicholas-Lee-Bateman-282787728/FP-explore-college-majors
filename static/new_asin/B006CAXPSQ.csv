Carmen flamenco styled dance drama by Gades review

This is probably a good place to start investigating the work of Gades as it is such a well-known plot and well told by Bizet in his opera. However this example of the flamenco art combined with more traditional ballet skills as envisioned by Gades is able to extend the rawness of the emotional impact to an almost frightening degree.

Some background explaining how this fusion of ballet and flamenco came about may be of help at this stage: Gades, as a young man, studied classical dance as well as all the Spanish popular dance idioms. This dual interest and skill enabled him, uniquely, to fuse together the two art forms of ballet and flamenco. He believed that flamenco must also be shorn of all extraneous distractions in order to bring the essence of the dance to light. At this early stage he was also providing the choreography for classical ballet such as Bolero, Carmen and El Amor Brujo for companies such as La Scala. From 1981 he formed the collaboration with Carlos Saura, the film director, which resulted in some of his flamenco-based creations being filmed. These films had an enormous effect on ballet companies around the world and Gades became very influential in this way while continuing as a ballet dancer in Giselle for example.

This production brings the 1983 Carmen to our screens in an amazingly effective performance. The music includes specially pre-recorded Bizet extracts played by the Suisse Romande orchestra with considerable brio. The majority of the music however is pure flamenco - two guitars, solo singers and clapping. Precision ensemble dance to massed multi-rhythmic clapping has to be seen to be believed! The scenarios presented crackle with sexual tensions and competitiveness and an unmistakable underlying and ever-present threat of violence. This is not just between men but also between women and between the sexes. This is an artistic statement beyond any of my previous experiences and I found it gripping. This is not the same as comforting. There is not a moment of tenderness to be seen - not even in the highly disciplined acknowledgement of the final applause.

It is likely that non-specialists of this art form will fail to pick up or begin to understand many of the underlying meanings in all of this - subtitles would have been invaluable in the frequent sung parts, but this is not a good reason to deny this full acknowledgement. The recording is all that could be wished for and there is a bonus in the form of interviews with members of the team. The sleeve notes are particularly informative. This issue delivers an unforgettable experience and essential guide to a dramatic art form.",1341878400,16,3180,5.0495238095238095

Now that this is finally also available on Blu-ray, many would rate this as the strongest contender for overall best buy especially as it pairs two of the finest singers available today in the key roles of Carmen and Don Jose.

Both Garana and Alagna naturally dominate this production, and as they comment in their brief interview between acts, they both feel that their earlier experience of working together on Carmen in London has enabled them to further develop their working relationship. The result is clear to see as there is an unusually high degree of dramatic tension created between them throughout this production.

In this performance Garana shows Carmen to be effectively focussed on her abilities to generate straightforward sexual desire in men she fancies and, as such, portrays a readily identifiable character type which will be fairly familiar. When apparently spurned she simply wishes to turn her attention to alternative options. This Carmen does not display the same level of inherent vindictiveness to be found in van Otter's Carmen at Glyndebourne or the violent unpleasantness portrayed by Antonacci at Covent Garden for example. This remains a very strong and believable portrayal of Carmen in its own right however and one that Garana clearly revels in.

Alagna is on top form here and gives a fine performance of a role that he has been closely identified with for years. As mentioned above, the previous on-stage partnership with Garana in Carmen has allowed a further deepening of the Carmen/Don Jose relationship which adds considerable veracity to this production.

The remaining roles are also well done with Barbara Frittoli an especially believable Micaela and one that Don Jose might well have been happy with under better circumstances. She is a stronger and more attractive portrayal than many rivals in a difficult role to project. Teddy Rhodes delivers an effectively self-possessed Escamillo with a suitably strong voice and matching characterisation. The remaining supporting roles are all of the same uniformly high quality.

The setting of this Carmen is noticeably less sumptuous than either the Glyndebourne or Royal Opera productions which are particularly strong in creating apparently historically accurate and detailed scenarios. This Met production, although effective in its own way, does not really match either of those rival performances. Given the excellence of all three productions as regards both singing and acting, this may be a key matter for consideration for some. Nevertheless, apart from that consideration, no-one should be disappointed with this Met production.

In summary, both Alagna and Garana are both on top form and achieve real dramatic intensity together. They are given excellent support from the rest of the cast and the orchestra under the talented Nezet-Seguin. The camera work is involving and of good imaging quality and the sound is presented in clear DTS-HD plus stereo quality. The usual Met backstage interviews and comment form the bonus material.

As mentioned in the title to this review, there are now three fine modern but contrasting Carmens for purchasers to choose from. All three are capable of generating enthusiastic support seen from their differing perspectives and will satisfy a considerable range of personal tastes and responses. All three are worth the full 5 stars in my opinion. Final choice will therefore be a matter of personal preference which must lie outside the scope of this review.

4983455,5,B006CAXPSQ,If Bizet were alive he would have acknowledged that Elina Garanca IS Carmen! She has to be everything he envisioned and more.,1339200000,3,125,4.7272727272727275
4983456,5,B006CAXPSQ,"I have heard and seen many a CARMEN, but never has Carmen been portrayed in such a gloriously slutty way as by Elina Garanca in this Met production! This Latvian diva just oozes blatant sexuality, and I am totally smitten.  It doesn't hurt that her mezzo is to die for, and that she is absolutely beautiful to behold. And, as if that weren't enough, she can really dance. When I Googled her, it turns out she's a blonde, but in her black gypsy wig, she owns this role, and I'm having a hard time imagining her singing anything else. If you don't buy another opera this year, don't miss this one!

Now to the rest of the cast:- Roberto Alagna sings Don Jose pretty well, although vocally his best days are behind him and he's getting a little pudgy. His native French helps his enunciation in this role, though. He has sung this part with Elina Garanca before, and they have an obvious rapport. Teddy Rhodes, a New Zealander, was thrust into the role of Escamillo on the morning of the performance, owing to the previous choice becoming unavailable. I found him quite believable, and he doesn't overdo the macho heroic stance, as some have done. Barbara Frittoli, as Micaela, the village girl ousted by Carmen for Don Jose's affection, stretches credibility a bit playing a 17 year old - she is over 40. Vocally, she is fine, and adds some interest to a usually boring subordinate role. But all these are in the shadow of Garanca's Carmen, quite simply the best portrayal of this role you have ever seen or are likely to see. This is really a cagey and nuanced performance.

The Met orchestra responds wonderfully to  Yannick Nezet-Seguin's intuitive and rhythmic conducting. A couple of extra dances by the troupe are thrown in for good measure and are expertly performed.

Sound and video in this Bluray are flawless. Between-act interviews with the four protagonists and Rene Fleming are quite enlightening.

There has been a prior release of this production on dvd by DGG, and there are other reviews of that disc which go into the musical aspects more than I am able to do. (I am not an across-the-board opera buff - just a handful of favorites that I have grown to love!).

This is something special - Elina is now my #1 mezzo!",1337990400,25,2232,4.607052896725441
4983457,4,B006CAXPSQ,"Carmen, told through the spectacles of Antonia Gades and the Teatro Real Madrid, is a flamenco-and-Spanish-dance re-telling of the famed opera. It provides an interesting look at the culture of flamenco and Spanish dance, with the story being told through song, dance, and mime. There are also several interludes of folk-esque dances and songs for the rest of cast. Accompanying the film is a short documentary about the history of the work of art, and its effect on the dance world. If one were looking for a more balletic adaption of Carmen, I would recommend Petit's Carmen, or Alonso's Carmen. While this film provides an interesting look at flamenco culture, I personally enjoy the more balletic adaptions of this story, so I'd have to recommend the aforementioned ones.",1334275200,2,775,5.0625
4983458,5,B006CAXPSQ,"This is an excellent recording  of  Bieito's  Carmen (Barcelona 2010, live).  I  am no  regie fan, but I appreciate  good  theatre and  this  staging  is tremendously effective.  True,  this  production is  unusually violent and sexually explicit;  but  the singing- actors inhabit their parts, the  music and chorus are an integral part of the action,  the conducting first class.  There are  exciting  performances by all  principals - particularly  Alagna as Don Jos is superb - and  the  minimalistic sets  and  lighting are effective  . Most of the spoken recitatives are cut from this production  adding  in dramatic intensity.
The story is  unconventionally  set around  nineteen-seventy , in poverty-stricken  Southern Spain; all Carmen's associates are frankly criminal smuggling cars,  electronics, and hard drink/ drugs ;  It's a violent  world,  where Don Jos's colleagues are no  national army upright soldiers, but  mercenaries, under harsh  discipline in their camp and  behaving outrageously  off duty.  Our very first image of Don Jos  is when  he and Carmen catch  each other's  eye for the first time:  both seem transfixed.  In his first scene with Micaella,  while  singing of his mother and home  (and singing perfectly ) Alagna seems  already aware that  all that belongs to the past .  His lack of response to Micaelas's kiss  looks like honest lack of attraction, not repression:  this Don Jos  is reserved rather than sexually  repressed: he's  also  single-minded and absolute in his passions,  fatally combining this with the  potential  for violence in his character  (it's  past homicide, after all,  that brought him to the army).  Poplaskaya's Micaella is not the traditional innocent girl,  but  a woman set on winning her man  and - despite her uneven singing -her  interpretation  is convincing. While  Beatrice's Uria-Monzon  acting is wonderful, her  singing  is  less than ideal for Carmen - but seems  appropriate for this  older and rough-living woman .  Her passion for Don Jos seems genuine  (while it lasts) making his obsession with her all the more convincing .  Finally,  Erwin Schrott's Escamillo  is well sung  in a clever parody of this macho character: he is a beautiful  virile animal likely to attract Carmen, escaping from  Jos's  possessive passion.  Alagna's duet and fight  with Schrott and his  final confrontation with Monzon's Carmen  are particularly  memorable in itensity .
Although the newcomer to Bizet's opera  might enjoy more  a traditional  production  (eg  the MET Garanca-Alagna  DVD ),  this Carmen is a rare treat for those who  love opera  as lyrical  drama.",1325635200,12,2631,5.1911764705882355

4983466,4,B006CAXPSQ,"This production of Carmen is the best I've seen.  Elina Garanca's performance was absolutely stunning.  She is beautiful, sexy, and seductive, and totally captivating.  The second time I watched this production I watched it with my wife, and although she said nothing I could tell that Elina's seductive behavior affected her because she does not approve of that kind of behavior in women.  For this reason alone Elina's performance as Carmen should go down in the annals of opera as the best ever, i.e., when women find it difficult emotionally when watching a woman being so outwardly seductive towards men.  Roberto Alagna's performance as Don Jose was acceptable, especially when compared with Teddy Tahu Rhode's performance as Escamillo.  I can see why the wild Carmen would leave Don Jose for Escamillo.  Again, this just proves how emotionally captivating this particular performance was; and Teddy was asked to perform at the last minute!  As for the negatives.  I did not find the gypsy dance scene at all inspiring, or even believable.  It looked like a bunch of  American dancers rather than true flamenco dancers dancing in a bar in Seville, Spain.

Garana is a calculating, dangerous Carmen who can dance almost as well as she can sing -- and that's saying something. Alagna is solid, and brings a true French sensibility to Don Jos, and the two leads strike sparks off each other. Frittoli is luxury casting -- a Micaela who goes beyond the clich of the timid country girl. Rhodes is OK as Escamillo. The supporting cast is above average, and the orchestra is the Met -- simply the best in the world, with a dynamic young conductor making the familiar music sound fresh again. Others may quibble that it's not ""French"" enough, but nothing is these days. And yes, I can name singers that might surpass these in each individual role, but the present cast is outstanding, and as an ensemble they're hard to beat.",1443657600,2,900,4.738853503184713

4983476,5,B006CAXPSQ,"Prior to this version my favorite video recording of Carmen was the Glyndebourne production with Maria Ewing in the title role.  To a large extent a successful Carmen depends on a title character who exudes a near-animal sensuality.  If that is missing then all the male attention she garners comes to appear more like male posturing than something deeper and more primitive.  To a large extent Ewing captured that quality in the Glyndebourne production but I always felt her performance marred to a certain extent by the fact that she knew this, worked for it and thus communicated her striving for that quality to the audience.  I get none of that with Garanca whose sensuality is natural and not applied with the make-up.  In a word, she is terrific as is the rest of the cast.  Not a bad singer in the bunch and most (especially the principles) are fantastic.  Blu-ray picture and sound is marvelous, great in 5.1.  Staging, costumes, etc.  all fantastic.  Negret-Seguin conducts wonderfully.  I've seen him in person with the Philadelphia Orchestra (where he is the music director and principal conductor) and was interested in how he would perform an opera at the Met.

4983483,5,B006CAXPSQ,"I have had the pleasure of attending performances of a number of famous Carmens of the recent past and also a number of Carmens on DVD.  There were some really top notch Carmens who conveyed the multilayered personality of the Gypsy both histronically and musically. Truthfully, I have not witnessed a fully satisfactory performance guring the last decade or so. Therefore, I attended the new Met production in a negative mood. I mention all of this not to impress anyone but to show just how much I love this opera and to put my remarks in perspective. Without a doubt this New production and cast of Carmen is really superb in nearly every respect. While I was not to thriled with Mr. Vicar's ""Dance Prologues"" , His handling of the action and spectacle {with two exceptions} is just superb, The Chorus both looked and sounded strong and suitably in charachter. The orchestra played with spirit and accuracy the brisk Tempos set by the conductor; whose name tests my meagre spelling ability. Ms. Garanca is a real treasure. I have seen her {on DVD} in a number of really differnt rolex and her acting and singing is spot on. However I was not prepared for her Carmen. It is visually and musically one of the most gripping portrayals of anything I have ever seen. Wow. Roberto Alagna has usually benn a dissapointment to me. I heard him on an recording early in his career on which he sang the role of Nemorino in ""Elixir"" {Pre Georgiu days}/ He was really excellent. He voice sounded free and well placed-reminding a friend of mine of a young Pavarotti. But like another famous tenor, he began singing roles that required more power and volume that he possessed. He does sing well as Don Jose but his voice. He works eith Ms. Garanca very well and the last scene is truly still sounds a bit strained. He works well with Ms. Garanca and the last scene literally tears up the stage. Both the Toreador and Michaela are quite good. The Toreador is espeially refreshing, eliminating the rather cranped stance and fake bravado, we usually see. Ms. Frittole as the ""good"" girl a rather tough part to bring any real vitality to, sings very beautifully. Any one to whom I showed this DVD were as bowled over as I.

4983497,5,B006CAXPSQ,Maybe I'm simple minded but this is one of three versions of Carmen that I have in a Blu-ray release. It's must be that I can't get enough of the music and that I can't get enough of the character.,1367798400,,197,3.95
4983498,5,B006CAXPSQ,"I happen to come across a 1 minute sample of this opera over on iTunes one evening and immediately became mesmerized by the seductive interpretation of the character Carmen by Elina Garanca.  I ended up ordering the blu ray version and once the disc arrived, sat down to which I thought would have been an excruciating three hours.  Mind you I tend to stay far away from operas not due to the music but simply due to the length of the performances.  What I can now say I fell in love with this performance and couldn't believe how quickly the time flew by on this show. I fell in love with Miss Garancas performance and to date this is the perfect version and one that will get repeated viewings.  This performance also opened my eyes to Miss Garancas other works which I tend to visit in the near future.",1366934400,8,805,4.382550335570469

8496405,1,B006CAXPSQ,"This is not what I was expecting - I thought I was buying the movie by Carlos Sauros. This is just a staged version, so I returned it.",1515369600,,134,3.8214285714285716
8496406,3,B006CAXPSQ,"This radical reconstruction of Carmen is too modern for me, others may be inspired by it.",1512086400,,89,4.625
8496407,5,B006CAXPSQ,"Best Carmen I've seen in 70 years at the opera!  Garanca is the best in voice, beauty, acting and dancing!  Alagna is superb as well.  The final act is unbelievable!!",1508976000,,166,4.466666666666667
8496408,5,B006CAXPSQ,"This is a fantastic production. The casting is superb. Elina Garanca is the best Carmen I have seen. She had me with ""L'amour est un oiseau rebelle...,"" or just ""L'amour."" She is fiery, sexy, and gorgeous, with a gorgeous voice to match. Roberto Alagna makes a find Don Jose, not as good as Placido, but probably the best available at this date. The set is different, but it works well. Technically, this Blu-ray is the quality I have come to expect from the Met series, which is to say the best.",1505952000,,496,4.461538461538462
8496409,1,B006CAXPSQ,I got this thinking it was hard to find Carmen from Carlos Suaras Flemenco Trilogy. My bad I guess.,1505952000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8496410,5,B006CAXPSQ,"This is an incredible version of Carmen. Both primaries are strong and work well together.  Roberto Alagna has a clear tenor delivery and a very meaningful portrayal of Don Jose. Elina Garanca provides a clear insight to Carmen's motivations and actions because, in addition to dynamic singing, she can act. A very satisfying performance.",1503532800,,338,5.2592592592592595

8496412,4,B006CAXPSQ,"I was expecting Bizet's opera.  This is not that.  It is a story of Carmen and it includes some of Bizet's music, but if you're expecting the opera, this is not it.

It is entertaining and interesting, however.",1501891200,,210,4.473684210526316
