3023483,3,B000Y9XFW2,"I bought this DVD to use on my days off from Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp DVD, which I love. I thought this DVD would be purely core exercises, and that it would be more challenging. Boot Camp has really shaped up my lower body, but my core needs more work. This DVD is ok, it's just not as good as Boot Camp is. If I had done this DVD before Boot Camp, it might have been more challenging for me. The menu allows you to pick different workouts - the full core workout, full core workout without the 2 min intro, the express core workout (without the 15 min standing segment), or the Pilates/Yoga workout. The actual core workout concentrates on the core, but also includes exercises for the whole body. This is fine, just not very challenging. They use 5 lb weights or none at all (depending on if you're watching beginning, intermediate, or advanced). What surprised me was the Pilates/Yoga workout. I don't generally like Yoga, and only do Pilates occasionally, but I think this workout is a more challenging core workout. The ""Ab 5"" section at the beginning (the 5 core exercises Lindsay always includes) are fast paced, had many reps, and  was difficult! I think this was around 10 min of the 25 min workout. The rest of the workout includes a lot of balancing poses with movement so you have to really work your core. I think I will use this one more than the other. There is also a lot of information in this DVD. Lindsay gives a couple of informative talks about how to use your core. If you've done some of Lindsay's other DVDs, you kind of know what to expect with Lindsay, Michelle, and Amy, and also the feel for the filming and cameras. It's ok, it's just not Lindsay at her best. I'll still use it some, just not as often as I thought. I think Suzanne Bowen's 10 Minute Solutions Blast Off Belly Fat is or Suzanne's Gorgeous Core are more challenging core workouts that will really help tighten and flatten.",1370304000,6,1917,4.4460227272727275

While I really like the actual exercises in this video, the camera drives me crazy at certain points. It seems to zoom in on weird/irrelevant parts when showing a new exercise. Even after watching this so many times, I still need to see what I should be doing and I feel this video is lacking in that at several points. I would still recommend this video, but be warned! Basically every time I do this video I get annoyed by the camera work, which lead me to feeling the need to write this review.",1347235200,7,630,4.258333333333334
3023487,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I carried around an extra 10 lbs of post-baby weight between kids 1 and 2, and by the time kid #2 was 18 months I was sick of it. I dropped the weight in 2 months with this video, combined with some changes to my eating habits. Not only am I back to pre-motherhood weight, but I'm in great shape. Prior to buying Lindsey's workout for postnatal moms, I used a mainstream abs DVD for a month - and I found that my waistline was actually growing instead of shrinking because I was using the superficial instead of the deep abdominal muscles. My belly still isn't quite back to where it was before kids, but it is a HUGE improvement over just a few months ago.

I like that there are three levels shown in each of the workouts - I've been continually challenged by the DVD even as I've grown stronger by increasing the percentage of exercises that I perform at the ""advanced"" level.

I highly, highly recommend this video to moms looking to get their pre-motherhood shape back. If I can do it, anyone can. Really. Good luck!",1345420800,5,1021,4.368421052631579

3023489,5,B000Y9XFW2,"This is a wonderful workout - both fun and challenging. Lindsay is an excellent instructor with energy and she's not annoying. I enjoy working out with her! I also own a few of her other workouts, but this was my first purchase. This video really target the core from the deep muscles and will challenge anyone at any level. This is also a full body workout in addition to the core which I really like!",1327276800,,402,4.373333333333333
3023490,4,B000Y9XFW2,"I just got this video and agree with the other reviewers, I think this is a great video but not what I was expecting, I have diastasis recti and thought there would be more adaptable segments, and while there was somewhere in the back you couldn't really see what that person was doing - and the camera never goes to the side of them so you cant see the form 100% on any of them - all in all a great video - but not what I was expecting so do not think I will be using it until I get more into shape! Also some of the things she is doing I was specifically told not to do (it can aggravate diastasis - but she never ever mentions that - given that this is a dvd for new moms - seems like she should!",1326326400,15,699,3.8275862068965516
3023511,1,B000Y9XFW2,"I bought this DVD after reading all of its positive reviews.  It states it has modified levels for beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  However, the camera is focused on the advanced method at least 75% of the time.  This is really irritating especially at the beginning of an exercise when you are trying to get your form right and have to wait until the camera scans to one of the other techniques.  By then you've missed several reps and have to scan the DVD back.  It would be a much better DVD if it had a separate video for each of the techniques.  A beginner cannot get nearly as many reps in on an exercise as the video is paced too quickly.  Each exercise goes right into multiple movements instead of slowly adding each one in.  If you've been doing pilates or another program for a very long time, this may be for you.  Not novice friendly.  Go with a different DVD to get the basics down and then try this one maybe.",1326153600,13,930,4.354651162790698
3023512,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I love this workout and think lindsey definitely knows what she's talking about.  These workouts are not jarring but incredibly intense.  I feel stronger at 42 than I did in my 20's.  I just had my 4th child and with Lindsey's help, my back doesn't ache and I am much more flexible and stable not to mention the weight has come off beautifully.  I thought it would be a joke compared to my P90X but it's even better especially after a baby.  Thanks for making me a much fitter mom!!!  I love Lindsey's enthusiasm too.  Without it I'm not as inclined to stick with it.  She's wonderful... buncakes and all.  : )",1324166400,3,610,4.375
3023513,2,B000Y9XFW2,I read the reviews for this product and as a regularly active fit individual I thought it would be great. Prior to pregnancy I was using the P90X videos and thought this would be better suited to my postpartum body. Well it was not what I had hoped. The routines are chopped up to be able to tailor to your own choices but I felt it was more difficult to really find what I needed. I hate stopping over and over to change the workout. The workouts were super difficult and it didn't seem to be postpartum friendly at all. I shouldn't have wasted my money and just went back to the P90X. I am sure some people love this type of exercise but it wasn't for me. I now feel like the high rated reviews must be given by ripped ab mommy's like Lindsey.,1308009600,5,745,4.144827586206897
3023514,4,B000Y9XFW2,"If you're looking for a meaty core video, this is a great pick! I've had a whole slew of back problems since my first child and now, after my second (8 months postpartum), I'm officially ""rehabilitated"" and can get fit! I've been using this video once a week (modifying as needed) to supplement the physical therapy/core maintenance I've been doing twice a week. I have yet to move on to any of the other tracks because I'm still getting so much from just one. There's plenty of room to grow on this DVD, so you really are getting a lot for the money.

With all my back shenanigans, I've learned a lot about anatomy and muscles and all kinds of stuff, enough to know that Lindsey knows what she's talking about! She does a good job of explaining it all thoroughly enough but quickly, too. I love that she does some education as well. It's SO important to getting your body back.

I'd rather give this DVD 4.5 (I'm very careful giving anything/anyone 5 stars, a 100%, or A+, I have to be truly astounded) as it is one of the best I've seen. I rounded down. Sorry, Lindsay.

If tone or presentation of the workout video is important to you, I'll say that she's probably closer to Bob from the Biggest Loser (if Bob where a girl and a mom of young children) than Jillian or Denise Austin or I can't think of anyone else at the moment. She's encouraging, uplifting, even. (AMAZING that she keeps her smile through the whole thing) And informative. She does have that perky quality that might annoy some. It works for me. I need more perky in my days!",1297555200,8,1546,4.398601398601398
3023515,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I ordered this core DVD after already completing the 8 week challenge from Lindsay Brin's Bootcamp 2 DVD. I would have to say that if I hadn't already worked my core with the bootcamp dvd I don't think I could have gotten through one of these core workouts. They are very difficult but also very effective. I love that she works your core from every angle imaginable, no endless crunches here! There are different workout options to choose from and the Pilates and Yoga segment are some of the most challenging I have ever done (and I've done a lot of Pilates vids in the past). I honestly can't say enough good things about any of Lindsay's videos. Yes, they may not be the flashiest or have the greatest music but they WORK and isn't that what a workout video is really supposed to do? Her videos are the first that I have actually been motivated enough to commit to doing EVERY day because I see results. I would recommend them to anyone. They are challenging but if you give it time and build up your endurance you won't be sorry.",1280707200,8,1034,4.4188481675392675
3023516,5,B000Y9XFW2,a great way to workout your core; a new mom or an experienced one!!! great workout in about 40 mins.,1278979200,,100,4.05
3023517,5,B000Y9XFW2,"So many other workouts tell you that just by doing crunches you are working your core and you will get amazing abs. But Lindsay teaches you how to use your inner core--the transverse abdominus--which is much more challenging than just working the surface muscles of the abs. This is a very challenging workout! The yoga section kills me everytime. I LOVE it! Lindsay shows a wide vareity of exercises that target the core, which is great so you don't get bored of just doing the same old crunches over and over again. I used this in addition to Boot Camp 2 after my first baby, and believe me, it helps get your core solid and strong again (which at first felt like it would be impossible with how stretched out and weak my abs felt after having my baby, even with working out throughout my pregnancy). It's kind of shocking what pregnancy does to your abs, but take hope in knowing that you can get fabulous abs again if you learn how to work your core the right way! Lindsay will teach you how! She positive and energetic and fun to work out ""with"". :) And she uses real moms in all of her videos (including herself) who have been through the same struggle of getting a great looking body back that we have to go through, too! I am so glad that we finally have a fitness professional willing to teach the real secret to great abs to all of us!",1272412800,4,1345,4.341269841269841
3023518,3,B000Y9XFW2,"This DVD is ok. It doesn't excite me and get me energized or motivated, but it certainly does work if you use it regularly. I am more of a ""Dance"" person so this wasn't my favorite but it did the trick.",1272326400,,202,3.951219512195122
3023519,5,B000Y9XFW2,"This is a great core workout.  As a fellow exercise scientist, I really appreciate Lindsay's educational background and that she really knows her stuff.  She is also very good at explaining exercises, and the whys and hows of finding your core again.  Lindsay is also a great motivator, and I do not find her annoying like other video personalities.  But most importantly does it work?!?  YES it does! Lindsay has gotten me into great shape after three babes.  My core is strong now than it was before my last baby.  If you want to find your inner core, whether you have no babies or 5, this is definitely a great video for you!",1270598400,3,628,4.504424778761062
3023520,5,B000Y9XFW2,"This DVD is great if you want to get a good workout that really focuses on your core- abs and back. Lindsay has put together some great core firing exercises, some traditional 'crunches' but mostly all new stuff (at least to me!) that really works even better than crunches.  And you get your heart rate up as well, so no need to add on a cardio workout, its all in there! I really felt that my abs got much stronger. There's also a choice to do a yoga session, too, that also focuses on your core.",1270252800,3,498,4.1875
3023545,5,B000Y9XFW2,"Before I was a mom, I was competed in Olympic weightlifting. I was very tone, and I pretty much took it all for granted. After having 2 kids, my mid section really showed it, and I was pretty hopeless. This DVD has totally helped (and gave me hope!). It re-taught me how to properly use my core muscles, to do abdominal exercises (and all exercises) correctly and effectively. And I love that it has varied levels so it's still a challenge for me to complete everything. I'm so happy that my core is stronger and flatter.",1270080000,2,521,4.4375
3023546,5,B000Y9XFW2,"If you're looking for an innovative way to work your core muscles - this is it! As a new mom, I had no idea what my tummy would look like after having a baby. I desperately wanted to regain my flat tummy. This DVD offers new ways to regain your ab muscles without doing the standard crunches. I love that there are yoga and pilates influences in these workouts. It is a great way to work and retrain your core! As always, Lindsay is a great motivator and offers such refreshing advice on helping you regain your abs!!",1270080000,3,517,4.285714285714286
3023547,5,B000Y9XFW2,"This video is great when you want to concentrate on your core muscles. It definately gets me sweating, and I still haven't worked up to the highest level in 9 months. Great pilates and yoga section as well.",1270080000,,206,4.447368421052632
3023548,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I went through all of Lindsay's boot camp DVDs, and a bunch of other basic cardio routines, before even attempting this one for the first time.  So much for being in excellent shape - I barely made it through half the sets!  After two months, though, I had abs like I was 16, not the mom of 6, and I was throwing my kids all over the place in the pool, too.  Seriously, it felt like living a before and after info-mercial that all took place in less than 3 months!  Some of her terms are a little corny - but I'll take that in a heartbeat compared to the swearing on some of the hard-core DVDs, especially with lots of kids trying to work-out alongside me.  She's done her research and knows which muscles go AWOL on moms during pregnancy, and she knows how to kick it all back into gear.  Well worth buying!",1269993600,24,808,4.180645161290323
3023549,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I wish I had this DVD before becoming a mom! My spine is fused which means I can not do a lot of traditional core exercises, like crunches. With this DVD, my abs were sore for the first time in my life. I felt ab muscles that I never knew I had, and I had worked out a lot prior to giving birth. I misplaced this DVD for a few weeks, and I love it so much, I considered buying it again. i love it!",1269993600,3,397,3.6823529411764704
3023550,5,B000Y9XFW2,This DVD is my absolute favorite.  I started this 5 weeks postnatal and I followed the easiest version.  I am now 5 months postnatal and am doing the hardest version and still love it!  I feel great and my back never hurts which is amazing because even prior to children my back hurt.  I have lost all my pregnancy weight and feel firm to my core!,1246060800,,347,4.212121212121212

3023552,2,B000Y9XFW2,"I bought this DVD and it offered no specific help for a diastasis, or it at least seemed to contradict, in part, some of the information that therapists have offered about this condition. She does tell you to suck in your stomach, but that's about it. I am a bit of a stressed out mom, I know, but I can't bear that she calls the buttocks ""bun-cakes"" - a small point, but still. Also, most of the post-natal workouts have a teacher who states that she had children. She never did. Did she have any kids?",1233187200,5,503,4.25
3023553,4,B000Y9XFW2,"I've used this dvd for 2 weeks now and I believe its going to improve my muscle tone. I've finally worked my way up to doing a full 20 mins in one of the 30 min. workouts.  Lindsay is no joke! Her workouts were pretty hard at first for someone like me who is 35 and a mother of three.  I'd even thought I was in pretty good physical shape until I tried this.  I do believe that by the time I am doing a complete 30 to 45 min. workout with her I will see more results.  So far I can feel the results in my abs. I'm a petite person but 3 babies stretched my belly and when I coughed 2 wks ago it would hurt, (that's how weak my muscles had become) but not anymore. My only criticism of this video is that sometimes she switches right into other moves a little too quickly and without proper  demonstation. These are 2 things that I will overcome after using it a bit longer.",1229904000,9,872,3.96

I also own a few of her other workouts, but this was my first purchase. This video really target the core from the deep muscles and will challenge anyone at any level. This is also a full body workout in addition to the core which I really like!",1327276800,,402,4.373333333333333
3257987,4,B000Y9XFW2,"I just got this video and agree with the other reviewers, I think this is a great video but not what I was expecting, I have diastasis recti and thought there would be more adaptable segments, and while there was somewhere in the back you couldn't really see what that person was doing - and the camera never goes to the side of them so you cant see the form 100% on any of them - all in all a great video - but not what I was expecting so do not think I will be using it until I get more into shape! Also some of the things she is doing I was specifically told not to do (it can aggravate diastasis - but she never ever mentions that - given that this is a dvd for new moms - seems like she should!",1326326400,15,699,3.8275862068965516
3258008,1,B000Y9XFW2,"I bought this DVD after reading all of its positive reviews.  It states it has modified levels for beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  However, the camera is focused on the advanced method at least 75% of the time.  This is really irritating especially at the beginning of an exercise when you are trying to get your form right and have to wait until the camera scans to one of the other techniques.  By then you've missed several reps and have to scan the DVD back.  It would be a much better DVD if it had a separate video for each of the techniques.  A beginner cannot get nearly as many reps in on an exercise as the video is paced too quickly.  Each exercise goes right into multiple movements instead of slowly adding each one in.  If you've been doing pilates or another program for a very long time, this may be for you.  Not novice friendly.  Go with a different DVD to get the basics down and then try this one maybe.",1326153600,13,930,4.354651162790698

I feel stronger at 42 than I did in my 20's.  I just had my 4th child and with Lindsey's help, my back doesn't ache and I am much more flexible and stable not to mention the weight has come off beautifully.  I thought it would be a joke compared to my P90X but it's even better especially after a baby.  Thanks for making me a much fitter mom!!!  I love Lindsey's enthusiasm too.

Prior to pregnancy I was using the P90X videos and thought this would be better suited to my postpartum body. Well it was not what I had hoped. The routines are chopped up to be able to tailor to your own choices but I felt it was more difficult to really find what I needed. I hate stopping over and over to change the workout. The workouts were super difficult and it didn't seem to be postpartum friendly at all. I shouldn't have wasted my money and just went back to the P90X. I am sure some people love this type of exercise but it wasn't for me. I now feel like the high rated reviews must be given by ripped ab mommy's like Lindsey.,1308009600,5,745,4.144827586206897
3258011,4,B000Y9XFW2,"If you're looking for a meaty core video, this is a great pick! I've had a whole slew of back problems since my first child and now, after my second (8 months postpartum), I'm officially ""rehabilitated"" and can get fit! I've been using this video once a week (modifying as needed) to supplement the physical therapy/core maintenance I've been doing twice a week. I have yet to move on to any of the other tracks because I'm still getting so much from just one. There's plenty of room to grow on this DVD, so you really are getting a lot for the money.

With all my back shenanigans, I've learned a lot about anatomy and muscles and all kinds of stuff, enough to know that Lindsey knows what she's talking about! She does a good job of explaining it all thoroughly enough but quickly, too. I love that she does some education as well. It's SO important to getting your body back.

I'd rather give this DVD 4.5 (I'm very careful giving anything/anyone 5 stars, a 100%, or A+, I have to be truly astounded) as it is one of the best I've seen. I rounded down. Sorry, Lindsay.

If tone or presentation of the workout video is important to you, I'll say that she's probably closer to Bob from the Biggest Loser (if Bob where a girl and a mom of young children) than Jillian or Denise Austin or I can't think of anyone else at the moment. She's encouraging, uplifting, even. (AMAZING that she keeps her smile through the whole thing) And informative. She does have that perky quality that might annoy some. It works for me. I need more perky in my days!",1297555200,8,1546,4.398601398601398
3258012,5,B000Y9XFW2,"I ordered this core DVD after already completing the 8 week challenge from Lindsay Brin's Bootcamp 2 DVD. I would have to say that if I hadn't already worked my core with the bootcamp dvd I don't think I could have gotten through one of these core workouts. They are very difficult but also very effective. I love that she works your core from every angle imaginable, no endless crunches here! There are different workout options to choose from and the Pilates and Yoga segment are some of the most challenging I have ever done (and I've done a lot of Pilates vids in the past). I honestly can't say enough good things about any of Lindsay's videos. Yes, they may not be the flashiest or have the greatest music but they WORK and isn't that what a workout video is really supposed to do? Her videos are the first that I have actually been motivated enough to commit to doing EVERY day because I see results. I would recommend them to anyone.

3258014,5,B000Y9XFW2,"So many other workouts tell you that just by doing crunches you are working your core and you will get amazing abs. But Lindsay teaches you how to use your inner core--the transverse abdominus--which is much more challenging than just working the surface muscles of the abs. This is a very challenging workout! The yoga section kills me everytime. I LOVE it! Lindsay shows a wide vareity of exercises that target the core, which is great so you don't get bored of just doing the same old crunches over and over again. I used this in addition to Boot Camp 2 after my first baby, and believe me, it helps get your core solid and strong again (which at first felt like it would be impossible with how stretched out and weak my abs felt after having my baby, even with working out throughout my pregnancy). It's kind of shocking what pregnancy does to your abs, but take hope in knowing that you can get fabulous abs again if you learn how to work your core the right way! Lindsay will teach you how! She positive and energetic and fun to work out ""with"". :) And she uses real moms in all of her videos (including herself) who have been through the same struggle of getting a great looking body back that we have to go through, too! I am so glad that we finally have a fitness professional willing to teach the real secret to great abs to all of us!",1272412800,4,1345,4.341269841269841

She is also very good at explaining exercises, and the whys and hows of finding your core again.  Lindsay is also a great motivator, and I do not find her annoying like other video personalities.  But most importantly does it work?!?  YES it does! Lindsay has gotten me into great shape after three babes.  My core is strong now than it was before my last baby.

And you get your heart rate up as well, so no need to add on a cardio workout, its all in there! I really felt that my abs got much stronger.

So much for being in excellent shape - I barely made it through half the sets!  After two months, though, I had abs like I was 16, not the mom of 6, and I was throwing my kids all over the place in the pool, too.  Seriously, it felt like living a before and after info-mercial that all took place in less than 3 months!  Some of her terms are a little corny - but I'll take that in a heartbeat compared to the swearing on some of the hard-core DVDs, especially with lots of kids trying to work-out alongside me.  She's done her research and knows which muscles go AWOL on moms during pregnancy, and she knows how to kick it all back into gear.  Well worth buying!",1269993600,24,808,4.180645161290323

Lindsay is no joke! Her workouts were pretty hard at first for someone like me who is 35 and a mother of three.  I'd even thought I was in pretty good physical shape until I tried this.  I do believe that by the time I am doing a complete 30 to 45 min. workout with her I will see more results.  So far I can feel the results in my abs. I'm a petite person but 3 babies stretched my belly and when I coughed 2 wks ago it would hurt, (that's how weak my muscles had become) but not anymore. My only criticism of this video is that sometimes she switches right into other moves a little too quickly and without proper  demonstation.

It took me forever to work up to doing all of the exercises but once I did, my core strength was back and my stomach flattened. Honestly, it still took me about 5-6 months after my c-section to get my stomach back to pre-baby size even with crazy amounts of cardio and this dvd 4-5x's/week.. I think it would have gone a lot faster had I had a normal delivery but alas..

I just picked this video back up again after a year of doing other fitness activities and it STILL kicks my butt even now. That's definitely a sign of a good fitness video :)
