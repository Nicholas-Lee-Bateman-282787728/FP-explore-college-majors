5696389,4,B00C7MW5TI,"I don't have a problem with LAND OF THE LOST being that I only know the show by name having never seen even a nanosecond of it. The movie, though,  is passable but not one of Will Ferrell's better movies. Danny McBride is the highlight of the flick. Something tells me there was a funnier and weirder movie left on the cutting room floor. As for MACGRUBER, well here's the thing: if you love or simply understand the tropes of over the top cheesy 80s action movies then this movie will speak to you. Sure it's based on ridiculous SNL skits (with most of them lasting no more than 90 seconds) but the film is a spot-on spoof of that genre. I think it's blazingly funny, crude, rude, immature and criminally underrated. Will Forte has a wickedly dry sense of humor and delivery that I have always enjoyed and is used greatly in this movie. Thankfully, 4 years after its theatrical release (where it made like no money at all) the movie has been making some rumblings and has been slowly turning into a cult film (thedissolve.com has a GREAT piece on the flick). It's a flick worth checking out.",1409184000,2,1092,4.46
5696390,5,B00C7MW5TI,"Great combo. Both movies are super funny, and in different ways. MacGruber is so amazingly dumb, crude and obnoxious, all in a great hilarious way. The directing is great and hilarious. Will Forte did a wonderful job. This movie is a serious plot (nuclear disaster is about to happen and Macgruber must save the world), but the insane comedy that is presented, I found very funny. Ryan Phillips keeps you tied to the more serious part of the movie, and Kirsten Wagg does a great balancing act, while being funny in many different situations. I'd honestly watch MacGruber 2. Land of the lost starring Will Ferrell and Danny McBride is a better overall movie, in that it has a better story line you could say. This one isn't as absurd or ""insane"" as MacGruber. Still it is super hilarious, seems like such a normal movie yet it has this overall craziness intertwined with the comedic genius of Ferrell and McBride. I enjoyed both movies very much. Good laughs.",1408924800,2,958,4.708333333333333

5696404,4,B00C7MW5TI,"LET IT BE KNOWN: The four star rating is for the criminally under-seen/ under-appreciated 'MacGruber.' It's funny, dark, weird, and it WORKS. The love that Will Forte and Jorma Taccome have for over-earnest 80's action films is obvious.

I'm treating 'Land Of The Lost' as a special feature that's best viewed once and mostly forgotten (in it's favor: there are 2.5 laughs in the movie, and Anna Friel is dependably charming).",1409875200,,426,5.0

8578313,1,B00C7MW5TI,"One of the movies works just fine, the other however only plays the trailers. How does that even work? How can it only play the trailers and then freeze when it gets to the part I actually paid to watch? I made multiple attempts, none of them had any different outcomes. Flawless movie trailer performance, zero actual movie performance.",1482969600,,337,4.728813559322034
