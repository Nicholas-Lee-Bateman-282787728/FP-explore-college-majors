4498436,5,B004XYABQ2,This is an excellent series with a good balance of details on the cars and interviews with those who know and/or own them. Just about every American Muscle Car from the classic 1960s and shortly after is covered in an informative and entertaining way. The breaks to fit in commercials on TV are a bit annoying - and the segments between breaks are rather short. But overall it's a great series.,1365292800,,394,4.563380281690141
4498437,5,B004XYABQ2,"I found the packaging right for the DVDs. The 1970 LS6 Chevelle on the cover fits the DVD Box set perfect. I have seen all the episodes before buying the DVDs. I think if you love Muscle Cars then this is a must for you. Each Episode specialize in a certain model, and shows the history of the model including who was responsible for their creation. A lot of good interviews with noted designers, muscle car restores, and owners of the cars. I would recommend this DVD. A thumbs up! :):):)",1364947200,,489,4.384615384615385
4498438,5,B004XYABQ2,"If you're interested in muscle cars or classic American cars, this 6-disc DVD set is for you! GTO's, 442's, Chevelles, Mustangs, Chargers, and more! Lots of burning rubber and throaty exhaust growls!

This is the first three seasons of ""American Muscle Car"" - a series on SPEED channel and consists of 15 1/2 hours (Fifteen and a half hours of muscle cars! WOW!) of material on 6 discs. Each segment highlights a specific car or topic and is roughly 25 minutes long (the length of a 1/2-hour TV show without commercials). Each one focuses on a car's history, changes to the model over time, the engines, transmissions, options, etc. Each segment has excellent period video plus that of restored models. Lots of good views of all the cars, interiors and under hoods.

This is a well-produced video series with good cinematography, decent soundtrack, interviews with experts, owners of restored cars and even some with men who designed or engineered these beauties! This is a good series that is fun to watch for the car buff - you will not be bored!

Though most segments are about an individual model of car, some are about racing teams such as the ""Ramchargers"" or about the Hurst company, their contributions to racing and the special edition ""Hurst"" cars that were built. There were a few episodes that weren't ""muscle cars"" per se such as segments on the '55-57 Chevrolet Bel Air, the lettered Chrysler 300's and the Corvette...but I didn't mind and I don't think most viewers will either!

This was a fun series and very enjoyable. There were segments on lesser known muscle cars such as the AMC ""AMX"" and the Dodge Dart GT and GTS as well as cars such as the Buick Regal GNX and Pontiac Super Duty Trans Am's that appeared after the muscle car era ended.

This is a good, well-made, entertaining series that the car buff will like. Not only that, but you get 15 1/2 hours of cars for a little over $20! A great price for all you get! This is a must-have! Five stars!",1359072000,10,1972,4.622857142857143
4498439,5,B004XYABQ2,"I'm a student mechanic and I didn't live through the muscle car era. I bought this as a history class of some sort. I don't regret it! This set shows the history of every muscle car model plus engine specifications, torque, compression ratios, etc. It also talks about the car makers logic as to why they came up with the ideas (basically the biggest engine wins). I found very neat that you can go straight from the menu to the car you want to know more about. It compiles the best cars of that era starting with the GTO, COPO, Hemi Cuda, Chevelle, Camaro, Mustang, Nova, Olds 442, Buick GS, Corvette and even the Viper. It takes you back to the muscle car era that I didn't live and some will love to go back to. I'm glad I bought it and now I know what old timers talk about. If you are thinking of buying it and you are not sure, take my honest word as advice and don't waste time. Buy it! Also, this makes a great gift for any car enthusiast so plan to buy more than one.",1357430400,3,976,4.115183246073299

4498442,5,B004XYABQ2,"I had purchased this set for my husband, just because I believe he needed a pick me up. When he received it in the mail, he was surprised, not only for the gift, but what the gift was. My husband loves everything about Muscle Cars. He really enjoyed watching these DVD's and learning all the neat features and abundance of information they give on each vehicle. The one thing he really liked was that you could put the DVD in and pick which specific car you wanted to hear about from the menu. Totally awesome set. Ladies you can't go wrong with this set. Money well spent.",1330387200,22,573,4.364485981308412

 DVDs are packed with not only great videos of muscle cars from the days but you'll also get great commentary about the history of those great cars. Someone complained about the videos being too loud, well I don't agree and what the heck these are muscle cars what would you expect? I only have one complaint and that would be I wish there were more videos of those classics.",1439683200,2,445,4.426829268292683

4498458,4,B004XYABQ2,"These videos are presented very professionally and are very interesting.  However, I would have been more interested in shows about the more common Muscle Cars.  Not everyone could buy a Chevelle SS 454.  BUT, they could buy an SS 396 or 350.  The 427 Fords, 428 and 429 Cobra Jet engines, 426 Hemis, and the 454 Chevys were not high sellers.  People bought the Chevy small block 350, the Ford 289, the Mopar 383 or 440 and so on.  These were the Muscle Car of the average buyer.",1398816000,5,479,4.386363636363637
4498459,4,B004XYABQ2,They really go in to the history behind all these classic cars.  The one down side is there are no special features or extras of any kind on the DVDs.,1394236800,,150,4.0

4498461,5,B004XYABQ2,"This is a great series which highlights nearly all the American manufacturers and their muscle car models of the late 60's and early 70's accompanied by surfer style music from the same time period.
