7907998,5,B00000F9ZB,My son loves watching this video.  He has also learned a few words in sign language.  Great pictures of animals and vocabulary words to go with them.,1383004800,,149,4.481481481481482
7907999,5,B00000F9ZB,"I have purchased 5 sets of Baby See 'n Sign Volumes I & II over the past 5 years. Three of the sets have been for my two grandsons and one for our home and the other two sets as gifts.

My five year old grandson knew all the signs by the time he was two and we expect that our 6 month old grandson will begin learning them soon. While the five year old was learning signing, we were too, including his parents, his uncle and we grandparents.

My son-in-law has two nephews (ages 6 & 3)who were born deaf and even though they both have cochlear implants having some knowledge of signing improved the entire family's ability to communicate.

I highly recommend these videos as a daily exercise in educating your child and you.",1280620800,,724,4.3088235294117645
7908000,4,B00000F9ZB,I borrowed this dvd from the library first and after viewing with my children decided we needed our own copy. I like the fact that the teacher is a native signer having signed from an early age with her parents and she also teaches sign as her profession. I also like the repetion of each sign three times very helpful for both parents and children - especially the slowed down version.,1197936000,,386,4.450704225352113
7908001,5,B00000F9ZB,"I got this for our 5-month old, who is now 17 months old.  In the beginning, I left it on as background noise.  One day, my son said ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapple.""  He definitely picked that up from is dvd.  He knew how to identify many objects because of the dvd.  We have volume 1 too and at 17-months old, he's mastered 90% of the signs in vol. 1 and about 50% of the signs in vol. 2.  He selects what he likes to identify and learns the signs and words.  In our case, signing definitely helped him start speaking early rather than delaying his speech development.",1150588800,,562,4.346153846153846
7908002,1,B00000F9ZB,"I purchased this for my 15 month old daughter who has been really enthusiastically watching and learning Baby Babble and My Baby Can Talk dvds from age 7 months. From the positive reviews I expected this to be very good. If you like a much faster pace with loads of content, this is for you. My daughter lost interest very quickly. I managed to watch the entire dvd and throughout felt quite nauseas from watching the quick changing scenes. The effects of repeatedly ""flipping pages"" was in my opinion, the cause. To me, this production is like reading a book (without breathing) filled with pages of continuous black text, with little or no thought for layout. I would not recommend this to my friends but will recommend the SIGNING TIME series. It's content may not be as full as the Baby See N Sign but it is definitely a more effective way of teaching making learning easy and fun. Also, the technique, production quality, songs and relevance cannot be beaten.",1147910400,5,964,4.676470588235294
7908003,5,B00000F9ZB,"I'm the mother of a 6 month old.  We just received our Baby See 'N Sign DVDs Volumes I & II.  Not only is the menu very user-friendly, but between the 2 volumes they cover over 200 signs!  The signs are repeated 3 times (once in slow-motion) for slow learners like me!  The set is loaded with objects, sounds and picture after picture of little ones!  These DVDs  cover more signs than any others I have looked at.  I really like how the signs are presented, not just for me, but for my baby too.  She is captured by the sights and sounds and signs!  I can't wait till she starts signing with me! I can tell she is learning as she watches!",1145577600,,639,4.130081300813008
7908004,3,B00000F9ZB,"This DVD, although filled with good information, seems like it was copied from VHS and not encoded specifically for DVD. By that I mean that there is no menu to choose from so if you want to see only a few of the signs (There are a ton of them) you have no choice but to either fast forward or wait it out. Not nearly as entertaining as others we have but as I mentioned, there are alot of useful signs.",1132963200,,403,3.9876543209876543
7908005,5,B00000F9ZB,LOVE both Volume 1 and 2!  Used Vol 1 with our now 4 yr old with great success.  Now am using both volumes with our 8-mo old.  And the 4yr even sits down with his baby brother and tries to teach him the signs when the DVDs are playing.  Highly recommend both!!!,1123545600,,261,3.9615384615384617
7908006,5,B00000F9ZB,"Loved the first one so much I had to get this one!  Very good series and easy to teach and easy to learn.  Won a Parent's Choice Award, now I know why!",1122249600,,151,3.6875
