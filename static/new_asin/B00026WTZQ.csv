2064209,2,B00026WTZQ,"Starring Hamilton 'Ham' Porter from Sandlot, Topanga from Boy Meets World, Tatyana Ali from Fresh Prince, the Sherminator from the American Pie films, and the guy from Can't Buy Me Love who got a bag of poo thrown on his porch, Dorm Daze is a goofy mish-mash of the typical ""eliminate virginity"" plot and a overly complicated case of mistaken identity - a case that mixes-up a French foreign exchange student and a hooker.  What's the difference, right?  The mix-ups are really elementary.  Same phone on the same table.  Identical handbags.  Dropped notes picked up by the wrong people.  At times it all feels like a Benny Hill skit.

In the end, it's too shallow and too long.  Way too long.",1318636800,,693,4.669421487603306

2064211,4,B00026WTZQ,"Taken at face value, Dorm Daze is an Exagerated view of dorm life for college kids, with its relationships, love triagles, and the problems/gossip that occur while sharing living quarters with so many people.  Initially starting out as a movie following one brother's attempt to get his younger brother ""some Action"" by purchasing a prostitute, it soon becomes one involving mixed up identities and a good bunch of money. Along the way many characters are introduced, the nerdy girl, the nerdy guy who secretly love the nerdy girl...who is hot, the young couple that has goes through a relationship crisis, the gossipy girls that spred rumors and jump to conclusions...you get the point. But the writers did do a fairly good job at pulling all of these characters together into one plot that did have some cohesion to it, and actually was quite funny at how things got blown out of proportions.  A good comedy rental, or buy it for cheap here on amazon since rentals cost so much any more.

CAUTION, they have now released Dorm Daze 2, which makes this movie look like a masterpiece compared to it.",1161129600,,1098,4.768421052631579
2064212,1,B00026WTZQ,"Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once.",1153267200,5,125,5.2
2064213,3,B00026WTZQ,"Dorm Daze really isn't all that bad; it's a good movie to watch with your friends so you can be more immature than usual. It's actually very funny but some of it is a waste of time. Let's face it because this movie is really another teen movie and a mediocre one from the great National Lampoons and it seems like a step down for them. The film is really made off the cast who do a good job at being stupid and if not for them this movie is a lost cause. It's filled with lust, some fights, mystery, and scandal so if you like that you'll love this.

I'm glad I grew up knowing that the kid actors you loved during your childhood grew up too. You have Patrick Renna from The much loved classic Sandlot and Big Green and what's really funny is that he kind of resembles his character in Sandlot but more grown up with a dirtier mouth. Then you have the beautiful Tatyana Ali from The Fresh prince, even though this isn't the first movie I've seen with the two of them acting like this it's by far the worst.

Anyway who cares about that since these two are the stand out actors, Patrick is a lot funnier than I expected and it's his antics that set the mood for the movie. Dorm Daze is better than expected and the reason why I can't give a little bit of a spoiler is because this stuff is not something you can say here. Most likely you can catch this on cable so look out for it.",1147046400,8,1380,4.088560885608856
2064214,5,B00026WTZQ,"It doesn't surprise me that not many people have ever heard about this movie, or have any idea it even exists. I myself didn't even know the movie existed until watching it at a friend's house one day. And boy am I glad I watched it that day, because this is definitely a worthy addition to an comedy fans collection. What surprises me more is that like some other great movies out there (100 Girls, Jailbait), this one was a straight to DVD port, despite having an excellent cast of characters including Patrick Renna (Ham from The Sandlot), Danielle Fischell (Topanga from Boys Meets World), Chris Owen (Sherminator from American Pie), James Debello (Rod from 100 Girls, Trip from Detroit Rock City), and Tatyana Ali (Ashley from Fresh Prince of Bellair). The movie, while not mature or deep in any sense, definitely does it's job of giving the viewer a pleasurable experience, and for that should not be overlooked.

The plot focuses around Styles (Patrick Renna) who is insisting his brother Booker (Chris Owen) lose his virginity (hey I said the plot wasn't very mature). To ensure Booker gets the job done, Styles hires a Hooker to come take care of business. Unfortunately the Hooker, Dominique, gets mixed up with a foreign exchange student arriving at the same time, letting the fun begin. Throw in an arguement between Claire (Tatyana Ali) and her boyfriend Tony (Edwin Hodge) over a misinterpreted play rehearsal, and a purse filled with money, and you can almost guess where the movie is going. I won't reveal anymore of the plot just incase you haven't seen it, but trust me the hiliarity of the cast, the jokes and the overall storyline combine for a generally pleasurable time, making this movie a must see for fans of films along the lines of ""American Pie"" or ""Girl Next Door"".

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies with sometimes juvenile humor, but with an overall entertaining message. Taking the movie too seriously will inhibit the viewing experience, so just look at it as something to entertain you, not something to be deep or life changing (because trust me it's far from that). Many have trashed the movie because of it's crude jokes and young cast, but that's what really makes the movie worth seeing. Don't make the mistake of writing this movie off without at least giving it a chance. I guarantee if you don't take it too seriously you might find yourself enjoying this one quite a bit.",1127952000,9,2438,4.761229314420804
2064215,4,B00026WTZQ,Everybody is running around like a chicken with their heads cut off tring to fine the bag one bag is filled with money and one is just a regular grandmothers bag which that black guy lost. Their are two hookers in theis movie claiming their French. A nerd guy want the French girl to eat his French sausage he realy can't see with out his glasses. A boy who is a virgin is being hooked up by his brother to have sex with a hooker in the end he reviled that he was a virgin to.,1123804800,2,476,3.96875
2064216,4,B00026WTZQ,"This is NOT Shakespeare. It is not even loosely based on any of Shakespeare's comedies. Still, I could not help but see a little bit of the Elizabethan bard in this farcial comedy. Bits from ""As You Like It"" and ""A Comedy of Errors"", not two of his masterpieces by any stretch of the imagination, come most readily to mind.

Basically, this is a farce based upon mistaken idenitity. The venue is a college dorm. A French foreign exchange student named Dominique is confused with a hooker named Dominique. Also confusing is a coed named Brittany confused with nefarious woman with a shady background named Brittany. At stake is a lot of testosterone and a purse full of money that happens to resemble someone else's purse devoid of money.

This is a slapstick style comedy that relies of physical sight gags, and a sophomoric sense of humor. That does not mean it cannot be enjoyed, just don't expect a product of the calibur of Vacation or Animal House. Turn off your mind, sit back and enjoy the silly hijinks.",1115942400,2,1011,4.64245810055866
2064217,3,B00026WTZQ,"National Lampoon has been known throughout. the years for their slapstick comedies, and while this movie does not rank with the vacation movies, it is quite funny. Dont rent or buy this movie expecting a witty comedy, because the name ""National Lampoon's Dorm Daze"" should be enough to clue you in on the content. It is a rather typical college movie complete with a clumbsy geek, and quite a few topless moments, a great movie to watch with your buddies, and have a few laughs. I rated this movie a 3 but would have rather rated a 3.5.",1114041600,3,536,4.479591836734694
2064218,5,B00026WTZQ,"Ok, it's not Animal House - it's tough to beat the original. It's also not the Vacation Series, but it's still NL and kudos to their casting people.  It's a college flic, sophomoric humor and it's escapism, not reality.  That's the whole point of the movies - to escape from reality - why do we want to pay to see reality on the screen when we live it everyday. I gave it 5 stars for the simple fact that it was great to see Danielle Fishel in something a bit racy for change and she handled it well.",1101772800,2,500,4.091836734693878
2064219,1,B00026WTZQ,"Remember the good old days of ""ANIMAL HOUSE"", ""VACATION"" and maybe even ""LOADED WEAPON""...well their OVER!!!!!
(...)
This movie is a JOKE, i laughed so much on how this movie was NOT FUNNY, and this time...i won't blame it on the actors, the acting was actually quite good, but the script they had to work with unfortunetly wasn't.
Short summary of the film, everyone misunderstands each other in this dorm and things go crazy after that, there's a foreign exchange student, a gay guy, a nerd, a hooker, a hitman, a pretty girl, a basketball player with a jealous girlfriend, two tramps who like to gossip about everything, a punk guy who's supposed to be french but he's not, a nice guy who has a crazy roomate who torments him all the time, and..well does it really matter?
Confused? Watch the film, you'll understand what i mean...or better yet, DON'T!! (...)

2064220,1,B00026WTZQ,"The only thing worth seeing is a single Pam Anderson scene. The virgin's brother is locked in the closet and he dreams himself as Hef. That's all there is. Snore snore, grit grit.",1100649600,2,179,4.454545454545454
2064221,5,B00026WTZQ,"Five stars!  No questions asked.  Only National Lampoon can have you rolling in the aisle with such dumb silliness.  ""Dorm Daze"" had me in a daze.  It is so lame, it is funny.  The script is excellent and the casting is perfect.  The best word to describe it is ""zany"".  What makes all of the National Lampoon films work is the editing.  The cutting from one scene to the next...from one dorm room to the next...was excellent.  It reminded me of a modern day Marx Bros. in a college setting...very much like ""Room Service"" (a classic).  I expected a no-brainer.  I got a no-brainer with brains!  I can see why other critics may not like it.  You thoroughly have to enjoy silliness to appreciate ""Dorm Daze""...but if you've ever lived in a dorm, it is so ""right on"" in parts.  Wanna good laugh?  Be sure you pause the film if you leave the room.  You don't want to miss a single clip...and it jumps around so much it would be easy to do so.  Great comedy.  A National Lampoon classic!",1100476800,8,983,4.366666666666666

2064223,2,B00026WTZQ,"This is definitely not one of the best National Lampoon movies.  It takes place in a college dorm filled with your stereotypical sexually charged males and airhead females.  One of the male students hires a prostitute, named Dominique.  However, she quickly becomes confused with a French foreign exchange student, also named Dominique.  This does draw a few laugh out loud moments.  However, most of the film is spent showing the characters chasing each other through the dorm, looking for a purse full of money.  Where the money came from is never adequately  explained.  All we know is it was the result of some crooked operation.  After the first hour, you just wish the movie would come to an end.  But it drags on for another 35 minutes.  The only person who made this movie tolerable was Boti Bliss as Dominique (the prostitute).  She is a beautiful women.  And she does have a partial nude scene in the film.",1094083200,3,916,4.7215189873417724
2064224,1,B00026WTZQ,"This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time.  The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disapoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy.  Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT.  Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.",1093824000,2,368,4.304347826086956
2064225,1,B00026WTZQ,"This movie is so weak it is not even funny.  One star is way to high for this sad, pitiful thing that calls itself a comedy.  If a negative rating was possible, I would have given it a negative ten!  This is NOWHERE in the same league as ""Animal House"" and ""Vacation.""  Come on National Lampoon.  Spend some money and hire some real writers and directors!!!!!!",1092960000,2,360,4.393939393939394
2064226,3,B00026WTZQ,"This movie is unique among teen/college sex comedies in that it has a story arc other than ""setup, show naked woman, roll credits.""  It's a farce with more crossed wires and misunderstandings than an entire season of Frasier, and I was entertained by the twists and turns and some hilarious one-liners.

It could have been a little (15-25 min) shorter, which would have simplified the plot a little bit.  Also, it was seriously overdirected...there were some corny sound effects and unnecessary swooping camera.  Still, if you can see through some of those flaws, you've got one of the best written teen movies since modern teen standard-setter American Pie.

I will say this: Infinitely better than Van Wilder.",1092528000,3,711,5.042735042735043

2064228,1,B00026WTZQ,"Don't listen to these Danielle Fishel fanboys (and they must be, since she has about fifteen minutes of total screen time in this movie).  This was the single worst movie of the 21st century.  How else to describe a comedy of about 1 hour and 45 minutes where I did not even smile once?  No big surprise, as National Lampoon seems to have no shame in putting its once respectable brand name on crap!  What is far worse than the movie's complete lack of humor is the blatantly false advertising.  Looking at the packaging and even the menu screens on this supposedly ""unrated"" DVD, you are led to believe that this movie is going to be non-stop sex and nudity.  Well, guess again.  There is NO SEX and two very BRIEF scenes which I will describe here so you can save your money:  In one scene, a male character has a one minute fantasy sequence where former Playmate Katie Lohmann appears topless and engages in the most chaste kiss you can imagine with another actress for about two seconds.  The other scene is with this same male character where a woman pretending to be a hooker does a strip tease.  Just when she takes off her bra, there is a cut to an obvious body double taking off her bra and exposing her goods!  The actress who plays the hooker has the porno-esque name of Boti Bliss, yet this nobody is too good to take off her top in a movie?! This was laughable.  So, do you think any of that rates an R, much less an ""UNRATED""?  Save your money, folks.",1092268800,11,1465,4.341911764705882
