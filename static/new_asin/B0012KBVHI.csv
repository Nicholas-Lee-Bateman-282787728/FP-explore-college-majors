3090757,3,B0012KBVHI,"I was somewhat disappointed with this dvd.  My cats are interested but not too excited.  Doesn't seem o hold there interest for long.  Not a total loss though, it is better to have something that keeps them entertained for a little while than nothing at all.  Though I must say I only put it on while I am at work so they may be enthralled all day long and I am just missing it.  If you have cats, and they are bored, it is worth a shot.",1254873600,3,437,3.9770114942528734
3090758,5,B0012KBVHI,My cats watch their dvd with visual and sound effect all day. They feel at home especially with the bird sounds..it seems to calm them.  My older cat Bo gets really close to the screen to watch the fish swim  by. This is a great product that you should buy for your cats entertainment.,1241568000,4,285,4.2592592592592595
3090759,3,B0012KBVHI,"Ok, so maybe my cat has a little A.D.D., but some days she likes the video and some days she ignores it completely.  I agree with the producer that you really need to leave this on when you are not at home - possibly due to other distractions our presence has, but when my cat gets ""into"" it, she can watch it for quite a while.

I recommend this for people who are away from home alot, but still care for the mental care of their cats.  If you can pick it up on sale, I would say it is a nice addition to have.

This version has mostly fish tank scenes.  There are some ""teaser"" loops for other videos which my cat seems like more than the aquariums - so maybe I just picked the wrong version for my cat. Nice aspect is that whatever scenes you choose, they automatically loop over and over, so it can draw the cats attention for quite a while.",1237334400,3,845,4.066265060240964
3090760,5,B0012KBVHI,"I have a new kitten and thought I'd just buy this DVD for fun to see what she would do.  I was pleasantly surprised to see ""Sunny"" watch the DVD from the rocker.  I even put a chair by the TV and she jumps up and really does like to paw at the fish on screen.  I've got photos.... it's really fun to watch her.  Beautiful Clear DVD.  I turn the sound down sometimes as personally it's a bit much but leave the DVD looping.  The fish are beautiful and even my husband is amused.  It's like having a Fish Tank without all the work!  Also includes other options like Mice, Bird Feeders and Gerbils.  Personally I Enjoy the Fish Tank.  I'm Actually Buying a Few for Christmas Gifts as my kids have Cats.

3090762,4,B0012KBVHI,"I liked this video because it offered two good choices,  either the fish tank (""Gone Fishing"") mixed with the digital catnip scenes or the looped video tracks of Cat Sitter Vol. 1 Greatest Hits.

3090763,5,B0012KBVHI,"My grandkittens go nuts for this video.  Make sure your TV is firmly mounted as the cats tried to attack the screen.  If you have an older TV, you might want to hook a DVD up to it rather than having them scratch the screen on your big screen TV.",1357776000,,246,3.9

One of my cats will then jump up onto the TV stand and try to ""paw"" at the fish as if trying to catch it.  I often wonder when he will 'figure it out' that he is pawing at the TV screen, but somehow he never seems to quite realize that the fish are not there.  I now feel a lot less guilty about going out and leaving them home alone in a silent house... :(  The other two Cat Sitter DVD are just as good, but for some reason this one with the fish, they particularly like.

But I thought what the heck maybe there is something special about these videos.  Having two young kittens (6 months) I thought perhaps I would find the video kept them occupied for maybe a few minutes.  Not so!  The only thing they paid any attention to was the short video showing DA BIRD in use. They have DA BIRD and recognized it.  Otherwise they could have cared less.,1304121600,,476,4.2444444444444445
