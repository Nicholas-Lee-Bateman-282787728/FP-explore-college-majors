5955842,5,B00EYA6VGY,Cosby... Still  on top. No one can spin a yarn like the Coz. He is the Master!  You will really enjoy this. I look forward to many more of these from the true king of comedy.  I immediately ordered the DVD after watching on Comedy Central,1385251200,6,238,4.130434782608695
5955843,5,B00EYA6VGY,"An unforgettable performance , Cosby is truly the master of putting ever day life in perspective. You have to love this  man. And no profanity , a performer who doesn't need profanity to shore up his or her weak material.",1385251200,50,221,4.525
5955844,5,B00EYA6VGY,"My husband and I were fortunate enough to be at the taping of this show, and it was a magical night! We were looking forward to watching it on Comedy Central (we laughed all over again), and now seeing that there is an hour of extra footage on the DVD, I am ordering it too--because I know the funny stuff that wasn't shown on TV. Plus we saw actors who have worked with Mr. Cosby being interviewed in the lobby, so I'm thinking we may see that on the DVD as well.

This is Bill Cosby at his finest (is there any other way?). Even if you watched the special, buy this! It will make everyone laugh.",1385251200,30,597,4.102564102564102
5955845,5,B00EYA6VGY,"I was so glad to see this on Comedy Central.  Although I don't eschew the top comedians on their rosters (Daniel Tosh comes to mind) Cosby's style and delivery of genuine universal truths render side splitting laughter--without hate, discrimination, cursing, drug references or celebration of the inane or morally corrupt. Although it centered on mature themes from the perspective of a long married man, it was totally appropriate for a three year old to a 93 watching it.  I laughed a lot during the middle when he talked about marital relationships.  Funny!!!  Kudos to Mr Cosby for putting together an act a human being can watch and feel better afterward for having his spirit lifted and his character not degraded by the ""jokes"" of mainstream comedians today.",1385164800,71,765,5.0
5955846,5,B00EYA6VGY,"How the prior reviewer can say he wasn't a fan of Cosby before until this special on Comedy Central is strange. This special was true and classic Cosby. Must have been referencing Mr. Cosby's cultural views which are 100% true.

This special though is true Cosby at his very best. Saw him in Greenville, NC and it was one of the highlights of my life.",1385164800,,351,4.4

5955851,3,B00EYA6VGY,"Made in 2013. Talks about how fantastic a girlfriend is, but a wife takes everything. In the extras an interview about his legacy. Fans laugh throughout the performance and in the extras several comment upon the greatness that is Cosby. I wonder what they think now. He wants to meet the film students that worked on the project and eagerly shakes their hands. I wonder if he (allegedly) came onto any of them. Unknown.",1457568000,,419,4.675675675675675

Only in Hollywood do terrible people get away with unthinkable things

you can buy and sell people which is very sad
Let's celebrate a massive s#x offender
Bill Cosby as a human being is a massive hypocrite and a phony
He'd go after dirty comedians like Eddie Murphy, Andrew Dice Clay, Sam Kinison,  etc.
with the laundry list of woman who have come out of the wood work it's easy to see the man is just horrible and a real life monster
Just because he played a role as the perfect dad on tv doesn't mean much!
his legacy should no longer be celebrate or even talked about he is grade a trash
Anyone with a mother, wife, sister or daughter should not defend or even try to explain his actions

The DVD stops at ""I Didn't Ask to be Born"". I think for the price I paid, they should have been included - they were very funny.",1438819200,3,431,3.954022988505747

As he has aged a bit, some items do not come out well and would be suited to a younger performer.

Bill Cosby can get away with his comments on aging because he is a member of that group; but some may find his comments on aging and marriage offensive.

This movie is not fun to watch with your spouse. While sometimes funny, it's really a LONG rant about how women drive men crazy when they are old and the kids are gone. Maybe I will find it funny when I'm older, but not so much now. Maybe I just don't get it yet.

In ""Bill Cosby, Himself"", you knew he loved the kids but they still drove him nuts. This time, it seems like he's just angry and irritable.",1404432000,7,621,4.040650406504065

Why do you sell products in EU when they can't be used? DVDs from other zones that can't be seen in EU?

The DVD sold to me, ordered from EU, can't be played in EU. So why do you sell it to EU customers?

The stories in this set reminded me so much of my parents it was crazy. It just goes to show that part of what makes things funny is that so many people can understand and relate to the stories and emotions. It's been a while since I had seen Cosby's standup and it's definitely more of a slow storytelling kind of comedy than I remember - he's not as young as he used to be after all - but the stories are still hilarious and relatable.

5955980,3,B00EYA6VGY,"Let me say from the start, Bill Cosby has been my FAVORITE comedian for several decades. I have always appreciated his ability to deliver humor cleanly and making it relate to everyone. His ability to interact with the audience and deliver perfect timing has definitely not diminished with his age.

However, this performance was so focused on the negative aspects of his marriage that I found the material to get cumbersome about 1/2 way through. By the end of the performance, I actually felt sorry for him that his marriage was obviously a burden and sorry for his wife who became the brunt of his jokes.

I hope that he continues to perform. Hopefully future pieces will not be so inclusive on negativity. Come on Bill .. we laugh because you laugh .. find some joy in your life please!",1393113600,3,790,4.635714285714286

THIS IS GOOD, CLEAN FUNNY HUMOR AT ITS BEST! The only thing I found out was that this version is one of two tapings that he did and the one I taped is a little different. This version that I bought  is the same material with a few more stories, so this version is a wee bit longer. Nice going, whoever is to be thanked!",1392681600,,648,3.946564885496183

My Grandparents watched it immediately and LOVED it and told us we HAD to borrow it to see it in its entirety! We had a whole evening of laughs. Bill Cosby truly is far from finished... He is as funny as ever and hits the topic of marriage in way that you can't help but laugh, shake your head and agree! I highly recommend this!!",1389744000,,472,4.086021505376344

The interview in the Bonus material is even more precious than the show.
In it, Cosby tells us how he creates his on-stage magic. It gives us an intimate, inside view of how he thinks, and the true Bill Cosby... In my mind, a saint. Without the laughter he generates whenever I see his performances, old or new, my life would have been a depressing challenge... with laughter, I can get through almost anything.
Cosby is one of the all time great comics...

They said it didn't work on their DVD player which was very upsetting to me. I had also ordered a double DVD collection of Jeff Dunham the ventriloquist for my sister and her husband who were at my folks' house for the holidays. Those DVD's worked fine. I don't know if you sent a DVD that wasn't compatible with the North American region of DVD players but this was the very first time I ever utilized shopping online with Amazon.com and don't know if I'll chance doing it again. Like they say, the first impression is the most important! It's not worth the trouble of having my parents spend their money on any shipping fees back to me or Amazon.com. My sister took the DVD to try on her own player to see if it works.

He's about Cosby's age and I suspected he'd like the jokes on family and marriage. Bill even makes the inevitability of death funny!  Cosby keeps the subject matter and language clean so every generation can enjoy it together.  Keeping it classy doesn't make it less funny, on the contrary it makes it more so with Cosby's relaxed style and facial expressions. You can't teach this kind of charm.  Bill is a hilarious class act.",1388880000,,560,4.606060606060606

5956046,5,B00EYA6VGY,"Without one word that has to be bleeped, Cosby simply sits on a stool and offers a routine of observations on the difference between dating and marriage, on life with kids and other observations about family life that leave the audience laughing continually while nodding their heads at how each observation rings true.",1388793600,,319,5.037735849056604

Yes, this show is mainly about wife jokes, but there is a lot of truth in what he is saying and all except one woman who watched it with us found it hilarious.  He ability to convey a message with just facial expressions and mime is outstanding.  I highly recommend it and forget the reviews that complain about the wife jokes.

In general, Bill Cosbys performance is masterful and hilarious.  Everyone recognizes the lifes experiences which he recounts in the way only Bill Cosby can do.  Without the now ever-present use of profanity by modern-day comedians, Bill Cosbys performance and accompanying mimicking are refreshing and welcome.  The only drawback we experienced in watching the DVD, was that viewing the entire performance in one stretch became a bit drawn-out (as little activity takes place on stage.)  Possibly, the viewing joy would be increased by viewing the DVD in slices at a time.",1388620800,,704,5.241071428571429

5956074,5,B00EYA6VGY,Bill Cosby in his unique style takes the everyday that everyone can relate to and gives it his over blown deadpan twist. He has always managed to be talking to his generation while at the same time drawing in those older and younger. I smiled through the whole DVD while never hearing the bassist rant of other comedians.,1387929600,,321,4.551724137931035

5956076,5,B00EYA6VGY,"Firstly, I don't care for most of Bill Cosby's material. But, I loved this opus which deals with relationships and marriage. Anyone who has been involved in a close marital situation will be able to relate to Cosby's take.

It begins with the infatuation phase when a delusional state exists and ""the other"" is viewed quite unrealistically as existing near nirvana. It evolves to reality when (in this case) the husband begins to see his wife as ""she who must be obeyed"" and the constant critic always to be wary of.

He sits throughout the entire monologue though he is quite mobile -- waving his arms and moving his head. His usual slow delivery (which almost always annoys me) works well this time.

This about 90 minute performance is, in truth, a story that works for both men and women. If you have been in a close relationship or married, you will recognize yourself and mate in this brilliant performance.

I originally viewed this on Comedy Central -- but realized that it had been edited. So, I bought it for this reason and also this comedic DVD has so much truth in it -- I wanted to keep it whole for posterity.

Absolutely brilliant. Sometimes telling the truth is dangerous. But Mr. Cosby has a history of having done it dealing with far more sensitive areas than this before.",1387929600,,1291,4.620087336244541
5956077,5,B00EYA6VGY,"To fellow Cos fans, I can say that he's lost nothing. This is a hilarious gig -- he's still got that great timing, in which he takes his time setting up what he's working toward, and then surprises the crowd with the funniest statement when it's least expected. It's insightful, too -- be careful before you decide to get married, fellas!

There's also a 50-minute interview on the DVD. I was really looking forward to this (nearly as much as the special itself), having been an avid listener since finding myself captivated by the Wonderfulness album as a kid. During the interview, Cos says some fascinating things about his start in comedy and his current mindset regarding his overall career. But the interviewer keeps interrupting him, just as he's starting to make his points.

The interviewer is actually the producer, and I'm sure he's a nice guy and does his job well, etc., etc., etc., but he's simply not good at conducting interviews. He begins every single question with ""Let me ask you a question,"" as if that weren't the whole point of an interview to begin with. And he keeps interrupting Cos! He doesn't follow intriguing paths that the legend opens up for him; he's just got a list of questions, and he's going to get them all asked, period.

Bill's in a warm, open mood, and willing to talk about his '60s albums, his opinions on his own previous, rare instances of ""bad taste, even without profanity,"" and other subjects that I want to hear more about. But the interviewer doesn't let him stay on one topic for more than a couple of minutes.

And Bill is so gentle with this guy; he really throws underhanded at him, and the latter just doesn't ask him any follow-up questions, such as ""Can you give us examples?"" or ""Since you've brought up the Noah routine, how did that originate?"" He just cuts Bill off: ""Let me ask you a question."" No, let him continue! He's talking about his early album period! We never get to hear his thoughts about that stuff!

Curiously, the interviewer also doesn't come off as much of a Cosby fan. Bill brings up ""Little Tiny Hairs,"" ""Karate"" and other old routines from his Warner Bros. period, and there's absolutely no look of recognition on the interviewer's face. He doesn't respond at all, in fact, other than with ""Let me ask you a question"" -- i.e. changing the subject entirely, which gets very frustrating. Granted, he'll occasionally put words in Bill's mouth. ""So what you're saying is..."" No, it's not what Bill's saying, and it fits the interviewer's own preconceived ""hoped-for answers.""

And Bill doesn't say anything, such as ""Hey, I was talking about my first album, not your production students,"" because...well, Bill's a nice guy, presumably.

I know I've gone on about this for a while, but it's really a shame that Dr. Cosby has never been asked intelligent, open-ended questions about his '60s and '70s material, or the relevant albums. I've read a lot of interviews, and the subject rarely even comes up. I hope this Comedy Central release indicates a multi-special contract, because I'm selfish and want more Cos -- and I hope that he gets better people to handle the bonus content on his forthcoming DVDs.

Anyway, yes, the special itself is highly recommended. He's very, very funny, and as great a storyteller as he's ever been. Thanks for reading this.",1387756800,,3331,4.750865051903114

Mr. Cosby is still hilarious without 4 letter words and content.  I am happy to have a comedy show to watch with ANYONE, and have an hour of laughter.",1386979200,7,278,4.111111111111111
5956087,5,B00EYA6VGY,"It is refreshing to be entertained by Bill Cosby , no swearing, vulgarity or obscenities needed to be enjoyable.  Funny and true to life one liners.",1386892800,,148,4.6923076923076925
5956088,2,B00EYA6VGY,"Slow and repetitive. Tried to finish watching five times , but I fall asleep. An ocassional joke here and there, but the whole routine can be edited down to ten minutes tops. Not worth buying.",1386892800,4,192,4.514285714285714
5956089,5,B00EYA6VGY,"""Bill Cosby...Far From Finished"" comes as a fitting end to the Bill Cosby Standup Trilogy.  The first installment being the infamous 1983 release ""Bill Cosby, Himself"" that is undeniably one of the best examples of stand up comedy there is and the other being a not so well known and never mentioned nor ever released on DVD special from 1987 called ""49.""  It is widely available on YouTube---I suggest you check it out.

When you look at all 3 of these specials you see how much they all tie together.  Cosby in each of these specials discusses topics that are important to him at that particular time.  In ""Himself"" he talks about childhood, his parents, life, marriage and having children.  In ""49"" he discusses reaching middle age and the trials of getting older even though you're young at heart.  And here in ""Far From Finished"" he celebrates life as seen by someone in their seventies.  Life changes as we get older and The Cos is the perfect person to guide us through it all.

Everyone is focused on how clean the comedy is and while that is definitely something that should be noted--the one factor people should really take note is just how amazingly crisp Bill Cosby's comedy still is today in 2013.  The guy has been at this for more than 50 years---and it would be an understatement to say that he ""knows what he's doing.""  Yes he does but he's also doing what very few other people are doing.

Bill Cosby's comedy style is radically different from many other popular comedians.  His comedy does not consist of quick one-liners that he rattles off one after the other.  Listening to Bill Cosby is like watching a beautiful sunset...there is no rush to get it over with--instead you sit and enjoy the beautiful sight in front of you.  Cosby's comedy pieces are long, incredibly detailed and very well organized.  The pacing is slower than most comedy specials because Cosby's comedy demands it.  He's a master weaver of story and as a storyteller, he takes care of his audience.  The audience is right there with him and that makes for an incredibly personal connection.

They filmed two shows for this DVD.  I attended the 3pm taping earlier that day and from what I can see, most if not all of the material on this DVD/BluRay comes entirely from the 7pm taping later that day.  Two completely different sets.  Any other comedian would have said ""Well, let me do my same set twice...so if there's anything I missed or flubbed at the 3pm show...we can grab from the 7pm show to edit together""  Not Cosby.  The 3pm show was nothing like the performance on this DVD from the 7pm show. This guy is such a pro that it boggles the mind how he's able to do this all so effortlessly.

This special is hilarious and for any students of comedy: incredibly educational.  You're watching a master at work here.  Thank goodness we have Bill Cosby.",1386720000,,2848,4.610337972166998
5956090,5,B00EYA6VGY,Another great Bill Cosby performance. I have listened to him for over 50 years qnd have yet to be disappointed.,1386720000,2,111,4.6
5956091,5,B00EYA6VGY,"I saw this special on Comedy Central and loved it.  Cosby's conversational style of comedy is unique and always has been.  I've been a fan since the LP ""Bill Cosby.....Right"". His DVD (or VHS depending on your age) releases have been treasures that I've seen again and again and still laugh until it hurts.  It's good to hear from an old friend and that is how this special feels.",1386547200,2,380,4.478260869565218
5956092,2,B00EYA6VGY,While there is no profanity......unless you like your comedy about making fun of your wife this one is not funny.  My family are fans and we were looking forward to this one.  Disappointed.  Does anyone know if there are other DVDs that are profanity free?,1386547200,6,256,4.644444444444445

5956094,4,B00EYA6VGY,"Definitely funny, but it could have been about 30 minutes shorter.
Spent a lot of the time on husband/wife relationships.  I wish he told more stories about the kids!",1386028800,,166,4.724137931034483
5956095,5,B00EYA6VGY,Another great performance by Cos.  I have a daughter getting married this weekend... her and the future husband will be watching this some evening this week.  Such is the timing!,1385942400,,178,4.9
5956096,5,B00EYA6VGY,"Refreshing comedy, nice clean fun!  I agree with other comments, the topics were mature but clean for anyone to listen, and funny! I remember Bill Cosby as a child and he still is as funny as ever. So tired of the other garbage on TV, was a nice change of pace. Highly recommend watching.",1385769600,,288,4.333333333333333
5956097,5,B00EYA6VGY,Bill Cosby is still the great comedian and entertainer.  He entertains in a manner that is appropriate for most ages.  He is a natural who doesn't need to resort to profanity to be funny!,1385769600,,187,4.470588235294118
5956098,5,B00EYA6VGY,"No profanity, no cursing, good clean comedy just like the good ol' days of stand-up comedy. The Cos makes a hilarious return from stories of security issues and the tale of a chocolate chip cookie tasting gone wrong and much more hilarious stuff like that. Highly Recommended to all Amazon shoppers.",1385769600,,299,4.882352941176471
5956099,5,B00EYA6VGY,"As far as I know, Cos's last concert was ""49"", and that was some 30 years ago.  He hasn't lost it, not by a long shot.  The only sign of any lack of energy is that he's sitting down the whole time, but it will leave most people incapacitated by laughter within 10 minutes.",1385683200,,272,4.018518518518518
5956100,5,B00EYA6VGY,"Bill Cosby has always made me laugh as well as think. In his latest performance, he is as always absolutely hilarious. We are so fortunate to have this comedic genius among us. This DVD is of a performance that aired on Comedy Central but it is well worth buying as it has quite a bit of additional, un-aired material. And as with the Cos' other works, this video has a very high potential for repeated viewings. I couldn't stop laughing the first time I watched it, and I look forward to watching it again. Good, hilarious fun for the whole family.",1385424000,,549,4.445544554455446
5956101,5,B00EYA6VGY,Saw it on comedy central and it was amazing. Bill Cosby at his best for sure. I really hope he makes more of these because he is extremely funny with out being overly crude,1385337600,10,172,4.088235294117647
5956102,5,B00EYA6VGY,"From the very start of this release you know it is something special. It begins on-stage, there's a small wooden nightstand center stage and a stage-hand carries out a very large chair that looks like a king's throne. He exits the stage and moments later comes back again to retrieve the chair. He then comes out with a smaller, but still decently sized stuffed chair and once again leaves the stage. He returns, retrieves the chair and then brings out a wooden dining room style chair. One last time he returns to the stage, retrieves that chair and finally comes out with a folding chair, showing his displeasure with having to move all of these chairs he doesn't even open it, instead he just tosses it on the ground and leaves the stage.

Only after this little scene does Bill Cosby hit the stage. The opening is pure genius, without saying a word and without having to have Cosby himself on the stage the tone of the night is set. Cosby doesn't see himself as a king that needs a throne or even a guy that needs a big comfy chair. He shows us in his unique way that he is perfectly fine sitting on a folding chair just like each and every one of us in the audience would be fine with such an arrangement.

The ""regular guy"" tone is indeed what Cosby's performance brings to life. He talks about relationships, marriage, his children and his friends. He is still one of the best storytellers alive and here on ""Far From Finished"" we see that in full force. Sure, he's a bit older, but his wit has not slowed down and he is still using facial expressions to say more than some comics can say with a dictionary full of words.

Both of my parents are in Cosby's age-range so his bits on the difference between a girlfriend and a wife and then about being married for years and years really hit home. Bill Cosby has the knack to take ordinary things and make them special. He had me laughing throughout this 90-minute show and not once did he utter a profane word.

Overall I'd highly recommend seeing this Cosby special no matter how old or young you are. Bill Cosby is a master comedian and storyteller who as the title alludes to still has a lot left in the tank! Thank you, Bill!",1385337600,2,2184,4.385185185185185

5956104,5,B00EYA6VGY,"Bill Cosby is still superb; he is excellent in telling a slow, long-drawn-out story where one fact builds upon another producing many laughs along the way. This seems to be a lost art. In this hour-long show, Cosby focuses on marriage and shows how what a man thinks is a girl friend who he wants to live with until he dies changes with marriage. She is no longer his friend, although she wants him to call her that. She is now his boss, and his best way of handling it is to remain silent. There are many vignettes within the story, such as the time his house alarm goes off, his wife is not home, and he cannot remember his code, so he calls his wife for help. Another good one, among many, is when he returns from a trip, is driving home, when his car stops working. He calls his wife asking to be picked up. As in his earlier show, many years ago, he includes a piece about his kids, although different, it is still hilarious. Yes; he is far from finished. Hopefully there will be more such shows in the future.",1385337600,4,1015,4.237113402061856
