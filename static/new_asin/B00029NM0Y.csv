2072273,5,B00029NM0Y,"Hi-5 is fresh, education and fun--even for the parents! This is one show where mom and dad will actually enjoy sitting with the kids and watching it! :) Color Craze is a unique way of incorporating colors into math, problem solving, word recognition, shapes and exercise.

 ""I want to watch Hi-5!...with YOU!!"" my son yells each morning.

2072274,5,B00029NM0Y,"We've been watching Hi-5 on The Learning Channel and Discovery Kids for about a year, give or take. As a parent of two teenagers and a four year old, I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like Hi5.
First of all, what an amazingly talented cast of actors/singers. And the songwriters have an uncanny knack of creating music that appeals to all age groups (adults and even teenagers!). Very, very hip.
Problem solving, Spatial and Language concepts, Art & Music and Physical Demonstration are recurring themes you'll see in each episode. But it's done in such an entertaining way that the kids don't even realize they are learning! A wonderful show to enrich their imaginations.
Very, very highly recommended! In fact, I would encourage you to check them out here first:

2072275,5,B00029NM0Y,"We have already preordered all three DVD's.  This is the best kids show.  My 4 year old watches every morning on TLC and Discovery kids and can't get enough of this show.  We were able to see them in concert and all of them are so nice.  Buy the DVD's you won't be disappointed.  The singing, dancing and skits are awesome!!!!",1085702400,8,326,4.278688524590164
2072276,5,B00029NM0Y,"My daughter LOVES all of the Hi-5 videos!  She started watching them around 1 year and learned to dance, clap, and jump with the music and high energy.  She is now 2 years old and still loves the videos.  She still dances and now knows some of the words to the songs, etc.  I like how the video is interactive, she's not just sitting and zoned out, she's burning off some energy.",1125100800,4,379,4.222222222222222
2072277,5,B00029NM0Y,"My son has been watching Hi-5 since he was only several months old.  Now, he is 1 1/2 years and asks to play this CD by holding his hand up and saying, ""hi-hi-hi"".  We never get sick of watching these very talented young people.  Even my husband gets into it and starts humming a song.  Music and dancing is great for infants and will stick with them as they grow up.  Get it for your children. Not only for their entertainment, but yours as well.  You will LOVE it too!!!",1123804800,3,472,4.188888888888889
2072278,4,B00029NM0Y,"I bought this DVD for my 4 & 2 yr old nieces. We hadn't ever seen Hi-5 before, but the movie never turned off that night! Over and over we danced, sang, learned about colors and shapes and had a blast doing it. The characters were not sappy or annoying - but light and fun. My sister says the movie hasn't turned off since I brought it that night. We are looking for more videos to learn with! Definitely worth every penny.",1122940800,4,423,4.170731707317073

2072280,5,B00029NM0Y,"This is one of the few shows that gets both my kids (ages 5 and 1/2 and 3) up and singing and dancing together. We reenact the dances often during playtime and sing the songs throughout the day. My only complaint is that since this video has 3 actual episodes, you get to hear the ""theme song"" twice for each episode, that's 6 (!!!!) times in one video! This may drive my husband and I batty, but the kids love the repetition and have memorized all of the lyrics and dance moves. I highly recommend this video!",1107820800,5,510,4.268041237113402
2072281,5,B00029NM0Y,My three year old and two year old both love this video.  I find myself singing along and actually feel happy about it...unlike some of the other kids tunes I catch playing in my head.  There is a great energy with the cast.  I just ordered the other two DVDs by Hi-5 and I'm confident my girls will love them.,1100649600,3,310,4.133333333333334
2072282,4,B00029NM0Y,"Hi-5, which airs on the Discovery Channel (and TLC) has several different themes. Each week a new theme is introduced by a catchy song & dance that is played at the beginning and end of each episode. Different sketches throughout the episode cover simple math, music, rhythm, imagination, language development, etc.

Having said that, if you love the show, you'll love all three of the DVDs which contain three episodes of their respective theme. The ""extras"" aren't really great - a karaoke singalong one with lyrics and the other with only music and words on the bottom of the screen. I'd have liked some more background on the making of the show or a little extra addition to the episode. (That's why it receives a 4 and not a 5).",1100044800,9,733,4.638461538461539
2072283,5,B00029NM0Y,"This DVD is the best! It's fun to learn with Hi-5. My daughter is 3 and she just loves them! No other characters have gotten her off the couch till Hi-5. The video motivates them to get up and exercise and jump around while they are also teaching them about feelings, seasons and colors. We have all three volumes - color craze, music time and game time and she loves them all!",1098316800,5,377,4.25
2072284,5,B00029NM0Y,"All of the DVD's in the series 1,2,3 are outstanding, educational,colorful and stimulating. Hi-5 is fantastic, their upbeat tunes make you want to get up and dance with your children. It is by far the ""BETTER"" of the children's musical groups to date. I strongly recommend these DVD's.  The children will learn, colors, shapes, friendship, caring, concern, teamwork, sharing.. I can go on and on. Just order the DVD's you won't be disappointed.",1091664000,6,444,5.082191780821918

8024710,1,B00029NM0Y,"I placed an order for Hi-5, Vol. 1 - Color Craze. The dvd in box is false advertising, possible fraud dvd. The dvd box claims it contains 3 episodes, total running time 1 hour plus bonus features. The item I received does not contain any of the above items. My disc contained one episode with no menu options or closing credits. This disc might be a fraud copy. The color was very poor.",1338854400,,386,4.301369863013699

8024713,5,B00029NM0Y,"I have a 21 month old who is obsessed with Hi-5!  I love that she is because of several things:

1) She has improved coordination and can follow along with everything in the dvd's
2) She gets her 14 year old brother and 15 year old sister to sing and dance with her.
3) Dad has even been taught to follow the moves.
4) If we mess up on a step---she corrects us!

It is so fun to see how condident and happy these videos make my little girl!  Highly recommend any of the dvd's and the show on TV.  We even watch OnDemand at Comcast if you have that digital cable service.",1191542400,,570,4.008849557522124
8024714,5,B00029NM0Y,"My children are already in love with the Hi-5 gang after watching early morning TLC.  Adding this DVD to our collection has proven to be beneficial in more than one way.  Primarily, it is incredibly educational and catches the attention of my 4-year-old, as well as my 6-year-old.  Other playmates of my children have given the same feedback...boys and girls, alike!  I highly recommend ALL the Hi-5 DVD's!",1170288000,,406,4.926470588235294

The songs are super catchy- I find myself singing them to myself sometimes. They are similar to ABBA. The dvds are also educational, but don't tell my kids!",1142812800,3,261,4.038461538461538
