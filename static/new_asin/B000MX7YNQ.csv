8173391,1,B000MX7YNQ,"I was extremely disappointed!! I ordered this film in the Italian movie section, and it came dubbed in French with English subtitles. I feel that I was totally misinformed- I was looking for an Italian speaking film.",1482710400,,216,4.864864864864865

8173393,4,B000MX7YNQ,"Entertaining, action-filled picture of Italian youths fated to become criminals. Gutsy, respectful of the real history of its era. A lot of fun.",1450137600,,144,5.304347826086956

8173395,5,B000MX7YNQ,"Romanzo criminale is about the start of a gang, the members: the Lebanese, the leader, who shows his ability to negotiate, of course in the ""mafia"" way: if they're not your friends, they're enemies...
Dandy, the one who lives in fashion, he goes to the best parties, wears the best clothes, and, of course, has a beautiful girl, despite the fact that she's actually a prostitute.
Fredo (Ice) honors his nickname. The coldest of them, he's intelligent and calculates everything. Of course he has a weak side: his girlfriend, a tutor, who knows nothing about his real life and she finds out in the worst way...

The film is about 2 hours and half long, but it's really catchy that no one notices it. Great plot, amazing actors, and the music just how it says in the backcover of the dvd: sounds like if it came out from Scorsese's itunes!",1257724800,9,836,4.573333333333333
8173396,5,B000MX7YNQ,I never had seen a movie that shows you the real colors of the Italian mafia. It gives and understanding how Italian politics and mafia mix together to attain their own benefits. It's truly a mixture of The Godfather and Scarface put together in a blender to get Romanzo Criminale.,1234051200,7,281,4.64
8173397,4,B000MX7YNQ,"Don't be mislead by the tacky cover. Although this begins as a cheaper, poorer quality version of The Godfather, it develops into to a quite sophisticated and controversial take on Italian crime and politics. A previous (UK) reviewer laments the fact that the characters were cheap, humourless scumbags compared to the more likeable and funny murderers of Goodfellas. Well, that's because Hollywood, even at its best, will usually make its main characters sympathetic, whereas here we see the characters as they are - ruthless, fairly stupid, nasty, brutal and unpleasant. Killers are like that. Based on real events and ultimately worthwhile, the film certainly made me want to read the book it's based on and find out more about the issues raised here. Entertaining too.",1217894400,16,772,5.184
