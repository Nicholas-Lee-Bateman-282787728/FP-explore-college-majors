8427122,4,B004EL5NCQ,"This is from the house of Mahesh Bhatt with Jackie Shroff and Manisha Koirala. A nice movie with nice story and background score. The song ""Kahin to Milegi..."" still skips the heart a bit when heard. Nice direction and acting by lead pairs, the movie went wrong somewhere for which it didn't appeal to the masses. This is one among the finest performances of Manisha Koirala till date.
Raja (Jackie Shroff) is a smuggler and has a sweetheart called Priya (Manisha Koirala). Priya doesn't like her profession and asks him to surrender with the belief that he will get away soon from Jail and they can live happily ever after. Raja surrenders to the police only to be convicted of a murder he hasn't committed. He is sent to Jail where he is harassed further by the corrupt police officers.
Outside the Jail, Priya is harassed by Raja's old colleagues in crime and the corrupt police officers. Now Raja has to come out of the Jail to rescue Priya from them and also to find out the person responsible for his conviction. Now will the officials let him go that easily?",1302480000,,1065,4.5811518324607325
