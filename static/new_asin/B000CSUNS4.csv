8102270,4,B000CSUNS4,"Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy & Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton and twenty-two other Hollywood love stories are the subjects of HOLLYWOOD COUPLES, a 5-disc DVD collection from Passport Video.  Each program, which debuted on European television, is one-hour in length.

I would not have been aware of this documentary series had I not written 3 of the segments [Clark Gable & Carole Lombard, Orson Welles & Rita Hayworth, Laurence Olivier & Vivien Leigh).

Essentially presented in chronological order, the episodes, which consist of vintage film clips, newsreel footage, rare photographs and on-camera interviews, begin with George Burns & Gracie Allen, and include Frank Sinatra & Ava Gardner, Howard Hughes & Jean Peters, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz, Marilyn Monroe & Joe DiMaggio, Tony Curtis & Janet Leigh, Natalie Wood & Robert Wagner, Sonny & Cher, Steve McQueen & Ali McGraw, Paul Newman & Joanne Woodward, Mel Brooks & Anne Bancroft, Clint Eastwood & Sandra Locke, Woody Allen & Mia Farrow, Warren Beatty & Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin & Kim Basinger, Bruce Willis & Demi Moore, Brad Pitt & Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman and Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Many of these stories don't end happily and several of them are still being written, yet each one gives a fascinating, in-depth look at two volatile personalities whose pairings captured the attention and imaginations of people throughout the world.
