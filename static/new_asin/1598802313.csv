7800055,5,1598802313,"Six episodes from the Public Television series: Rick Steves' Europe. It features; Copenhagen, Denmark beyond Copenhagen, Norway's West: Fjords, Mountains, and Bergen, Oslo, Stockholm, and Helsinki.  I loved Norway and the Fjords, and could just see myself on the boat. Sweden was too sparse for me, as I wanted more than Stockholm although the city is beautiful.  I would like to see more of the farming country, the simple life, homes, cabins in the woods or with a lake view.  I'd like more about the Midnight Sun and more of port cities like Ystad.  Yet it does give the flavor of Scandinavia which is surprisingly close to Germany and Estonia.  It gives me the flavor of Scandinavia that I'm searching for.",1424390400,,710,4.8347107438016526

7800057,3,1598802313,"First the DVD is not the best recording of the program and has a few glitches on it.  The DVD video quality fair and does come close to meeting todays standards.  Secondly, the program is just too old. Rick needs to produce a new set of Scandinava programs and Blue Ray.",1381708800,,270,4.2745098039215685
7800058,5,1598802313,"This is another great dvd by Rick Steves, all of his are informative and beautiful. This covered all of the north and hopefully I'll be able to go there one day.
