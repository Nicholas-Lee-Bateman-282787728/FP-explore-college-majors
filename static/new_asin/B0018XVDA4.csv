Joanna comes across Charlie played by David Orth. At first Joanna seems hesitant to hire Charlie but he proves that he's good at domestic chores and good with her son. Charlie has good references and seems great. Everything goes well but then Joanna's husband, Paul (Barclay Hope) starts being suspicious of charlie and starts to feel like Charlie is taking over and feels a little threatened by the man.
Charlie sets things up to look like Paul is having an affair so that Joanna will kick him out and this works and that's when the real danger begins. Joanna finds out at the last minute that Charlie is a fraud and that he is dangerous and she then has to rescue her son- and herself from this psycho.
In the end of the movie it does seems like Charlie is obsessed with Joanna and with having Joanna and her son Sam as a family.
Great movie about a Psycho obsessive male nanny.",1222387200,2,943,4.394285714285714
