To the director by the way I still believe that the mizrahim can still become leaders in Israel in addressing the Arab world because at least they have a very good knowledge of the Arabs and understanding of them since many spoke the same language.but the Ashkenazim always discriminated them  and never believed they had the ability if only they give their middle eastern Jewish brethren a chance.,1524960000,,597,4.900990099009901
