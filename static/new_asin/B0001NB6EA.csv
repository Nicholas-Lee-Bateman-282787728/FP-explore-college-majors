8014981,4,B0001NB6EA,"I am happy about this video. The seller I bought it from described the item acurately. It's cute stories about things that go- mail truck, dump truck etc.",1194480000,,154,4.535714285714286
8014982,3,B0001NB6EA,"My 2 yr. son loves this video and it has become one of his favorites. However, he's probably only watched it a dozen or so times. Now the video is starting to mess up. The picture bleeps in and out and becomes fuzzy and the sound is distorted in certain spots. This must be very cheaply made to hardly last a month! This video came as part of the Ramps Around Garage set from FP. When this video wears out, I won't pay money to replace it.",1130976000,,439,4.057471264367816
8014983,5,B0001NB6EA,"This is the first in the series from the children's toy manufacturer that I have seen and it is a treasure.  At his insistence I watched the video with my three-year-old nephew two nights ago.

As a boomer that grew up with ""Davy & Goliath"" and ""Gumby,"" I related to the stilted stop motion/clay animation, finding it a pleasure to see in these computer-generated times.  Perhaps this simple form of animation is essential in presenting the stories that are heavy in simple values that children can easily grasp.

The set includes five stories, each centered on one of the quintet of kids that star in the series.  The tales are ""Eddie's Big Race,"" ""Sonya Lee and the Super Sundae,"" ""Maggie Brings the Mail,"" ""The Wheels on the Boat,"" and ""The Parade of Wheels.""  Each of them promotes suitable life lessons that small fry can grasp and parents can reinforce through discussion.  Another plus is that each character represents a different ethnic and/or gender, subtlety teaching about diversity and acceptance.

And, besides that, the colors are really cool!

My nephew will be getting another video...just so we both can share the quality time together!",1104451200,2,1154,4.937823834196891
