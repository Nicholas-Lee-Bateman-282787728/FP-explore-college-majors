7966165,4,B00006ADF8,"I for one am not the least bit bothered by the dated film and sound qualities or the rather simple sets; I expect those things when coming to a historic performance, and anyone who criticizes those elements for not being up to modern standards is simply being silly.  And, this DVD is worth having for the exceedingly rare film documentation of both Renata Tebaldi and George in complete roles.  That said, neither one is quite in top form; Tebaldi's once creamy voice is starting to show its age in the top register, with occasional notes slightly off pitch and a tad harsh, while London's voice displays some of the instability that would result in the paralysis of a vocal chord and sudden end to his career in only a few more years.  He also over-acts and is nowhere near as suave a Scarpia as Tito Gobbi.  While the exceedingly obscure Eugene Tobin is not in the same league as his two illustrious colleagues, no particular apologies need be made for him either.  He has a powerful, secure voice with secure top notes and sings with appropriate passion; he is far superior to the mediocrities such as Marcello Giordani that the Met features nowadays as ""star"" tenors.

All that said, this is  an item primarily for fans of Tebaldi (including me) and London.  A historical document of equal or greater importance is the DVD of Tosca with the legendary Magda Olivero (still alive at age 103!), who was the only singer in living memory to rival Callas in this role.  Her Cavaradossi (Alvino Misciano) is significantly inferior to Tobin, but she enjoys superior sets and conducting and a more genuinely Italianate Scarpia (Giulio Fioravanti).  For those wanting a Tosca on DVD in modern sound and video quality, turn to either of Domingo's performances filmed on site in Rome, one with Raina Kabaivanska, Sherrill Milnes, and Bruno Bartoletti (my favorite) or else with Catherine Malfitano, Ruggiero Raimondi, and Zubin Mehta.",1367193600,,1927,4.847560975609756
7966166,4,B00006ADF8,"The DVD of Tosca is wonderful and presents two of the greatest interpreters of the middle 20th century.  Tebaldi  and London are stunning in their parts both vocally and dramatically.  Some have dismissed Tebaldi as an actress, but I find her performance quite stunning.  London is vocally at his finest and appropriately slimmy as Scarpia.  It is a  wonderful documentation of two of the vocal giants of the previous century.  Buy it now!",1337212800,,439,4.931506849315069
7966167,5,B00006ADF8,"How lamentable that DVD recording technology did not exist half a century and more ago, so that we today could see and hear legendary singers like Caruso and Maria Callas in full-length opera productions.  By the same token, how grateful we should be that some productions were filmed and, despite imperfections, are available to us today. One of these productions is Renata Tebaldi's ""Tosca"", which gives the modern-day opera lover a good taste of truly gorgeous singing and an understanding of why prima donnas like Tebaldi achieved their iconic status. In this Stuttgart Opera production, not only can one admire the great Tebaldi, but become acquainted with other singers of the era, such as tenor Eugene Tobin (Cavaradossi) and baritone George London, whose performance as Scarpia is nothing short of superb; to me, not only his singing but his stage-presence convey the evil nature of opera's most famous villain and must be what Puccini had in mind when he created this character. Black and white film? Back in the forties, Hollywood would routinely film a drama in black and white; somehow, it conveyed the more serious nature of a drama, as opposed to a musical or comedy. For me, black and white works perfectly in this opera, and truthfully, given the choice of color or B & W, I would choose the latter for this particular production.  No stereo here, but the high-fidelity monaural sound will make you forget this detail.  I highly recommed this DVD to any serious collector of operas.",1280966400,,1498,4.936507936507937
7966168,5,B00006ADF8,"Of course, it is pure melodrama....but what melodrama when being sung by Renata Tebaldi and George London. Eugene Tobin, an American who never quite made it into the first rank, still  performs quite ably and in no way detracts from the distinguished heroine and villain of the piece. It is in Black and White, and while I cannot tell how that influenced a younger audience, to one who grew up before the Age of Technicolor in movies, and, later before color on television, it took only a few minutes to adjust. For, what is a Puccini opera but an opportunity for beautiful and dramatic singing. Nearing 40 when this live performance was filmed, Tebaldi is at or near the top of form but George London, only two years her senior, is brilliant here, but had only a few more years of good singing in him before his physical condition forced him to quit singing at age 46. We are fortunate, indeed, to have this full performance of one of his key  roles, permanently recorded.(See if you notice what one commentator writes: (Tosca)...was made late in his career and the paralysis of half his face is clearly visible. 
I fully enjoyed this recording (despite that operatic tradition of applauding at the end of a favored aria during an Act). Tebaldi has recorded other versions of the opera, but not partnered with the ill-fated, and much missed, London",1252627200,,1349,4.7076271186440675
7966169,4,B00006ADF8,"But the Cavaradossi, a tenor called Eugene Tobin whom I didn't know of, conspires against my granting it outright, as he is simply of a lower level than Tebaldi's or London's. The stage production itself also contributes, out of its own anodyne-ness. But let's not complain too much: we are to thank heavens for the fact that this video tape was kept in the vaults of SDR, the South German Broadcasting Corp., and survived in such a good condition four decades of storage for it allows us to see a legend of 20th century opera singing in one of her signature roles, in full command of her conditions and in a complete performance at that. From the other great Tosca of the times, Maria Callas, we only have the second act, in two separate performances that I know of (are there more stashed away in the archives of some european TV station or opera house?) but her vocal conditions in those two videos were not the most adequate, even in the earlier of the two, her Paris debut. She of course was the better actress (Tebaldi's suffering of Polio infection in her childhood reputedly limited her stage movements, according to critics) but ""La signorina""'s voice was unique and in a class of its own, far more subtle and cultivated than Callas's. George London was a masterful Scarpia, a nasty impersonation with a master degree in cynicism, and he proved also a very accomplished actor; his voice was enormous, powerful as perhaps none other of his generation. Both he and Tebaldi are featured in Decca's late 1950's stereo recording to good effect, accompanied by Del Monaco's short on subtlety Cavaradossi. Callas is, of course much better served in the rightfully legendary 1954 EMI recording than in the videos I made reference to, and far less well so in the 1964 stereo remake.

The rest of the cast are downright substandard: the Spoletta barely bothers to sing, preferring to speak many of his interventions, the Sacristan and Angelotti fare better but sing in some sort of semi-italian that would be booed today.

Patan was well known, as was also his brother Giuseppe, as exponent of a tradition of opera conducting that was earned after hard work in the orchestra pit in provincial theatres in the deep Italian boot. That tradition hardly exists now. Sound is alright as is also the video image, rather fuzzy by today's standard but mind this dvd comes from a 1962 black and white video tape.",1106870400,16,2402,4.744019138755981
7966170,3,B00006ADF8,"Tebaldi and London clearly have this opera down pat--they can emerge after grueling singing and still smile sweetly like movie stars at the audience.  The sets are primitive by today's standards, the staging/lighting is also very elementary although London manages somes effective serpentine movements.  It is fantastic to see Tebaldi and London perform but the picture quality is only fair and the sound not nearly as good as the contemporary (1960) London/Decca CD set with T, L, and Del Monaco.",1096761600,5,497,5.2
7966171,5,B00006ADF8,"This extraordinary DVD brings the talents of Renata Tebaldi and George London to digital excitement.
The picture is smooth and very detailed, while the sound is of CD quality. For those who have this performance on video, this release tops it, in both sound and picture. The menu photos are glorious, and the natural sound of the original venue comes through like never before. This DVD is playable in ALL regions, and comes with optional English subtitles.
This is the BEST quality of an actual opera performance, complete, with Renata Tebaldi and George London. In fact, it's London's ONLY complete opera captured on video. It's also terrific to jump to favorite parts of the opera, as well as repeat those you love. The packaging is sleek as well. Truly a DVD for your library.
Let's hope that the CHENIER and OTELLO find their way to DVD as well. But none will have the quality of this Stuttgart TOSCA. Grab it now!!!",1032134400,34,921,4.726708074534161
7966172,5,B00006ADF8,"This video, carefully and painstakingly remastered from VAI, is the BEST video we have of Renata Tebaldi in an actual opera performance. VIDEOTAPED in 1961 in Stuttgart, the performance leaves you breathless. Also of  considerable note, this is George London's ONLY complete opera performance  on video. He certainly gives Gobbi a run for his money as Scarpia, bringing  his own tremendous characterization to the role. Tobin is quite good, but  those who watch with careful eyes, in the (GREAT) close-ups, you will see  Renata feeding him his lines! This ENTIRE performance is played to the  audience, not to television cameras. It is EXTREMELY great condition, a  very fine, detailed black and white print, and CD quality sound. It's like  you were right there!  Tebaldi's performance is superb, and with the  exception of a less-than-great Tokyo video, this is the only video of  Tebaldi ONSTAGE in this role. Truly great work from ALL, there is not one  second missing from this video. It's NOT film, it's a videotape, and  evidently was not ruined before VAI got to it! Thankfully, for those of us  too young to ever have seen Tebaldi live in a performance, this video  exists. It is not only a MUST, it's a cannot do without!  100 stars!",959040000,5,1243,4.875598086124402
