2857105,5,B000R34WDG,"This disc just came in and I have been playing it on my Toshiba A2 HD DVD player and it works great.  The scenery is so beautiful and music takes me back to my trips to Arizona.  It is a great disc for playing in the background for parties or remembering your trips to this great state.  I have the DVD version of this disc and was exited to see it released for HD DVD.  The video quality is great, the menus are easy to navigate, and I love the loop feature.  This disc is worth every cent and you can't beat the price!",1183334400,8,520,3.9615384615384617
2857106,1,B000R34WDG,"As for the other title from the same ""studio"" :  What a difference between a documentary and a post card ? A little bit of soul.
Very far away from ""Planet Earth""
As HD DVD, I'm surprised of the low quality of the shooting or the transfert : it look like a poor standard DVD.
Over saturated colors, over exposed (whites) instable images, jolts, judder, dirt on the camera lens and helicopter reflects...  I have the impression of beeing fooled...",1193875200,2,446,4.5625
2857107,2,B000R34WDG,"PROS:
Arizona is incredibly beautiful so almost any scenic film of it is going to be very interesting

The coloring, mostly reds and oranges (contrasted with the blue sky), is often stunning

CONS:
Filmed in only 1080i.  Why not take advantage of 1080p?  Trust me, there IS a huge difference.

POOR editing choices.  Another reviewer mentioned the ""MTV-style editing"" (meaning very short cuts).  This is my biggest problem with this movie.  Why splice 7 to 15 second cuts together when a nice 1-3 minute sweep or slow panorama to zoom-tight is so much powerful?  For example, watch the quintessential 4 HD DVD ""Planet Earth"" BBC series for how this Dreaming Arizona should have been edited.  Unfortunately, that is a much, much better scenic documentary than this somewhat amatuerish effort.

This might seem picayunish but there was a spot on either the camera lens or the helicopter bubble that was very annoying as it showed up right in the middle of the screen throughout most of the movie.

For a movie that was filmed in High Definition video, then transferred to HD DVD, the picture quality is not very impressive.  There is far too much graininess and pixelation for a HD medium.  They either used inferior HD cameras in the original filming or they did a poor digital transfer.

SUMMARY:
Overall, it was a decent movie and it was interesting to say the least.  Also, for less than $11 from Amazon, you'll probably feel like you got your money's worth.  However, in this day of High Definition and with so many better quality HD DVDs out there, the producers of this video could have done a much, much better job.",1189123200,2,1621,4.752688172043011
2857108,3,B000R34WDG,"Like a reviewer before me, I got this disk after seeing planet earth and was a little disappointed, the disk is pretty much however many minutes of the camera driving or flying by things, which can be beautiful as Arizona is arguably the most diverse and interesting states we have. Another annoyance is that they forever needed a filter on the lens, so sometimes its very washed out in the sunlight, thats bad since most of the video is of beautifully colored rock. Like someone else said, its a good party disk but for a movie experience you will feel cheated.",1188691200,3,562,4.574257425742574
2857109,5,B000R34WDG,"Not being a person who likes to spend time writing reviews, this HD DVD really got to me. I love the music, in particular the New Age Native American music, which is new to me. Combined with very unusual moving images of very unusual land- and waterscapes in Arizona, I felt drawn into another world.
It's funny & pathetic how the reviewer from Arizona wanted to tweak the colors on his set to make it look more ""real""?? Isn't the whole idea of art to stylize? These shots are spectacular and obviously color-corrected for enhanced viewing experience. ""reality"" colors would look drab and dull even when the subject is unusual. The editing is superb and the overall visual style of the presentation is captivating.  The images flow and always keep moving. I just wish it was longer and I would have preferred surround sound. But then again, the source music must be 2-channel stereo and 5.1 could sound fake....",1187913600,4,911,4.729559748427673
2857110,2,B000R34WDG,"Having watched the BBC's planet earth on HD-DVD I went in search of something
else in that genre and came across this disc. Living in Arizona I thought it'd be fun to have a copy. When I watched it I must say I was some what disappointed. The editing is really quite poor. At times they flip back and forth between shots in a manner best suited to some MTV video, not a scenic portrayal. Then there are the ""shot out of the car window"" pieces that don't really seem up to the task. My final gripe was that no matter what I did to the color settings I could not get a realistic rendition of what I've seen in person a number of times.. In conclusion, it's probably worth 11$ if you've never been to all the places they show, but only 11$ - you get what you pay for.",1187913600,10,764,4.066225165562914
2857111,2,B000R34WDG,"This is good for scenery, but lacks a little bit for HD.  It also lacks for the choice of music.  It's basically the same music throughout or your choice of Native American Music, which is also basically the same music throughout.  One good point is that it isn't too expensive to purchase.",1187827200,2,290,4.538461538461538
2857112,3,B000R34WDG,"The Arizona landscape is 2nd to none. However, I do wish they would have covered a little more of the state as well as spending more time in Monument valley.
If you have the desire to see great vistas, landscape untouched by man, as well as some hints for travel or a reminder of your previous trips,...this will satisfy most definitely.",1186358400,5,337,4.540983606557377
2857113,5,B000R34WDG,I own this title on standard-def DVD and upgraded to check out the picture quality. And this Hi-def presentation was just what I expected - beautiful. Since this was shot with HD cameras you finally see the images as they were originally intended. It feels like you're there!  And you can loop the show and just relax in front of your screen. Choose two different soundtracks or just play your own music. Very recommended!,1184371200,4,422,4.702702702702703
2857114,5,B000R34WDG,"I purchased the DVD of ""dreaming Arizona"" when I last visited the Grand Canyon. I purchased the HDDVD because I was curious about how much more clarity I could get with HDDVD. I own a Toshiba HD player that I purchased from Costco for [...]. I was blown away by the difference in picture quality. My DVD has been bumped from my shelf to storage. The menus that are accessible from within each title on the disc make it easy to explore the entire disc. I especially like the captions that rise from below the screen to show the location of the shot. I hope there are plans to make ""dreaming Nevada"" on HDDVD. I'd love to see Las Vegas on HD!",1183334400,10,640,4.254098360655738
2857115,5,B000R34WDG,"I purchased this HD DVD not really knowing what to expect.  I haven't picked up a scenic DVD or HD DVD before, but when I watched this I fell in love.  The video quality is top notch and I haven't had any problems playing this on my Toshiba player I picked up at Costco.  My wife and I have enjoyed watching this HD DVD and it is great to put on in the background for our newborn because of the symphonic music and beautiful scenery.  I look forward to more releases.",1183334400,8,467,4.0989010989010985

8198528,1,B000R34WDG,"This is an HD DVD that can only be played on older equipment.  Think of buying a Betamax tpe nowadays expecting it to work on the old VCR. Not going to happen.  Shame on these guys.

8198530,3,B000R34WDG,"This was much more of a homemade video than I expected, although the scenery was great, with a high def camera and a fast computer, I could have done the same thing. If you don't live in the state, and want to see it from a perspective that is very realistic to what you would see yourself if you were to drive through these same areas, this will not disappoint you. The video has some scenes where you are flying as well. I may be a bit critical of this video because I live in the state, my current job has me driving all over Arizona, and I also happen to be a pilot, so I get to experience all the beauty quite frequently, so take it as you may... The audio seemed to be just an afterthought to fill in for the video. I would have much rather chose to hear some commentary from state historians and locals about facts and interests of the areas they were showing. In conclusion, if you are from out of state and have a HD-DVD player, the price is right; I don't think you will be disappointed. On the other hand if you have lived in Arizona for awhile and you are looking to learn about the state as opposed to just seeing images of it, save your money.",1204502400,5,1157,4.123893805309734

8198533,3,B000R34WDG,"This work is just OK. Very sub-par when you consider Blue Planet or Planet Earth sets. It's a shame that the production company used a Cessna instead of a helicopter( you can see the plane's outline in many shots). The ""fly-over""'s were just way to quick. The music is just terrible for it . Granted; you can choose Native American music which certainly adds to the feel of the landscapes but the Orchestral score is nothing stellar. Either music set you choose; niether is perfectly matched. Bottom line is; the views and contnet are just ok which certainly befits the lower price tag. I can't help but feel like there should have been more and better content.",1201392000,4,661,4.6581196581196584
8198534,1,B000R34WDG,"I have been to Arizona, Lake Powell and Zion several times and I was really looking forward to seeing this HD-DVD.  Boy was I disappointed.  I agree with several other reviewers that the color was bad, editing was bad.  This was not a true HD-DVD.  It was definitely an attempt to show a normal DVD in HD format.  The pictures were grainy the scene cuts were too quick.

I never return a video and know I would only get a partial refund since I opened it, I still returned it anyway.  I will stick to my home movies of Arizona instead.  Save the moeny.",1199059200,2,552,4.240384615384615
8198535,1,B000R34WDG,"Oversaturated colors and lower than average images kills this documentary. I've been few times in this area and I know how beautiful and powerful images you can film there. Sometimes, oversaturated colors are so unreal that it looks like a posterization effect. Staying closer to natural colors and getting off the road more time could help.
Big Deception...

8198536,4,B000R34WDG,"This title really deserves five stars in my opinion, but I gave it four because there is no narration option.  That would have made it perfect.  The scenery in HD is absolutely stunning and I love the Native American music.  The map feature is a nice extra.  An option for narration with music in the background (something like Planet Earth) would have put this disc beyond five stars, though it is still enjoyable as it is.",1195516800,,424,4.5394736842105265
