189365,1,1572521384,"Steven Soderbergh apparently had no faith in Gray's storytelling skills,  so you get 30 minutes of Gray, and 30 minutes of videotape of some people  commenting on him.
WHAT A WASTE!
Ignore Gray's Anatomy, and check out  Swimming to Cambodia, Monster in a Box, or even the HBO special Terrors of  Pleasure. You'll get more Gray without the incessant need of Soderbergh to  ""liven"" up Gray's monologue. These other films are Gray and Gray  alone. He doesn't need an intrusive, meddling heavy hand like Soderbergh.  Ugh.",965174400,14,517,4.941860465116279

7797658,4,1572521384,"Though not as on target as his earlier films ""Swimming to Cambodia"" and ""Monster in a Box,""  this tale of Spalding's ""macular pucker"" and the many odd and outrageous ways he sought to solve the problem without surgery is a testament to the late comedian's legacy as a fantastic storyteller.",1307059200,,290,4.8
7797659,4,1572521384,"If you enjoyed ""Swimming to Cambodia"", then you will enjoy this film also. If you haven't scene ""Swimming to Cambodia"" buy this but watch ""Swimming to Cambodia"" first.",1125532800,2,167,5.0
7797660,5,1572521384,"This is a wonderful example of the 'gift of gab' - that is, the art of telling a story.  Spalding Gray has a story to tell - mind you, the plot is not nearly as interesting as, say, a Jedi Knight fighting a battle in a galaxy far, far away.  It is not so much what he has to say, but how he says it.  If one of your favorite childhood memories includes sitting around a campfire listening to someone spinning a yarn about a headless ghost, then you might enjoy this more adult version of a scary story.  Substitute the encounter with a headless horseman with an even more frightening trip to see a doctor to diagnose an incurable medical condition and you may start to understand this movie.  It was fascinating listening to his tangential logic, flashbacks, and digressions of a gifted story teller.  It is also somewhat of an insight into the mind Spalding Gray, whose favorite story was the life experience he gained by walking around Washington Square Park several times, breathing in all of life's drama.",1095552000,4,1009,4.54696132596685
7797661,5,1572521384,"Spalding Gray's death has left us poorer than when we started. How evident this is after viewing this edgy, moving, often riotous monologue directed by Stephen Soderbergh.
A macular ""pucker"" leaves Gray virtually blind in one eye.  Born into Christian Science, Gray leaves the church when his CS practitioner demands he renounce allopathic medicine to receive help. Gray's breathless journeys through alternative healing remind us that we all face mortality at any cost, and that no religious or philosopical system will spare us the inevitability of suffering or dying.
What I loved most about this film were Gray's frequent outbursts of humor -- framed in frustration, delivered in sentences which resonate like poetry in the mind, this guy rages -- quite literally -- against the dying of the light. And I would add that this is a film best viewed late at night.
While Soderbergh's direction is occasionally heavy-handed and self- conscious, it is still creative and ambitious and will never disqualify this film from classic status.
The movie doesn't benefit from the opening montage of ""eye horror stories"" delivered by subjects who almost lost their sight, and who occasionally make an unwelcome visit into Gray's monologue. Happily, Gray gets 'round them.
The man had a brilliant, brilliant mind and a great heart.  Watch this, and the only thing you risk is awareness of his absence, and it is a sad feeling.
I just loved this movie, or should I say: I loved this mirror.",1079913600,16,1479,5.03265306122449
7797662,4,1572521384,"I had seen a brief bit of this when I was younger and always wondered what movie that was where a guy just sits there talking to a camera. Well luckily, I accidently discovered it again. I wasn't sure a movie like this could actually carry more for 2 hours but when it was over, I was amazed that time had passed so quickly. Spawlding is a great storyteller, and you will not be bored, guaranteed. Now, how much of it is true? That I wonder. But who cares, 'cause movies aren't usually true anyway, even when they claim to be.",1070323200,3,526,4.217821782178218
7797663,5,1572521384,"entertaining, well fleshed out with the stories of other patients - Spalding Gray at his best.",1063152000,,94,4.9375
7797664,4,1572521384,"Unlike Demme's approach with Swimming to Cambodia, which, like Stop Making Sense, tried to capture the essence of a live performance, Soderberg tries to get inside Gray's head, crawl out and display what's in there.
That I prefer Swimming to Cambodia is not too much of a criticism as Gray's Anatomy has a lot going for it.
The whole thing is carried by Spalding's energy, wit and charisma and if the stylistic, visual tropes detract from Spalding's natural performance they are at least imaginatively conceived.
I liked the vox pops inserts, but (having read the book version) I was dismayed that their addition seemed to mean that a whole chunk of the monologue was ommited (Gray's marriage to Renee).
However, on the basis of Grays Anatomy and Swimming to Cambodia (I have Monster in a box on order) I wish more of his monologues were filmed - one a year would do me fine.",1021075200,,875,4.688311688311688
7797665,5,1572521384,"Incredible writer and monologuist Spalding Gray takes us on an incredible  journey, around the world and through his soul. Though based on his his  attempts to avoid dangerous eye surgery, the story is really about meeting  fascinating characters and Gray's own fascinating neuroses. If the idea of  a monologue sounds boring to you -- basically Gray sitting and telling you  a story -- I especially challenge you to try this out.
While dry, Gray's  humor keeps you laughing out loud. You'll find it mesmerizing, and at the  end of your own journey through the film, changed for the better. Highly  recommended.",965260800,15,611,4.98019801980198
