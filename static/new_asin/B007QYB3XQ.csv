5105035,3,B007QYB3XQ,I have many other workout/dance tapes... this one just seems like they were making it up as they went. I tried it twice but I haven't used it again.,1362960000,2,148,4.137931034482759
5105036,3,B007QYB3XQ,"This workout has a lot of potential because it actually looks like a lot of fun. But I'm not a dancer and I have zero experience with Latin dance moves. Cheryl is fun to dance with; I just wish there was a feature on this DVD where they slowly walk you through the moves. I even tried to play the video in slow motion, but just couldn't get certain moves down. I was also unfamiliar with the ballroom dance terms used to the video. (Perhaps part of the problem was that this was my first time trying Jazzercise; I don't know.) In the end, I just tried to follow along and keep moving, but I really wanted to know how to do the moves properly. Judi, the founder, is pretty annoying and her arms flying everywhere when she's leading her segments of the workout is pretty distracting. I'll try this workout a few more times, but if I can't figure out the moves after a few more tries, I'll probably quit and move onto something else.",1360540800,,930,4.2897727272727275
5105037,5,B007QYB3XQ,"This exercise will work your legs, core and make you burn calories.  I love Cheryl Burke's take on the Latin dances, not hard to follow...you don't have to do everything exactly right if you forget the sequence.  I will there were more Jazzercise with Cheryl Burke she is incredible!",1357516800,2,283,4.755102040816326
5105038,5,B007QYB3XQ,"This is a great video for a early morning workout, it is fun and will wake you up for the day.",1356652800,2,94,3.5238095238095237
5105039,2,B007QYB3XQ,"Well now I know why I was told I won't find a Jazzercise video that even comes close to a class!  No one I have talked to (over 10 people now) can stomach the founder - if she would get over herself and let someone else do the videos she would make a much bigger fortune.  She is awful.

We all want to Hear the music, want to see the dance step. Somewhere in the process explain what they are doing, if it is a difficult move or they need to explain which muscles you are exercising and where you should feel it.",1349222400,28,513,3.9611650485436893
5105040,3,B007QYB3XQ,"Eh, Cheryl is a great dancer, not such a great fitness instructor.",1448150400,,66,4.583333333333333
5105041,4,B007QYB3XQ,VERY GOOD AND SIMPLE EXERCISES TO FOLLOW TO THE TUNE OF GREAT MUSIC...  NOT MUCH THINKING AND A LOT OF MOVING WILL GET YOUR BLOOD GOING AND YOUR BODY FLEXIBLE AND LEANER!  A GOOD BUY!,1447804800,,183,4.2
5105042,2,B007QYB3XQ,I am a Jazzerciser and I think it would have been so much better if it was only Judy instructing.  Cheryl did most of the routines and it seemed like it was the same move over and over.  Burlesque is much better.,1436659200,,212,4.023809523809524
5105043,1,B007QYB3XQ,"I should have paid attention to the other written reviews I read here.  I do jazzercise DVDs and they are great, not only is this one extremely annoying that you turn the sound down, it is the same movements almost every segment and Cheryl is extremely difficult to follow, I wasted my money because I didn't even complete it the first time I turned it on.",1430697600,,356,4.393939393939394
5105044,1,B007QYB3XQ,Not enough instructions I didn't get a good workout. Very disappointed,1429574400,,70,5.454545454545454
5105045,2,B007QYB3XQ,Disappointing for a jazzercise workout. Would not reccommend.,1427587200,,61,6.75
5105046,3,B007QYB3XQ,I will keep giving it a try.  It's not what I expected.  Definitely NOT a beginner style DVD.  It felt very advanced and hard for me to follow.,1426291200,,143,4.035714285714286
5105047,5,B007QYB3XQ,Great and quick delivery,1424563200,,24,5.25
5105048,2,B007QYB3XQ,I recently purchased this video - don't waste your money.  I love Jazzercise but Cheryl Burke was a total joke in this video.  She is wiggling all over the stage pretending she is auditioning for Dancing with the Stars (again) and never took time to explain the moves.  Judi kept with the theme of Jazzercise and her routines were fun and understandable.  Advice for Judi:  Don't partner with Cheryl Burke in any future video.  She added absolutely NOTHING to the exercise tape.  Let her stick to what she knows best - whatever that is!!,1422489600,,537,4.648936170212766
5105049,5,B007QYB3XQ,"I use a lot of dance videos for my work outs.  The jazzercise dance videos are in my top 2 favorites.  I know when I finish one that I know I've had a good workout - I'm sweating, I'm tired, and my pulse rate is up.  Plus, the group participation adds to the sense of fun.  There are a few things in this video that took me a little while to learn, but I could do most of the rest of it by the 4th or 5th time.",1420934400,,410,3.625
5105050,5,B007QYB3XQ,Good DVD.  The latin movements are good.  Ms. Missett doesn't do them as well as her partner but it gives you a good work out.  I was not diappointe.,1417996800,,149,4.068965517241379
5105051,3,B007QYB3XQ,"I feel the Burlesque workout is better. This moves really fast, does not explain the moves and is easy to overwork yourself. If you are not in good shape this is not recommended as it is not easy to slow down or modify for different fitness levels.",1415145600,,248,4.297872340425532
5105052,3,B007QYB3XQ,This was a fun hour of exercise. Cheryl did a great job teaching it. Not one I'd use every day,1403222400,,94,3.75
5105053,4,B007QYB3XQ,I have jazzercised for over twenty years and I love the routines in this session.  The music is great and Cheryl is an excellent teacher.  These routines are great to do at home for those days you miss going to the gym.,1401321600,5,219,4.190476190476191
5105054,5,B007QYB3XQ,"I received this DVD in record time (pun intended) and it is everything I had hoped.
Judi and cheryl will keep me moving when i can't get out to my Jazzercise class.
It's like new, it plays great and it's exactly what i wanted.  Thanks for being prompt,
honest and dependable.",1395705600,5,275,4.392156862745098
5105055,4,B007QYB3XQ,"Cheryl Burke is a nice surprise on this DVD. She really motivated me. I did miss the weight portion of Jazzercise we get in a regular class. I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who wants an at home extra ""class"". There is nothing like a true group class.",1394409600,,251,4.25
5105056,4,B007QYB3XQ,"So the music is great, the atmosphere makes you want to dance, and if you're familiar with Latin dance and Jazzercise, it's fun and relatively easy to follow. You end up feeling like you've gotten a workout and had a good time in the process (isn't that what it's all about?).

However...that being said, a couple of things to note.  First, it says the DVD is 77 min.  However, be aware that the ""chapters"" listed on the menu are really not different...the first one is the whole routine (about 45 min., I believe).  The second and third ones are just portions of the first one, not different ones at all (so why bother to repeat it again?).  In the age of DVD's, you can easily skip a dance segment, so why have chapters at all?

Second, Judy definitely sounds like she's making it up as she goes along.  Hmmm...let's throw in a move here.  After so many years of doing this, she should come off as being more clear in giving verbal instruction before the actual move is underway.  Her daughter is so much better at instructing (and clearly more fun to watch...sorry Judy!), hence why I also like the Burlesque one so much more.

All in all, not bad...",1392163200,5,1153,4.447619047619048
5105057,4,B007QYB3XQ,"Since I love dance and can't make it to jazz class every week, I purchased this DVD as an alternative jazz workout.  One thing I noticed IMMEDIATELY about this DVD is that the steps are very fast-paced.  I'm used to a more break-it-down, do-it-slowly type of workout to start, and THEN build up.  However, it's nothing that I can't adjust to with repetition and practice--just like in my regular dance class.  And the ladies' enthusiasm alone makes you want to keep going.  It's a party and a workout in your living room all at once. :)",1379635200,8,536,4.541666666666667
5105058,5,B007QYB3XQ,I love this video. Full of energy and fun! Easy to follow and will get your heart pumping! Would definitely recommend this product!,1367884800,,131,4.739130434782608
5105059,3,B007QYB3XQ,"I love Jazzercise, I attend classes weekly. I was looking for an at home alternative for the days/weeks when I can't go. This didn't quite do it for me. Judi Shepard Missett is awkward to watch. The routines are OK, but she doesn't seem comfortable in her own body. Cheryl Burke doesn't quite get the Jazzercise aspect of the dancing. She teaches steps, but they don't quite repeat and they are hard to follow.

I also ordered the Burlesque Jazzercise video which I liked much more than this one.",1364342400,17,496,4.573033707865169
8521113,5,B007QYB3XQ,This is a lot of fun. What's nice is the percussionist is there playing along with the prerecorded songs; also it's a big group of women doing with workout.,1516838400,,156,4.413793103448276

8521117,2,B007QYB3XQ,Wishing their was a Jazzercise video like the classes I attend. A good mix of stuff.,1482364800,,84,4.3125
8521118,3,B007QYB3XQ,"No complaints, it's an ""okay"" exercise video.",1470355200,,45,5.571428571428571
8521119,3,B007QYB3XQ,The routines are great except for when Chery is instructing. She does a poor job of explaining the steps.,1462320000,,105,4.578947368421052
8521120,5,B007QYB3XQ,Good dvd class .pretty much the same as regular jazzercise gym,1457654400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8521121,5,B007QYB3XQ,"Fun and enjoyable, this workout is an excellent addition to my exercise dvds.  It's entirely low impact, which I strongly prefer, and a great workout.",1457395200,,150,5.0
8521122,3,B007QYB3XQ,not bad not great,1449792000,,17,3.5
