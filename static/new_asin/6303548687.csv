684321,4,6303548687,"Time has been surprisingly kind to this 1995 Dean R Koontz adaptation about a man named Hatch (Jeff Goldblum) who doesn't survive a scary car crash unlike his wife Lindsey (Christine Lahti) and daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone) but is brought back after being brain dead for two hours by a doctor (Alfred Molina) using an experimental process that was tried once before with less than satisfactory results.  (We don't find out how unsatisfactory until late in the movie).

Almost as soon as Hatch is released he starts having vivid and violent nightmares of himself murdering young women, which he initially writes off as a side effect from the near-death experience.  But he sees a girl from his dreams on the news as a missing person and knows that she's dead.  After a couple of more incidents where he calls the police to report murders and no body is found the police and Hatch's wife both think he's going crazy but Hatch begins to believe he's somehow seeing through the eyes of a real flesh and blood killer.

Dean R Koontz adaptations have not been successful and movies like Watchers and Phantoms actually seem even worse now than they did when they originally came out.  So why is Hideaway the exception that seems better now?  Well there's the script by a pre-Seven Andrew Kevin Walker that is smarter and more playful than the source material.  There are the eccentric lead performances by Jeff Goldblum and Christina Lahti who have great chemistry together and seem determined to have as much fun as they can with the material.  There's a pre-Clueless Alicia Silverstone who is adorable and a young Jeremy Sisto who is a lot more effective than usual as the creepy serial killer.

Hideaway was directed by the not well-regarded Brett Leonard who was a big believer in computer effects before the advent of modern CGI--his most famous accomplishment is probably the Peter Gabriel Sledgehammer music video but he incorporated computer effects into his movies like The Lawnmower Man that look horribly dated now.  The computer effects don't look any less dated in Hideaway--you can see better computer animation in Android games--but since the effects are used to represent the afterlife and hell rather than something more tangible it's easier to give them a pass.

Watching Hideaway more than anything reminded me of how much I miss seeing Jeff Goldblum as a movie lead--he's the kind of naturally eccentric screen presence that Johnny Depp has been trying too hard to be over the past decade.  There is really nobody else exactly like Jeff Goldblum and it's a shame he isn't working more.

If you do watch Hideaway make sure you stay through the end credits--Hideaway unexpectedly has one of the most perfect and satisfying stinger scenes you are ever likely to see.",1435276800,3,2783,4.8936170212765955

684423,2,6303548687,"Hideaway really stinks.  Not even the beautiful Alicia Silverstone can save it.

It's about Alicia's character having to endure a car accident when her father carelessly hits a truck late at night, and the car spins off the road and off the side of a cliff.

From here Alicia barely escapes, but forced to stand around and witness her parents go off the cliff and supposedly watch her father die before her eyes, however the next day he wakes up in a hospital and apparently is perfectly fine.  His wife is especially surprised by this because she strongly believed that she JUST watched him die.

Anyway, the father becomes the main character of the movie as he gradually starts having dreams and visions of terrible events involving Alicia and another young daughter of his that died tragically when her bike accidentally drove in front of a moving car one horrible sunny day.  This incident has been haunting the father ever since it occurred.

It turns out a devil worshipper (or the devil himself- I never was sure) is the one responsible for the father having these terrible visions.  The devil doesn't like light either.  Hey that makes two of us!  Close the blinds and shut off the lamp!

The problem is that nothing suspenseful really happens.  I mean the father has these terrible visions and then runs around trying to make sure they don't become a reality by urgently realizing that he needs to protect his wife and kid but... he does nothing BUT run around, constantly!  If this is what's supposed to be considered suspense, then count me out- it doesn't work.

When the devil worshipper satanist weirdo and the father eventually meet... well this doesn't occur until the end of the movie.  Needless to say it's an exaggerated, unsatisfying way to wrap up a mediocre storyline.

The only time I'm ever really enticed by the story is when the father bleeds and cuts himself under unusual circumstances.  Reasons that nobody understands because the father himself apparently doesn't remember or understand it either.  It's all very confusing but when, for example, in one scene he's holding and squeezing a razor blade over the bathroom sink, this was by far the creepiest segment in the film.  It's also weird how the cuts are never very deep, giving way to the only suspense I can possibly discover through this pointless hogwash of a movie.

Overall, with no suspense, interesting plotline, or anything interesting at *all* occurring, it's hard to recommend it.  Only people who can't get enough of Alicia Silverstone would find something appealing about this, but you must be warned- she gradually falls out of the storyline as the film rolls along.  The father is clearly the main character here.",1335484800,3,2712,4.85

684509,2,6303548687,"Fans of Dean Koontz will know what I mean when I say he has created some incredibly memorable antagonists over his many years an author. Think Edgler Forman Vess from Intensity or Enoch Cain in From the Corner of His Eye. I initially watched this DVD simply because Jeremy Neybern/Vassago is one of the best characters Dean Koontz has ever penned.

I was not surprisingly dissapointed in this film, knowing already that Mr. Koontz himself had not behind behind the endeavor.

The really frustrating thing is, this could have been a fabulous film, had they been faithful to the novel, which was amazing! The movie lacked two things; the focus on the religious aspect (heaven vs. hell) and development of Vassago's character (which was deeply dealt with in the novel). Unlike many antagonists, Vassago was different, and the movie simply never made it clear to the viewers that this was the case.

The movie stars Jeff Goldbloom and Christine Lahti as Hatch and Lindsey Harrison, and the way their lives change after Hatch dies in a car wreck and is brought back from the dead by a surgeon, Jonas Neybern (played by Alfred Molina). When hatch comes back, he has brought something with him; namely the connection between himself and a sociopathic Satanist who calls himself Vassago (Jeremy Sisto). Vassago becomes obsessed with Hatch's daughter, Regina (Alicia Silverstone) and through a series of visions and contrived coincidences, the four are brought together in a final showdown in Vassago's lair under the rollercoaster at an abandoned amusement park.

I can't describe with enough detail how painfully I wished this movie would have stayed true to the book. Where they have stupid special effects, connecting the living and other worlds, they could have focused on the development of Jeremy/Vassago's character, his past, to give the viewer at least just a hint of how insane and complicated he truly was.

Where there was Regina, the whiny sixteen year old who wasted screen time (minus the scene in the club between Silverstone and Sisto the character really fell flat), there could have been a precious and precosious ten year old from the book.

Where there were poorly put together and awkwardly acted murder scenes and a stupid metal sculpture that Vassago had built, there could have been more thorough reasons for killing the young women and at least a nod to the macabre collection that Vassago housed in the basement of his hideaway.

Where there were stupid and contrived (as I've said) coincidences that brought Harrison and Vassago together, there could have been solid visions and a purposeful movement towards the final showdown.

The true grit in this book came from the character of Vassago and how he came to be who he was and how he became focused on both Linsday and Regina Harrison. The shock and sometimes chills came from the way Vassago's mind worked and the things he did while in the world of the living, so he could reenter hell. The movie lacked in showing anything like this.

A long time fan of Jeremy Sisto, I feel that he was given so little to work with from a character that could have been so profoundly frightening and shocking. And if this movie's Vassago was not engaging, there was no hope for the rest of the characters.

I don't recommend seeing this more than once, and once if you enjoy watching Goldbloom or Sisto.",1236902400,2,3362,4.851657940663176
684510,1,6303548687,"Wow, this was bad. And not bad in a ""Hard Rock Zombies"" kind of way, but bad in a ""wow...this is dull"" kind of way. The cast, consisting of usually enjoyable performers, is given nothing to work with here. All of the best elements to the Koontz novel are changed or left out. Alicia Silverstone just kind of mumbles her way through the flick, Jeff Goldblum doesn't get to play his usually fun type of character, the usual humor he brings to his roles is sorely missed, Alfred Molina gets what is basically an extended cameo walking around looking upset during his total of 7 minutes of screentime, and Christine Lahti's character is so different from the character in the Koontz novel, you hate to see her wasted here. Jeremy Sisto is the only bright spot, but even he can't do much with what he is given in the lousy script.
The special effects are awful!! Who knew that when we enter the afterlife we are basically cigarette smoke with a face? The computer animation is laughable, Heaven & Hell never looked so boring!

Even the special effects are bad. It is so bad that Dean Koontz tried to disassociate himself from the film, with good reason.

The basic premise of the movie has to do with a family man (Jeff Goldblum), who dies in an accident and is brought back to life through the extraordinary intervention of a doctor (Alfred Molina). Though the doctor's efforts appeared at first blush to have been successful, our family man now seems to be psychically linked to someone else, a psycopathic killer who happens to be a satanist. Of course, it turns out that this killer was also brought back from the dead by the very same doctor. What happens next is too stupid for words. Save your money.

684515,1,6303548687,"With the name Alfred Molina, a distiguished actor from scores of films and such films as Chocolate and Spiderman 2, you would think that n e movie is worth watching with him in it. Well this isn't one of those films. Films like this inspire you to never want to watch a book to movie adaptation of Dean Koontz. His books are abused more then any author i have seen. This one was bad enough he wanted his name off of it. You know its bad when the author of the book wants nothing to do with it. But ill give a rundown of the movie because im watching it right now to make it a more detailed review.

The start of the film starts off promising and makes the viewer think(if they have read the book first) that its going to follow the story line close enough to keep the spiritual core in place. But i found myself drifting once they showed the horrible special effects of what was supposed to be hell. After that it was all downhill. Now the fault lies not with the actors although there is a lot of overacting to be had. The fault is the script adaptation. The lines are beyond ridiculus and are hardly believeable especially when overacted, like a memorable scene where hatch is speeding home and seeing through the psychic link the killer nabbing his daughter. The look alone betrays how badly the script was written and the director is clearly inept to direct anything and should be forbidden to make any more movies.

 Explaining the synopsis is a plain waste of time because the book is butchered beyond recognition. But ill move on to the descrepincies between book and movie, which are numerous in number.
1. According to the movie, Hatch and Lindsey had 2 daughters. One was killed in a car wreck and the other is Regina. The readers of the book will realize they subsituted the 10 yr bright Regina for a 16 yr old snotty and spoiled version. I myself had wanted to see the Regina from the book brought to life but sadly this is not the case.
2. The movie has Hatch see a psychic, who apparently has precognitive powers. The movie is almost given away at the exact moment Hatch walked through the door. This is a fabricated moment because this never took place in the book.
3. The grotesque tableau of dead bodies in the book are gruesomely detailed and show the psychotic serial killer at work. But the movie completely changes it. Instead of the bodies being his art, a giant steel gaping monster is the centerpiece and isn't that frightening at all. You don't get the sense of a unique killer. He seems run of the mill psycho.
4. Dr. Jona is the father of this killer but in the movie he dies by his hand. The book is a great deal different in that he has little role in the actual events of the book but has a minor role. He quits his right  job and becomes a vet.
All in all this movie is a waste and im losing braincells watching it right now. Im going to use it as a coaster. Its more entertaining then watching it.",1132876800,3,2929,4.32
684516,3,6303548687,"It's reported that Dean Koontz, who wrote the bestseller upon which this film is based, begged the producers to take his name off the opening credits--he was that disappointed.  Having read and enjoyed the book much more than this film version, I can understand why.  The screenwriters opted to focus on Patch's deceased daughter rather than the spiritual forces that propelled the novel's plot.  Jeremy Sisto was also seriously miscast as the villain, appearing much too effeminate and non-threatening as compared to the book's bad guy.  Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone and Alfred Molina do okay, but they are overcome by the writer's ineffectiveness.  The special effects are rather banal as well, but you may find yourself immersed in the film's atmospheric setting.  Just should have been much better.",1132358400,,824,5.3

Jeff plays a father with a head trip-he died and came back-saw his deceased daughter on the way.  Jeff is very good in these roles but this is a little far fetched.  The serial killer part is cool but the connection is a little off.  The ending is very predictable and you wonder why you watched the movie in the first place.

684518,3,6303548687,"I have to say, I was fairly underwhelmed by this film.  I have not read the book, but I have a feeling that it is much better than this.

Even with all the short comings the movie is decent, but it has some major flaws.  For starters, the direction is horrid.  The film seems flat, and almost made for TV at times.  There is no tightness, nothing close.  That hurts the movie a great deal, because the lack of any claustrophobia cuts the tension down immensly.  There is only a few short moments where there are any real scares (the begining, and a few of the Sisto in the shower moments), but other than that there is hardly anything here to really scare the audience.  The second problem is how the movie seems to glaze over some of the more violent aspects.  Yes, there are on screen murders, but they are so tame that the horror of the moment is lost.  It all feels very by the numbers as well.  The final problem is the acting.  Everyone here seems to be trying, but the script gives them very little to work with at times, and because of this, the acting is very on and off.  Jeremy Sisto suffers the most in this area.  His performances goes from dark and menacing to horridly over the top, and almost pushes this entire affair in to B-movie territory.  Jeff Goldblum suffers from the same problem.  Christine Lahti has some nice moments, especially towards the end while she is fighting Jeremy, but she also slips in to some over acting.  Alicia Silverstone is there, and not much else.  She really has no character or than the hostage.  The rest of the cast is fine.

The movie does have some very interesting set designs, and the story does have it's cool moments (although those moments are hurt by the very blah pacing).

Now, the movie is far from horrible.  It is entertaining to a degree, and has some very interesting sequences (the hell and heaven stuff does look horribly dated due to the reliance on computer graphics though). Also, it is always fun to see some fairly well known actors in a fairly cheesy horror movie.  I would recommend renting it, and if you can find the DVD or VHS for really cheap, then grab it.  Otherwise, this one can warrant a miss.",1101686400,5,2177,4.4120603015075375

684580,3,6303548687,"The 1995 film ""Hideaway"" was adapted from a novel written by Dean Koontz. As much as I enjoy reading horror novels, along with books from many other genres, I usually avoid Dean Koontz. I attempted to read ""Mr. Murder"" several years ago and failed to finish it. I finally got through one Koontz book, the highly readable and thoroughly enjoyable ""Phantoms,"" roughly a year ago. As good as that book was, I still cannot bring myself to read another of his novels. Like the other author often mentioned in the same breath, Stephen King, many of Dean Koontz's books have found their way to the silver screen. And, like King, most of them tank immediately. This author does not have the track record King has. At least the Maine writer can point to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Carrie"" as proof that a few of his books succeeded in the difficult transition to film. Koontz, as far as I am aware of, cannot make the same claim. While ""Hideaway"" is not a truly awful picture, it is not a particularly great one either. I seem to recall it disappeared quickly from the theaters, doomed to perpetual existence in the gloomier shadows at the video store.
""Hideaway"" is the story of the Harrison family. Patriarch Hatch (Jeff Goldblum), mother Lindsey (Christine Lahti), and daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone) seem to encounter the typical problems all small families go through. Regina is at that age where she is a bit rebellious and whiny, but she is generally a good enough kid. Hatch and Lindsey seem to have a good careers as owners of some sort of antique store/ art gallery, careers that, if the movie is any indication, require about one hour of work a week. Tragedy strikes the Harrison family on a trip down a winding mountain road when Hatch swerves to avoid a truck. The car teeters on the edge of a sharp incline just long enough for Regina to exit the vehicle. Then the automobile bounces down the slope and splashes into a cold river. Hatch and Lindsey struggle to stay alive, but it is not enough. Lindsey, despite her best efforts, fails to keep Hatch breathing. By the time the couple arrives at the hospital, Hatch Harrison has been walking in the land of shadows for nearly two hours. Doctor Jonas Nyeburn (Alfred Molina) decides to rescuitate Goldblum's character and succeeds. Hatch goes home with his concerned family to continue living his life. But something changed in Harrison during the time he was gone. He claims he saw his deceased daughter on ""the other side.""
What's worse, he brought something back, a horrible power to see through the eyes of a serial killer preying on the city's youth. Hatch not only catches an occasional glimpse of terrible activities, he sometimes suffers the same sorts of physical injuries the killer does. A newspaper account of a heinous crime confirms one of Harrison's visions. Lindsey and Regina are in the dark about what is really going on, although Lindsey sees enough weirdness to insist on taking her husband back to Nyeburn for a check up. The doctor insists nothing is wrong, sort of, and Hatch once again tries to live his life. Once again, the disturbing visions return. Harrison gives into them fully this time, heading out in the car to try and find the guy, calling the police to report a murder he saw in a vision, and generally reducing Lindsey to a nervous wreck. Things take a turn for the worse when Hatch realizes the murderer, a young guy by the name of Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), is setting his sights on Regina. The rest of the film becomes a race to discover the location of Vassago in time to save Regina from disaster. Rae Dawn Chong shows up briefly as a nutty new age type named Rose Orwette, an incense burning and Tarot card reading gal who wants to help Goldblum's character locate this monster. The conclusion alternates between genuine suspense and unfettered cheesiness. The requisite plot revelation unfolds in the final minutes too.
As I watched ""Hideaway,"" I could not help thinking how many times we have seen this type of movie before. Director Brett Leonard (""Lawnmower Man,"" ""Virtuosity"") falls back on the use of early computer animation effects in several scenes to show what the afterlife looks like. Didn't we see this in ""Brainstorm""? Too, Vassago as a serial killer with his own creepy lair isn't that original considering movies from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Silence of the Lambs"" have done essentially the same thing. As for the acting, my girlfriend and I both thought Jeff Goldblum too weird for the role of Hatch Harrison. Don't get me wrong; Goldblum is remarkably restrained in his performance, but a restrained Jeff Goldblum is still weirder than ninety percent of the actors out there. Christine Lahti, for her part, gets little to do from the script except act concerned about her husband's increasing paranoia. Alicia Silverstone is, well, Alicia Silverstone. The best performance comes from Jeremy Sisto as Vassago, especially in those introductory scenes where he terrorizes his family. It's nice to see this actor in an early role before he went on to ""May"" and ""Wrong Turn.""
Extras on the disc include a featurette about the making of the film, a trailer, and an alternate ending that, while interesting, does not add much to the ultimate meaning of the film. I cannot conclude that ""Hideaway"" is a particularly bad film. It's not even close, in fact. I would consider it an average thriller, not really a horror film but not a science fiction picture either. Give it a shot if you like this sort of thing. Goldblum completists will of course wish to procure a copy. I'm just glad I rented it.",1087257600,3,5618,4.768993839835729
684581,3,6303548687,"Better than what I was expecting, Goldblum is always on top form no matter what the movie. This film is severly creepy, although the computer effects are quite rubbish the film is saved by good acting and a heavy metal soundtrack.

684582,3,6303548687,"I felt that although the book Hideway was ten times better than the movie,the movie had an originality of it's own.  But,the book and the movie differ a lot.  First of all Hatch played by Goldblum is a 5'9 160 pd. man.  Goldblum on the other hand is 6'3 200 pds. Although some say this was a minor factor in the movies turnout, it was not in my eyes. No offense to Goldblum but he is better in comedic roles and playing human flies.  Also in the book Regina was not a 16 year old ditsy blonde,  she was an intelligent redheaded ten year old girl w/a physical handicap. HAHAHa.  I think Silverstone could have played that part well. Yeah right, ""as if"".  And last but not least Jeremy Sisto... Lets just say he was the best part of the whole movie.  He is how I envisioned the killer tall,dark, and handsome.  And there is something about his voice that is charming yet dangerously chilling to the bone.  There are a few things that would have made the movie a bit better, maybe if the imagery was had more spice and also better portrayals of the roles.  Although Goldblum and Silverstone are good actors in there own way they have proved that they can not be seen in a thriller.",1061769600,,1178,4.3090909090909095
684583,3,6303548687,"This could have been a really incredible movie. The Book was very suspensful and had a lot of fantastic imagery that would have played well on the screen.
The film version of this story fell VERY SHORT!
It wasn't the casting or the script...I was disappointed in the plot elimates that were dropped from the Book Version.
The Film opens with the Living Room Scene of Jeremy's Mother and Sister posed in Prayer Positions. I kept hoping they would show the poses for the other victims as well (like they do in the book)...THIS WAS MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT with the film version.
Maybe I should have seen the movie first?
And then read the book?",1025308800,3,641,4.582608695652174
684584,3,6303548687,"Well this has a nice cast with Goldblerg and Silverstone.  The story is about a man who dies and then is brought back to life, but the thing is he hasn't come back alone.  He is spiritually connected with a killer.  I wouldn't like to say more cause there are many twists and turns.  This is a movie that will keep you at the edge of your seet.",1024444800,,344,4.014705882352941
684585,2,6303548687,"Dean Koontz tried to get his name taken off this adaptation of one of his novels, and with good reason.
Goldblum is Hatch, who is killed in a car accident. He is revived by Alfred Molina, but he begins to ""change,"" much to the consternation of his wife Christine Lahti and gum smacking dummy teen daughter Alicia Silverstone. Apparently, Hatch has made some kind of connection with a serial killer (played by Jeremy Sisto), and both men can see what the other is doing. Sisto becomes obsessed with Silverstone, and Goldblum and the killer run around the Pacific Northwest chasing each other until they meet up in a clicheed finale.
This film should have been better than this. Goldblum is all wrong as Hatch Harrison, playing him with wide eyed wonder and laid back charm. He never gets overly concerned that he can see what a serial killer sees, and when he does explode into anger or emotion, it comes off as supremely fake. Lahti is given nothing more to do than follow a sweaty Goldblum around the house asking him what is wrong. Molina is equally unimpressive as the doctor who serves as the connection between the two men. Sisto is good as the killer, but he is not given anything different to do. You have seen this serial killer a hundred times before. Rae Dawn Chong, as a psychic, has two whole scenes before getting dispatched, and she was the most interesting character here. Once again, I ask the eternal question of all psychic characters in these films: ""If they are psychic, can't they see that they are about to die?""
Alicia Silverstone is another matter. I cannot become enamored of a person through a couple of music video appearances. Here, she plays a sixteen or seventeen year old as if she was twelve. Half the time I was not concerned for her safety, I just wanted to smack her. What has she done since ""Clueless""? That list alone is scarier than anything in this film.
In a car accident near the beginning of the film, a truck sideswipes our heroic family. Lahti and Goldblum are bug eyed and screaming, but you can see Silverstone in the back seat SMILING. Did she get away with this? Did editing not see this? Is a spinning car on a wet highway supposed to be funny to her character? The car ends up over on the shoulder of the road, Silverstone pops out (pouting), and then the car rolls back down a ravine and ends up in a river. Now, I see why Alicia was smiling, the scene is unintentionally hilarious. I expected the Road Runner to swim up and deposit some dynamite-laced bird seed in the car as Goldblum and Lahti headed for some rapids or a tall desert cliff. If you can remember how Dead Meat bought it in ""Hot Shots,"" this is just as silly.
Leonard also makes liberal use of computer effects to show us what heaven and hell look like. Hell is a giant orange ball of goo. I think heaven is a blue tinged Oriental lady, I may be wrong. Leonard decided ""The Lawnmower Man"" had some good ideas not entirely fleshed out in his two and a half hour director's cut, and he stuck them in here for no real reason.
Eventually, the viewer will become as listless as the cast. Whole scenes go by with little or no energy. Major plot points are not revealed by any intelligence on the characters' part, but based on coincidence (watch for Hatch's discovery of the motel the killer is staying at: HE HAPPENS TO DRIVE BY IT). By the time the completely silly resolution rolls around, you will not care. As one last stab at the audience's interest, stay tuned after the final credits, where Leonard tacks on some cheesy scenes that the producers of ""Bloody Murder"" probably would have rejected as old. Hide away from ""Hideaway.""

God vs Satan ,ala ""Prophecy"", is the main theme and I find these tales to be entertaining.  Hideaway will not knock your socks off with a an ever-twisting story arc but what it does have is a solid core plot, coupled together with above-average acting, and special effects that will move you.  That last comment seems to be up for debate, some have called the effects ""hoaky"" and stated they ruined the movie.  I disagree.  You'll have to check it out for yourself.

684588,1,6303548687,"Despite a stellar cast, Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Alicia Silverstone, and Alfred Molina, who do their best with a really bad script based on the Dean Koontz novel of the same name, this movie is a stinker. Even the special effects are bad. It is so bad that Dean Koontz tried to disassociate himself from the film, with good reason.

The basic premise of the movie has to do with a family man (Jeff Goldblum), who dies in an accident and is brought back to life through the extraordinary intervention of a doctor (Alfred Molina). Though the doctor's efforts appeared at first blush to have been successful, our family man now seems to be psychically linked to someone else, a psycopathic killer who happens to be a satanist. Of course, it turns out that this killer was also brought back from the dead by the very same doctor. What happens next is too stupid for words. Save your money.

Okay, so there are a few differences between this film and Stephen King's 'The Dead Zone', the main one being tension. 'Hideaway', based on a faintly supernatural thriller by Dean Koontz (the poor man's Stephen King), lacks...something, although what it lacks in suspense it makes up for in wasted talent. Christine Lahti's character brief appears to have been 'wet, simpering fishwife' while Alicia Silverstone does her usual spoilt American teen-type with annoyingly stretched eyes, as though eye-widening were the only way to portray naivete. Jeff Goldblum makes the best of a cliched and often stilted script, but even an actor of his talent and professionalism (let's face it, the man's made some stinkers in his time) can't conceal downright discomfort and regret when it comes to retreading old straight-to-video-thriller ground. But it's not all bad. Even with young Jeremy Sisto (or whatever his name is) trying his best to steal the show, Goldblum's truly wry spirit helps make this film watchable.",973209600,,1150,5.221621621621622

The movie would have beenloads better without the cheap, totally gratuitous special effects. But I greatly enjoyed the heavy soundtrack ( although I couldn't help taking a little offense at the overused stereotype that killers always listen to metal.  What about all the drive-by shooters who listen to rap? But I digress) Unbelievably predictable plotwise, but I could never have foreseen the utter creepiness of Jeremy Sisto in this role as Vassago. And seductive as well, he has a startling range for such a young actor. Looking spookily sexy in trenchcoat and leather, Vassago could easily pass for a seriously psychotic ""Lost Boy"". Truth to tell,if he had used those eyes and that voice on me, I would have gone with him to a terrible fate. A must for Jeremy Sisto fans!",941932800,12,871,4.885135135135135

It is the kind of movie  that makes you think and wonder, and even  interpet. It goes along the lines of  Stephen  King's ""Thinner,"" and every David Cronenberg  film.  The movie doesn't even play on the  stereo-typical juandra of your good  guy vs.  bad guy kind of movie. Instead you have both  sides connected  with eachother, and then  battle to become seperate in order to preserve  both the truth and lie, before they become  interwined completely causing  chaos.  Also, I like to point out is, it is not your typical  horror  movie about a boyfriend out to rescue  his girlfriend from the monster or  bad guy.  Instead the horror takes place within a loving  family, whom  must battle together to destroy  whatever evil has entered their lives. The  hero  of the film is a father and husband who goes  out of his way to  rescue his family, and that  realy tells a lot. It presents the idea of a  father  being heroic and nobel in the face of evil. How  often do you see  that?  Cheers!  Rebbecca McGarity",937008000,2,1128,4.4874371859296485

Unfortunately, the  ending turns into your standard, typical good against evil fight with some  really goofy effects, in my opinion.  And as for Jeremy Sisto?  He can tie  me up anytime!
