8751009,5,B01BPK82FS,"I found this at a brick & mortar store in the bargain bin, all 3 seasons for $4.95. I was not familiar with the show at all but the premise sounded promising. LOVE IT! Quirky characters, off the wall humor and hilarious situations. This is far superior to many of the poor comedies that currently populate the prime time commercial networks and/or cable. The entire cast is superb and gifted performers. I was sorry when I had finished watching all 21 episodes because I wanted more! This is a series I will watch more than once. Delightful!",1521072000,2,541,4.587628865979381

Having worked in one for over 11 years...I can't tell you how much of this art imitates life!  Very cute and recommended for some genuine laughs.
