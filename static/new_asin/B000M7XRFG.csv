BACKYARD GOLF was recommended to me by one of my golf buddies after I had noticed some improvement in his game. I viewed this video and followed the excellent instruction. The brilliance of the this video is the simplicity the way it conveys the golf instruction integrating it in some great drills. Not only have I seen my golf game improve, but my attitude to make difficult shots has changed from negative to positive. This is a wonderful program recommended for the weekend golfer as well as serious players.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1245542400,8,604,4.761904761904762
8166941,1,B000M7XRFG,"As another reviewer stated, the 5 star reviewers are trying to sell the product.  I checked ""see all my reviews"" for the first few reviewers and lo and behold they gave 5 star reviews to ALL KINDS of instructional sports videos including basketball, hockey, lacrosse, baseball, coaching and on and on.  Either these guys work for these companies in some capacity, or they've never met a product they didn't (5 star) love.  Shame.  I use reviews ALL THE TIME to make decisions, now I guess I have to research the reviewers before  I can believe them. Dang.",1360540800,2,555,4.680412371134021
8166942,1,B000M7XRFG,"What is Amazon's role in at least making some attempt to verify these reviews as legit? It's obvious from looking at the reviews and the reviewers' other reviews that they were done by the producers of this series. Shame on the producer/director, and on Amazon.
I'd think twice about buying anything from Amazon based on reviews, after seeing this.",1343779200,3,348,4.915254237288136
8166943,5,B000M7XRFG,"Highly recommend it for beginners (like myself) or any golfer struggling with their game, the drills are excellent and will definitely improve your game.  The videos are very easy to follow and its not overloaded with details which was perfect for a beginner like me.  I would recommend using a highly lofteb club such as a lob or sand wedge (which I think the instructor recommends)so you can practice your full swing and also some plastic or foam partice balls.  The videos also gets into putting, which I haven't done since I don't have a putting green in my backyard.",1281916800,2,571,4.69

He swings. The ball is heading toward the hole. It veers left.
Now the ball comes back. It's going going going.....HE MADE IT!

This is a superb collection of instructions, tips and lessons. I have personally benefited from the BACKYARD GOLF video implementing the techniques at practice and in competition.
