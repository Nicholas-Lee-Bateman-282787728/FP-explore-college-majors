8122360,1,B000FGFBTO,"The cinematic genre of Suspense includes a large sub-category involving the threat of time bombs, predominantly in latter years following the inception of digital technology, audiences generally being teased with an initially seen display of hours recorded upon an explosive device that most often dwindles to a mere second or two, whereupon a near-miraculous rescue of some type will be accomplished.  Few sensate viewers will feel any moments of suspense, however, since an explosion would naturally terminate the film at once.  This production, after a promising beginning, descends into the domain of the hackneyed.  Its setting is Seattle (played here by British Columbia, with additional stock footage of the region about the Washington metropolis) as Dan Carlin (Stephen Collins) a wealthy building contractor and recent widower, is not able to alter his intense working habits so as to spend an increased amount of time with his young son Marcus (Emmett Shoemaker), with a result that an attempt is made by a carpenter hired by Carlin to work in his home, Alex Redman (Rick Roberts) to encroach as a surrogate father for the lad, an indiscreet act as both Dan's governess and his cook easily apprehend.  After Marcus is kidnapped for ransom, the film's effective moments are at a close due to the entry into the story of local police and FBI agents.  Along with some inappropriate casting of law enforcement personnel, investigative procedures used by these individuals are far afield from reality, notably in relation to Carlin, who apparently possesses a form of dynamic energy that compels various arms of the law to follow him about in puppylike fashion.  In spite of totally off-putting elements within the scenario, strong performances are turned in by several members of the cast, with Rick Roberts capturing acting laurels as an enigmatic Alex.  A Direct Source DVD includes no extra features but does provide fine visuals and excellent Dolby Digital sound reproduction.",1175990400,,1986,5.226415094339623
