8328573,5,B000NPGLS2,"I have used these videos in my science classroom for 7 years.  I love the Tracking Speed - it is the best video on speed verses acceleration.  The students love it.  There are a few series that this group has made.  They are really inexpensive but have become hard to find.  When I got mine, you could contact ESPN Sports Figures and they send you a lab book for free-great stuff!",1285113600,,380,4.295774647887324
8328574,4,B000NPGLS2,"I used these videos for a special middle/high school course I taught called the Mathematics of Sports.  The videos are great.  Some of my older students thought a couple of the videos were cheesy (my students were in grades 7th-10th).  Overall, they are a wonderful set of videos that help relate science and math to sports.",1235865600,,324,4.75
8328575,5,B000NPGLS2,"I've used this video set in science classes for several years.  It's an excellent set, geared toward 6-9 graders. It presents an superb conceptual picture of speed, momentum, friction forces, projectile motion, and form drag to name a few.  The information is accurate, and presented in a fun format using kids and professional athletes.  I'd recommend it for any science classroom!",1199750400,,382,5.229508196721311
