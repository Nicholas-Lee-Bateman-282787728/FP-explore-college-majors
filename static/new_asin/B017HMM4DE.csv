8739247,1,B017HMM4DE,This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. I actually looked to see if there was an option to get a refund after renting this stinker. I have never done that before. This movie is NOT HORROR!!!!!! There isn't a single horror element in it. It is nothing more than terrible actors having boring conversations in deadpan voices for an hour and a half. The final 40 minutes is just the actors talking about Jesus and reading the bible out loud. Nothing happens.,1476316800,2,461,4.5
8739248,2,B017HMM4DE,"Nadine (Erin Russ) has a fairly easy life, laying around nude while guys take Polaroids of her. She gets her drugs and all is well until she goes beyond the norm and now she is back at home with an overly religious mother who believes her daughter is possessed. She spends her last dime on a donation to eliminate a demon or two in Nadine who is faking it.

The film was low budget with background noise in the film. David Yow as the preacher was not convincing and had scenes that lasted way to long with boring religious talk. Erin Russ had a grown Wednesday Addams (Lisa Loring) look to her. The opening starts off with a bang, with erotic scenes and then dies.

2 stars for the nudity

8739254,3,B017HMM4DE,"It says, ""bleak and raw"" on the cover of this, and that's pretty accurate....This film really shows you how messed up people in this world can be....Now, there isn't much happening here other than some very long dialogue by the Preacher, which will make you feel like your sitting through a hellfire and brimstone sermon...Maybe that's why the director has such a goofy name, I don't know, I didn't look up anything about the filmmakers and I don't intend to...I'm not going to talk about the plot, because there really isn't one...just the anti-Christian message that the title suggests...I gave it three stars because I didn't hate it, but didn't really like it either..If you like watching disturbing movies then you might like this, otherwise, stay away...It has some topless nudity, a little foul and suggestive language, and really no gore to speak of for you horror hounds, other than a couple of torture scenes, that are done fairly well for this type of movie.",1456617600,11,969,4.878787878787879
