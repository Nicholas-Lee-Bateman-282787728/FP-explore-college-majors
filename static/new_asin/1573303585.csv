191083,3,1573303585,"I really like the moves in this video.  I feel that I get a good cardio workout in a short amount of time.  The time goes by really quickly.  It helps that the second half is broken down into 4 blocks, so you know that  once you get to the third block it's downhill from there.  The only  annoying thing about the video, and it is VERY annoying, is that the  constant woowooing and come on y'alls that you hear are actually samples  repeating over and over!  Next time I do it, I'm going to count how many  times I hear the same ""come on y'all"" and the same ""go Kathy  go, woo!""  The exercisers are equipped with microphones, but you  rarely see their lips move. The most annoying sample is the ""uh  huh"".  I hope Kathy reads this and seriously considers never using the  samples again!",938476800,11,786,4.244897959183674
191084,4,1573303585,"I am pretty new to regular home exercise and really like Kathy Smith's approach. Took me a couple of tries to get the moves down - some I'm still working on, but it's a great workout! Highly recommend it. However, I'm  still looking for a good cool down/stretch workout to add after the aerobic  section. Recommendations anyone?",921628800,2,328,4.7368421052631575
191085,5,1573303585,I enjoy most of Kathy Smith's exercise videos.  Timesaver Cardio Fat Burner has been one of my favorites.  It's fun and upbeat.,1244160000,,127,4.7272727272727275
191086,5,1573303585,"I recently bought this dvd. It is possibly the best ""20 minute"" workout...ever. If you want a vigorous, short workout, this is it.",1236643200,,130,4.695652173913044
191087,4,1573303585,"This was a pretty good workout.  I have been exercising 6 days a week for about 13 years.  I feel like I got a good workout, worked up a sweat etc.
There are many confusing moves but I would not let that stop me from sticking to it.  Generally if something has tricky moves, it takes me 2 or 3 times to do the workout and once I get them down, its easy to keep up.  I just got this one and have not done it enough times to get them down perfectly, but even so I got a great workout from it.
To contrast, Denise Austins moves are much easier to follow (and makes it easier to just focus on getting a workout rather than trying to keep up with different steps)  So I'd save my Denise Austin and Gilad workouts for days when I just want to get in a good workout and not have to think too much about it.  I'd use this dvd for days when I might want to have a little bit more fun...if that makes sense.",1230076800,,897,3.8743169398907105
191088,1,1573303585,"Although I did break into a sweat, I didn't enjoy this dvd.  The movements did not match the timing of the music.  Very frustrating.  The moves are a little tricky for beginners.",1201564800,,178,4.5
191089,4,1573303585,"I really like Kathy Smith, even though she is always letting out cheesy hoots and squeals.  (It gives me something to make fun of when I workout.) I like this DVD because I can do either or both sections and still get a good workout.  On days when I only do one, I still have time to follow up with a Lotte Berk Method DVD for toning.  I didn't have a problem following the steps and there aren't many moves that ""form"" needs to be demonstrated on.

The second workout is good, but its hard to follow the modifiers.  They don't show many clear shots of them.  Going off of what Kathy says and the weird camera angles, don't expect to get the modifications perfectly the first time through.  I had to stop and watch and then join back in.",1198972800,,737,4.2214285714285715
191090,5,1573303585,"If I *did* like aerobics a little more, I would do this workout every day. It's high-energy and very speedy, and I've liked Kathy Smith as a leader since I watched my mom do her tapes when I was little. When I do this workout for a few weeks, I see the difference. Recommended.",1179100800,,277,4.148148148148148
191091,4,1573303585,"I love Kathy's energy even if she is a touch hokey at times. This DVD is really not 2 workouts. It's one 20-minute workout that you have an option of adding another 20 minutes to. The 2nd 20-minute workout starts at too fast of a tempo to be considered a workout on its own (in other words, have even 1-2 minutes of a warm-up because there isn't one). Neither workout has a cool-down at all, disappointing. The cuing is a little behind but I love that the choreography is continually building and you don't have an opportunity to get bored. Good workout once you figure out what's going on.",1175990400,,590,4.422018348623853
191092,3,1573303585,Check your age at the door. This is good if you are 20-30 years old. Me? Hey I'm over the hill and need something slower.,1175040000,,121,3.88
191093,3,1573303585,"Maybe the problem is that I am not exceptionally coordinated, but I still have a hard time with this workout even after owning it for 2 years.  It has a lot of hip hop type dance moves that I just can't seem to master.  The editing is also not helpful, as it cuts away from up close shots just before they do the more compliccated moves.  Also, the probably 15 or 20 people working out in this dvd are constantly hooping and hollering making it seem like part work out, part charismatic prayer meeting.  The run time is more like 25 minutes than 20 and once you add on the stretch you're well over half an hour.  This would probably be great for someone who really likes dancing in night clubs or something but I really didn't like it.",1171152000,,735,4.258992805755396
191094,4,1573303585,"I got bored with these workouts fairly quickly, BUT they are good if you need a quick workout. You can either do one of the 20-minute workouts, or combine them for a more intense workout.",1170460800,,187,4.371428571428571
191095,1,1573303585,"I try not to judge my vids the first time I do them because the bulk of my fitness dvd collection (which is very large) are comprised of ones that took some getting used to, but that I ended up loving.  This was not one of them - I have given this one 5 chances, and I still dislike it VERY much.  The set is SO cheesy, and so is Kathy.  Unfortunately, this is my first Kathy video - I have heard she has some good ones, but I am completely turned off by her and will not purchase another.  The timing was off, and even after I mastered the steps, they did not feel effective.  Sorry Kathy, I am looking elsewhere.",1163376000,,614,4.0
191096,3,1573303585,"Though I'm not completely unhappy with this video, it rarely gets picked (and I usually work out twice a day to an assortment of videos).  There are too many people on the set with Kathy, which makes it difficult to focus on a modifier.  Since I have a slight issue with a knee, I usually like to start high-energy aerobic videos with the modifier until I become familiar with the routine.  I also don't like that the cast members can be heard almost as much as Kathy - it's distracting when trying to learn a new and fast-paced routine.  So, even though I think I may enjoy the workout eventually (if I actually pick it, that is), if I want a fun, sweaty workout I stick with Mari Winsor's ""Fat Burning"" sequence from her ""Maximum Burn Basics/Fat Burning"" DVD, which I purchased around the same time - Mari is much better at talking to her modifier the entire time, and even though she has about the same number of people on set with her, it doesn't hinder the workout.",1154908800,,970,4.402234636871508
191097,4,1573303585,"At first, I didn't really like this DVD because of its cheesiness. But once I got over it, the workout is really fun to do. These last month or two, I have been doing aerobics using multiple exercise DVDs, and so far this is one of my favorites. After doing the exercise for 3x a week for several weeks, I can feel my body to build more tone.

In summary, here are some of the positives and negatives of the DVD:

Positive
* It will get your heart rate up!
* The moves are fun to follow. If you haven't done any aerobics before, then it might take you multiple sessions to be able to follow them all. If you have done some aerobics, then there should be no new moves to learn, as the moves in the dvd are already widely used in regular cardio classes.
* The DVD contains two 20-minutes cardio workout (so you can do one or both - depends on how much time you have). It also includes a section on cooling down & stretching (which is nice) and a section on snacking.
* The music is okay. It's not great, but it's quite motivating. I've seen a lot worse.

Negative
* In one of the repeats of combination moves, Kathy confuses herself & does the wrong move. Instead of editing the dvd, she just continues to record it & give it to us. It is perfectly fine on regular classes, but on DVD, you are supposed to replay the exact same instructions so you are bound to see the same mistake again and again, which breaks the flow of the move a little.
* Kathy doesn't say the correct forms of the body in doing the moves. You should get another DVD, such as Christi Taylor's solid gold cardio, if you want to know the correct form of doing lunges, etc.
* Her cheers sounds like 80is or 90ish and a bit cheesy. The last time I use the dvd I turn down the volume so that my neighbors can't hear her cheers :)",1154476800,,1795,4.122857142857143
191098,1,1573303585,This was really bad.  The dancing was cheesy and Kathy was cheesy.  The moves don't seem to match the beat of the music and I really didn't feel like I got a good cardio workout.  You have to focus so much of your energy on doing the crazy moves that you can't focus on your workout.  It really wasn't worth the money.  I would reccomend some of the Self videos.  They are easier to follow and I feel like I get a better workout with them.,1145145600,4,439,4.046511627906977
191099,1,1573303585,"I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one.",1144540800,4,542,4.323529411764706
191100,3,1573303585,"This tape is one of my least favorite Kathy tapes and I rarely use it now.  The moves are more showy than her other workouts and that is not a good thing.  It is pretty easy to learn after a few times but the moves are still more complex than her other tapes. Bottom line: I don't feel like I am getting the best workout for my time and with what little time we all have, I recommend her Peak Fat Burning tape.",1141171200,5,410,3.927710843373494
191101,3,1573303585,"I purchased this DVD with Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning. Both had many excellent reviews.

Kathy's routines are above all, fun. The ""compounding"" nature, which results in a routine of an ideal length. The 20-minute split is helpful - there is really no excuse for not doing at least one of the routines.

I must say though, that these routines are a little bit more difficult then the others I have seen from her.  The moves themselves are easy, but the transitions I found difficult. I don't consider myself much more than a beginner, but I would say that I am fairly co-ordinated. I do know I will pick them up in time.

The only other thing that was a little peculiar was the sort of ""whoop it up"" atmosphere, cheering from the group. Found it a little cheezy.  But, truth be told, it gives it personality. I'm glad I added it to my collection.",1130630400,5,851,4.464516129032258
191102,4,1573303585,"I enjoyed this exercise DVD, the only problem I had was learning the moves, they are not easy but with practice I think I can get them!  It does work you and makes you sweat.",1124755200,,174,3.9714285714285715
191103,4,1573303585,"I recently had a baby, and needed something quick and easy to do while he napped. The steps are fairly easy to learn after a couple times, and I feel that it is a very good workout. Also, you have the option of just doing a 20 minute routine, or doing both parts for a longer workout. I honestly never do the second routine, but it is a bit harder, and I don't like the choreography as much as the first half. Also, there is a cool down stretch routine and diet advice at the end which is really good. Overall I would recommend this workout to those who don't have a lot of time to spare but want a good cardiovascular workout!",1122854400,5,627,4.105691056910569
191104,5,1573303585,"This is a great video if you don't have much time to spare for cardio. Kathy negates the warm up and cooldown (although she does start slowly) in order to cram in more cardio in each 20 minute segment. She has good cue-ing and after a few times through this tape you shouldn't have to look at the screen.

This DVD is done in group format, like all of Kathy's other videos. The thing I noticed when I first popped this tape in (I always view them first before I attempt them) is that there was a lot of whooping and ""Oh Yeah""-ing from the group. It was annoying when I wasn't participating but when I do the video now I hardly notice it. If you are easily distracted though, this might be a problem for you.

The first 20 minute segment is a progressive add on sequence, which means you gradually learn moves and put them together. None of the moves are particularily dancy, and kathy does tell you some adjustments if you don't like some of the moves. Once you learn the entire sequence you repeat it a few times.

The second 20 minute segment has 4 different segments of exercises and gives you two options: high impact or low impact. You start by learning the moves in the low impact group then after a few minutes you switch to a higher intensity calorie burst. You have the option of following the low impact people on one side of the screen or modifying some of the moves and following the high impact people on the other side of the screen.

There is a short 7 minute stretch afterwards.

Like I said before, this is a great video for people who only have a few minutes to spare for cardio. You can do either routine or if you have more time you can do both for 40 minutes of aerobic fun!

I think this video is really fun and it doesn't require any gear like a step or weights (although you'll probably need a water bottle and sweat rag!)",1118966400,11,1846,4.26
191105,4,1573303585,"This workout is good on a day that you don't have much time to exercise.  It has two workouts each 20 minutes long.  The first workout is fine, but not as challenging for me.  The second workout with the advanced moves is great at getting my heart rate up there.  Overall, I like it.  Most of the time I combine both workouts into one.  I love her stretching segment.  Of all her videos that I have, this has the best stretches.",1118880000,2,428,4.209876543209877
191106,5,1573303585,"I like Kathy Smith, but I have to admit that her workouts are sometimes very cheesy.  This DVD does have some parts that make me cringe, but now I just laugh at it.  It is tricky for beginners.  It's dance aerobics.  I love it because its intense cardio with dance moves...not just the same boring step aerobics.  Any of the moves you can modify to an easier or harder version.  It is best if you have room, but my living room is tiny and I find plenty of space to do the workouts.  By the time I finish both 20 minute segments (also following the option for a cardio burst in the second 20 minutes) I feel exhausted, but very happy and rejuvenated.  This is my favorite cardio DVD.  I wish there were more dance ""like"" aerobics out there.",1118275200,,739,4.258992805755396
191107,2,1573303585,"This video has some value because it gets your heart rate up and has some nice strengthening moves, but people with any rhythm will have a hard time following Kathy Smith, who has none.  She also does not let you know in advance what the next move will be, she simply jumps into it which gets confusing.

Simply doing one 20-minute segment will be probably be insufficient for people who are in reasonably good shape.  Also, you need a lot of space to do the routine because it requires a lot of moving around.",1115683200,2,510,4.404255319148936
191108,5,1573303585,"Whenever I fall off the fitness wagon, I get myself back on track by doing one of the two-20 min. workouts featured on this tape. I love the philosophy that a workout doesn't have to be lengthy in order to be a fat burning powerhouse. The variety that this tape offers is resplendent. You have the option of doing the progressive combination of workout one or the varied routine blocks of workout two as well as indulging in the relaxing 7-minute bonus stretch. Initially, I was a little skeptical about the fact that the video did not follow the usual workout tape template---a short warm-up, aerobic routine and a successive cooldown with a stretch. I find that the individual routines' relatively low intensity and add on choreography permit the body to warm-up gradually before moving into the full-fledge aerobic routines, and you always have the option of fast-forwarding to the stretching section. In this workout you have the autonomy to dictate the kind of workout that you want!  P",1115424000,,991,4.863905325443787
191109,5,1573303585,"I thought this was a great work out. There are two 20 minute workouts and a 7 minute stretch. The first work out is a progressive combination, where you keep adding on moves. The second is split into four blocks, each doing a combo low impact twice before you move on to Calorie Bursts. I always feel I got a good aerobic workout with this tape. I always come back to it.",1113609600,,371,4.166666666666667
191110,4,1573303585,"Kathy Smith's ""TimeSaver Cardio Fat Burner,"" is just that...Two twenty-minute segments that are perfect on several levels: one who is beginning aerobic exercise; one who really does not have the time to complete a long aerobic segment; one who might need a ""light"" day, or one who is advanced and wishes to do both segments one after the other.  One also has the option of working the routines to the ""max,"" or keeping it as Kathy has it patterned.  The first routine is considered ""Low Impact.""  Kathy goes through several ""blocks"" of moves and puts them together until one completes the entire twenty minutes worth of low impact.  Of course, one can ""kick it up a notch"" if one feels up to it, but be warned, she does not do traditional ""warm-up,"" and most of the group of exercisers are wearing microphones, and are extremely annoying.  Several of her fellow exercisers take turns ""joining her"" to execute and demonstrate the patterns, and a few in the group even make obvious mistakes!  While there is nothing wrong with having the ""group"" wired for sound, these people are extremely annoying.  When some of the group ""join"" her in the routines, we can obviously hear the ""Hey Kath, how ya doing's???"", but in general, there are a bunch of ""canned"" voices that appear to be coming from nowhere.  After doing the routine several times, I kept hearing a female voice yelling over and over and over, ""GO NANCY, GO!"" A male voice repeating over and over and over, ""GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!  COME ON Y'ALL!"" As well as a few other comments that appear out of the blue, but there did not appear to be anyone in the crowd to sync with the comments!  AAAAAAHHHHHHH!  Also, Kathy gets a bit ""touchy"" when one of her fellow female exercisers joins her up front near the end of the routine and kind of ""instructs,"" by stating, ""V-STEP!"" and Kathy appears a bit annoyed and states, ""OKAY, WE ALREADY KNOW THE ROUTINE, WE'RE NOW JUST HAVING FUN!""  She does this again when another female exerciser joins her after this other person, makes a similar comment, and Kathy yells out, ""OKAY, WE KNOW THE ROUTINE, WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN WITH IT!""  Okay, Kathy, we get it!  It's your show, and no one's takin' over!

Fortunately, for part two, the ""Mixed Aerobics"" section, no one's wired for sound.  This is another twenty minute routine, again, there is no warm up, so be aware of this and take the time to stretch a bit before working.  She goes through each block, and goes into ""cardio bursts.""  It is the same group, one half of the group sticks with ""low impact,"" while the other half of the group goes into ""higher impact"" moves during the cardio bursts, which is a really good option for one who wants to rev up her/his routine.  Kathy seems a bit ""happier"" and more pleasant with her ""group"" in segment two, so it is probably a good idea for Kathy to stick with leading her exercise routines and not having others wired!  It causes too much conflict when attention is taken away from Kathy and does not make Kathy a happy instructor!  I have the VHS version, and overall, aside from the annoyances in segment one, I find this tape to be an excellent addition to one's aerobic routine and library for all of the reasons I mentioned earlier.  There is a stretch segment at the END of the routine with a few of her fellow exercisers, and overall, it is a good workout.",1113177600,2,3356,4.595637583892618
191111,3,1573303585,"This workout does keep your heart rate up and energizes you.  However, Kathy Smith is very bad at teaching the different steps.  There is no time to learn the step and often at the end of the combination I'm still trying to figure out the steps from the beginning.  This makes it very hard to keep up with the video.  I own many home exercise videos and know the typical aerobics steps (from jazzercise, home videos, etc), yet this video is very hard to follow.  Often times, there isn't a very good lead in to the next step or next combination.  Also, the steps do not follow the rhythm of the music at all, which makes them twice as hard to follow.

I would definitely not recommend this tape to a beginner.  While the intensity is do-able by any level, following the exercises is not.",1110326400,3,787,4.379310344827586
191112,2,1573303585,"I have another Kathy Smith DVD so I am familiar with her steps but this workout was just way too rushed. It was not a smooth, rhythmic workout at all. The combination moves are not introduced well - by the time they were on the 4th move of a combination, I was still trying to get the 1st and 2nd one down. I agree with the other reviews that this DVD is not a good idea if you are working out on a carpeted surface. I would rather slow it down a bit even if it means working out for 10 more minutes so that I could actually participate fully in the routine.",1107216000,,558,3.9469026548672566
191113,1,1573303585,"Aerobics routines like this one are the reason I walked out of a Jazzercise class 15 years ago and never darkened the door of a gym again.  The steps are complicated, the cueing is poor, and the instructor does not give the exerciser enough time to learn existing combinations before moving on to something new.  I have a small library of 16 workout DVDs.  This video hasn't left the shelf since I first tried it.  Recently I have rediscovered the joys of working out and lost 25 pounds, but this tape brought the old, awful memories back to me.  If you want a great work out withoout tripping over your own feet, then try Tamilee Webb or Crunch Cardio Sculpt.",1106006400,9,660,4.466666666666667
191114,5,1573303585,"This workout will really rev up your engines, even if you only do the 20 min starter. I usually complete the full 40 minutes, and I have alot of fun, which is what exercise should be. In the first segment the moves are all low-impact, and are progressively added to make up a fun quick workout. In the second 20 min section the moves are more challenging, and there's an option to do high-impact moves. This is not a beginner video, but it's also not impossible to master. Alot of the moves are repeated so you catch on quickly by the end of the segment. There's little or no warm-up in the beginning, but I think that's part of what makes it a time saving but effective video--the working out starts right away. Kathy Smith is perky without being annoying, and is working out with a ton of people. You won't get bored by this video and it will definitely get you sweating.",1104537600,,873,4.361963190184049
191119,3,1573303585,"I do like Kathy Smith (see my other reviews), so it pains me to give her a review less than 5 stars. Problem is, in keeping with the ""time saving"" theme, this workout is just completley rushed. She has about 15 people (not an exaggeration) exercising with her. It is as if she held an open casting call for exercisers and then did not want to turn ANYONE down. Of the 15, there are not even 2 people doing the same routine. Kathy is off beat 1/2 the time, there is some crazy Yoko Ono looking women who is just all over the place...actually, she's one of the positive things about this workout since she is at least amusing.

 All in all, this is still a decent cardio workout. You will work up a sweat and it's only a 20 time commitment. Considering there aren't a ton of good cardio dvds out there, it's not a bad one to have in your collection. I just wouldn't reccommend this to people who are new to cardio workouts.",1091318400,14,921,4.2272727272727275
191120,5,1573303585,"I only have a few pure floor hi-lo workouts because I am choreography-challenged. I am really glad Kathy came up with this one. There are two 20 minute segments. First segment is a low-impact dance cardio and the second segment is more hi-impact with some tricky steps. I don't think this is a pure beginner video because of the tricky steps. But if I was able to get it down in a few tries, I'm sure anyone will. I will rate this entire workout as intermediate. However, I will rate second segment as intermediate/advanced because of the higher impact and the tricky moves. Kathy is more energetic in this video so if you prefer a more somber and subdued Kathy then this workout is not for you. I prefer energetic instructors especially when doing cardio so this doesn't bug me. I hope Kathy makes another hi-lo workout soon! TWO THUMBS UP!",1090627200,8,841,4.576158940397351

This tape is great.  The workout is a challenge--not too easy for experienced exercisers, but not too hard for beginners.
The only drawback is that Kathy and her ""helpers"" are a little too perky and cheery, hence the 4-star review instead of 5.  I always liked Kathy Smith because she never peppered her workouts with too many phony ""you can do it!"" and ""who-hoos!""  She was in a good mood but not overly cheerful like other aerobic instructors.  But I can ignore this part of it in order to get a great workout.
Yes, there is no formal ""warm-up,"" but the first few minutes of the workout are pretty slow and easy, so that's like a warm-up for me.  To be honest, I have always skipped past the warm-up section of any workout and proceeded directly to the main program, and I have not injured myself, ever.  So this was not a problem for me.",1089936000,8,1019,4.303664921465969
191122,2,1573303585,"...nor even folks (like me) who have done aerobics before, but not for a number of years.
I already work out on cardio machines at the gym 4 days a week and wanted to add some aerobics routines to my home workouts. This seemed like a good program to try with the two different 20 minutes sets to do independantly or together, but I must say I found it more frustrating than  calorie-burning. Perhaps if I give it a few more tries to learn the moves, I don't know.
My biggest caution is that there is NO warmup so you definitely want to stretch on your own before starting the first workout. This seemed like a bad idea to me. While some of the moves were simple, others I found very difficult to put together and wish she had spent more time demonstrating at a slower pace before piling on all kinds of variations in the routines (perhaps a ""bonus"" chapter on the DVD to simply illustrate the different moves at a slow speed would have helped?) I ended up spending a lot of time just marching in place to keep my pace up when I'd get completely lost.
Also? The fancy camera tricks and stuff was really annoying, especially when you're just trying to figure out what is going on.
I will say that the 7-minute cooldown routine is quite good if very standard--seemed exactly like the cooldown I was used to when I'd go to a gym for aerobics years before.
All in all, if you're fairly familiar and practiced in aerobics moves and want an at-home workout, this probably isn't too bad. If you're out of practice or a complete newbie to it, I'd say look for something a little slower and more basic first.",1081641600,3,1598,4.3624161073825505
191123,4,1573303585,"I'm not sure why so many people think the routines on this tape are too hard. They're not! And I'm not the most coordinated person on earth. Just do them a few times, and you'll quickly get the hang of it. The moves are well-choreographed and fun and you'll really get a good workout. The only complaint I have with Kathy is that she has a habit of saying ""last time!"" and then proceeding to do the routine again. It confuses her crew, since you can see a couple of them actually stop as Kathy keeps going. Other than that, this tape is great!",1076284800,3,543,4.230769230769231
191124,5,1573303585,"I think this is a truly great video for exercise enthusiasts at any level! As a busy mom and full time student, I really have to get creative to get my exercise in and this video makes working out easy! Some days when my time is really tight, I just opt to do the first 20 min segment which is a progressive add on routine that I just LOVE! Kathy includes some exciting moves in this routine that really keep me going and she doesn't overdue it with repetitive and boring steps like some videos. Instead of doing a huge chunk of hamstring curls followed by a huge segment of side leg lifts followed by a bunch of jumping jacks etc....she really mixes things up with a creative and fun rountine that you will learn a little bit at a time until you have the whole thing down. Then you will repeat this completed routine 3 times through which really helps me to work up a good sweat! I love the fact that I can do this 20 min routine and walk away feeling like I've really worked out and burned some major calories! Also, she has on wonderful people with her that switch coming up to ""help her out"" for different segments. I love how positive and upbeat Kathy is and there is some really nice interaction between her and the people working out with her.
If you have more time and are feeling up to it, this video offers a fantastic second 20 min segment that includes 4 waves of mini-routines. What's so great about this workout is that within each wave, it is structured so you first learn all the moves of your mini-routine and then you go into the ""cardio burst"" where you really work it! Kathy gives you the option of keeping things simple the way you've first learned the steps, or kicking it up a notch to a higher impact level during the cardio burst. Half of the people working out with her demonstrate the simple way, and the other half the harder. Awesome!
An added bonus is a very  relaxing and thorough 7 min stretch. I definitely think this is one of the best stretch routines on any of Kathy's aerobics videos. Sometimes I will just go to this track and do the stretch after other workout videos who's cooldowns just aren't as good.
I have been doing this video for 2 years now about 1-2x per week alternating with several other of Kathy's videos and I NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS ONE! This is an absolute must have for your collection- especially for those days when you're short on time.

Being a mother of 3 small children, it is very convenient for me to have the workout broken down in to two 20-minute sections.  I also like the fact that she offers high- and low-impact options in the second workout.  However... I don't think this is one of Kathy's BEST workouts.  I found the steps in the first workout to be a bit on the dancey side for my taste, although I was able to get them down without a problem after a couple viewings, but some of the transitions from one move to another still seem a bit clumsy or abrupt.  I also found the production quality of this tape to be a little below par of what I would normally expect from Kathy Smith.  That said, this is still a good workout that will be useful to beginners as well as more intermediate level exercisers.",1070582400,6,935,4.184357541899441
191127,5,1573303585,"I bought this DVD several months ago and still find myself coming back to it regularly.  Regardless of some of the negative reviews it has here, it is one of my favorites.  It is very fast-paced and definitely keeps you on the toes.  But I'm not going to lie, it took me several attempts to get the steps down correctly.  The first few times, I was absolutely lost due to the many moves and pace of the routines.
It is pretty dancey but it still involves some fundamental aerobic exercises like kick backs, jumping jacks, kicks, lunges and leg lifts.  The first 20 mins of the DVD, she teaches you several different moves and you will be building a large routine.  Once you have learned the steps, you will go through the routine several times.  The second part of the DVD involves four mini routines in which she will teach you the steps.  Once you go through them a few times, you will go through it a few more times but with one side of the group doing the ""calorie bursts"".  I am still trying to incorporate some of the calorie burst moves, but they are tougher and is taking some time.
Overall, I would rate this DVD an A+ since it still keeps my attention and I still work up a sweat.  The shouting, that has been mentioned in the background, is not as bad as I thought it would be from the reviews.  I normally stay focused on Kathy anyhow, so I don't hear the background noise.",1064707200,35,1385,4.308880308880309

BY THE END OF THE FIRST HALF, I WAS SWEATING AS MUCH AS I USUALLY DO WHEN I DO AEROBICS,AND FELT LIKE I WAS READY FOR THE SECOND HALF. THE SECOND HALF IS HARDER BUT IF YOU DID THE FIRST PART, THEN YOUR READYTO DO IT. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED AND FOUND TO CATCH ON TO THE MOVES VERY QUICKLY. IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH DANCY AEROBICS ROUTINES,(WHICH I LOVE,) THEN THIS IS THE TAPE FOR YOU! I FOUND THE ROUTINES TO BE VERY REPETATIVE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU GOT IT DOWN AFTER THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU LIKE BORING WORKOUTS, WITHOUT DANCY ROUTINES, THEN THIS ISN'T FOR YOU. THIS ONE IS LOUD, BUT THE YELLING IS FUN, MOTIVATING, AND THE WORKOUT IS QUITE MORE CHALLENGING THAN I EXPECTED.

I MAY SOUND LIKE A CHEESE BALL TO SOME OF YOU WHO HATE THE YELLING, BUT WHO WANTS A QUIET BORING WORKOUT, COME ON PEOPLE ITS AEROBICS AND ITS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN, UNLIKE OTHER WORKOUT VIDEOS.

I am relatively fit and used to exercising but these DVDs do nothing for me - in fact if you could rate them in the negatives I would! The choreography is messy, there are so many people jumping around it is hard to see what you are meant to be doing at any given time. The camera jumps from shot to shot so quickly that a lot of guess work has to be done in order to keep moving!

The set is bright, the atmosphere is fun (you'll tune out much of the extraneous yelling anyway, but the other reviewers are right about Kathy's party mood); the choreography is challenging, but once I learned the steps, it was easier. To ensure a good workout, I make the moves bigger and bounce or hop the steps more. Kathy's cueing is excellent and the changes in the people she brings up front to ""help out"" adds interest to me.

The moves are NOT extremely complex and she uses lots of build up moves and repetition.

191155,4,1573303585,"This video is a great sweat-breaker for people who have been doing aerobics already for a while. Probably not for a beginner at all, since Smith goes through a number of the steps/combos so fast that if you didn't already know what, say, a grapevine was, you'd probably be confused. I think at the very beginning, I was thrown because the steps did not always correspond with the downbeat to the music (having been a band geek long ago, I can't stand it when they step offbeat.) But it seemed after the workout started that I didn't notice that happen too often. There is the one spot where the ""guy"" messes up-- I do always miss it, and agree with Kathy that ""he's fired.""  But just catch up after a sec, and you'll be fine.
There are, in the second 20 minute workout, two ""tracks""-- one low impact & one high. I am not a fan of the high impact, since my knees & feet aren't fabulous after many years as a waitress in my youth. But the low impact in the second half was fine, and unlike some low-impact workouts, I didn't feel that low impact meant low workout. There *is* a lot of choreography in this workout-- which is why I bought it because I am BORED with the stuff that is not as complex. So I like it okay-- but warn you that if you aren't a quick study, this one will probably frustrate you. If you like the action of a step-type workout but can't take the up and down anymore (the knees again) then this one will be good.
I was so-so about the cool down stretch at the end. My hamstring is really tight-- always has been and nothing seems to stretch it out. So since I am not really comfortable with the long leg stretches, I was not as cooled down as I like to be. But if you don't have flexibility issues then you'll be fine with it. I do so love those twisty-spine stretches on the floor-- they really are relaxing.
In all, Smith is not an annoying chatty instructor. Her gang of dancers doesn't make too many irritating-after-the-tenth-time wisecracks. However, I do think that the sound techs recorded some of the ones they do make and repeat them at odd times.  After a while, you start to get to know voices & recoginze hearing one when their lips aren't moving.  This, however, can be both funny & annoying.  Just tune it out and go for the sweat.
She has a lot of energy, even if she sometimes doesn't explain the steps for the beginner,and low impact does NOT mean NO impact.
This is worth putting into your mix of tapes/DVD for the home aerobics workout. I hate going to classes, but do get tired of the same old video all the time. This is a good one and not super-sweet faux motivation.",1027900800,4,2610,4.298780487804878

The steps can seem confusing, but I thought once I did it once it was fine. However, the steps for the high impact version are vague and not so easy to understand. The people are not quite all in the camera shot and therefore difficult to follow sometimes.
If you need a fast workout in your hotel room, this is the ticket. I wouldn't use it for an on-going program. Limited stretching to none at all at the beginning, but at the end the 7 minute stretch is great.

The only thing I would change about this video is that the routines were at least 10 minutes longer and I could do without the backup people helping out Kathy, but they're really not that bad. I workout to this video before I go to work and I really enjoy it. I will say that this probably isn't a video for beginners. This is something you want to work up to, but if you're like me and have been working out for a while, you'll really enjoy it and the moves won't seem so hard. If you're a beginner, this is something to work towards and once you get through the video without having to stop, I promise you'll feel great! Kathy Smith really isn't a high impact instructor, at least not compared to what I'm used to, but she's a great instructor and I have many of her videos. Although, there are complaints in some reviews of her ""cueing"" on this video I think it's fine and not hard to catch on to. If you're looking for a good workout, which doesn't allow you to be lazy and actually forces you to work, this is for you!",1014076800,24,1997,4.123076923076923
191165,5,1573303585,"This is one of my favorite Kathy Smith DVDs. There are two 20 minute workout segments. The first is a low-impact section that features easy-to-learn choreography. The second is a hi-lo workout with an intense ""calorie burst"" option(i.e. skips, hops, jumping jacks and jogs). I usually do the whole 40 minutes and I get a really good intermediate workout. It's fun and I don't find it boring at all. This is definitely a good buy!",1012953600,,429,4.733333333333333
191166,5,1573303585,"I have almost all of Kathy Smith's workout tapes, but this is my favorite. Both routines are a lot of fun and I have never gotten bored with them. I think I used this tape 3-4 times per week every week for the first three months I had it and I still love it! Returning to working out after having a baby was tough, but this was one of the first tapes I got out again.  My 4 month-old laughs out loud while watching this tape.  What great motivation for me to be exercising and entertaining my baby!  As always, Kathy is enthusiatic without being too ""cheerleader perky"" and she is a wonderful instructor.  I love you, Kathy!",1005264000,6,624,4.262711864406779
191167,1,1573303585,"Kathy and co started to bore me very shortly. While the moves are fine, I quickly tired of Kathy and the 'whoop whoop' crew. It's such a white bread video that it did not hold my interest. Exercise video must wear well and this one does not. I prefer Gin Miller who is more hip and easy to live with for a long time.",999648000,5,316,3.953125
191168,4,1573303585,"I enjoy all of Kathy Smith's videos and this one was no different.  Doing this video is a good way to  spend 40 minutes working out, but I find that I like the 2nd half better. It's kind of like interval training. You're constantly moving, but for a couple of minutes you do calorie bursts where you up the movement a little bit. Everyone doesn't up it, so you can follow the people moving slower on your slow days and follow the people moving faster on your fast days.  One big complaint from me is the people in the video are a little to happy and they all have microphones, so every little cheesy statement they say is picked up. The chick on the right in the very beginning is the most annoying. They also do a lot of moving around. Not in the routines, but different people move up to the front to kind of ""take over"" the class. Great attitudes, but sometimes it seems a little fake. Overall though, this is another good Smith video and you won't be disappointed.",996192000,12,968,4.3076923076923075
191169,5,1573303585,"Once I did this video a couple times through I got all the ""moves"" down.  I never tire of it and if I do the 40 minutes straight through I really feel as though I got to my target heart rate (and then some).  I ALWAYS go back to this video because it is SO much fun to do.  I LOVE IT!!",995587200,3,285,3.564516129032258

Try this: w/o in your underwear in front of a full length mirror! Sure has pushed me! I can complete this w/o 6 days a week-and knowing its only 20 minutes...piece of cake! I actually like the ""mess ups"" made by some of the folks on tape-seems like real people!",994464000,,398,4.050632911392405
191171,2,1573303585,"I think my main mistake was to try out this video for the very first time at 6 a.m.  I should have waited until I was more alert.  By yawning for a second too long I think I missed half the routine.  I mastered about half the moves by the 3rd or 4th time using this tape, so one can expect the steps to be quite challenging for newbies.  Kathy runs through each move *very* quickly (mercy if you must pause for a sip of water), so pay very close attention.  I honestly think I'd have better things to say about this program if I could just get past all the annoying whoops and you-GO-girl yelps from her MC Hammer-like entourage.  They need to go away (or shut up).  Bottom line: If you have a knack for picking up fast-paced moves, this tape will give you a pretty decent workout -- it's hi-enegery and will make you sweat.  Otherwise, stick with something more intermediate.",994377600,,876,4.298780487804878
191172,4,1573303585,"There is a swap table in my apartment complex and a few weeks ago I found this video there.  I consider myself in good shape; I workout with weights at the gym twice a week, I do long distance bike rides, I own a treadmill, my flexibility level is excellent, I regularly go on lengthy brisk walks, etc.  I used to run but damaged my knees because of it.  I have to be careful with exercise because of my knees and the only real pain I have now is when I'm walking up stairs.  The last aerobic tape I ever tried was Jane Fonda back in the 1980's and although the workouts were a bit tough I was able to keep up.  I figured this Kathy Smith video would be a piece of cake, but it wasn't.
I work long hours at my job and the time saver aspect of this video appealed to me the most.  During the workweek, if I don't exercise in the morning I won't exercise at all.  I've been doing this video for about 3 weeks now, three times a week.  I get up at 5:00 am to fit in the exercise, and believe me, I am not a morning person.  This video does wake you up fast and gets your heart rate up.
I think the tempo of this video is too fast to be considered beginner level, but if you stick with it and don't allow yourself to be discouraged you will pick up the steps in time.  I usually only do the first 20 minute video and the 10 minute stretch at the end of the tape.  I hardly have any room to work out and it's also not easy to do the quick steps on wall to wall carpeting.  I modify the workout so that I'm not jumping up and down on my knees and twisting my knees, as some of the moves seem to do.  Even with my modifications I get a good workout and get my heart rate up.  When I first started doing the tape I had to stop the tape frequently to drink water.  The workout gets you feeling warm fast so have the fan going at the start.
After the first workout and stretch I feel incredibly energized and it is a great way to wake up and start the morning.  This video is a bit confusing and fast paced for those like me who don't attend aerobics classes or do many aerobics videos, but you will catch on if you keep trying.  I find the hard bodies who are doing the class with Kathy a bit fake with their enthusiasm, but their fit bodies are inspiring. Everyone seems like they are on speed, but maybe it's just that I'm half-asleep when I'm starting out!  I am definitely wide-awake when the workout is over.",978998400,109,2404,3.993723849372385
191173,4,1573303585,"This workout is really great for those days that you can not get up in the morning.  You can still catch those 20 minutes of workout.  Kathy is both enegetic and keeps you going.  I don't recommend this video for everyday  because I don't feel that I get enough of a calorie burn, but 20 minutes of  workout is better than no workout at all!",959904000,3,341,4.184615384615385
191174,5,1573303585,"I have had this video for 6 months.  It is a nice video to put in to change the pace.  I also work out on the treadmill.  To add change, I will do Kathy's 1st 20 mintue workout one day and treadmill another.  Then the  next day do the second 20 minute workout.  On weekends when I have more  time, I will do the whole 40 minute workout.  I enjoy her yelling...it can  be annoying, but it does get me moving and the time passes quickly. I agree  that the first few times, the moves were difficult, but with time they get  much more easier.  Great job, Kathy.  When is your next one coming out?",949104000,23,592,4.043478260869565
191175,4,1573303585,"Unlike other reviewers I wasn't a bit annoyed withthe talking in the video. I have other tapes which are MUCH more annoying. Anyway, the first time you try it out it might take a little work, but after a few gos, it  will be fun and easy. The second workout is simpler than the first, mainly  because it breaks down ito four seperate routines. I liked how the second  workout allows you take it up a notch if you so desire. It's low impact and  easy on the knees. Overall fun and quick if you have the initative to spare  twenty minutes.",946857600,11,537,4.2254901960784315
191176,3,1573303585,I am a big Kathy Smith fan but I was disappointed by this video.  The dance steps are hard for someone like me who doesn't have any dance experience.  Try her Kickboxing workout for high intensity.,946684800,12,197,4.444444444444445
7798009,5,1573303585,"I LOVE this workout- two 20-minute high-energy segments. Constant high heart-rate activity. Can do one or both depending on your mood. (I personally do her first 20-minute toning segment from her Instant Workout, then switch over to this DVD and do the first 20 minute of this workout). I took dancing for 10 years when young, so the steps are easy. For non-dancing backgrounds, might be a bit more challenging to get all of the moves, and therefore not as fun to everyone as it is to me. I used to do this in my 20s.... now I'm past 40 and I've dug it out again, using it in conjunction with what I cited above, plus her Kickboxing workout (which is awesome) and Tracy Mallard's The Method - Cardio Bootcamp (doing my own little get-fit weight loss plan) for a total cross-training effect.",1464739200,,790,4.531468531468532
