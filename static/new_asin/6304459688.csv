879524,2,6304459688,"This 1952 serial adventure stars Kirk Alyn (famous as Superman of the serials) as the head of a flying squadron. The bad news is that there is surprisingly little airborne footage in this, and nothing much happens for  several chapters. The good news is that the serial wakes up later on, with  plenty of action and well-staged stunt work by David Sharpe. And for those  who enjoy the peculiar lapses of logic found only in Columbia serials,  there are a few uninentional laughs (two pilots bail out of an airplane and  shut the door BEHIND them). This video will appeal most to fans of Kirk  Alyn and to kids.",944611200,9,610,4.5504587155963305
879635,5,6304459688,"Great Columbia 1952 serial given a new life by Mill Creek Entertainment. Columbia's chapter endings were probably the best as you see the wipe go 360 degrees changing the picture and you hear Knox Manning's commanding voice asking questions about the next episode, and the music building to a crescendo as he says, ""don't miss ""The Iron Monster"", chapter four of ""Blackhawk"" at this theater next week"". Chilling, thrilling, and great Saturday matinee memories are all here for you to enjoy thanks to Sony/Mill Creek Entertainment. Would be nice to see other Columbia serials released with great picture and sound. Highly recommended for all front row kid serial buffs of the 40's and 50's. 5 STARS....",1491091200,8,701,5.051724137931035

Still, Kirk Alyn makes a credible Blackhawk (more convincing than his go-round as Superman) while the 1952 chapterplay rises above the low-budget depths of Katzman's infamous ""Batman and Robin"" (1949).

879718,4,6304459688,"Almost everyone has an opinion and certain ""feelings"" about how movies are translated from books (certainly including comic books)and brought to the big screen.  I can appreciate those who feel disdain at a movie or serial that does not follow the comic book that they were fond of in days past.

I always compare movies with the original source material if there is any - but, I try to see each work for it's own merits if any exist.  Of course I realize that it still will be our personal opinion as to the merits or lack of for any movie.  Each opinion has merit and is due respect to the reviewer - even if we respectfully disagree.

I never read the comic book of Blackhawk so I don't have any opinion as to the loyalty of the serial.  I believe many of the other reviewers as to the many differences.  I enjoyed this serial from several standpoints however.

There is no doubt in my mind the Republic produced the very best of the serials.  Their formula was repeated time and time again - with most offerings being very entertaining.  This Colombia serial had some of the feel and atmosphere of a Republic serial although I will admit the writing and directing were not as good (thus my 4 star rating).  The characters were likeable and the action very similar to many of the movies and tv shows of the 50's. Remember how Rocky Jones or Flash Gordon could jump into a rocket ship, turn a few dials and wind up on another planet in a few minutes?  We still loved the action and ""intricacies"" of the visuals...  and the characters.

This serial is well worth adding to your collection.  The transfer to VHS is very good and comparable to the Republic transfers - which are incredible.",1254268800,3,1689,4.456026058631922

BIOS:

1  Kirk Alyn (aka: John Feggo Jr.)

Date of birth: 8 October 1910 - Oxford, New Jersey

Date of death: 14 March 1999 - The Woodlands, Texas,

Special footnote, Kirk Alyn was an American actor, best known for being the first actor

to play Superman on screen, in the 1948 film serial ""Superman"", and its 1950 sequel

""Atom Man Vs. Superman"", starring in some similar comic book-type serials

""Daughter of Don Q"" (1946), ""Federal Agents Vs. Underworld Inc"" (1948),

""Blackhawk"" (1952) Alyn shared a very short cameo with his serial co-star, Noel Neill,

as the parents of the young Lois Lane in the 1978 feature film, ""Superman: The Movie"".

Kirk Alyn had been Grand Marshal of the Metropolis, Illinois Christmas parade and

Annual Superman Celebrations several times.

2. Carol Forman (aka: Carolyn Sawls)

Date of birth: 19 June 1918 - Epps, Alabama

Date of death: 9 July 1997 - Burbank, California

Special footnote, Raven-haired Carol Forman's main claim to fame is the fact that she was one

of the first villainesses in serials, Forman was not afraid to use her considerable attractiveness to

bamboozle the poor saps who tried to stop her nefarious plans for world domination, to steal

atomic secrets, or whatever she had up her sleeve, It was in 1947 that she essayed the role that

she is probably most famous for: ""The Spider Woman"" in Republic's ""The Black Widow"" (1947).

Forman made a big splash in that part and Republic immediately assigned her to other ""bad girl"" parts,

but she turned them down, not wanting to be pigeonholed in serials, she freelanced for a while,

doing a few westerns and a Columbia serial, then returned to Republic for her turn as the villain

Nila in 1949's ""Federal Agents vs. Underworld, Inc"". (1949).

3. Spencer Gordon Bennet (The Serial King) (Director)

Date of birth: 5 January 1893 - Brooklyn, New York, New York

Date of death: 8 October 1987 - Santa Monica, California

Special footnote, Spencer Gordon Bennet, was known as the ""King of Serial Directors"" he directed more film serials than anybody else, Bennet first entered show business as a stunt man, when he answered a newspaper ad to jump from the Palisades of the Hudson River while wearing a suit for the serial film Hurricane Hutch. The gig at that time paid $1 per foot he had to fall ... Bennet made his directorial debut in ""Behold The Man"" (1921), but made his serial directorial debut in with ""Sunken Silver"" (1925), Bennet would keep making serials, as well as B westerns features, until the very end of the genre, directing the very last two made in the United States, ""Blazing the Overland Trail"" (1956) and ""Perils of the Wilderness"" (1956). After the serials ended he directed a handful of features, his final directorial credit with ""The Bounty Killer"" (1965) with Dan Duryea, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe, Johnny Mack Brown, Fuzzy Knight, I. Stanford Jolley Richard Arlen and Rod Cameron, which was also the final film to feature noted cowboy star Gilbert ""Broncho Billy"" Anderson ... when Bennet died in 1987, his tombstone was engraved ""The Final Chapter"" ... over his long career Bennet directed over a hundred serials including ""Atom Man vs Superman"" (1950) serial, ""The Adventures of Sir Galahad"" (1949), ""Batman and Robin"" (1949), ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944), ""Captain Video"" (1951), and numerous western serials. Among his western B-features were his long running ""Red Ryder"" series, featuring Don ""Red"" Barry, Wild Bill Elliott and Allan Rocky Lane during the '40s.

4.  Fred F. Sears  (Director/Actor)

Date of birth:  7 July 1913 - Boston, Massachusetts

879720,5,6304459688,"I grew up on Blackhawk comic books and I've wanted to see this serial for years. I went into it with low expectations after reading the negative comments on here, but what a pleasant surprise! This is great fun! I think Kirk is great and there's plenty of fun to be had. The depiction of Chop Chop in this version is far better that the racist depiction in the 1940's comics. This is good stuff. Perhaps not the best serial, but it is FUN!",1151452800,7,439,4.238095238095238
879721,1,6304459688,"I wish the title were original, and it was, but Simone Signoret beat me into print with it.

I caught one episode of this when I was in my early teens and always wanted to see what I'd missed.  Be careful what you wish for.

In the comics, the characters had comic-opera accents, but in this bomb, Olaf doesn't even have a Minnesota accent, much less Swedish, and none of the other ""international"" characters have one either.  I know this was shot on a budget of a buck twenty-nine, but they cast a shrimp as Andre, then couldn't apparently spring for an eyebrow pencil to give him his trademark moustache.  None of the blonds from the comic seemed to be blond, so they apparently couldn't spring for a couple of bottles of hydrogen peroxide, either.

The director of photography seemed to have cut his classes on lighting, the fights were apparently choreographed on the spot (I figure the Blackhawks won about 60% of the brawls, which hardly qualifies them for superhero stardom.)  The effects were generally so cheesy they were funny.

The biggest problem was the writing.  There were three writers and I got the feeling they only got together once to divvy up the job.  The first writer probably said, ""I can create something really inane with a six-pack and half a brain.""

The second writer apparently said, ""I can lose your plot (Where did the death-ray plot go?  I dunno, it was here just a minute ago.  Well, we'll skip on to an even more inane plot about Element X) and do something even more inane with six shots of tequila and half a prefrontal lobe.""

Apparently the third writer said, ""I can create a real mess with a quart of rotgut and the march of the dead brain cells.""

I'm not going to recommend whether or not to buy this dog, but I will warn you that if you're getting it for nostalgia, keep your memories.  If you want to see how bollixed-up the old serials were and like to laugh at the incompetent, this could be a great acquisition.",1115510400,9,1958,4.504249291784703

Mill Creek's release of The Shadow is gorgeous. But on Blackhawk the bitrate it too low. The film credits are not sharp & show combing artifacts. Close-ups are fine, but once the picture moves to a medium or long shot the picture loses sharpness and takes on a sandy, grainy texture. And NO I don't mean film grain. This has to do with a too low bit rate. Especially in long shots the picture looks like it has a gritty layer of sand over it. In one medium close shot Blackhawk is speaking to a couple of people and Kirk Alyn's mouth disappears in a mush of pixels. I couldn't finish chapter 1. This release will probably be fine for a lot of people, but for me it was a waste of money. I'll stick to my fan-copy. It's way sharper & more enjoyable.",1498867200,4,885,4.181286549707602

7871564,4,6304459688,"Excellent series in two VHS.  Kirk Allyn really looks like Blackhawk of the comics but he's the only one because  all the other characters are so-so and Andre, who is supposed to be a great lover, didn't even shine although they did make Stan shine,  and I didn't even see Olaf with his ""Yumpin' Yiminy!"" Chop Chop was not the comic book Chop Chop but a regular Chinese cook who didn't do any fighting at all,  and Hendrickson was a mechanic and was too old and fat to do any fighting.  If Chuck was there he didn't stand out at all.  Villainess was rather charismatic and they should have had Blackhawk and her have a romance, but most of it was car chases and brawling all over creation.",1494633600,,689,4.34375
7871565,4,6304459688,"Blackhawk was an above average Columbia Studio's serial movie. The pacing was quick and the thinly weaved plot held you attention well enough.
The fact that the good guys never carry any guns made no sense at all, since their adversaries were always armed. To this end you will see that the villains aren't very good shots.
There's plenty of classic stunt work (done real time during filming in those days), lots of airplanes (even if the type of aircraft isn't kept the same from scene to scene), lots of fist fights and lots of fun for you.
DVD quality is very good, Mill Creek is to be commended on this near pristine print.",1493424000,5,627,4.508771929824562
7871566,4,6304459688,"Blackhawk was a comic that was popular in the 50's and 60's. This is a serial based on that  comic. Kirk Alyn an actor who starred as the first Superman in two serials,  does a good job here in bringing the character of Blackhawk to the screen. Carol Forman who was the villain in the first Superman serial is one again here. She is excellent and adds a lot of class to this production. The only problem is that  the serial is squarely in the end days of the serial films and shows. Lack of budget and a story that telegraphs it's punches makes it a little tough to watch. Overall it should appeal to fans of the genre. I am glad to have it in my collection.",1493337600,2,658,4.125
