2193899,1,B0006SSNXM,"Yet another attempt by the WWE to tell us what we want by throwing all of these non-wrestling, non-experienced, non-skilled women in our face and calling them divas. Ivory, Victoria, Lita, and Trish are the only true wrestling divas here; all the new contest winning (and losing) women are no different from the ho's the Godfather used to bring to the ring with him.

Boring, slow paced, unimaginative content that just mimics the DVD from last year. Some ok scenes here and there, but very low quality content overall. Don't expect to see any good matches on the 'extras' menu; remember, they fired the good wrestling divas in order to hire the non-wrestling ho's.",1114905600,12,665,4.833333333333333
2193900,5,B0006SSNXM,"Overall the Divas 2005 DVD was another great product.  The only major exception is Jonathan Coachman.  How does this guy still have a job with WWE.  He was annoying, aggravating, and a major pissant just even as narrator.  One point of the DVD finds himself playing photographer trying to find ""the next hot diva"" which at this he photographs a 9-year old little girl coming out the pool and he seems to be enjoying it.  I'm glad Trish temporarily shut him up for a while.  And speaking of Trish, once again she has to single-handly save the Divas franchise despite not making the cover of the DVD or magazine spread.  Trish's body always looks the best and that will never change.  I got the combo from Shopzone.com for 18 bucks.  Besides Trish, the usual divas like Stacy and Torrie delivered too, but some of the new girls really surprised me.  Lilian Garcia.......WOW what a goddess, she needs to do more shoots in the future and keep that healthy body in check.  Even with Coach's annoyance, Viva Las Divas proves that hot bodies and hot, sandy beaches always make a great combination.  I even comprised a list of the best bodies on the DVD/Magazine.

Side Note: This DVD is also the last time we see Amy Weber before her departure so if you're a Amy fan then this DVD will help you relieve your stress of missing Amy.

5. Maria Kanellis

4. Amy Weber

3. Lita

2. Tie between Christy Hemme and Torrie Wilson

1. Trish Stratus(of course)",1114819200,6,1442,4.544747081712062
2193901,1,B0006SSNXM,"I agree with an earlier poster, if I want to see hot women on DVD, I'd get some porn.  Throw in the fact that the greatest Diva of all, Molly Holly, isn't on here (we'll miss you Molly), and you should save your money..............to spend on a Kurt Angle DVD.  The public demands it, oh it's true, we want a DVD dedicated to the most celebrated real athlete in WWF history, our Olympic hero.  It should be three disks:

One of Angle with hair (with matches against Jericho, Austin, Benoit, Rock and the Armageddon 6 man Hell in a Cell and more)

One of Angle bald (with matches against Benoit, Hogan, Guerrero, tag team matches with Benoit and more)

One dedicated to great Angle promos - (the early years, with Stephanie McMahon, Team ECK- (Edge Christian and Kurt), the Invasion era with Austin, Team Angle and more)

I bet a dollar and a donut it will far outsell this DVD.  If I wanted to see talentless bimbos, I'd go down to the Crazy Horse.  Otherwise, Anglemania must continue to run wild.",1114300800,3,998,4.469613259668508
2193902,3,B0006SSNXM,"I give this Diva's DVD 3 stars this year. If your into the bikini's (most males are) then you will like this very much. Most of the Diva Search Girls clips are very short (Amy, Maria, Michelle, Candice, Joy, and Melina) while the other Diva clips are very long. This DVD also is missing one of the current roster Diva's Molly. If you're a very big Molly fan and only wanting to buy this for her you shouldn't cause she isn't on this. Also, they extras this year are mostly t&a wrestling, so most males should love that. Overall I give this a 3. I thought the main video was alright. I thought the extras were alright to. This DVD isn't better then last years though.",1113004800,2,666,4.2936507936507935
2193903,2,B0006SSNXM,"2004 was a horrible year. Victoria lost her cool insane image and became a lame bum jiggler. Sable and Stephanie were gone. The Lita pregnant by Kane premise was horrible and a overall lack of Diva wrestling matches.

well, I purchased this DVD anyway (so I could complete my DIVA DVD collection). If you think this DVD is good or bad depends on your reasons for buying the DVD. If your purchasing this DVD for the bikini photo shoot, then you will like this DVD (because it features many Divas including Lilian Garcia and Christy Hemme). If your purchasing this DVD for the womens wrestling matches and extras, you will be dissapointed.

EXTRAS INCLUDE:
lita and kanes wedding
dance contest between Molly and Stacy (also cut too soon)
School girl match: Dawn and Torrie VS Moolah and Mae Young
Pilgrim indian match: Miss Jackie VS Dawn Marie
WWE womens title match: Lita VS Trish
2 ligerie pillow fights with Christy Hemme
Halloween costume contest: Torrie Wilson VS Dawn Marrie
2 commercials for the Smackdown VS Raw video game
Lilian Garcia sings the National Anthem
Raw magazine cover shoot: trish and Christian, then Victoria
Stacy talking about her obsession with her mirror
and more!!!

Well, what can I say. The worst DIVA year yet and the worst Diva DVD yet. I really don't care about the photo shoots. It's not very interesting or fun hearing all the girls say the same thing (how sexy they feel, how beautiful the beach is, and how hard it is sitting bull legged). I buy the DIVA DVDs for the Extras and this years extras are horrible. The DIVA DVD ""tropical pleasure"" had great matches from payper view events. This DVD only has 3 womens matches from Smackdown and Raw and they are edited horribly. The clips are cut off before the action is over. For example: the school girl match featuring Dawn Marie and Torrie VS Mae Young and Moolah (the clip ends before we see Dawn Marie give a sneak attack after the match). There is other clips that end too soon also (such as the dance contest between Molly and Stacy).

While some guys may not be dissapointed because they want to spank their monkey to boring softcore, Im pissed that the great female wrestling of the past years is dissapearing...

if you must have this DVD for your collection, don't over pay. I got my copy at deepdiscountdvd.com for under 14 dollars",1112918400,22,2327,4.652068126520681
2193904,5,B0006SSNXM,"hey can someone please post what extras this dvd has on it? for example, what extra diva matches there are on the dvd and any other special features?",1112832000,,149,4.357142857142857
2193905,4,B0006SSNXM,"Like every other Diva's DVD, I enjoy seeing the photo shoots come to life, getting to see what goes in to a shoot & the stuff that is rarely seen, except on these DVD's, like the Divas actually coexisting. I was extremely pleased to finally see the often-forgotten Diva - Lilian Garcia, getting her chance to shine. Getting to replay Trish in her lingerie gown as Lita's 'bridesmaid' puts this DVD up to 5 stars alone. However, you then would have to endure (if you actually choose it) Mae Young & Moolah in the 'School Girl Match'. Of course, the rest of the T&A pillow fight/(various outfit) contests are also in here. I would say I'm disappointed in the lack of actually matches in the extra's area (Miss Jackie vs Dawn Marie, & Lita vs Trish, where Lita almost broke her neck, are the only 2 worth mentioning), but this year alone has been disappointing for the women's division, with 4 women who can actually wrestle getting released to make way for the 'Diva' Search. Recommended if you have $20 to burn.",1112832000,5,1010,4.554945054945055
2193906,5,B0006SSNXM,"I loved this new Divas dvd.  There's not alot of back shots with Thongs, there's a few tho, so that's better then nothing I guess.  I also found four hidden easter eggs within the dvd.

The first one is under Extras Page 2-click ""Right"" on ""Stacy and Torrie"".

The second is under Chapters Page 1-click ""Left"" on ""Coach with Torrie"".

The third is also under Chapters Page 2-click ""Right"" on ""Maria.""

The final one I found is yet again under Chapters, Page 2-click ""Left"" on ""Trish Stratus.""

I strongly recommend this dvd to any fan of the WWE and or the Divas.

Peace:)",1112745600,5,572,4.485436893203883
2193907,5,B0006SSNXM,"So Hot Want To Touch The Hinny Ahwooooo!
I have no knowledge about the to be released Divas DVD, but what you will see is the hottest totties on the planet, wearing next to nothing. Stacy, Trish, Christy, Victoria, and Dawn Marie will all be featured,  Even though I would not call them Divas Torrie Wilson and Molly will most likely be on it as well. But just getting to see Stacy's ass in a thong makes this DVD a 5 star DVD easy. My heart beets fast just thinking of Trish in a two-piece. You will also see up to ten matches/Diva Contests.",1112486400,,542,4.211538461538462

8042712,5,B0006SSNXM,"Viva Las Divas follows 16 of WWE's divas as the bikini clad beauties of Raw and Smackdown invade the beaches and locales of Mexico! The Coach is the host of this and throughout the dvd he is seen hitting on majority of the divas only to have them reject and embarrass him in each of his attempts. Why on earth they had Coach supervise the divas in the first place was beyond me. But enough about that goofball, lets talk about the divas! You are treated to seeing the divas not only strike breath taking poses along the beautiful beaches of Mexico in their skimpy little bikinis but you also get to see what they do during their down time such as touring shops around the area and racing around on ATVs along the sandy and forest regions of their surroundings. What strikes me is that the obvious cover girl of this dvd, Stacy Keibler is barely featured on here. She makes an appearance during the first maybe 10 minutes of the dvd for her photoshoot and that's it.  She is however featured in a few extras on the disc. While watching this dvd, you'll also realize how good the divas divison still was back then before it began its downfall about a year or two later.

Among the divas that appear on here are (in order): Stacy Keibler, Lillian, Joy Giovanni, Candice Michelle, Victoria, Amy Weber, Michelle McCool, Dawn Marie, Ivory, Maria, Miss Jackie, Melina, Lita, Torrie Wilson, Christy Hemme, and Trish Stratus. If you're a fan of WWE's divas from the past or want to see female bodies exposed in swimsuits, then waste no more time and pick up this dvd! The dvd itself as well as the extras are sure to satisfy you!",1354838400,3,1620,4.469594594594595
8042713,5,B0006SSNXM,"I'm writing this in 2012 and I say that the divas division in WWE is on a downward spiral, so I started watching these dvds again and I didn't think of them too much when I first got them but then I watch them back now I thought ""wow the divas division was so good back then! what happened???""

This dvd has a great mix of the divas from the attitude era in Trish, Lita, Torrie, and a good mix of the later divas very early in their career that would become stars in Melina and Candice. Plus we get to see Lillian!!! Plus this dvd contains probably the greatest women's match ever and that is Trish vs. Lita at Raw 12.6.04. Great dvd!",1332547200,,634,4.112903225806452
