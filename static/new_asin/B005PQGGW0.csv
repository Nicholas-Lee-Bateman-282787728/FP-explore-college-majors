8482593,5,B005PQGGW0,"I love these ""2"" movies. There is a third one that goes the horror-comedy route that I'd rather forget about. HURRY and see these first 2 films. They are vastly superior to the American remake (Quarantine), and a 4th installment is coming later in 2014. It is essential you see these NOW, before previews of the fourth film spoil the surprises for you. The end of both films, if you watch them thru, will chill your blood! And I rarely ever get scared in horror films...",1398211200,,470,4.476744186046512
8482594,5,B005PQGGW0,This is an excellent blu-ray set. The picture and audio is great and the special features are great to see as well. Highly recommended!,1380672000,,135,4.666666666666667
8482595,5,B005PQGGW0,Not all movie producers are the same. The cinema world needs this type of genre to set the bar higher.,1358121600,,102,4.15
8482596,3,B005PQGGW0,"True, the case is nice and sturdy and it is all region blu ray - -bla bla bla.  I have been really looking forward to seeing this movie but I only had one issue.  It is all in subtitles.  If you don't mind reading your movie this is for you.  I thought it would be dubbed but no dice.  As far as the movie itself, I have not made it through yet, again the subtitles.",1353024000,,366,3.8266666666666667
8482597,5,B005PQGGW0,"The set comes with two blu-ray discs. The [REC] 1 & 2 case as you see in the picture on amazon is like the cardboard material. Its sturdy cardboard though. Keeps the discs in place nice and tight. Playable no problem on all Region 1/A (United States) blu-ray players. The picture quality is awesome! 1080p picture quality. They really up the definition in the blu-ray versions of [Rec] and [Rec]2. The sound is twice what it was on the dvd's. Really makes these horror gems all the much more scarier on blu-ray.

If your a fan of these two awesome films and have a blu-ray player this is a ABSOLUTE MUST BUY!",1347667200,10,608,4.428571428571429
8482598,4,B005PQGGW0,"this is one of my favorite movies of akk time. when you go to add cart it says ( rec 1 % 2 dvd blu ray )  but you are really getting the blu ray. this is a all reigion player so it will play on ALMOST any nly ray player, ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1343520000,8,245,3.7115384615384617
