8408069,5,B003XF1VB6,"One of the better Bridey Murphy take-offs of the day and filmed by W. Lee Wilder for an Allied Artists release dirt cheap in NYC in late '56 and released in late '57, this tale had no specific set to speak of.  Every scene utilized an actual location, even an office set up for this purpose.  Frightening?  No, but it sure made for a great one word sell title.  A very decent little cheapie sans FX and with a good story.  I want to mention that the seller was marvelous also.",1513555200,,476,4.186813186813187
