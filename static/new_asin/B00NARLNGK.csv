6621500,5,B00NARLNGK,"Just about 4 months after the release of season 10,CBS/Paramount is about to release season 11 of 32 more remastered episodes of Gunsmoke, the last B/W season. At this pace, it looks like we may get to see the 12th color season by early 2015.

Fans who may be upset with the once again price of $85 for the full season, folks, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT FROM AMAZON. Other reviewers have noted that You can get season 10 at Barnes&Noble for around $50, or part 1 at Walmart for $20, so almost guaranteed that this will also apply to season 11. Or you can wait around a few months for the price to drop by 40% or so as it did for all other seasons, 'hot' items are always reduced when they are no longer hot.

UPDATE NOV.30 - The price for Season 11 has now dropped to $70 and season 10 is now selling for $56, and if you wait around a little longer, it is sure to drop again.

When you look at the amount of run time for some of the most popular series today, like Longmire, Hell On Wheels, or Justified,a full season runs average 9 hours for 13 episodes and pre-order prices range from $30 - $50, Falling Skies seasons are only 10 episodes for about 7 hours. And when you analyze these series, they are basically a lot like a mini-series, a main plotline that basically uses the same cast, few guest appearances, with the same storyline continuing over 10 - 13 episodes, usually ending up in a cliffhanger.

With Gunsmoke, you get 32 different stories, about 28 hours running time, that's 3-4 times more than any of the above mentioned series per season, no cliffhangers, clearly remastered, a costly, timely process, albeit not every episode is a classic, but there are always enough to make you feel satisfied. And you bring back to life, so many cherished all time favorite actors that you never expected to see again, in their prime and glory.

So according to the release pace of this year, now it looks like CBS/Paramount will be releasing 2 seasons of Gunsmoke a year and if this is true, all of us Gunsmoke lovers will be able to complete our collection of 20 seasons within the next 5 years, now that is exciting news!!!.

Some interesting facts about James Arness that you probably didn't know:

Born of Norwegian heritage (the family name, Aurness, had formerly been Aursness) in Minneapolis, Minnesota

His marriage to Virginia Chapman ended in divorce in 1960. They had three children together, one of whom, Jenny Lee, died a suicide in 1975. Arness subsequently married Janet Surtrees in 1978

Older brother of actor Peter Graves.

An infantry soldier during World War II, Arness took part in the landings at Anzio, Italy. It was during this battle that he was shot in the foot and wound up losing part of it, an injury that made it difficult for him to walk for extended stretches

During his service in World War II, James Arness received the Bronze Star; the Purple Heart; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze campaign stars; the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

Was the only actor to appear in all 635 episodes of Gunsmoke (1955).

6621501,4,B00NARLNGK,"Gunsmoke should have switched over to color filming at the start of season 11, as by 1965, CBS was color casting many of it's sitcoms (Gilligan's Island, My 3 Sons, The Beverly Hillbillies) and variety hours (The Ed Sullivan Show, The Red Skelton Show). The abc network had already aired color Wagon Trains and was, by autumn, 1965, broadcasting the color series, The Big Valley. Long running CBS westerns like Rawhide and Gunsmoke, languished in the black and white format, their ratings trailing off, while NBC's color westerns The Virginian and number one rated Bonanza, flourished. Gunsmoke would earn the distinction as the final primetime series to switch to color, which it did with the season 12 opener, Snap Decision, episode #410, on September 17, 1966. Season 11 sees the appearance of Roger Ewing as Thad Greenwood, who succeeded Burt Reynolds. Thad episodes of seasons 11 and 12 are divided into separate syndicated rerun packages of hour black & white, and color. After watching Thad in season 12 color episodes in reruns for decades, I finally got to see what his story was when season 11 became available in reruns. All in all, another fantastic season of Gunsmoke, which should have been in color.",1409961600,18,1214,4.955882352941177

I agree with another purchaser who made the comment: ""Can't you people (meaning the company putting this series out to the market for purchase) give us, ALL AT ONCE, the opportunity to buy the rest of the 20 Seasons that GUNSMOKE ran, ""before we all die""? It's quite funny but also quite true! They certainly DO NOT make shows like this anymore where you know the ""Good Guy"" will always get his man with very, very interesting plot lines. I might be from the old school but when I my Wife & friends sit-down for Television or movie entertainment we would like to see JUSTICE & the Good Guys Win for a change. It kind of takes you a little bit away from the REALITY of really what goes on in life which is for the most part in todays climate the BAD GUY Wins. That is NOT, for the most of us enjoyable to behold & is certainly NOT entertainment.

6621546,5,B00NARLNGK,"Ive been watching this show on METV 6 days a week The first episode had a bunch of gunmen in Dodge out to kill Dillion and in the episode 10 little Indians they said Thad was killed in a shootout in his town but then He did come back in the show .Also in that episode was Warren Oates , Bruce Dern ,John Marley .Since Chester left the stories have got more grittier as  action are in Dodges alley ways , plenty of extras and Guest Stars. Yes its still B/W but this show grew up with it and was one of last to change over and I can say it ended a era with the show . Festus still hasn't yet got popular yet so you get a lot of Dillion in action. A time when they all still looked good in their roles as Kitty is pretty as ever. CBS is too greedy cutting these seasons in half . This season was a big change for Gunsmoke since producer Norman McDonald and long time writer John Meston left the show but the new producer kept the stories the same in this last season in B/W . Very good first Episode when a gang takes over Dodge  and another two part episode called "" The Raid "" , with a bunch famous guest stars . Since its the last season in B/W , this is a season to add to your collection .",1460764800,2,1191,3.877049180327869

6621548,5,B00NARLNGK,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values.  It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons.  I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1459036800,,885,4.966216216216216

6621601,5,B00NARLNGK,"Gunsmoke is a real TV Western classic!  Season 11 is sure to not disappoint as the last season of the TV series filmed in black-and-white.  However, the price is a bit out of my ""comfort zone.""  Ever since, the studios decided to cash in on the consumer by ""double-dipping"" on a season through splitting them in two and charging the same price for a half-season that they used to charge for an entire season, I discriminate more on pricing.  Amazon is a little slow lowering their price on this Season 11 (Vols. 1 & 2).  Word to all other discriminating shoppers:  Each volume (1 or 2) of Gunsmoke: Season 11 was at a low of $19.96 (at Walmart) back on 3/31/15 before coming back up to what it is now (~$26).  Amazon has had this as low as $21.59.  Personally, I can't see paying over $20 per volume.  I've held out on other seasons of Gunsmoke and got most if not all of them below $20.  Just hang in there!  I think it's worth holding out for less.  Once the next season is out especially, this should drop even more.",1427760000,4,1019,4.3052631578947365

6621661,4,B00NARLNGK,"I recently bought volumes 1 and 2 at Walmart, for $40 total. The stories in season 11 are just as entertaining as in seasons 1-9 ( I have not yet purchased season 10, because of the high price). So far I have only watched disc 1 from volume 1, but the audio quality is not very good, IMO, because the background audio volume (for music and sound effects) is annoyingly higher than the speech audio volume. In seasons 1-9 there was a much better balance between the audio volume for actors speaking versus the background music/sound effects. For season 11 I often find it necessary to use the mute button on my remote control during action scenes where actors are not speaking. A poor job by the sound engineer, in my opinion.",1419379200,4,725,4.5

8676890,5,B00NARLNGK,"This is one of my favorite seasons.  It has some really good episodes, including an intense drama with John Drew Barrymore.  He was excellent in the part.  ""Malachi"" is a fun episode with Harry Townes, Jack Elam, and Edward Andrews, all such wonderful actors.  I can watch it over and over again and laugh every time because the actors were so great.  Other shows include Bruce Dern, Warren Oates, Ed Begley, Albert Salmi, Wayne Rogers, Forrest Tucker, Julie Sommars, James Whitmore, Tom Skerritt, Darren McGavin.....the list goes on and on.  Of course, the regular cast is absolutely wonderful!  The guest stars were frosting on the cake.  Great show!",1499472000,4,652,4.972222222222222
