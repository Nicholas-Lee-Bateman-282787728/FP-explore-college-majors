8472184,4,B005GR1FZQ,"What can be written about the Professionals that has not been written about in the comments' section of its YouTube channel? And who would have thought that a show about IT hit man would actually work?

The reason it does is two-fold. One, the script is tight with the jokes continuously rolling out. And secondly, the actors (cast) make it work. If they placed anyone else, the show wouldn't work as well as it does.

While the show maybe low on ""intelligent commentary,"" it is high on laughs. Yes, the disc contains shares the same content as its YouTube channel cousin. The main bonus for owning the disc is being able to watch whenever you want without an Internet connection. It also includes gag reels, a trailer of the theme song, a bonus episode of the crew (Frank and Tim) in their hotel room after VidCon and a skit of two guys selling lemonade 300 style.

So go get it if you want to support the crew!",1360368000,,912,4.449101796407185
8472185,5,B005GR1FZQ,"I'll start with its original and bizarre premise. The professionals help people with software, hardware and common sense issues relating to computers. They're also contract killers. What sort of cold and heartless monsters could murder someone then calmly proceed to help an old lady with her computer? What sort of people could view human lives so flippantly and treat destroying them as just part of their job description?

Well the professionals themselves are likeable and entertaining characters. They wouldn't seem too out of place in an ordinary office. Of course they still have quirks and flaws that can result in some amazing lines and all round entertainment. Series 1 provides enough mystery and excitement to bring out the best of our heroes.",1350259200,,755,5.188524590163935
8472186,5,B005GR1FZQ,"This is one of the best web shows I have seen. I have been hooked on it ever since the first time I seen it, they are in season 2, and hopefully there will be a season 3.",1325548800,,170,3.5
