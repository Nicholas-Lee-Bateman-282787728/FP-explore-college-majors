1334283,5,B00003RQND,"WAVE #8 and SEASON 1 (all episodes) will as always be tremendous.  My only complaint is that a lot of the world won't be able to see these, because they own VCR's rather than DVD players. A consideration on producing these  on both VHS and DVD would be greatly appreciated, not to mention it would  add another 50% to the profit sharing aspect of this business.",955324800,2,361,4.4393939393939394
1334284,5,B00003RQND,"This complete Season One set is a MUST have for any X-Files fan. They quality of each episode is not only amazing, but we can finally watch all 24 UNCUT episodes again. The interviews, Behind the Truths, and extra  goodies are a wonderful gift to us fans. The X-Files has changed the  stereotype of episodic television, and I hope that an annual DVD release of  each season follows. This set is worth every single penny you pay for it!",955324800,10,435,4.481012658227848
1334285,5,B00003RQND,"If you're reading this, you're either already familiar with the X Files (in which case you know you're going to buy it so why bother reading any further), or you're new to the series and want to know if it's worth $90 of  your hard-earned.
Some say X Files is a love it or hate it series.  Well,  I guess I'm in the former category. These first episodes develop the series  scope, the primary characters, and the chemistry between them, that proved  so popular it carried the season through the 1990's.  Being Series 1, there  is not yet any underlying conspiracy story so each episode can be enjoyed  for what it is, rather than in relation to previous events in past series.  The beginning really is the best place to start.
Like one of the other  reviewers I saw most of Series 1 on TV but missed out on the VHS version.  And although I'm  not a deranged X-Phile who trawls the Net for gossip on  the cast, when I heard Series 1 was coming out on DVD I went out and bought  a DVD player in anticipation.  It's that good.
Bottom line is that this  is well worth the cash - and in the highly unlikely event you don't like  it, E-Bay awaits.  One word of caution is that if you do get hooked you can  look forward to parting with paychecks for Series 2 through 8(?).",955324800,24,1266,4.243697478991597
1334286,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files changed televison and spawned many new attempts of sci/fi television. This is an amazing value. Think about it, two shows equal 90 minutes. Thats a whole movie worth of X-File intrigue. Multiply that by 12.  Thats right, 12 movies worth of X-Files! Don't forget the additional  material like interviews and behind the scenes information. That is one  hell of a bargain. I know some of you are saying I've got season one on VHS  already. No you don't. Only some of the episodes were released before. Jump  on this bargain and get all the episodes on superior media (DVD baby!). I  know they always say Trust No One, but trust me on this one. You will not  be let down.",951523200,49,679,4.516393442622951
1334287,5,B00003RQND,"Remember back when The X-Files was still fairly easy to understand?
Relive those magic (and sometimes goofy) moments with this new box set. Sure, half of it has already been released on VHS - but this set includes  some gems that the first couple waves of home video ignored.
Remember  the eternally creepy ""Young At Heart"", or a few unintenionally  silly episodes like ""Space"" or ""Ghost in the Machine""?  Or Nicholas Lea's first X-Files appearance (although not as Krycek)? How  about ""Roland"" or ""Born Again"", which represent some of  the finest moments from the first season? They're all here, alongside other  popular episodes like ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"", ""Deep  Throat"", ""E.B.E."", ""Darkness Falls"" and  ""Ice"" (which is essentially a remake of John Carpenter's The  Thing - but the X-Files does it better)!
For the first time in the U.S.,  you can finally buy a TV program season by season. And plus - these discs  give you trailers, interviews and even some cool DVD-ROM content.
If  only Paramount would do their Star Trek discs this way!",950572800,330,1044,4.931034482758621
1334288,5,B00003RQND,"The VHS edition of season 1 sold out very quickly in the UK and I missed out on it. The DVD edition is one that I do not intend on missing. Each of the season 1 shows sparkled with originality and had an energy that seemed  to deminish as the 'stars' settled into their roles in later seasons. The  PILOT show is incredible, there are the two 'TOOMS' shows, you have the  'THING' show, where Mulder and Scully go through the motions of that  intense movie. The conspiracy elements emerge through this season but do  not dominate it, giving each of the shows an episode feel; a stand alone  feel that makes them easy to watch and enjoy, time and time again. Let's  face it, that is why we buy DVD, to watch again and again. The X-Files  season 1 fits into that catagory. I can't wait.",946598400,17,783,4.27891156462585
1334331,5,B00003RQND,"The early seasons show how edgy in that they are very Hitchcock like. You can tell that by season 4ish the writers had to become more commercial. The show by that point was a cultural phenomenon so the changes can be enjoyed in different ways. What i admire about this show is that even though they toned it down a bit they did it so creatively initially that it is justified as good art.
I love the first season which contained Down By The Sea which had a twin peaks feel and contained a twin peaks actor.
Another example of the mcguffan effect esque style would be the Shapes episode (which contains another twin peaks actor) in that you only see glimpses of the monster and the just a transformation in detail. The first few seasons really had it right.
Also pay attention to the music. It is consistently dark and scary. It began to have fills that lightened up the music in the later seasons.",1521158400,,897,4.409638554216867
1334332,4,B00003RQND,"The discs come in folding cardboard and plastic contraptions. The discs play fine.

The original The X-Files (1993-2002) has some brilliant episodes. I love the sci-fi alien and UFO episodes, but I decided to give the show four stars. The numerous shaky flashlight scenes get tedious after a while. There are way too many scenes of flashlights waving around in dark rooms and pointing at the camera. The other reason is the same problem I have with all the Twilight Zones and Outer Limits and X-Files shows and that is that the episodes are hit and miss. If you're a science fiction fan who doesnt appreciate horror you have to wade through a lot of horror episodes to get to the stuff you love, and often the series are incorrectly labeled by information sources. The X-Files is more of a horror and freak show than anything else, but the first genre label listed on Wikipedia for the show is sci-fi. Ive learned to read more about a show than just looking at genre labels, which I often don't agree with.

For example, the original The Outer Limits is labeled as fantasy, horror and sci-fi on IMDb. The second The Outer Limits (1995-2002) is labeled as drama, fantasy, and horror on IMDb, with no mention of science fiction. Most of The Outer Limits (1995-2002) episodes are horror, but The Light Brigade (1996) episode is an example of outstanding sci-fi, but its incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror on IMDb instead of sci-fi. Quality of Mercy (1995) is another example of a great sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror. Star Crossed (1999) is a third example of a sci-fi episode incorrectly labeled as fantasy and horror by IMDb. Wikipedia is usually a better source of genre information when looking at shows.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,3192,5.250980392156863

1334442,5,B00003RQND,"First of all, let's get this out of the way - This is a 23 year old show.... And most of the people who will buy this are likely to be older fans. For that reason five stars is the only rating possible. The remaster is truly outstanding if you have a Tv to match its quality. How they have managed to format the season into widescreen is remarkable. X-Files has been my favorite show ever mainly for the nostalgia factor as I grew up through High School, college and beyond watching it. I can honestly say watching it in Blu Ray that I am seeing things I have never noticed even after more than half a dozen times watching from my DVD collection. At some points it almost looks like a recent show that they've deliberately tried to film as if it was happening in the 90's. However my main concern would be how dated it has unfortunately become which means that new viewers might be discouraged. But what can we expect for something made 23 years ago, and if you can get past that old factor it is so interesting to see the Mulder/Scully relationship evolve all over again, for me the best acting partnership there has been in TV for both character depth and chemistry. Got this for $10 which is a bargain. Won't be getting the box set but will buy these individually as they slowly drop in price each. X-Files fans, no brainier. New viewers, watch with an open mind and understand that cutting edge FX were just being born when this was being filmed and as such do look dated. Also these sorts of story lines were seen as unheard of in the pre social media era as the Internet was still fairly young. But it is interesting to see how someone like conspiracy theorist Snowden was already being thought of as possible in one of the very first episodes...

1334485,4,B00003RQND,"I have always loved The X-Files. So much so, I gave one of my sons the middle name of Fox, after Agent Fox Mulder. The first season was a combination of hit or miss episodes, because they were trying to determine who their audience was. This season needs to be seen to get to know the main characters Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), and also to get a feeling for the episodic and yet enduring way the series plays on tv. The second and third seasons were where they started to hit their groove. I recommend The X-Files Season 1 to anyone who would like to get to know, or catch up on our intrepid FBI agents, and also to anyone who enjoys mystery, suspense, science fiction, or drama.",1466294400,,723,4.402985074626866

1334494,3,B00003RQND,"I had never watched the X-Files before. I saw the series was available on Amazon Prime and being a Doctor Who fan I figured the X-Files may hold some interest for me. The one word to describe the first season would be inconsistent. There are some truly creepy stories (Ice, Squeeze, Eve, Gender Bender) and some extremely bad, almost tacky stories (Space, Jersey Devil, Fire). For some reason there were several stories involving remote mind control (Young at Heart, Lazarus, Born Again, Roland, with the latter two being back-to-back episodes). I groaned when I recognized the basic plot outline happening again.

The first season stories seemed to be divided into one-off monster stories and those stories involving UFO's and ET's. I much preferred the one-off stories. I can see the series is building to be a predominately UFO themed show (Pilot, E.B.E, Erlenmeyer Flask). I hope I'm wrong, though.

I've noticed that sometimes the reasoning behind Mulder and Scully being involved in investigating these incidents are a bit thin. I would think that a crime needs to be committed before it would get on the FBI's radar. For example, in E.B.E. Mulder and Scully are sent to investigate a possible UFO sighting. Well, if they were sent to investigate all of these sorts of sightings, they would be busy 24/7. I don't remember any crime being committed in this episode. In Erlenmeyer Flask they are called upon to find a man that had eluded local police. Really? That requires the FBI? Also, there seems to be a lot of murders occurring with scarcely a motive (Gender Bender and Young at Heart comes to mind.)

All in all, I liked the first season although there was a wide range of quality. I can only give it three stars.",1466035200,,1724,4.797979797979798
1334495,5,B00003RQND,"X-Files was an awesome series, even before our graphics really took off.  However, I was a quite disappointed that I did not get to watch the rest of Season 1 before Amazon Prime started charging $1.99 for each episode.  It was almost as if Amazon knew I was coming to the end and in order to watch the whole season, they were going to make me pay more (on top of what I already pay for Prime membership).

We decided to re-watch the first season after watching that tenth season. I think that we never saw the first season. Must have started watching during a later season. First season begins to introduce the themes of Scully's romantic interest in Mulder and of the government conspiracy regarding alien visitors. We don't see the ""smoking man"" much in season 1 but we do see Scully back out of a date with a man that she has just met so that she can run off with Mulder on some mission.

SPOILER ALERT!

I think that the alien spacecraft that appears at the end of one of the first season episodes (might have been episode 2) is identical to the one that appears at the end of the last season ten episode. So the writers are trying to close the loop.",1461715200,,923,4.41764705882353

1334801,5,B00003RQND,"Purchasing The X-Files on blu-ray is a no brainer.  The quality increase is amazing and further lends to the motion picture feel of this weekly drama.

Pros:
- Amazing quality increase and much less judder over the DVD version.  I'd estimate the increased resolution is 90% of that observed in modern 1080p video.  That's pretty amazing considering it was shot 20 years ago.  Additionally, the increased bitrate really smooths out motion and reduces motion blur.
- Early seasons are now available in anamorphic widescreen.  It's a genuine widescreen as well since the original was shot in widescreen and cropped down to full screen.  What a difference over the old full screen version.

Cons:
- The blu-ray menus aren't as user friendly as I'd prefer.  The two main menu colors--black and dark gray--make it difficult to determine what menu option is selected.

MediaInfo reports the following video and audio specs.

Average episode size:  10-12 GB
Average overall bitrate:  34 Mbps
Video:  1920x1080 progressive scan, 24 fps, 16x9 aspect ratio
Best audio:  DTS MA/Core, 5.1 channel surround, 48.0 KHz

1334882,5,B00003RQND,"I would give this 4 stars for the season because it reignited my X-Files addiction and left me wanting more and more more, especially since by the third episode, I predicted they were probably going to end it on a cliffhanger and I DREADED that. Cruel love of my generation, I will always come back to X-Files, even as they toy with my emotions.  I bought the season bcuz it was worth it to watch the episodes without the constant interruption of commercials.  David Duchovny fell right into the groove of being my Moulder.  They brought a lot of the relevant players back and it almost felt like seeing old homies, even the villains you love to hate.  I could never give X-Files anything less than top marks. 5 stars over and over again even though they played with the audience's emotions in the cruelest of ways with that cliffhanger.

I have a feeling that new fans from the reboot will probably want to start watching this. It's cool to see some of the very first episodes (Conduit) discuss some of the very same things we just saw in the 2016 mini reboot - alien abductions, being visited by aliens multiple times, things like that. I had often wondered in the '90s if Chris Carter knew how he was going to tie all this together. I love seeing how the writers/producers really studied the origins of the series to come back to us with that reboot that makes us want more. New fans might not be able to have some of the ""aha"" moments, but it's awesome for old fans to revisit.",1457308800,,735,4.294964028776978

1335097,1,B00003RQND,"I apologize for the low rating, it is not a criticism of the show - which deserves all  5 stars - it is a criticism of the poor marketing and the blatant profiteering of Amazon. I've had prime for years, and just in the middle of last night Amazon Prime dropped the X-Files from Prime streaming.  Literally I watched one episode after midnight, turned on a movie, and came back to watch the X-Files around 4am Est.  In that three hour gap access to the X-Files was restricted to those who were willing to pay $20 / season.  I already pay per season for newer shows like The Legend of Korra, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gotham, and Agent Carter. I've got no problem doing that, because it helps keep those new shows on the air and I enjoy the service's lack of commercials.  However when I pay $100 for Prime, I'm not going to pay per season (or per episode) for any show that is two decades old.  Just isn't happening.

Sometime 4:00AM EST and 12:30PM EST, Amazon has moved many/most episodes of the X-Files back to Amazon Prime, while leaving some episodes up for purchase only.  I guess I should be saying, 'Thank You.' In reality I am considering dropping Prime once the subscription runs it's course, and going back to Netflix.",1456963200,2,1227,4.495495495495495

1335272,5,B00003RQND,"I read many of the reviews (good and bad) and considered them carefully before I finally decided to order Season 1 as an upgrade to the original DVD box set.  I was particularly concerned about some of the negative reviews, which did influence some hesitation.  But then, I thought, given the price, can absolute perfection be expected?

Now I'm really happy I bought the set.  In fact, I was so pleased with the release that I have subsequently ordered additional seasons.

I didn't think the 16:9 reframing detracted from the presentation of each episode, in fact the opposite, in many cases the presentation looked tighter and increased the drama.  Regarding an up conversion of some scenes - yes, I can notice if I'm really looking for it, but it didn't disappoint my enjoyment of the episode.  They are too few of them to worry about it.  I was not effected by the font change as some viewers expressed.  In fact it didn't bother me at all.  I really enjoyed the improvement in the sound compared to the previous DVD box set.  Not much more I can say about that. For reference, my viewing environment is a dedicated room with projector and calibrated audio system.

As mentioned earlier, I wasn't expected absolute perfection for the price, however, I got more value from the release than I was expecting.

I will collect the rest of the seasons over time (and hopefully by the time I get to Season 8, the discs will be the corrected pressing!)",1456099200,4,1449,4.65748031496063

1335318,3,B00003RQND,It seems to get better as the season moves on. One thing different is that it is not an ongoing story. Each show is a different one as it would be a different X file for each story. Only gave it 3 stars because it seems that Mulder and Scully are new to the roles and in the beginning shows they seem a little blocky as if they are reading their lines. Their acting does seem to get better as the shows moves from its infancy stages though. I have not finished it yet so will review again at a later date. I do love sci-fi so I was able to  put up with the no so great acting in the early parts.,1455667200,,595,3.83739837398374

It's hard for me to look at shows that are post-Cold War/fall of the USSR and pre-9/11 without thinking them dated.  We still had a manned space program.  There'd been no dot-com bubble or mortgage lending bubble.  Scully and Mulder look like high school students.  The scariest things out there were the monsters of the week.

That said one can see the slow burn igniting between the two leads.  Deep Throat's arc is great.  I'm looking forward to what comes next.",1455580800,,617,4.5963302752293576

1335559,5,B00003RQND,"It was great to see the old episodes again, and I really appreciate them being on Prime(which I recommend to all my friends who use Amazon, the benefits are well worth the price). I think they hold up very well, although it's kind of nostalgic to see the old cell phones. Duchovny and Anderson have always had a great chemistry together and each episode is almost like a movie in itself.
  I hope the people who haven't seen the originals will take the time to check these out. As with all series there are a few less than spectacular episodes but all in all I still think it's one the best ever television series and still worth watching. There are also many innovations they used which other series adopted. One of the best things about the show was they always maintained a sly sense of humor though sometimes a bit macabre.

Prime should give you something. The first episode is crucial to really understanding this series fully. No matter -- I got access somewhere else so I could view the pilot and know the full premise. Viewers have enjoyed this unique and imaginative show and it's easy to see why. There is a counterbalance between the two leads -- he's a believer, she's a skeptic. They have this electricity between them and it's wonderful to watch. They play off each other to perfection. In so many of the episodes there really is something unexplainable going on. The special effects and production values are excellent. In the first season there is a focus on UFO's, conspiracies and government cover-up. There are, of course, detours to other paranormal activity that are just as thrilling to watch.",1454976000,3,945,4.875776397515528

1335744,5,B00003RQND,"Bought the set from WalMart for $20, should've saved $10 and bought at Best Buy. Anyway onto the review since I know everyone, most know about the show itself. It's a great presentation of a show that's almost as old as I am. The 1080P transfer makes everything lol great, yes there's a little grain, not artifacting but grain. The series was made on film, and was intentionally a little darker to fit the mood, this the natural film grain will show. It's also in 1.78 (16x9) widescreen, a huge plus since most of my other TV series on BD are 16x9 since that's the new standard, and no the picture doesn't suffer for it, it's actually helped by it. The sound is great, both Dolby Digital and DTSHD-MA codecs for those who prefer either Dolby or DTS surround, personally both are good, but I prefer DTS. They also throw in 2.0 audio for those who can't get 5.1, which honestly is still very possible, so it's nice it's thrown in. The package is simplistic, could've given us an actual booklet like the Terminator Sarah Connor Chronicles season 1&2 set, but that's an esthetic problem, not worth any point loss since the show is what your paying for.",1454544000,,1148,4.524038461538462
1335745,4,B00003RQND,I like the premise of the show and the ensemble cast so far.  I have only watched 5 episodes of season 1 but it has kept my interest and I'm always amazed when the episode is over - so soon?,1454544000,,190,3.75
1335746,5,B00003RQND,"Season 1, Episode 2 is a perfect lead in to Episode 1 of this new 2016 season.  If you've never seen X-Files before, episodes 1 and 2 will provide a wonderful foundation.  . .(not as much fun as watching all seasons, though)  if finding the time to ""catch up"" is a challenge . . Hints or appearances of everything I loved about the original X-Files (except the Lone Gunmen) is in the early episodes.",1454544000,,399,4.364864864864865

I don't know if most people are as close minded about extraterrestrials as the ""public"" is portrayed to be, but at the time the series was shot maybe people were. Times have changed.

This has given me a new appreciation for the show and the episodes still hold up. The story and chemistry between Mulder and Scully help you past the early 90's TV camera, music, etc. If you weren't at least a teen when this came out it might be more difficult to get past the production quality of the time.",1453593600,,442,4.273809523809524

Apparently the original film has been scanned and watching on Amazon provides a 16:9 HD experience - so much better than the original SD broadcast years ago.  As for the show, what more can I say?  It's the X-Files.  Watch a few episodes and you'll understand the massive following.

Bought from my local Wal-Mart.

I loved and still love all the episodes in the X-Files series! Not one i didn't like!

The X-Files in 16:9 high definition Blu ray! Been a huge fan since season 1 and i finally get to re live these massive TV moments in awesome detail and quality!

Being a believer of the paranormal and government conspiracies i instantly got turned on to this excellent show!

In most episodes, Mulder and Scully investigate paranormal happenings that defy the laws of nature or the universe. Scully proves to be ever the skeptic she set out to be, never being convinced of Mulder's work.

Should you pick this up if you are a fan? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Positively!

I will be slowly collecting the whole series!",1450483200,,796,4.524475524475524

1336359,5,B00003RQND,"It's been worth the wait, but the entire series has now been remastered in high definition on blu ray.  There's  angst among some of the faithful over the fact that seasons 1 -4 have been remastered in widescreen 16:9.  Although there's some conflicting information on the internet as to whether or not there first four seasons were actually filmed in widescreen or whether the top and bottom have been cropped in order to appear as such--the results look splendid.

Having watched the first two seasons and part way into the third, my reaction is that 20th Century Fox has done a beautiful job and the images look just fine.  In truth, the show will never look as good as it does now on blu ray.  And it's a wonderful lead in towards the new mini series which is to premiere in January.",1449878400,,787,4.507042253521127
1336370,4,B00003RQND,"The truth is on this Blu-ray. I wanted to believe that this was going to be a terrific transfer and, largely, it is.

The first season of ""The X-Files"" borrowed from a variety of great sources--the first season of ""Twin Peaks"", the movie ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" even some of the moody TV series being shot in the UK. What made the series unique was how well it mixed and matched these elements but, more importantly, the chemistry between the leads in the series.
W
The transfer is nearly flawless with a nice, detailed, film-like quality to the transfer with very few detectable visual flaws. These have been painstakingly re-scanned in 2K from the original negatives (why not 4K? Fox was trying to save money I suppose) with the exception of the stock footage and visual effects created in SD on videotape were upscaled from SD as there are no camera negatives to work with and due to cost.

The downside for many fans will be that the first four seasons have had the image changed from full screen to widescreen in HD. How was this done? There's a portion of the frame referred to as the ""safety area""--this are at the side edges of the image that weren't intended to be seen. Usually that's because you can see lighting rigs, the edge to the sets, etc.  Luckily for ""The X-Files"" (unlike ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" by comparison) that wasn't the case and it allows for expansion of the image . I will say that the head room IS a bit tight compared to before (they have to crop a bit from the top and bottom to expand it to fill the screen) at times but, over all, its a pretty good job of re-framing the original image. It would have been nice if they had taken the time to include those as an option as well for fans but the new scans are such a remarkable upgrade, I can forgive them for not including that as an option.

The moody photography finally gets its due on home video. Detail is remarkable and this is very much comparable to the ""Twin Peaks"" blu-ray release the difference, though, is that ""Twin Peaks"" features brighter colors simply by virtue of the fact that was how Lynch wanted it vs. Chris Carter who wanted a more muted tone to the show. The colors look terrific.

The series began to hit its stride with season two but season one had some terrific episodes mixed in with some duds. The growing pains of a freshman series isn't unusual the first season of ""The X-Files"" holds up well 22 years from its debut in 1993.

The 5.1 remix sounds very nice and, even when listened in stereo, the dialog is largely clean and clear without the muddled quality of many shows from the same time frame.

The audio 2.0 tracks are available in English, German, French and Spanish as are the subtitles.

All of the special features from the DVDs (except the games that were introduced) have been carried over to this set including the documentary produced for the repackaged themed sets focusing on the mythology of the series. We also get the commentary tracks that came with the original sets as well (although it would have been nice to get more) which is a nice touch.

If you haven't seen the pilot in a while, you get a sense from the writing of Chris Carter that he had some idea where he wanted to go with the series. Now he may have made up many of the details as he went along but, like ""Twin Peaks"", the series had a solid story arc established immediately in the pilot that was sustained during the first season (for one subplot) and through most of the series (for another involving Mulder's sister).

There's no booklet but Fox has provided us with an episode guide printed on the flip side of the cover art (which, while interesting, looks a little too photoshopped for my taste but it's not a make or break deal any more than the menu for the series being pretty straight forward. A couple of reviews have noted the lack of imagination but, honestly, I could care less about what the menu looks like particularly if it consumes bit space at the expense of the visuals.

As of this writing, the individual sets are cheaper than the boxed set and, beyond the fact that there is a slot for the 2016 mini-series, there's really no reason to pick up the boxed set unless you want something big to store them in as there's nothing special IN the set by itself.

Should you pick this up if you are a fan? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Positively.",1449705600,57,4371,4.43640897755611
1336371,5,B00003RQND,"If you like the X-Files, then you know the show and likely already own the DVDs.  This review will not cover the show itself, which could be hit or miss and might feel a bit dated for some viewers. I wanted to discuss the picture and audio quality for those of you looking to upgrade from your old DVDs.  The Blu Ray is far better than the DVDs previously available and at the price, it is a no brainer for any X-Files fan.  The shows are now in 16:9 widescreen with 5.1 surround sound.  Some episodes are limited by poor source material, but overall, these look great.  The Pilot episode was pretty rough on DVD and on this set it looks pretty good.  The audio is a bit nasaly and the video a bit dull and grainy, but considering the previous version this is a huge improvement.  The framing looks great and you don't see the clumsy looking shots that can occur shen 4:3 is resized to 16:9.  After the Pilot, the picture and audio improve and get better as the episodes go along.

Long story short, it will never look like a show shot in 2015, but considering when it was filmed, it looks fantastic.  The effort put in to making the episodes look this good clearly shows.  The conversion to widescreen and 5.1 has been done with great care.",1449705600,15,1241,4.329004329004329
1336372,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files is a science fiction horror drama that ran for nine seasons from 1993-2002. The two principle characters are Fox Mulder(David Duchovny) and Dana Scully(Gillian Anderson) who are FBI agents who specialize in investigating paranormal phenomena.
The blu-ray episodes look great and appear to have been remastered and cleaned up. The first four seasons are also now in anamorphic widescreen. I checked one frame of one episode in order to see what the image looked like in comparison to the DVD, and there is much more image on both sides such that the whole screen is filled on a flat screen TV. So there is actually more of the original image showing from the original master negative, as opposed to the image simply being stretched to fill the screen. There was also a bit more on the top, but a bit less on the bottom of the image of the blu-ray compared to the DVD's full frame image (which showed black bars on the sides of a flat screen TV). The sound is in 5.1 HD Master Audio surround sound as opposed to 2.0 on the DVDs. Some of the images occasionally appear to have been shot with a lower resolution, or are slightly out of focus, so they still look grainy, though in most cases the images look pristine in 1080p with much more clarity overall. And it appears that most of the special features from the Collector's Edition sets have been included. All in all these episodes look great and fresh.",1449619200,12,1415,4.574803149606299

1336471,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files has become iconic and revisiting the first series after more than two decades reminds us of why. The concepts behind the program are complex yet accessible. Although it is in itself not particularly original, the ways in which the series nuances old ideas and combines them with new ones, makes it rewarding to see how very good the X-Files early series were.

The first series succeeds in creating stories and characters that resonate with viewers, building a credible, exciting dramatic world that appeals to viewers intelligence. Each episode is self-contained, though a number of them are thematically linked, beginning to create the X-Files mythos by hinting at an extraordinary confluence of conspiracies and secrets, government manipulation and deception. The monster of the week episodes are more stand-alone but still contribute to creating the X-Files demimonde.

The series has been rightly praised for the quality of its storytelling. Even old horror/sf tropes, the werewolf for example, are given new life by being worked into the evolving X-Files narrative. It doesnt always work; a few episodes show signs of being formulaic and the special effects are at times amateurish.

The lead characters are strong from the beginning and although there is already a bit of typecasting in how Mulder and Scully each play out in various episodes, their dialogue is scintillating and their on screen presence is compelling. Scullys trajectory through the first series is the more interesting of the two  she grows and changes whereas Mulder remains implacably Mulder.
Little wonder the series spawned mountains of books, merchandise, websites and a fanatical world-wide following.

It did not invent the genre (let us not forget 'Kolchak: the Night Stalker'), but has done more than any other to develop our popular mythology of UFOs, psychic powers, and government coverups. The first season is slightly uneven as it finds its feet, but I was impressed to find some of the more effective episodes there in the first year--watching it on broadcast TV, the rerun episodes get jumbled out-of-order, so I simply assumed the better ones were later. One pleasant surprise is that the Scully/Mulder relationship was there from the beginning, feeling natural and uncontrived. Hooray for good acting and writing!",1447027200,,693,4.982758620689655

Sure, there are plenty of cheesy episodes (and atrocious computer special effects such as the tiny green bugs) but the stories, the acting and the creepy Canadian scenery is fantastic. Mark Snow's music was just perfect for the show, and he really seemed to be at the top of his game in the earlier episodes. While horror is the theme of most episodes, its the conspiracy-themed ones I find especially compelling (particularly ones like 'Erlenmeyer flask') with Mulder's character completely driven to find the truth out.",1444608000,,597,5.1020408163265305

1336762,5,B00003RQND,"I remember watching X-Files Season 1 in real time on TV, which is cool for nostalgia's sake; but until I screened it twenty years and more later on Prime I just didn't ever actually get what they were dealing with or talking about.  So do yourself a favor and skip to the end = Episode 24 The Erlenmeyer Flask and watch that; then go back to the beginning Ep 1 et seq.  It's great stuff.  It's a parable about conspiracies; hoaxes; and how you can't tell the difference between such things and what is going on all around you, right now.  Put it this way:  Agent Scully just can't believe it when The CrewCut Man gets back out of his van; turns around; and shoots Deep Throat dead, just like that.  She goes over to deal with him medically, knowing that it's hopeless -- he's been shot point blank by a professional assassin -- and she gets this dedicated guy in his last words on Earth saying, ""Trust No One.""  Do you really think drama gets better than that?  No , it does not.",1443484800,,979,4.282608695652174

1336799,5,B00003RQND,"This is a multi-season successful paranormal mystery series starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson which aired in the early 90's. The recurring plot involves FBI partners whose specialty is investigating paranormal and UFO incidents. Scully (Gillian Anderson) is the agent who is assigned to attempt to debunk the X-file investigations. But, she almost always gets drawn in to Mulder's (David Duchovny) version of the investigation. This, along with the subtle sexual tension between the two propels the series. An interesting, enjoyable series for any sci-fi fan. Look for an episode with a young Jack Black involving lightning!  Five biased stars because I love UFO/paranormal stuff. Enjoy!",1443139200,,698,5.584905660377358

Rewatching it has been worth the while. The X-Files was always something of a hit or miss kind of show, but even then, in the first several seasons, it had few episodes that were truly bad and enough episodes that were very good that it kept the series fresh and interesting. It has aged surprisingly well given its emphasis on things like current culture and technology, meaning that my second watch has been more enjoyable than I expected. The X-Files remains one of the best sci-fi shows ever shown on television and will rank among the all-time greats of 90s television.",1440115200,,715,4.637795275590551

Looks like it is high definition and the widescreen transfer doesn't seem to crop the image.  I have all episodes on DVD and much prefer to watch them on the Fire box now.  Sound quality is ok.  Shows as Dolby Digital Plus on my receiver.

Of course the episode content would merit 5 stars on its own, but the enhancement in presentation through Amazon is greatly appreciated.

1336950,5,B00003RQND,"A classic series. What I am most impressed about is how well the X-files has aged. The content is fun and the conspiracy to suppress proof of extra terrestrial life is just as compelling as it was in the 90's. It helps that the show is not being presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio like some other older TV series (Star Trek Next-Gen I'm looking in you direction). Maybe the digital capture was a full re-master I'm not sure but it looks great on my Amazon Fire TV. Suffice to say, this is definitely not the version unearthed from your college era VHS collection. That said the X-files was good back in the 90's and it's still good today Perhaps no better, certainly no worse.",1439769600,,673,4.392

Now, i consider it one of the best scifi shows that has ever been created. Character development is great and even minor characters add substance to the plot of any given episode. The main story is always exciting and keeps the audience on the edge. Even the stand alone episodes are great.

I'd forgotten the genesis of some of the threads that were woven throughout the entire run. The chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson is artfully developed, as was Mulder's relationship with the enigmatic ""Smoking Man"". The mixture of humor and horror ensures that this series is never too heavy or slow. The first season is very special because it was a crap shoot.

With the new episodes coming soon and all the people I know excited about that, I felt like I had missed out, so I started watching. I have to say, for the most part I wasn't greatly impressed. There were some absolutely great episodes, but also a lot of very mediocre ones. But I also know that there are other great TV shows that had lousy first seasons (I'm looking at you Star Trek: TNG), and the final episode was very good, so I'm still holding out hope and I'm starting the second season.

Having made it to season three this time, I realized again why I absolutely love this show. The writers consistently came up with extremely original ideas, ones that I would never have been able to imagine. Even though the main premise of the show deals with extraterrestrial life, other oddities were tossed into the mix. And wow, who came up with the names Scully and Mulder? Fantastic. The names of the show's protagonists are as unique as the cases their FBI superiors sent them to investigate. Chills for days. If you want to be spooked, yeah ""Spooky Mulder"" check it out.

Wow, it's hard to believe it was the 1990s, but that is somewhat evident. It's weird to watch a show where there are no cell phones (used in every screen shot like todays programs).  They do a lot of stuff old school. (Pencil? Pen? Paper? Phonebook? What's that?)

While the background environments are a little dated, the stories hold up well, thanks to good writing. So it's easy to follow each episode and watch the two stars get used to their characters (they look so young!). It's been to long, and I don't remember all the shows, so many of the episodes are somewhat new to me. Now I can get caught up all over again. If a new movie comes out, I should be up t speed. LOL

1337597,5,B00003RQND,I'm actually re-watching this series from the beginning.  I was hooked from the pilot the first time it aired in the nineties and I thought this was a good time to watch whole thing again before the 6 new episodes are aired on FOX in the future.  I'm not one to go back and watch things more than once but The X files is one of my favorite shows.ever.  I think it's as good the second time around as it was the first time I watched it.  Gillian Anderson and David D. develop a chemistry by episode 6 or 7 and it just keeps getting better.  If you're a bit older and enjoyed Kolchack: The Night Stalker series from the seventies then you will love The X Files.

1337628,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files was an excellent well made, and original series developed by Chris Carter & David Duchovny founded upon the superstitious conspiracies developed during the long Cold War, & the modern legends of UFO abductions.

 One thing about the ""X-Files"" that makes the show work so well is the low key music, mostly piano tunes that really bring the feel of the show and the atmosphere.  The show's tunes make the action or the mystery plots move forward in a captivating way.  Another item one also sees often in most of the episodes of this series is that they seemed to like to film in and around the North Western region of America and Canada, I believe Vancouver had been a primary filming location for the series.  You see the elements of them driving along the highway with the woods in the background and the bright eerie lighting that could be a UFO always lurk around haunting the audience.  This show's style and development was very clever.

 The character FBI Agent Mulder is a renegade outsider who purposely seeks strange, exotic, and mysterious unsolved cases in his die hard unending quest to find the hidden truth about space aliens, flying saucers, and alien abduction (including the kidnapping of his sister by a sinister space alien plot).

Through out this series we never really know if powerful members with in the US government are hiding a secret agenda with hostile alien forces, always foiling from behind the scenes any justified investigative attempts made by Mulder and his highly scientific and skeptical partner Dana Skully played by Gillian Anderson.

 I really loved this show when it first premiered, and the first two seasons along with the first movie, ""X-Files Fight the Future"" were outstanding, but after a while like other series this show just went on far too long and collapsed with in it's own success and weight to the point of nonsensical lunacy.  When the actor from ""Terminator 2"" shows up as Agent Doget, that was pretty much the end on top of the constant themes of first Skully being kidnapped by aliens, and then Mulder being kidnapped by aliens later on just became ridiculous.

The first episodes were the best where Mulder has to dodge hidden agents working for this space alien controlled hidden syndicate, such as members of the Air Force, Army, CIA, and FBI working secretly not for America but for the aliens themselves.  We have a great episode where Mulder & Skully take on a Werewolf, followed by one of my other favorite episodes where this super computer machine takes over this office building the kills a number of corporate executives who get in it's way.  Then there is that classic UFO crash scene, ""Air Force"" episode where a spaceship crashes and Mulder races against time trying to investigate while a hidden government force is trying to stop him along the process.

 We later learn from the movie that the conspiracy, mostly focused and run by this high end mysterious Englishman working in conjunction with the CIA's hidden evil boss ""The Smoking Guy"", are the two men behind many of the plots Mulder tries to expose.

 We also have a very awesome character played by the actor who had major character roles in tv shows and films such as Sly Stallone's ""Cobra"", along with ""Star Trek"" named the Alien Bounty Hunter.  Mulder runs into this very cool and tough, ""Boba Fett"" like dude who has a number of talents and exotic powers at his disposal.  This dude is clearly a force to be reckoned with, and his agenda really isn't too clear but he acts as a hunter of men, and also an occasional assassin working for this powerful English man and the sinister ""Smoking Guy"" during different episodes.

 Mulder has a few hidden but also equally connected friends who for their own reasons try to help him in his quest, be it for reasons that they want the ""Smoking Guy"" stopped and exposed, they want revenge themselves, or for Patriotic reasons we really do not know.

 Also the fun and very comedic but important ""allies and friends"" in the series make appearances from time to time named, the ""Lone Gunmen"".  These guys are conspiracy experts who found ways of finding the truth that the US government censors or wants to keep hidden from society.

 The first 2 seasons of X-Files are great, as well as the first film, ""Fight the Future"".  David Duchovny & Gillian Anderson really had done great work, & I believe those seasons with the film are worth your time and money if you are a serious Sci Fi fan.
 Very fun and entertaining deep thought provoking, chilling, eerie, and weird science fiction master piece show / movie franchise worth your time.  Two thumbs up and an A for ""X-Files"".",1426377600,,4662,4.739776951672862

1337770,5,B00003RQND,"The X Files was one of those series either you got or you didn't.  Chris Carter rightfully decided this show wasn't for everyone and he wasn't filming for everyone.  He was filming for those who wanted to watch something a little different, a little odd, a little controversial and damn good.

For the one or two people who have somehow missed out on this, David Duchovny plays Agent Fox Mulder, a man with a mission of finding his sister.  Mulder believes in his heart of hearts his sister is still ""out there"" somewhere.  Mulder also believes his sister was likely to have been abducted, probably by aliens.  Mulder has been relegated to the bowels of the FBI Building.  There he builds his own kingdom with himself at the center.  Enter Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson).  At first sent to keep an eye on Mulder and report back to the powers what ""Spooky"" (his FBI Academy nickname) is doing.  Slowly Scully is drawn into Mulder's world.

Chris Carter knows how to keep someone's attention.  Like all good filmmakers and writers he knows you don't always have to show your cards.  Sometimes it is best if only one or two cards in your hand are even shown and only then as a quick glimpse.  Chris Carter is also a master of lighting.  Shadows play an important role in The X Files.  Things that go bump in the night become the norm for the series.  Occasionally something or someone shows up one or two times.

The X Files made converts of millions.  Fox, the network, not the person, knew after a short while it had a hit on its hands.  Considering it ran for nearly 10 years, a hit it was.",1421107200,,1596,4.475694444444445

1337831,5,B00003RQND,"I've been watching, from the beginning, the X-files.  I saw some episodes first run, some more episodes in syndication, but realize I'd only seen maybe 20% of the X-files.  So here I am in my third week of watching everday (probably an average of 4 eps a day), plus the movie in the correct order.

This show is consistently intelligent, interesting. scary, funny, fun and whacky.  I watched every episode with interest and, while I'm still in Season 8, this show could have gone on with a change of cast.  It could have been the Law & Order -- it should have been, dammit.  Such great story telling.

Random thoughts.  Gillian Anderson is unbelievable.  I know she's gone on to great acclaim and done other things, but her work in the X-files is extraordinary.  But everyone knows this.  I would like to say something on behalf of Duchovny.  Yes, the man is easy on the eyes, but I will say right here -- he CAN act, he's NOT wooden and the X-files would not be the treasure it is today with out him.  That deadpan, hooded look shows his inteliigence.  Maybe you wanted something else, but there's a zillion scenes with Anderson that show how good both of them are.  One in particular, in the 7th season between the two of them is heartbreaking and he pulls his weight with her.  He's a solid, intelligent presence in this show and should be applauded for his incredibly important contribution.  I can't see anyone else in the role of Mulder.

I have always liked Patrick and it's a thankless job to come in and replace a beloved lead.  But Patrick is terrific in this and the writers could not have done a better job to move the story, the characters and their relationships along.

Treat yourself.  I'm getting close to the end and after I savor my experience may rewatch.  Thank you Amazon Prime for giving me the opportunity to watch this.

And thank you, Chris Carter.  You are a frickin' alien, and I mean that in the best way possible.",1419379200,,1943,4.501432664756447

1337964,5,B00003RQND,"The FBI calls him ""Spooky"", sticks him down in the basement and gives him all the cases that it wishes didn't even exist.  Then they give him a female medical doctor agent who can keep tabs on him.  Enter Dana Scully.

This series was a magical combination of many factors. Mulder & Scully were a dream pairing of FBI agents. As opposites in point of view regarding strange happenings, they nevertheless had a magnetic attraction for one another. This the viewer is immediately sucked into, right along with all the inexplicable phenomenon the agents investigate. The first season may even be the very best one because they are both so fresh and young plus the concept is so fresh. Another aspect which is hard to put into a show like this was put in somewhat effortlessly: humor. There are some episodes which are laugh out loud funny. If one of them is going to be the butt of humor it is typically Mulder who bears that brunt.

There was a great deal of talent behind the scenes too. Vince Gilligan of ""Breaking Bad"" fame, as its creator, created many of the episodes for this show. On one of them, in a further along season, he used Bryan Cranston, who was so good with Mulder than Gilligan later used him as the lead in ""Breaking Bad."" Chris Carter was the overall creator of this show and although he has done other things since, none comes close to his achievement here.

What gets Mulder going on aliens, ghosts, monsters, etc., is his conviction that his sister was abducted by aliens when they were both children. As he gets further into investigating her abduction, there are many long term plot threads which flow from that idea. Personally I liked the individual episodes with their own strange phenomenon rather than this long term story arc. But it too had its fans.

1337967,4,B00003RQND,"If you like your TV shows with tightly written scripts, where everything makes sense, then you will be disappointed.  Watching the X-Files is more akin to a walk through a haunted house on Halloween, where the scary effects don't have to make sense in order to give you a case of the heebie-jeebies.

In the X-Files, all paranormal phenomena are shown to be real, that abductions by space aliens are common and their spaceships often crash, that the government is conducting unconscionable experiments and other immoral deeds, and, of course, that there are those who are determined, at all costs, that none of these dirty little secrets leak out.  Unfortunately for certain named and unnamed government bodies, it is impossible to keep the lid on; some incidents are bound to end up being investigated by the FBI.  Fortunately, these cases end up in the Bureau's X-files to be forgotten.  Unfortunately, there is a loose cannon at the FBI named Mulder.

Special agent Fox Mulder is obsessed with the bizarre cases.  While there are those who want to fire Mulder, there are others who feel it best to keep Mulder on the inside to keep an eye on him;  special agent Dana Scully is assigned to partner with Mulder and report back.  One thing they hadn't counted on, was that Mulder had a deep source, an uncertain ally who prompts him with doubtful truths and believable lies . . . .

Extras: (1) Deleted Scenes: ""Pilot.""  (2) Special Effects Clips: ""Fallen Angel.""  (3) International Clips (Japanese, German, Spanish, & Italian): 9 episodes.

1338016,5,B00003RQND,"For years I chose not to have a television (since 1993) and so I missed out on a GREAT MANY wonderful shows. In the past year I have been ""catching up"" so to speak. (When I stopped watching and got rid of my previous set, I was totally disillusioned with everything the medium was offering).

Since becoming re-acquainted with television, I have discovered, in particular, ""SVU"", ""OZ"", ""Behind Mansion Walls"", and many others that have captured my attention. Chief amongst these is this series, ""The X-Files""......it has been a very long time, indeed since a show has captivated me so much....perhaps all the way back to ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" and, of course, ""Star Trek"".

The level of story content and plot, special effects, and humanity woven into this show's episodes are just wonderful!

I cannot recommend this series to you (if you have never seen it before as I had not) highly enough for your enjoyment and for possible ""things to think about"".......

Five Stars simply are NOT enough as a ranking for this thoroughly engaging, weird, suspenseful show.

1338050,5,B00003RQND,"It's been 20 years and I'm so glad it's still out there. What a fun show. I can't be objective about this because I was such a fan as a kid. And now, I'm just loving the made for TV technology they use, the old cell phones - they didn't get cell phones until the middle of the season. Answering machines!!

And though it's been 20 years, the stories still hold up. A new breed of species emerging from the radiated human waste? Intergalactic beings thwarting our efforts? Government conspiracy? You betcha!

I also love all the camera work, what they did for flashlights in film ... there's a lot of art in the production component. Lots and lots of backlighting!

Another thing I love about this series is that I don't feel like I have to marathon through them. I can watch one and go to bed. Not like some other modern series where we won't even watch it until the whole thing is released so that we can watch them all at once - to save all the teeth gnashing and hand wringing.

Truth be told, I have only seen the first four episodes, but I think I get the idea. The two agents investigate weird stuff, and weird stuff happens. I get the point. Is there more? There seemed no hint of it in what I saw so far, and frankly I'm not sure I want to see more instances of strange phenomena upsetting and confusing people's lives for their own sake.

1338067,5,B00003RQND,"Before the show became a phenomenon, the first season of the X-files seems to have had a smaller production budget along with storylines that were ominous, vague and a less clearly realized conspiracy.  For me, a fan since the pilot originally aired, this worked.  The show had passion and a fantastic sense of growth, that there was so much more to come.  The later seasons delivered until the final seasons when it became a bit of a sci-fi soap opera.  A brilliant soap opera, but a soap opera nonetheless, with Scully looking more chic with each episode and the X-files team somehow now at the center of the vortex rather than the detectives dedicating their lives to pursuing and exposing the truth.
Later seasons would give some of the most brilliant and heartfelt shows in television history.  Season one is more grounded and growing.  It shows the gradual development of Mulder and Scully from strangers assigned to work together, to partners who learn to count on each other, into a genuine, palpable friendship.  The foundations of other key characters, including Cigarette Smoking Man and Skinner, are deftly laid and slowly develop.  A revelation here and there, hint at an overarching plan, involving various alien races and government/international involvement, though never giving away too much.
It's in many ways, a less is more season, that I find I often prefer to the later, polished show it would become.",1405900800,,1423,4.974683544303797

Tobe believable considering the things we know she has seen they needed little interludes at the beginning of a show or two where she & Mulder are returning from what turns out to be nothing or a big hoax.

I didn't start watching X-Files when it first aired and, although I've seen a lot of episodes on re-runs, there are still a bunch that I've missed.  So, I decided to start at the beginning and watch every episode.  It will take a while but I'm really enjoying it.  The writers on this show did a great job of producing interesting stories week after week and season after season.

1338104,5,B00003RQND,"This series is one of the best ever produced. It quickly became not only a generally popular show, but piqued the interests of many people who have become true fans of this wonderful series. Whether or not you believe in extraterrestrials is unnecessary. The stories told in each season are compelling and the myth arc of the series is a magnet to many viewers.

Each episode was produced as if it were a film. They used ideas for telling their well-written stories which lead you to believe everything is more than just a serial television program, but an expose' of factual events. In some episodes, there are a few tongue-in-cheek scenes and lines which are pulled off quite well. The acting is superb in each episode, with the main characters becoming more believable with each story.

The entire 9-year series is, without a doubt, a seminal production. Homage to the creators, writers, actors, directors, producers, and every member of the crew in Vancouver and Hollywood is seen in many newer programs such as ""Fringe"". While some people may feel it lasted too long, I see the last few years being very innovative and leading towards a continuation of the characters which never fully developed either on television or in the theaters.

Fox had a chance to capitalize on the following of the many millions of fans, but procrastinated so long that when the second feature film appeared, it had no real story line which could have pulled in the series' myth arc. In doing so, an opportunity was lost and one which will likely never be recaptured. The actors are now older and while they might be interested in continuing the story on film, I cannot see Fox putting the money in-place as did others with the Star Trek series of films (an overall highly successful series). [Not that I know anything from behind the scenes, as I can assure you that I am not in the industry and do not know anything or anyone connected to the show. I am just making a logical analysis of the situation as I have followed it over the years.]

Watch each episode and enjoy every aspect of this incredible series. I can assure you that while newer programs might be more of everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, anyone interested in seeing the series which was the basis for a lot of these newer programs, will not be disappointed. Look past the older cell phones, cars, etc, and dive into the stories and characters... you will have fun. I know that I have enjoyed this program and now have the DVDs and have seen the many episodes many times, enjoying each one a little bit more each time, picking out nuances.

The truth is out there...",1403568000,,2619,4.623655913978495

There's plenty of predictable tropes, but the characters can stand on their own and the writing was good.  Add to that the sense of mystery that the show evokes, and you've got some quality television.  The show does suspense well.  We, just like Mulder and Skully, see just enough to know something weird is going on- but not more.  And I can't help but think that if they showed more, it would have aged worse.

This show is built on solid- if not outstanding- storytelling and characters, and that's always entertaining.",1403481600,,641,4.5701754385964914

1338153,4,B00003RQND,"First of all, let me preface this by saying I've never gotten over my major TV crush on Dana Scully, so consider this review extraordinarily biased.
Maybe it's because I turned 20 in 1990 that the show seems visually very fresh and hardly dated at all to me(land-lines and the occasional '80's shoulder-pad holdover excepted). Funnily enough, what I used to think of as Fox's a-bit-over-the-top paranoia now seems to me straight-up Kreskin-esque prescience given the exciting surveillance state we're currently enjoying. The creepy episodes remain creepy, and I still get righteously indignant when the gubmint conspires against Mulder & Scully to repress the extraterrestrial evidence in the UFO episodes.
What I'm clumsily trying to say is I am enjoying the heck out of revisiting the adventures of Scully (and Mulder), disbelief is easily suspended and I look forward to sitting down to watch as eagerly as I did 20+ years ago. The only reason I say four and not five stars is that the first half of season one I feel like they're finding their footing. Once they're really off-and-running it's five stars all the way.
One last thing: Dana Scully. I believe no less a luminary than the late, great Alex Chilton not-so-famously said, ""O Dana!"", and I would like to go on record as being in complete and total agreement.",1399507200,,1321,4.928251121076233

For those of us who have watched the entire series before, seeing the elements that were carried through the entire run of the series develop is a special joy, while those watching this season for first time will surely be drawn into the program by the strong writing and solid ensemble cast performances.",1399420800,,592,4.98989898989899

1338209,5,B00003RQND,I'm a big fan if The X-Files. When it was airing I never missed an episode and I just love extraterrestrial tv shows. This show is amazing. I wish it was still airing to this day.,1395187200,,179,4.0
1338210,5,B00003RQND,"This show had a running theme that the government can not be trusted and it was an on going battle between main character FBI Agent Fox Molder (David Duchovny) dealing with the strange disappearance of his sister when he was a young child who grows up believing she was abducted by aliens or is involved in some form government experiments. He teams up in the first episode with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to find the truth about what happened to a boy who was in a vegetable like state at a hospital and the mysterious deaths of his classmates. The twist to Dana Scully's character is she is the complete opposite of Molder. Where he looks to the supernatural and paranormal for his answers Scully solely relies on Science and factual evidence to come to her conclusions. Even if the supernatural and paranormal is staring her in the face, she often fights the urge to believe in anything that is not science based; or in anything that does not have a rational real world explanation.

I'm not going into details here and I'm not going to describe every episode in this series (lets face nine series is a lot to try and describe. There were a series of episodes that dealt with Molder (and Scully's) battle with the powerful government that tries to hide the truth from the common purpose.  Then there were ""monster's of the week"" stories that involved someone with an unusual monster like ability or some form of ghost/alien/monster like creature. I remember Season 1 Squeeze (one of my favorite shows) about a man that has to kill five people and eat their liver in order to stay alive and then hibernates for 30 something years...or the episode the Jersey Devil about a creature that comes out of the woods and eats humans to survive.

Gender Bender is another good episode where they deal with someone who can change into a male or female at will and are from an -Amish like community but of course there is more science fiction to the story that just that. I just don't want to spoil it. In Darkness Falls Molder and Scully take a trip to the woods to figure out what happened to a group of missing loggers and wind up getting attacked by swarming insects and have to fight for their lives.

One more episode that was probably my favorite in the Season 1 Roland, where they investigate the murder of members of a team of  jet propulsion scientists. They are led to the only logical suspect a mentally challenged man suffering from autism living in a group home who seemed to be have a strange gift with numbers.

I think for the first season of a show this is by far a great opening. They really introduce the characters well and give you a sense of their backgrounds without completely ramming information down your throats.",1394582400,,2741,4.583673469387755
1338211,5,B00003RQND,Nostalgia at its best. I am researching the entire show and the first seasons writing doesn't disappoint. Go watch it,1394582400,,117,4.9
1338212,4,B00003RQND,Some Eps.are just random and weird but overall the show is good worth watching if you like Cop shows or scifi its a great mix. And at times its very interesting.

Now I can see that the first few episodes were not as well done as the later episodes and seasons. Production value was a bit light weight and the acting of both actors was OK.

Mulder and Scully are synonymous with the paranormal. It is refreshing to watch a science fiction show without all the special effects  (CGI), just a good storyline and a little 'love' interest in the background, which grows throughout the many seasons.. And one of the best is the 'NO COMMERCIALS'.  I hope you enjoy this show as much as we do..",1392508800,,439,4.544303797468355

The foundation is laid for many of the later plot threads and it is done in such a way that, if you don't know already, you can't tell which are going to be ongoing and which are one-offs.  Duchovny's acting gets better as the series continues and their characters become more fleshed out.

A great series.",1391990400,,413,4.5675675675675675

1338259,5,B00003RQND,"This is by far the best SciFi series ever broadcast on television.  There were several themes running through the story line.  The opposing viewpoints of the two main  characters (Fox Mulder, Dana Scully) provided a unique look at the subject of each episode.  The writer(s) also mixed up the tone of the episodes.  Most episodes would be conspiratorial (Deep Throat, Pilot, Space), some possible in the extreme (Ghost in the Machine, ICE) some whimsical (Probability ) some others scary (Squeeze, Tooms, Humbug, Shapes).  All 202 episodes dealt with some area of the paranormal.  It covered aliens, alien abduction, ghosts, urban legends, shadow government, government conspiracies, telekinesis, clairvoyance, astrologic alignments. etc. etc. etc.  the list goes on.  The themes throughout the series can be followed by watching a subset of the episodes as advised by several online websites.  My favorites or must-sees are as follows (in the order aired); Pilot, Deep Throat, Humbug, D.P.O., Clyde Bruckman, Syzygy, Jose Chung from Outer Space, Home, Leonard Betts, Small Potatoes, Detour, The Post-Modern Prometheus, Bad Blood, All Souls, Drive, Triangle, How the Ghosts Stole Christmas, The Rain King, Monday, The Unnatural, Patience, Alone, 4D, Lord of the Flies, Improbable, Scary Monsters, Release, and Sunshine Days.  You will see many of todays current television and film stars in these episodes including Amanda Pays(Fire), Bradley Whitford(Firewalker), Terry O'Quinn(Aubrey), John Savage(Dod Kalm), Tony Shalhoub(Soft Light), Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman(Anasazi), Giovanni Ribisi & Jack Black(D.P.O.), Peter Boyle(Clyde Bruckman), R Lee Ermey(Revelations). Ryan Reynolds(Syzygy), B D Wong(Hell Money), Charles Nelson Reilly(Jose Chung from Outer Space), Amanda Tapping(Avatar), Jodie Foster(Never Again), Joe Spano(Tempus Fugit, Max), Luke Wilson(Bad Blood), Bryan Cranston(DRIVE), Michael McKean(Dreamland), Bruce Campbell(Terms of Endearment), Victoria Jackson(The Rain King), Lily Tomlin & Ed Asner(How the Ghosts Stole Christmas), Mimi Rogers(Various), Willie Garson(The Goldberg Variation), Lance Henriksen(Millennium), Garry Shandling & Tea Leoni(Hollywood A.D.), Cary Elwes(Various), Lucy Lawless(Nothing Happened...II), Aaron Paul(Lord of the Flies), Burt Reynolds(Improbable), Michael Emerson(Sunshine Days), and many others you would recognize.

1338262,4,B00003RQND,"The X-Files are very well done and I shall continue to watch later seasons. They are very well produced and keep your interest. I do have a couple of bones to pick with the production. It is taking Dana Scully a very long time to at least make a small buy-in to the mysterious, alien, things we don't understand incidents they investigate. I am pretty skeptical myself, but if I had been investigating the actual cases they had, I would cut Fox Mulder a little more slack and think, ""Well, maybe there is something to this.""

My second bone to pick is that the stories never have a conclusion. Generally, speaking they leave you wanting for some type of closure. They are well produced, but nearly all episodes left me hanging.

By the way, the FBI tried to fire Mulder once, only to be stopped by someone from the senate or very high up in the food chain. Considering what he's like, it seems like a stuffy organization like the FBI would have weeded him out much earlier, or posted him somewhere except Washington at Headquarters.",1391558400,,1032,4.543010752688172

I am a scientist, so the X-files material is strictly pseudo-science most of the time. For example, alien abductees always wind up in their beds. Conclusion:  they were dreaming. Sometimes they come closer to reality, like the Jersey Devil. Bigfoot exists, I saw one once. However, scientifically, that should not be proof for you.

But after I purchased it it wouldn't play (hence the 3 stars instead of 5). I tried everything I could think of, even called my son-in-law into the room who know more computer and  internet tech that me (still no go). It wouldn't download fully--I got sound but no picture.
So I went to Netflix and watched it for free! I did have the same initial problem getting to play, but I went through Google to Netflix and got it to play right.
Now, in all fairness, the next day, I retried Amazon from my Video Library, and it did download and start with no problem (hence 3 stars as opposed to 1).
I will add that it is rare that I have a problem buying a video and playing it from Amazon. I think it has happened only once before. But this time it was quite frustrating.",1390953600,,957,4.145161290322581

1338307,5,B00003RQND,"Re-watching the X-Files' first season in 2014, I was struck by how innocent Mulder, Scully and much of the FBI appear. They're constantly being pushed around by the big guys--the military, the NSA. I have trouble imagining a program today portraying its leads in such a prone manner.

But that innocence is part of the program's charm and lends to the shared sense of wonder we get watching it. Whereas old Twilight Zone episodes would often talk down to their audience, the X-Files characters all seem as surprised by what they're discovering as their audience is.

For an audience surviving 20 years of fashion, Scully's professional wear dates the show heavily. Thankfully they never spend time with Gecko-bricks pressed to their ears. Gratefully, the iPhone wasn't around to keep both their necks perpetually tilted toward the ground.

Their operating systems may look archaic but the stories were more about the people using the command-lines than the command-lines themselves. And that will always make for better science fiction.

This season has some stand-out episodes. ""Squeeze"" and ""Tooms"" are both here along with tribute to The Thing, ""Ice"".

It's taken some recalibration for me to remember that X-Files wasn't always drinking-game-worthy, full of in-jokes and self-created camp. For the best of it, start right at the beginning.",1389139200,,1343,5.227906976744186

I missed David Duchovny (Mulder) at the end of the episodes in the series.  The best on television for all time!  Such great writing!

We will always be afraid of the monsters and aliens and it's nice to know that there are people out there that are as inquisitive as I am and are willing to stand with us to prevail over the unknown dangers out there.,1388620800,,436,4.395061728395062

1338317,5,B00003RQND,If you know your television you would realize that The X-Files was the first show since The Twilight Zone to truly put itself out there. No disrespect meant to Dr. Who of course but really the mood created by this show was unlike any other and was the cornerstone for a whole bunch of movies and tv shows since. I like bedrock type stuff and The X-Files is stone cold bedrock!!,1388188800,,377,4.323943661971831
1338318,4,B00003RQND,"I have seen later episodes where the show is a lot better.  I have to remind myself that this is the first season where they are finding their feet as actors.  I also know that while a good show in it's own right, just as a show.....it wasw pretty revolutionary for it's time.  Stranger content and better effects than had been seen much previously on TV.
If you like small running arcs and creature of the week shows you will like this.  It doesn't over commit you with a huge must keep up plot which todays shows are almost exclusively doing.  Spooky fox is spooky fun.",1388102400,,571,4.349056603773585

1338321,5,B00003RQND,So much better than the current 'remakes' and reality trash.  Miss the decent writing and non-apologetic scripts.  Highly recommend this series to everyone.,1387497600,,156,5.739130434782608

1338324,5,B00003RQND,"Love the series, hate the way Amazon Prime does not always allow viewing.  Perhaps there are too many of us trying to use the system at the same time, and their servers are not able to handle the load.  Not sure, but a third of the time, the system does not work!  Hey Amazon, FIX IT!!!!!!",1387238400,,289,4.125

1338330,5,B00003RQND,"Developing of the characters and plot themes during the first season is done well. Easy to see the budget isn't as robust as later seasons, but still effective. My children have started to watch with my wife and I and they are engaged, even though they are used to better special effects and computer generated animations, which lets me know the series is still effective entertainment. Recommended!!!",1386028800,,401,5.0
1338331,5,B00003RQND,"From time to time one has to take a step back.  Upon taking a step back you re-watch something that gave you pleasure.  X-Files is that step back.  It takes you back to a time where reality TV programing didn't singe your brain cells with stupid antics and people that feel they are entitled.  I still believe that there are people out there that miss good programming.  So if your over 35, and haven't let social media make you feel it's all about you.  Watch X-Files again and go to your happy place, but don't tweet about it or post it on Facebook.",1385683200,,551,4.300970873786408

1338334,5,B00003RQND,"Outstanding plot, tremendous intrigue and difficulty predicting what is going to happen next, just like a roller coaster ride, exciting! Acting is wonderful and the relationship between the two protagonists couldn't be better, very compatible.  I'll enjoy continuing to watch all the episodes in Season 1, not quite finished yet, in no rush....it's that good!",1384819200,,359,5.527272727272727
1338335,5,B00003RQND,"Episodes are not HD and only 4:3 aspect ratio, but they all have an intriguing story. After seeing the last two or three movies, we decided to watch these episodes in Amazon Prime streaming. Nice quality and subtitled.",1384646400,,218,4.7631578947368425
1338336,5,B00003RQND,"If you are choosing to watch The X-files you definitely want to start with the first season. This sets you up
for everything else that follows with regard to the re-occurring alien plot and all of its interesting characters.

The show's producer, Chris Carter, credits 'The Twilight Zone' as the reason for The X-Files even being able
to get to television. Certainly the special effects are much better but the stories echo it's predecessor and
then pushes the envelope further. There is no doubt that The X-Files stands tall upon the shoulders of 'The
Twilight Zone'.

There is the main plot thread of alien abduction and alleged government complicity but knowing this would
wear thin the writers would introduce other creepy, odd, supernatural, and sometime humorous episodes.
Occasionally those episodes have an ending...and sometimes they do not. Some of the episodes are left
open to conjecture.

One piece the producer did use with good effect, I think, was the voice over. This was pulled  from 'The
Twilight Zone' and used to introduce the episode, and at the end, ask more questions or to comment on the
human condition. Or both. Sometimes it was used like Deus Ex Machina to create closure on a particular
episode.

When this series was originally aired I chanced upon it and was immediately smitten with it's dark tone and
near paranoiac approach. The Dana Scully character helps keep the plots grounded since she is a physician
and supposed to be there to balance the protagonist, Fox Mulder, in his quest for the truth. This helps with
the creative tension needed to keep propelling the alien abduction plot thread as well as the other unusual
and eerie episodes. Of course the two start out in the first episode with different views on their reason
for Scully's partnering with Mulder.

The sound track is done in Dolby Digital and the series done in Full Frame (1.33:1). The Dolby soundtrack has
5.1 channels of discrete audio and the Surround contains up to 4 channels of encoded audio. You are also
able to playback from your 2-channel DVD outputs as this season is compatible with the stereo and Dolby Pro
Logic reproduction as well. If you can envelop yourself in the soundtrack with surround things will get
spookier.

If you are interested, the Special Features have deleted scenes from ""Pilot"" and some special effects clips
from ""Fallen Angel"" episodes.

Do yourself a favor and pick this season up, or stream it using Amazon Prime. I gave it Five Stars for it's
creative writing, direction, art direction, and creepy quotient. Have fun and remember The Truth Is Out
There...somewhere...in the future.",1384473600,5,2624,4.934240362811791
1338337,3,B00003RQND,"Of course David Duchovny is in the running for the worlds worst actor, but the series has a campy kind of charm. Like an old ""B"" movie. It was the original of it's kind spawning shows like Lost and Fringe. Shows were nothing is answered, yet we watch week after week expecting something different.

1338399,5,B00003RQND,"I was a young teen when this show came out. I remember how much the characters resonated with me. As a young girl, I looked up to Scully, who was one of the few strong female characters on TV. The chemistry between Moulder and Scully was undeniable. I highly recommend this show.",1378166400,,279,4.384615384615385
1338400,5,B00003RQND,First year I was a little skeptical of this show even though my husband raved about it. I grew to love it just like him.,1377993600,,120,3.84
1338401,5,B00003RQND,Really enjoyed these. if you are into any kind of sy-fy you will like this even if it is kinda old.,1377820800,,99,3.761904761904762

1338403,5,B00003RQND,"My husband and I were faithful X-Files watchers from the get-go. The first season contains some of the best episodes and creepy characters, plus it cements the relationship between Mulder and Skully. I especially adored Dana Skully as she was the epitome of the young working, intelligent woman who wasn't a sit-com character! While the plots are still great after all these years, it is somewhat disconcerting to see the long coats and severe mannish pantsuits Skully wears! And the cell phones were huge! Styles aside, watching ""Spooky"" Mulder and Dana Skully is a treat that doesn't get old. Even though Area 51 has been declassified as a secret U-2 testing site, we hope Mulder would still feel ""the truth is out there"" and that he and Skully would still  ""want to believe."" Have fun and enjoy the X-Files!",1377820800,,810,4.827338129496403
1338404,5,B00003RQND,"I never saw this series when it came out so I am catching up. Boy, were their cell phones clunky!",1377734400,,97,3.9
1338405,4,B00003RQND,This was a good series.  I enjoyed watching with my wife.  As a sci-fi thriller I would watch more of the same kind of show and reccomend others to do the same.,1377734400,,160,3.96875
1338406,4,B00003RQND,Still worth watching even after watching much later seasons.  Would definitely recommend watching this season if you are a science fiction fan.,1377561600,,143,5.5
1338417,5,B00003RQND,"I was in middle school when this show start/was on air and I did like it but obviously was way to young to fully appreciate it.  I used to to tune in on some LONG marathons when they were on, and the Sci-fi channel used to show the later seasons at  like 2AM on weekdays.  That being said, I actually had never seen season one, but always liked the X-Files.  I gotta say I am SO happy I revisited these.  The show, while having classic (nostalgic) 90's special effects/clothing doesn't feel ""old"", it has aged well in my opinion.  The story line is excellent and while generally most of the episodes in this season are independent ""cases"" the over-arching theme and plot tends to move you along effectively.  I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate Sci-fi, detective shows, etc.

Ps. also Dave D and Gillian Anderson so young.. its great",1377475200,,843,4.5364238410596025

1338422,5,B00003RQND,"I watched most episodes when it first aired. I started watching the first season again and I do enjoy it. Today's movies are mostly visual effects.

1338437,5,B00003RQND,X-files first season is great I enjoyed it as a kid and still enjoy it.  David Duchovny and Gillian Andersen are fantastic,1375056000,,122,4.545454545454546

1338446,5,B00003RQND,"Besides the inappropriate sexual episode, this is a great work in media and a cool early 1990's era version of U.S. Government Conspiracies and Unexplainable Events with mysterious unsolved cases many of which were derived from real life accounts and supernatural occurances. The first season in television shows are usually more genuine and pure to the original ideas the creators were going for and the x-files is no exception, these are great episodes with more true intentions compared to the later versions once writers run out of story lines, actors get tired and the general public just latches onto something that has become the in thing or commercially fashionable on a mainstream level. If you're interested in The X-Files, start here where it all began at the beginning, 5 stars!",1373932800,,790,5.084615384615384
1338447,4,B00003RQND,I can see how this show was influenced by Twin Peaks. I'm hoping Season 2 gets much better. Mulder is an incredible character.  I see where Fringe now originated from.  I find Scully not believing to be an annoying schtick at times.,1373932800,,232,4.5
1338448,5,B00003RQND,"I was a huge fan of this show when it originally aired and never missed an episode if I could help it.

1338455,5,B00003RQND,"Every season of the the X-Files is amazing. I recommend watching every episode in order from Season 1 and you will find amazing character development, attachment to the characters, suspense, drama, and horror like no other tv show. They simply don't make shows this great anymore. Every season Mulder goes deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of uncovering the truth. Anyone into government conspiracies and Aliens, will love this show. It has aged very well and is better than most all TV shows today. If you have not seen the X-Files yet or you have not seen these for years(this show is better the 2nd time around) pick all of these up on DVD, starting with Season 1. The product comes with multiple discs all packaged nicely in one secure case and this time there are NO COMMERCIALS! This show is addictive, get it today!",1373068800,,827,4.671232876712328

Mulder remains committed to his cause, skeptical of his new partner, but willing to share with her his motivation.",1372204800,,478,5.063291139240507

The only thing that dates it is the answering machines and missing cell phones, but I love that!  I love the nostalgia!  Every episode has me hanging off the edge of my seat.

The things that drew me to the show were first off, watching the relationship between Mulder and Scully develop, the mystery behind the stories which were mostly unpredictable, I love unpredictability when it comes to any story line, that ""I didn't see that one coming"", conspiracy theories, and lastly the entire line up of characters, some you love and others you loved to hate.  Over all I loved the series more with each passing season and was saddened when it had to come to an end.",1370908800,,597,4.418181818181818

1338475,5,B00003RQND,"Being house confined for a few weeks due to illness I started watching the series all over again and got just as hooked as the first time around.  The pilot does a superb job of introducing us to the main characters, to Mulder's passion and to Scully's initial dispassionate and sceptic based role.  Duchovney and Anderson establish their presence and as the series progresses, they inhabit their roles.  The first season has a great mix of the alien, government conspiracy and individual ""monster/mutant"" espisodes, so you never get overly saturated with any one plot line.  I am looking forward to watching the rest of the seasons as I gorge myself on some great, engaging and entertaining TV.",1370649600,,695,4.914529914529915

The characters are still developing, finding their footing, and have yet to create the dramatic sexual tension that became the hallmark of Mulder and Scully.  While this is a must see for fans of the cult show, it might be a harder sell to the friends and significant others of hard-core fanboy nerds like myself.  For that, you might want to hook them in with a few episodes from season 3-5 and then take the completionist angle to rope them in to watching the whole shebang.

The scenes show the smaller budget that they had to get going. In one show, the scene takes place in Iowa, there are mountains in the background, No mountains in Iowa that i know of.

Here I am 29 and I still LOVE this show, the characters are brilliant Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) are a great pairing, they are one of the few male-female professional couplings that you can enjoy not because you are waiting for them to Hook up.

The Story lines are fantastic, I love every episode! It offers a taste of everything you may have ever questioned, Just...It's so good!
I Look forward to watching with my own kids too, because it ages well.

The season really is worth watching, but be prepared to Love it and then have to watch the entire series -

The cast was perfect right down to ""Cigarette Smoking Man"".  And the relationship between Mulder & Scully was as realistic as any male-female team I've ever seen.

If you haven't watched the show for a while, I would urge you to give it a go.  Best to start with Season 1 Episode 1 and go thru in order.  You won't be disappointed.",1368403200,,502,4.297872340425532

Being able to watch the show again, in order, has helped me to appreciate just how well-written the series is.  The relationship between Mulder and Scully and the tension between them is SO well-done.  The first season does such a great job raising intriguing questions and having just the right mix of answering some of those questions and leaving some of those questions unanswered.  Really good job, too, introducing many of the supporting characters around mulder and scully.  All in all, this is a great price for the dvd set (or free streaming w prime).

1338508,5,B00003RQND,"Back in the 90s, I didn't just watch cartoons.  I also enjoyed watching some of the adult shows with my elders, such as the Star Trek shows on at the time (Next Generation, Deep Space 9 & Voyager) & of course this classic.  For a while, every week I'd go over to my aunt's house next door & watch the latest X-Files with her.  I have no idea why I wanted to see it; I guess it was my love of sci-fi & UFOs & stuff, but I asked to see it with someone, & she was the only one who liked it.  So I sat down with her one night for an episode in season 3, & was hooked.  I stopped watching somewhere in season 5; I think that's when I started getting obsessed with Pokemon (I am deeply ashamed I ever liked that garbage) so I just stopped watching & forgot about it.  Recently I bought this set for $10.79, & it was very well spent.

1. Pilot:  A young FBI agent is assigned watchdog duty over a fellow agent, but finds herself drawn into his investigations of paranormal & unexplained phenomena.  An above average episode that really drew me back into the series.  A-

2.  Deep Throat:  A test pilot who may have been flying aircraft with alien technology disappears, & Mulder & Scully must defy their own government to find the truth.  This is my least favorite of the myth arc episodes here, but it's still a good first episode for Deep Throat, Mulder's mysterious informant.  B

3.  Squeeze:  Mulder & Scully search for a humanoid killer whose savage murder spree reoccurs every 30 years.  An incredible episode, featuring one of their most memorable villains.  A+

4.  Conduit:  Mulder becomes obsessed with solving a case that closely parallels an ""encounter e experienced as a child.  Now this is what I expected from the myth arc episodes.  A+

5.  The Jersey Devil:  Mulder & Scully track a legendary creature that has roamed the New Jersey countryside for over 40 years.  Not what I expected, but not bad.  B+

6. Shadows:  Mulder & Scully investigate the deaths of two men believed to have been killed by a psychokinetic force.  A very blah episode.  C

7.  Ghost in the Machine:  On Halloween, Mulder & Scully investigate the death of a corporate executive who may have been murdered by a thinking computer.  The computer reminds me too much of HAL, but that's the only flaw in this episode, albeit a fairly big one.  I still liked it.  B

8.  Ice:  Mulder & Scully are sent to investigate when a team of geophysicists, stationed at a remote Alaskan outpost, is killed by a parasitic alien life form.  Despite re-using the plot from the Thing, this is still a good episode.  B+

9. Space:  When a space shuttle mission is sabotaged, Mulder suspects it may be the work of an evil extraterrestrial spirit that inhabits the body of a former Gemini astronaut.  The worst episode of the series so far.  D+

10.  Fallen Angel:  The Future of the X-Files project is jeopardized after Mulder secretly infiltrates the government cover-up of a UFO crash.  I love most of the myth arc episodes, & this is no exception.  A+

11. Eve:  Mulder & Scully search for 2 girls who disappeared after their fathers were murdered in an identical fashion.  This is really good.  Creepy, too.  A

12.  Fire:  Mulder & Scully join forces with an inspector from Scotland Yard when a man with pyrokinetic powers stalks members of the British aristocracy.  A couple logic breaks here & there, but still a good episode, thanks to a fine villain & Mulder's old flame.  B+

13.  Beyond the Sea:  Scully believes that the psychic predictions of a death row inmate are the only hope in apprehending a murder victim.  Personally, I think this fan favorite is a bit overrated.  It's still great, just not one I would put in my top 10 standalone episodes.  A

14.  Gender Bender:  A religious sect member capable of changing gender becomes the prime suspect in a murder spree.  I thought this was a great, mysterious episode.  A

15. Lazarus:  The consciousness of a dangerous criminal possesses an FBI agent who is also Scully's ex-boyfriend.  Reminded me too much of body swap episodes in cartoons.  C

16.  Young at Heart:  A criminal believed to have died in prison years earlier wages a vendetta against Mulder.  Personally, I loved this episode.  The atmosphere, the villain, the story; I thought it was really gripping.  A+

17. E.B.E.: Mulder & Scully become the focus of a misinformation campaign when they attempt to trace the government's secret transport of an alien life form.  Another great myth arc episode.  A

18. Miracle Man: The agents investigate a ministry led by a man whose son possesses the power to heal & to kill with a touch of his hand.  I enjoyed this.  A

19. Shapes:  The agents track a wolf-like creature linked to a Native American legend.  The twist is too easy to see coming.  C

20. Darkness Falls:  A group of loggers working in a remote forest unearth thousands of deadly insect-like creatures that paralyze then cocoon their victims.  Rightfully considered one of the best non-myth arc episodes.  A+

21. Tooms:  Eugene Tooms, who Mulder helped incarcerate, is released on parole.  A great sequel to my favorite episode of the season.  A+

22. Born Again:  An eight-year old girl is the prime suspect in a series of bizarre, seemingly unrelated deaths.  Felt a little redundant compared to Eve, but still an above average episode.  A-

23. Roland:  When top scientists at an aeronautics research lab die under mysterious circumstances, the agents suspect a mentally challenged-janitor may somehow be the culprit.  A

24.  The Erlenmeyer Flask:  Deep Throat tips Mulder to a critically important case involving a missing fugitive and the cloning of extraterrestrial viruses.  An excellent finale.  A+

1338546,5,B00003RQND,"This is where the X-Files all began.

Agent Mulder leads the one-man X-Files division of the FBI - the division the investigates the unexplained, the weird, and the just-plain-crazy. Believed to be doing pointless work and wasting the FBI's time and resources, Mulder is assigned a partner: Agent Scully. Scully is a scientific skeptic and is expected to debunk Mulder's X-Files. However, with Mulder's passion for the unusual and Scully's attention to detail and desire to focus on the facts, they begin to be wildly successful in resolving these strange cases.

From extraterrestrials to folk-tales to government conspiracies to mythology, Mulder and Scully cover it all, so there's a little something for everyone to enjoy. Made in the heyday of television series, the X-Files has delightfully long seasons (24 episodes in this season, each ~45 minutes long) and plot-driven episodes, where you get to know and love the characters naturally, as opposed to today's series which are short and focus far too much on the personal lives of the characters.

Though maybe half of the episodes have conclusive endings, the true drive of this series is the abundance conspiratorial cliff-hangers. Who (if anybody) can Mulder and Scully trust? Why are other branches of the government hiding their goings-on from even the FBI and who exactly is involved? Some episodes you'll wonder if you should side with Mulder's supernatural view of events or if Scully was right all along.

The X-Files is essential viewing for any sci-fi enthusiast and suggested viewing for just about everyone else. Though there are occasionally cheesy special effects by modern standards, the series overall has aged very well and is still extremely enjoyable, even more so than many modern sci-fi series.",1362614400,,1773,5.2105263157894735
1338547,4,B00003RQND,"The episodes that revolve around the alien presence and government involvement and cover up are spooky and interesting and provide a great backdrop for the relationship between Scully and Mulder.

1338550,3,B00003RQND,"*UPDATE* 6/23/15...I watched more X-Files the other night through my new Amazon Fire Stick, and the Audio is EXCELLENT now. I have no idea what the problem was before,  but now it's a 5-star rating from me. Now...it's X-Files marathon time! The truth is out there...

20 years later and I'm still in love with the X-Files! Duchovny and Anderson are (arguably) the best duo from any TV series in history thus far. Mulder and Scully have become iconic characters that even non-fans recognize by name alone. Season One is excellent, and still a treat to watch as the show and character development begins. I have been watching it on my smart TV through Amazon's Video on Demand, and although I cannot say enough about how much I still love X-Files, the audio is really disappointing and detracts significantly from the whole experience! Even hooking up my old VCR (!) and watching recorded episodes straight from TV so long ago yields better audio quality than I'm getting from amazon's video on demand as of this date, 030313, so I know it's not just the age of the series' audio. It's got this tin-can sound about like the audio quality you'd get from trying to watch TV through Skype or something. X-Files has always been suspenseful, but the sound quality here really doesn't do the show justice.  Easily a 5 (or 10) star show if the audio was better.",1362355200,2,1352,4.6722689075630255

Mulder is the believer in paranormal phenomenon and Scully is the skeptic. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson did a really good job at portraying these characters. I don't think anyone could have done it better than them. I going to rate each episode based on my opinion.
The Pilot: I thought this was a good start to the series, seeing Mulder and Scully  meet for the first time, it was interesting. I give this episode a 8/10.
Deep Thoat: I liked this episode too. 8/10
Squeeze: Great episode. 9/10
Conduit: This episode was decent. 6/10
The Jersey Devil: Another decent episode. 6/10
Shadows: I give this episode a 7/10. It would've gotten an 8 it's just that the woman in this episode reminds me a little too much of that pathetic miserable damsel Bella Swan from the Twilight movies.
Ghost In The Machine: Some people didn't like this episode. I, however did like it. 8/10
Ice: One of the best episodes of the first season. This episode was based off of John Carpenter's The Thing. One of my all time favorite science fiction movies. This episode gets a 10/10. Outstanding.
Space: This episode didn't really stand out to me. 4/10
Fallen Angel: Good episode. 7/10
Eve: Pretty good. 7/10
Fire: This episode introduces a guy with pyrokinesis. Awesome ability. I give this episode an 8/10
Beyond The Sea: The actor who voices Chucky the killer doll is in this episode. But it's a decent episode. 6/10
Gender Bender: I'd say this episode is average. 5/10
Lazarus: This was interesting. 7/10
Young At Heart: I like this episode. 8/10
E.B.E: Good episode. 8/10
Miracle Man: I thought this was decent. 6/10
Shapes: This episode gets a 7/10. I would have given this episode a 6 but because it has werewolves in it. It gets a bonus.
Darkness Falls: Outstanding episode. This episode ranks right up there with Ice in my opinion. 10/10
Tooms: This episode is a sequel to Squeeze and it is just as good. 9/10
Born Again: Good episode. 7/10
Roland: This was pretty good. 7/10
The Erlenmeyer Flask: This episode was a great ending to the first season. I give it a 9/10.
Overall, The X Files season one is awesome. I rate it 5 stars. I will be watching this many more times. If you're a fan of paranormal phenomenon and UFOs then this is certainly worth buying.",1351900800,,2416,4.631701631701632

1338587,3,B00003RQND,"The granddaddy of them all, the progenitor of all manner of contemporary sci fi offspring- Fringe, Grimm, Once Upon a Time, I suppose they're actually all part of a genre that has merely had different writers through the millenia. X-Files, though, brought America in to a new generation of appreciation for the unexplained, the mysterious, the unknown, which has always been a part of the human experience. That being said, this one's a clunker. In ten years, the rough amount of time that has passed since the show's inception, the capacity of writers to deftly cram as much fast quick moving plotline as possible has made Hollywood writers the envy of the world. I could see very little of that in this episode. The mechanics are there, invisible things in the sky, robotic people, nefarious conspiracies. All pretty new in the first years of the twenty first century. Now, though,  this episode feels as if it honks along on expository dialogue that drags its butt on the ground, obvious acting and invocation of tropes that practically show a written invitation ""to believe."" Still, it cut the ice for many shows of its kind. And for that, well, I guess I have to believe.",1349654400,,1176,4.793103448275862

Scully sees the huge flaw about Mulder and instead of constantly chastising him about it, she only contrasts his ""blinding"" belief with her defensive logic.

1338591,4,B00003RQND,"Tell me if you'd heard this one: You go to the bar; Try to hit on the hot ladies, but no go. Then some OK looking woman makes advances to you, but you aren't that interested since you only want the super hot chicks. She somehow persuades you, and you go back to her place. It's the best boink you've ever had, and look up only to find...wait for it...wait: the chick's a dude! (Then you die from a heart-attack)...

I've had some of those awkward mornings.

[SPOILDERS]: OK, seriously. This episode was kind of hard to follow. We get that the killer can change from a man to woman and back again. What I don't understand is how everyone in that small sect has the pheromone emitting powers to allure the opposite gender. Why would they have these powers in the first place. What purpose does it serve if they keep to themselves and only that small group (instead of taking over the world with illicit propositions) and when do they feel they need to change genders (maybe it's easier to use the bathroom as a standing guy instead of a squatting girl?). There's a lot details that really don't make sense. Luckily, that doesn't cripple this episode from being entertaining.

BEST QUOTE - Mulder: ""I know what I saw, Scully, and I was about to see you do the wild thing with some stranger""...",1347494400,,1290,4.4576271186440675
1338592,5,B00003RQND,"Which is good (although at times a bit over the top, like usual). This could be a really good episode, or a really bad episode. If you ask the person who wants action and less talking (and thinking), it's slow and pretty boring.

[SPOILERS]: However, this epi not only forces you to wonder if Dobbs really has the powers he claims, and if he's really working with the other murderer. A bonus is that we get to see roles switched for Mulder and Scully. Mulder wears and dress and Scully wears a wife-beater (tank-top). OK, not that switcheroo. Mulder this time doesn't believe Bogg's has an ""ability"" and Scully is torn between wanting to be skeptical like usual, or ""believe"" (like Mulder). This is the first time we truly see Scully angry (and quite the threatening beast too!).

OFF-TOPIC: There is an element that might change your opinion of Dobbs. While at first, he's portrayed as any random maniacal murderer. After he admits to murdering his whole family and others, we also see how he's haunted by seeing them ""each time"" (he gets re-incarnated, each life he's been a murderer) he's sent to the chair. This time around, he doesn't want to go to the ""chair"" since he has to see each murdered spirit glaring him down the walk (hence the ""deal""). OK, sure, so he shows some shred of remorse. Big deal, right?

That's not the part that fascinates me. Besides him saving Scully from death, he was willing to tell the last message of Scully's father to her if she would appear/witness his ""last words"". As he's strapped to the chair, he searches for her, but alas, she didn't show. The look of disappointment on his face because, maybe, he was wanting to use his ""ability"" for her without any demands (this time) as a means of some form of redemption (maybe in the next life?). With her not showing, his ""good deed"" won't be acknowledged. I felt sorry for Dobbs because he was denied that redemption.",1347494400,,1903,4.607669616519174
1338602,4,B00003RQND,"*enter Prodigy's Fire Starter song here*

This episode is fairly good. Not great, but we get someone more interesting than the antagonist. What's more interesting than a guy who can start a flame with his finger? Well, an woman who will rekindle an old flame with HER finger! While the story for ""Flame-boy"" is fun, we're too busy wondering how the ""new"" girl is going to fair off with Mulder after so many years...and seeing all the annoyed reactions of Scully dealing with the two ""lovers"". That alone is worth watching the episode (even though the ""human torch"" is still worth watching, too). Also, for the first time, Mulder actually orders Scully to NOT be active in a case (in this case, it's a sign of concern/protection for her).",1347494400,,737,4.713178294573644
1338603,5,B00003RQND,"Some episodes are slow and drawn out. This one has so much going in it that you forget that it's 46 mins long. You're too busy trying to figure out what is really going on and who is involved. Some episodes rely on one small twist (usually at the end) to put it all together. This episode has many twists and false leads that throw you off. Not much for character development or action scenes, but one of the few times Mulder is actually wrong on his theory. It's strictly just a well written script that keeps you guessing.",1347235200,,524,4.303030303030303
1338604,4,B00003RQND,"More cover-ups that Mulder comes across. We see yet again that Mulder is very sharp about details that point to obvious lies from the government. This episode, Mulder's character development exposes how persistent he is to finding evidence and answers (even to the point of his job threatened to be cut). Call it dedication or an obsession, he doesn't know when to quit. Scully doesn't take up as much screen time as she usually does, and instead is only there because she needs to drag him back to reality.

The end has an interesting twist that foreshadows a much bigger agent/organization. Overall, a decent episode since we see the glaring flaw Mulder plagued with.

OFF-Topic: When Mulder drops his camera, the shutter keeps going going. Any photographer would know that that wouldn't happen since the camera has to have a finger pushing the shutter button. Also, I guess this was an excuse to pull out the 10mm super-wide angle lens for the ""fallen angel"" viewpoint/perspective.",1347235200,,984,4.957575757575758
1338605,2,B00003RQND,"Excuse my awful pun for a title. This episode is hard to follow. Spoilers ahead, so be sure to watch the episode before you read my comment.

Apparently a shuttle launch is getting sabotaged and it's up to The Two to figure it out. This episode not only lacks in a good story/script, it also lacks in props and footage. They use a lot of launchpad shuttle ""footage"" and supposed ""mission control"" room and outer-space scenes, but lack views from the inside of the cockpit (besides never even seeing the men that were in ""danger""). All we get is an idea that while one astronaut was in space, he got ""possessed"" by something (ghost/apparition/alien form) and it can cut through some metal that would require a tremendous amount of heat, time and manpower to pull off to sabotage the shuttle. We are told this. There is no scene where the supposed ghost tampers with the shuttle. Everything in this episode is everyone verbally explaining every action to you (because they couldn't spend money to actually get real props and CG effects).

In the end, the Commander throws himself out of a window (again, you don't see it, just a mess of shaky camera and blurred vision to give the illusion he jumped out of a tall building) to kill the ""ghost"" along with him. Which brings up the question, if the darn thing can live in space (without air), why would it need a human ""host"" to live. Why couldn't it just possess some idiot standing on the sidewalk right before the Commander flattens out on the pavement?

Maybe I'm thinking too much into it. It's a very poor episode, both visually and plot-wise. If this was the first or second episode for the first season, this show would have definitely been canceled.",1347235200,,1704,4.617161716171617
1338606,5,B00003RQND,"Yeah, if anyone has seen original ""The Thing"", this episode harkens a lot from it. I wouldn't call it a blatant rip-off (honestly, what movies and shows are fresh ideas?). We get to see The Two work with other people in different fields (a geologist and toxicologist)for the first time. Again, they don't seem to agree on how things are done. The redeeming factor in this episode is the schism you witness between Scully and Mulder. While they don't always see eye-to-eye, they vehemently despise each other in this episode. There's also a nice plot twist that I didn't see (spoiler: They resolve their disputes with a healthy game of Mario Party). I really enjoyed this episode. Apparently not everyone will like it, it seems.

OFF-TOPIC: Yay, the dog lives! Also, the ""parasite"" they use for a prop is just a maelworm (the same you use for fishing or feeding to pet lizards).",1347148800,,877,4.73202614379085
1338607,3,B00003RQND,"Maybe he felt neglected because no one played Solitaire enough with him when he was only 8-bits old. Or it could be that his parents (like interfaith marriages that don't work: an unholy uniting of different OS's - an Amiga dad with an Apple II mother) expected too much out of him to be the chess champion like his brother ""Big Blue"". Realizing he could never aspire to be what he was created for, he fell on heavy drugs like speed (faster volatile RAM in this case), getting juiced all the time (probably switched from 120v/12A to 240v/15A for more power), and went to drinking his milliseconds away (getting drunk on liquid cooling).

Then he killed a man for the first time. They say you never forget your first kill. He's too far gone, now. He's an outlaw. Refusing to conform to society and driven by rebellion (do doubt waving the Linux OS flag, now) he acts on his own volition.

OK, I might have filled in my own blanks for the plot, but the show delves into another subject matter that seems cliche now (a self-aware computer). It's still an entertaining episode. If you're looking for aliens or supernatural stuff, you might get bored, though.

1338608,4,B00003RQND,"This time we get to deal with a lady (a cute one at that!) who might have psychic powers. Not much character development, although we do see Scully drawing her own conclusions for once and she does offer consoling and advice for the person involved, even if Scully doesn't believe in all the supernatural elements Mulder throws at her.

OFF-TOPIC: I wonder if Mulder has a thing against black people. The one agent he says: ""I say you people already suffer from full denial..."" (oh snap!), and the other car that gets hit, was a black man. I'm just kidding, but it's funny to take note. Also, favorite quote goes to Mulder: ""Only one person has pulled off a fake death....Elvis"". Seeing Scully's dismissive face after that answer is classic.",1347148800,,741,4.7
1338609,4,B00003RQND,"Scully is being the skeptic again and doesn't want to believe in typical regional folklore myths (sasquatches, chupacabras, gamer girls that aren't psycho, etc.). This episode, we get to see Scully try to go on a date. I think it's a bit early for this entry in character development, but they probably paced it in case the show got cancelled. Clearly we see that even as skeptical Scully is, she always rides along to see Mulder through (and so do we since he is a whack-job on his own). Just another display of the disparity between the two protagonists and their polarized ideas, and more local authority that refuses to let them try to even look at the cases (why paint everyone as a dictating power-hungry cop?).

OFF-TOPIC: I always find it funny watching Scully romp around in her nice business outfits and psuedo-heels in muddy woods and trash littered backstreets. Also, what would a bunch of kids at a birthday party know about ""Guerrilla warfare""?",1347148800,,958,4.771084337349397
1338610,3,B00003RQND,"What keeps this show going for me is how snarky and sarcastic Mulder is even when faced with some of the most ruthless agents mucking up their investigations. If it weren't for Scully constantly making sure Mulder doesn't overstep people's privacy and space, he might be out of line a few times. This episode is pretty slow, and it doesn't even have a closer (end). It's not a cliff-hanger, but the main question (can you wear stilettos while jumping on a water bed?) isn't ever answered. The credits just roll.

OFF-TOPIC: The family has a Marantz receiver under the TV (I recognize that horizontal fly-wheel dial for the radio anywhere). Now I'm thinking of how I can add ""attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or release of glucocorticoids"" in everyday conversations. I'm sure I can bring it up at our next poker game on Thursdays...",1347062400,,847,4.841379310344828
1338611,5,B00003RQND,"Like I stated in the previous reviews, not a huge fan about ET/UFO's. Just like if you don't like Fantasy books, why would you watch Fantasy movies/shows? This episode is a god-send since it really shows what this series is (and will be) capable of.

We now deal with a person that [obviously] isn't real or could be real (won't spoil it, but he can do something that ""normal"" human beings can't). But why should we even care about a story that suspends all reality? Again, it's how the two figure out this who and how this ""person"" was able to kill so many people. It's not realistic by any means, but you could have moldy old cheese in your fridge that became self-aware and started molesting your begonias, ferns, rose bush, and other random plants in your backyard, and Scully/Molder would figure out the puzzle and lock it up in a Zip-Lock bag and call it a day.

Realistic? Hardly. But it sure is fun watching the two being harassed and chastised by the other arrogant branches of FBI, only for them to prevail at the end. It's their drive that will keep you coming back for more since everyone else seems inept. However, they both have flaws, so you don't feel like they are ever too smart or impervious to making mistakes.

It's nice to know this show won't all be about UFO lore, but also delves in supernatural and ""monster"" lore too.",1347062400,,1344,4.477551020408163
1338612,3,B00003RQND,"You might want to read my ""Pilot"" episode review so you have an idea where my opinions are coming from.

This episode was pretty weak IMHO. Not being a big UFO/ET fan, this episode kind of bored me. But it's integral to the show since this one introduces ""bigger"" agents and organizations that are there to prevent Skully/Molder from figuring out what's really going on (criminals that pose as aliens to break into your house to re-arrange your furniture and leave the stove on to run up your electricity bill, obviously). This gives us wanting more story than action a foreshadowing of knowing that the main characters will have to deal with more than just aliens (people now are against them).

WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR: Seth Green is in here. I usually like him, but he's a bit lame in this episode. Also, Skully doesn't put her finger on the gun's trigger. It's not very convincing for her to threaten someone when her finger is clearly resting on the guard.",1347062400,,958,4.5964912280701755
1338613,4,B00003RQND,"I'd give this pilot episode a 3.5-star rating. I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan, so aliens and extra terrestrials aren't my thing (I like Star Trek T.N. Generation, though).

Stating that, I doubt I'm not the only one in the same boat that was not impressed with a show ""dedicated"" to little grey men and UFO's (at least what most might consider is going to be the meat of the show). Don't get me wrong, this show is growing on me like a hairy mole, but I came back to type up my initial response since many might be put off to the ""first"" episode. You meet Moulder who seems like your stereotypical character and his fixation on ET's and UFO's...who works for the FBI (...fascinating). Then you have paired up, Skully, who is the stereotypical skeptic and demands scientific and medical proof for these ""unexplained"" endeavors.

So what's here that prevents the whole show from being a cliche aliens have come to invade, abduct, probe, erase memories, steal your cows, break your fine china while playing your Wii games, leave signs in your cornfield, and other nonsense you see in movies? Do we need every invading aliens movie stretched into a long TV series? Well, it's how the pair figure out what's going on with the clues that they have. They get these clues because their cognition (mainly Moulder's) is willing to listen to loons and accept the most coincidental accounts.

That's the saving grace for the show. All the elements for ET/UFO fanatics are there, but for the ones who want a well scripted story, this show handles the cliche themes with complex puzzle solving. You can tell this show is a bit dated with the lack of props or special effects (and somewhat mediocre acting), but the story telling is what keeps me from brushing it off as ""another Roswell"" show.

HINT: The first two episodes (pilot, 1st ep) are about alien stuff. Watch up to the 3rd episode (the humanoid killer) and you'll see the show has a lot more to offer than just aliens. Then you can come to your own conclusion if you really want to continue on with this show (I will after seeing the 3rd episode).",1347062400,,2087,4.572192513368984

The main thing to keep in mind with the first season is that all of the elements of the show are in place, it's just that there is no overall specific conspiracy going on like in the other seasons. All of the government and UFO episodes have a more generic feel to it. That is not a bad thing, but does pace things differently.  In fact at the time of the first season airing, nobody even knew if the series would last longer than one season. The remainders of the episodes are well thought out and are exciting to watch. The character Jerry Hardin who plays Deep Throat does a superb job in his numerous appearances that he makes. The cigarette smoking man makes a few appearances' too but his role is substantially less compared to other later seasons.
I would for sure recommend this season if you are looking for some good science fiction to watch. It is old school and raw, but it is better than most garbage on TV nowadays.",1323734400,,1181,4.2444444444444445

I was in awe, laughed until it hurt, dumbfounded by plots, emotional about the relationships and adored the actors.  Now that I've bought every single season, I can relive it over and over, again.

1338641,5,B00003RQND,"Let's start with the Myth-arc episodes: ""Pilot"" introduces us to the main characters of Special Agent Fox Mulder and his skeptical partner Dana Scully, MD. In a switch of the norm, Mulder is the believer (in extraterrestrials, ghosts, psychic powers, etc.) and Scully is the skeptic. Mulder's beliefs are fueled by the apparent abduction of his sister when he was younger. Scully's skepticism comes from her medical background. In the first episode, an apparent alien abduction tests both partners beliefs. ""Deep Throat"" introduces the titular character, an ally and informant of Mulder's. The Syndicate is revealed (a shadow organization that tries to undo everything Mulder is working for). Both ""Fallen Angel"" and ""E.B.E."" deal with crashes flying saucers. Finally, in ""The Erlenmeyer Flask,"" the conspiracy begins to be exposed: Mulder is kidnapped, Deep Throat is murdered, The X-Files is closed, and Mulder and Scully are separated. Very much a cliff-hanger ending...

But of course, The X-Files is renowned for popularizing the Monster-of-the-Week format in which unrelated cases are interspersed throughout the show's run. These cases make up about 2/3 of the show's episodes and are among the best. Topics range from psychic powers (""Beyond the Sea""), ghosts (""Shadows,"" ""Born Again""), rouge machines (""Ghost in the Machine""), scientific anomalies (""Lazarus,"" ""Young at Heart""), malicious creatures (""The Jersey Devil,"" ""Ice,"" ""Space,"" ""Shapes,"" ""Darkness Falls""), and mutations (""Squeeze,"" ""Eve,"" ""Fire,"" ""Gender Bender,"" ""Tooms""). The Monster-of-the-Weeks are particularly fun and, at times, are the best of the season. Stand-outs include the Liver-eating mutant Eugene Tooms, the ice worms that cause people to kill themselves, and the Eve clones.

The care and love for each episode is at times amazing too. Mulder's sarcastic quips and Scully's oft-annoyed facial expressions add an interesting layer of humor to an otherwise dark show. Every minutes either is action-packed, full of drama, or intense suspense.

The five star rating is being given, however, more out of appreciation than true quality. Sure, Season 1 had a few duds, most notably the odd snooze-fest ""Space,"" but for the most part, the show was very inventive. The ending (""The Erlenmeyer Flask"") was most notably striking as Mulder and Scully were separated and The X-Files were closed down. Christ Carter was teasing his audience to come back, and it worked. Season 1 was the first of several amazing seasons. But this now.",1322611200,,2506,5.4370179948586115

He also does not care about how he is percieved, and he takes his opinion of tooms, first seen in the episode Squueze, and lays it out for the world. Skully cringes, knowing what this will mean, and knowing how it will all sound. Likewise, she knows what will happen with this thing and just how bad it will be if Tooms gets out.

Eugene tooms is one of those doors that the X-files left open. They originally caught the thing and they brought it in, but the public was not ready for the 100 year organ eater that Mulder saw. This meant that tooms did not have to use the oddity it has to get out, nor does it have to really hide what it does. It simply has to be hungry and it has to keep its eyes open, looking for a snack.

Aside from being a great piece because of th connection to their first monster X-file, it also has the effects that make the mind marvel. I saw it when I was really young and it creeped me out, and these days it still does that. The fingers moving and the proof about the prints and other things that Skully finds are just as impressive as the dialog the writers put together and the way that Mulder seems to guesstimate how tooms will play.

Not quite as good, but still fun, are ""Gender Bender"" guest-starring the actor who would later return as Alex Krychek, and ""Fire"" guest-starring the actor who plays Baltar's lawyer on Battlestar Galactica.  Although these and a few other episodes are quite good, none of them stick out as my all-time favorites like ""Bad Blood"" or ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space' "" or ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"".

Episodes I consider completely skippable: ""Shadows"", ""Space"", and ""Ghost in the Machine"".

It is the perfect marriage of paranormal and sci-fi and is a real treasure for anyone who loves mystery, suspense and UFOs.  FBI has a secret division called ""The X-Files"" where two FBI agents, Mulder and Scully, are working together on resolving the cases that are paranormal in nature. Its central theme is government's conspiracy about aliens. The show plays around the idea that US government knows about aliens and conducts secret experiments which is a theme that rings bells with UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. Those episodes are known as ""myth"" episodes and they follow a certain timeline; in every season there are at least 3-4 mythological episodes. Because they follow a certain timeline, to make the best sense out of them, they need to be watched in order. But then there are those episodes that tells a story in one single epiode and they are called ""stand-alone"" episodes.

Whether you like UFOs or paranormal, you will find something you like in every season. The one of the reason for the succcess of the show in general is the chemistry between Mulder and Scully. This is not a romantic chemistry but rather a chemistry between two professional partners who are willing and open to understanding each other, through which they develop a strong trust, friendship and loyalty. Scully has more scientific approach; she needs evidence and she needs proof. Mulder, on the other hand, believes in the existence of UFOs and things of paranormal nature. They represent two opposite views but this creates a perfect balance for the show.

In Season 1, the series opening, we are introduced the characters of Mulder (Spooky Mulder) and Scully. 2nd episode on Disc 1 is Deep Throat which is the first myth episode. Some of my favorite episodes are ""Space"" (an astraunat sees a ghostly being in one of the space missions), ""Lazarus"" (has that Twilight Zone quality), ""Shapes"" (werewolf), ""Darkness Falls"". ""Ice"" reminds me of ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter. ""E.B.E"" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" are two other myth episodes. ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" is my favorite myth episode from Season 1. The only episode in Season 1 which will not give any scares is probably ""Beyond The Sea"", a dramatic episode.

This review is for Season 1 DVD box set. Until the Blu ray comes along, this is the best product (unless you decide to purchase the entire series).",1295136000,,2442,4.891304347826087
1338657,5,B00003RQND,"""Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted.""

The sci-fi benchmark of the 1990s and beyond, Chris Carter's ""The X-Files"" would go on to span nine critically acclaimed seasons and two feature length films in the course of fifteen years, making David Duchovny's schizotypal Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and his counterpart, the incredulous Dana Scully (portrayed by the lovely Gillian Anderson), into household names, and cementing the maxims ""the truth is out there"" and ""trust no one"" into the minds of countless steadfast devotees.  The series kicks off with a strong first season, beginning in 1993, and building the foundation of the relationship between our two agents that would best the kitsch of any drama in its timelessness and dynamic caliber.

There are a few stark differences between the seminal season and the ones that followed - most notably the diminished presence of the mythology arc that would really take off in Season 2 onward, and also the greater number of stand-alone, ""Monster-of-the-Week""-type storylines that constitute a bulk of the season.  What this means is that the first year serves as more of a vessel for character development than plot advancement (a trend that is still common today in shows such as Lost).  It also means that a lot of recurring characters have yet to be woven into the storyline, with the exceptions of the notorious Cigarette-Smoking Man, the elusive Deep Throat, and Assistant Director Walter Skinner who makes his first appearance in ""Tooms.""

As the series began to find its footing, and Nielsen ratings slowly began to increase, the show does not display quite the same level of self-confidence as it would in the years to come.  While this would result in a small handful of subpar episodes, it would also pave way for some fantastic ones, such as the dreadful ""Squeeze"" in which a contortionist hunts for human livers, and its aforementioned sequel, the even more dreadful ""Tooms.""  The brilliant Brad Dourif portrays a medium in season linchpin ""Beyond the Sea,"" in which Anderson's Scully shares the spotlight.  Other noteworthy stand-alones include the John Carpenter homage ""Ice,"" featuring an early appearance by Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman, the delightfully creepy ""Eve,"" ""Fire,"" and the tension-packed ""Darkness Falls.""

The negatives:  with only one foot in the water, the series had yet to reach the heights it eventually would with later seasons, and as such, there is some middle-of-the-road fare to be found - namely the near-unanimously despised ""Space,"" which suffers from a tedious script and hokey special effects; ""Lazarus,"" which isn't bad per se, but not enthralling either; and ""Fallen Angel,"" which, while featuring a terrific guest cast, suffers from a cheesy 80s-esque soundtrack and also weak effects.  Still the worst of The X-Files is still neck and shoulders above the best of some series, and only being the first season, these can easily be overlooked.

The X-Files was without a doubt the forerunner of science-fiction in the '90s, and is a must for anyone seeking engaging, suspenseful, and rewarding television.",1274313600,,3122,5.195219123505976

This review is from: The X-Files Season 1 (Video On Demand)
I was one of those people who caught Xfiles in syndication, thank you so much TNT and SyFy channels that I caught up just before the shows ending, I was avid, staying up all hours of the nite to catch the episodes I had missed. To bad they didn't release these dvds much sooner, but had it not been for syndication just as we are finding with Lost, and being able to watch it on the computer it reached an audience that never would of been able to catch up to its mythology had it not been for repeats bless em. Pilots and Finale's are the hardest of all to catch again if they even rebroad cast them. The finale I had caught again however I was never sure what the pilot was, I certainly didn't catch it as the original x-file watchers did those lucky few to have been sitting at home on a friday nite waaaaaay back in 1993 now 17 I can't believe it years ago.

For those lucky enough to have caught this pilot no wonder they came back for more, it set them up perfectly, just enough about the characters it was so smart it made you care about them right away...that is amazing.

It also told you why we were here...the character had his sister stolen in the nite and was hell bent on finding out what happened to her, and was such a gallant knight that anything nefarious was going to be exposed if he had anything to do with it, it showed a naive Scully who during the pilot clearly believed that the laws were created to protect people and that the goverment actually gave a damned and upheld them, poor Scully we find out later.

1993 was the first year that Fox channel had regular programming for every prime-time slot it had been around since late 80's but was piece meal until this year and X-Files was its huge break out, watch me show, besides the Simpsons and Married with children.

Creator Carter loved ""Kolchak the nightstalker"", and seems Scully was borrowed a big from Jodie Fosters ""Clarise Starling"" of Silence of the Lambs.

1993 a time when people who were raised on science fiction and horror films of the 80's came of age, it used stories it read in papers and I am sure conspiracy websites and such to get lots of storylines from....excellent writing, excellent acting, an hour on t.v. when the rest of the world fell away and we were totally engrossed in what was going on in the lives of Scully and Mulder. Fringe/Lost are the only shows that even come close to how interesting this was..and still doesn't quite match it.",1273968000,,2598,4.413361169102297

1338660,5,B00003RQND,"I must say that the first season gets off to a bit of a slow start. I have never gone back and watched a series and failed to see kinks needing to be worked out in the actors portrayal of the characters, i.e. Spock's goofy (at times) acting in the pilot episode of Star Trek. What I have noticed as I have revisited the series is that the clumsiness of Duchnovy is just about done after the first episode and completely worked out a few episodes after that. I have noticed that with Gillian Anderson (I am in the Third season now) that the building of her character is very gradual and natural. By the third season, she is wonderful (more so than before). I will also note that these are 1 hr. episodes minus commercials, thus equaling about 45 mins. Also, there are around 24 episodes a season and you get a bonus disc with each season. This price is more than reasonable! The original Star Trek only beats the X-files in terms of how much (length-wise) you get per season. Try finding that now. Not possible that I know of. And 35 bucks? Even if you were only moderately into X-files when it came out as I was, watching every episode and not having to wait a week in between each one makes a huge difference. I am only now beginning to realize how great this series was. And the episodes, while only under exception(a to be continued, for example) need be watched in order, there are huge benefits to not missing any episodes and seeing the whole thing in order. Anyway, you won't be dissappointed if you are a fan and perhaps you'll even be surprised as a luke-warm fan. And my humble advice is if you aren't quite convinced at first, wait till about half-way through the third disc. The second half of the first season was so great that it made up for the slow (though definitely not boring) first half. Only way to do it cheaper is to rent from Netflix, but after you spend a year or so (maybe an exaggeration) getting through the entire series, you might start it up again in a few years. And there's always passing it on to friends. Anyway, I recommend it however you do it. I'm very picky about movies, and as for tv, I normally don't even bother, but for me, this is one to own. I've got seasons 1-5 and will get even up to 8 where duchovny had no major role, also the two movies.

Also, I thought I would mention that the complete Twilight Zone last time I checked (here) was way lower than i've ever seen. I got it for 125. At one point, I paid 75 for season 4 and there are 5 seasons total. Also, the complete outerlimits is really cheap, though I've never seen the series, but will give it a try.",1266105600,,2609,4.281376518218623
1338661,4,B00003RQND,"If you are a fan of Fringe, you will love X-Files. Even if you've seen the show, watch it again! It's soooo good. The slim case for the season is very convenient. The only issue is a lack of special features, but nobody thought about special features when this was filmed so it's forgivable haha. This is a must-have.",1262390400,,317,4.389830508474576
1338662,5,B00003RQND,"As one of the fan group for those who ""boldly go where no one has gone before"", I'd like to advance a plug for a series which does a fine job of going where the paranormal has ever intersected our domain, and brings it into the house just across the street, or around the corner.
X-files producers consistently preserve their protagonists and often re-package and re-introduce their best antagonists, which goes a long way towards inducing a sense of viewer familiarity. The mythological and the arcane are welcome guests in the modern world of paranormal investigators Spec. Agent Fox Mulder, and Spec. Agent Dana Scully.

X-files do not presume to always conclude with a Disney Fairy Tale type happy ending.  You won't know at the beginning of the episode that you can always expect to be subjected to an autopsy, although forensic science is frequently employed.  And you can't rush to conclude that the episode will always result from or result in a tragedy.  Paranormal investigation, while often probing the unfortunate, doesn't necessarily preclude the humorous.  (Quite the contrary!)  But the unknown is ever present, from the opening credits philosophy, (The Truth is Out There) to the Ubiquitous presence of Fox Mulder's prominent UFO poster, ""I Want To Believe.""

Simply for the sake of avoiding redundancy, I'd prefer to post a few comments here about the overall series in connection to the pilot episode, which purports to examine an account resembling events which actually did occur. };-)  Simply stated, the occurrence of alien-abduction is reported as an international phenomenon.  What's rather more disturbing is the discovery on video of facsimile devices, not far removed from the kind of surveillance employed by our government against citizens in general.  They often bring up devices which are proto-type-related to technology that is built into NASA exploratory vessels.  And since the NASA program receives corporate investment for research products, on top of USGovt. tax subsidy, American investors have an interest only second to the military.  You can read about advances for any orbital interplanetary device, assured that it's undergone advanced testing for military usage before it was ever approved for a space rover project.

There are two episodes of Season Seven, which I would characterize as the most heart-wrenching in the series.
""Sein Und Zeit"" on disc 3, and ""Closure"", also on disc 3 in sequential order.  The FBI searches for a missing child and uncovers many awful secrets.  The theme revolves around finally answering the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha, which has been driving him on, since her abduction at age 8.  The Old Souls, and the Songs, and the Star-light, all are reminiscent of Alfheim or the American Indian view of a bridge over the line where sky meets the earth.  You can catch a glimpse of the feelings involved by viewing that Georgia O'Keefe painting of a loose suspended ladder, seemingly floating above the desert landscape amidst an aqua cloudless sky.  The answers were meant to be, to remain elusive, because they insulate us against a truth incomprehensibly awful.

In contrast, the theme that ""We Are Not Alone"" is, I think, most favorably illustrated by three episodes, the first of which concludes season 2, called: ""Anasazi""  on disc 6, and followed consecutively by two more episodes which open season 3, ""The Blessing Way"" and ""Paper Clip"" both on disc one.  I am admittedly biased towards the Navajo reservation people who assist the agents in their quest.  But the events which are precipitated by an earthquake are described in memorable (for me) terms by the Navajo Elder, as he warns his grandson to leave the snakes alone, ""they will be angry, and frightened.""  But, of course, Mulder can't leave the 'snakes' alone.  I only mention said episodes by name, because Amazon features each episode as available Video on Demand.  That's all new to me.  I didn't see all the episodes originally because I was either working, or the FOX channel they were broadcasting on wasn't available in our area.

If you're familiar with the Catholic tradition of 'stigmatia', you might find an episode of Season Three, disc 3 titled: ""Revelations"" of interest. I am intrigued by the seemingly open-ended treatment of this episode.  I don't recall seeing it revisited at all, though it is suggested that there is more to come.",1253750400,,4402,5.0848400556328235

1338664,1,B00003RQND,"I pretty much agree with all the reviews that give the X Files really high marks indicating an outstanding TV series.  However as good as the X Files are in this respect it is equally bad in the poor execution of the DVD's foisted upon the consumer by 20th Century Fox.  In my opinion the video quality absolutely stinks.  They unlike most companies DVD's used a really poor file compression technique that to me renders them almost unwatchable.  The only reason I did not return the set I bought for a refund was due to my love of the X Files series and I knew I would not be able to find any better quality DVD's out there for this series.  I did not buy mine here but purchased them many years ago as individual boxed sets for each season.  To give you an idea of just how poor the video quality is I dug up some of the old VHS video tapes I made when watching the series back when it was still on in prime time and they looked much better.  Some may not agree with me but if you already have some of the X Files on DVD look at them again and see if you do not notice that there is absolutely no dynamic range in the images, there is no detail in any of the shadows and most of the time there is a greenish tint in the dark areas.  When I first bought them I was viewing them on an old laptop and thought that the poor quality was due to a bad display on the laptop.  Then when I had the chance to see them on a good TV I was very disappointed.
I would only recommend buying the X Files if you just must have the X Files because of your love of the series.  Perhaps we should lobby 20th Century Fox to re-release the series on Blu-ray.

There were a handful though that I consider passable, but didn't really stand up the test of time.  The majority of the episodes on here I feel are still AAA quality.  I highly recommend this season.  If you are looking for extras however, skip this because there aren't any.

1338677,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files will go down as one of the most important television shows in history.  There are many reasons for this sucsess.  One is because of the pivitol relationship between Mulder and Scully, another reason is because of its brillant plot, and the final reason is the wondrous writing.

Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are probably the most famous twosome not to be in an intimate relationship.  Although they would develop that kind of a relationship in future seasons, for right know they are just ""friends"".  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson deserved Emmys for this season (they didn't even get a nomination!)  Scully and Mulder had very different mindsets.  Scully always believed there was a scientific way of explaining everything, while Mulder believed that there was a connection to the supernatural or extra-terrestrial life.  This was very important to the way the show works.  Science Vs. Faith was probably the most important theme to the series as a whole.  One of the most interesting things about the show is its powerful plot.

Plot is very important to the X-Files.  There was a main plotline going through the whole season that dealt with Deep Throat, an imformant who is shrouded in mystery, and the cases he gave Mulder to investigate.  Most of the standout episodes were related to this plotline.  Be prepared for a twist in the final episode, The Erlenmeyer Flask, resolving a little bit of this appealing plotline.  The other plots would usually revolve around one episode, with Mulder and Scully investigating a mysterious occurance that would be partially resolved by the end of the episode.  The writng for this show is some of the finest ever written.

Writing is an important component to what makes the X Files better then average.  This show has some exemplory writers, including the magical Glen Morgan and James Wong, who always pair up to write episodes.  Chris Carter, the show's creator, also writes some vivacious episodes, including my personal favorite, ""Darkness Falls"", in which Mulder and Scully investigate the disapperance of severel loggers.  The writing makes the show faster then an ostrich.  The X Files is one of the truly great television shows.

The X Files was not a huge sucsess when it was first on the air.  However, it soon became a worldwide phenomennon.  The reasons for this is its excellent cast, its superb plots, and its marvolous writing.  As you can see, the X Files had a amazing first season.

David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson became two F.B.I. agents no respectable TV viewer could live without. Right from the start, it set the arc for the entire series and we watched in awe as Carter and his fine group of writers turned television into something new.

Mulder was an Oxford educated profiler with such a great success rate it allowed him to indulge himself when he latched onto buried boxes of case files dating back to J. Edgar Hoover called The X-Files. They were cases which couldn't be explained or solved by any normal investigative methods. Mulder, however could solve them, not only because he was good enough, but because he believed.

The reason Mulder believed was the story arc for his insatiable need to discover the truth about what the government knew about alien abduction. Muldor himself, as a young boy, had been unable to save his younger sister Samantha the night she was taken, and it both drove and haunted him. Despite his brilliance, he had been tagged with the nickname, ""Spooky Mulder"" because of his belief that we were not alone.

His sucess had drawn attention from those within the circles of power trying to keep hidden the truth, so Agent Dana Scully, a beautiful and bright F.B.I. operative who was also a doctor, believing that science was the key to explaining what could not be explained, was sent to be his partner, and keep an eye on Mulder. What happened, however, was quite the opposite, as Scully became Mulder's champion, and buffer between his obsession and the powers lurking in dark corridors attempting to keep the truth just out of his grasp.

The show wasn't just about U.F.O.'s, or even simply the paranormal. It was an incredibly involving, complicated, and mature study of two people who formed a bond so deep that each found themselves unable to work or live as they wanted without each other. It never moved in the direction of a physical relationship, but something much deeper. Perhaps it is that maturity which Carter instilled in the story arc which made it so darkly romantic. Viewers knew that they belonged together, and probably would be someday, but not yet.

Each episode was exciting and so interesting that it made everything else on television seem boring. Muldor found a contact within the dark circles of power who came to be known as ""Deep Throat."" But when he got too close, it was Scully who would risk everything to save him in ""The Erlenmeyer Flask."" Mulder and Scully would tackle native legends, downed U.F.O.'s, murderous cults who themselves might not be from earth, even a couple of young innocent twins who might be part of an experiment gone chillingly wrong.

Always smart, humorous, and fascinating, season one set the tone for the entire series, and raised the bar for television drama for years to come. No one who loved this series will ever forget phrases such as ""trust no one"" or ""purity control."" Beautifully packaged, this boxed set contains six discs in three slip cases. The episodes which made us life-long fans of Mulder and Scully are as follows:

Pilot Episode--Deep Throat--Squeeze--Conduit--The Jersey Devil--Shadows--Ghost in the Machine--Ice--Space--Fallen Angel--Eve--Fire--Beyond the Sea--Gender Bender--Lazarus--Young at Heart--E.B.E.--Miracle Man--Shapes--Darkness Falls--Tooms (Squeeze Part II)--Born Again--Roland--The Erlenmeyer Flask

This was fantastic television, which would eventually find its way to the big screen. We can only hope that Duchovny, Anderson, and Carter will give us more somewhere down the line. The X-Files was one of the finest shows we ever had, and it reminded us what the medium is capable of, yet rarely reaches. Muldor and Scully were one of the great couples in television history, and Carter's creation may well be something so fascinating, so well-written, and so involving, we may never see anything like it ever again.",1200268800,,4060,5.094736842105263
1338684,5,B00003RQND,"I just finished watching Season One again. I've been a fan of the X-Files since '94, and my family has been giving me one season on DVD every year for Christmas. This year I'm up to seven, and I decided to watch all of them from the beginning.
The X-Files is even better than I remember. There's never been another series like it. Season One has some of my favorite episodes ever. In ""Space"", an alien/ghost accidently brought back to Earth during the Gemini program wreks havack on NASA's current shuttle lauches. In ""Genderbender"", Scully finds herself strangely attracted to a man who's a member of a very strange religous sect. Or is he? ""The Jersey Devil"" recounts the natural history of Sasquatch in the forest near Atlantic City, and ""Eve"" is the story of genetic experiments gone awry.
If you've never seen the X-Files, watch this series. If you've seen it before, watch it again. For me at least, the show hasn't lost its original appeal, even in the post-9/11 world.  You will be glued to your television. A warning though...

1338692,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files is one of the best TV series centering around the paranormal/bizarre/UFOs/conspiracy theories out there. The pairing of skeptic Agent Dana Scully [Gillian Andersen] together with Agent Fox ""I Want to Believe"" Mulder [David Duchovny] makes one of the best pairings in TV history.

The First season makes for a great introduction to the show, and there are some amazing episodes. Some of my favorites are:

1. Pilot - Scully is assigned to work with Mulder, she looks for the rational & logical, he is open minded to all possibilities, both in the realm of the real and unreal. Their first assignment takes them to rural Oregon, where they investigate the strange deaths of high school students, which Mulder believes is tied in to alien abduction.

3. Squeeze - one of my all-time favorite X-files episode. Scully enjoins Mulder to help her friend's investigation of a bizarre murder. Mulder finds a striking similarity between the present crime and one committed thirty years ago, by the same suspect. The suspect turns out to be a genetic mutant that needs a certain kind of nourishment to regenerate itself.

11. Eve - Mulder & Scully investigate the strange deaths of two men, apparently unrelated, but then find that both men have identical eight-year-old daughters who seem 'innocent' enough.

14. Genderbender - the agents investigate the murders where the perp seems to be both male & female. The trail leads to a rural Massachusetts town where a group called the Kindred seem to be involved.

18. Miracle Man - the agents investigate a series of deaths that seems linked to Samuel, a faith healer.

21. Tooms - the genetic mutant, Eugene Tooms is released, and Mulder takes it upon himself to see that he doesn't get away or commit another murder.

23. Roland - murders among a group of scientists that seem to implicate a certain retarded janitor.

I loved most of the episodes but the above were some of my personal favorites. The quality of this show is excellent on all fronts, and makes for compelling, thought-provoking viewing.",1184284800,2,2054,4.913294797687861
1338693,4,B00003RQND,"The first season of the X-Files introduces Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Mulder is a disgraced FBI special agent/conspiracy theorist working in the basement on unsolved cases known as x-files. Scully is a FBI medical examiner sent by the Bureau's big wigs to partner with Mulder to report and hopefully debunk the purpose of Mulder's project. As the season progresses Mulder and Scully's professional relationship transforms into one of mutual respect as Mulder, the believer, proposes unusual explanations for the events they investigate while Scully, the skeptic, trys to be more realistic. Their ability to counter-balence one another provides the show with two of the best characters we've ever seen on television.

1338696,5,B00003RQND,"Credentials and Summary: I originally saw a few episodes from the later seasons, and some earlier ones in re-run; we are now buying them season by season (finished #1) to enjoy from the start.  Recommended for those who like SF/Mystery/Suspense genre, with only a few minor concerns for the discerning, teen-age and older family audience.  Bit too spooky for young kids and the more sensitive adults.  Thought provoking, if at times absurd, for all.  Certainly outshines virtually all other material on TV (faint praise?), and is much better to be watched straight through, without commercials and without waiting for each new season.

Season One:

I had only seen two episodes before (# 10, 21).  Didn't realize virtually all themes and main characters present in first season.  Conspiracy and aliens, science/skepticism vs. ""believers"" (The Truth Is Out There), Smoking Man and Assist. Director Skinner, The Lone Gunmen, Deep Throat, family issues of Scully and Mulder and even a pre-Krycek appearance by Nicholas Lea.  The battle over the X-Files themselves is introduced in episode one and they get closed for the first time in the last episode.

Package:  We have the thin DVD set.  Quality is just fine.  We get more than enough just watching the episodes; I can't see spending a lot more for the extras in other versions.

Episode Summaries (with Themes):

X-cellent

1) The X-Files: Pilot (Intro, Conspiracy, Aliens) - Does well to sum it all up: Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder, Dana ""The Skeptic Scientist"" Scully , aliens, sinister government agents, typical plot (unexplained paranormal mystery, Fox sees it, Dana misses it, government covers it up).

2) Deep Throat (Conspiracy, Aliens) - Our favorite agents working against the government to find alien spacecraft.  A secret government insider contact is first introduced, nicknamed Deep Throat.  Features appearance by Buffy's werewolf ally.

3) Squeeze (Tooms, Creature) - Eugene Tooms' Gumby-like ability threatens every 30 years.  Mulder's (poor) reputation for paranormal explanations is first exhibited.

4) Conduit (Alien, Character History) - Related alien abductions detected via boy who acts as conduit for their continuing communications.

10) Fallen Angel (Conspiracy, Aliens) - Mulder almost exposes cover-up of UFO crash.  Max Fenig appears as a UFO enthusiast, and the first of various X-Files followers.

11) Eve (Urban Legend, Techno phobia) - Twin girls poison loved ones and fight to stay ahead of Mulder and Scully.  Super-human clones gone wild?

13) Beyond the Sea (Paranormal, Character History) - Death Row psychic knows where the serial killer is and what Dana's recently deceased father is thinking.

16) Young at Heart (Techno phobia) - Can Mulder's former nemesis really be stalking him, even tho' dead?  Must be a genetic experiment gone horribly right.  Connected to Mulder's first case, which went horribly wrong.

17) E.B.E. (Alien, Conspiracy) - Deep Throat knows where the Extraterrestrial Biological Entity is; Mulder and Scully follow the clues, and the package, all the way to the empty containment facility. The Lone Gunmen (hackers and conspiracy theorists named for the official theory behind JFK assassination) help track the package.

21) Tooms (Tooms, Creature) - Tooms, released on parole, puts the squeeze on Mulder.  Excellent scenes before judge and police investigators.

22) Born Again (Paranormal) - Mulder and Scully investigate link between young girl and string of murdered police.

24) The Erlenmeyer Flask (Alien, Conspiracy) - Alien viruses are being cloned, but Mulder and Scully lose the virus, the clone, the inside contact, and the key to the office.

X Marks The Spot

5) The Jersey Devil (Urban Legend, Relationship) - Mulder's reputation within F.B.I. really is spooky and so is Scully's date.  Wild man of the woods plot is cover for developing status of team within agency and the status of the X-Files.

6) Shadows (Paranormal) - Fox and Dana investigate revenge minded poltergeist.

7) Ghost in the Machine (Conspiracy, Urban Legend) - Our agents investigate killer computer.  DoD wants the software!  Sub-plot with Mulder's former partner.

8) Ice (Alien) - X-Files version of The Thing/Who Goes There? [SF fans?]. FBI sends our agents to investigate parasitic alien life form at remote Alaskan research station.  Features appearance by future Desperate Housewife and C.T.U. agent.

14) Genderbender (Alien, Paranormal, Religion) - Gender changing murderer hiding out with religious sect is sent searching for a new sanctuary planet by the FBI.  Agent Krycek makes brief appearance, apparently on a special, top-secret assignment.

15) Lazarus (Paranormal) - Dana`s turn with the ex, as co-agent who gets possessed by spirit of criminal.

19) Shapes (Urban Legend, Occult) - Mulder and Scully search for wolf/man Indian legend.

20) Darkness Falls (Paranormal) - Mulder and Scully avoid being cocooned by ancient insects released by unsuspecting loggers in the deep forest.

23) Roland (Paranormal, Techno phobia) - Mulder and Scully suspect autistic Roland in murders of aerospace scientists.  A favorite of wind tunnel engineers.  Roland later joins Bosnian rebels seeking revenge on Jack Bauer.

X-Out

9) Space (Alien) - Mulder suspects Martian spirit is behind Space Shuttle sabotage.  An alien thread not further pursued, and overall lower production values than typical.

12) Fire (Paranormal, Relationship) - Fox helps former British girlfriend investigate pyrokinetic man stalking the aristocracy.  Early lame attempt to start developing Fox/Dana relationship.

18) Miracle Man (Paranormal, Religion) - Our agents investigate healing ministry, when more seem to be dying than living.  A bit stereotypically paranoid.

However, Season one has quite a bit of problem with grain and this cannot be ignored. Strange, as the seasons progress, the quality gets better. I've seen the same thing occur with Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

What could've happened was Chris Carter filmed the first season on 16mm and then moved onto 32. I understand 16mm has a tendency to introduce a lot of grain if one is not careful to remove it first. Of course, that means more money spent which should've been the case considering all the hardcore fans out there who are more than willing to pay. Go figure. Hopefully the HD edition will satisfy.

1338702,5,B00003RQND,"`X-Files, Season 1' DVDs from the show which premiered in September, 1993, created by Chris Carter and starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson gives us a complete, but not especially `rich' look at a show which seemed to fill the void left by the fall of `The Evil Empire', and not yet filled by Arab terrorists. The filler was stories about `paranormal' phenomena, extraterrestials, and unexplained events in general.

I was not a fan of the show when it first aired, and I have virtually no memory of even seeing any of the episodes, so I'm looking at it with fresh eyes. The worst thing to have happened to the `X-Files' may have been the advent of several new shows based on FBI operations, especially `Numb3rs' and `Criminal Minds'. Both shows demonstrate agents operating within an agency which has returned to hero status it enjoyed back in the days of `The FBI' and, indirectly `The Untouchables'. In the new shows, the agency is never pictured as something between a sluggishly conservative drag on investigation and a positively evil bureaucracy with an agenda which is not entirely behind `Truth, Justice, and The American Way', not to mention logic and just plain good sense.

In contrast to the modern fictional FBI operatives, the show's agents, Fox Muldur and Dana Scully seem to operate almost entirely on their own, more tolerated than supported by their superiors. It's appropriate that most action seems to take place in a Stanley Kubrick cum Ridley Scott darkness and dimly lit environment. I'm hard pressed to picture a single scene done in the bright light of day under bright blue sky. The bureaucratic muddle is blurred even further by the occasional appearance of a mysterious character identified as `Deep Throat' who provides little clues and encouragement to Muldur when his interest or enthusiasm flags or he runs into a dead end. The similarity with the famous Watergate `Deep Throat' figure is obvious and I suspect the character is added not as a `deux Ex machina' to move the plot on when it gets stuck, but as a device to further picture higher levels of government as a cross between malevolent and stupid. It would have been an interesting take on the whole fictional backstory if the show had played the higher levels of the Federal government as they really were in these matters, indifferent and self-servingly protective of their own turf. This could have been a comedy precursor to `The Office', but I digress.

All in all, the show tries to entertain two opposing points of view, and work off the tension between them. One point of view is that the subject of Muldur's cases are not detectable by normal means, therefore, `official' government assigns a minimal staff to the `X-Files' to mollify those dimwits who actually believe in this stuff. The opposing point of view is that while these phenomena are not amenable to `normal' methods, they are real, meaning they are amenable to SOME method, as yet not soundly based in scientific procedure. A fine example of this is the discovery of the planet Neptune by its gravitational effect on Uranus. Astronomers couldn't see it, but they had evidence it was there, leading to newer telescopes and a knowledge of where to look, so they eventually did see it. So, if the `real' but unseen premise is true, one can be sure that `official' organizations would be pursuing it as vigorously and as rigorously as they pursue e coli contamination of spinach and terrorist sleeper cells.

To be sure, there are stories such as `Ice' where the danger is not `paranormal', but simply `new' and heightened by isolation from assistance. One problem with several episodes like `Ice' is that their plot is all too obviously `borrowed' from a well-known previous movie. In this case, it's `The Thing'. In other cases, the danger is simply a small extension from normal phenomena, so that to the normal mind, there is nothing special going on, except that our hero Muldur know things are not quite as they seem.

While there is much about the `X-Files' which may seem dated or improbable, it was successful because it is still entertaining in a melodramatic fashion. In fact, unlike all our modern cop and investigative shows, the two principle characters seem to find themselves in life-threatening jeopardy in practically every episode. In `CSI' and `Law and Order' and `NCIS' and `Numb3rs' and `Criminal Minds' and `Cold Case Files' and so on and so on, we don't get a major character in life threatening situations more than once or twice a season, and then only in sweeps weeks. The show also gains heat from the interaction between the two principal characters. In the commentary on DVD 7, the show's creator says they wanted to avoid any romantic entanglements between Muldur and Scully. In it's place, they have a strong regard and caring relationship between the two, not unlike the connection between Benson and Stabler on `Law and Order, SVU', except that the `X-Files' relationship has fewer internal stresses, and must simply deal with threats and strains introduced by the perps.

The extras on this DVD set are modest. On each disc with four shows apiece, the only extras are a few scenes for one of the shows in a foreign language, and it isn't always the same language. It ranges from Italian to Japanese and several points in between. The extras on the seventh `bonus' disc are nice, but not earthshaking. We learn, for example, that the name `Scully' comes from the Los Angeles Dodgers radio commentator, Vin Scully and that Gillian Anderson was pregnant near the end of the first season.

I've just recently developed a taste for these 14-year-old shows, and I suspect that the value of the DVDs is inversely proportional to how much you saw them when they first aired. If you are seeing them for the first time, you will like them.",1172620800,3,5831,4.860160965794768
1338703,5,B00003RQND,"I wanted to point out something technical about the slim set discs that I bought.  If you're looking for insight into the episodes or characters - please look elsewhere.

When I put the first disc of Season One into my DVD player, it started the ""loading"" process and gave me a disc error after about one minute.  Instead of cursing Fox (well, I did it later anyway) I turned the player off, leaving the disc inside.  After a couple of minutes, I turned my DVD player on and Viola!  I heard the X-Files theme and saw the menus (after the obligatory FBI copyright infringement warnings).

For those wondering, the DVD player in question above is a Philips Progressive Scan.  The same problem occurred on a newer Panasonic player.  No glitches materialized when I tried the discs on the Sony or AKAI players.  In all cases, I was eventually able to get to the episodes.  With the first two the screen sometimes showed up scrambled and the menus inaccessible.  On other occasions I was able to access a root menu similar to one you would see if you ""explore"" the DVD contents on a PC (Video_TS files, etc.), though the players would not load any content from these menus.  Speaking of PC viewing, I experienced no problems with any of the discs on my PC and all four programs my PC has to play DVDs functioned perfectly.

PLEASE DON'T READ INTO THIS TOO MUCH.  I don't work for Fox - I'm not trying to encourage sales of the more expensive sets.  This was just a personal experience I had, and it seemed to occur less frequently with Seasons 4 - 9.  My uneducated opinion: the equipment I have isn't top of the line, and maybe wasn't equipped to handle the way the content was compressed.  I was impressed that 4, sometimes 5 episodes were squeezed on one disc.  That's three - almost four hours of content.  I know - dual layer DVDs and blah, blah, blah.  But c'mon - even Lord of the Rings - Return of the King was issued on 2 discs!  (By the way, the content looked and sounded great.)

Another side note: Seasons 1 - 4 that I got were full frame, and 5 - 9 are widescreen.  At first I thought I had missed the option when purchasing these discs, but these are the only way I've found them at retail stores and online.  Nothing major; I just thought I was losing my mind at first.  (Which is still a possibility.)  I can't remember if they aired this way on television - I just noticed that the cinematography got revved up a bit starting with Season 5.  If this observation is incorrect, someone please feel free to correct me.

Okay.  If you have read this entire review give yourself a pat on the back, a cookie, I dunno - watch some old Doctor Who episodes or something.  A better price, better packaging, and better for you.  (They were giving out a carton of Morley's with the bigger sets, right?)  By the way - the 5 stars is based on my overall X-Files enjoyment.

The packaging for the fold out sets are nice in their own right but it gets annoying when you have to open up the entire set just to get to one disc. With the slim sets, there are two discs to each sleeve and they are much easier to get to.

NOTE: This review is for the original ""thick-pak"" set.

THE X-FILES Season One burst onto the scene for the burgeoning FOX network in the fall of 1993.  Powered by creator/writer (and later director) Chris Carter, the series immediately became a cult favorite, and by the end of Season One (24 episodes - incl. Pilot), word was spreading quicker than most conspiracy theories.

Carter introduced the world to Fox Mulder - a tortured FBI agent, who was ostracized and ridiculed by fellow agents because of his outlandish views and investigative methods (he was, after all, known to co-workers as ""Spooky Mulder"").  Did Mulder have reason for these theories?  He claimed that when he was a kid, his sister was abducted by aliens...

Keeping the scales balanced, the Bureau inserts Agent Dana Scully to work alongside Mulder, and to keep his ""crazy"" conspiracy thoughts in check by way of her traditional medical background, where EVERYTHING had a reason and was proven by medicine, math, etc; there are no ""unknowns"".

Relative unknowns David Duchovney and Gillian Anderson played their roles very well, and were certainly extrememly competent actors from day one.  I note this because so many TV series' debut, and never see a season two, let alone 9; and it can be tough to take the role seriously for some actors.

I'm not going to spoil anything, but the sexual tension and relationship between the new partners is great TV.  He comes from a more spiritual/metaphysical background, while Scully is pure scientist.

We find out a little about each Agent as the season wears on, but heavy character development happens after season one.

Chris Carter has said that he molded the show after the 1972 TV series Kolchak - The Night Stalker (one of my favorites as a youngster), and it's definitely feels like an updated/streamlined version with a hint of aliens and/or UFO backstory.

The episodes are not all tainted with extraterrestrial encounters, however, and other topics include: killer computers, the afterlife, shapeshifting, dormant blood-sucking bugs, and much more.

Notable guest appearances include Seth Green (Austin Powers trilogy), Donal Logue ('Blade'), Chandler's early g/f in 'Friends', and Academy Award nominee Brad Dourif (also the voice of 'Chucky').

My favorite episodes from season one are:
Squeeze - An AWESOME villain,
Ice - Even though it totally rips off Carpenter's 'The Thing',
Space - About an astronaut? Or something else?,
E.B.E. - A chase for an alien artifact,
Darkness Falls - What comes out when darkness blankets the land?, and
The Earlenmeyer Flask - Last episode of season one.

Least favorites are:
Ghost In The Machine - Great Police album, so-so episode,
Fire - Just kind of boring, couldn't really get into this one,
Born Again - and
Roland - what makes the last two episodes tough is that they fall right before the season-ending episode.

I enjoyed supporting characters Deep Throat and Scully & Mulder's boss aka Assistant Director Walter Skinner:  Mitch Pileggi (the superhuman killer in Wes Craven's 'Shocker').  Does Skinner support Mulder?  Whose side is Deep Throat on?

Really the only annoying episode is Beyond The Sea, Brad Dourif seriously overacts in this one.  It feels out of place, especially since nothing is as it seems, and the catchphrases 'The Truth Is Out There' and 'Trust No One' are the backbone of the series.

The audio is in 2-channel stereo (very lame); and extras include an 11-minute documentary, show overviews by Carter, deleted scenes, special effects shots, and more; plus there's a really beefy DVD-ROM section which covers all the episodes and has a cool little game which places you as an FBI agent.

If you love sci-fi or horror...THIS ONE'S A NO-BRAINER!",1165795200,2,3764,5.061588330632091
1338709,5,B00003RQND,"Going back to the roots of The X-Files is a really good way to see how great the show was back in 1993.  Starting out a little simple with its great mixture of the mythology episodes and stand-alone episodes, the season blends very well.  Neither of these two types of episodes show a dominance over the season, and except for a couple episodes (Space, Genderbender, etc.) they are all very entertaining.  This DVD set is being sold at a reasonable price (about $30 - $40) and much easier to get ahold of then the 7-disc set which raises the price over two times.  The bonus disc is not include here, so you'll have to deal with Deleted Scenes being the main bonus feature.  Also included are international clips of episodes in foreign languages, and special effects clips for certain episodes.

Notably Good Episodes:

Pilot
Deep Throat
Ice
Fallen Angel
EBE
Shapes
Darkness Falls
The Erlenmeyer Flask

This season comes highly recommended by me for X-Files fans and general TV fans alike.  There is a lot here for anyone to enjoy, whether or not they are a hardcore or casual fan of the series.",1165708800,,1095,4.632124352331606
1338710,5,B00003RQND,"Thank you to Chris Carter, David Duchovny, and of course new mother, Gillian Anderson, for inspiring me to write stories that fully capture my imagination.  During my years in Maine, I watched the first three seasons of The X-Files with enthusiasm and a sense of wow, that's so wild.  Anyway, I have been writing off and on over the years, sometimes I wished I was able to submit an idea or script to X-Files but the show started going downhill for me after the fourth season and I stopped watching altogether.  When I found out that X-Files was going to be a film, I was going to see it, but it got two thumbs down by Siskel and Ebert, so I never did see it.  However, I now own the Abduction DVD set AND X-Files : Fight The Future - the film.

It has been almost 5 years since the closure of the last X-Files case and Duchovny and Anderson moved on to other projects.  I enjoyed House of D by Duchovny and Bleak House by Anderson who almost won her second Emmy.  I doubt there will be a sequel to the first X-Files film because of bad deals a k a Fox won't give more money to Chris Carter so nothing has happened yet.

This is what I would like to see happen for the film sequel to be made by 2007 or 2008 : Chris Carter MUST settle the disputes with Fox; there MUST be at least two writers who get the show and are willing to come up with a GOOD story and script; and I think David Duchovny OR Kim Manners should produce and/or direct the film.  The Lone Gunmen and Cancer Man should play a pivotal role in the film sequel since they were crucial for much of the show's success.  The mystery of Mulder's sister MUST be resolved in that film or the next one. Some resolution for Scully and her new baby should be addressed.  The film should take place 5 years after The X-Files had ceased.

Robert Patrick's character should also be brought back in a supporting role as well as Skinner.  I am not sure if Annabeth Gish's character will be used but at least there should be a cameo for her.  The main character from Millenium, Lance Henerikson, would make a nice surprise cameo.  The film should be shot digitally so it can be instantly re-edited and re-worked and it would look GREAT on HD-DVD/Blu-ray.  Keep the film budget below $30 million, you will be able to triple that in a matter of months.  Finally, the film sequel should serve as a X-Files Next Generation Pilot, introducing new characters that could continue in a new series that can be made for syndication.

Thus, X-Files CAN continue with new characters and guest roles for Duchovny, Anderson, and Patrick.

If you are already a fan of the show, you know all the characters and probably some of the episodes on here. But if you shied from buying the DVDs because of the high price tag, this is where you need to look. The higher priced sets of this show contain one more disc than these slim sets. That extra disc contains only bonus features so its not like your missing any episodes, and for about half the price, losing that one disc is worth the sacrifice.

The first season contains classics like ""Deep Throat"", ""Conduit"", ""Ice"", ""E.B.E"", and the episode that really kicks off the whole conspiracy story, ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"".  For a person who is new to The X-Files, this is truely the place to start, mainly to prevent confusion.

I tuned into it when it first aired in syndication on TNT around the 4th season and didn't think too much of it at first due to the silly stand alone episodes.  I began watching it again a few months later and got caught up in it.  Subsequently I ended up buying every season and paying top dollar for each.  I was rather dismayed when the entire collection dropped dramatically in price a little more than 6 months later.  That said, I don't regret having the complete X-Files collection as part of my DVD library.  Everything about this series, from concept to elaborate sets and special effects was extraordinary.  The conspiracy story line was done well enough to cause even a skeptic to question some things. A number of the paranormal episodes were astounding while some other episodes were absolutely hysterical.  Some say it ran 2 seasons too long but the acting and scripts were even better after David Duchovny's departure. Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's characters were a welcomed relief from the chronic tears of Gillian Anderson and morbid demeanor of David Duchovny for many fans of the show. The 2-part finale was a bit disappointing and it's difficult to tell if that was the fault of the writing team or David Duchovny's lack of interest in the project.  Either way it's a piece of perfectly executed, mega budget, TV history and it shows in every episode.",1153440000,2,1446,4.7063492063492065

1338719,4,B00003RQND,"Since so much about The X-Files has already been written on this Web site, I won't add to the stockpile of reviews of what is arguably one of the greatest shows in television history. Instead, I will comment on the less expensive, albeit cheaply made, reissue of the show.

Although the DVD cases in this edition are slim, they are inferior in quality. Made by Scanavo, these flimsy cases have sharp-edged hubs, so you must proceed with caution when attaching a disc, since a slip will guarantee a scratch or two. Moreover, the hubs have teeth that can easily break off. Don't confuse these cases with the superior Thinpak cases, made by Nexpak. The Thinpaks are far more durable than the Scanavo cases and have smooth push buttons, allowing the discs to be attached and removed effortlessly.

The DVDs in these boxed sets also have flaws, but fortunately mostly cosmetic in nature. I have seasons one to six, and a handful of the discs have scratches or smudges. Granted, these defects are generally innocuous (so far no problems with the playback in season one), but who wants brand-new discs that look as though they've been thrown around a few times? One disc I received had a hairline crack in the center, so I returned the set (I can tolerate scratches but not cracks), which Amazon immediately replaced.

These new sets cost less than the original ones, but you'll get few extra features and you'll get shoddy quality. Those who can't afford the preposterously overpriced original sets will have to settle for the cheap stuff. (Thanks Fox, again.)

But I'll close on a good note. The most important aspect of any DVD is the playback quality, and in this respect the DVDs in season one reveal the truth: a good picture (generally), clean sound, a superlative show.",1144886400,,1770,4.7745098039215685
1338720,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. The inside DVD case is nothing special and even has some failings with some editions coming with a seventh bonus disc that is just sitting in a slot in a piece of card and falls out easily, bouncing around the box. However not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total for a grand total of 24 episodes. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. Disc 6 also appears to have some error on the menu system where if left alone it will turn black and white. It does not affect the playback on the episodes though. It is just shoddy work. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

The X-Files: Season one, delivers as a fine example of how such a simple premise can land like a bombshell on the international television scene. There are no real cheap budget restrictions evident either, as what is on display is mostly quality acting and storytelling using natural American environments. Most of the characters in the X-Files series are found in the pilot episode `pilot' on disc 1, however Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) doesn't show up until near the end half of the Season in episode 20 - `Tooms'. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) does not appear in the Pilot show, but is in the first episode. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) appear in episode 16 - `EBE'. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) makes quite a few appearances. The series gels from the word go with some enthralling SF thought and implementation. Not since Star Trek had the world seen a series like it before. Apart from a lot of episodes borrowing from films like `Wolften' and `The Thing' the X-Files was doing wholly new stuff that even movies like `Good Will Hunting' have borrowed from. Season one of the X-Files is mostly about alien abductions, government conspiracies, shape shifters, wild men, poltergeists, artificial intelligence, body snatching parasites, the face on Mars, UFO crashes, eugenics, psychics, hermaphrodites, possession, aging, faith healing, werewolves, alien insects, alien bacteria, reincarnation and alien DNA. Although many of the shows might not be completely logically and even have some serious plot holes, the general weirdness going on still makes the show one of the best ever. `EBE' is the most popular show in Season One, next to the cliff-hanger last episode `The Erlenmeyer Flask'. `Fallen Angel' is a classic UFO crash X-Files episode, `Shapes' is scary and `Darkness Falls' is a great original alien story. The bottom line for The X-Files: season one is that it is a classic. It is not necessarily the most conspiracy orientated X-Files season because it covers a lot of paranormal ground. The real bonus is seeing Mulder and Scully looking really young. What are you waiting for? But remember, you get what you pay for.",1144195200,27,5692,4.802242609582059

1338728,5,B00003RQND,"I've been a big fan of the series, which brought a uniquely forensic way of looking at paranormal activities and extra-terrestrial life, making it seem all so real.  The first season offers self-contained episodes, but also provides the recurring themes that would haunt the show throughout its long run.  Mulder and Scully not only bent gender roles but became one of the most memorable pair of television detectives because of their tight relationship. But, most important, Chris Carter maintained a clear vision throughout the episodes that tied them neatly together.

On repeated views, you can see where many of the themes were drawn from.  Some are rather obvious, such as ""Ice,"" which draws from ""The Thing"" (echoing back to the original 1951 version), and introduced Felicity Huffman.  Others are more subtle, such as ""Ghost in the Machine,"" which referenced back to ""Demon Seed"" (1977) as much as it did Hal in ""2001.""  All of this showed that Carter had just as much interest in classic movies as he did in conspiracy theories.

Although it is hard to figure out these fluctuating prices.  One day you can get the newly packaged series for around $40 per season, the next day it shoots up to nearly $90.

Based on this, Fox and Amazon are misleading its customers in calling this the Collector's Edition as though it were the definitive release of the show, when it actually contains less than the original collector's edition.",1138752000,54,526,4.811111111111111
1338739,5,B00003RQND,"The first season of the show that forever changed the way we think of government and of government corruption. The X Files stands alone as one of the best sci-fi shows in television history, and the beginning season brought it to a great start. While creator Chris Carter was skeptical about how the show would pan out, it turned out to be a smash thanks to its unusual and unique themes and star-making turns from leads David Duchovny and the Gillian Anderson (who, much to my surprise, gave us a butt shot in panties in the pilot episode).

The show's pilot is where you get drawn in, cornered with the depths of the unknown and the abduction of two young people by what Mulder terms are ""little green men"". Agents Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and Dana Scully are assigned to work together on an area known as ""the x files"", a department that is assigned to work cases that prove to be beyond normal comprehension and analysis. These are cases that no ordinary law enforcement or agent could understand, and that's where Mulder's strength lies...he believes in the presence of strange and mysterious life. Scully, very much a skeptic, is assigned to Mulder to track his work and report back to her superiors. This season, like the second and third, is chock full of explosive moments, corrupt people, and mysteries that many of us in real life explore and ponder.

Some of the best episodes of the season include the nailbiter season finale ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" in which Deep Throat is killed, Scully's skepticism is radically changed, and Mulder is ever so close to solving mysteries that surround him; ""Miracle Man"", in which a healer (Sam Bairstow) is framed for murder, and is then murdered before a conspiracy is exposed; the terrific gut-wrenching two-parters ""Squeeze/Tooms"", both of which showcase a horrific centuries-old murderer who preys on victims' livers; ""Space"", in which spirits haunt the crew of a space mission; and ""Darkness Falls"", in which little green spider-like insects terrorize a population of woodsmen (did this inspire the movie of the same name? probably not).

So if you have not exposed yourself to the X Files, you might want to start off with season one to get a feel of how the show works. If you find yourself craving more (which ultimately you probably will), then by all means go in order with the seasons (8 may be a little disappointing, but you'll still need to bear witness to it). For all of its triumphs and the sadness of its final season, The X Files First Season gets the show off to a rousing start.",1138406400,9,2542,4.733634311512415
1338740,5,B00003RQND,"Thank God!  Finally, after for several years having only the option of the very expensive original release of THE X-FILES DVD boxed sets, we have an affordable edition.  In fairness, THE X-FILES was one of the first television series to become available on DVD.  It was a moderate seller, but did not sell nearly to the same degree that most sets today do.  For instance, only a couple of years later BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER began being released in sets priced approximately half and sold quite well.  In other words, as a pioneer release there was not yet a sense both of what the demand for television shows on DVD was or what the proper pricing was.  I believe there are a very large number of X-FILES fans such as myself who have put off buying the series because of the exorbitant price.  This new release fills a major need.

There are very few truly landmark series in the history of TV, but THE X-FILES is beyond debate one of them. The show had illustrious predecessors, most importantly THE TWILIGHT ZONE, in which avant-garde darling Rod Serling proved you could write brilliant stories in a genre--the supernatural--that had previously been looked down upon. THE X-FILES is THE TWILIGHT ZONE's descendent that reintroduced the supernatural to sophisticated audiences, paving the way for subsequent shows such as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (which predated it as a movie but antedate it as television) and ANGEL.

THE X-FILES is also important for making long story arcs acceptable--or, rather, a bit more acceptable--to TV execs. As a rule, TV execs hate long story arcs. It makes a show more difficult for newcomers to ""get."" I actually did not watch THE X-FILES during the nineties for this very reason. I saw a few episodes, recognized that it was a superior show, but I also had missed so many episodes that I had no handle on the greater story line. While TV execs don't care for the long story arcs, instead preferring that each episode be self-contained and completely friendly to newcomers, there is absolutely no question that long story arcs provide a superior form of entertainment. I earnestly believe that when allowed to develop long arcs, television easily surpasses movies in developing sustained narratives.

Season One of THE X-FILES isn't yet the show that it would become. Instead of long story arcs, there are no story arcs. Each episode is pretty much ""the encounter of the week."" We deal with a new phenomenon, a new uniquely gifted person, a new event that demands explanation. So, there is a real sense in which the show isn't as good as it would become. Nonetheless, given the limitations of episodic television, the series manages to excel. The quality of writing, the marvelous development of lighting and atmosphere, and the consistently fine group of guest actors makes this an absolutely first rate season. The alien colonization plot that would become increasingly important in the seasons to come was barely present in Season One.  Yes, there were hints of a conspiracy, but it isn't clear that the show's creators were aware of where things were going.  As Chris Carter has acknowledged, they were making this up as they went along.

And what can one say of the casting of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson? The pair are such an iconic presence that it is simply impossible to think of the show and not think of the two, as if the two were linked to it by metaphysical necessity (like trying to imagine the original STAR TREK with someone other than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Kirk and Spock). They are not merely perfect for the roles; they are essential for the roles. It is probably not amiss to say that as soon as those two were cast in the parts, the success of the show was assured. Things did get complicated near the end of Season One when Gillian Anderson learned she was pregnant.  Throughout the history of TV, series have had to decide how to cope with the pregnancies of their stars.  I LOVE LUCY made Lucy's pregnancy an integral part of the show.  SEX AND THE CITY took a hiatus during the critical part of Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy.  ANGEL made Cordelia Chase the carrier of a demon when Charisma Carpenter was pregnant.  As would happen later on WILL AND GRACE, it was decided to pretend that Gillian Anderson was not pregnant at all.  As a result, towards the end of the season and especially in the early parts of Season Two, filming became increasingly challenging.  One can actually play a game noting how they hide her midsection in shot after shot.  She stands behind a lot of high tables, sit behind desks, leans out of a doorway only to have her trenchcoat fall forward to hide her stomach, and otherwise makes herself hard to see.  Nonetheless, her face got fuller and fuller as time went by.  Noticeably in the famous scene in which Deep Throat is shot, her's is very clearly the face of someone who is very pregnant.

The worldview of the show is interesting, and if there is an aspect of the show that I would quibble with, this is it. On the one hand the show is driven by a complete paranoia about the inner, hidden workings of government bureaucracy. Government is presented as secretive, patriarchal, all knowing, belligerent, and more than a little inhuman. On the other hand, all supernatural and alien phenomena and entities are presented as aggressive, hostile to human life, and unapproachable. The gap between Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and THE X-FILES couldn't be more pronounced. In Season One ""The Truth is Out There"" the intro pronounces, and what is ""out there"" ain't our friend. It has had some negative political impact as well.  My own feeling is that we need a strong central government to oppose the almost overwhelming power of large corporations.  Teddy Roosevelt became a trust buster only because he was able to expand the power of government.  In the past five years we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the prerogatives of Big Business and corporate interests.  Instead of increasing regulation and oversight of business, we see even more calls for less interference and yet more tax cuts.  Although the makers of THE X-FILES were left-leaning politically, I fear the show has help foster some attitudes that aide right wing causes.

Although the show started before the advent of DVD, it is absolutely perfect for DVD viewing. THE X-FILES is an atmospheric show, and nothing could be worse for breaking the mood than a commercial. There is simply no better way to view these shows than on DVD.  And now we can all afford to buy and not merely rent them.",1137628800,17,6599,4.772407732864675

Regardless, it's an essential purchase for fans as the mythology is established. What's different about this version vs. the previous release of the same title? Nothing but the packaging.

The transfers are the same as before. This set is packaged in slimline jewel cases vs. the more elaborate packaging for the previous more expensive edition. If you've put off buying the season sets because of cost, this is a good opportunity to get them at a reasonable price. The only part missing to this set is the disc that features all the extras.

All the seasons through the sixth are currently (as of 12/27/05)planned for re-release in the same packaging throughout 2006 as this reissued set. The good news is that Fox isn't changing the cover or the contents so if you've rented the previous seasons (or have a few of them already) you'll be getting the same stuff more or less but for much much less $$.",1135641600,26,1137,4.795918367346939
1338743,5,B00003RQND,"In the history of television there are good shows and bad shows, entertaining shows and revoulutionary shows.  Well the X-Files was one of the those great shows that was revolutionary as well.  I never really had a chance to watch the show until it was released on DVD due to my busy work schedule, but I can tell you that once the DVDs started rolling, I became a true X-Files junkie.  What a groundbreaking effort by Chris Carter.  Mulder & Scully have become icons in pop culture, extending far beyond the actors portraying them.  Duchovney and Anderson are awesome in this first season, still feeling each other out.  The rigid doctor/investigator and the out-of-left-field former serial killer profiler with a penchant for UFO sightings.  The show worked well right from the begining and never looked back.  The conspiracy was tight and crisp and filled with dark mystery.  The Smoking Man, Deep Throat, A.D. Skinner...  great characters right from the start.  Standout episodes include Pilot, Squeeze, Ghost In The Machine, Gender Bender & Tooms.  Overall, the entire first season was such a success because every episode was fresh and innovative and it rocked on every level.

1338746,5,B00003RQND,"It has been something like 7 years since this season came out on DVD and I finally bought it. If you are a fan of the show there is no doubt you will like owning it. Since I hadn't seen season one in its original order, for me watching it has been a discovery full of moments like ""Oh! I didn't know this was a first season episode,"" and enjoying seeing Mulder and Scully's relationship (however you may define it) develop.

A few minor downers: It seems like there could have been better extra features. I could care less about seeing a scene in another language, but I would like to see more about how special effects were done, deleted scenes, etc. I haven't watched the extras disc yet so maybe that will include more of that. I  found it difficult to access the deleted scenes or special effects info that were included, since you have to switch the option on and then watch for the X to appear on the screen and click it during the epispode. Although I turned it on for ""Fallen Angel,"" I never did see the X appear. I think the extras should just be separate chapters, not something you must watch for, to click during the episode. Unless you have done it before you don't know when the X will appear since they don't indicate what chapter it will be in.

A second downer: These sets are still far too expensive. At my video store, they are $100 unless there's a sale, and even Barnes and Noble has similar high prices -- $80 at the lowest that I've seen. Even Amazon is usually pricey, but I caught a sale on this season. $58 or whatever I paid is better than $100, but it should be a regular price, like most other tv shows on dvd. I can't imagine that these sets are still in such demand that they need to jack up the prices.

My advice -- if you don't want to buy used or foreign copies, save this set in your Amazon cart and wait for it to go on sale. :)",1123200000,10,1865,4.186629526462395

1338748,5,B00003RQND,"Nominated for 12 Golden Globes and 61 Emmys, including 4 for Outstanding Drama Series, The X-Files is one of the world's most popular science-fiction drama shows. Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...

The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...

The X-Files (Season 1) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the series premiere in which FBI Special Agent Dana Scully is first paired with Agent Fox Mulder to help in his work on a special project known as ""The X-Files"". While Mulder is a true believer in alien abductions and other abnormal happenings, Scully is a skeptic who studies the clues with a rational eye. For their first case, the two agents travel to Oregon where they study the cases of several murdered high school classmates who Mulder believes share the common bond of having been abducted by aliens... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Deep Throat"" in which Mulder has his initial contact with a mysterious informant named ""Deep Throat"" (a recurring character) who reveals his knowledge of the truth behind many X-File cases, and ""Miracle Man"" in which a man harboring the ability to heal people by touching them becomes uneasy when several such people die after being healed...

1338750,5,B00003RQND,"Being what i think myself to be one of the biggest fan on X Files (i don't want to compete), i have been seeing X Files since it first aired. I see episodes virtually everyday, but believe me, the first season remains to be one of my favorites to watch out for. Let me ellaborate a little.

The show when first aired Pilot episode,no one had imagined what it would be! TV was boring during those days here at best, but X Files changed the way fusion crossover shows would be done. There are at least dozens of shows which evolved from X Files itself. i remember episode 3x24 where in a restaurant a man heals a hit man with his palm, this was same as Roswell's pilot episode and what was to follow. Several tags, like the truth is out there!, trust no one!, Spooky became suddenly lingo of the generation.

Pilot episode was strongest episodes i have ever seen, series like Sopranos,Star Trek, SG1,Roswell etc don't even come closer to match the intensity of what X Files had just produced. Fox mulder's exuberance over an abductee case and Scully's insistance on finding a mundane explanation keeps us hooked to come to overall conclusion.

Deep throat -- all i can say is : the is THE best episode in history of X Files and perhaps the whole television( a daring statement).The background score (crisp and better than the x files title soundtrack), the acting, Deep throat's introduction was all so fast paced and so seamless that you wonder sometimes: if this episode was a movie or a part of series?!

Greatness was all over it.

Season 1 is where are all the charracters are introduced, and all the shows have the values that all of us have come to be fanatic about over the years of the show. I don't think price is too high for such a great show. Its worth the money folks!",1119571200,,1780,4.447852760736196

1338754,4,B00003RQND,"The first season of the X-Files isn't one of my favorite seasons in the shows nine year history, but that's probably becasue I've always enjoyed the conspiracy episodes more than the stand alones, the latter of which is abundant throughout this season, and even the few mythology episodes could be considered standalones [Eve is an example of this.] But the first season will always be remembered for a few things. It introduced us to Mulder and Scully most importantly, we meet Mulder's first informant, the enigmatic Deep Throat, and it was the season that introduced us to the more important aspects that would be visited later on. The only problem I really have with it is that it is primarily stand alones, which isn't a bad thing, but the first season has possibly the worst X-Files episode ever made, the mind numbing bore Space.

Pilot: Agent Dana Scully is assigned to work with Fox Mulder, and observe him and debunk his theories about the existence of aliens, and paranormal phenomena.

Deep Throat: We meet Mulder's first informant, who sends Mulder and Scully to investigate the near death of a man, which leads them to an investigation into the government.

Ice: Mulder and Scully go to Antarctica I think to investigate the mysterious deaths of four scientists.

Eve: Two men on opposite sides of the U.S. are found dead with puncture wounds in their neck, not to mention their daughters are identical.

E.B.E.: Deep Throat returns, this time to help Mulder find the whereabouts of a UFO, which is driving across the country to a government building. Introduction of the Lone Gunmen.

Darkness Falls:Mulder and Scully investigate the deaths of 30 loggers who died an identical way to the way 30 other men died 50 years ago.

Beyond The Sea: One of the best episodes of the season, and the series. Scully's father dies, Mulder and Scully visit a death row inmante Luther Lee Boggs, who claims to be physic. When he claims he can help Scully communicate with her father Scully begins to believe.

The Erlenmeyer Flask: So much happens in this episode, it's hard to sum it all up! Deep Throat is back, this time helping Mulder find an alien DNA testing facility. Meanwhile, Scully is shocked when she discovers that a ""purity control"" flask contains alien DNA.

The X-Files, when it began, was a show of unparalled standards. Keeping an open mind was the drive behind the initial show. At that time, there were no government conspiracy shows, no paranormal phenomenon, no ""scare-you-when-you-sleep"" shows. It was a breath of fresh air to those who were bored with the typical ""boy-meets-girl, ""boy-falls-in-love-with-girl"" brand of annoyingly mainstream show that seemed so prevalent up until that time. Even the crime shows couldn't compete; who could? The X-Files took your darkest childhood fears and turned them into reality.

Fox Mulder, X-Files F.B.I. agent, is trying to find out the truth behind his sister's abduction 19 years earlier. Dana Scully is recently assigned to the X-Files to debunk Mulder's findings. It's a match made in hell, according to the seethy government men who arrange it, or is it?

Throughout the cases, Dana Scully finds herself becoming more and more susceptible to Mulder's freakish theories, and wonders if he may not be right after all. It's a tumultuous ride that often leads to misdirection, but all in all, good storytelling.

The characters are great, the actors are great, and more importantly, the stories are original. Rent or buy this series, that's all I can say. You will not be disappointed.",1112054400,4,1445,5.03347280334728

Mulder is the "" Believer "" after witnessing his sister being abducted by what he believed as aliens when he was just a boy. His partner Scully is the sceptic, she's a doctor and questions everything in a scientific manner.

It's worth buying the box set of the first season for the following episodes: "" Squeeze"", ""Fallen Angel "" ""Eve"" "" E.B.E ""  "" Tooms "" & the superb Pilot episode which really sets the tone for the series

But honestly there is only a couple of episodes that would fall into the ""average"" catergory. They are all exceptionally good. A must for all X-Flies fans who want to relive this excellent series from the start.

The occassional viewer who enjoyed the odd episode may well become addicted after watching through this lot.

There is so much to like about this show.

There is the superb music from Mark Snow- the haunting theme is now world famous. The scripts were superb. The casting is also excellent, with great characters, and good chemistry between the main characters Mulder & Scully.

The special effects were also superb, and just got better as the series went on, but check out this season- not bad for the first year of a series.

One could forgive the writers for being a little rough around the edges however the end result is one of the most impressive first seasons of any TV-series.

I won't go into an episode summary as other reviewers have done a good job of that however I will state that the episodes ""Ice"", ""Beyond The Sea"", ""Fallen Angel"" & ""Darkness Falls"" were outstanding and really captured the moody, atmospheric feel of the series so evident in later seasons.  Both DD and GA give good performances with the limited material they had to work with and end up making poor episodes look watchable due to their outstanding on-screen chemistry.

The one thing about the X-files that has intrigued me the most is how unpredictable most of the episodes are - right up until the very end.  This helps to make the series a classic - one which can be enjoyed many times over.

As to the DVDs themselves.  All 7 discs are nicely presented in an attractive box with a booklet explaining the listed episodes and disc numbers.  Image quality is good and is of course in standard 4:3 aspect ratio.  Sound is straight dolby surround with no use of the subwoofer.

Deep throat was perhaps the best of them...with Fox MULDER an FBI agent chasing UFOs with scientific Dana Scully despite being warned repeatedly. The episode sums up the life of a believer in general.on the other hand Dana scully plays the contrary to perfection.

Deep Throat was the most fresh episode of not only X-Files but was also important for charracters to develop and story to move on.

I recommend its a must for all believers as well as non-believers and off course x-files fan would want to have this classic anyway. The pilot episode starts it with a usual sense(without music though)...",1109376000,2,1005,4.5777777777777775
1338760,4,B00003RQND,"If the X-Files had stayed true to its form of the first three seasons, I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best show that has been on television.  Even though it degraded over time, it's thrilling that the show that we came to love and obsess over has been preserved on DVD in its entirety.  Episodes like Ice and Eve are better than most movies -- and this wasn't even my favorite season.  In this first season we see more personal background and the development of the relationship between Mulder and Scully, even if some of the episodes are less polished than in the subsequent two seasons, which are really the best of the series.

The only hang-ups I have with these DVDs is the apparent lack of effort put into producing them, as if Chris Carter decided to just push them out knowing we would buy them regardless.  The documentary and ""extra"" material is inadequate and much of it came straight from the video sets that were out years ago.  The DVDs also tend to pause or skip slightly multiple times during the episodes (this also happens with the third season DVD set that I have).  When comparing these to the huge amounts of thought and effort put into, for example, the making of the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs, the lack of effort and quality here is appalling, considering the fantastic efforts put into the direction and production of the episodes themselves.

The X-Files deserves better.  But for a true X-Phile, it's still more than worth the buy. :-)",1108857600,2,1479,4.593155893536122
1338761,5,B00003RQND,"When the first season of X-Files premiered, I was finishing high school. Already, I found myself bored with the teen dramas, medical shows and cop shows that dominated television. Having always been a ""little out there"" among my friends, I longed for something to watch that appealed to my inner sci-fi geek.

And I found it.

Aliens, government conspiracies, genetic mutants, UFOs, vampires... Mulder and Scully seemed to find it all. And it all wove into a complex story-arc that spanned multiple seasons.

This show used pop-culture to generate its own sub-culture. Say ""small potatoes"", ""Spooky Mulder"" or ""ratboy"" to an X-Phile and watch their expression. They'll know what you mean. Suddenly, it was cool again to be a geek, to wonder about the Rainbow Project or Area 51.

And from there, a new era. Millenium, Roswell, Buffy, Angel, Charmed, Dark Angel, Smallville - all shows that I honestly don't believe would have seen the light of day had something not paved the way back for the extreme to get back into the American mainstream.

Season One was certainly not the best season. Definitely, the acting and dialogue could have used some help, but absolutely necessary to understand later seasons. Season One sets up the basic story arc.

Fox Mulder - former profiler, now basement dweller. In charge of the X-Files due to his obsession with the mysterious childhood disappearance of his sister, Samantha.

Dana Scully - impeccable pathologist brought in to debunk and rein in Mulder's wilder assertions.

Together, they form a partnership and balance each other out. Scully reins Mulder in, Mulder forces Scully to see beyond the easily explained. Their partnership develops slowly, from distrust to a far deeper relationship as the seasons progress.",1108598400,,1760,5.10801393728223

While Agent Mulder has a keen investigative mind, he also believes in paranormal phenomenon and U.F.O.'s, and the Department brass suspect that his questionable investigations will only embarass the Bureau.  What no one suspects is that the skeptical Scully will become Mulder's staunchest ally.  The first season of The X-Files, while uneven, perfectly showcases the potent energy of the pop culture juggernaut to come.  The classic episodes balance between alien agenda conspiracy (""Deep Throat"", ""Fallen Angel"", etc.) and monster-of-the-week creepiness (""Squeeze"", ""Tooms"", and ""Ice"") while the less successful ones (""Shadows"", ""Space"") still showcase the concept's potential quite nicely.  Just about every genre show airing since The X-Files hit big has attempted to copy its style or format on one level or another, so it is hard to believe that there was no show like BEFORE it came along - so powerful is the trend that it created.  While the show bloomed to genre brilliance in season two, the seed was expertly planted here, where Dana Scully first learned that the Truth was Out There.",1108080000,2,1217,5.2153846153846155

For the set, it's packaged nicely.  It's currently going for $35, which is a very good price.  More than half off of what it goes for at other places.  It contains 4 episodes per disc.

I'll get the other season sets only if the price goes down for them.  At this time, the prices of the other season sets are still overpriced, but at least not rediculously overpriced like before.  I'm not paying more than what I pay for the season sets of ""24"", which I have to say have been better productions.  Personally, I love the X-files, which is why I feel so strongly about Fox bringing the prices down.  I am enjoying season one a lot.

1338766,5,B00003RQND,"More than likely, if you were alive in the '90s, then you've heard of the worldwide phenomenon known as The X-Files. In 1993, Chris Carter created a concept so thrilling, so mind-bending, so thought-provoking and so downright intelligent that the series instantly became a hit with a large cult following. The names Mulder and Scully are instantly recognizable and have become permanent fixtures in American pop culture. The show would last for nine unforgettable years.

Season one is by no means the best season of the series, but it does contain many of the best episodes of the show's entire run. From Mulder and Scully being trapped in an Arctic research station with a worm-like parasite in ""Ice"" to Eugene Victor Tooms, the liver-eating genetic mutant in ""Squeeze"" and ""Tooms,"" to Scully's father's death and her subsequent experiences with a psychic death row inmate in ""Beyond The Sea,"" these classic episodes that made the show a hit are all together in one fantastic compendium. Not to mention, the bonus features, which include facts on alien abduction, commentaries by creator Chris Carter, and a season one ""making of..."" documentary! Whether you're a fan of the show or have yet to discover the brilliance of the X-Files (it's never too late!) pick up this DVD now and re-live a truly evocative television experience.",1105056000,4,1332,5.027149321266968
1338767,5,B00003RQND,"Every episode looked like a film. The pacing was unusually slow and deliberate, the scripts were well-written and it had the air of being a show for grown-ups. Neither of the lead characters were conventionally attractive, although they quickly became icons of the infant internet. 'The X-Files' achieved the impressive feat of being a genuinely fashionable sci-fi/horror series, one which it was okay to admit liking; ten years ago, Gillian Anderson was queen of the world wide web, back when people still said 'the world wide web'. After a year or so it had penetrated popular culture, and the first four seasons were unmissable, excellent, one of the best things on television at the time and since. It declined thereafter, and ten years have passed and we're older, but it still works. The aliens haven't come out of hiding in all that time, and the extra-terrestrial government conspiracies have been replaced by more concrete, less amusing official shenanigans, but it still works.

Having said that, the show didn't really get into its stride until seasons two and three. Season one is still very good, but the pacing is sometimes *too* slow, whilst the merest hint of an over-riding conspiracy renders much of the drama unsatisfyingly ambiguous. The 'story arc' eventually turned out to be as ad-hoc as the plot of 'Twin Peaks', but for a time it was gripping, and although later series also contained some one-off episodes, the sense of a grand masterplan being unveiled is missing here.

Still, it looked like a film. The budget can't have been all that big, but the few effects were flawless and the chilly cinematography and locations - a mixture of bleak forests and evocations of the vast American midwest - gave it a similarly haunting look to David Lynch's aforementioned oddity.

It's strange to be nostalgic for a show which was all about creeping unease, suspicion and fear and official lies, and we had different concerns in 1994 and the world was a different place. Each episode is of a consistent standard, and even when the plots are dull - I was never a fan of 'Tooms', although it was a favourite amongst followers of the show - the writing, and the performances of the lead actors remained interesting. 'Ice', the pilot, and the final episode are my personal favourites, although to an extent it's not the same experience if you don't leave a week-long gap between each episode (and notwithstanding that (a) you know how the series ended up and (b) popular culture no longer marches in step with the show).

There were several imitations but even today there's nothing much like it. Trust no-one.",1104537600,7,2622,4.885393258426967

If you want to start collecting X-Files episodes, this would be the best place to begin for obvious reasons.  In my opinion, all of the episodes are really good.  I don't think I even have a particular favorite except maybe ""Pilot"" and ""The Erlenmyer Flask.""  The season began with the Cigarette Smoking Man storing evidence somewhere inside the Pentagon.  It ended the same way.  The funny thing is that on both ocassions that this happened, these mysterious scenes were preceded with shots of Dana Scully looking at a clock that read 11:22, as in November 22nd, the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  That, to me, screams of GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY.  It sets the prescedent for the rest of the show, which is fantastic.  Again, I highly recommend this item.

After episodes after episodes with some good and bad plots, the first series really made me look forward to the next, then the movie. After it's emmy win, this show was the most watched on early 90s, but got stale after a bit, but then ends in a dramatic and shocking way, great.

If you remember watching this alone at home in 93, in your lonely home in the woods, and felt that fright, you should get this dvd and relive it. This is one of tv's greatest accomplishments, and is known worldwide because of its exposure of the FBI, US government and aliens.

1338771,4,B00003RQND,"What was great about the X-Files was that is was something different. The Fox network differentiated itself from the Big 3 by trying new things and pushing the envelope of convention, and the X-Files, along with The Simpsons and Married With Children, made the Fox network a great alternative to Murder She Wrote, The Cosby Show etc. The X-Files was the most creative show on TV in the 90's and if you found the show late in it's run, or if you have only caught the odd rerun here or there, do yourself a favor and pick up this box set, you will get hooked, and you will want to see where Chris Carter takes you. I haven't seen some of these eps since they first ran, ""Ice"" was great and still packs a good jolt or two. The two best shows of the season deal with the character Toombs, one of the scariest villains to ever grace the small screen. I also got a kick out of the forced partnership between Fox and Scully, and how they grow to develop a respect for eachother as the series progresses. There are a couple clunker episoded here, ""Space"" comes to mind, but overall the shows are really enjoyable, and will stand up to multiple viewings. Even if you are not a fan of the ""Conspiracy"" storyline the permeates a lot of the episodes, there are enough stand-alone episodes to make this set worth while.

1338773,4,B00003RQND,"The first season introduces us to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), a pair of FBI agents who specialize in cases that defy conventional understanding.  Mulder is an intuitive genius with a passionate belief in the existence of aliens and the paranormal, fueled by the abduction of his sister when he was nine years old.  Scully is a medical doctor, equally brilliant but rational and skeptical, unwilling to believe in anything outside the bounds of known science.  Their relationship, antagonistic but respectful and laced with sexual tension, provides the anchor for one of the best television series ever produced.

These episodes just get things rolling.  They are self-contained whereas later seasons will develop a complex (too much so, actually) mythology.  We are briefly introduced to the Smoking Man (William B. Davis), Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and the Lone Gunmen (Tom Braidwood, Bruce Harwood and Dean Haglund), who comprise a major part of the rich supporting cast that will develop.  Stand-out episodes here include ""Beyond the Sea"" (a serial killer channels Scully's recently deceased father), ""Ice"" (a deadly parasite infests an Arctic research station), ""Fallen Angel"" (Mulder races a secret UFO retrieval team to contact a downed alien), ""Squeeze/Tooms"" (Doug Hutchinson gives a brilliantly creepy performance as a dangerous mutant), and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" (which sets in motion the alien conspiracy subplot)./",1096243200,5,1461,5.524663677130045
1338774,5,B00003RQND,"There are very few truly landmark series in the history of TV, but THE X-FILES is one of them.  The show had illustrious predecessors, most importantly THE TWILIGHT ZONE, in which avant-garde darling Rod Serling proved you could write brilliant stories in a genre--the supernatural--that had previously been looked down upon.  THE X-FILES is THE TWILIGHT ZONE's descendent that reintroduced the supernatural to sophisticated audiences, paving the way for subsequent shows such as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (which predated it as a movie but antedate it as television) and ANGEL.

THE X-FILES is also important for making long story arcs acceptable--or, rather, a bit more acceptable--to TV execs.  As a rule, TV execs hate long story arcs.  It makes a show more difficult for newcomers to ""get.""  I actually did not watch THE X-FILES during the nineties for this very reason.  I saw a few episodes, recognized that it was a superior show, but I also had missed so many episodes that I had no handle on the greater story line.  And DVDs were not yet widely available.  While TV execs don't care for the long story arcs, instead preferring that each episode be self-contained and completely friendly to newcomers, there is absolutely no question that long story arcs provide a superior form of entertainment.  I earnestly believe that when allowed to develop long arcs, television easily surpasses movies in developing sustained narratives.

The bad news is that Season One of THE X-FILES isn't yet the show that it would become.  Instead of long story arcs, there are no story arcs.  Each episode is pretty much ""the encounter of the week.""  We deal with a new phenomenon, a new uniquely gifted person, a new event that demands explanation.  So, there is a real sense in which the show isn't as good as it would become.  Nonetheless, given the limitations of episodic television, the series manages to excel.  The quality of writing, the marvelous development of lighting and atmosphere, and the consistently fine group of guest actors makes this an absolutely first rate season.

And what can one say of the casting of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson?  The pair are such an iconic presence that it is simply impossible to think of the show and not think of the two, as if the two were linked to it by metaphysical necessity (like trying to imagine the original STAR TREK with someone other than William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as Kirk and Spock).  They are not merely perfect for the roles; they are essential for the roles.  It is probably not amiss to say that as soon as those two were cast in the parts, the success of the show was assured.

The worldview of the show is interesting, and if there is an aspect of the show that I would quibble with, this is it.  On the one hand the show is driven by a complete paranoia about the inner, hidden workings of government bureaucracy.  Government is presented as secretive, patriarchal, all knowing, belligerent, and more than a little inhuman.  On the other hand, all supernatural and alien phenomena and entities are presented as aggressive, hostile to human life, and unapproachable.  The gap between Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and THE X-FILES couldn't be more pronounced.  In Season One ""The Truth is Out There"" the intro pronounces, and what is ""out there"" ain't our friend.

Although the show started before the advent of DVD, it is absolutely perfect for DVD viewing.  THE X-FILES is an atmospheric show, and nothing could be worse for breaking the mood than a commercial.  There is simply no better way to view these shows than on DVD.",1094256000,6,3616,4.842019543973941
1338775,1,B00003RQND,"A simple review for simple people. The X-Files is a dreadful, unimaginitive show with a bad cast. Carter is talentless. He is the TV equivalent of M. Night, though even Night made one good film (Unbreakable). If you are going to spend money and time, buy the best TV series in history (aside from Patrick McGoohan's ""The Prisoner""), The Twilight Zone. You will never find better acting, bigger stars, better writing (can you say PULITZER PRIZE WINNER?!!) or better visuals. Rod Serling created the genre.

The X-Files is a well made box set filled with a bad TV series. Even ""Millenium is a better way to go!",1093305600,7,608,4.682242990654205
1338776,5,B00003RQND,"I caught up with the first season of THE X-FILES via these DVDs recently, and as ever I am struck by the freshness of the chemistry between David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as Mulder and Scully. Even in some of the lesser filler episodes you rarely get a sense of the two phoning in their performances like they were sometimes won't to do in later seasons. Already in the ""Pilot,"" you sense these two clicking along wonderfully, and it continued on for quite a few more episodes afterwards. It's quite refreshing.
Overall, this first season was quite good. Inconsistent, maybe, but that can be forgiven as creator Chris Carter was still trying to find the show's distinctive voice. It may not be quite a match for the second or third seasons, which have many great moments and episodes among them, but there are still some very entertaining and creative episodes to be found here, most of which admirably emphasize intelligent horror over hollow shock value. As for the so-called ""mythology"" episodes of the season, they are quite refreshing to watch too: episodes during a time when the mythology wasn't so convoluted and overblown, when it was all simply a matter of touching upon our embedded paranoias about extraterrestrials or our government instead of degenerating into the bloated sci-fi soap opera it was to become in later seasons. Back then, the paranoia was fun, as you can probably sense in wonderful early episodes like ""Deep Throat"" and ""E.B.E.""
**********
Thus, some highlights and other random comments on this first season:
The first four episodes of the show really set the wheels in motion for THE X-FILES. The ""Pilot"" skillfully introduced us to our two main characters, and ""Deep Throat"" went further with themes touched upon in the previous episode (as well as introducing Mulder's first secret source in Deep Throat). ""Squeeze"" was the first ""standalone"" X-FILES mystery, and it set an early standard for creepy effectiveness and sheer creativity of concept (admit it, the idea of a genetic mutant who can squeeze through almost anything is kinda scary). And ""Conduit"" was an emotional mystery that showed us just how much Mulder's experience as a witness to his sister's abduction had truly affected him. All four were near-great episodes that set the show up quite nicely.
I am going to respectfully dissent with those who bash ""Ghost in the Machine"" as one of this season's lowlights (although I won't extend the same empathy for the truly lame ""Space""). It is by no means great (it has its unintentionally funny aspects, like the computer program itself, a poor man's HAL 9000), but it's hardly as bad as others might lead you to believe. It has a good, creepy premise---in which a computer program suddenly gains human consciousness and starts trying to preserve itself---and at least it shows an attempt by the writers to craft good, intelligent horror instead of yet another sci-fi retread. I think it works, in parts.
Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong really distinguished themselves in this season as the best writers on the show. Their first collaboration was the chilling ""Squeeze,"" and if their subsequent ""Shadows"" was not on the same plane (a little too soapy for my taste), they came back brilliantly with the classic ""Ice,"" which truly put Mulder and Scully's relationship to the test as a parasite threatens to destroy them both. In later episodes such as the powerful ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""E.B.E."" they showed an attention to character detail that really made their scripts stand out among the pack (although ""Tooms"" was not quite successful at matching ""Squeeze"" for creepily effective scares). With one or two exceptions, Morgan and Wong crafted episodes that were not to be missed.
And of course the season finale, ""The Erlenmeyer Flask,"" which  insinuated that the government might have a bigger role in things than previously believed, and set things up nicely for a new season.
**********
Thus the first season of the X-FILES, not the show's greatest (the next two seasons qualify strongly for that honor), but a wonderful reminder of how new this show must have felt to many who first tuned in, if more in execution than in concept. Of course other sci-fi TV shows had shown us aliens and government conspiracies before, but never with this degree of intelligence and attention to scientific detail. This first season truly set the tone for the show that Chris Carter sustained remarkably in most of the later seasons, and for that reason alone this is the place to start if you want to get into this wonderful series. Recommended.",1089936000,7,4584,4.945525291828794
1338777,3,B00003RQND,"This is the series that started it all, its great for its time, but unlike the many series to follow now looks a little dated. Granted this series had the modest budget of an unproven commodity where as the series that followed had a considerable inflation of resources. This series still had soem amazing episodes but had quite a few clunkers aswell like Space and Ghost in the Machine. Over all you must buy this as it is history in the making.",1089590400,,446,4.451219512195122
1338778,4,B00003RQND,"Chris Carter clearly has found his niche as a writer. ""The X-Files"" combines elements of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" (a series I loved as a kid) with other elements (including David Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" where Duchovny appeared as a cross dressing FBI agent during the first season)to create a unique, scary and fun television series that captured the media & public's attention for 9 years.

Having purchased the first and second seasons when they first became available on VHS back in the 90's, I'm a happy camper that they finally appeared on DVD at a reasonable price. The first season looks exceptional on DVD. I had forgotten how good ""Ice"", ""Deep Throat"", ""Squeeze"", ""Tooms"", The Erhlanger Flask"", the outstanding ""Beyond the Sea"" and many of the other outstanding episodes were here. Some weren't all that great to begin (""Space"" being a prime example) but they only served to highlight how good the show was when it was firing on all cylinders.

The extras aren't quite as extensive as on later sets. We get a couple of deleted scenes from the pilot, international clips where we get to hear what Mulder and Scully sound like in other countries. We also get an 11 minute featurette on the first season where Carter and the other producers/writers/directors comment on the series and its formative first year. There's also a number of clips that were used for promos when ""The X-Files"" was being exclusively shown on FX network. These include segments were we meet some of the folks behind the scenes on the series including the special effects make up guy (who has always done a great job on helping to fashion a quality show that held its own against the best of TV and movies) and others.

If you're buying this for the extras, it's the wrong purchase as they aren't as extensive here as later sets. The original uncut episodes (including the deleted scenes of Scully's love interest)make this set worthwhile. While the price is a bit more reasonable than before, I'd like to see this set come down to the same price as ""Buffy"", ""Gilmore Girls"", ""Dead Like Me"" and other popular series. It seems only fair to make the show available to the mass audience that always supported it.",1088380800,5,2190,4.773087071240106

1338780,5,B00003RQND,"The fans of this very missed t.v. series will argue over which season really marked the point where the X-Files ""jumped the shark"" or reached its peak and went downhill from there. But there is very little doubt among fans that the success of the series began here, with the phenomenal episodes of the first season. Not every episode was great--and no other t.v. show had a perfect first season--but every episode was thrilling and fascinating. Among the best are ""Ice"", ""Born Again"", ""Tooms"", ""Eve"" and ""Fire"". Even some of the lesser quality episodes, like ""Ghost in the Machine"" and ""Shadows"", were absorbing. In any event, this is the season where you would learn the basics of the show, if you'd never watched an episode before. And while things twisted and changed, the groundrules were established here.

1338781,4,B00003RQND,"The overall premise of The X-Files is a very simple one. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)is a long time FBI agent whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid, and he has believed in the paranormal ever since. Mulder's obsession with alien encounters and other paranormal phenomenon, has caused him to develop the nickname ""Spooky Mulder"". He has been assigned to what the FBI refers to as "" X-Files"" that involve unsolved cases dealing with strange and unexplainable events. In order to insure this department is necessary, the FBI assigns a forensic scientist with a degree in medicine named Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson)to partner up with Mulder and keep an eye on him. Scully is highly skeptical, and believes that science can provide a logical explanation for everything. Mulder and Scully soon become an excellent team and use their different skills to solve the cases of The X-Files. As time goes on however, Scully begins to realize that her work on the X-Files is anything but logical.
Up until very recently, I had never watched a single episode of ""The X-Files"". I was always very curious though, because the show is filled with conspiracy, alien encounters, the paranormal, and the overall fight to find the truth of what's really out there. Unfortunately, I was never able to catch the show on FOX and the DVD sets were always so high in price. However, now that the prices were reduced, I decided to give the first season a shot. I was immediately blown away at how good this show turned out to be. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson brought their characters to life and made them convincing!! The special effects are great, and the show is suspenseful and creepy overall. But with how great the first season was, I could only give it 4 stars. While I was highly entertained by a majority of the episodes, there were some episodes that were just awful. In order for a season to be five stars, the season has to be top notch from beginning to end.
Overall, I am glad that I finally decided to give this show a try. After watching the first season, I am definately looking forward to seeing the rest of the show. The DVD special features are great by the way. Series creator Chris Carter talks about 12 of his favorite episodes, there are behind the truth segments from FX, a featurette on season 1, etc.. With a good first season, and great special features, I highly recommend the season 1 set.
A solid 4 stars...",1085011200,3,2434,4.6496519721577725
1338782,5,B00003RQND,"This is the season that started it all: The X-Files Season One. I watched this show from day one. For the most part, I never missed an episode of the entire series. And when I did miss it, I'd catch it some other time on a re-run or something.
When they started re-running them on the FX channel, I decided to tape every episode they aired, since they were aired in order. Then, once I got caught up with where they were at on FOX, I started taping those every Sunday night. I have every episode on tape, and every DVD set that's available.
This season was great. It was designed to stand on its own, since the series' future was uncertain at the time. But it had such great writing that the alien mythology stories could still be taken to another level if future seasons were to happen. And boy did they ever! We got eight more years after this!
This one is great to look back on what Mulder and Scully were like back then, and what the show was like back then. Comparing that to say season 6, there's an amazing difference. The characters and story really came a long way!
The special features are also a treat as well, since you get to look into where it all began and what it was like for the creators of the show to make a show like this.

1338785,4,B00003RQND,"The x-files season 1 box set is a ""must have"" not only for the show's hard core fans, but in general for everyone who loves, mystery, adventure, and good acting accompanied by intelligent script-writing and scientific elements. Two FBI agents Mulder and Scully meet for the first time to investigate a teenage alien abduction case in Oregon, which by the way is based on documented facts. Agent Mulder, an Oxford psychology Phd graduate, convinced that his sister was abducted by aliens when he was 12, investigates every case with an eye to the paranormal, while Agent Scully, who left behind a career in medicine, tries to put him back in the FBI mainstream by using her scientific background to explain the apparently unexplainable phenomena. This season contains no double episodes whatsoever except Tooms which is not related to the conspiracy that appears in the later seasons. I think that all the standalone episodes were excellent because Chris Carter used some of the most original, fascinating, and scariest stories. A brilliant combination of science with fantasy to solve the most mysterious murder cases that make every viewer question their beliefs, integrated into a clever, but frightening plot, makes up the first cycle of one of the most successful series in television history. Some of my favorite episodes are: ""Pilot"", ""Deep Throat"", ""Conduit"", ""Ice"", ""Eve"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"", etc. Another brilliant character who appears in this season for the first time and dies in the season finale is Deep Throat: The secret government operative who decides to help the 2 agents in uncovering truths meant to be hidden, who in the end pays the price with his own life. The dvd collection contains some interesting special features including a documentary on the whole season. The acting of David and Gillian here is not as good compared to the upcoming seasons, but the bond between the two agents is strengthened by what they experience together and everything they witness in their investigations. I enjoyed watching every single episode, (especially after watching season 9, which transformed the series into I don't know what). This is how it all began.

Sorry FOX, I really love the X-files, but i'm not willing to spend over $1000 to get all of the seasons. I really don't understand why they are so expensive. If you compare this boxset to lets say...

1338788,4,B00003RQND,"Before The X-Files became a global smash hit for Fox, it started as a modestly budgeted Friday night thriller that soon became a cult classic.  Then virtual unknown actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson starred as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively; both of whom are assigned to the X-Files: a division of the FBI which investigates paranormal activity.  Like many of Fox's other prime time shows at the time (except for The Simpsons and Melrose Place), the future of The X-Files was uncertain; so the on going plot lines and self-parody hurmor would not take full circle until later seasons.  This first season isn't the best in the series' nine season run, but it is a step into one of the greatest prime time telivision dramas to hit network TV in years.  Standout episodes include ""Darkness Falls"", ""Ice"", and ""Squeeze/Tooms"" which guest starred Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile, Salton Sea) who was one of the most underrated and creppy villians the series would ever have.",1060214400,3,997,4.916666666666667

Collecting the best TV-series of all time on DVD is almost a dream come true. These valuable episodes never worn off and you can watch them thousands of times! Alright, let's get to the business...

1338790,4,B00003RQND,"Viewing Season 1 of the X-Files is like watching an enclosed flower of deftly wrought magnificence beginning to bloom: petal-by-petal, episode-by-episode. It would be two more years before the series would reach its leafy pinnacle of creativity, and become one of the defining television shows of the '90s. Yet even this early on the brilliance and potential shines through.
Unlike the later seasons (6-9), Season 1 has an excellent episode every-other entry. The highlights include ""Ice"" (1x07), ""Beyond the Sea"" (1x12), ""E.B.E."" (1x16), ""Darkness Falls"" (1x19) and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" (1x23). Honorable mention should be given to the ""Pilot"" (1x00), ""Deep Throat"" (1x01), ""Squeeze"" (1x02), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1x06), ""Eve"" (1x10) and ""Young At Heart"" (1x15).
In contrast to the last seasons of the X-Files, the pilot episode is hilarious due to the awkward -- yet budding -- chemistry between the dyadic stars, the unperfected special effects and the outdated haircuts. Gillian Anderson has a hairstyle intentionally reminiscent of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). Her voice is also somewhat unmodulated. On the other hand, David Duchovny, whose wooden minimum acting style approach in later seasons became legendary, emotes normally in this season; thus, appearing as if he is ""over""-acting.
In prcis, Season 1 is outstanding in spite of its unconscious flaws and is a worthy addition to the collection of any fan or, indeed, the casual viewer. Buy it and you shall take your first toddling steps towards ""the truth.""

The X-Files' Seasons 1 through 3 are excellent.

1338791,4,B00003RQND,"Before i ever watched the xfiles (first episode i saw was Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose [CBFR]) i used to watch Star Trek. I probablly would have gotten the DVD's of The original star trek (if they even have it out) and The Next Generation, if i never even watched X-Files. Don't get me wrong, Star Trek isn't that bad.. but after watching X-Files, Star Trek seemed kinda boring afterwards. The thing that is soo different is the X-files generally stick to the storyline & has more action in it. If that wasn't enough, the gore (when they do show it) & the spookiness in it is what got me to like the X-Files in the first place. My fav. episodes on this set is..

It slowly evolved into a long, intriguing story line intertwined in Scully and Moulder's personal lives and it all started with this first season... terrific.",1047254400,,407,4.828571428571428
1338794,5,B00003RQND,"There is no question that this is NOT the greatest x-files season of them all, but what is terrifically fun to watch is the evolution of the series.  If you are a big fan, it's a hoot to go back to the very beginning, particularly to watch Scully.
It's amazing the character ended up working so well. At first, she was awkward and poorly dressed.  Gillian Anderson smiled more and was, frankly, a bit goofy.  Over the course of the season, she got her ""sea legs"" and it was then that the show really tightened up.  Anderson is always good, but it was obvious the writers (Chris Carter) were still figuring out where to go with her.
One fascinating thing on the DVD are the deleted scenes from the first episode. SCULLY HAD A BOYFRIEND!!!  They are in two scenes together, and it's wild to imagine how different the show would have been if they'd kept that character!  The sense of isolation from the rest of the world that made the dynamic between Mulder and Scully so cool would NOT HAVE WORKED.  Mulder would have been a loner, but Scully would have had a real attachment to the outside world.  A social life.  Can you imagine??!!
And the first season features the character Deep Throat too, who it's fun to look back on fondly.  Outstanding episodes include the two featuring Toombs, the guy that can stretch himself, and ICE, a personal favorite.  Yes, it's a rip-off of THE THING, but it is really well done and we finally start feeling the heat between Mulder and Scully. And if you're a fan of the ""conspiracy"" arch, then THE EHRLENMEYER FLASK (season finale) is really where it all got started.
We see the beginnings of cancer man, who was actually in the first episode, but no lines.  Also the character of Skinner was still in evolution, and he is certainly a jerk in this season.
There are simply lots of fun things to go back and remember. It feels like the best nostalgia...pretty amazing considering the show is not THAT old, relatively speaking.
One warning:  if you buy this season, you'll want them all.  It's that much fun...so make sure you're ready to get addicted.",1043884800,6,2085,4.554959785522788
1338795,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files really was a brilliant concept.  Four main elements launched it into television history:  First, the ""buddy"" television show pairing together a single man and a single woman working together has a long history, but it really hadn't worked well since ""Moonlighting"" in the mid-80's.  Everyone loves the potential for romance between the two main characters, even if nothing ever happens on-screen.
Second, millions of viewers had been waiting for a show with just a little of the weird and unusual.  Not like Star Trek, which is set in the future, but something set in the here and now.  Something (with a little stretch of the imagination) that COULD happen here.  Now.
Third, the actors were good.
Fourth, the writing was generally very good.
The first season's episodes work best when the relationship between Mulder and Scully is developed and/or jeopardized as in ""Ice,"" ""Beyond the Sea,"" and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask.""  Any episode that contained Deep Throat or the Cigarette-Smoking Man added even more interest.  Episodes that don't work as well are missing these elements, such as ""Space"" and ""Eve.""  Still, even the episodes that aren't the best of the season are still pretty good, better than the majority of stuff on television then AND now.
This first season collection is first-rate.  The episodes look crisp and clear.  The only gripe - not many deleted/extra scenes.  Still, a great package to celebrate the first season of a great series.

1338796,5,B00003RQND,"In September 1993, the US Network station FOX needed a TV show to help it stay stable. They expected little of this odd show from Chris Carter. It was called The X-Files and was a hit. It went from popular cult to become a global phenomenon. Never before has a TV show been so popular...except maybe Baywatch, but we all know half the viewers were just watching it for Pamela Anderson, don't we? No, this was a TV show of extreme quality and class. Yes, it was about aliens and the occult, but that didn't matter - OK, it did...but not to the extent that it was all they explored. Beneath the surface of all this sci-fi was the rare and unique chemistry of Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Played by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, the two were perfect for the roles of the two agents. This factor - along with the storylines - is the strong point of the show. The two are simply legendary characters in TV history and are definitely the most symbolic TV show characters of all-time. Except for, of course, Pamela Anderson's famous pair.

In the Season One opening episode - ""Pilot"" - FBI Agent Dana Scully is assigned to work with fellow FBI Agent Fox Mulder. The X-Files is opened; a series of cases in which the two agents are assigned by the FBI Headquarters in Washington D.C. to investigate unexplainable and downright freaky occurrences that take place up and down the US. Scully is the serious-minded medical scientist who seems to have a negative response to most, if not all, of Mulder's theories. Mulder, on the other hand, is the one that believes in almost anything he sees possible. He is incredibly determined to prove the existence of extra-terrestrial life, expose the government's secret plans and much more at any chance he gets. Scully is more laid-back on the whole subject and always seems to have a more believable theory on a certain subject than Mulder. The episode is very strong for a pilot episode and pulls it off to superb effect. The episodes throughout the entire nine year of The X-Files are split into two - the mythological episodes and the stand-alone episodes. The former deal with the sci-fi arc of the show which is its main focus, and the stand-alone episodes deal with a vast range of occult subjects such as grisly murders, psychic happenings, urban legends, religion, possession and much more. The mythological episodes are few and far between in Season One, but they are superior treats when they come about.

In ""Deep Throat,"" a tip from a secret government contact leads Mulder and Scully on a trail of missing test pilots and a possible government cover-up of a UFO crash site. In ""Fallen Angel,"" the future of The X-Files project is threatened when Mulder infiltrates a secret government cover up of a UFO crash site. In the episode ""E.B.E.,"" a UFO is shot down over the Middle East and secretly transported to the US. Mulder and Scully are sent on a wild UFO chase by Deep Throat, only to find it does not exist and they have been sent to distract them from preventing the truth - whatever it is - from prevailing. In the final episode of Season One - ""The Erlenmeyer Flask"" - Scully uncovers startling and shocking evidence that the US government has been secretly testing alien DNA on humans with disastrous results. Deep Throat is also killed in this episode and The X-Files project is officially shut down.

The stand-alone episodes of The X-Files Season One are all outstanding. Rarely does a television show produce top notch episodes time and time again, but The X-Files does it easily. Highlights include ""Squeeze,"" ""The Jersey Devil,"" ""Ghost In The Machine,"" ""Fire,"" ""Lazarus,"" ""Miracle Man,"" ""Shapes,"" ""Darkness Falls,"" ""Tooms,"" ""Born Again"" and ""Roland."" In ""Ice,"" the agents are stranded in a remote Arctic research station and stalked by a worm-like parasite that controls the mind of its host. ""Eve"" is a chilling episode in which the agents discover an eugenics experiment that has produced a race of identical, extremely intelligent and murderous children.

Gillian Anderson's shining moment of glory comes in ""Beyond The Sea."" Scully's father dies suddenly and they investigate a case in which the only way they can locate an elusive kidnapper is to enlist the help of a death-row inmate with psychic powers. The inmate also knows a message which Scully's father tried to tell her before he died. The episode is emotionally tough for Scully and Anderson is awesome when she confronts the psychic about how he tricked Mulder towards the end of the episode. ""Gender Bender"" is a misunderstood episode that many people find rubbish, but I find rather entertaining. Bizarre murders are committed by a killer who can change sex at will. The agents are led to a town with a simple and seemingly ordinary tribe, who is hiding a much larger and darker secret. I really was scared for Mulder and Scully when they returned back to the house of these strange folk in the middle of the night. Something about those people and the way they act frightened me to death!

1338797,5,B00003RQND,"The X-Files has been my favourite TV Show for a long time now, and the fact that they brought all the episodes of Series 1 on DVD, with excellent extras, is great!
Series 1 first introduced us to David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as the Government partners, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, soon becoming household names. Mulder as the believer of paranormal, and Scully as the scientist, they are the perfect partners, and the best of friends. In this series alone, they encounter mutants, ghost protectors, re-incarnation, government secrets, alien UFOs and many miracles, as well as Scully going through a family death.
David Duchovny brings a wonderful humour to Mulder and plays him very well, maing you like him instantly, and with his ideas, it makes you think that maybe he is right about the paranormal.
Gillian Anderson is superb as Scully, the series scientist, who thinks science can prove everything, despite her theories failing you have to admire her passion for science.
The extras with the DVD are brilliant, (There are so many, an extra disc is added!), I really liked the interview with Chris Carter. I thought the DVD-Rom game added at the end was good, and very intresting.
I think this is a brilliant buy, and you definatly get your money's worth. I recommend this to all Sci-fi fans and anyone who likes a good scare, now and again.",1041379200,,1352,4.8068669527897
1338798,5,B00003RQND,"Welcome to the The X-files, a, um, very original television series.  It follows FBI agents Fox Mulder, and Dana Scully, a pair who investigate unexplainable cases, many times extraterrestrial.  At first glance the X-Files is a rather odd show, and it is, but it is interesting.  The series is definetly the first of it's kind.  If you have never seenThe X-Files than maybe you are thinking it is sort of like CSI.  It is not, it may have very remote similarities but I definetly wouldn't anticipate this as an average CSI experience.  I don't know if it is supposed to be portrayed as that but it isn't, it's science fiction.  But this ""sci-fi"" is like Michael Crichtons.  If you have ever read his novels, the events in them could happen, maybe in the near future but they could happen.  Where not looking at Star Wars here.
  The first season is a good one.  It is not the best but it's not the worst.  Once you watch it you may watch a very boring episode, and there are quite a few of them.  There's not an exception for this season.  This season on the contrare is different than alot of the later seasons.  Just like ""The Simpsons"" and man other television series it is just developing in the first year.  The actors and writers are not accustomed to it.  Everything is new to [them]  The acting is excellent none the less.  And like I said this series is different, it's weird, because who's used to this.",1038441600,,1412,4.462745098039216
1338799,5,B00003RQND,"Absolutely amazing episodic television doesn't even begin to describe what ""The X-Files"" is.  Not unlike other reviewers here, I didn't catch on to the show right when it began.  I kept hearing about this great show and kept hearing about it until I finally caught an episode late in the first season.  I believe the first show I watched was ""Darkness Falls.""  All I could say at that time was ""what an amazing experience, why haven't I watched this show from the beginning.""  I knew at that time that I was hooked on this show until the very last episode was aired, which I was.
Normally when you watch episodic television, you may watch all the shows of a particular season and say to yourself that some of the show weren't that good.  That is not the case with ""The X-Files"" and specifically this first season.  Every episode in and of itself is pure electrifying entertainment.  There was never a show like this before its genesis and there will never be another like it.  Other shows may attempt to emulate ""The X-Files,"" but they only pale in comparison.  In this viewer's opinion, Chris Carter and his creation ranks right up there with Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings.""  What a wonderful, scary and intriguing world he hath created.  Here is where the mythology of the show begins and they carry it through with fluidic perfection all the way through to the very last episode of the ninth season.
Although the price for the DVD set's might initially seem a little steep, in truth they are a very economical purchase considering the amount of episodes and the extra features.  If you're even a casual ""X-File"" fan, these sets are worth the money.

I bought this first season set and after watching the pilot I knew that this series was one of a kind. Chris Carter had a vision for this show from it's inception. Not only did Carter and co. produce wonderful new monsters (or perhaps old ones clothed in new flesh), but he was able to start a story that would permeat the entire series. From the very first episode we find the Cigarette-Smoking Man lurking in the shadows. This season introduces Mulder's first informant known as ""Deep Throat"", and the season finale is absolutely amazing; providing an ambiquous future for the series as well as a wonderful book-ending for the season.

1338802,5,B00003RQND,"This season is X-Files at its rawest.  Duchovny and Anderson are trying to get into the groove of their respective Mulder and Scully characters.  Both actors look so young.  Anderson's voice is slightly more high pitched in the first half of this season than other seasons.  Duchovny looks good in any season.  Anyway, back to the season.  Pros: Pilot (such a strange episode.  Scully taking off her robe and showing Mulder her lumps?), Squeeze/Tooms (love the M & S interaction.  Some romantic inclinations between them maybe?), Ice (Great episode about worms in deep ice.  M & S point a gun at eachother.  Mulder is the first to put his gun down...interesting.), Fire (English caretaker has a way with starting fires.  Woman from Mulder's past brings out funny Scully.), Eve (Ma & Pa Mulder & Scully take care of not so nice identical twin girls.  For some reason I like this episode.), Beyond the Sea (one of the best episodes ever.  Scully connects with a convicted killer who can converse with the dead.  Anderson does a great job.), and Darkness Falls (bugs that can cocoon people in the dark in the woods.  Great suspenseful episode.  Love the outdoor scenery of the forest.).  Cons: Ghost in the Machine (even the actors hate this episode.  Not very entertaining), and Space (just plain boring).  Love this season--very different.  No mytharc episodes (creators did not know if they'll be back next season).  All episodes are great stand alone episodes (The Erlenmeyer Flask maybe a mytharc episode).  Buy this set and you'll notice the difference in character development and acting styles between Season 1 and the others.  Highly recommended.",1034380800,3,1652,4.970695970695971

There's plenty of mutants for TV's most popular FBI agents to battle, including ghosts, killer computers, pyrokinetic psychos, and human-eating insects. While great on the suspense and loaded with atmosphere, the season lacks the mythology that makes this series so great. Still, it introduces us to the characters and establishes the show's formula and great writing. Not bad, but certainly not the best season, either. It has great moments though. The pilot episode is great, as well as ""Squeeze"", ""Ice"", ""Eve"", ""Beyond the Sea"", ""Tooms"", and ""The Erlenmeyer Flask."" Mulder is established as the unconventional believer, and Scully the skeptical scientist. This season suffers from a lack of drama and character development. Until ""Beyond the Sea"", Scully isn't given the chance to shine as a character. And Mulder trods through the season chasing one monster from the next.

1338808,5,B00003RQND,"This X-Files collection should set a standard for all other manufacturers of series DVD's. While it may be a bit pricey (I got it as a gift, after toying with the idea of purchasing it for almost a year), it makes up for it by looking and feeling like a polished product - it seems that FOX went out of their way to make this collection worthy of the X-Files name - from the impeccable DVD menus, to the specials on the last disc.
The game, often mentioned, is a browser-based ""Carmen Sandiego""-ish game, in case anyone's wondering. It's not really fun to play, but then again, I didn't buy it for the game anyway, so for me, it's as if it wasn't even there.
The episodes on the DVD are some of the best ever made - from ""Deep Throat"", to ""Ice"", and ""Gender Bender"", and provide a detailed look into what turned out to be the show's most important year. The features are also excellent - from removed scenes, to interviews and special segments. In other words, there really is nothing that I can say about this set that is negative - and that includes the slick packaging with an informative brochure. I will conclude by saying that I've seen a lot of sets, and this one really tops them all (including the Simpsons season 1 set). Buy it, if you can afford it.",1023494400,,1260,4.343220338983051
1338809,5,B00003RQND,"I bought this X-Files season 1 box for one reason: I had only seen six or seven episodes from it... I bought it as soon as I knew it was available, with all the complications for a person who (back then) has no internet and lives in a country like Colombia (I ended up paying about 200 dolars for it). What I saw when I opened the box was a beautifuly made product. I was with a cousin who just said: ""that is just beautiful"". Then I started watching the episodes in order and I was stroke by the quality of the image. I watched the entire season in three days and I pretty much liked it. There are some stinking ones (like the infamous Space, The Jersey Devil, Fire, Roland and Born Again)... but I discovered some great ones like Ice, Beyond The sea (the best of the season if you ask me), Conduit, E.B.E... and well, I already knew how good The Erlenmeyer Flask, Deep Throat, Squeeze, Tooms and the Pilot were (although the last one I had only seen harshly cut by the FOX (latina) network in order to fit in the one hour schedule). There is no mythology per se in this season, but the UFO and extraterrestrial related episodes work pretty good as standalones. Then there is the season ender which is one of the best ever for the series... Actually this episode gives birth to the mythology.
The extras are good. But the deleted scenes from the pilot deserve to be mentioned appart.
This boxed set gave me a really special moment. I finally could say: I have seen the whole series to date.",1018742400,4,1491,4.328571428571428
1338810,5,B00003RQND,"I'm a latecomer to The X-Files. Sure, I watched the episodes sporadically over the years, but never really became an X-Phile until the first four seasons were released on DVD.
That's when I bought them all, and watched the episodes in order, from the Pilot episode in season one right through to the cliffhanger in season four.
I'm amazed by how well-acted and -scripted the shows were. And how unique. And special. I wasn't a huge David Duchovny fan...until I watched him do his thing episode by episode, year after year, on DVD. Now I truly appreciate Duchovny's somewhat deadpan style of acting.
Fox Mulder's (Duchovny) low-key, wry-but-witty take on life was a joy to behold. His one liners sometimes made me wince, but they showed his character's detached approach to life's often ""spooky"" surprises. Combined with his passion to find the truth (not to mention his abducted sister), these qualities made for a character unlike any other on TV.
I've been watching the new (season nine) episodes of The X-Files on TV at the same time I watch (and re-watch!) the episodes from the first four seasons. There's no comparison. It's amazing how far the show has slipped. Series creator Chris Carter said when he conceived Mulder and Scully, he purposely switched the traditional roles. He wanted Mulder to be the passionate, wide-eyed believer, and Scully (the woman) to be the scientific skeptic.
Well, the new episodes have flipped Carter's creative concept on its head. John Doggett's character is the skeptic. Scully is now the believer. Agent Reyes is somewhere in the middle. But without Mulder in the series, the show doesn't have the same feel. And the episodes have lost their wide-eyed (but believable) underpinnings. I mean, come on. Scully with an alien baby (or, at least, one with paranormal capabilites)! Agent Reyes wandering in limbo while Doggett tries valiantly to prevent the plug from being pulled on her! The episodes are now about the characters in the series, rather than on cases they investigate. I hate to say this, but The X-Files has become just another somewhat bland TV show. More a soap opera than a groundbreaking TV phenomenon.
But not on DVD.
DVDs of the first four seasons (all that are currently available as I write this) prove The X-Files began with a bang...and didn't let up for many many seasons. If you're new to The X-Files, or if you're not a big fan of season nine (the current and last), you can always return to the show's highly imaginative and unique roots with season one on DVD.
Season one contains some of my favorite episodes (the Pilot, Squeeze and Deep Throat being just three of many). I know the series gelled and the actors got more comfortable with each other over time (season two and season three are extremely slick and well-done), however I get a thrill out of seeing how it all began.
For fans of TV science fiction writing at its best, and those like me who enjoy watching a show's hesitant -- but brilliant -- origins, I heartily recommend the first season of The X-Files on DVD.",1016409600,8,3044,4.8

Ghost In The Machine takes Mulder and Scully on an investigation of the paranormal. They investigate the death of a buisness man in a high security high rise in Califronia.

The X-Files is easily one of my top five favorite TV shows, and to have 24 episodes in one package is a dream come true.(...)As good as this package is, I think that just changing a few things would have changed the rating to a 5. First of all, the video isn't up to snuff. I'm forgiving on this because it's a tv show, and wasn't produced for the intense video and audio treatment that movies are made for. However, in some spaces it really gets grainy. Some people say it is because they squeezed 4 episodes on each disc. That is incorrect. Four episode comes up to 3 hours of video. Walking with Dinosaurs, that came out the same year and about a month before this package, had three hours of video, but it had the best video of any dvd I have seen to date, with 30 minutes of extras. The picture looks especially bad in the Chris Carter interviews. I realize these are from VHS tape(I happen to still like VHS), but VHS looks allot better than that! Something happend to it during the transfer, becuase I have the VHS tapes and it does not look that bad. But as I said, I'm so thrilled with having all these episodes(maybe not ""Space"" ^^') that I can over look that. The extras are kinda on the limp-side aswell. I see only one thing that was created for the dvd, which is the short 11-minute documentary. It is interesting, but is far to short. I also wish the extras were time-coded, but what are you going to do.

1338820,5,B00003RQND,"There's much to the X-Files that's hard to defend. Whole Web sites have been devoted to nitpicking the science. Attempts to fit the X-Files episodes into an entire Universe view creates conflicts between the earliest episodes and later ""mythology"" episodes.
But forget all of that. What makes The X-Files great are the personal strengths and flaws of Mulder and Scully and their relationship. As with so many popular shows, it is hard to reproduce the magic found here, because we don't really understand how the magic works. It's human chemistry, and its science is more myth than flying saucers.
To round out the picture of this special series, add some high quality photography, quirky support actors and beautiful externals. Of course, don't forget the often-inspired writing, including some very wry humor: Paraphrasing since I don't have my disks handy: ""He's a killer, and a golfer."" ""Hey, I think you drooled on me."" ""Can I get this off my hand without betraying my cool exterior."" And my favorite, from 3: ""You're really disturbing me...On multiple levels.""
I could go on, but why bother. Either you're a fan or your not. Not familiar with the show? Catch it on repeats and see what you think. All that said, if you are a fan, I can't recommend the DVD collections enough. I have seasons one and two, and I have seasons three and four on my list. I may go all the way to season 6 in the end.
Why spend all of the cash?
1) You get every episode, with great picture and sound. Honestly, this alone makes the sets worth having
2) You get the interviews with Chris Carter originally included with the videos. They're often full of behind the scenes info.
3) You get the spots created for the FX reruns, including brief interviews with the actors. One of my favorites, long time cult villain Brian Thompson who plays the alien bounty hunter and comes across as a very mellow, soft-spoken guy.
4) You get some deleted scenes as well.
What's missing on these? Well, it looks as though season four finally adds commentary for a couple episodes. This is sorely missing from seasons one and two. In fact, if you had the VHS copies already and caught the spots on FX, you don't get that much in the way of additional extras with one and two. For instance, there is no apparent direct star involvement with these sets, such as interviews with principle actors done just for these colections. After all, extras help make spending so much worth it. It's hard to have too many.
Still, those minor criticisms aside, I consider both DVD collections I own a great value. If you're a fan, you will too - especially when you're in the mood for an episode, and the World Series is on one channel, and repeats from season 8 on the other. Whip out an early one and relive the magic:
""The answers are out there. You just have to now where to look.""

1338821,5,B00003RQND,"As a fan who was hooked from the 5th season of the X-Files, the light bulb in my head is FINALLY turned on after watching the first season.....particularly the pilot episode where the alien abduction of Billy Myers starts the X-Files going.  Am so impressed with producer Chris Carter as he introduces the themes of an ""international conspiracy"", alien abductions, and the prelude to the knowdledge of the government and the aliens spawning ""super soliders"".  The episodes introduce these themes and keep the original characters and storylines so solidly meshed throughout the first season and throughout the other seasons that this is prime viewing material.  And I love the pilot episode; the X-Files is so raw, so clever from the start that it is so much fun to sense the sexual tension of Scully and Mulder upon first siting of each other.  I love, too, that we learn the idiosyncrasies of ""Spooky"" Mulder (his nickname in the FBI), particularly his habit of eating sunflower seeds while concentrating and that he has a Ph. D. from Oxford University (his thought processes makes perfect sense now!) and how he confides to Scully about the alien abduction of his sister.
In Season One, there are 24 episodes.  My favorites include: ""Tooms"", about a very bendable 130 year old young man who resurfaces every 30 years to prey on human livers before he goes into hybernation (Tooms reappears in another episode) ; ""Eve,"" an episode about a set of sinister, ultra-intelligent and powerful female clones (and their offsprings); and ""Ghost in the Machine"", about the very playful but evil electronic machines (ATM machines, digital clocks, mail-room processors, etc.) that brainwash people into killing machines.  The episodes are so intelligent, so clever, so playful and so mysterious that you are hooked from the get-go.  And the teasing is immediate, too, as the first couple of episodes introduce the ultra mysterious and super-silent ""Smoking Man"" who is everywhere.  Who the heck is this guy and what is he up to?  Who knows.........unless you get hooked (I promise you will) and view the second season and so forth.  Very satisfied fan here.

I have tried other players and eliminated that as the cause so it's the discs - very frustrating, especially as I bought them some time ago and am way past the time where I can return them ( if I want to go thru the hassle of boxing them up and returning them).
This is a real disappointment, after all,who buys an entire season in a boxed set and watches the whole thing immediately??
As for the content - the good reputation of this series is already well known.  All episodes have strong and interesting plots that , while standing on their own, blend into a well articulated theme that permeates throughout the multi year body of work.  The stories are well executed by good actors. The scripts are well written and the overall effect is just great entertainment.

1338824,5,B00003RQND,"I bought this box-set yesterday  {if you want to get it as cheap as I did you might have to travel to Austria where I live, but hey, you'd save 15 bucks :-)!} - and already watched the first two episodes ...
It was like meeting an old friend, like the beautiful dancing queen you were dating with in high school - and know what?! She did not turn uglier than an old attic bat, but as a matter of fact she has become even more beautiful, as has this marvelous box-set of The X-Files (I).
I haven't seen a X-Files episode for a long time, but not because I grew tired of watching but the television stations in my country stopped airing it - there's only one channel who plays an episode every monday (pretty modest tv presence). Nevertheless, I watched an episode a week ago and immedeately after that the Fight-the-Future-movie I already owned on VHS for a couple of years which still belonged to pre-dvd era. I always liked the X-Files and always liked Fight The Future and I suddenly realized that I wanted to have the first four seasons on dvd at least (because after the fourth or fifth season the series had to surrender to repetition and descended to a mediocre program - the episode I saw on TV before buying the box-set was ""Trevor"" from the 6. season and altough it was thrilling, it was not exactly what I used to get from a X-Files episode; so I decided to buy I-IV or V on dvd and watch the others on TV - every Monday if that's what it has to be).
I had some doubts about the price first, but... for six dvds and a seventh bonus disc is not that much if you do the math. But as a lot of other people already noted, it's worth it. Every darn single cent of it.
The set comes in a very fancy package - although you have to treat it carefully because it is made of very thin cartonage -, the menu design is especially pleasing. On each main menu of the six discs containing the episodes, you got 4 episodes - by choosing one of them you are allowed to enter the specific main menu for the particular episode you have chosen. There you find language selections, special features concerning the episode your watching, chapter selec and of course a play-it.
Next to deleted scenes you'll find international clips in the section for the special features, but as far as I know there are only two deleted scenes and and an additional cut (but you have to keep in mind that this is a TV production and they probably did not keep much of the cut material - so this is ok, in the end, it's the x-files that matter and not the deleted scenes) - the access to the deleted scenes is unlike most of dvds produced before: when an X appears in the lower left-hand corner of the picture you have to press the enter-button and get the deleted scene, at exactly the place where it would have appeared in the series if it hadn't been deleted; when the scene is finished the episode continues.
The bonus on disc #7 is fun, but as are the spec features, pretty darn modest. For a collector's edition there is not much footage, but as I said before, it is ok. I don't think there will be an Ultimate Collector's Edition or something like that in the future, because if you look at Season 2, there is more material already - because they just have more footage left than from the original season. So do not worry, I don't think we'll wake up one day in bed and realize that we spend more [money] on an incomplete edition, because there now is the UCE with tons of stuff. Fight the Future, man, yeah!
The footage, although not much, is very interesting indeed. You get, like on almost every other dvd, the original television trailers from Fox - there a nice feature, but nothing of real interest. The making of is ok, like the behind-the-truth-segments which deal on things like how they got the main theme, or on the character Fox Mulder, stuff like that. I have not watched the interview with Chris Carter yet, but I am sure it will be satisfying.
The picture quality is fine - it's slightly better than the TV appearance of the X-Files, but of course you will notice that it is not crystal clear like most of dvd movies are, but there is one perfectly logical reason for that matter: what you get here is the best picture a former low-budget tv series could ever accomplish. Considering these facts, picture quality is fantastic - in my own opinion, a certain ""roughness"" of the picture only adds to the mystery of the X-Files. The sound is fine too, although Digital 5.1 viewers will be disappointed: The X-Files only come in Dolby Surround 2.0 - which is absolutely fine too me.
Conclusion: Good special features, very good sound & picture quality considering that this was made for TV, and 24 helluva episodes, treasured by every true fan, because although the files get better with every new episode, Season One is the true thing, the original first 24 episodes of a very cool series. The first step in a thrilling quest for the truth.

1338825,5,B00003RQND,"Los Expedientes X se han convertido en una de las ms famosas series de televisin d enuestros tiempos. Su xito se debi principalmente a dos cosas: 1) La buena produccin para TV y 2) los guiones basados en mitos (o realidades?) paranormales que acogieron con entusiasmo los amantes de lo oculto.
En mi opinin las tres primeras temporadas son muy, muy  buenas y es una lstima que los productores se hayan dejado llevar ms por el dinero que ganaban, que por cerrar con broche de oro la seri de X files. Como resultado siguieron haciendo ms y ms temporadas y hasta una pelcula con temas muy rebuscados y francamente malos. Sin embargo esa metida de pata no opaca esas primeras 3 temporadas donde Mulder sospecha de un complot mundial para ocultar OVNIS; Scully es raptada por extraterrestres y... las potencias mundiales trabajan en secreto con tecnologa extraterrestre.
El paquete de DVDs est verdaderamente de lujo. Tiene subttulos en espaol, pero no doblaje. Aunque no muy impresionante, el sonido SI est en Surround.
Precaucin: los DVDs estn en rea 1, as que se necesita en Amrica Latina un reproductor multiregin para verlos. Yo tengo un reproductor Philco multiregin y fueron bien aceptados.
Por ltimo he de mencionar que esta coleccin es SOLO PARA AUTNTICOS FANS. Por qu? ...el 7o disco de la coleccin,  solo contiene unas cuantas entrevistas y cortos. No es muy bueno en realidad.

(The producers were not sure there would be a second season to carry that storyline along). There is not much in the way of extra content, mostly dubbed clips in other lanquages. I do like watching a complete episode in 40 minutes. My wife and I put a CD in when there is nothing worth watching on TV and watch two episodes. Video and sound quality is great.

Its all here, the first 24 episodes and bonus materials on seven disks put together in a very nice fold out box package.  It was nice to go back and watch the episodes in order and commercial free; back in the day when Deep Throat was Mulder's informant and the first appearance of the Lone Gunmen in E.B.E.  Season One had some great episodes, some of my favorites were Pilot, Beyond the Sea, Fallen Angel and Ice.

1338829,5,B00003RQND,"I rarely watched X-Files on TV but I became a true fan when we bought the first season. We eagerly waited for seasons 2 and 3 and snatched them up when they first came out. This Season 1 DVD has that weird ""tooms"" episode that they seem to show repeatedly in syndication, but also the earlier version of tooms in ""conduit""
Also if you want the first episode to see how Scully met Mulder ... well, this one is a must buy!
If you have never seen X-Files before then here's the brief skinny. It's about FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Scully is the skeptic with the medical background and Mulder is the guy who believes in psychic phenomenon and earns the somewhat odd title ""Spooky Mulder"" by many of his associates. You keep wanting Mulder and Scully to get together in this series, which is the one thing Chris Carter (the creator) didn't want to happen.
It kind of reminds a bit of the old Twilight Zones but often with endings which leave you fascinated that you learned that ... the truth is out there.",990316800,,1012,4.388297872340425
1338830,5,B00003RQND,"There is good news for X-Files fans who weren't there in the beginning.  This package is the entire first season, every last episode, Chris Carter commentary, tv spot, coming attraction and FX inter-commercial spot.  Here is the original show, before the mythology, before the plot archs that moved at glacial pace, before Chris Carter started beating a dead horse and trying to keep a sinking ship afloat with a God-awful sixth season and a virtually dead seventh (6th and 7th season fans can now flame me with awful threats!)
Watching these early episodes, you can sense the freshness, the original flavor of the show, the inventiveness and unique stylings of both the writing and the acting.  Gillian Anderson is one of the most important acting finds of the last ten years and it will be a great relief when the show is finally moribund and she has the freedom to move into the land of film as American's own Emma Thompson.  Here in this first season you can see her outshine everyone, bringing to life the character of Dana Scully, a cold hard skeptic with a soft heart, a sad-eyed suffering woman who has performed autopsies of horribly mutilated crime victims, who can use a handgun in combat-like police action, but who is also struggling with her own loneliness and strange fascination with her alien and paranormal obsessed partner, Fox Mulder.  In the episode ""Beyond The Sea"" which featured a tour de force performance by Brad Dourif, Anderson does an extraordinary job with Scully's pain and loss and fear of the supernatural.
David Duchovny was also a unique find.  Twin Peaks fans may have been thrilled to recognize Denise the Transvestite FBI Agent as Fox Mulder.  And the X-Files bears more than a passing resemblance to Twin Peaks, which also went off the map with the FBI meets shamanism, Tibetan mysticism and European-style surrealism.  In these early episodes, Fox Mulder is still flying under the radar of the evil powers behind the conspiracy.  He is a little bug up against a powerful syndicate of para-military, industrial-complex Pentagon-based shadow governments.  In ""Deep Throat"" and ""Fallen Angel"", Mulder stretches beyond FBI protocol to penetrate behind enemy-lines, his every move monitored, not just by the sinister Cigarette Smoking Man of the Pentagon, but by groups like NICAP and MUFON who look up to him like a hero.  It is to Chris Carter's great shame that in later episodes, he neglected to follow up the connections between Mulder and the conspiracy groups.  There was an attempt to concentrate them all into the Lone Gunman, who didn't appear until the second season, and then only fleeting, but Mulder needed a whole network of grass roots helpers.  There is more of a sense on this in the early episodes.
On the other hand, these episodes were done when the show was still taking shape.  The powerful UFO episodes were interpersed with Monster-of-the-Week episodes like ""The Jersey Devil"" and the truly awful ""Space"" which is an essay in bad writing. But some of the gems that stands out as individual little masterpieces is ""Eve"" and ""Ice.""  The later, clearly inspired by the 1950's sci-fi film ""The Thing"" is one of the tightest dramas that the X-Files ever produced.
Those who want to trace the full arch of the conspiracy that spanned the entire run of the show, would do best to catch the final episode ""The Erhlenmeyer Flask"".  It was a big bang finale for the first season and a powerful teaser for viewers to suffer through an X-File-less summer waiting for more.",985305600,7,3520,4.880872483221476

1338833,5,B00003RQND,"When the original ""Pilot"" episode of  ""The X-Files"" aired back in 1993, no one would have guessed that it would grow from a little cult show that sci-fi nerds watched on weekends, to a world-wide phenomena, winning numerous awards and sky-high ratings, spawning a hit feature film and countless amounts of sought-after memorabilia, carrying strongly eight (plus?) seasons, ultimately pulling actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson into superstar status.  No one would have guessed that David and Gillian would appear on countless magazines, from Newsweek to TV Guide, and the show would be labeled ""Star Trek of the `90's.""  Except while ""Star Trek"" remained exclusively under the category of cult status, ""The X-Files"" is watched regularly in thousands of homes across the world, and its star actors appear on the hottest talk shows.
Finally, you can own the first two complete seasons of  ""The X-Files"" on DVD.  In ""Pilot"" we're introduced to the young and intelligent Special Agent Dana Scully (Gilllian Anderson) who is newly assigned to work with Agent Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) on the X-Files Project.  Her job in the beginning is to spy on Mulder--to debunk his work, but before the end of the season, we see their relationship develop into a grudging respect and trust, and she truly becomes his partner.
In the beginning, Mulder seems to live up to his nickname ""Spooky.""  He is simultaneously brilliant and passionate, yet seems to believe everything out of the realms of science, much to the frustration of his more scientifically-inclined partner.  However, in the first season, we quickly learn to trust Mulder's intuition because more often than not, his wild theories turn out to be more correct than Scully's logical rationalizations.
When I bought this amazing box set, I sat down and watched every episode back-to-back.  It's interesting to be able to compare the Mulder/Scully relationship back then to the way it is presently.  In the first season, they frustrated each other.  Now, they can't seem to function without one another.  So much character development has occurred since the first season, when almost every episode was a monster-of-the-week episode.  The conspiracy or mythology arcs really didn't develop until the second season.  Also, this is back when Assistant Director Walter Skinner was just an annoying antagonist--before he became an ally to Mulder and Scully, and the Cigarette-Smoking Man was just a dark figure hovering in the background with an ever-present cloud of smoke.  Both characters, who seemed so mediocre in the beginning, have come to play such an important part in the show.
This box set of DVDs is absolutely wonderful, and worth every penny.  It contains seven disks--six for the episodes and one for the special features.  The presentation is excellent, and the special features are satisfying enough.
This is the ultimate must-have for any X-Phile.  I also recommend Season Two, now available on DVD as well, and from what I understand, Season Three will be available in May.
Pop in a disk, sit back, and enjoy!  You're about to be swept away into a world of eerie monsters, shadowy conspiracies, elusive aliens, superb acting, and all-around great story-telling . . .",981504000,2,3243,5.142857142857143
1338834,5,B00003RQND,"Fan or not, it is hard to deny the indelible impact ""The X-Files"" has made on popular culture.  That said, this collection is outstanding.  I've been chained to my player ever since recieving this and Season 2 for Christmas.  The detail is amazing, chapters sensically divided and easily arranged on an interesting top menu.
Now two things I don't like about the set.  Number one--the rather fragile cardboard casing.  For this price, one would think you could get at least a plastic box.  Number two--extra features.  There are virtually none.  This is television, you show us some takes!  Where outtakes should be, there are clips from international versions, which while entertaining, do a poor job of filling the void where deleted scenes and extra footage should be.  Secretive to the end, I suppose :-)
Despite that, I give this box set 5 stars, primarily because I am a huge fan and will go broke buying every one of them FOX issues.  They know that I and others like me won't stop until they have the collection, no matter how many omitted scenes they omit.",979862400,2,1065,4.733695652173913

With the exception of the Pilot the quality of the resolution is extraordinary (for some reason they did not sharpen the the resolution of the pilot, probably because it was filmed rather cheaply on low grade film).  I whole heartedly recomend this set of seven DVDs for their completeness and exceptional quality. It is one of the best purchases I have made for my DVD player in the past two years.  I have since gone out and purchased the second season set.  I wish all television series were released like this.  It would allow me to throw away my VCR.",979344000,,849,4.6644295302013425
1338836,5,B00003RQND,"I purchased this set, as I have been a fan since the airing of the pilot episode. The series is extremely well thought out, and leaves a person guessing as to what will happen next. While the some may debate whether there is any truth in the subject matter contained in the episodes, this is not the appropriate forum for such a discussion.
I love owning the entire first season, and think that it would be a great addition to the DVD library of any fan of the genre. I love the interesting bonus materials included with the set, and feel that viewing the entire collection prior to seeing the movie is an very good idea, so that one can view it with some background to properly appreciate some of the subtle nuances of the movie.
I started to rewatch the season one day, and my fiance, definately not a fan of the genre, happened to sit down and watch the episodes with me. We have still not completed the first season, but she does now like the series, and does not miss the episodes on television, and considers herself a fan of the series.
I have already purchased season two, and we will watch it after she has seen the movie. We are eagerly awaiting seasons three and beyond to be released. Fellow X-philes, watching this season with your significant other will create a new fan, if they are not already fans themselves.
The only criticism that I have is that the set should have come in a sturdy box rather than a flimsy slip case. Also, inclusion of the cards as with the earlier boxed sets of tapes would have been a really nice addition. All in all this is an excellent DVD set that all fans of the Genre should own.",978739200,,1626,4.3519736842105265

I have never watched much of the X Files on television, bar a few episodes here and there - I guess it was the movie that really bought me into the fold.
So to date, I have only seen the first season in completion, and I really enjoyed it. The X Files has excellent cinamatography and the production/direction is first class. The ability to create such atmospheric scenes with movie class actors is rarely seen on TV these days.
I think the mythology epsiodes are well told, whilst not giving away too much of the conspiracy. There are some fantastic single episodes including Stretch & Tooms, Conduit, Ice, Beyond the Sea, and Darkness Falls.
Providing all of the episodes in order on the boxed set is absolutely the right thing to do. I hope more studios stand up and take notice of this.
This has been my most enjoyable DVD purchase so far, even though it is not in widescreen and doesn't have 5.1 sound. Says something about the quality of the X Files I think.",976492800,4,1173,4.46046511627907

I am only 16, and I don't have a job right now during the school year.  I was debating whether or not to buy this, but when I did, I would not take it back.  It is probably the best thing about DVD that I can think of.
Every episode from Season One is here.  I don't think you could find anything  better than this.  The discs all have different labels, though the same in style.  They are put together very well.  There are four episodes per disc.  Each epidsode has somewhere up to 15 chapters, so you can skip around if you need to.  Basically every good thing about DVD is in this set.  The picture quality is usually flawless on my Sony DVD player.  There are a few single shots that do not have good quality, but they are few.
The episodes themselves are all great.  This is the beginning of a great series.  I love everything about this boxed set of DVDs. My favorite episdoes on here have got to be Deepthroat, Ice, Gender Bender, Beyond the Sea, Young at Heart, Darkness Falls, and E.B.E.  I still have one disc left to watch, but it will definatley be as good as all the others.

1338854,5,B00003RQND,"There's something special about having a box set tucked away in your DVD collection. It's nice knowing you have every episode available to watch at any time. This set is simply superb. The entire first series of the X-Files  is spread across seven discs with a host of extras and even a couple of  DVD-ROM games for your computer.  Season One of the X-Files was probably  the best; it was a hundred times more fresh and original than some of the  trite that has been doled out in the past seasons, notable six and seven.  Every x-phile has a soft spot for Season One. It's hard to believe it is  seven years old now. These episodes were made before David Duchovny could  afford acting lessons and before the series' success forced them to dumb  down the storylines for the general viewer. If you're a serious x-phile  then you'll already own this set, but for the curious newcomer who missed  out and wants to know what all the fuss is about (where have you been?)  then this is by far the best place to start.  There is no doubt whatsoever  that the X-Files revolutionised the way TV looks and feels. This set is a  fantastic way to own 18 hours of the best television ever made. See what it  was like before everyone involved succumbed to the swinish flu of commerce.  Don't even think about complaining about the price; seven DVDs for that  price is an absolute bargain. You could never get a whole season on VHS for  that price. Picture and sound quality in this set are excellent - for those  people who have complained about it, remember that it was filmed seven  years ago on a modest budget so the picture is never going to be truly  crystal clear but it's the best you will ever see it.  So, take the plunge  and buy it. Completists beware though, you'll have to save up for the 7  subsequent box sets like me! It's worth every cent.",963792000,61,1842,4.410714285714286

Surley more thought could have  been put into this, lets hope that this is improved for subsequent  releases! But besides this small inconvenience this is a top rate dvd and  is well worth getting for anyone who enjoys the show and a valuable  addition to any dvd collection.",962928000,2,687,4.536585365853658
1338857,4,B00003RQND,"""The X-Files"" is an excellent fit for DVD---beautifully shot, a mythology deep enough to keep teenagers buying background material, and a rabid fan following noted for their penchant to purchase anything  ""X"".
Having collected several of the collector's sets on VHS,  like many I was frustrated by the lack of completeness in each release,  with a season represented by only 25% of its episodes.  While this is  acceptable for the casual fans, it proved exruciating for the true X-phile,  as invariably favorite episodes were left out of the mix.
This situation  has been rectified with the release of the entire first season of the show  on DVD in a seven-disc collection.  It is now possible to watch each  episode commercial-free and in sequence in a digital-quality medium.  In  addition, an extras disc has been added (details are listed above),  including a DVD-ROM computer game.
Having completed my viewing of the  entire 1st set, several observations came to mind: - The  ""X-Files"", almost unique in episodic television, hit the airwaves  fully-formed.  There is precious little difference in tone or execution  between the pilot and subsequent episodes.  - Whereas some of the 3rd and  4th season episodes saw a noticeable decline in quality (due to the loss of  key writers and Chris Carter's focus elsewhere), the 1st season episodes  are generally superbly-written.
Unfortunately, my cut of this  collection did suffer from noticeable editing problems.  Nothing major,  typically just a couple of misaligned frames at chapter cuts, but let's  face it--for this kind of money, it should be flawless.
Nonetheless, I  highly recommend this collection.",962755200,104,1661,5.240458015267175

So this release was a nice find on Amazon. And I'm very happy I  bought it! The packaging is beautiful - a deluxe digipak kind of affair  which folds out seven times - very nice. The sound is a bit low - just turn  up the TV / Stereo and you'll be fine. The picture quality on the discs is  perfect - great job to whoever did the transferring. As for the actual  episodes.... I'm sure you'll read more in depth reviews from long time  X-Philes fanatics, but as a novice, I like them. I don't love them - I was  suprised to find a few of the episodes are actual lifts from other sources  (""Ice"" is a nod to (if not a rip off of) ""The Thing"",  and ""Ghost In The Machine"" lifts HAL right out of 2001). But the  chemistry between Mulder & Sculley is sexually tense and the show is  overall fun and engrossing. The bonus material on the six episode discs  isn't worth seeking out, but the seventh disc, with the documentaries is  great. Overall, I am very happy. And I'm not a hardcore fan, just an  interested one.",961372800,2,1167,4.1891891891891895

Pros: Four episodes per disc with about 14  chapters per episode shows why DVD is the ideal format for distribution of  television programs. No more fast-forwarding past CC's  commentary.
Material on disc 7 is entertaining and will help fulfill the  completist compulsions that many DVD buffs have. Packaging and menus show a  lot of work and thought went into this. Both very spiffy.
Cons: You don't  get those cards they inserted in the VHS packaging ... those were cool.  Occassional artifacts; FX scenes on disc 7 look pretty bad (but who cares).",960681600,4,855,4.971830985915493

No excuse now, on DVD they take up the same amount of  space as a Tom Clancy novel, and at a price of about $100 they are a steal.  If you are an X-Files fan and don't have a DVD player yet, well here's  your excuse.  As an added bonus you get to see scenes that were cut out --  Scully had a boyfriend in the original pilot!-- and we also get a free  game!

While recent seasons have been somewhat exasperating, this incredible box set of the first season of the X Files will remind you why the show became an instant cult hit and  why, surprisingly, it attracted such a wide and diverse audience.  There's  really no need to go on about the acting.  Anderson and Duchovney's  successes in their portrayals of agents Mulder and Scully are already well  catalogued.  Though it is worth taking the time to point out the great  cinematography, directing and score that made the X Files what it is.  The  first seasons were all gorgeously shot on location in Vancouver.  The score  by Mark Snow, while subtle, is vital to the overall creepy feel to the  show.  Dark, mysterious, and suspenseful, these episodes will scare you,  intrigue you, and make you fall in love with the X Files if you haven't  already.  Watching the X Files will once again become an event, where you  unplug the phone, turn off the lights, and prepare yourself to be scared  senseless.  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.
A must for every fan,  this set will also turn casual viewers into X Files fans.  If you thought  the X Files every Sunday was great, wait until you see the first season, on  demand, on DVD.",960076800,4,1276,4.63963963963964

I'm about 2/3 through the collection and I had not previously seen any of the episodes.  It's fun  to watch the characters as they're developing - it's also great not to have  everything revolve around the UFO conspiracy thing - although there are a  few episodes which follow that line.  An excellent purchase although I'm a  little confused about the price - it's gone up $10 since I bought it.,959990400,,523,4.559139784946237

Now, with the DVD release I have watched it all again and I find that the series is as enjoyable as  ever. This time its interesting to note some of the in-jokes (eg the  appearance of the name Tom Braidwood).
Most people who will buy or want  to buy this DVD know what the series is about. For those who have some idea  but perhaps are not familiar with the earlier episodes - there are great  episodes and there are not so great episodes. As someone once said, X-Files  season one at its worst is better than most other series. I agree with this  and find that even the poorer episodes (Jersey Devil, for one) are quite  watchable.
The entire first season is split over six discs with TV spots  etc on a seventh disk. Sadly the missing scenes turn out to be two minor  scenes, both from the pilot episode and only serve to show us what might  have been ie Scully's boyfriend.
That said, the transfer is excellent and  the sound quality is magnificent. The box set is a little flimsy (mine is  already showing signs of wear and tear and that's only because I've been  watching the episodes over the period of one week)and to be honest I would  prefer the sturdy cases used for the Star Trek releases.

The cut  scenes were also interesting to watch, as were the interviews.

Minor annoyances for such a terrific DVD  set with no commercials.  At just under 45 minutes per episode, the X-Files  seems like a bunch of micro-thrillers which take not much longer to watch  than a comic book takes to read.  Unlike earlier posts, I am finding the  images sharp and the colors just fine.  This is why I bought a DVD player.  Highly recommended.",959817600,5,751,4.811023622047244

Some reviewers have commented on poor  video quality, but mine was excellent. The picture and sound quality were  perfect--a little dark on the picture sometimes, but that's just the way  the original show and commerical videos are.  It's not anything faulty in  the DVD's.
One of the benefits of having the entire first season on DVD  (in addition to the quality) is that it takes up so much less room than  videotape, you get it all at once, and it's all there in order. Plus, the  cost comes out better than buying tapes with 2 episodes each (not to  mention they didn't put them all on tape).

The  packaging is attractive and quite the spectacle when you open the entire  book and lay all seven discs before you.  However, you cannot judge a book  by it's cover, so one has to watch a few episodes.  What a treat it is to  be able to watch these creepy, intelligent shows in a crisp digital form  with no interruptions.  They could have tightened the gaps where comercials  should have gone, but that is splitting hairs.
The digital trasfer was  great!  Some complianed about being able to clearly see the digital pixals  in certain places.  I found that a decent gold s-video cable cleared that  right up and the resolution was smooth sailing, but I haven't seen all 24  episodes yet and picked them apart.
This is a set worth saving your  nickles to buy.  The value here is incredible!  At under $15.00 a disc,  each has at least three plus hours of entertainment, features etc.  etc.
Although, don't buy the set for additional interviews and behind the  scenes features.  The set has those things, but they are not very  enlightening for those who have followed this series for any length of  time.

I  usually buy my DVD's from the states, simply because my experience of UK  transfers is not a good one, however I think I'll be a little more careful  in future.

This DVD set appealed to me because I thought it would be interesting to follow the development of the show and its characters during  its first year, and because I was curious to see how a television series  would look and sound in the DVD format.
I could not be more pleased on  either count.  The program content is uniformly outstanding, thanks to  consistently fine performances by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson,  intriguing scripts, great visual effects, clever editing, and of course  Mark Snow's brilliant musical score.  There were episodes I especially  enjoyed (""Eve"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""Shapes"",  ""Tooms""), but that's simply a matter of personal taste; in fact,  each of the 24 segments offered its own distinctive pleasures.
The DVD  presentation is consistently outstanding, with sharp, crisp visuals and  clean sound.  What a pleasure to enjoy the stories without commercial  interruptions, breaking news pre-emptions, and/or annoying ""visual  noise"" like station logos or weather warnings superimposed in the  corner of the screen.

It's nice to be able to go back to ANY of the episodes -- even those I barely remember-- and watch them all again. The packaging is glorious-- a unique  fold-out design with built-in jewel cases and silkscreened images to  differentiate each disc.
On the negative side,  for those of us with  larger televisions (27-32"" screens), you may notice a good deal of  visual background mottling. It's almost as if you're looking at a series of  Quicktime movies. You can see a lot of digitized patterns--some of them are  quite visible-- that come and go in the texture of the walls and in open  backgrounds. Some people would never notice it, but if you're the type of  person that would, then be prepared--the digital transfer is lacking. The  sound is not noticeably better than the videos, but is not bad.
My only  other point would be that DVDs now allow us the extra space to view  outtakes, bloopers and documentaries. The outtakes (there are only 2 in the  set from the Pilot) are incredibly interesting, and are of great interest  to the fans. (Sorry, no spoilers.)

The price is AWESOME.  Compare that to Star Trek: The Next Generation. Where I'm from they are at  least $20 a tape...FOR ONE EPISODE.
Just to give you and idea how good  this is...well I don't even have a DVD player yet.  But you should see it.  Once you open it...folds out to an enourmous size. And like most of the  X-Files merchandise...it's got great style.
If you don't like the X-Files  but are mildly curious... BUY IT!  What?, close to 24 hours worth of  viewing for a little over 100 dollars...YAH it's worth it. If you don't  like it...auction it. But trust me, I've converted more people to X-Files  fans than you'd believe.
Enjoy your purchase.",958089600,,987,4.534090909090909
1338884,5,B00003RQND,"Well I have spent the last few days marveling at the sheer splendor of this Season 1 set. The packaging is really cool. But its whats on the inside that counts, the 7 disk set is a must have for any true X-Files fan.  I am so very happy that I can enjoy these episodes for many years to come  in DVD format. I have watched these season 1 episodes on TV countless times.  The DVD format is such that I look forward to watching all of season 1 all  over again for the first time! The audio/video quality is awsome! Disk 7,  with its bonus interviews and features, is a nice touch and adds to the  season 1 experience with interviews and promos for specific season 1  episodes. For those of you who have already consumed X-Files season 1 on TV  or VHS format rest assured that you are purchasing one of the few genuine  TV landmarks worthy of a lavish and more durable presentation. For the rest  of you, who are about to enter entirely new territory, I can only express  my extreme envy. You are about to encounter a new level of storytelling.",958089600,,1041,4.260204081632653

1338886,5,B00003RQND,I just got my X-Files Season One: Gift Pack last night and watched the first two episodes.  The picture and sound in these episodes is absolutely outstanding.  This is the way the X-Files were meant to be watched.  I just  hope they put all the seasons on DVD.  Way to go Fox!,958003200,3,276,4.230769230769231
1338887,5,B00003RQND,What a great value this is.  You get all 24 episodes from the first season.  I got mine yesterday and was really impressed with the layout and style of the case.  Having the 7th disc with the extra stuff is great and  most of the extra stuff is also included on the disc that contains that  episode.  This box set is a great addition to my dvd collection and I would  recommend it to any one interested in the series.,958003200,3,417,4.1375
1338888,5,B00003RQND,"This has to be the best deal ever in the history of DVD!  A whole season at once (24 episodes) in one purchase! As mentioned in another review, it would be great if other series like Star Trek would do the same thing.  I  am interested in buying the movies and multiple packaging is a waste of  space and resources. The packaging on this set is attractive and space  saving considering there is 7 DVD discs within.  Compare that size to  ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" box set block which takes up three  times the space!",957916800,3,518,4.322916666666667
1338889,3,B00003RQND,"First of all, let me praise Chris Carter for making a TV series affordable to own. In fact, owning this series on DVD is far less expensive than owning it on VHS, which makes you wonder why videotapes still cost so much.  Having said that, let me also say that fans of a particular TV series  usually want all the episodes since character and plot continuity are the  two biggest reasons we watched these shows in the first place. The  packaging of this set is first-rate.  However, having said that, I  must also include one big complaint. The video transfer on this set is a  big disappointment. I can clearly remember when I purchased my DVD player  in late 1998 and being blown away by the pristine detail of the resolution  that DVD produces. This set however, looks barely better than a good VHS  cassette. The picture is dark, which coincidentally, was the case everytime  I watch the show on television. The usual incredibly high resolution that  DVD should provide is not here. In fact, detail of images, especially  people's faces is a huge disappointment. Despite all my complaints about  the way the original Star Trek series is being released on DVD, as in two  episodes at a time, I invite anyone to compare the video quality of those  shows from the 1960's to these X-Files episodes. There is no comparison.  Star Trek looks brand new and almost jumps off the screen.  I would  appreciate anyone who reads this review to email me and share their opinion  on this.  All in all, an impressive set in its structure and pricing,  but when it comes to the most important factor, the picture, it leaves much  to be desired.",957830400,5,1632,4.609756097560975
1338890,5,B00003RQND,"Without X-Files there would be no Buffy.  This show gave us everything we wanted and more.
Season one is the ultimate purchess, so you can watch them all over and over without wearing them out, also you can go straight  to your favorate episodes without fast forwarding entire episodes.
The  only snag is it comes in a flimsy cardboard cover that could easly get  damaged when taking the dvds out and putting them back in again. And there  are only 2 deleted scenes, and a dodgy special effects snippit that looks  like it was just thrown in as a second thought.
Other than that it's a  welcome edition to the DVD world, we should hope that Star Trek: TOS, TNG,  DS9, and VOY, all come out in box sets, as well as The Simpsons, Buffy,  Angel, the classic and the updated Twilight Zone, (IN THEIR ORIGINAL  EPISODE LINE UP, AND NOT THE HALF ASSED ATTEMPT THAT THEY'VE RELEASED NOW,  AND IS THE REASON I REFUSE THEM ON DVD).
Buy the X-Files Box Set, and  lets hope they'll release all the rest of the six seasons by the end of the  year.  (okay so it may put a strain on your pocket, but hey it's the  X-files! )",957830400,57,1110,4.294685990338165
1338891,5,B00003RQND,"This has got to be one of the highlights of DVD ever since its introduction.  To think that now one can own the entire first season plus see all the extras that come with the territory.  True this volume of work  will has not yet been released,still you can base your opinion solely on  the merit of the episodes it contains.  If you do not know the story of  the X-Files than you must have been in a coma for the past seven years.  The whole saga revolves around FBI agents Fox Mulder(David Duchovney) and  Dana Scully(Gillian Anderson), who investigate strange and paranormal  happenings.  The chance that this DVD collection gives you is to see how it  all began and to see how the characters where established.  It is in this  season that we are introduced to Deep Throat, who is a anonymous informant  who seems to to help Mulder and yet is always looking out for himself.  In  the episode ""Tooms"" we first meet Walter Skinner.  He is assigned  to keep an eye on both the agents by those above him yet he is soon  embroiled in their conspiracies.  Finally there is the ever present  Cigarrete Smoking Man whom seems to be involved in everything and yet has  truly unlimited power and influence.  Another thing that one benfits form  this collection is that there are the extras like cast and crew interviews,  deleted scenes that never made it to the final print, and interviews with  Chris Carter on how where it all came from.  Every X-Files fan should have  this volume of work in their collection.  I just hope that the other  seasons will soon be released!",957398400,,1566,4.528776978417266
1338892,5,B00003RQND,"Now for those Philes out there with the show maybe going off the air, this will be our mainstay. It was a dream come true to find out that I would no longer have to search through tape after tape to find my favorite eps, but  that I could turn to a boxed set. The more I hear about all the special  feature the more I fall in love. It was a great idea of FHE to release  every ep season by season. I can't wait!",957312000,,411,3.755813953488372
1338893,5,B00003RQND,"When I got a DVD player for Christmas in 1998, the stream ofvideotapes to my house virtually stopped coming in (except blank onesfor videotaping).  I was thinking early on how it would be great if they released my favorite TV show (next to ""Friends"") on DVD: ""THE X-FILES""!  I think Fox already started releasing that horrid show ""Ally McBeal"" on videotape format?  Well, anyway, the same company made a good decision to release the first season on DVD.  I have to admit -- I've seen only a few of the first season shows since I watched some of the repeats and videotapes at random houses.  With every 1st season episode on DVD, with no worries of ""tape-wear"" or commercials, and including interviews, trailers, great sound, etc. etc. make for a great viewing experience! . . . I hope they continue this trend for seasons 2 (and eventually) thru 7 -- maybe beyond.  If you are a fan, preorder now because it's only another week away!",957139200,,933,4.624242424242424
1338894,5,B00003RQND,"Now THIS is truly the way to watch the X-Files, on DVD with the clearest of picture quality and all of the first season episodes present. You'll get no commercial interruptions, no staticy pictures and no on screen distractions, just the best quality episodes you can get. Okay, so some of  the stories are a bit campy, and certain elements that were found in later  seasons aren't present in the first season, but don't forget they were  still setting up the groundwork. For those who may have missed a few  episodes that weren't coveredin the video tape run, this is an excellent  way to get all of those missing first season episodes. For those who were  in a cave, or were avoiding the series early on, again this is a good way  to get these into your collection.

The ultimate in pleasure for all true X-phile that cannot be put down in words. The  complete Season One on DVD is what a X-phile would want and should have.  Personally, I have been waiting for this piece of news for about three  years. Glad it's finally happening. Can't wait for the X-Files Season One  DVD collection to fill my Audio/Video library.

1338896,5,B00003RQND,"The DVD still hasn't come out yet, so it's obvious that my 5-star rating is premised solely on the merits of the episodes contained therein (as viewed from TV broadcast, VHS and LaserDisc).
What can I say?  I count myself one among the multitudes of X-philes out there.  The series itself  may be considered the ""thinking man's"" sci-fi, posing  thought-provoking questions on the various quantity  X's/""unknowns"" out there.
The Pilot has Agents Mulder and  Scully team up for the first time to investigate the mysterious deaths of  high school classmates, while Episode 2 introduces Deep Throat and focuses  on the (not so surprisingly) unusual disappearances involving US army test  pilots.  3 introduces mutant killer Eugene Tooms.  4 involves a teenaged  girl's abduction by aliens.  5 takes off from the Jersey Devil urban myth.  6 is a ""revenge-beyond-the-grave"" story of sorts.  7 is on a  computer gone berserk.  8 is an entertaining rip-off of ""The  Thing""/""Who Goes There?"".  9 recalls a theme similar to the  recent (and unbelievably boring) ""Astronaut's Wife"".  10  introduces UFO abductee Max Fenig.  11 pays homage to ""Boys From  Brazil"".  12 reminded me of Drew Barrymore in ""Firestarter"".  13 is about a convict who has psychic abilities.  14 shows a series of  bizarre murders committed by a person who can change gender (spoiler  warning: he's an alien!).  15 is about a bank robber taking over the body  of an FBI agent (Scully's ex) immediately after both are shot to death  simultaneously.  16 has one of Mulder's enemies return from (what was  thought to have been) the dead.  17 has a UFO shot by the Iraquis  transferred to US custody.  18 introduces a young faith healer who appears  to have genuine powers.  19 is a classic werewolf story.  20 is about  disappearing loggers and killer mites.  21 reintroduces Tooms. 22 is about  a girl with psychokinetic abilities and who appears to be the reincarnation  of a murdered policeman.  23 is about the psychic bond between a janitor  and (the preserved head of) his twin.  24 (gee, I think I got my numbers  wrong...well anyway...) has the agents discovering gov't testing of alien  DNA on an unknowing populace.

I really have to laugh at the people who give it negative reviews.  This is a VERY complex and cerebral show, especially as the seasons progress.  The story arc is arguably the most complex ever attempted by a television drama. People who dislike it simply don't possess the intellect or the attention span to appreciate it.  And to those complaining that the acting is ""wooden"": it's a little concept known as ""low-key"".
