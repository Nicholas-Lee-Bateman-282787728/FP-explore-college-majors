8194831,4,6304725043,"This is an ""early"" Jackie Chan film (known at the time as ""Jacky Chan""), circa 1980.  This was long before the slapstick and buffoonery of his later films.  The fighting is excellent and spectacular.  The plot is not the typical worn-trodden ""you killed my master"" fare, and carries a mystery throughout the film until the very end.  The film drags in the middle, but picks up briskly in the final reel.  I would have liked to have seen Jackie Chan use the snake and crane technique a little more than essentially only at the end. Nevertheless, this is a nice addition to your collection.",971481600,,588,4.615384615384615

8194833,5,6304725043,"while I agree with the previous reviewer that fearless hyena is also excellent, this is also a top-notch kung fu film, and defintely not ""painful"". maybe he saw ""snake fist fighter"" and got  the two mixed up. fans of Jackie's kung-fu comedy style may not like this  as much as some others, this is a classic formula kung fu film. the  super-secret kung fu style contained in a much coveted book, the powerful  villain with stereotypically dressed henchmen, bad dubbing...it's all here.  one of the few Chan movies where he's an extremely skilled fighter from the  start of the film, and a wisecracking one to boot. however, one of the  female co-stars must be related to the producer...by the time she dies  you'll be cheering the villain. this movie also received a few votes in a  ""best Jackie movie ever"" poll of the jackie chan fan club mailing  list.",916099200,7,855,4.677852348993288
