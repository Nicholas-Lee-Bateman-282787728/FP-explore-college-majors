8440560,4,B004T8J5HS,"In this video, we are introduced to a new Barnaby, who is part psychologist. The prior Barnaby's cousin. DS Ben Jones introduces him around town, and he seems determined to show Barnaby that he is able to solve crimes. In fact, he tells him how he solved a crime in the past. He interpreted a forty year old death - a man found in a barn - as a suicide. Barnaby seems to disagree. Probably because he is new to the town or because he has a sense of humor - telling people at the local pub that he got the job by sleeping with his superiors - he lets ben take the lead in another murder investigation. There are twists and turns and many red herrings, but then the case is solved by Barnaby, who uses, as he says, common sense.",1465430400,,726,4.119718309859155
