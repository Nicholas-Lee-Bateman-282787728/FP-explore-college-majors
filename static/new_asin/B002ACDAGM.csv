8359209,3,B002ACDAGM,"As someone that grew up with the teen angst movies, I was disappointed. It begins as your typical 'last summer as teens' movie. The love triangles lack chemistry & the plot barely comes to a head. What would you do in the same predicament? The ending ties it up nicely & you understand why they choose the solution they did. I watched the whole thing for many reasons, one to find out the big 'secret'. Sadly, I was bored. It felt superficial and lacked depth to the characters. There were so many ways to flesh out the characters & get the viewer more involved but it seems they went for the least they could do. I was left wanting more but ultimately unsatisfied.",1284336000,,665,4.414634146341464
8359210,1,B002ACDAGM,"Just finished watching this.  Very disappointed.  Waste of time.  Sometimes you feel like it's more a music video than a movie. The story is severely lagging.  Characters are not developed very well at all.  The actors did a good job though.  Some very good talent in some of them.  It dabbles some into philosophy, evolution and also some comments seem out of nowhere, as in, older teenagers do not talk in such a way.  Avoid this movie.",1257465600,4,438,4.597402597402597
8359211,4,B002ACDAGM,"While this was screening, inevitable comparisons to loads of other teen-twentysomething dramas/tv shows filtered through, reminiscent of The Hills, Melrose, OC, etc. The exception here is you get an R rating and only 85 minutes to cram in the eight characters and their personal drama.

The story follows a group of teens having one last party before college at a Florida beach house. We get the usual spattering of drinking, drugs, drama talk, good looking naked girls, and more drama all spliced in with some foreshadowing of a bad occurrence upon them. The story definitely drags in many areas, but it will appeal to those that want that indie feeling mesh of watching these twenty and thirty-somethings talk and party on the beach (whilst having a soundtrack CONSTANTLY playing representing some indie/modern rock that inevitably drowns out some of the scenes).

The video quality is solid and the sound is adequate but what gives this 2.5 star film the extra rating are the supplements.

* The director commentary is done as a Q&A from high school students to him as they watch the film. Have not seen too many ones like this, it is catered towards the film-making students in how he made this film.
* Writer and producer commentary, a dialogue on making a passion piece and the time it takes for these things to come to fruition.
* 17:20 minute making of. A thorough depiction of what it took for them to make this film.
* 5:30 minute slide show. Some decent pics of the location for filming shown to a mix of music similar to what was in the film.
* Music video of one song from the film.

This compilation is spread over two discs and is encoded ALL region. Tough to say either way about recommending a watch or not, so I would have to summarize by saying be in the mood for this style, and if you are a fan of the other series I mentioned but want better writing - here you go.",1255132800,5,1886,4.538235294117647
