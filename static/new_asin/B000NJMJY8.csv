8178421,5,B000NJMJY8,"Children can watch a video over and over, making the parents crazy.
But this video is so well done, parents enjoy hearing it, and especially would
enjoy the Christian behavior being taught.",1369440000,,189,4.9375
8178422,5,B000NJMJY8,"We bought this for our two year old daughter, although it is captivating for the four year old and barely two year old that I care for during the day as well.  The episodes are brief and hold the short attention span of our daughter and definitely the four year old, who wants to watch them over and over again.  We will be ordering the full volumes of these excellently produced DVDs.  It is wonderful to hear the messages from Max Lucado addressed to the children as well.  Affordable and worth much more than a Disney movie in our home!",1320624000,,539,4.36
