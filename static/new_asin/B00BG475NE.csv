8568012,4,B00BG475NE,"I was expecting a documentary about beauty pageants in India, and boy did I get more than I expected.  As someone who is not overly familiar with Indian culture, this documentary really touched on a ton of areas and challenges that Indian women are facing.

One of the contestants, Ruhi, was very clear that she was not competing in the pageant for the experience.  Winning was the only thing that mattered.  She saw it as one of the few options available for Indian women to take advantage of the same opportunities for success, money, etc. that men have.  There was a huge difference implied between the parents of the beauty pageant girls and the camp girls.  The parents of the girls in the pageant valued their daughters, and wanted them to be happy and successful.  The pageant was really seen as a euphemism for people on both sides for change to Indian culture.  The parents and girls of the pageant embraced change, and were excited by where they see the culture heading.  The young lady that won the pageant actually stated as part of the competition that their mothers could learn from them to not give up their dreams, and they could accomplish more than had been possible in the past.

On the flip side, the father of the camp leader, Prachi, seemed to find little value in his daughter.  He made it clear that he did not care what she thought or wanted, she would do certain things as they were her duty.  One of the most fascinating scenes in this documentary was when Prachi was asked about being angry with her father.  She acknowledged it, but then blew it off because ""he knew I was a girl, and he still let me live.""  I wonder if Prachi would have been a lesbian in another culture.  She was adamant that she did not want to be married or have children (although her father vowed she WOULD do both).  She said that she is not like other girls, and was raised like a boy and girl and does not fit in with either.  She mentioned just wanting to be ""how she is"" several times throughout the documentary, and I would have liked a little more insight into what that meant to her.  No doubt that she absolutely did not want to live the life prescribed for her by the lifestyle she was fighting so hard to protect.

It is sad for me as a Westerner to know that there are women who feel like beauty pageants are one of the best ways to fulfill their potential given constraints in their society.  The scenes at the camp were just disturbing, and I found little about ""the movement"" redeeming.  The camps have been likened to terrorist training, and these young girls were being taught that they should be willing to resort to violence to protect their superior way of life.  They were being taught intolerance of Christians, Muslims, and Westerners, and also that they have no options in life outside of a predetermined role.  It's great that they felt powerful and strong while attending the camp, but ultimately, it just seemed like brain washing with a side of military training.

I agree with the reviewer that would have liked to have seen some perspectives in the middle just to balance it out.",1400198400,,3112,4.516071428571428
8568013,4,B00BG475NE,"""The World Before Her"" (2012 release from India; 90 min.) is a documentary focusing on two young women in India who are finding their way in life. As the movie opens, we get to meet Ruhi, a 19 yr. old who is in the final group of 20 women competing for the title of Miss India 2011. She is just starting a beauty contest boot camp that will run for 30 days leading up to the pageant itself. Next we get to meet Prachi, a 24 yr. old who is a camp leader at Durga Vahini, a Hindu nationalistic training camp for women between the ages of 15 and 23. We also get to know the respective families.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, kudos to director Nisha Pahuja for bringing us these insights into Indian society, it was an eye-opener for me (I've never been in to India). Second, beware, the documentary contains some disturbing footage of Hindu extremists brutally attacking women for the heinous crime of being seen with a man, or for being in a bar, or for simply being a woman. There is also some fairly shocking footage of the beauty pageant contestants getting botox injections and skin whitening treatments. Third, one can only imagine the pressure that weighs on girls and women in India. At one point Ruhi's mother describes how disappointed and let down she felt when giving birth and being told it was another girl, as in Indian society girls and women are third rate at best (behind men and cows, really). We should all be thankful for living in a country like the US where, compared to India, women are treated and live like queens.

I saw this movie at the 2014 International Women's Day festival held by the Cincinnati World Cinema, and the screening was PACKED I am happy to report. ""The World Before Her"" raises a lot of poignant questions, and is worth checking out, be it in the theater, on DVD or on Amazon Instant Video. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394323200,,1864,4.495575221238938
8568014,4,B00BG475NE,"The 2012 documentary THE WORLD BEFORE HER covers two groups of women living what, at first, seems to be very different lives in the country of India.  Females aged 12 to 25 attend a Hindu Nationalist training camp where they prepare for combat against invading forces and are taught to hate westerners, Muslims, and Christians.  The other group comprises beauty pageant contestants vying for the title of Miss India.  The young Hindu women learn they must marry and have children.  The Miss India hopefuls see the exposure the contest provides as their best bet to move on to bigger and better things, which, I guess, leaves the young women of India not good-looking enough, at least by conventional standards, with less opportunity?

I'd like it if THE WORLD BEFORE HER caught up with Indian women who are part of neither group, but what his film offers is more than compelling enough viewing.  While the Hindu Nationalist trainees and Miss India contestants have nothing in common on the surface, all are on track to a life centered on pleasing men.",1384473600,4,1051,4.843575418994414
