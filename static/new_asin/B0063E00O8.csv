4935295,5,B0063E00O8,Love this movie! It was funny and random. Edward Furlong  did a great performance on all characters. It kept me laughing through the whole thing.,1365033600,,145,4.8
4935296,2,B0063E00O8,"I really should have listened to the little voice in my head - the one that warned me that even though I like Edward Furlong as an actor, I wouldn't like this movie.

I've always been taught to never judge a book by it's cover, but the mess that is the cover of this DVD really does convey the mess that is this film.

While I normally love it when my favorite actors get 99.9% of screen time, I found myself annoyed with Furlong's characters before the halfway mark. Regular Furlong was trying to be introspective, but it just didn't work. Cowboy hat Furlong was trying to be an annoying prick and it did work. I have no clue what Reggae Furlong was trying to be, but I found that character laughable. I didn't care about any of them nor did I feel compelled to find out more about their story. When this happens, what's the point in even watching a film? At the end, I really didn't even know what the point of the film was. Maybe I'm too simple to understand it?

I found myself wanting to laugh at parts where I'm sure the writer wasn't aiming for comedy. Not even Slash's awesome guitar work could help the film, though it certainly wasn't one of the many components that hurt it.

I'd love to say I was disappointed, but that would be admitting I had high hopes for the film before even viewing it. This isn't the case. Most of the time, for me, I will normally break and say I liked a movie just because a favorite actor is in it. I can't even do that here!

Furlong fans, don't bother with this one. For most of you, you'll cringe just as badly as when you first heard his singing via the magic of YouTube. You don't need to do that to yourself again.",1359072000,,1659,4.220820189274448
4935297,1,B0063E00O8,"Horrible. Confusing. Not even to be considered ""artsy "". The only good parts were Slash's music and a deleted scene.  Very disappointed because I love Edward Furlong. It's the biggest waste of time since ""Drive "".",1339977600,,213,4.916666666666667
4935298,1,B0063E00O8,"This movie SUCKS big time!
Boring and repetitive as hell, has nice music but that's all.
You have been warned.",1338249600,,110,4.55
4935299,5,B0063E00O8,"This movie breaks every convention of traditional story telling, and by doing so, creates something unique; a philosophical dialogue steaped in dark satire that holds your interest to the very end.

This movie is also funny as hell (in places litteraly), and still manages to say something profoundly true, (pay attention--it happens so fast that if you blink, you'll miss it!).

Be ready for a 'down the rabit hole' trip to the center of the human psyche, and proof that even 'thinking men' can have belly laughfs!",1332547200,11,515,4.908045977011494
8491878,5,B0063E00O8,"I love this movie! I can watch it over and over. Why? There are very few films in this category of really creating the feeling that you are in this place with the characters. Sure, the writing is straight out of a high school philosophy class' conspiracy theorists, religious or otherwise. The story doesn't really matter. This is thoroughly entertaining and diverse in its execution. Acting is actually quite good, but many will probably think less of it because of the goofy dialogue.",1452816000,,486,4.867469879518072
8491879,5,B0063E00O8,"The title should explain it all, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE. Dont be fooled into viewing this expecting a plot to unfold with characters developing. Dont watch this unless you're willing to really engage your mind and search for meaning.  Then, if you feel inspired, find ways of applying it out in the real world. I liked how a scene from the film The Holy Mountain was slipped into this film. They make a great comparison. If you enjoyed Jodorowskys works you may enjoy this one too.",1452038400,2,478,4.494252873563219
8491880,5,B0063E00O8,"This Is Not A Movie, is boring, pretentious, slow-moving, nonsensical, pointless, and fails to deliver. I loved every minute of it. You will hate it.",1441152000,,149,5.0
8491881,1,B0063E00O8,"Furlong finishes out of the running in this fiasco of a ilm without meaning, purpose or direction!  BUMMMMMMMMEEEERRRRR!",1436313600,,120,5.666666666666667
8491882,1,B0063E00O8,"I could only watch a very little bit of the movie, it was utterly boring and stupid.",1428278400,,84,4.0
8491883,2,B0063E00O8,Really bad...watched about 5 minutes of it.,1418083200,,43,5.285714285714286

8491885,1,B0063E00O8,should be 0 stars.,1407888000,,18,3.75
8491886,5,B0063E00O8,"Don't let the IMDb rating scare you off. This film takes alot of chances but always entertains. If you watch this film and fail to laugh at the fake trailers through out, there is something wrong with you.  Also, the soundtrack was done by SLASH, so that in itself should make you want to own it.  This one has a special place in my collection.",1397520000,,344,4.276923076923077
8491887,2,B0063E00O8,"Having ""crazy"" myself, I liked the idea of this film, but couldn't get past the 15 minute mark. The plot and characters were a bit too abstract for me.",1376352000,,151,4.241379310344827
