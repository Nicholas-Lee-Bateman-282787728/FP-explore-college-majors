8185255,5,B000OIOZNQ,"This is a fantastic set of learn to knit dvds.  I knit each project and by the time I was done I was an accomplished knitter.  They are not meant to be the end all of knitting instructions.  Instead, the first one starts out showing a non-knitter how to knit.  The rest are geared toward the newbie knitter.  An advanced knitter might do things a bit differently, but Tracie teaches things the simplest way possible.  Thank you, Tracie!",1412294400,,436,4.5256410256410255

I didn't have any reviews to go by when I bought this, and I wish I'd waited, but then that would have been someone else's tough luck.

I ordered the set of 5 videos and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!

First, each DVD contains MAYBE one hour of instruction, so these could have all been put on one video & been a much better deal.
Secondly, altho the teaching is fair, this doesn't teach anything you couldn't learn yourself from a product called ""I Taught Myself How to Knit!"", which comes with needles & the basic necessities you need to start knitting.
The Fair Isle DVD doesn't actually teach you two-handed Fair Isle color knitting, which is what I really wanted to learn. It teaches you how to knit right-handed with two colors, laying one down & picking the other up - THIS IS NOT 2-HANDED KNITTING!

All in all, I'm very disappointed in the set of DVDs; I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, unless you find a used set of all 5 DVDs (probably mine!), here or at a garage sale; and I wouldn't recommend you spend more than $5 for all of them.",1236211200,,1124,4.317535545023697
