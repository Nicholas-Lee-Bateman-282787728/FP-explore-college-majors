204688,5,193834037X,A must see documentary whatever your age. These film makers did an incredible job as well a public service. You'll never see this on main stream media nor discussed. Bravo to the activists and their courage. Afterwards I also purchased DVD for my ADULT kids. Knowledge is power and these rivers affect all of us.,1417132800,5,312,4.6909090909090905

204690,3,193834037X,"It's pure propaganda regarding those interests in getting rid of our nation's dams.  I am in favor of flood control as well as salmon (and other sea life) but the presentation is too far left for me.
If these people want to act - and film - action against dams their action would be more meaningful if the y focused on the Three Gorges Dam.",1464652800,,340,4.230769230769231
204691,2,193834037X,"This piece features some awesome footage, and raises some good arguments against dams.  However they completely dismiss the merit of hydroelectric power, water supplies, and irrigation.  While it is true that some of the older, smaller hydro dams are obsolete by today's standards, many hydro dams play an essential (not to mention clean and renewable) role.  While it was dumb to build cities in the desert in the first place, many dams are now essential for municipal water supplies and agricultural irrigation, and removing them means life-changing consequences for a lot (A LOT) of people.  Saying that locks for water navigation are unnecessary because a single train track runs close to the river is just plain ignorant.

I really enjoyed the visuals of this piece, but found it difficult to take the narration seriously.  They need to present the benefits of certain dams and the extended consequences of removing them, and let the audience decide for themselves what the best option is.  The blanket ""all dams are evil, tear them all down"" message presented in this piece is laughable, and ruins the credibility of the piece for me.",1464566400,2,1140,5.031914893617022

204702,4,193834037X,"Damnation 2014 Patagonia Inc  DVD  Not Rated

This independent film is about the nations system of dams and as the title would suggest, it was produced by virulently anti-dam environmentalists.  Even they agree that it would not be reasonable to eliminate all of our dams, but they make a case that many of them could be eliminated with benefits both to the economy and to the environment.
They use several dams in the West and the Northwest as prime examples.  Benefits touted for the dams include hydroelectric power, transportation, recreation and flood control.  However some of these dams generate such negligible supply of electricity that they might be replaced largely by 3 or 4 windmills.  Recreational use is nonexistent because the Bureau of Reclamation won't permit canoes, kiyaks and other non-motorized vehicles to use the waterway despite statutory language citing that as one use of the water.  Flood control for some of the dams is also negligible either because of multiple other dams on the same river, or they are in wilderness where floods would not endanger life or property.  On the other hand, they have greatly reduced or eliminated salmon and trout runs, which used to be an important local economic activity.
There are many really beautiful landcape shots in the movie, interspersed with self-congratulations by radical environmentalists painting messages on the dams and organizing movements to deactivate them.  Sadly although the movie produced some wonderful nature scenes, they didn't spend the money to add subtitles.  Lastly some of the music is excellent.  At 87 minutes, its fairly short.  I give it an overall B.  Its not exactly a balanced look at the dam system but it did provide more information than I had before.",1448496000,2,1755,5.090909090909091
204703,5,193834037X,Good documentary...makes you really think about and question Dam projects!  Being a fisherman its a no-brainer that many should come down and thanks to this movie anyone can watch and understand the issues.,1446940800,,206,5.242424242424242

204705,4,193834037X,"Good documentary but not overwhelmingly convincing that removing dams will benefit our ecosystem greatly. The producers have an agenda that is very readily apparent.

204712,4,193834037X,Well-done documentary that sheds much light on the insane amount of dams in our country and how the federal government often views most of us taxpayers.  I would have given it five stars if it weren't for the unnecessary swearing in some parts.  Would like to be able to show the video to younger audiences otherwise.,1440028800,,317,4.642857142857143

I'm from Lewiston Idaho and it was very nice to see Lewiston mentioned. when I was a small boy I saw the rapids in Lewiston and now the slack water is there. it's good for recreation but I wish the rapids were still there.  I really like the  breaching of the Dams in slow motion and the graffiti on the Dams

204719,5,193834037X,"I must recommend the documentary movie ""DamNation"", about restoring rivers by removing obsolete dams. If you won't watch because you are pro-dam (or someone you know is) you (or they) should watch the last 30 minutes, starting a 1:10 (70 minutes in). It's on Netflix and Amazon (free on Prime).

It is well edited and does it's best to provide both sides of the story, even though you know which side they are on.

204733,5,193834037X,"There may well have been a time in the history of energy production in this country when some of the great hydro-dams, that were hailed as engineering wonders, served worthwhile purposes; but the destruction and havoc they wrecked on the environment and usually voiceless communities that lay in the path of their construction have always made them controversial even in the face of their claimed benefits. DamNation explores the history and evolution of this era and offers a eulogy to its passing through a well-researched and timely story that focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on the largest removal to date, Washington's Elwah Dam and the restoration of the Elwah River watershed. Insights by folks like David Montgomery and David James Duncan, offer a scholarly perspective to the significance of dam removal in general, and the hope for a better future from what lies beyond.",1430438400,,888,5.173611111111111

The closest this group comes to ""ecoterrorism"" is some stunning and physically dangerous graffiti.  The undamming has begun, and the now more natural rivers that have been chosen for this are open to migratory fish and the rest of the food chain.  This is wonderful for our food supply (salmon is particularly yummy) and for our natural world.

The documentary talks alot about fish runs, but perhaps there is much more to consider, some aspects of which are highlighted in the documentary.
