Arrived quickly, even though I used free normal shipping.",1388793600,,272,4.489795918367347

5927106,5,B00ELAVFBI,"This review is from: Raanjhanaa (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (Audio CD)
Raanjhanaa is the story about a man's obsessive quest for the woman he has been in love with since he was a little boy. An obsession that is futile, romantic, satisfying, dangerous and painful. The portrayal of this drama could have been annoying but Dhanush, in his Hindi film debut elevates to an almost lyrical quality and stands tall as all eyes are on a performance that could safely be judged as one of the most outstanding Hindi film debut in recent times...I was awestruck.

Some of the audience may be receptive to his pursuit but some of them have felt that this unrequited love story might portray women harshly . In all fairness sometimes life does imitate art but so does art. Watch the movie for what it is...and I can safely say that most of us would not be inclined to engage in such a pursuit.

Anand L Rai gave us a sampler of Kanpur in Tanu Weds Manu ( Average film, outstanding music) this time he give us a vista of Benaras in all its holy colorful glory before concluding in Delhi. Rai manages to also garnish the film with many interesting characters such as Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub as Murari, Kundan's friend. These are not mere fillers but have meaty sized roles. Anand L Rai shows promise and growth and I will be looking forward to his next venture.

Narrated in flashback, Kundan( Dhanush) fall in love with Zoya ( Sonam Kapoor) as a child and remains doggedly in love as a teenager. Zoya, initially hesitant because of the Hindu-Muslim difference, eventually gives in to his charms as well,but is sent away for higher studies. Kundan waits for her return. However when she returns, she has not only forgotten about him but has also fallen in love with a rising political candidate Akram ( Abhay Deol). Menawhile Bindiya ( Swara Bhaskara) loves Kundan as well. There is a lot of humor in Kundans pursuit of Zoya, a moment to watch is his breaking in to gig to Coolie's Hum Ka Issaq hua hain yaaron or his lively mannerisms in the parody of Saame Ne Yeh Kaun Aaya.

However shifting lanes is the underlying theme as one individual grows out of childhood love while the other one becomes dangerously obsessive and a doomsday.

Abhay Deol as Akram manages to keep a balance and exude a dull sheen in the radiance of Dhanush's blinding act. He does not suffer from the Shashi Kapoor or the Sunny Deol moment in Deewar and Darr.

Sonam Kapoor looks radiant, with her quiet elegance and some good acting( Is this a breakthrough moment for her?)

But I gush for Dhanush and AR Rahman. After a mediocre Jab Tak Hain Jaan, Rahman comes back firing on all cylinders - almost. This is not his finest moment but songs like Tum Tak, Banarasiya stay with you and a reason to buy the album ( I did)

If Rahman presents a great soundtrack, then Dhanush can be the loud boom that accompanies it with an explosion on screen. His Hindi is still in the infantile stages but his acting sets the movie on fire.

I did not quite enjoy the second half because the political undertones and the penance track was not as engaging. The final moments were unexpected but made up for the somewhat weak half.

Raanjhanaa is not flawless but a genuinely satisfying experience. A weak second half prevents it from becoming a classic but an arrow called Dhanush pierces your armor to make you appreciate the film. Four stars. 7/3/2013",1378166400,6,3406,4.587171052631579
8606589,3,B00ELAVFBI,"Raanjhanaa isn't a love story. It has no relation to the odds which can be overcome by true love and devotion. Raanjhanaa is a story that follows an obsessive stalker, who sees himself as the Hero, and it shows the way his selfishness slowly poisons all those around him. With this perspective, the ending is not only very appropriate, but a great relief, and just about brilliant.

Moving past the plot to the component parts of this movie, it stands up pretty well on every count. Great casting with solid performances. At more than one point in my first viewing I wondered why Sonam seemed so wooden-- and then I realized there was a narrative reason for it.

Visuals are nice. Cinematography is great. But it's the music that steals the show every time. This is Rahman at his best. The songs are transcendent, and the entire reason I'm buying the film.",1457049600,,856,4.625

8606591,3,B00ELAVFBI,"Another Indian film that seems to be a work of two halves.  Great before the interval, completely different afterward, with a strange resolution.  I'm genuinely torn on this film, because it is undoubtedly beautiful, featuring a wonderful portrait of the city of Banaras and earnest performances.  Dhanush is riveting as the anti(?)-hero Kundan, who has a lifelong unrequited love with the soulfully beautiful Zoya (Sonam Kapoor in a wonderful performance of her own).

He's Hindu, she's Muslim, so their romance would never work according to Zoya, until she finally gives in and briefly returns Kundan's affections when his dogged persistence pays off.  After her family finds out, though, she is sent away to study.  When she returns after 8 years, Kundan -- presumably because he's seen too many movies -- still holds a torch for her.  After finally remembering him from their youth, she friendzones Kundan, who mistakes her gestures for yet another chance at love...until she reveals that she met a boyfriend in college.  But our erstwhile hero still decides to be devoted to her, and help her find happiness...or so he tells himself.  At this point, the film realistically shows how unrequited love scenarios actually happen in real life instead of movieland, with people hurting each other.  After Zoya's boyfriend meets with an unexpected demise due in part to Kundan's jealousy, you're not sure where this is going.

After the interval, the tone changes completely.  We leave Banaras and head to Delhi, where the storyline becomes political, and Zoya and Kundan are still connected by a toxic mixture of devotion and guilt.  Kundan finds his fate inextricably linked to Zoya's involvement in politics and the death of her boyfriend, and Zoya finds it difficult to forgive and forget.

On the one hand, it is a fascinating story to watch unfold.  These two characters obviously have a strong bond that runs the gamut from fun & playful to toxic.  Kundan's love for Zoya determines his life path, as he goes from small town jokester and handyman to budding ""man of the people.""  Dhanush's performance shows this evolution perfectly.  Such is the strength of Sonam Kapoor's turn as Zoya that we're never quite sure what's going on in her head, as Kundan keeps showing up in her life, and as she blames him for her own personal tragedy, but still doesn't quite hate him.  And we never quite hate her, because she exhibits a quiet strength and beauty throughout.  I just find myself wishing that the film wasn't so divergent in tone.  You're not sure whether to root for the couple, and the political slant in the film's second half is so radically different from its first half.

The colors and life of Banaras are portrayed in a beautiful and lively manner, the music is nice, the direction is crisp, and the central conflict is realistic in terms of what happens when an unrequited love goes on too long.  It's better in the end to just let go, but sometimes you just can't.  And despite the best intentions, the parties begin to use one another and the seeds of resentment are sown.  It's a topical message, just not an enjoyable one.  Bollywood is more enjoyable with happy endings.",1433808000,,3190,4.882899628252788
8606592,1,B00ELAVFBI,"I'm not a fan of dying/suicide because of unrequited love.  Death is easy & weak...living takes courage & strength! Besides, I never liked either of the main characters throughout the entire movie, so didn't care what happened to them. This is probably the only Bollywood movie I won't be re-watching or keeping!",1431734400,,312,5.0

8606595,3,B00ELAVFBI,"The energy of this movie is unbelievable. If the movie was really shot in Varanasi, flavor of the city comes through. Liked the South Indian actor Dhanush in his first Hindi movie.",1405468800,,180,4.65625
8606596,3,B00ELAVFBI,"I was excited to finally see this movie, since I'd been listening to the soundtrack for some time.

The story itself was great until about 45 minutes from the end, & the ending itself was such a huge disappointment. I'll probably watch it again, just for the music, but for me this was like Romeo and Juliet gone wrong.",1394409600,,319,4.406779661016949
8606597,4,B00ELAVFBI,"Pros
1. Engaging lead actors with fully developed characters.
2. A boy loving a girl without limits, without pride, and enough to dance and sing in the streets (yes, I know a staple of Bollywood!)
3. The cliches are turned on their head and you find yourself open-mouthed completely unsure of where this is going.
2. Beautiful everything-the Ganges river, the people, the costumes, the colors...
4. Music that makes an immediate emotional impact
5. Dhanush, the lead actor, is a force onscreen and completely capable of making you love or hate him.

Cons
1. I come to Bollywood for my happy ending. This is supposed to be Disney for grown ups, but this was not.
2. The political stuff is a drag. And I think it was supposed provide more dimension to the film to make this more than a love story, but it felt very unnecessary. Kanund's love for Zoya was PLENTY enough story.
3. The ending again.... I couldn't even cry. I can deal with tragic stories that give me a good cry, but this was too much. Too much, I say!!

So, I've given you fair warning. Happy Watching!",1393718400,2,1065,4.512953367875648
8606598,3,B00ELAVFBI,"+++ beautiful cinematography throughout the movie; pleasing production design
+++ lots of outdoor scenes, for instance in Varanasi lanes
+++ the numerous songs gel well with the story-telling
+++ Sonam Kapoor acts surprisingly well as Zoya; she never was a soft, sensuous screen goddess, and that suits her role
+++ Abhay Deol convinces as the ebullient student and political leader; for once he's not a cutesey boy
+++ interesting supporting roles, played by relatively unknown actors
+++ not one father or politician is played by Anupam Kher

- the movie's two parts with love first, then politics, are too heterogenuous
- clocking in at no less than 140 minutes, the movie feels too long, especially in the politics and songs departments
- Dhanush acts well, but his longing for the unreachable lady feels ridiculous; this desparate over-dramatic longing for a distant ladylove looks much more appropriate in a more ironic, comedic Dhanush movie such as ""Yaaradi Nee Mohini"" (2008, Tamil)
- Dhanush's change from a suburban simpleton to a political leader is not shown credibly, neither his fixation on the not-so-lovable Zoya
- I couldn't follow all changes and turns in the story
- my Eros Bluray (yes, Bluray) didn't have a single extra, not even trailers; the subtitles were ok and included the songs, but not some crucial newspaper headlines

The streetfighting, the heated political atmosphere, the corrupt politicians and A.R. Rahman's slightly military-mechanic-electrical music (certainly not his best score) reminded me of Rang de Basanti; the music in Basanti is certainly more memorable though.",1390694400,,1609,5.28125
