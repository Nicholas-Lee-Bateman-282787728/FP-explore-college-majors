8387925,5,B0033C5MTG,"Fantastic workout with bands or weights.  Great instructor, excellent cueing, total body conditioning and a nice change from other strength training routines.  Perfect for traveling.  I am really pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.  Suitable for beginners, intermediate and advanced.",1409356800,,305,6.023255813953488
8387926,3,B0033C5MTG,"I have a hard time being in love with any exercise program except walking, but this program helps me from getting bored with the same old routine.",1363737600,,146,4.444444444444445
8387927,5,B0033C5MTG,Great strength training workout with resistance bands (not included). Easy cueing and modifcations of the exercises are shown for different levels.,1310601600,3,147,6.0476190476190474
8387928,4,B0033C5MTG,"This workout can be as hard or as easy as you need it to be based on the size of the workout band you choose.  All muscle groups are worked (arms, legs, core).  Some of the exercises are done with a band wrapped around the ankles, and while these really gave the hips a workout, I can see how you can easily lose your balance if you're not careful (I haven't wiped out yet, though!)  I originally bought this video to use as therapy for a shoulder injury, and it really helped.  There are no difficult dance routines to learn, and the instructor is likeable.",1295222400,6,558,4.285714285714286
8387929,5,B0033C5MTG,"This is a surprisingly well-organized workout with excellent transitions.  The instructor, Paul Katami, for me is one of the most likeable (next to Michael Carson) male DVD instructors.  His diction is clear and evenly paced, he  cues superbly with easy instructions and consistently and safely describes how to hold and use the tubing and a loop. This 45 minute workout does not have chapters or options, so be prepared to commit time for the entire workout.

You'll perform 2 rounds of each section, like a circuit.  FIRST section of exercises utilizes the tubing concentrating on the upper body. You'll start with a slow tempo first in the first round to familiarize the move.  There is a modifier for the entire workout and challenge moves.
SECOND section uses the loop around feet focusing on the lower body with moves such as the side step, staggered step, knee lifts, knee extensions, skater extension.  You'll individually work each leg.
THIRD section has combinations of tubing (upper body) & loop (feet). In my favorite section, you'll work balance & stability by doing bicep curls simultaneously with a hamstring extension; a shoulder lift with a leg extension, among others, plus pulses for challenge.  Complete the other side or leg for another round.
THE FOURTH section is functional training, mostly the upper body with lat pulls & lateral step, golf swing, overhead extension, chest left and cross lift.
LASTLY, lying on a mat, finish the workout with seated rows, basic crunch (loop your ankles)oblique crunch, side planks, and my personal favs: long lever crunch and long lever diagonal crunch with tubing on hand and opposite foot.  Love it!",1274140800,17,1660,5.073529411764706
