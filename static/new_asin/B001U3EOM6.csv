8342685,2,B001U3EOM6,"I had bought this same set for a friend as a gift not two months before. So i decided to get it for myself, and while all the films/DVD's were accounted for I really felt like I couldn't complain about the packaging which was completely different than the set I had bough just a month before. THAT ONE was a cardboard box/sleeve that carried all the DVD's in their own slimline jewel cases. In MIN it is one barely oversize Snap care with on flippers inside case. I didn't see liner notes in mine, why the other one has as well. In fact the one pictures to the RIGHT is the one my friends received. My copy was half that size.

So I have to assume this is some cheaper, second printing. Not really very pleased with this purchase, but I like this films too much to risk sending them back.",1353369600,4,788,4.218543046357616

This collection includes the excellent documentary ""O Estranho Mundo de Z do Caixo"", which will make you know the great artist and creator he is. He's a great director and was a hard critic of Brazilan favelas' problems, religion and drugs. His movies were banned or some of their scenes were cut by the goverment. With a very low budget he has created one of the most interesting characters in horror movies, the misogynist Z do Caixo (Coffin Joe). The sound and image of the films contained in this collection are very good or good. If you like the films in this boxset I highly recommend you his last one, ""Embodiment of Evil"". If you want to see something different, with an open mind, buy it now and create you complete Coffin Joe Collection! If you are not interested in low budget art films, there is the Twilight Saga, enjoy it!!",1343520000,5,965,4.52
