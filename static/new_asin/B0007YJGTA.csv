8054121,5,B0007YJGTA,I bought this Box Set from a Movie Stop for 3.99 and for that price it is a great deal. However it is not worth the 70 dollars + that it sells for here on Amazon. You would be better off paying for the internet and watching demonstrations on YouTube. You could probably find cheaper instructionals that are less expensive.,1311465600,,322,4.383333333333334
8054122,4,B0007YJGTA,The only reason I gave this product four stars is because the DVDs does not play in all DVD players. I tried in ten different DVD players and it played only in one. I don't know if anybody else had the same problems. Other than that these disk are AMAZING even for those that never had JUDO  X-pirience would be very beneficial. I highly suggest this product to every body.,1297900800,,373,4.328571428571428
8054123,5,B0007YJGTA,"I've had this set for about 2 years now. Though I train in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, and not Judo, this set has been very helpful with my standup grappling game, especially while wearing a gi. The production value is very good, and though it was originally filmed in French, the English translation is very clear. If you're a into Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, or any other related grappling arts, this set should prove helpful with your throws and takedowns.",1278806400,,451,4.87012987012987
8054124,2,B0007YJGTA,"I've only watched 1/4 of the volume on throws on my computer. Turns out the DVD is PAL and it won't play on regular US DVD players or even on a Playstation3, so I can't possibly watch it on my TV. I've already put the set back in its original packaging and I will be returning it at once.

What I've seen is quite disappointing. Throws are grouped by type (leg vs hip throws, for example), without regard for their complexity. Following the Gokyo makes much more sense to me, although that's really a personal opinion. The throws are shown relatively quickly, without really bothering to discuss the differences between them (e.g., O vs Uki Goshi). Some throws are done incorrectly, e.g., O Goshi is shown with the hand way up on Uke's back. On the other hand, training for a few throws is shown in excruciating detail.

The original soundtrack is French, and as in any such situations the English track is a bit ""funny"" at times (e.g., ""mows"" instead of ""sweeps"").

I haven't seen the other two videos (or the other 3/4 of the throws), so I'd like to qualify my review.

This is one to skip. I would love to get my hands on Mike Swain's Complete Judo instead; unfortunately, Amazon does not sell it.",1261180800,7,1200,4.490825688073395
8054125,5,B0007YJGTA,"I've had these DVD's for about 6 months now.  I bought them because I was interested in seeing Judo training methods used in France.  I was not disappointed. All three DVD's are full of drills and instruction for tachiwaza and newaza. The instruction is high quality and the English track is acceptable.  These DVD's would be valuable even with out an English track.  The instructors have great foot work and by just watching them I was able to pick up on things.

The content can be broken down like this-

Disc 1-  Basic instruction on single techniques.  Plenty of instruction, advice, and drills to keep beginners busy for a long time.

Disc 2- Using the basic techniques from the first disc in combination.  This was the best disc for me.  There are many combinations and drills covered on the disc.  Great stuff for intermediate players.

Disc 3-  This one is titled Competition Techniques, but it's really about strategy.  The material covered here has to do with gripping patterns and setting up your techniques in randori and shiai.  This is good stuff for everyone from neophyte to expert.  There is no really ground breaking information provided here, but the concepts are so well illustrated that you cannot fail to get something out of this disc.

I highly recommend this set.  Every club should own a set.  Our dojo has learned allot from it and the drills have been great for both or adult and children's class.  I'd give it 6 stars if the scale went that high.",1131321600,59,1476,4.6875
