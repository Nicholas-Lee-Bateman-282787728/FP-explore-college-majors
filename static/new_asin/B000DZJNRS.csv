8103018,5,B000DZJNRS,"Excellent DVD for techniques, covering several drills.  The only flaw I found was that the there are not slow-motion, real close ups of the sets and  hand position to see *Exactly* where and how the hand contacts the ball, how much the fingers should bend, etc.",1222041600,,261,4.6521739130434785
8103019,3,B000DZJNRS,"I play 10+ yrs and coach some boy and girl volleyball ""club"", and season club ball. I found this video very helpfull, ""OK"". However, it seem so easy for the players in the dvd to apply the technique, because they are advance or professional level, I base on the food-work.

I use some of his drills, and they works for some kids (""guid the dogs"" set the ball to the ground). Very good tips, A+.
Two things you will get from this DVD: he make the setting look so easy by break it down each step and each level. And he help to build the trust level in the atheles.

I apply some of that to the H.S. girls volleyball and they very interested. For my atheles think the setting so easy, so they willing to practice the technique.

The DVD certainlly will be the best tools for 7-12 grader coach but not for advance level players. Too many details have skim through quickly.

But if anyone want more should read the Coaching Volleyball by Kinda S. Asher; Mental Toughness Training for Volleyball by Mike Voight""...
And anyone want more ""CREATE YOUR OWN"" drills is a must for the coach position. ""One size don't fit all"", treat every atheles individual...",1195171200,,1148,4.4523809523809526
8103020,3,B000DZJNRS,"In my opinion this DVD is not meant for a newbie.  It's more suited to fine-tune your setting skills if you are already at least an intermediate setter (although, a persistent beginner might find it useful).  All 34 minutes are a laundry list of many possible setting drills with about 2-minute demonstration per each: setting with one hand (who knew!), back-setting, left/right setting and so on.

The drills seem logical and useful. The problem for me, is that the coach is not really giving any pointers. 15 girls demonstrate obediently and unemotionally. Not a sound of excitement, not a smile..it's all quiet in the gym.

I know this video is very useful, but as hard as I tried, I just could not get beyond its poor quality. Let's start with the coach himself..His vocabulary consists of 15 words on a good day! Add to this fact only one face expression and a sense that he just had a heavy meal-you get a video with some potential but falls short.  The most-used (or abused) word is ""okay"". ""Okay this/Okay that""! I had hard times understanding him.

Secondly, I found myself wanting a few close-up shots. The coach can really give some pointers/corrections to focus on, rather than just list the drills.

Yes, I know, he has a good reputation as a coach, but what he is teaching here is not rocket science! To me a good coach must be a good communicator above anything else.

Finally, the price: $30 for only 34 minutes is a bit steep.

To sum this up: Even though the drills are excellent and will effectively do the job of improving your setting, this video lacks good instuction/pointers from the coach, is poorly made, and too expensive for what it offers.",1191888000,3,1668,4.64625850340136
8103021,4,B000DZJNRS,"It's a little hard to understand the speaker, but I have to say, for the money, this is a good DVD.  There's other stuff out there that cost a lot more.  This DVD focuses on drills.  So if you need drills to run, this has some good ones.  If your setter is a beginner, this will be helpful for sure...at a good cost because he does mention the different focuses needed for effective setting. Basically, I was hoping for more...BUT...I don't feel like I wasted my money or anything because it covers the basics, and gives instruction on how to practice to get better.",1191024000,,566,4.413461538461538
