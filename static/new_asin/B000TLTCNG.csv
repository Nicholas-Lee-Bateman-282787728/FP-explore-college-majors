2906618,4,B000TLTCNG,"The show aired for one season from October 1959 to April 1960.  32 episodes were produced but the set contains only 12 one hour shows. I'm not sure how the 12 episodes were picked. It's hard to judge the quality of a show when you have only a third of the episodes on which to base your opinion. The setting for the show is in Oklahoma post Civil War era. Matt Rockford is the mayor of Cimmaron City and is the central character who solves all the town's problems and mysteries. Although the show is set in the Wild West, many of the plots are not really traditionally western in nature. For example, there is one show where Matt Rockford is a prisoner in a silver mine. Another show is something out of horror movie which features a severely deformed many who travels down the Oklahoma territory killing innocent people. There are a few good shows that fit with the western style genre. For example the episode To Become a Man is classic for it's portrayal of honor, courage, manhood, and western style shootouts. I guess you can say that Cimmaron City is an action/mystery show that is set in the west.

The quality of the video and audio is less than desirable and the acting is not as good as you would see in other westerns such as Gunsmoke and the Rifleman. I love westerns from the 1950s era but I really struggle with this one. It is no where near a 5 star rating but I'm not sure it is a low as a three either. If you love westerns you should get this show to fill out your collection. If you are looking for a top quality show, I wouldn't buy it.",1212364800,31,1556,4.271186440677966
2906619,5,B000TLTCNG,"If you asked fans of old TV western series to recall the names of 5 or even 10 series from the heyday of the era in the late 50's ,early 60's it is unlikely thatCimarron City would be one of those mentioned. Not because it was bad series, more likely because it ran only one season of 26 episodes at a time when the airwaves were dominated by over 20 westerns per week. It is also sometimes confused with the later Stuart Whitman series `Cimarron Strip'

Surprising, but welcome therefore, that Timeless Media have released a dozen of those episodes along with several other western series recently.

Cimarron City appeared in the 50 minute format from 1958/60. Starring George Montgomery, an excellent western hero from many features in the late 40's/50's.

It was a `Mont Production' indicating Montgomery had a hand in the production.

Montgomery played Matt Rockford cattle rancher & mayor of Cimarron City in the 1890's. His father had been the founder of the town & Rockford was anxious for it to grow & prosper. Also in the regular cast were Audrey Totter as hotel owner Beth Purcell & John Smith (later star of Laramie) as Deputy Sheriff Lane Temple. Also appearing was Dan Blocker of Bonanza fame who had a recurring role as Tiny Buddinger, a townsman & slight comic relief. Curiously in an early episode Blocker played a villain of the same name. Montgomery does not appear in every episode.

Cimarron City was very much an adult western. relying on strong plotlines & characterisation rather than fights, chases & gunplay. Numerous guest stars included Fred MacMurray in the pilot (sadly not included in this set) the always menacing Dan Duryea, Elizabeth Montgomery, Dorothy Provine & J Carrol Naish. Seasoned western aficionados will also spot Don Megowan & the ever sneering Robert Wilke in familiar roles. Interesting plots include the tracking of a mysterious beast & the outbreak of bubonic plague, along with the usual western fare.

The episodes in this set comprise

  2 Terror Town
  3  To Become a Man
  5  Medicine Man
  6  Hired Hand
  8 Beast of the Cimarron
 10 The Bloodline
 13 The Bitter Lesson
 18 Beauty & the Sorrow
 19  Return of the Dead
 22 The Ratman
 23 Have Sword, Will Duel
 26 The Evil One

 It appears that the deal struck between Timeless Media & NBC relates only to the `rights' to issue these series, not the supply of original prints which apparently are very costly to remaster. Accordingly Timeless have to track down their own prints which seem to come from 16mm sources. They do seem to have found some decent masters here & although they are not as sharp & detailed as studio prints, are still quite clean & clear. Do not expect the same quality obtainable from some other black & white series such as `Gunsmoke' or `Rawhide' currently available from Paramount. There are the odd flecks & scratches & they are not as `sharp as some but perfectly watchable. Sound seems fine & quite distinct.

There are 3 discs (4 episodes per disc), each in its own case in an outer slip case.

If you prefer the `Roy Rogers' style western with lots of action then these may disappoint, on the other hand if you like `Gunsmoke' with its more involved storylines then I'm sure this will appeal. I think TV western fans familiar with the genre should enjoy.

I was unsure whether to award 4 or 5 stars, based on the print quality, but all things considered & knowing the problems involved I have given it 5. It is pleasing that Timeless have released Cimarron City as the major studios would never consider it & it is probably the only opportunity we will get to revisit some of these vintage shows.",1203292800,93,3631,4.667716535433071
2906620,4,B000TLTCNG,Cimarron City will remind you about what was graet in early TV westerns. The stories were short morality plays that were easy to follow and the good guys end up on top. Cimarron City pretty much follows the formula but adds a splash of characterization which lifts it above other westerns of the period. It is aslo fun to see Dan Blocker before he became Hoss.,1200614400,8,360,4.46969696969697

I only bought it to see John Smith and he was fantastic as usual. I only wish that the series would have been longer and we could have seen more of John Smith as Sheriff Lane Temple. His style of acting was so smooth and easy-going, yet very believable. He was quiet and strong at the same time - just a very unique actor.

2906686,4,B000TLTCNG,"Matt Rockford (George Montgomery)Mister Rock, as his straw-boss calls himis a successful cattleman whose late father was the first to dream of Cimarron City and erected the first house there.  Now, 25 years later, the place is thriving, with new settlers coming in every week.  In the first episode, Cimarron and Rockford find themselves faced with a former faro dealer who so convincingly ingratiates himself with the citizenry that he becomes first banker, then mayor, then gradually part-owner of half the businesses in town, and at last comes close to ruling the place, before Matt and his young friend Lane Temple (John Smith) are able to force him and several of his hired guns into a confrontation.  Thereafter Matt is elected to fill the suddenly vacant office, and Lane becomes deputy for Sheriff Art Samson (Stuart Randall, who later would work with Smith as Sheriff Mort Corey on Laramie) in addition to serving as our jack-of-all-trades, primarily blacksmith, cabinetmaker, and livery-stable keeper, with some thought of law school in future.  (Fans of Laramie will noticeespecially in the episode The Beast of the Cimarrona faint but distinct, and rather long, scar on Smith's left cheek, which also shows in a few of the other series' black-and-white segments.)  Lane lives in a boardinghouse run by Beth Purcell (Audrey Totter), a gambler's widow of whom he seems quite protective, although if she's a couple with anyone it's probably Matt.  There's also a sizable cast of recurring townsfolk whose names keep turning up in the credits crawl.

Many of the episodes feature complex relationships and human conflicts, some of them between individuals, others within a single character.  To the town come a doctor and his wife on the run from a vengeful Army officer, a rancher's widowed daughter-in-law with an agenda of her own, a gang of gunmen who decide to levy a tribute on the citizens in return for not staying in the vicinity, a couple of ladies with a secret (one of whom Lane falls for), an old outlaw and his recently-discovered son, a former cowboy who was betrayed by his girl and his friend and is out to settle the score after six years in prison, a wandering pressman and the daughter he's grimly determined to keep from falling into sin.  Theres a rather creepy story about an ambitious young singer, her two suitors, and the absinthe-drinking choirmaster whos obsessed with her.  Beths and Matts pasts both come back to haunt them, and Cimarron is threatened by the bubonic plague, hosts a visiting Russian Grand Duke whos in peril of abduction, and gets a rail spur by way of a former sea captain turned labor contractor and his gang of Chinese workers.  Matt and Lane lead a hunt for a mysterious beast haunting the bottoms of the Cimarron River after it kills an itinerant peddler, and Lane tries to help the whiskey-soaked son of the famous scout who helped found Cimarron City when he becomes the tool of a con artist.  And, hardly more than a boy, as one of his critics observes, he faces the greatest test of his position as deputy when an outlaw gang threatens to burn Cimarron City to the ground if their boss's brother isn't released from jail.

It's not completely clear when the series is set, but the map in Matt's office in the Town Hall shows the northwestern quarter of Oklahoma as Oklahoma Territory and the remaining (northeastern and southern) regions as Indian Territory, something seen only on maps printed after 1890, and both Tulsa (inhabited by 1882, incorporated 1898) and Oklahoma City (founded 1889) are mentioned.  Guest stars include Fred MacMurray, John Anderson, Dan Duryea, Dan Blocker (not yet known as Hoss Cartwright, who appears once as an outlaw, again as the outlaw's twin brother, and thereafter becomes a semi-regular), Nick Adams, John Dehner, Elizabeth Montgomery, Mike Connors (later of Mannix fame), Gary Merrill, June Lockhart, Robert J. Wilkie, Dan Megowan (twice), Linda Darnell, Edgar Buchanan, Dean Stockwell, Dorothy Malone, Glenda Farrell, Harold J. Stone, J. Carrol Naish, James Griffith, Richard Jaeckel, Larry Pennell, Kathleen Crowley, Dorothy Provine, John Carradine, Debra Paget (whom Im so used to seeing as a brunette that I didn't recognize her as a blonde until I saw her name in the credits), George Hamilton (very young, but that profile is unmistakable), Diane Brewster, Peter Graves, Everett Sloane, John McIntire, Pernell Roberts (later Adam Cartwright, but this time playing a smooth-talking, rapier-wielding Irish outlaw).  And Robert Fuller, with whom the following year Smith would partner for the first of four seasons of Laramie.  One episode was co-written by Bennett Foster and Thomas Thompson, minor but respected writers of Western novels; another is from a story by Ernest Haycox.",1435017600,5,4788,5.0494296577946765

This is like James Garner taking a powder from Rockford Files. It just isn't done.

It is apparent why this show only lasted one season.

Then too, initially John Smith is a deputy, but the real sheriff is hardly around. Then shazam, without fanfare or explanation, Smith IS the Sheriff and he and Audrey Trotter become the stars of the show. I've got some episodes to go, I hope George Montgomery comes back some time soon.

2906717,3,B000TLTCNG,"I bought this series because of John Smith...one of the stars of Laramie!  This series lasted only one year...but Smith
moved on into Laramie....and made his mark.  Cimarron City was not terrible, but it lacked much of the chemistry
achieved by other stars in other series.  It was said that George Montgomery had control over much of the content...and often took on parts meant for Smith. This was not a smart move....he was stiff and unemotional and simply wrong for the part.
 My favorite episode was one with Smith and Robert Fuller......who also moved on to Laramie
as co-star.  They worked well in the episode...and even better in Laramie.  Dan Blocker was a supporting actor.....he was
later to prove himself as an actor in Bonanza...but his role in Cimarron City did not do him justice.  Audrey Totter left the series during its run....perhaps because of dissatisfaction with her role.  It is easy to understand why this show was not renewed....
it was often tiresome and the stories dragged out.....too often concentrating on Montgomery!  There were some good guest stars, but over-all.....not one of my favorite picks.",1392940800,3,1128,5.021505376344086

Don't waste your money. But another set, not the Collectors Tin.  I learned to read the basic report and do the math as to the minutes on the DVD. The reviews were very misleading and cost me money I didn't need to lose. If I am wrong, I would really like to know how the reviewers in questions found 12 shows in this set?",1303862400,5,641,4.195121951219512
2906734,2,B000TLTCNG,"While it is nice to have decent copies of episodes of this classic western series, the information provided was at best incomplete.  The item description did not state how many or which episodes were included.  I purposely bought this specific collection to have a copy of the ""Terror Town"" episode from year one. One lengthy review listed this as one of the specific episodes included.  Mea Culpa! Each disc has only two episodes, and neither disc had the episode I wanted.  This whole problem could have been avoided if the description had provided more complete information.  I'll know better next time!",1303776000,5,606,4.96039603960396

2906737,2,B000TLTCNG,"I was dissapointed that firstly, there were only 12 episodes on the box set and also the fact that they didn't appear to be in chronological order. For someone viewing this for the first time, as I was, it made it really disjointed and you didn't get a sense of continuity or getting to know the characters as you would if you watched a series in its entireity and in order. I get very cynical with 'best of' box sets as this would seemingly appear to be designed to be ( although I have heard that there were much better episodes not included - 'Blind is the Killer' for one) particullary if there is an intention at a later date to release the show in its entireity. I think if you are going to release a one season show like this, its not helpful to just release a few episodes - I really think it should be all or nothing. Have to say I was very dissapointed as a result.",1259107200,23,875,4.152941176470589
2906738,5,B000TLTCNG,"There are only 4 episodes in this 2 disc collection.  Happily, 3 of the 4 were
not on the 12 episode, 3 disc collection released last year.  So, 15 episodes
of the 26 episode series have thus far been released.  But you'd never know
that or the difference by reading the front cover or Amazon's description.
(I have not watched the discs yet, so I presume they are decent quality but
off a 16 mm, not the original 32 mm film, like the last set of 3 discs.)
Still have 11 episodes to go.....",1250640000,9,490,4.191489361702128

the black and white better on the disc some are so light its hard to see the video..
if you gonna sell these for money pay someone another $50 and have the video
right before you mass produce them.. Montgomery and smith are great western
actors I'm just glad I was excited and bought this retail set so I could watch the
shows without the grit label on the lower screen, but my set recorded off grit is so
much clearer I will still be watching the show with grit on the lower screen..lol",1493078400,,575,4.1891891891891895
