8294673,2,B000MGBM2M,"Usually The Imagery On The Cover Of A DVD Depicts Only A Frame Of The Motion Picture In The DVD Video.  Don't Worry You Will Absolutely Not Get Even A Single Picture Of Ken Shamrock In, Around, Or Even Of Ken Shamrock Viewing The Octagon Or WWF Ring.  So I Guess Behind The Octagon Would Be A Good Name For It.

Do Not Let The Cover Fool You.
The Facts: The Whole 2 Hour Video Is Of A Single Sit Down Interview (I Guess This Is What They Call A Shoot Interview) With The Camera On Ken Shamrock's Face.  And It Is In No Way Shape Or Form Professionally Done.
The Interview Was Done (From What I Can Tell)Around The Year 2000.  He Talks About Tito Ortiz But This Is Before They Were Rivals And Had A Hatred For Each Other And It Was After He Left The WWF.

Having Said That If You Are A Fan Of Ken Shamrocks Like I Am Then You Can't Go Wrong With A 2 Hour Interview With Ken Reflecting On His Career.  The Only Downside Here Is That They Talk Too Much About People I Have Never Heard Of From Japan Wrestling And Other Such Orginizateions Besides WWF And UFC Ken Has Been Involved With, And Asking How Ken Felt About These People.",1204761600,,1127,4.095454545454546
