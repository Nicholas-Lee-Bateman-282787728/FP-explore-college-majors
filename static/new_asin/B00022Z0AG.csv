8175768,5,B00022Z0AG,"I will try and do a review for you on this one. There are 9 mood scenes on this DVD. And iv given it 5 stars. But only TWO of the mood scenes deserved that number of stars, and one of those is WATER DANCE. As you may guess, its water danceing to music and lights. A wonderful display, so beautiful to watch. A Showcase Spectacular. BRILLANT would be the perfect word for it.  The next mood scene that i like is GONDOLA RIDE. This is a very nice one. A short gondola ride at Night Time in VENICE, passing underneath a well lit up low bridge and comeing out into a beautiful lamped courtyard. Two more mood scenes is MISTY MOON and EIFFEL TOWER. They are a freeze frame and both are alright, but nothing very much is happening in them. The other mood scenes on this DVD are not worth a mention. Some are Time Lapse photography. There are extras on this DVD also. One of them is called PARTY COLLECTION its great. You will see LAVALAND... TECHNICOLOR LOUNGE...VORTEX ABYSS...LASER TAG...WEIRD SCIENCE...SPINAL TAP...KALEIDOSCOPE...BUBBLICIOUS.... Now i will give the titles of the 9 mood scenes on this DVD they are... MISTY MOON...BAY BRIDGE...CRACKLING FIRE...NEW YORK NIGHTS...EIFFEL TOWER...SATIN SHEETS...GONDOLA RIDE...CELTIC SUNSET...WATER DANCE.",1348444800,,1250,4.89622641509434
