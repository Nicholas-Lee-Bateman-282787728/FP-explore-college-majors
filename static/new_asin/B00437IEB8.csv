4253702,5,B00437IEB8,"I didn't think the second series of this remarkable TV series could beat the first for pure entertainment, but despite that box having 6 discs and this one only 2, the series really gets into its stride this time round, and Elvis surpasses his easy going but hysterical presentation style, to the extent that if Jools Holland ever retries Elvis would make a perfect replacement . This set warrants numerous repeat plays and for me the best episode is the one which features Nick Lowe, Richard Thompson, Alan Toussaint and The Band's Levon Helm doing what they all do best. Priceless.",1320019200,2,583,4.782178217821782
4253703,3,B00437IEB8,"Like another reviewer, I have playback problems, disc two won't play for me, disc one is fine.  Amazon was nice enough to exchange my first order, but the second one was exactly as the first.  My DVD player is high end, but seven years old.  Never had this problem before.  Must be a region problem.  Otherwise, this series is great.",1311206400,3,333,4.483333333333333
4253704,4,B00437IEB8,"This is a truly great show, and a real shame we don't see this type of TV series more!
It is kind of similar to Storytellers but offers more unique performances (duets etc.), or if you want to the Conan O'Brian U2 special from 2005. Makes for a great entertaining no matter if you like the artist or not.

For me the highlights are:
Alison - this is by far one of Bono's greatest vocal performances EVER - they should make a ""jazz-club"" style record one day
Pump It Up / Get on your boots medley - absolutely stunning mash-up!
Sham-A-Ling-Dong-Ding by J.Winchester - no wonder other performers cracked in to tears this is so simple song yet so touching.
The Rising by mighty Bruce.

The quality of this release is also great - packed in a slip-case, with small but informative booklet.

Just WHY WHY WHY the authoring of both disk is dreadful, there are about 4-5 indexes per each episode, but they're nowhere near the songs! You have to manually search the performance! This is ridiculous.

The running time according to box is 350 min

4253705,1,B00437IEB8,Discs won't play; Ive tried 3 different machines. My DVD Players are each 5 to 8 yrs old but rarely do I have a title that won't play in at least one machine. Anyone else had this problem w/Spectacle S.2?,1310428800,,204,4.125
4253706,4,B00437IEB8,"I did not have an opportunity to see this Canadian produced show - which was recorded at both the famous Apollo Theater in New York and in Canada - on cable TV and I have not seen Season One yet, so, when Music Video Distributors released this set this month (they are not involved with Season One), I checked it out. Up front I have to tell you that I'm not a fan of Elvis Costello's singing. I think he's VERY knowledgeable - and his rapport with his guests (including insightful questions) is obvious - but I just never got into his vocalizations. That said, I really enjoyed this set.

The centerpiece is the two-part interview with Springsteen. I don't ever remember Springsteen doing an interview that long. He is very open and relaxed (almost to the point where he stumbles when trying to get words out (lots of ""uh""'s) but that makes it real. And he plays great! So ALL Springsteen fans - if you haven't seen these shows, grab this.

The other episodes are interesting too. EC mixes John Prine, Lyle Lovett and the newer discovery Ray LaMontagne in one show and have then sing together at the end. There is Levon Helm (who couldn't talk - only play - because of his throat surgery) along with Nick Lowe and Richard Thompson. How often are you going to see that?

I have one gripe with this set though - and I'm not sure if it happened on Season One. The 50-minute episodes are ""indexed"" into chapters (usually five). But they are not indexed by the songs performed! You if you want to go back and hear a song, you need to ""scan"" through to find it. That was really annoying and forced me to drop my rating, from what would be an obvious five stars, to four.

4253707,4,B00437IEB8,"I dock this two-DVD set a star only because the second season of Spectacle, originally broadcast on the Sundance Channel, was truncated by it's abrupt cancellation in 2009. The interviews and performances are eminently watchable and listenable, however.

The inimitable genius Elvis Costello, a walking musical encyclopedia, hosts the show. It's a relaxed mixture of conversation and song with some of the finest musicians and songwriters working today: Bono and The Edge on the first program; Neko Case, Sheryl Crow, Ron Sexsmith, and Jesse Winchester on the second; Levon Helm, Nick Lowe, Richard Thompson, and Allen Toussaint on the third; Elvis himself on the fourth (interviewed by actress Mary-Louise Parker); Ray LaMontagne, Lyle Lovett, and John Prine on the fifth; and Bruce Springsteen as the sole guest on the final two programs.

There are four extras on the DVDs: a behind-the-scenes documentary called ""Inside Notes"" hosted by co-executive producer David Furnish, and three bonus performances including a cover of U2's song ""Dirty Day"" by Elvis and the Imposters, a cover of Elvis' song ""Alison"" by Bono and the Edge, and Costello and the Imposters playing his own song ""I Want You.""

These seven shows plus extras run 315 minutes in total, less than half the length of the five-disc first-season set, which dates from 2008. The latter costs slightly less than this new release, so if you want value for money, start with Season One. But both sets are certainly worthwhile.",1307404800,23,1487,5.161825726141079
4253708,5,B00437IEB8,"Season Two of Elvis Costello's interview/jam session show is worth the purchase for the two episodes of his interview with Bruce Springsteen.  Mr. Costello & Mr. Springsteen are old friends and it shows in the playful banter the two exchange.  The musical numbers are awesome including an inspired medley of Mr. Springsteen's ""Radio Nowhere"" and Mr. Costello's ""Radio Radio"" as well as a take of Sam & Dave's ""I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down"" (which Mr. Costello covered on his Get Happy!!! album) in which they decide which one of them is going be Sam and who is going to be Dave.  Mr. Costello has an inquisitive interviewing style and his status as a rock legend himself helps him get more out of his guests than just a normal interviewer might.",1304467200,19,750,4.666666666666667
8414224,5,B00437IEB8,"I got the DVD's to each season as soon as they originally came out and have had no issues with them. Others have reported technical problems with their DVD's or Blu-rays.

If you own and enjoy one season, I highly suggest you buy the other season as well. They are equally balanced with well known and lesser known singer-songwriters. Each episode aired for an hour on TV but is really only about 50 minutes or less, to leave time for commercials. It would be nice if there were more extras, like a ""making of"" featurette for the season, extra performances or sound check moments, etc. Still, for the price you get a LOT of great music and information, so I couldn't bring myself to deduct a star from  the rating.

The guests in Season One are: Elton John, Bill Clinton,Tony Bennett, Lou Reed, Julian Schnabel, The Police, Smokey Robinson, Rufus Wainwright, Jakob Dylan, Jenny Lewis, She & Him, Diana Krall, Herbie Hancock, Rosanne Cash, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, John Mellencamp, James Taylor, Renee Fleming.

The guests in Season Two are: Bono and the Edge (U2), Sheryl Crow, Ron Sexsmith, Neko Case, Jesse Winchester, Allen Toussaint, Richard Thompson, Nick Lowe, Levon Helm, Mary-Louise Parker,Lyle Lovett, John Prine, Ray LaMontagne, Bruce Springsteen.

The show has helped expand my musical horizon. I have rewatched and enjoyed and learned something from every episode. It gave me a fresh insight to artists whose work I knew and enjoyed, as well as artists I knew very little of and dismissed (and have since revisited), and introduced me to many new artists. That's what a good music show SHOULD do!

Elvis Costello is such a music lover and has a great and vast background so he can relate to his guests as a peer, which can lead to some more interesting questions; admittedly, the discussion of song craft can go over a typical fan's head. And I like hearing the various interpretations of songs but I can also see how most people would rather hear LESS of Elvis Costello performing and more of the guests. I enjoy seeing the live band and wonderful guest musicians.

I can understand audiences would rather see a big singing star performing and being interviewed on TV than the person who wrote the songs for him/her discussing their songwriting craft and inspirations. I think one of the intentions of Costello and Elton John and others on the show is to make the public more aware of other important and talented singer-songwriters who are influential but not so popular or well known (ex. Laura Nyro).

IMO it's unfortunate that shows like American Idol can linger while this IMPORTANT music show lasted only 2 seasons on TV. I can see how this show, as it was presented, might not tickle everyone's fancy but I hope that it (or something equivalent) gets on TV again. In the UK they have had Later With Jools Holland for years and in North America we have nothing to compare to these.",1525132800,,2908,4.7673956262425445

8414226,1,B00437IEB8,"I love the show -- I happened to see it while channel surfing back when I subscribed to cable TV, and made a point of tuning in from then on. 1-star rating is because of problems with the DVDs. Season 2 is a two disk set. I've bought it twice, and disk 2, from either set, won't play on my DVD player. The first time I bought it, it was packaged with Season 1, and I didn't send it back because the Season 1 disks worked, and I wanted to keep them. Ordered Season 2 again, and the second set has the same problem.",1451260800,,513,3.9423076923076925
