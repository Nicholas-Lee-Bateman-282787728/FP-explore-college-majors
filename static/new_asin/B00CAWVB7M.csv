8579315,5,B00CAWVB7M,Great drama with surprisingly good subtitles. I love Chinese history plus romance and drama this has it all. The story is amazing I have seen a lot of Chinese historicals and this ranks on top. If history is not your thing it's just a great drama to watch. All of the characters personalities really were so well explained and how they impacted China to me was again a history lesson in drama form. Thanks seller and Amazon.,1428192000,4,424,4.51948051948052
