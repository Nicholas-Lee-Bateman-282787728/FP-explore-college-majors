5276457,1,B00979KQ5O,"The package looked good, but it turned out to be the wrong movie, something called ""The Girl Next Door"".  Don't risk it!",1388361600,,120,4.454545454545454
5276458,5,B00979KQ5O,"I'm a Loretta Young fan and she is great with Joseph Cotten.
The film is delightful and fun to watch!",1386720000,,101,4.1
5276459,5,B00979KQ5O,"My belief was, if the movie entertained you and created the emotions the director was aiming for, then it was a successful and good movie.  This was 1940s ""B"" movie is at it's best with strong lead actors and good supporting actors.  This brought back soooooo many memories of my mother letting me stay up late as a child to watch the ""Late Late Show"" with her and old movies.  If you like watching a movie with a smile on your face this is one to watch.",1382486400,2,454,4.195402298850575
5276460,5,B00979KQ5O,"I have not viewed this movie.  I purchased five copies.  My husband and his brother will get a copy as well as my three children.  These will be give as Christmas gifts.  The author, Lillian McQuarrie, my husband's aunt.  This is based on true events in Lillian's life in relation to her daughter.  I'm anxious to see it and I love Loretta Young.",1375488000,6,346,4.412698412698413
5276461,5,B00979KQ5O,"I love this movie, however I only had it on a tape I recorded.  The quality was deteriorating so wanted I wanted it on DVD, however I think it was a little pricey.  Very happy that it is part of my DVD collection!",1372809600,6,213,3.9302325581395348
5276462,4,B00979KQ5O,"I'm so grateful that the made-on-demand DVD-R is making small, delightful films like this one available at last. The story itself is lightweight, but it's told so well that you don't mind. Loretta Young is gorgeous in the larger-than-life way that Technicolor made mere mortals into Stars, playing an uptight, sharp-tongued nurse who unleashes her wild, fun-loving side once she goes to sleep & starts sleepwalking. Joseph Cotten is equally enjoyable as the befuddled object of her disdain (while she's awake) & flirtatious affection (while she's asleep). There's an innocence to this sort of film that just isn't possible today, and it's given a charmingly naughty edge by skirting the restrictions of the Hays Code as much as was possible during that time. It's a modest film, but it succeeds wonderfully on its modest terms -- recommended!",1370476800,15,842,5.153284671532846
5276463,5,B00979KQ5O,"If only real life could be so sweet, because this movie is so sweet, I loved it from the beginning to the end. I wished they would make more movies like this.",1366588800,19,158,3.96875
5276464,5,B00979KQ5O,"This is my favourite Loretta Young film.  She plays a repressed nurse with another, totally opposite personality which comes out when she is overtired. She and Joseph Cotton (another great actor) strike sparks off each other.  This is a delightful and unusual romance in lovely colour.  Its something that I watch when I need cheering up and I would recommend it to anyone.",1357257600,40,373,4.888888888888889
5276475,5,B00979KQ5O,Great!,1430006400,,6,6.0
5276476,4,B00979KQ5O,"Nice little romantic comedy from the early 50's.  Loretta young plays a repressed, straight-laced nurse who when she sleepwalks she changes personality and becomes a free-spirited temptress.  While under she romances an old acquaintance who at first doesn't recognize her, but falls under her spell.  Not Young's best, but pleasant and typical for its time.  The color and picture is good.  The 20th Century Cinema Archives DVD-R release is very good quality.  Recommended for fans of this kind of film.",1426723200,2,503,5.225
