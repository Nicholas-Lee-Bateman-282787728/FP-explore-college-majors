8617989,4,B00FQI1RO4,"Although based on a comic play by Karel Capek, this opera doesnt look or sound as a comic one.  It deals with the futility of a very long life, more than 300 years, based on an elixir of youth, and its tragic consequences.  Emilia Marty, sung by Anja Silja, who has been using various names through her 300 years, all of them using the initials EM, looks for the formula of the elixir of youth before she dies.  The libretto and the play are interesting in their own right, although in this opera it is sometimes confusing and cumbersome.  The male characters are perceived as feeble and, to my taste, are too similar to each other, creating further confusion. Even more, the male customs in this production are almost identical making it even more difficult to follow the story.  The music for Emilia and for the orchestra is where the real drama occurs.  This Blu-ray is based on a 1995 recording. The image is 4;3 and the sound is Stereo, at best, which makes the orchestra sound somehow flat, diminishing the Janacek technique of introducing, preparing and echoing the voice motifs in the orchestra. Makropulos is an opera seldom performed and even less frequently recorded, so I would recommend this Blu-ray for those interested in Janaceks operas and early twentieth century music of Eastern Europe.",1514764800,,1305,4.777777777777778

8617991,1,B00FQI1RO4,"ORIGINAL POST - The original DVD version was in stereo but this is in mono.  This is a manufacturing problem by Kultur.  I had the exact same problem with their Blu-ray issue of the Don Carlos from Paris - mono sound.

UPDATE - Based on comments, I have listened to my original DVD again.  Since the Blu-ray version was returned, I can not make a direct comparison.  The Blu-ray was definitely mono but that may not have been defective.  The DVD could have been fake stereo but it is hard for me to tell.  I can definitely here a difference in the instrumental location (particularly the strings) when I reverse my headphones but the voices seem to always to be pretty much centered.  Since the audio was preferable for me on the DVD and I don't remember a substantial improvement in the Blu-ray video, the DVD is the right choice for me but others may have a preference for the Blu-ray.  Regardless of which you might choose, it is an outstanding performance.",1397260800,5,960,4.534883720930233
