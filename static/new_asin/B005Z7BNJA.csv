4907015,5,B005Z7BNJA,"I am new to the Twilight saga. I have yet to read the books, and will do some day when I can afford to buy the books. But the movies I fell in love with. The actors are very good at what they do, they play their parts well. I love all three of them, there is no real favorite. The movies are kinda quick. But when it comes to younger geared movies like these three, the less complex the better. The simpleness and the romance I adored. I tend to look at movies with the appreciation of the screenwriter's point of view. It's fantasy, it's young romance... it's sweet. And I appreciate these things in this movie. So I give it 5 stars because of the beauty of it all... the storyline, the actors, the scenery... I'm in love with Twilight!",1323043200,,737,4.197183098591549
4907016,5,B005Z7BNJA,"I have the first three movies. I didn't buy them as a set which was fine with me. Anyone that gives the move a bad review should not have bought them in the first place. I did see all three movies before I bought them so it wasn't new to me but I liked the movies a lot in the theater and have the Blue Ray version for my home. I am going to see the fourth movie tomorrow. I saw the first three with my granddaughter. She read the books and kind of knew what was going to happen. The third was the best. A lot of action, explanations about the characters and how they got to be what they are. The third one has special effects that were very good. The werewolves were amazing. My granddaughter doesn't want to see the next one though. She said the book wasn't that good, but I think she is nervous about the scenes when Bella has her baby. I am going alone to see this and I will tell her if it may be something she wants to see. She is 14 and very shy. Anyway, I noticed the first one is on TV a lot so if anyone wants to see the first ones before they buy them it won't be a problem. Can always rent them too. Wish I wasn't going alone but no one around here want to see it. Never went to the show alone before but I gotta do what I'm going to do. Am curious and have read the reviews so I also know what to expect. I'm sure it will be very good.",1322352000,3,1348,3.835125448028674
4907017,4,B005Z7BNJA,"Was looking for a package of just the DVD's of all three movies, found it and at a really reasonable price.  They came in much more quickly than what was anticipated.  The only issue is that the DVD's while watching seem to pause out for a slight second at various points during the movies but not sure if that is something that is from the company who created the DVD's themselves.  Otherwise very happy to have them!  Will be back to order when the final two come out!",1322265600,6,470,4.306818181818182
4907018,2,B005Z7BNJA,"The actors are mostly new. They try hard to do their best; but the writing was terrible. You could guess what was going to happen 10 minutes before it happened. The vampires have NO fangs, but can leave marks when they bite and there is a lot of hissing. It is a love story. Human girl falls in love with vampire and wants to become one, but her second love is a werewolf who tries to disuade her. This is definitely a 'Chick flick' show. It is predictable to the state of boredom.",1320883200,,481,4.182795698924731

4907112,4,B005Z7BNJA,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Fans of the TWILIGHT movies are dedicated to say the least. Theaters were flooded with this legion of fans when each movie was released and when the DVDs came out new sales records were being set left and right. When the series ended the question was left what they would do with no more movies coming out?

New series of films featuring young casts have been released like THE HUNGER GAMES and INSURRGENT. Both are doing well but not near the same as the TWILIGHT saga did when released. So what was it that made it so special? Why was it the hit that it was? Most importantly did you even see this series?

Well if you missed out on it somehow or felt that the purchase price of all those different movies wasn't worth it then this release is perfect for you. Not only will you get the first three movies youll get the extended versions of each featuring deleted scenes from the films original releases. Best of all will be the price which runs about the same as each movie costs when originally released and on sale.

The first film TWILIGHT introduces us to the main characters, in particular Edward, Bella and Jacob, a love triangle that tops most. Why? Because Edward is a vampire, Jacob a werewolf and Bella a human being who feels deeply for both but has a more deep rooted love it seems for Edward. The love story found here resulted in fans choosing sides of either Team-Edward or Team-Jacob battling it out online with one another throughout the run of the series of films. This movie was the one that started it all and a great way to find out not only what its all about but if you will enjoy the rest or not.

The second film, NEW MOON, carried on the story of the three. With Edward having gone away this left Bella longing for him with such an extreme display of emotions that for me it went overboard. I tired quickly of the moaning, crying and screaming that left her an emotional mess. But eventually things changed and the two reunite. No, that isn't a spoiler since we know there were three more movies to follow. It did add new complications to their story though.

ECLIPSE, the third film in the series and contained here brought things from the first season back again. As Bella finally makes the decision of just who she wants to spend her future with, Edward or Jacob, a vampire from the first film returns with revenge in mind. As more and more murders occur in the area the trio knows a confrontation is coming. A final battle between bad vampires facing off against a combination of vampires and werewolves make this one pretty exciting at the end. It also sets up the last movies in the series, the split movies of BREAKING DAWN PARTs 1 & 2.

So why weren't the last two included here? My guess is to promote sales of those two DVDs or the Complete Saga set. At the same time for the price this set is offered it makes for a nice introduction that makes buying the final films worth their price as well. If youve not jumped on the TWILIGHT bandwagon or hesitated in buying the movies this is a good point to jump on. It seems hard to believe its been 3 years since the last was released and amazing how quickly fans have jumped off for the most part to new series. That being said this makes it easy to discover or rediscover at an affordable price.",1445904000,,3335,4.378029079159935

4907160,3,B005Z7BNJA,"You say you haven't had enough of Edward and Bella? You need more of Jacob Blacks pecs in your life? You prefer glittering fangless vampires to the nasty, messy, and unattractive ones found in 30 Days of Night? Summit Entertainment heard your cries and fulfills yours deepest wishes with The Twilight Saga Extended Editions.

The Twilight Saga Extended Editions includes Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. Dont ask me why they didn't throw in Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2. Part 1 already has an extended edition and wouldve been rather painless for the studio to include. Why didn't they just piece together an extended version of Part 2 and make this release a fans ultimate dream package? Well probably never know.

Twilight features 4 extra minutes of romance and drama. New Moon is extended from 130 minutes to 137 minutes. Eclipse is bumped up from 124 minutes to 129 minutes. Basically, you're buying all 3 movies again for 16 minutes of added footage. If you're one of the legions of enthusiasts who adore this franchise, itll be worth every penny.

The Twilight Saga Extended Editions come together in one regular sized Blu-ray amaray case. Its pretty darn nice when it comes to storage. The new packaging sure beats the heck out of the bulky Twilight Forever behemoth. Theres only one problem: it doesnt include either of the Breaking Dawn movies or the special features! If you're a completist, you have to find space on your shelf for both sets.

Let me jump up on my soap box for a minute now. Although The Twilight Saga does send some negative messages to girls out there, it also has some good ones I enjoyed seeing as well. Bella is weak and way too obsessed with a guy to the point that she will do anything for him. It makes her sort of pathetic. However, I did appreciate the fact that Edward and Bella kept from having pre-marital sex in a day when not much thought is put into giving yourself away to anybody who comes along. Even though its not part of the set, I liked the fact that Bella wouldnt kill her baby in Breaking Dawn, which directly or indirectly (if you ask Director Bill Condon) promoted pro-life.

If you can settle for just the first three movies with no special features in one handy set and already have the Breaking Dawn Blu-rays, The Twilight Saga Extended Editions will satisfy you. Im one of the ten guys on the planet Earth that actually like this series and I was a bit annoyed when I received it not to see all the movies included. Some folks might feel like they're being taken advantage of after buying the movies multiple times by now.

I gave the movies 3 stars because the set is missing the extended editions of ""Breaking Dawn"" Parts 1 and 2.

4907187,1,B005Z7BNJA,"Mix together random ingredients of Anne Rice and Anita Blake, add a dollop of wretched writing, and finish with a vacuous, passive heroine who serves as the fans' stand-in.

This is the winning formula for the ""The Twilight Saga (Twilight / New Moon / Eclipse),"" a ridiculously overhyped series chronicling the overwrought romance of a century-old vampire and a completely ordinary teen girl. It's the stuff of a thousand teenage girls' fan-fiction fantasies, complete with wretchedly wooden acting and all the excitement of a wet squib.

""Twilight"" introduces us to Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), a stone-faced plain-Jane who moves to the rainy town of Forks. But then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who is hot, rich, and plays the ""stay away from me because I'm dangerous"" seduction card. Eventually Bella figures out the bleeding obvious: Edward is a vampire with sparkly skin and a ""vegetarian"" diet.

But their budding relationship is thrown into turmoil when an evil vampire decides to hunt Bella, and draws her into a dangerous trap. Then things get even worse in ""New Moon"" when Edward and his family depart Forks, and Bella starts doing dangerous sports that allow her to hear Edward's voice, when she isn't hanging out with hunky werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). But a mistaken vision leads Edward to believe Bella is dead -- and soon HE might be if Bella doesn't stop him.

Of course, in ""Eclipse"" the werewolf and vampire vie for Bella's attentions, apparently because she's just SO desirable that no one could live without her. Even as an old enemy attacks the vampires of Forks with an army of vampire newborns, and the vampires and werewolves must band together to protect one utterly useless human girl... we still have time for relationship issues!

The ""Twilight"" series is a perfect example of a plotless, drippy teen romance that likes to think it's actually an epic story (hence the ""saga"" description). Pretty much everything in the story revolves around a contrived love triangle that is never really believable to begin with -- especially since it demands that we believe that all teenage boys are attracted to Bella Swan.

Admittedly it does insert some awesome vampire action scenes that were never in Stephenie Meyer's tiresome books, such as the butt-kicking finale of ""Eclipse."" But this can't disguise the fact that the entire story revolves around tiresome angst -- everyone mopes, whines, moans, and occasionally gets suicidal. And the dialogue is so ridiculously overwrought that it becomes uproariously funny. Consider: ""This is the skin of a killer, Bella!"", which is such an absurd line that you can almost see Pattinson cracking up.

Kristen Stewart is perfectly cast as Bella Swan -- which is to say that the character is bland, inexpressive, pretentious and a mass of irritating tics like pawing at her hair and sighing through her front teeth. It's hard to see why she's supposed to be so irresistible, except that her plain nondescript appearance allows teen girls to imagine themselves in her place as a more attractive, dynamic actress could not have.

Robert Pattinson and a mass of gelled hair give little energy to his performance as the bipolar, controlling Edward Cullen, and he always looks like he's counting the seconds until he can escape the franchise. And Lautner, bless him, is trying his hardest to make the most likable (read: least stalkerish) of the three characters come to life, but his mediocre performance is smothered under the movie's thick blanket of awkward romance.

""The Twilight Saga (Twilight / New Moon / Eclipse)"" is best appreciated with large quantities of alcohol and a bunch of like-minded friends, so you can riff the pretentious romanticism for hours on end. Otherwise, avoid like the sparkly plague.",1363996800,2,3791,5.07223113964687

4907207,2,B005Z7BNJA,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. When I got my purchase and opened it, I felt deceived. The picture led me to believe this was a box set. This is not all the seller's fault. Amazon put this item under a search for ""box sets"", I should have read their description better. But the picture provided for this item is not the actual item I purchased. It is some type of collage, or something, of all the movies. I feel like I paid about 18 USD dollars for each DVD. That is way more than I would have paid at my local Target. Because this purchase was so bad I ended up buying a DVD to replace this one. Target had a promotional movie with postcards and stuff in it, which was more like what I expected I would get from this seller. I wanted my daughter to have a good Christmas present and this item wasn't it and I would have known that if they had used a picture of the actual item. At first I wasn't going to give feedback but Amazon sent me an email reminder so here I am. Maybe those reminders aren't such a good idea all the time.
