8119801,5,B000FAKV8G,"What a pleasant surprise! This series was hard to find on DVD but is a delight to my school age children. The action is not very realistic or particularly well-animated, but somehow the whimsical stories come across as very compelling. The themes of independence, bullying, and seamy side of public education are interesting to children. The humor is great, and this particular window into the somewhat overexposed Richler family is bright and sunny.",1185926400,,450,5.178082191780822
