7893681,5,6305753032,The second series builds on the original series and introduces young new heroes.  Unlike some series where everyone never ages.  The way the characters are handle remind me of the dragonlance novels.  Playing the opening and closing credits everytime is overkill though...,1050969600,,272,5.428571428571429
7893682,3,6305753032,"Plot: The bad guys are trying to destroy Lodoss, and once again Parn, Deedlit and Kashue must stop them, but this time with some new help. In comes Spike, Leaf, Little Neese and others to help save Lodoss.
My thoughts: It's.... ok. Very much like a role-playing game. The opening song and opening sequence is excellent, if only the rest of the show was as good. Spike has cool hair, and I like elves. Neese looks one way at first, then all of a sudden is drawn a different way. I've seen the first 7 (of 9) tapes, but the show hasn't given me much interest to watch the other two. The dub is bad, and I like dubbed anime. The redeeming quality? The ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" SD shorts between the episodes are wonderful, very funny and well done. I wish you could buy just that part.",1037577600,,784,4.304054054054054
7893683,5,6305753032,I don't get why so many people dislike this series. Its really good I think the main problem people have with it is the continuity from the OVA and the shift of focus to different characters. (Parn and Deedlit lose personality and Orson and Shiris suddenly gain some...) As for the Welcome to Lodoss Island bits at the end of the episodes they are really cool and only once did I think that they took away from the dramatic impact of a story ( It was after when you know who died...) anyways this is really a solid series and I would have to say that I really enjoyed it and for those of you who must absolutly insist on continuity I would try to stress this as an alternate timeline or universe. Anyways if you like Lodoss or Anime I would definitly purchase this item....,979257600,6,773,4.301369863013699
7893684,3,6305753032,Problems - It's WAY too long... this is like two series run together... Editing it into two films would have made much more sense. There are two different styles of animation here. As a movie we would also thus lose the goofy anime at the end of each episode. The characters also fail to recognise each other from the previous series... I think this is a failure of the movie makers and not the original Manga... For Lodoss fans the animation is comparable to the original series... you'll see the characters of old and a lot of new ones... there is plenty of back story and history and character development to keep fans tuned in. It also bridges the story of what happened between Record of Lodoss War and the Legend of Crystania the movie and the short series... which is good for fans of Ashram and the dark Elf... This should be condensed on to DVD as Record of Lodoss War was... it would be easier to wade through and enjoy with both English and Japanese dialog. Now if they would animate the Grey Witch Manga!,971136000,,1016,4.438502673796791
7893685,1,6305753032,"Be sure you buy ""Record of Lodoss War"" the six tape set first.  Then decide on this one.  I'd say stay away from it.  Complete disregard  for the original story breaks up any continuity; Deedlit is a filler  character with no true importance; the new characters seem a bit shallow as  compared to the old; and there is an added segment called ""Welcome to  Lodoss Island"" that is extremely silly and goofy, which takes away  from the serious story that the original series became cheered for.  Chronicle of the Heroic Knight is a butchering of what Record of Lodoss War  is.  Stay away from this, stick to the original 6 volume series.",965606400,2,634,4.571428571428571
7893686,1,6305753032,Inferior animation to Lodoss War- characters totally out of sync with original series - don't even recognize each other! - What a shame - Why not follow the original series?  Record of Lodoss War was a winner - this  series is not!  I highly suggest renting before buying....,957571200,3,275,4.6875
7893687,5,6305753032,"This is the whole shibang - the entire Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight series dubbed in English - and it rocks! The great voice acting and intriguing plot will keep you watching this series again and again...maybe even right after you just finished watching it like me. The  art quality is very good and the characters all stand out well - each with  their own personality attributes. The collection costs ()less also  by buying the set, which is good because buying 9 or 10 cassettes can be  tedious and more expensive. Parn, Deedlit, Shiris, Orson, Ashram, and  others all return from the original '91 series, ""The War of  Heroes"", and (even though Ashram and Orson have new voices) the series  has kept its captivating touch with twice as many episodes as the original.  After just the first 4, I already bought this nice collection which has  hooked me - and should hook you on quite-possibly the best anime ever...If  you don't own the whole series you're missing out on alot - it's actually  worth the buy.",956102400,4,1024,4.696629213483146
