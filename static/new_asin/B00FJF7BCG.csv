8616054,1,B00FJF7BCG,"I am not sure what happened, but the movie I received WAS NOT Canela.  I teach middle school and was prepared to have my students watch it today, but could not because it contained inappropriate (sexual in nature) content.  It included previews from several movies and cartoons (which they caught a glimpse of) and I could not fast forward through it.  I will be returning it and expect a refund.",1464652800,2,396,4.628571428571429

8616057,5,B00FJF7BCG,This is such a perfect movie for my spanish class. I have used it with 7th-12th grade Spanish classes and it has been a hit. It is a sweet movie and easy to follow for beginning spanish speakers. I use subtitles for beginners or remove them for intermediate learners.,1433721600,7,267,4.469387755102041

8616059,4,B00FJF7BCG,"I loved this movie, but before you buy, know that this DVD does NOT have subtitles.  I wanted to show this to my beginning Spanish students but they need English subtitles to understand everything.  Just an FYI - on netflix this movie has subtitles (SP or ENG).
It is a good movie that highlight the traditional way of making Mole.  It goes well with a food unit for Spanish language learners.",1396569600,11,393,4.507042253521127
