8133909,5,B000GQLA70,"The topic of ultrasonic facials was new to me, but I try to remain on the cutting edge as an esthetician. The spa that I manage has a growing client base, and as a result we have been looking into what services to add.

I've seen videos by this company before, so I knew that when I was considering ordering ultrasonic facial equipment, this would be a go-to resource for deciding if this type of service might appeal to my clients based on the way that they instructor shows the process in the video.

This was professionally made and incredibly helpful.  The instructor is always thorough and in depth and answered my questions (obviously without knowing them) which shows that she is an intuitive teacher and has a great understanding of what things other professionals in this field might wonder.

This has allowed me to provide another facet of service to my clients. The exfoliation, deep pore cleansing, and other possibilities of these services have been incredibly helpful.",1424649600,2,982,4.8273809523809526
8133910,5,B000GQLA70,"This was a very educational experience! Malinda was fun to watch, and this really helped with my esthetician training.

The people I work on really like the deep pore cleansing. The ultrasonic facial helps smooth the skin and make it glow.

Skin rejuvenation is discussed at length, and I'm better able to help get rid of people's acne.

I'd recommend this DVD to any esthetician or skin care worker. c:",1419120000,,403,4.728571428571429
8133911,5,B000GQLA70,"Thank you so much for this DVD. This has given me so much more insight to any other videos I have seen. As a professional skin care specialist I do like to see other peoples techniques and variations such using a sonic spatula for deep pore cleansing, light exfoliation and product penetration. This course of techniques for ultrasonic facials would be ideal for students, as a refresher for professionals or even those that want to learn from home.",1419120000,,449,4.769230769230769
8133912,5,B000GQLA70,"This is a two disc set and excellent value for money, better than any class on the subject. The instructor Malinda (who is a qualified aesthetician)  demonstrates two types of technologies. One of them just penetrates product into the skin while the other  the sonic spatula penetrates and exfoliates the skin. The video is easy to follow and discussed in detail across many subject matters, including the science of ultrasound and how it compares to other cosmetic options. Without hesistation I recommend ths dvd to any aesthetcian or skin care specialist.",1415232000,,558,5.1208791208791204
