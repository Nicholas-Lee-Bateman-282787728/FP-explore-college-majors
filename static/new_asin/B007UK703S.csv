8521958,5,B007UK703S,My sister is battling cancer and said she really enjoyed trying this DVD.  She made it sound like it wasn't too overwhelming for her to try as she is weak from treatment.,1453334400,,170,4.3125
8521959,5,B007UK703S,"This was very informative DVD for me who had a lung removed 6 years ago, the moves are very good.",1435449600,,97,3.9
8521960,5,B007UK703S,"I loved watching Carol Michael's video for stretching the upper body.  I'm a CPT and recently became a Cancer Exercise Specialist, who works with a group of breast cancer survivors in a group exercise class twice each week.  The video gave me some great input for our classes.  I will refer to this video often.",1401753600,,311,4.618181818181818
8521961,5,B007UK703S,"The video is excellent for helping those who are recovering from cancer surgeries of the upper body.  The stretching exercises start very simply with the upper body only, and then become more involved with stretching the whole torso too.  The 1/2 hour video also has very relaxing music while the instructer gives guidance.",1372377600,,323,5.0754716981132075
8521962,5,B007UK703S,"I had a double mastectomy and tram flap reconstruction for breast cancer, and after surgery had extreme tightness in my chest, abdomen and shoulders. I did some physical therapy at the hospital, but was not nearly ready to return to a gym or regular exercise class. I think there is a huge gap in cancer surgery recovery between the little bit of information you get at the hospital or PT, and real life. Somebody recommended Carol's program to me, and I found that Carol has developed a program to specifically fill this void. I took classes with Carol over several months to learn how to improve my range of motion, get relief from the uncomfortable tightness, and basically improve my quality of life. This DVD is a direct companion for the exercises Carol taught in her studio, and I am very happy to have it at home with me to continue the stretching. Stretching and exercise is a life-long committment after this type of surgery, and I found Carol's program extremely beneficial. I am glad that she has brought her expertise and unique program to DVD so that everyone can benefit from it, even if they are not able to work with her in person. I highly recommend the DVD.",1362355200,,1176,4.604761904761904
8521963,5,B007UK703S,"I suggested this DVD to a friend who was very appreciative and had the following comments:  ""This is a very helpful and unique rehabilitative DVD. The exercises are very easy to follow even without having prior experience with an exercise program. The stretching alleviates  pain and allows for greater flexibility.  An added benefit is that the combination of the narrarator's soothing voice, along with the stretching greatly reduces  anxiety.""",1357516800,,446,5.420289855072464
8521964,5,B007UK703S,"My friend  was recently diagnosed with BC so I got this DVD with the hope that it would help her regain her mobility -  the exercises  helped her flexibility and discomfort following surgery.  Immediately after surgery,she  was not able to lift her arm more
than shoulder height.  SHe now has regained  full range of motion.  The instructions in the DVD  are easy for anyone
to follow-even someone who has never stretched.  The stretches can de done while sitting or even in bed.  I highly recommended this DVD",1355702400,2,510,4.747126436781609
8521965,5,B007UK703S,I am a former client of Carol's.  This dvd helps me maintain the stregnth in my arm post mastectomy. I enjoyed my classes with Carol. When I do the dvd I feel like I am in class with her. You will always need to exercise your arm an this is an excellent dvd to use.  It is very simple to follow.  You will feel like Carol is in the room with you.,1354406400,3,346,3.7777777777777777
8521966,5,B007UK703S,"Recovery Fitness cancer exercise program is excellent.
It gives me all the stretches I need to make a full recovery of my strength and balance.  After using the DVD for just 1 week I am now able to move my arm, I have less pain and I am not so stiff.
The DVD is useful for cancer patients or others that have just had upper body surgery, arthritis, MS or Parkinsons.
  It is a gentle exercise program.  I really liked that the stretches are so simple and easy to follow. They are fun to do and loosened me up very quickly. Carol explains everything so clearly and  with a very soothing style.  It is all about getting back to what you did prior to surgery. I also like that I can go at my own pace and pick and choose the stretches I enjoy doing.
  I hope that there will be additional  DVDs. As soon as I restore my flexibility I would like to build up my strength.  I am so happy that I bought this DVD.  I need to exercise at home and this DVD makes it possible.",1336608000,,965,4.052910052910053
