5466362,4,B00APW2U88,"I bought this because I couldn't find a box set that included the 6th movie ANYWHERE in the U.S. Great quality, all movies play on my Blu-Ray. The ultraviolet codes though, are NOT redeemable in the us. kind of a bummer",1394582400,35,219,4.365853658536586

5466366,4,B00APW2U88,"In order rating each of these movies I would give the original(The Fast and the Furious) a 7.2 out of 10. 2 Fast 2 Furious would get a 6.5. Tokyo Drift was pretty bad and that's all on that. Fast and Furious would get a 7.2. Fast and Furious 5 was the best and would get a 7.6. Fast and Furious 6 gets a 7.1. Pretty much all of these movies are really solid besides Tokyo. If you like over tripped cars and with that a lot of close call driving action, then you will enjoy these movies.",1390953600,3,486,3.9693877551020407

5466370,5,B00APW2U88,"The movies themselves are as expected, so I will review the actual case/packaging that the movies come in. I love that the dvds come in a case that resembles a tire and has the F&F logo on it. Inside, the dvds are stacked within, separated by a thin layer of styrofoam like padding. The only downside is that all dvds are stacked on top of each other so to get to the one on the bottom you have to remove them all; but, as long as you properly handle the dvds then there is no issue. My set was received without any damage, and to this day, I am still pleased with my purchase.",1515801600,,577,4.0701754385964914

Though these films have gotten cheesier after Fast and Furious (the 4th one were Paul Walker drives the Subaru) i still love them.
You get all the films up to Furious 6. All on individual discs. the 6 discs are divided among 2 boxes, and the set up is flawless.

Only real con:
The DVD version of 2Fast 2Furious had a setting in the menu where you could select who's car you wanted to ""drive."" basically it had a 3 different main menus depending on which car you selected (The pink Honda s2000. Brian's yellow Evo, and the purple GTS Eclipse). It seems cheesy (and rice) now but it was a feature i loved as a kid.",1450137600,,704,4.214814814814815

5466727,5,B00APW2U88,"Our family loved this series, we are awaiting anxiously for tomorrow for the new Fast & Furious 7.  We were late in learning about these movies as we aren't typically a car racing fan but we got to see Vin Diesel in The Pacifier and found him funny and endearing.  We also became fans of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson with his movies The Tooth Fairy, The Game Plan, and Journey 2, the Mysterious Island.  We did get to see Paul Walker in the movie She's all that, he plays a mean character so wasn't really a fan.  But as we rode shotgun through the first movie we were instant fans and enjoyed the ride we went and rented the rest of the series.  My husband loved it and the girls enjoyed it so I purchased the series for our family movie nights.  Thanks",1442188800,,751,4.216783216783217

The disks come with cool bonus features and the 5th movie comes in theatrical and extended versions. I highly reccomend for any F&F fan. The price is a good deal as well.

5466788,5,B00APW2U88,"Purchased this set as a Deal of the Day with an additional $5 off if you pre-purchase Furious 7.  My set is the dual Blu-Ray clamshell cases each contains 3 movies. 1 to 3 and 4 to 6.  The Ultraviolet codes worked and 5 and 6 are the Extended Edition.  All the discs played flawlessly and sounded great. As I finished up Fast & Furious 6 I really liked how the series progressed and I had a better appreciation for this franchise.  I watched them in order and feel it might be the best way to do so to get a better understanding of the characters and how they are all connected.  I will admit the 1 was ok and 2 a bit weak but once I watched the entire series 1 and 2 seemed better as I got to know the characters better. The action and budget get better as the series progresses and 5 and 6 are tops. I loved the introduction of Wayne Johnson in 5. He is a great foil to Vin Diesel.  The progression of the series from the first film in 2001 to Furious 7 in 2015 is an interesting study in acting styles and the extras on each disc add to the enjoyment of following how this series has progressed and became a passion for all of the cast and crew. Though I am looking forward to watching Furious 7 when the disc is released I will be saddened watching Paul Walker in his last film.

The soundtrack and music in each movie just adds to the enjoyment.  I recommend watching the entire series to fully appreciate how they all tie together.",1438300800,,1437,4.125448028673835

The Fast and The Furious (aka Point Break 2.0, with cars instead of surf boards).  Enjoyable movie all around, no super ridiculous stunts compared to the others.  8/10

Two Fast Two Furious.  I'm biased on this one, my younger brother and I watched it a lot and loved quoting it.  Set in Miami, now Bryan is a street racer turned mole rather than a mole turned street racer.  Introduction of his buddy Roman Pierce - probably due to Vin Diesel wanting too much money - but still a hilarious character.  Overall this definitely had the lightest feel to any of the movies.  They're smiling and joking around most of the time, and even when they're in danger it's in beautiful Florida weather.  9/10.  Got any more reviews up in there?  We hungry.

Tokyo Drift.  This one just seemed like a silly knockoff.  Everyone hates on it compared to the others, but how bad is it really?  It's pretty bad.  We enjoyed making fun of the stuff they do more than the actual movie.  4/10.  Han was pretty cool, so he's at least 3 of those 4 points.  The other point was for the humor of listening to this Texas ""high schooler"" with a thick accent saying ""What's DK stan' for?  Dawnkey Kawng?""

Fast and Furious.  The sweet return to our beloved Paul and Vin.  This movie all around just seemed darker than its predecessors and because of that wasn't quite my favorite, but it was well done.  The driving did start to get pretty ridiculous, but it was still a good movie overall.  7/10.

Fast Five.  Holy laws of Physics Batman!  But for real, this was actually my favorite of all of them.  The Rock was both hilarious and badass.  ""Got some good news and some bad news"" - ""You know I like my dessert first"".  The entire crew comes back for this one, and while the whole thing could have been avoided if Vin wasn't an idiot and told Mia to steal the GT40 for no reason at all (why Dom, why?) it was very entertaining.  The fight between Vin and the Rock was awesome.  The scene with the dragging of the bank vault could work if the vault and the chains carrying it were made of adamantium maybe, but we'll let that slide in the interest of entertainment.  10/10

Fast & Furious 6.  I haven't watched this one yet since theaters, but my initial impression was that it was pretty good.  Had somewhat of a darker feel the same as #4, and the chase scenes were hilariously inaccurate (was that runway 24 miles long?) but that's what you get with these movies and if you don't like the lack of Physics, go watch Cosmos. 7/10",1436745600,2,2701,4.377777777777778

5466888,5,B00APW2U88,"Movies were  great as usual. Everyone here thought the packaging was really cool. A seemingly real tire holding all the discs !! THEN reality sinks in !! All the discs are piled one on top of each other on a spindle, separated by a thin round piece of circular foam. You want to see the 4th movie ??  First you have to take the tire out of the box(You have to basically leave the tire in the box it came in or tire could roll off shelf) Then unscrew the tire, then pull the first 4 movies off the spindle (  you have to flip the bottom half of the tire upside down to remove the movies and careful ...watch for fingerprints) Then rest the 1st 3 movies somewhere so you can play #4. Not TOO much of a pain in the ass, is it ? Absolutely NO description of ANY of the movies ANYWHERE in this set. You really have to know what each movie is about to pick one out to play . I really regret selling my old separate box set ( 4 of the movies were reg DVD's). Also there was a box cutter slash down the back of the box (through the shrink wrap too) but it didn't affect the tire.",1434067200,,1071,3.949074074074074

It even got me interested in cars. The collection itself is a great addition. The case is like a cd case but in the form of a tire with the series name in the rim. I just wish it came with a stand or something because I want to sit it standing up. The case also has a spot for the recent movie that is yet to come out.

While the Wheel, complete with a space for the upcoming volume 7 is great looking and does the job, it is a bit difficult to maneuver the discs from one to the next.  On the other hand, it does not distract from the quality of the movies themselves.  The ability to sit and watch the story develop from one movie to the next is a real bonus and, I must admit that having an open spot for the upcoming movie is a real plus.  The edition I got, to my surprise contained the extended editions of films five and six, another bonus.

It looked like someone ran sandpaper or something over it.  Horrible! I tried cleaning the outer edge to get the gunk off and tried to fix the scratches, but no luck!  Will not play at all.  Money wasted.  Nice case.  Maybe I will use it to hold sand paper .  I am so angry right now, it is beyond words!  These are supposed to be brand new?",1427414400,,612,3.816

5467201,5,B00APW2U88,"I actually came to this series really late, the first film I saw was ""Fast 5"", and I was hooked immediately. I went back watched them all, and I have to say that they are so much fun, I'm sorry it took me so long to give these films a try.

""The Fast and the Furious"" - An undercover cop infiltrates the street racing scene in hopes of stopping a group of racers that have been hijacking tractor trailers full of electronic equipment. A pumping soundtrack, some amazing stunt driving and a great cast of characters get this series off on the right foot.

""2 Fast 2 Furious"" - This may be the weakest entry in the series, but if you just want to watch pretty people driving fast to a thumping soundtrack, then it's still a fun ride. Brian from the first film and his ex-con buddy Roman agree to work with the local customs agents to bring down a drug kingpin.

""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" - A problem child is sent to live with his father in Tokyo after a destructive street race. He discovers a new kind of racing called drifting where it's not about speed but about maneuvering your car through a series of tight turns. He finds trouble when the girl he likes has ties with the Yokuza. Imagine ""The Karate Kid"" using cars instead of karate.

""Fast & Furious"" - Brian and Dom are both on the trail of the man who killed one of their crew, and the search leads both men to a mysterious drug lord living in Mexico. The cartel uses fast drivers to move their product from Mexico into the US, and Dom and Brian use their skills behind the wheel to infiltrate the cartel.

""Fast 5"" - The movie opens at the closing scene of the previous film. Both Brian and Dom are on the run in Brazil when they find themselves caught between a crime lord and an unstoppable DEA agent. This is the film where the series really hits it's stride. Adding Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to the mix, and getting a big time heist this go round really amps up the stakes of the whole franchise.

""Fast & Furious 6"" - As the film opens we see Brian and Dom racing down a twisty highway in Spain to the hospital as Brian's son is being born. Dom and his crew are offered a chance of full pardons if they will help the DEA track down and catch a former Special Ops soldier and his crew before they can build a machine that can take out the power of an entire nation.

I think that what I really like about most of these films are the practical stunts. There are scenes where your jaw will drop and you can't help but get engaged. Sure it's over the top, and cheesy, and the dialogue is often corny as hell.....but I love it!! You really get to like and care for these characters, and the continuity is a lot of fun for fans. They weave familiar and former characters in and out of each film, and it's always fun to see familiar characters pop up here or there in the various films.

Pop some corn, pop in these movies and just sit back and enjoy.",1427414400,36,2923,4.216457960644007

5467207,5,B00APW2U88,"I just got my Fast & Furious 1-6 limited edition set today and I love it! I had the same set for the first five movies (and I will probably get it again,or whatever special packaging they do, when they release 7). I love the fact that they packaged it as a tire. The differences between the set for the first five movies and this one are for 1, the set for just the first five movies has an extra disc for each movie for a digital version. In the new set they give you codes to go on a website to get the digital downloads. So the discs aren't crowded in the container because there are less of them. The new pack also leaves room so you can add Fast 7 when it comes out on disc. It actually comes with a cardboard disc behind the last blu ray disc that says on it ""This space is reserved for Fast 7 coming 2015"". As far as the movies and the content, I'm a huge fan of the Fast & Furious franchise and the blu rays didn't disappoint. They all come with extras...which I love. And there's a bonus disc of stuff to preview Fast 7. If you are a fan of the franchise I definitely recommend this. But...they probably will be making another limited edition set when 7 comes out...and it will probably have some sort of Paul Walker tribute (which is why I will be getting that one too). So I guess its up to your preference on if you want to wait or not.",1426982400,32,1348,4.052434456928839

I was aware of that before I bought this set and I still give this collection FIVE (5) STARS easily. There is a fantastic storyline in this series with a thread about the importance of family. This has many twist and turns with people unexpectedly switching sides throughout this collection. But my number one reason for enjoying this series is the action, especially the hand to hand combat is awesome. There are power hand fights and finesse hand fights. There are gun fights, car chases, explosions, air plane and tank sequences with some imaginative stunt scenes. There is zero nudity and little if any F bombs in the whole collections.",1424908800,,753,4.712121212121212

But for those that have followed the franchise and bought the bluray movie from the beginning, I would wait until the entire franchise is over to buy a set; that is, if you want to either replace, or just to have a collector's set of the entire franchise separately.  They are going to have part 8 and 9, so that would make this collector's set incomplete.",1421625600,12,412,4.2025316455696204

5467289,1,B00APW2U88,"Enough with the stupid, fancy packaging.  I have custom built shelves that hold my DVDs and BDs.  I spend a lot of money on these movies and I want them protected, not sticking out collecting dust or shoved in a storage box somewhere else.  If the marketing department actually used the products it designed, it would know that this crap packaging is just something that ends up in our landfills and forces us to buy regular cases to protect these movies.

Let's say I want to watch the third movie.  Instead of popping open the case and flipping the trays for instant access to the movie, I have to slide a wheel out of this eyesore without dropping it.  Then I unscrew the fancy wheel and balance my stack of movies on the edge of my player as I sort through the pile, trying to find my target movie.  As I put the movies back in the wheel, one by one, I notice that I now have fingerprints all over the disc, as well as a few scratches, from trying to get them in and out of the container.

I bought another multi-season series recently and had to do this each time I wanted to watch the next disc in the 25 disc series.  It gets old.  Get a clue, Marketing Department.  We want to watch our movies, not spend time juggling them.",1421452800,18,1232,4.244635193133047

It comes in 2 bluray cases with 3 movies each in a sturdy sleeve
The only problem I had was 3 out of the 6 codes couldn't be redeemed, but I contacted VUDU about it and I'm waiting for the response (will share the answer later)

- I had to sent a picture of my voucher with the codes first, and this was the answer from VUDU
""I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble redeeming your digital copies. After testing your codes, they are all coming up Valid. You will have to go to the web site listed on the card: www.universaldigitalcopy.com Once you are on this web site, you will be able to enter in your codes. Once entered, you will be asked which Streaming Service you would like to redeem the code for. If you choose Vudu, enter in your Vudu credentials. The titles will then be added. If you are still having trouble, please reach back out to us. Thank you and have a great day.""

And it worked! The problem was that the codes didn't correspond to the movie shown next to it (the codes for Fast Five were the codes for Fast & Furious and so forth), so check that out before contacting any service.",1419465600,9,1233,4.176470588235294
