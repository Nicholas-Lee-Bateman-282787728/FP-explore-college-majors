374952,3,6301901282,"After Dark, My Sweet Brooding Noir at Its Best
Reviewed by Bruce Cantwell (a-movie-to-see.com)
Kevin Collins (Jason Patric) is a shabby, seemingly slowwitted drifter who stumbles upon sultry, cynical Fay Anderson  (Rachel Ward), a regular at Bert's (Rocky Giordani) bar.
He tries to  strike up a conversation about his mythical traveling partner Jack  Billingsley but Bert wants none of it. Collins doesn't want to start  trouble, but he doesn't take kindly to getting booted out of a bar for no  good reason, so when Bert threatens to get physical, Collins puts him away  with a sharp blow to the face.
As Collins walks up the road, a car pulls  up beside him. Fay likes the way he handles himself. She wants to take him  home.
The best thing about James Foley's adaptation of the hard-boiled  Jim Thompson novel After Dark, My Sweet is its laser-like focus on this  fatal attraction.
From the way Collins looks at Fay when she walks into  the bar, we know that they're going to become involved, and from the tone  of the film, we sense that nothing good is going to come from it.
For all  of its inevitability, we're never quite sure exactly what is going to go  terribly wrong.
The film is remarkably sparse. Apart from Collins and  Fay, there are only two characters who have more than a handful of lines,  Uncle Bud (Bruce Dern), the ex-police detective on the make and Doc Goldman  (George Dickerson) the compassionate homosexual friend. The setting, dusty  dry and bleak.
With all of its detailed observation and deliberate  pacing, there isn't a wasted moment in the inexorable march toward tragedy.",961286400,4,1607,4.799270072992701

While, yes, some aspects might be implausible in today's world--for example, doubtful you'll find a doctor who will take into his home a homeless, troubled young adult--but it's the extraordinary acts that sometimes make an interesting story.  The events of the movie I think are quite plausible if you buy into the characters--and that's where the movie excels is in the actors' portrayals.  Jason Patric, in perhaps his most memorable role, plays ""Collie,"" a broken down, homeless, former boxer who meets up with ""Uncle Bud"" and ""Fay,"" who find in him the perfect guy to carry out their kidnapping plot and take the fall.  But he's not so dumb as they think, and how the story unfolds, and how Collie turns the tables on Uncle Bud, and in a way redeems himself for the sake of Fay and the kid--it is unforgettable and will stick with you long after the story is over.",1374278400,,1086,4.689473684210526

Then came Speed 2. And things came to a grinding halt.

But having just read the book, which has to be Thompson's shortest (and tightest) I again remember Patric's performance. In the category of Eric Roberts in Star 80 and Mickey Rourke in Barfly. Maybe it's time Tarantino and Patric got together.",1325635200,2,503,4.704545454545454
375046,5,6301901282,"Film noirs are tricky.  You either nail them or you fail, there is usually no happy medium.  Likewise, you either love them or you hate them.  A film noir is really all about style and that slick edge that comes from the right mood reflected off of the right sullen faces.  Some films try and reinvent the noir, with varying effects.  Some films simply pay homage to the great noirs of yesteryear in their construction.

`After Dark, My Sweet' is a nice example of the latter.

Instead of rewriting a genre, James Foley shows great finesse and deep respect for the course paved out for him decades before.  In his adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel, Foley creates a mood that is thick with emotional friction and works magic around the whole `place and time' vibe; getting into the heart of what makes a great noir thriller.

`After Dark, My Sweet' tells the story of Kid Collins, a former boxer and recent mental ward escapee who stumbles into a dusty town with a story to tell and no real ear to tell it to.  Then he meets, quite by strange circumstance, Fay Anderson, a wealthy widow cloaked in mystery.  Upon meeting her, Kid's whole world is set ablaze, especially when she introduces him to Garrett (or Uncle Bud as he is referred to).  Taken advantage of Kid's obvious mental state, both Fay and, more aggressively, Bud inform him of a kidnapping and ransom plot they want to use him for.  Being vulnerable (but not stupid) he accepts and conforms to what they want from him, willing to be used until it all starts circling in his head and ideas start forming and soon he's questioning everyone and trusting no one.

The basic idea within `After Dark, My Sweet' is that trust is foregone and really, no one is who they say they are.  Even the final frame will leave you questioning what true intentions and motives are, despite Jason Patric's monotone narration.

At the heart of `After Dark, My Sweet' is Foley's superb direction.  He really grasps the intentions of the genre and delivers a grounded film that just drips with style and a certain coldness that calls to mind David Lynch.  Every frame is beautifully shot, which is a signature component to the noir genre.  The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, and the editing here is flawless (you can feel each scene breath).  The mystery captured in this adaptation is also key, because the ambiguity of certain characters and pasts keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.  The performances are all rather great, especially Rachel Ward who just embodies her character's seductive manipulation marvelously.  As with nearly any good noir, you can feel the performance (this is the type of acting that is purposefully `acted' as opposed to intentionally naturalized) and that also lends a hand to the `style' intended to be seen.

If you are a fan of the genre then this is a film for you, but be forewarned; this is very much a noir film and if that particular breed of film is not up your ally then stay away.",1314748800,3,2996,4.621928166351607

375048,4,6301901282,"It is difficult to imagine that his film was made nearly 20 years ago.  Jason Patric plays a young man, former boxer who is emotionally damaged.  He hussles his way into people's lives and then simply runs away.  During one of his stints, he comes across beautiful woman, a widow, who offers him a shelter in exchange for some handy work around her house.

It does not take long before it is apparent that a woman and her friends have agenda on how to create enough wealth so they do not have to worry about the money during the old days.  They are about to use ex-boxer as a tool to get to the goal.  Erotic tension rises but so does desire for control.  No one seem to be what they pretend to be and that is when film truly reaches its peak.

Jason Patrick gives a fantastic performance.  He has a true swagger of a boxing champion.  His eyes reflect his mood of the moment.  At that point he taks over the big screen and the course of the movie.  It is one of the films made in film noir fashion that draws audiences into destinies of the protagonists.

Patric's only fault could be that he's a bit too pretty as he's a good actor and like others have said below it's a shame that he hasn't been seen in more films.  Rachel Ward makes a believable alcoholic femme fatale but I couldn't help but think of Jessica Lange playing the part as the role seems tailor-made for her.

Over-all this was a great little film, very film-noir, so much so that it almost seemed strange to be watching it in color, so it didn't surprise me at all to learn from the other reviews that the story was actually from a 50's pulp novel of the same name. I can't speak for the novel but in the films case this title doesn't fit at all but it's good to see that it's not being forgotten.",1199145600,2,834,4.238993710691824

Others have gone over the plot here so I will not do that. I will say that all actors did exceedingly well in what can be very difficult roles to play. They all acted off each other in a believable manner.

Bruce Dern was never seedier than he is with this character. Jason Patric and Rachel Ward also excel at thier characters.

What is decieving here is the setting....somewhere in the southwest, desert area. Film noir is typically dark and shadowy but here there is lots of sunlight. It takes the focus off the setting and puts it on the plot, which I found to be an interesting twist and quite effective.

In the heat, the emotions bubble over. Lust, greed, deception, lies, mistrust and paranoia all play out in layer upon layer and is accented by Jason Patric's character very effectively.

For those who like film noir with a twist you will certainly like this little known gem. It is immediately captivating and magnetic. I don't know how I missed it on it's original release but certainly glad I caught up to it. Take a chance folks... you won't be disappointed.",1171929600,16,1180,4.626794258373206
375083,4,6301901282,"Very nice piece of work with strong casting. How can you do better than have Bruce Dern play an ex-cop sleazeball? Or Rachel Ward as a dangerous femme fatale? Or Jason Patric as a semi-addled former boxer with smoldering sexuality?

Answer: you CAN'T. Yep, we're in Jim Thompson land--aka Desperation City, and each one of these three characters has some kind of desperation going on, as do just about all of Thompson's characters. This is neo-noir at its best; you reduce the story down to fundamental elements and have James Foley directing--a rock solid director--and you got yourself one humdinger of a flick.

So yeah, there's sex and violence and yeah, they both come out of Desperation. Oh yeah. The flashbacks of Patric (as Kevin Collins), a former boxer, when he was in the ring, add just the right element for cementing the story and its Thompsonesque flavor. So there's a planned heist and stuff, but the formula isn't important. What's important  is the atmosphere, the acting, the emotional punch on display. And it's definitely here.

Great piece of work. Go for it.",1158192000,11,1080,4.885245901639344
375084,4,6301901282,"Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern-day film noir a winner. Of the three, I don't know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters.

Patric does the narration in this noir, playing an ex-boxer and mental patient. Wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! He looks dumb, but he isn't. Ward is the slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co- conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad. Bruce Dern also is in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.

The movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating....and I don't like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of quirky crime film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well-done.",1146009600,4,917,4.7974683544303796

Patric falls desperately and hopelessly in love with Ward. In fact, everything in the movie, which is based on a Jim Thompson crime novel, appears desperate and hopeless - the characters, the situation, even the outcome. Patric sacrifices his life so Ward can escape punishment for the kidnapping, a noble jesture for sure, but a strain on credulity.

Jason Patric is excellent; he projects the raw physicality of a young Brando with just the right amount of modern psychotic edge. Rachel Ward is certainly beautiful enough to inspire many a man to do something dangerous and/or stupid( the sound of her husky voice alone would bring me to my knees!)  Bruce Dern, after too many yrs in semi-retirement, acts with such sleazy charm that i almost wished it were the 1970's again and he were in his full-on psycho mode.

Wanting to stay below the radar, Collins takes refuge with a woman that trades shelter for work.  The death of her husband has plummeted her into a world of alcohol and rage.  As Collins begins to build a relationship with her, she shares with him details of a kidnapping plan that her and her ""Uncle"" have been working on.  Thinking that Collins is nothing more than a mental lackey, they persuade him to help with the diabolical plan.  Little do they know that the monsters struggling inside Collins' mind are about to be unleashed onto the world.  As the plan begins to disintegrate before their eyes, loyalties are lost, and nobody can be trusted.

What an amazing find!  When I began watching this film I was not expecting to be so surprised.  Jason Patric is spectacular in this film and demonstrates powerfully his ability to control and maintain a troubled character.  I never once felt that he had stepped out of character during this performance.  This is due in part to the exceptional direction by James Foley that creates a story so imaginative and real that you begin to feel as if this could be a town next to yours.  Foley gives us flawed characters that take away that image of perfection and helps build deeper emotional ties.  Foley also never gives anything away.  Throughout this entire film, I never knew what was going to happen next.  This is surprising for a Hollywood notorious for ""jumping the gun"".

Patric's performance with Foley's direction coupled with a completely terrifying secondary characters (like Bruce Dern and Rachel Ward), After Dark My Sweet is a true diamond in the rough.

375088,4,6301901282,"Jim Thompson is one of the great pulp crime novelists of our time, and the film adaptations of his works are usually, but not always,  quite splendid.  This film, starring Jason Patric, Rachel Ward and Bruce Dern, is an underrated gem that's worth a look.  The look and feel of this movie is slightly like a David Lynch flick, in that it's a modern update of Thompson's work, most of which was written in the 40s and 50s, but it has a timeless retro feel, with certain elements that span so many different eras that you can't quite place what year the film takes place.  This flick stars Jason Patric as 'Kid' Collins, a former boxer who kills a guy in the ring and goes on the lam between periodic stays at mental institutions.  He ends up meeting Fay (Ward), a widow who takes a liking to him, and Uncle Buck (Dern) a sleazy con man with various crooked connections in many low places.  Patric is particularly outstanding.  He plays a scruffy, down on his luck drifter who's lost all hope and hardly even cares about much more than finding a place to sleep and eat for the night.  The Southwestern U.S. desert landscape lends itself well to films that convey a sense of isolation and loneliness and Patric embodies it here perfectly.  The guy is really good at playing dark troubled characters.  And Bruce Dern is right up there with Dennis Hopper when it comes to playing sleazeballs.  Uncle Buck hatches a scheme to kidnap a rich kid and tries to use Patric to help unfurl the scheme.  If I told you anymore, it would ruin all the twists and turns that this film takes.  The movie stays pretty faithful to Thompson's novel, which is a good thing beacuse whenever a director strays from Thompson's original work (like Peckinpah in 'The Getaway' or the film version of 'The Killer Inside Me' starring Stacy Keach) they usually miss the mark,  Thompson is so good at developing character that there's no real need to tamper with it.  There's so many great little scenarios in the movie and they all contribute to to the story's grittiness.  It's actually quite a quiet film, with a number of scenes played out in muted tones or silence, suggesting a disconnection from the outside world.  The film would probably be best described as melancholic, especially whne Patric starts to fall for the film's femme fatale, because you just KNOW that it's doomed before it's even began.  You try and stay unmoved when Patric breaks down and cries during the scene when he realizes Fay has left him.  Unfortunately, it's tough to talk about this film without giving too much away.  If you're a fan of understated, intelligent, well-paced little films, then this should be right up your alley.",1091923200,6,2682,4.641949152542373

Though its Southwestern locations (Indio, California was used) are both a bit too sparse and modern, in every other way this captures the ineffable aura of Jim Thompson's prose (and anyone who's actually READ ""The Getaway"" knows how utterly impossible a task translating his best effects to film really is). Director Foley has done a splendid job in setting a tone of dreamlike, sunburned melancholy and maintaining it throughout, aided immeasurably by fine performances by Rachel Ward & Bruce Dern and an absolutely riveting one by Jason Patric. I had faint hopes for this film before seeing it, largely because of Patric in the lead; I was floored watching it, and all DUE to Patric's performance. Though a little young for the part, he captures perfectly the likable ambivalence and roiling inner pathology of the Jim Thompson Hero: you never stop feeling for the guy even as you know he will inevitably be compelled by his inner torments to do monstrous things before the story ends. Patric's complete immersion into ""Kid Collins"" steals a little thunder from one of Bruce Dern's most chillingly indelible portrayals of slime personified, ""Uncle Bud"". (Fans of Dennis Hopper's ""Frank Booth"" from BLUE VELVET would take to Uncle Bud immediately, I think.)
More than any other film adaptation of Thompson, AFTER DARK -even more than THE GRIFTERS - embodies that peculiar cowtown existentialism of his that tells us we're each of us alone in a world where things start bad and only get worse, pretending we're sane the way kids pretend there's a Santa Claus. A film without an audience in 1990, but little by little, year by year, a growing and appreciative audience is building. See this movie.",1010102400,37,1880,4.859813084112149

When I see an actor I truly enjoy seeing in big-name movies (as Jason Patric was in The Lost Boys) I'm compelled for more - ultimately deciding that I find enjoyment in rummaging around for movies containing this actor that are either unpopular, virtually unheard of or forgotten about.

This movie was pretty boring. It has a dry atmosphere to it. As some reviews call this movie ""steamy"" - there is maybe about 3 or less minutes of hardly-graphic intimacy in this movie. In her own right, Rachel Ward is a great actress but I do not feel that she and Jason Patric clicked for this particular movie. Maybe if I watched it again I may feel a change of mind but honestly, in my opinion, everything about it EXCEPT Jason Patric is forgettable. I don't think I'll go searching for it again on Amazon but if I stumble upon it on a rainy day I may watch it again.

AFTER DARK, MY SWEET: Punch-drunk ex-boxer Kevin Collie Collins (Patric) stumbles into a dusty California desert town and is promptly picked up by beautiful, sarcastic widow Fay Anderson (Ward). She cleans him up; she gives him work; she lets him stay in a trailer out in her orchard. Enter sleazy Uncle Bud (Dern), who gives Collie some vague, sinister warnings. Even Fay advises splitting before he gets mixed up in their scheme. He cant stay away from Fay, though; shes the first person whos ever needed him.

Buds kidnapping plan is pretty simple, but even Collies addled brains can figure out hes being set up as the patsy; set up to take the fall. All he knows for sure is hes got to play this out to the end, and that he can add his own spin to the scheme, since they all underestimate him so badly. Is he crazy like a fox? Or just crazy?

Discussion: What distinguishes this movie from a standard thriller (which could easily be made from the simple plot) is its unusual point of view: We see situations through the eyes of a borderline lunatic, which fills the plot with unpredictable double- and triple-crosses, some of which might exist only in Collies fevered brain. Or perhaps Collies questionable sanity is simply simple-mindedness...but simplicity can be a very complicated thing. Uncle Buds mistake, and Fays as well, is in equating smarts with sanityor with character. Even though Collies brains might be scrambled, his insight into motivation is far more perceptive and accurate than that of any of the other players.

The flick wouldnt work without a brilliant central performance, and Patric pulls it off excellently. Every step his Collie takes is a prowl through the ring; every intuitive gesture is sound psychology. The movie is full of surprises, snowballing up to the ending, which contains one shocking twist after another; all logical, unpredictable and inevitableif youve got the mind of a killer.",1423180800,,2181,4.792553191489362

Jason Patric (one of the most undderated actors of his generation, I might add) gives what I think is his finest performance (with the exception of Rush and The Beast- two other great films I highly recomend). The film is this great blend of modern noir I highly, highly recomend this film- you won't be disappointed.",1416873600,6,532,4.383838383838384
