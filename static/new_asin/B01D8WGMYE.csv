8755176,5,B01D8WGMYE,"We left the Bay Area at around the time this documentary was produced, and we could see the changes happening right in front of us. On our last visit to the city where I was born, my wife remarked that she really had no desire to come back after. It was so crowded and when I saw a twenty-something driving around North Beach in a red Ferrari, I knew something was up. Alexandra Pelosi captured those changes in 2.0. To a fifth generation San Franciscan the changes are disturbing. No longer can working class families afford to live in the city, without significant hardship that degrades quality of life. Mayor Ed Lee by catering to tech companies has exacerbated the homeless problem which three years after this documentary was produced is worse than ever. San Francisco has strong progressive roots but you would not know it by how much effort goes into supporting the ultra rich versus the most disadvantaged. Years ago San Francisco forced blacks out of their homes in the Fillmore District and now black homeowners and renters are starting to be forced out of the Bay View/Hunters Point area.  Airbnb, headquartered in San Francisco, has changed neighborhhods from residential to commercial, and taken thousands of long term rental units off the market. More homeless on the streets and more cars looking for fewer and fewer parking spaces. Pelosi tackles her subject matter in a breezy style that is offputting at times given the serious issues involved.  San Francisco may now be considered a world class city, but in the process has become one mass gentrification project and lost much of its charm and liveability. For decades San Francisco was the home of the 49ers professional football team and had an extremely loyal following even in bad years. Tickets were affordable by the mainly working class fans. Children could get in the games free. All that started to change when outside ownership took over, and loyalty to San Francisco was secondary to marketing the team to a more elite clientle and relocating to Santa Clara. It you wanted to follow the team there, fans had to ante up a multi-thousand dollar seat license fee that most existing fans could not not afford. It wasn't the fans that wanted an expensive new stadium. They were perfectly happy with Candlestick Park, and reasonable ticket prices. The same process unfolded with the Giants professional baseball team, which now has some of the most expensive tickets in the country. While Ms. Pelosi could have spent more time talking about the mean streets of San Francisco, this is still an excellent documentary that deserves a followup: 2.0.1. Three years later and the problems presented in her documentary have only gotten worse.",1534809600,,2710,4.914847161572053
8755177,5,B01D8WGMYE,"I visited my old stomping grounds, S.F., last year and I was astonished at the changes I saw, even though I live in nearby Lake Tahoe. The Uber drivers filled me in about the tech companies fueling the forces behind the growth. It was as if a skyscraper had fallen from the sky and landed right on top of the club where I danced in my college days. I was sad with nostalgia, but dazzled by the glamour.

This film did a beautiful job telling the story behind the development. But it didn't seem so glamorous any more. There is a tremendous cost behind this gentrification. 4,000 plus families evicted from their homes. No place for artists, musicians, teachers and those first-responders that New York talks so lovingly about. San Francisco as we know it, is disappearing.. The film-maker does not point fingers, but the young techies themselves have some chilling quotes: ""There are no old people here..."" boasts one. Another talks about how their apps find ways to make everything better while circumventing unions, government regulation and taxes. To me, that is saying that they are excited to eliminates protection for workers, and rules regarding safety and fairness while avoiding paying for schools. roads and emergency services...among other things.
It's all about money. Scary.",1519171200,,1287,4.986046511627907
8755178,1,B01D8WGMYE,"If I didn't know any better, I would think that the intention of this bogus ""documentary"" is to serve as a deterrent for anybody who wants to move to San Francisco! I live in the heart of San Francisco, Mission District! I live and work among the ""Working Class"" of the City. You do not have to be wealthy or rich to live in San Francisco!

There is an organized & ""unorganized"" Apartment Rental Scam going on in SF to try to gouge uninformed & new arrivals to the City! The great irony of it all is that there are tons of VACANT Apartment Buildings all over the City! The reason being is that very greedy Landlords are holding out to rent them for exorbitant prices! Many of these Apartment Ownders/Landlords have been DEFAULTING on their Property (Apartment) Loans due to their evil greediness!

On the bright side, if you look right and take your time, you will find many decent and reasonable places to rent & live! The trick to live in San Francisco is to live very simple & pragmatic! All things are possible and all Cities, including San Francisco, are liveable and feasable!

Do not listen to naysayers and dissuaders! Don't let anybody dictate to you where you can live! I love San Fransico and San Francisco loves & welcomes everybody! You don't have to be rich to live in San Francisco!",1515801600,,1297,4.51063829787234
8755179,3,B01D8WGMYE,"This is a good example of gentrification and the short and long term impacts to the City. I think it also illustrates that elected official's actions have many intended and unintended consequences. San Francisco's Board of Supervisor's changed the course of the City believing that active encouragement and recruitment of the ""Tech Industry"" into San Francisco would be beneficial. Unfortunately, the Board's actions drove the value of housing in San Francisco into unaffordability by many who called San Francisco home. It discouraged and displaced many lower income individuals elderly, and young families. Young families cannot afford the higher priced housing, and has resulted in San Francisco having relatively few children proportionate to the City's population. It is a great example of poor policy development and implementation by two of San Francisco's Mayors (Gavin Newsom and Ed Lee) and the other elected members of the Board of Supervisors. The documentary was created by the daughter of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.",1487376000,2,1030,5.525316455696203

8755182,1,B01D8WGMYE,"I understand how easy it is to blame tech workers for housing prices in San Francisco but that is not the cause of the insane rental costs and  purchase prices. The artificially low interest rates that the Federal Reserve has maintained to inflate housing prices and increase the money supply is what is behind these record high rents and the homelessness that is accompanying it.

The tech business has been fueled by this increase in the money supply which is also driving them to make all this stuff we do not want and do not need. It too is a bubble.

To blame tech workers who in reality are handing over their paychecks to their landlords and the government for taxes is really shocking given that this is Nancy Pelosi's daughter. It really makes me wonder if politicians have any clue what reality is like.

This is the tax class that politicians and economists are taking aim at to tax even more, while simultaneously lowering taxes for corporations even more when corporate taxes have been going down for over 50 years.

This documentary is not even scratching the surface of what is really going on.",1477267200,7,1109,4.666666666666667
