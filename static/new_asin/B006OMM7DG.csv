8502095,5,B006OMM7DG,"First caught this on Netflix and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love nature having grown up in Alaska and learning about the earth's seasons all over the world was fascinating.  After watching it a few times, I decided that I have to own my own copy.  I recommend it for anyone wanting to know more about the earth's climate and seasons.  It is being shipped from UK so will take another month according to order tracking, but is worth the wait for me.  Have to be careful what version you buy as some will not play on US devices.  I give it a 5 out of 5.",1484265600,,550,4.1415094339622645
8502096,5,B006OMM7DG,"I found this documentary Sooo... amazing when I watched it on streaming video for the first time, that now I'm ordering the DVD from Amazon.com. At the time I viewed it, I was writing a paper and struggling to interpret a verse from the Holy Quran (2:164) describing seemingly disparate aspects of creation (earth, spin, sun, wind and weather) and asking myself why they were placed into the same paragraph?  This video helped me to understand that all those things form one holistic system, then permits us to tell time, varies weather and temperature, and even brings rainfall to the center of landmasses that sustains life: truly evidence of One Intelligent Creator.

I hope that Kate Humble and Dr. Helen Czerski continue this series on science and creation, and in particular, explain how the earth went from being a fireball of molten matter to a cooled planet with miles and miles of oceans on it. Where did all that water all come from?",1481500800,,944,4.785276073619632
