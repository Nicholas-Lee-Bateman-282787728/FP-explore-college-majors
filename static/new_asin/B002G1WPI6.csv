3924497,4,B002G1WPI6,"This item is a standard blu-ray container with all 3 movies (each on a separate disc) in it.  I actually give each film only 3 stars, but this is a pretty good deal which elevates the total package to 4 stars.

The story line is about a bunch of mutant cannibal hillbilles.  They are mutants due to birth defects from chemical contamination of the water supply (and inbreeding).  The chemicals also killed off the wildlife, so they now hunt people for food.  Lots of gore and not much else. Kinda a rip-off of ""The Hills Have Eyes"".  Not as well done, but they are watchable; and in this package they pretty good value for money.",1261699200,14,629,4.426086956521739

And I would also like to say the even though I haven't seen the special features on Wrong Turn 2 of any of the Wrong Turn's packaged in this 3 pack (not the Wrong Turn's sold in single DVD form) I've seen the special features on Wrong Turn & Wrong Turn 3, I would have to say THANK GOD THE CREATOR OF THIS 3 PACK DIDN'T INCLUDE WRONG TURN 4.  That movie sucks, is wrong on so many levels and is basically a crappy remake a bunch of posers did of the first Wrong Turn.  I hope the creators of the Wrong Turn series don't re-release the Wrong Turn series as a 4 pack with the forth installment, that would be a disgrace to the Wrong Turn movies just like the forth one was.",1329004800,,820,4.0184049079754605

3924570,4,B002G1WPI6,"The Wrong Turn 3 Pack Blu-ray edition is an economical way to acquire the horror trilogy that features cannibalistic inbred freaks, in the backwoods regions of West Virginia.  The Blu-ray edition is currently not that much more expensive than the regular DVD edition, and for certain fans, the high definition versions might be worth the extra cost.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.

Directed by Rob Schmidt, Wrong Turn (2003) took the familiar horror theme of travelers running into trouble, and gives it a new spin, as deformed cannibals hunt down and kill those who have the misfortune of crossing their path.  The inbreds are grotesque, vicious, and deadly with bow and arrow.  The cast includes Desmond Harrington (Ghost Ship), Eliza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Tru Calling), Emmanuelle Chriqui (Entourage), and Jeremy Sisto as the shocked and terrified prey, trying to avoid becoming dinner.  A frantic journey through the woods, is highlighted by a chilling game of hide and seek, high in the treetops surrounding an elevated watchtower, and a dramatically nasty kill with an axe.  A mostly well constructed and suspenseful thriller that finishes strongly, the film was a modest commercial success, and provided the impetus for a direct to video sequel.  Rating: Four Stars.

In Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) the level of violence is stepped up, as participants in a reality show become the prey of a family of inbred freaks.  Some victims are killed on the spot, while others are left running through the woods, trying to evade the freaks.  Ex-Marine Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) is the only hope for preventing a total massacre, as he battles back and tries to free those being held prisoner.  Suspense becomes secondary to gore and violence, as Wrong Turn 2 is a brutally satisfying film, with some tight action sequences and nasty kills.  With plenty of attractive prey, bloody action, and some strong performances, this is arguably the best of the three films.  The Blu-ray presentation adds some welcome sharpness, and helps to enhance some the action sequences and special effects.  Rating: Four Stars.

Wrong Turn 3: Left For Dead (2009), is easily the weakest in the series, as this time the adventure involves a group of escaped convicts trying to make find their way out of the woods.  The idea actually has some potential, but unfortunately the film suffers from poor writing, and some moronic brain damaged characters so inept and irritating, that you may be rooting for the inbreds.  With the ruthlessness of the freaks well established, the gore and special effects are the best thing about the film, which features some violent twists, creative kills, and sadistic traps, with one involving a tow truck and razor wire, being the most diabolical and enjoyable.  Like Wrong Turn 2, this film also benefits from the high def presentation.  Rating: Two stars.

The inbreds haven't been eliminated, making a return to West Virginia's wild and wonderful wilderness, at some point in the future, a possibility.  Hopefully any sequel will have more to offer than Wrong Turn 3.  The franchise has the potential for more wicked mayhem, but there needs to be at least a halfway decent story to keep the series from crash landing.  The 3-Pack merely combines the previously released Blu-ray versions, there are no additional bonus materials.",1297036800,3,3366,5.045207956600362

3924572,3,B002G1WPI6,"The 3 movies in this series are overall very good but as they progressed they got worse. 1 was definitely the best, 2 was really good and 3 lost something. It could have been the overall plot which was a little lame but it is watchable. I bought all 3 just to have the complete series so if that doesn't matter to you, get the first 2 only. Hopefully, there will be a number 4.",1279929600,7,377,4.04
