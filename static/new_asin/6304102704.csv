794059,5,6304102704,This is absolutely incredible. I would recommend anyone to watch this as it is a deeply moving film which gets right to the heart to the issue. Defintely at least two boxes of tissues needed. Ardderchog.,935020800,2,203,4.666666666666667
794060,5,6304102704,"This lyrical and lovely film may draw some favourable comparisons with ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" as it explores some of the same themes about the random cruelty of war.
Huw Garmon is a revelation as the  doomed Welsh poet Ellis Evans.  He handles a difficult role, which requires  quicksilver lurches from Evans' noted boyish charm to his sobering moments  of artistic reflection, with skill and aplomb. Surely this is one young  British actor we will be seeing again on this side of the  water!
""Hedd Wyn"" deserves a place in any intelligent person's  video collection.  It's a well crafted and beautifully acted work with a  timeless storyline.
And finally, I defy anyone to remain dry-eyed as the  infamous ""Black Chair"" (as it came to be called from that years'  Eisteddfod) is carried up to the little cottage belonging to Ellis Evans'  mother.",926380800,11,856,4.868055555555555
7863035,5,6304102704,"A brilliant, moving movie about a brilliant poet, whose work my so-so Welsh only barely allows me to appreciate.  The ultimate Welsh hero -- a Warrior Bard who works the land and yet fights when he must while longing for home.  It is a tragedy that this movie is not available in DVD in Region 1.

7863036,5,6304102704,"Welsh native speakers excel in this 1992 recreation of the life of poet Ellis Evans, who won the famous ""Cadair Ddu"" at the 1917 National Eisteddfod.  A multiple-award-winning film, first UK film to be nominated for ""best foreign language"" Oscar.  The Evans bio is romanticized, but well-done.  Very moving, especially as his winning poetry is read in the background of the fighting at Passchendaele.",1296000000,,400,5.21875
7863037,5,6304102704,"Hedd Wyn was the bardic name of a very talented Welsh poet who went into WWI so his younger brother would not be called up.  He died there.  This is a historical tragedy.  The poet's masterwork, a long poem on war, won the prestigious Eisteddfod prize, the Bard's Chair, but the poet was dead, and the chair was delivered in a solemn procession to his grieving family.  It's interesting to see a movie in Welsh with English subtitles.  Beautifully filmed, convincing characters, a moving story.",1175472000,,494,4.764705882352941
7863038,5,6304102704,"I am welsh, and I am studying welsh in my local college. We have studied this film and it is by far one of the best films Ive seen that includes english films as well. The whole film is basically a flash back of Hedd Wyn's life.

Hedd Wyn is the bardic name of Ellis Evans who is a farmer on his dad's farm in a small village called trawsfynydd (spelling). This film is serious as its about the first world war and how people were drafted and pulled away from their normal lifes to fight. There are many funny and humourous parts in the film which I find excellent. I highly recommend this film to you. It isn't gorey even tho it deals with war. Its more of a love story in a way. Hedd Wyn's love for his poetry and his love for women and Wales.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1146441600,,766,4.1
7863039,5,6304102704,"I am a student of Celtic Studies at Harvard University who has just started to learn Welsh, and has already fallen in love with the soft and graceful beauty of this language. Today we have seen the first hour of this wonderful film in class, and will see the remainder of it next week. The beauty of the Welsh poetic spirit was so evident in the first few minutes of the film, that my eyes were constantly on the verge of tears. The pleasure of hearing Welsh spoken by native Welsh speakers motivates me more than I can say to strive to be the best student I can be, and to become as fluent as is humanly possible for someone born so far outside of the actual culture. I have already ordered a copy of the film in VHS for myself, and intend to watch it until it wears out, or I understand every Welsh word spoken--whichever occurs first. Until then, please consider releasing it on DVD!!",1069632000,9,887,4.317365269461078
7863040,5,6304102704,"An outstanding film from S4C, HEDD WYN depicts the futility of war in general and specifically for the Welsh people. While England is fighting for King and country to save their way of life, the war is bringing about the destruction of the Welsh way of life. English troops and gunnery ranges planted squarely in one of the most Welsh areas of Wales disrupt the daily life. Still the men of Wales enlisted in droves despite the scorn heaped upon these Welsh speakers by their English superiors. As the war drags on, the death toll rises and casualties mount; those at home cannot escape the turmoil. Ellis Evans, a pacificist sheep herder from Trawsfynydd is finally forced into the army. From Flanders he completes his epic poem ""Yr Awrw"" (The Hero). From the spectacular landscapes filmed on location in and around Trawsfyndd, to the acting of this Welsh cast, the film HEDD WYN is absolutely wonderful. It may be somewhat difficult for those not familar with Welsh culture and of the importance of poetry and the Eisteddfod, but if you are willing to try, you will be rewarded. The Welsh language is wonderful. Cymru am byth!
I hope very  much that S4C, or whomever decides these things, would decide to issue this important Welsh film on DVD. Perhaps with a documentary on Ellis Evans and a taste of the Eisteddfod. Until then, iechyd dda pob Cymry!",997833600,17,1353,4.733050847457627
7863041,5,6304102704,"This film, which was nominated for an Oscar, is the most famous film made  in the Welsh language. It tells the story of Huw Garmon, known under his  poetic name Hedd Wyn, who tries to win the chair at the Eisteddfod.  (For  those of you who aren't Welsh-speakers: Being crowned at the Eisteddfod,  and being awarded the throne, is an enormous honour. It is by far the  greatest honour a Welsh writer can be awarded; quite like the Nobel-prize).  The film also tells of his life and his loves (he had a few). He grew up in  the middle of Wales, in Trawsfynydd, which is a beautiful, Welsh-speaking  place. The film also gives a picture of life in Wales in the early 20th  century.  The strongest message of the film is the opposition to war and  the meaningless slaughter of a generation in the World War.
Mae'r ffilm  'ma'n dda iawn, ffilm enwog yn Gymraed ydy o. Mae o'n dweud am Huw Garmon,  (y bardd Hedd Wyn) y mae o'n triw ennill y gadair ar y 'steddfod. Mae'r  ffilm yn siarad yn erbyn rhyfed.",968889600,9,999,4.353260869565218
7863042,5,6304102704,"As a welshman currently living away from Wales (In Cambridge UK) I can identify with the beautiful surroundings depicted in this film.
Probably the greatest triumph for the film in my opinion is it's  depiction of the futility of war. The scenes on the battlefield were  especially moving.
Beautifully acted (other than the father character),  beautifully filmed, and beautifully directed.",958608000,4,389,5.45

Y mae hi'n ffilm llawn emosiwn- yn wir, teimlais fel crio ar adegau (sai'n mynd i  sboilo'r ffilm a dweud beth sy'n digwydd!). Mae'n rhaid i chi wylio'r ffilm  hon, mae'n werth chweil ac yn haeddu'r enwebiad Oscar cafodd!
As a  Welsh-speaking person who is studying Media Studies and Welsh, I was  fortunate enough to be able to watch and appreciate this film. It is a film  full of emotion- indeed, at times I felt like crying (I won't spoil the  film and say what happens!). You must watch this film, it's  brilliant and  deserves the Oscar nomination it had!
(ON- 2 flynedd yn ol, wnes i gwrdd  a Huw Garmon (Hedd Wyn) a Sue Roderick (sy'n chwarae ei gariad a bellach ei  fam ar Pobol y Cwm), maen nhw'n wir yn gyfeillgar ac yn bobl dalentog iawn.  PS- 2 years ago, I met Huw Garmon (Hedd Wyn) and Sue Roderick (who played  his lover and now his mother on 'Pobol y Cwm' {a Welsh soap opera}, they're  really friendly and talented people).

7863044,4,6304102704,"I played 'Enid', Hedd Wyn's youngest sister. They wanted a local accent for the character so they held auditions at the local primary school, at which I was a pupil. Strangely enough, welsh was my second language!  Filming this was a valuable experience for me.....although to a 10 year-old  it was a bit slow and boring.  It made me realise that although I wished to  carry on with my acting career I would far rather do it on stage than on  screen!  In my opinion, the film has managed to portrey very accurately  the atmosphere of the area but however failed to illustrate Hedd Wyn's true  character.  According to surviving family members still living in the  village, he was far less serious and much less hard-working!",950054400,14,724,4.674603174603175
