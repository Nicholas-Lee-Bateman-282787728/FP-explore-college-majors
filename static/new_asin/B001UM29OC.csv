3803080,5,B001UM29OC,This DVD includes many calibration images that are easy to use and come with good instructions.  The DVD helps you evaluate every minute flaw in your display.  It even lets you evaluate deinterlacing performance at various frame cadences.  It might be worth taking this disc to the store to test out different televisions before buying one.  Once you've bought your TV you can be confident that you've obtained the best possible picture (aside from an ISF calibration).  Includes an instruction booklet and blue filters.,1258848000,,520,5.142857142857143
3803081,5,B001UM29OC,"Thank you Amazon for getting OPPO back to free-shipping status.
The benchmark BD now includes the blue filter promised by the publisher.",1257897600,3,136,5.2272727272727275
3803082,5,B001UM29OC,"The Spears & Munsil benchmark disk is outstanding.  If you have never used a benchmark/calibration disk before, rest assured this one will deliver visual results.  If you already have DVE or Avia, this disk may still offer some excellent test patterns.

I used this disk to calibrate and test my Epson 6500UB projector, and by the time I was done there was a notable difference in image quality.  This disk will get your image looking much more natural and 3-Dimensional if you follow it correctly and have the adjustments available on your HDTV that let you take advantage of it's patterns (like color decoder, RGB cutoffs/gains, etc).

It certainly gets you in the ball park much better than most test disks.  The color saturation pattern was especially well done.  It got the color range maximised very easily and easily showed if it was clipping or not.  As did the black level and contrast ramp tests.  Basically, this disk will let you peak every aspect of your display (black level, contrast, color levels, tint, sharpness, overscan, grayscale, color decoder, chroma delay, de-interlacing, and more).  If you want to take it to the next level, this disk is perfect to use before you use ColorHCFR and a colorimetre to get near perfect color levels and gamma.

The demonstration video on the disk is beautiful full HD footage that really shows what your system can do.  It present a wide range of real-life locales that all show exceptional detail, natural color, contrast and subtleties.  It's real treat.

It doesn't feature as many audio test as say DVE, but it features video test patterns that are every bit as good, and some that I would consider far superior to the average benchmark/optimizer disk.  This is a video system benchmark, and it focuses purely on delivering in that area very well.  The few audio test demonstrations include DTS Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD audio samples.  Limited, but fun little flicks.

All in all, I feel it was money well spent.  If you are looking for a complete HDTV/Bluray benchmark disk, or if you have DVE already and are looking for something more, this is the disk for you.",1257724800,7,2130,4.818181818181818
3803083,5,B001UM29OC,"This is exactly what I was looking for. The first time around, I tried the digital video essentials DVD and it was pretty aweful. This one has helpful explanations and the test patterns are more up to date and useful.  It helped me determine that I had a bad hdmi cable.",1257206400,,270,4.294117647058823
3803084,5,B001UM29OC,"Overall, this is a good disc for any electronics enthusiast.  There are many designs to calibrate with easy to follow instructions.  The disc helped out a lot.",1256688000,,159,4.851851851851852
3803085,4,B001UM29OC,"Although the user interface could be a little better,this is the reference High-Def calibration disc. And as an owner of a Oppo BDP-83 the price was right.",1256083200,,155,4.777777777777778
3803086,5,B001UM29OC,"I had originally used the Avia home theatre disc in conjunction with the tests on the Incredibles DVD to calibrate my tv.

After about ten minutes with this disc, my Panasonic Viera 50"" plasma was visibly better.  Very much so!

instructions were easy to follow and intuitive.

i highly recommend the Spears & Muncil disc for anyone with a BD player and an HDtv.",1255478400,12,362,4.609375
3803087,4,B001UM29OC,There appears to be a great deal of options which are not well described.  The instructions need to be focused on both the professional and layman.,1255305600,5,147,4.653846153846154
3803088,5,B001UM29OC,"This video calibration disc is simple and straight to the point. It explains in simple language what you are testing for. How to test with the patterns provided, then it shows you  what  correct  and incorrect patterns look like. Then it gives you the opportunity to calibrate the illustrated pattern using your TV remote. Best of all the information is not overwhelming and boring but very engaging and stimulating.

HINT:If you watch TV at night then perform your calibration at night, under the same light condition. Do not calibrate your TV in the morning or afternoon unless you do most of your watching at those times.

For test tones calibration, use the ""AIX Records"" audio calibration disk. This can also be bought online at amazon.

These two calibrations disks are also included in the OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray player, if you plan to buy Oppo blu-ray player.",1253750400,9,864,4.883561643835616

3803095,5,B001UM29OC,"If you want to calibrate your HD picture I highly recommend this Blu-ray disc. I didn't realize how far out the adjustments were on my TVs & I am much happier with my picture after using the calibration disc. I have used this disc for my 52"" Sony & also my 32"" Visio.

If you have not calibrated your HD TV yet, what are you waiting for? Get your picture looking better.
And much better than any shown on a showroom floor.

It does take some time to go through the adjustments to get your picture better but you will be happy with the results.",1394323200,,543,4.161904761904762
3803096,5,B001UM29OC,"I used this Blu-ray to dial in my new home theater system.  It did not make a highly noticeable difference, but did make enough difference that I am glad I bought it.

I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.

3803098,4,B001UM29OC,This product was purchase to calibrate a large screen flat screen television with a more than adequate blu-ray dvd player.  The disc does an excellent job of going through the proper procedures to set-up a flat panel system. . .step-by-step.,1392336000,,241,5.025

3803101,3,B001UM29OC,"It works, it's expensive. I don't really need to say anything here as you likely already know this is the best of the best when it comes to setting up your TV and AV system properly. I do however think they are overpriced and always have been even when they were on DVD.",1376524800,,270,4.113207547169812
3803102,5,B001UM29OC,"I have used Avia and DVE, and I have found that the menu systems on both of these discs are a lot less than straight forward.  Spears & Munsil menu system is very easy to follow and laid out linearly.  While the basic calibration technique is similar to the other discs up to a point, Spears & Munsil goes a step further than the others and runs the tests for each color space to determine the best combination.

While the technique does take some study to learn, it gets easier with practice.

One other important point is that these test patterns are mastered for Blu-Ray: they are not DVD format.  Other discs that are not in Blu-Ray format cannot be used for as precise a calibration.

The audio test samples are also easy to use, and they do not turn off after a short time, like some other discs.  This disc can be used for first order calibration of both video and audio, and is a pretty good buy as compared to professional calibration.",1374624000,,944,4.390804597701149

I'm using a spectracal i1 and free burned discs out there of patterns when I calibrate.

3803106,4,B001UM29OC,"Bought this to visually color calibrate my plasma TVs.  It worked great, and they look much better now.  Definitely read the included instructions.

3803107,5,B001UM29OC,"As long as you're doing your tuning baseline using a Blu-ray component, this will do the job very well, and includes blue filter glasses.  I still use my own gels from previous test discs so I can do red blue and green filtering for color correction, personally, but I verified using the blue filter and it works just as well as using only my blue gel.  For those who need to tune per input and not all inputs are Blu-ray compatible, you will still need a DVD based tuning disc or other format as I do.",1362614400,,502,4.21875
