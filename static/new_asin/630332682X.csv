I thought it was just because my family is southern Italian and I'm biased,  but everone else I've shown it to has been equally moved.  The children are  not actors - they were chosen off the streets of southern Italy by the  director - which makes their performances even more impressive and honest.  It examines the problems of southern Italy through the eyes of its  children, making the problems all the more devastating.  Yet in the end the  viewer is left with the innocence and hope only youth can provide. See this  movie!  You'll be an instant fan.",919382400,11,694,4.508064516129032
631965,5,630332682X,"This is one of the funniest films you will ever see...but it also very endearing because of the children whom you just can't help but love.  The acting is superb by all cast members.  It is sub-titled in English, and filmed in Italian...but don't let that deter you from seeing it.  It is easy to follow...and I guarantee that you will watch it many times.  It will become one of the best purchases you ever made.  It is the best little slice of Italy anywhere in the world.",1316908800,,474,4.340909090909091
631966,4,630332682X,"Ciao, Professore ! is a very funny and outrageous movie not to be missed.
I love Lina Wermuller's films, and I own most of her movies on DVD.",1315958400,,141,4.071428571428571
631967,5,630332682X,"I can't say enough about this under-appreciated movie. It is really a shame that it is not widely available in DVD format.

Set in poor school in Naples, it is the story of a Northern Italian teacher who was mistakenly sent to Naples.  An inevitable clash of cultures ensues, but in the end our kindly teacher and his unruly students learn to love and appreciate each other. No complete happy ending though, the professore goes back north and the children are left in Naples in wretched conditions. The saving grace is that you get the feeling that everyone will be O.K. regardless of their challenges.

For learners of Italian the sub-titles are done pretty well. For everyone else, it is just a good story.",1315180800,,708,4.693548387096774
631968,5,630332682X,This is a truly wonderful film about a man who is still learning and that is the charm of this film the children teach him.  A lesson for anyone who is stuck in a rut! The classic divide (Italy stops at Rome) couldn't be better expressed. (It's the reverse in Britain south to north)  What a charming and witty film...they don't  make them like that anymore.,1301529600,,358,4.393939393939394
631969,5,630332682X,THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. VERY FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE. THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE ROUGH BUT DOES STAY WITHIN BOUNDS,1291248000,,110,4.285714285714286
631970,5,630332682X,"This is a great movie, I bought it for my girlfriend as a gift. She's going to be a teacher and we loved it. She was also learning Italian, and I, being a spanish speaker understood most of it.

I don't wanna spoil it, so I suggest you watch it yourself, awsome flick!!! something like ''Stand And Deliver'' but in italian and a younger cast. It has a lot of cursing, specially by the kids. But this makes the spirit of the movie, any audience will relate to it, because we were all a kid once.... Highly recomended, Ciao amici!!!!",1280448000,,531,4.31
631971,5,630332682X,"I first saw this movie at a mini Italian film festival in June. I have never laughed so loud and so long.  What an incredible movie!  Hilarious...yet so touching.  The children are marvelous.  I had no idea that they were not even actors, just local children!

As soon as I arrived home from the theater I logged on to Amazon and purchased the DVD!!  I have watched it again with my mother.  Loaned it to my boss, to one of my staff and have another colleague waiting in line for it.  All who have seen it, love it.",1278288000,,515,4.183673469387755
631972,5,630332682X,This is one of those films that is both comedy and beauty rolled up into one.  It is a fantastically beautifully-told story that has many moments of brilliant comedy folded into its' multi-layered story of life in a town near Naples.  The children are the real stars that will grab your heart and not let go.,1273449600,,308,4.482142857142857
631973,4,630332682X,"CIAO PROFESSORE, with Marco Sperelli will probably be a bore and
bring back a lot of stressful experiences for anyone who's been a
grade school professor. On the other hand, for people who are not
teachers, this is a movie that will be either easily
underestimated and misunderstood or bring back a number of
childhood memories, and constitute a gem of sorts.

The challenges of a teacher, in some towns as shown in this
picture, are immense. This picture brings into focus the critical
nature of schooling among kids, in the building of their
character, intelligence and individual futures. It also
emphasizes the humanity of both instructor and child, in the
unique relationship that must be established between the two
groups, and maintained, for learning to occur, which is comprised
not only of facts, but also of energy, vitality and solidarity,
patience, among other things.

Aside from the above, there is also the fascinating time capsule
of Naples, Sicily and Southern Italy chosen as the location for
filming, intentionlly underlining the more traditional, 18th and
19th century buildings, cobble stone streets, fishing villages
aspects, vs. the modern developments in those same cities, of the
20th and 21st centuries.

The Italian dialogue is fluid, extremely articulate by the actors
chosen. There is almost a laugh a minute, which is at the same
time, tragic, in the sense that a succession of mature, typically
grown up logical though processes, conclusions and life
experiences are spoken.

The downside, is perhaps the repetition of the stereotype that
there is a split not only in cultures, but of character and
societal behavior among North and South Italy.",1270166400,,1677,5.154411764705882
631974,5,630332682X,"I really liked the story of a sweet professor, who mistakingly is assigned to a 3rd grade class of delinquents in a poor part of Italy, outside of Naples, who takes the time with them and go where the other teachers haven't by standing up for them (and to them in some cases).
The children are rambunctious, foul-mouthed, but cute with their ways and he tames them.",1262822400,,365,4.462686567164179
632005,5,630332682X,This is a very sweet movie and you will fall in love with the children! A definite one to see and or buy!,1213228800,,105,3.608695652173913
632006,5,630332682X,"This movie is one of my all time favorite Italian movies. Like many Italian movies that I have seen, it touches on the issue of poverty and family life in a small town all bundled in to a comedy.",1199750400,,195,4.0256410256410255
632007,5,630332682X,This is definentely a favorite in our home. This is a movie which you can watch over and over again with out ever getting tired. An excellent movie both executed and directed. You'll be pleasantly surprised.,1193356800,,207,4.777777777777778
632008,4,630332682X,"Feel those heart jitters? That's a genuine reaction from a heart-squeezing, fast-moving comedy about Marco Sperelli a teacher from uppity Northern Italy who is assigned - mistakenly - to teach street-smart third graders in a town near Naples.

The language might singe my ears if i understood Italian - - even so, a few asterisks or bleeps wouldn't be out-of-place!  *Ciao* is vulgar & leaning toward an X-rating but it has just the right mix of garlic, laughter and truly heart-felt *lessons*.

Reviewer mcHAIKU would be surprised if you didn't want to watch more than once this Professore bumbling along . . . confronted by some pretty amazing young actors.  Don't let *Back-to-School Sales* get you down - - check out *CIAO, PROFESSORE!*  for a busload of laughs.",1185840000,4,766,4.953125
632009,4,630332682X,I am hoping that by watching Italian movies with English subtitles this may help me understand and speak the language.  Good comedy,1184025600,,131,4.954545454545454
632010,5,630332682X,"This movie shows the big difference between Northern and Southern Italy, between the rich and the poor and what such difference does to children.

You will need to own this DVD because you will watch this movie many times.",1174348800,,222,4.6923076923076925
632011,5,630332682X,The story is magnificent.  The children are adorable.  The characters seem real.,1163030400,,80,5.583333333333333
632012,3,630332682X,"The charm of this film lies in the adaptation
of the essays written by 8 and 9-year old
schoolchildren in the Neapolitan suburb of
Arzano. That these were turned into dialog
so successfully is a triumph of screen-
writing-the originals are poignant, but not
so eloquent. Paolo Villagio is perfectly
cast as the professore from the North who
brings his Padanic sensibilities to the
Mezzogiorno. The clash of cultures comedy
is predictable but engaging.

The chilling aspect of the film is the
overwhelming pessimism that has pervaded
the outlook of children at such an early
age. It is most un-American and for us,
with our rosy views of childhood, disconcerting.

It's worth pointing out that if you're
trying to learn Italian by watching movies,
(not a bad approach at that) this may not
be right for you. The Neapolitan dialect
is difficult for many Italian speakers
and is different enough from what you would
need to know in other parts of Italy.

632013,5,630332682X,"This movie, the story of a teacher from an upscale area who is mistakenly assigned to a poverty-stricken school, is heartwarming and very funny. The acting is superb; the children are street kids who quickly win your heart as you get to know each one's distinct personality and life's story.  I am trying to learn to speak Italian, so it serves a double purpose for me. I've watched a number of other Italian movies, which were enjoyable, but this one I watch again and again.",1152748800,4,476,4.6
632090,4,630332682X,"I enjoyed Ciao, Professore! very much. It was poignant, charming, and humorous. Coming from an Italian background, I have recommended it to family and friends, especially Italians!",1125014400,,180,5.703703703703703
632091,5,630332682X,"This is a fantastic film that really encompasses some of the less fortunate areas of Naples.  I do not reccomend this film to Non-Italian speakers because the English subtitles don't do it any justice.  For that matter I don't even reccomed it to Non-Neapolitan speakers.(Neapolitan by the way, is the dialect of the city of Naples).  It is very different from Italian, so even to Italian speakers it can be a different language.  I grew up in Naples myself and attended pre-school, elementary-school, middle-school, and part of what we would call high-school there.  Although I was fortunate enough to grow up in a nicer area than the one portrayed in this film and go to nicer schools, it still very much deals with the ongoing problems of southern Italy.  It can seem like a childish film, however it is very complex and has many underlying themes within it.  This film was originally titled ""Lo speriamo che me la cavo"" hence the last line that Raffaele says in the film, however I think they changed it to ""Ciao, Professore"" so that Non-Italian speakers could actually pronounce it.  A great film, and another great perfomance by Paolo Villaggio.",1107043200,20,1151,4.836734693877551
632092,5,630332682X,"CIAO, PROFESSORE is a film that deserves to be in everyone's collection.  Every aspect of this utterly charming story is so well done that it feels perfect.  Based on actual 3rd grade children's essays from a school outside of Naples, Italy, the script sings and dances in words that only children could have spoken.  Lina Wertmuller takes this fine script and populates it with fine actors: Paolo Villaggio is inimitable as the Professor who comes form Northern Italy to the squalor of Southern Italy with all of the ideals of a dedicated teacher in place - or out of place, as he finds in the poverty and crime stricken city of Corsano; Isa Danieli is the coarse and world-hardened Principal of the school; and the children who begin as renegades and slowly enter a mutual transformation with the Professore are played by 'non-professional actors' gleaned from Naples.  The children steal the show, so individual and committed are they to their roles.  A film about poverty and misguided kids could be depressing, but Wertmuller and her fine cast make this a celebration of the human spirit without ever dipping into bathos.  This is one of the finest movies about the teacher/student relationship that has ever been made -and that is saying a lot. Highly Recommended.",1085616000,76,1270,4.911214953271028
632093,5,630332682X,"This movie, of a professore from the North, who gets transferred in error to a village outside of Napoli is a funny but sobering look at the conditions that the southerners had to live with and still do. You'll love the approach of the film to the societal problems of the south, you'll laugh and then want to cry, all at the same moment. If your family origins are from southern Italy, the memories of our dialect are unmistakable, enjoyable, nostalgic and funny.",1017187200,19,464,4.602409638554217
632094,5,630332682X,"I saw this film several times - I was born and went to elemntary and grade school in Naples - as it reminded me all to well of both the incredible warmth, generosity and spirit of my fellow Neapolitans as well as the many evil and decaying aspects of life that persist.  I was lucky enough to live in the City itself and go to a better school; however, the film is actually based on very real events and is merely somewhat adapted to ease the translation into film.  The movie - and most of the dialogue - is based on a book that collected the essays of grade 3 students in the De Amicis school in Arzano, a poor suburb of Naples, in the late 80's. The teacher had collected the genuine and honest tales of life as precieved by his students.  In the film the teacher comes from another city through bureaucratic error; in the book he's as Neapolitan as pizza.  The excellent children actors - who were chosen among regular school children in Arzano (called Corsano in the film) - in fact use dialogue that is lifted directly from the essays.  Unfortunately, to capture the full humor, knowing Italian is not enough, it's necessary to understand Neapolitan dialect and the psychology of Neapolitans.  One of my favorite characters - apart from the briosche loving fat kid (I love briosche also) is the old and very sarchastic uncle who advises the baby that life is tough and hardly a collection of smiles.  Like all Wertmuller's films, this one has a lot of humanity and is ultimately optimistic about the future of humanity.  i suppose that's why she chooses so many of her film subjects among the very human people of Naples.",1007424000,55,1627,4.5290102389078495
632095,4,630332682X,"A delightful tale told well about life in the ghettos of Naples and how kids get trapped into a life with no future.  The amazing part of this film is that the children who played the parts of the ghetto kids were actually local kids from the ghetto with no acting experience!  They do an acting job that puts most of Hollywood's kid stars to shame.  All the acting was first rate as was the direction and technical aspects of the film.
Heart warming and very funny.  Certainly worth seeing from both an entertainment and educational point of view.",978134400,19,548,4.505050505050505
632096,5,630332682X,"This movie is yet another proof that the exuberance of hollywood and its multi-million dollar productions, full of gratuitous violence and sex is not the path to follow to a great movie. The way the story is told, the  sensibility of its interpretation, the superb work of Paolo Villaggio and  the rest of the cast make of this movie one of my favorites.  Indeed, not a  recommend if you are an action movie person. For those of you who liked  touchy, intelligent, profound movies, refrain not.",962236800,14,494,4.6976744186046515
632097,5,630332682X,"This is a very touching movie.  The story has been told in many ways, but somehow this movie shows a freshness of its own.  A northern Italian teacher is sent to southern Italy (Napoli or a town near it) due to an  error. Few of the children go to school because of economic and social  difficulties.  Il professore goes out to the streets and homes and drags  the children to class. The children are mostly street smart wise guys.  The  movie is rated R due to a constant stream of  crude language by the  children, but don't let that stop you. (I would like to know what a fart  jockey is.)
Eventually, the teacher and the children learn from each  other profoundly, etc.
The acting more than makes up for the  plot!
Enjoy!",953078400,19,725,4.360902255639098

632099,5,630332682X,"Ciao, Professore! is an absolutely wonderful Italian film dealing not only with the cleverness and light-heartedness of children, but also with the unfortunate political and social problems that rage in Southern Italy.  The  film, though distinctly European, does not assume too much of the viewer in  any respect, and one has the opportunity to see how Italians view the  North/South and regional splits that continue to fragment the country.  The  tale, following the exploits of a middle class teacher transferred by  accident to a lower class elementary school, shows how the Northern teacher  and Southern students gain respect for one another and reconcile their  differences.  The film is not afraid to comment on Southern problems that  include crime, pollution, and poverty, nor on the people who endure these  for the sake of their families and children.  If you are tired of mob films  that spin Italians in a negative light, come learn how wonderful these  people really can be. An amusing comedy that the whole family can watch  together...simple enough for children and sophisticated enough for adults.  Five stars.",941500800,24,1129,5.217877094972067
