8463829,4,B005B0ZF5E,"This is a beautifully made movie of ""old"" Korea. The costumes alone make the movie worth the watch. I understand it is based on a popular story in Korea, and this movie took some artistic license. Not knowing the original, I just enjoyed it. It is a romance, where two men, one high born, the other his servant, both love and court the same woman. She, of course, loves the servant, but wants to better her life, and schemes for the nobleman. The ending had a twist I didn't expect.

Contains nudity and sex (beautifully done) so may not be appropriate for all viewers.",1388534400,,569,4.471153846153846
8463830,4,B005B0ZF5E,"It is a beautifully made and wonderfully acted love story. The leading actress is gorgeous and it is worth getting this vid just to watch her. Yes, there is a little bit of sex scenes in the movie. They are not really necessary but I am not complaining.

The story is very straightforward - a guy falls in love with a girl he can't have....gets the girl....BUT in the end.....

A sad but beautiful ending. Not a 'superb' movie but it is still really good.

I like the Concubine more.",1383264000,,483,4.344444444444444
8463831,4,B005B0ZF5E,"I thought this movie had a good storyline, and good acting. The cinematography was also good, as well as the costumes.",1359936000,,118,4.666666666666667
8463832,4,B005B0ZF5E,"An alternate take on the Korean classic 'The Tale of Chunhyang.'  Instead of celebrating the love between Yi Mongryong and Chunhyang that transcended class barriers, here Chunhyang is a calculating woman who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice her true love for a chance to marry up.  Yi Mongryong is also shown as a vainglorious young man whose devotion to Chunhyang doesn't stem from true love but his sense of superiority and anger at being bested by an inferior man (i.e. Bang-Ja, his servant).  Interestingly, Bang-Ja is shown as the most noble, faithful character of them all, in contrast to his original portrait as a sly man whose primary function was to facilitate the budding relationship between his master and Chunhyang.  Quite twisted but who knows?  Maybe this adaptation is more faithful to how people might have behaved than the idealized portrait in the original classic.",1318204800,11,882,5.097222222222222
