Sometimes some people are too good to be true.

Dan Stevens plays US Special Forces soldier David, returning from the Middle East to turn his charm on the family of a deceased veteran with whom he served. Despite initial suspicion, the family take David in, allowing him to fill the gaping hole in their lives. David has that special ability to soothe with extreme politeness and preternatural ability to insinuate himself where he is most needed. But when local townsfolk start turning up dead, Maika Monroe - Anna begins to suspect that David isn't quite as attractive as he seems. Playing to a more mainstream audience than his previous outings, director Adam Wingard increasingly ludicrous chiller/shocker has plenty of tongue and cheek with this genre convention, unafraid to laugh at itself as the body count rises and as David's knowing nods and winks become manic twitches. As we move toward a surreal third act, the tension dissolves into goofy goriness reminiscent of 1970/80s slasher flick. The whole film seems to have the underlying feel of John Carpenters' 80s Halloween - especially when it comes to the rather well done synthy sound track, which in itself-enhances the chill factor.

To sum up David is a charismatic, Machiavellian cipher. He knows that those baby blues eyes (or are they grey?) and a six-pack stomach can repel even the most stalwart suspicions. Therein lies the real danger because you are totally off guard when his demeanour changes.",1410912000,66,1489,5.044715447154472

6673475,1,B00NO834N0,"This film has more than one scene of some nice woman being graphically stabbed to death. It is the most gruesome film I have ever seen. This is a horror film meant to surprise you by misleading you into believing it is a shoot-em-up action film. The film promotes drug use. The film promotes one night stands of premarital sexual intercourse with some good-looking stranger you have just met a few minutes ago. The portrayed good guy in the film says ""I know you brutally murdered all those innocent people, but I will not tell, because we are friends."" The film promotes illegal gun sales to strangers. In this film the parents are fools and the children figure everything out, and tell the parents off. This film says, if you are bullied at school do not go to your fool parents or to your fool teachers, but rather, get a weapon, and use it. The film is intriguing. It moves at a good pace and keeps your interest. The film has good actors. It lures you in. It is as alluring as a beautiful, high-priced call-girl, which in the end leaves you violated and used. The story is mindlessly illogical in the end, but leads you on cleverly. On a positive note; the film does show there are some very smart, charming, talented, people out there looking to lure you in, and then destroy you.",1527379200,,1286,4.476595744680851

6673478,4,B00NO834N0,"The writer describes The Guest as Halloween III meets The Terminator, and I think that's a surprisingly apt description. This movie is part horror, part thriller, part comedy, and it absolutely nails every genre. While it may appear on the surface to be a typical ""mysterious house guest"" thriller, it's actually a loving homage to the horror/thrillers of the 1980s (before doing homages to the films of the 1980s was really a thing). A tense, compelling synthwave soundtrack really sets a good mood, and the acting and dialog is appropriately campy, despite everything being played pretty straight.

6673482,4,B00NO834N0,I don't normally review movies but this one I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did. I went in blind and was pleasantly surprised at seeing Dan Stevens playing a very different character than Cousin Matthew on Downton Abbey. It kept me guessing his secret until the end where it cascaded into familiar slash flick territory. I think Stevens was eager to shed his good boy image for something much different and it payed off.,1521072000,,426,4.545454545454546

Not just Matthew Crowley, but a very fine and physically fit specimen as such. However the movie itself unfolded as a B-quality Bourne Identity of sorts, with ridiculous scenarios and fight scenes  - almost campy, which would have been fun, but not quite.  My daughter loves this movie, so your mileage may vary. Definitely not my cup of tea, but Dam Stevens is exceptionally hawt in it, so that might just tide you over for the duration.",1520467200,,538,4.712765957446808

6673488,3,B00NO834N0,"The first half is great. Then it devolves into a Friday the 13th style B movie. The plot goes wrong when the good guys start dying for bad reasons. That is one of the sins of movie making. The audience hates that. Compare this to Jodie Foster in The Brave One, where she kills the right people. Now imagine if Jodie shot her black cop friend at the end to save herself. That would be a plot sin. Such sins occur in this. So it went from a 5 star start to a one star ending, and averaged 3. Then it used another B movie trick a la Michael Myers at the end.",1518307200,,555,3.920353982300885

That pretty much describes this movie. Aside from Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey, the rest of the cast seems to have been selected only because they vaguely resemble other actors that might seem familiar.

Every element of the story line has been overused in other films, right down to the very predictable conclusion. Very disappointed!",1517875200,,492,4.857142857142857

6673491,3,B00NO834N0,"I was curious to see DOWNTON ABBEY'S Dan Stevens in a very different role of a bad guy. Stevens is usually the good guy but in THE GUEST we see his great range of acting talents.

Laura and Spencer Peterson and their kids Luke and Anna are a disconnected family dealing with the death of the oldest son in military action.
Enter the mysterious David who claims to have been a close friend of deceased son. He quickly win's the family's trust with his polite and gentle ways. But David may not be who he seems and we soon see a different and violent side of David.

There really is not much to this story except for the suspense of wondering who David is and why he showed up at the Peterson home. The real gem here is the cool and collected Dan Stevens as David. He calculated moves and his shifting facial emotions show what a really talented actor Stevens is. This movie can be a pass except for watching Stevens' performance",1516579200,,927,4.3526011560693645

6673496,5,B00NO834N0,"Great retro kind of movie. Has a definite 80's Carpenter feel. The action escalates quite rapidly in The Guest and doesn't let up. And of course the score (NOT THE SOUNDTRACK) is epic. Steve Moore has made some amazing scores since he did The Guest. This is one of his best. Anyone who's familiar with Zombi or Moore's solo albums knows what I'm taking about. Vintage synthesizer power at its finest.

It wasn't what I expected because it looks one way and sort of becomes something else. I really appreciated a lot of the great lines. There was a lot of subtlety in the character development and emotions. It's a movie that I think shows more than it tells so you need to pay attention and be open to what it's doing.

The overall theme becomes evil guy commits evil acts to help everyone out, but then  everyone gets killed, so those acts don't really count because hey, they were evil to begin with. The young protagonist learns how to help himself from evil guy, who happens to be a neuropsychotropically engorged Bourne experiment. In the long run this is a low budget horror/thriller which is a good first effort, but, nobody is seeing this as a sophisticated movie. I think.

A family mourning the loss of their son while serving in the Army in the Middle East opens their home to David, a returning soldier and friend of their deceased son. David seems to be very helpful to the family, a shoulder to lean on and helping the family deal with day-to-day problems. But David seems to be hiding something from them.

Combine all of this with some average acting, and the WORST faux 80's soundtrack I've ever heard and there is no way this could ever get more than two stars. This is a classic example of a movie that could have been really good, but you can physically feel the writer running out of steam and uncertain of how to elevate this story. There are some really good action scenes and some exciting fights, but you should NOT invite this guest into your home.",1471132800,,818,4.533783783783784
6673551,5,B00NO834N0,"Wow! The Guest was a great surprise! How this excellent thriller didn't get more recognition baffles me. Its one of the coolest, slickest, intense, exciting and well made thrillers I've seen since the 90s right up there with John Wick and Drive. Great performances all around. A terrific atmosphere and tone. It pays loving and respectable homage to so many great 70s and 80s horror movies its a blast to pick out which ones while watching it. I'm going to guess that The Guest isn't for everyone due to it's unusually low 3 1/2 star rating on here. I think its more of a 70s and 80s horror/thriller fan's movie. Beyond that though it's still a very suspenseful and exciting thriller. If it's a deep story you're looking for this probably won't be for you but if you want a completely exhilerating experience definitely check this great thriller out.",1471046400,,850,4.7114093959731544

6673567,5,B00NO834N0,"This is a great film and I haven't seen anything like this in years. I mean in years!
This movie is a fine combination of <Bourn Identity><Terminator> and all other action movies and the most original action films you can imangine, you got it.
Plus the coolest soundtrack you can have+ great art work included and the very charming actor Dan Stevens that you just happen to discover.
Any woman will be hard not to fall in love with him the moment you see him.
He has two faces, smile gentle face, a baddass with no heart.

From the beginning when this guy Dan Stevens appears to this family, there is an unknown tension and that tension goes all the way till we find out that he is keeping his secret from the family.
I won't spoil a lot about the story since I am telling you once more that this is one of the best movie that was made in 2014 and became my top 10 action movie list right away along with POINT BLANK and many other films.

Like I said, Dan Stevens is a really strange and charming guy.
When he smiles, he can melt any woman who sees him just like that.
And plus, he got the most well built body too. It's like a thin guy with all the muscle that he can have.
But when he make his face look serious, no one, I mean no one can even look straight in his eyes at all.
He looks as it he will kill someone at that spot.

I am very sure that he will be a great star very soon.
He is currently involved in 6 films and is very very busy.

As I mentioned the music from this movie is really amazing. It's very modern and super cool.
Mostly house music with electro sound.
Along with the music is the cool art work.
The best is the school with holoween prepared tunnel like place that reminded me of Bo Welch's work from Tim Burton's movies like <BEETLEJUICE><EDWARD SCISSORHANDS>

The movie has two parts and that was kind of a surprise that you will enjoy a lot.
But most of us probably will enjoy the first half.

This is the movie that no one should skip.

Best movie made after 2014.",1464307200,,1994,4.136950904392765

6673569,5,B00NO834N0,"The Guest is without question the best movie of the past few years. This is an absolute must-see for fans of classic action/thrillers, hearkening back to the glory days of Terminator, Halloween, and Aliens without relying on obvious references or nostalgia to keep it afloat. It has an incredibly pleasurable old-school 80's James Cameron vibe with vibrantly drawn characters and ingenious action set pieces. It's a remarkably tight film, with nary a wasted scene to be found-- an absolute blast, start to finish. I saw it twice in theaters, and purchased the Blu-Ray/DVD as soon as it came out. Also worth mentioning: the soundtrack is mind-blowingly incredible-- primarily consisting of goth, post-punk, electro, and italo disco, it's the icing on an already amazing cake of a movie.

It's actually really well done for what it is. Not familiar with this Dan Stevens guy but you can't help but admit he is a really good actor. He has this utterly creepy charm in the movie and also does the fight and action scenes in a very believable fashion. He should have a long career in the industry if the Jason Bourne/James Bond crowd notices him. This is one of those under-the-radar movies that is easy to miss but is a real showcase for the actors on board.

And while the plot is somewhat predictable not all pieces come together as you might think for a movie like this.

6673599,4,B00NO834N0,"This is an interesting psychological action thriller. Has all the remnants of a modern grindhouse drive-in feature film. Slick, fun, action-packed and interesting in the idea of secrets and lies. A mystery that slowly unfolds when an ex-military named David enters the life of one family. The mystery around him and why he is there slowly comes to light in a great violent thriller that I actually really enjoyed.

Directed by Adam Wingard, who I enjoyed from his other feature films, skits and segments in the VHS and ABC's of Death films along with his film You're Next. Always a treat to watch anything he creates. He showcases the old-school aspect of horror, action and a psychological reality to his many films that slowly grow on the viewer and become a cult like setting of film.

This one is written by Simon Barrett. Barrett and Wingard have collaborated together on many films such as the horror You're Next. Both are perfect together in creating memorable situations and memorable characters and one of kind plots. Barrett knows what he wants and he showcases his ultimate imagination on page and Wingard creates that imagination in movie form. Another interesting note is that you have your cameo of AJ Bowen who has been a stable in Wingard and Barrett's films. From 2010's A Horrible way to Die to 2011's You're Next and many others. Both Barrett and Wingard are a nice wrecking team of old school thrills that I highly love and thankfully because of these two, I still enjoy.

I think what I like so much about this film is it's done in a sophisticated way. Done with the right amount of tension, the right amount of mystery woven around flawless acting. All the performers create a perfect persona of each of the characterizations going through what is happening. The movie comes together as a thick plot of story and building up of the character. The plot then throws the right amount of action-packed violence, but without overdoing it.

I like its dark reality and darkened tone. The attitude and hidden terror of Dan Stevenss performance is golden. He bleeds terrifying. One moment calm the next the hidden darkness explodes. Stevens is perfect in the role as the mysterious David. I loved all the performers. The beautiful Maika Monroe graces the teenage angst part and also the voice of logic. She displays her role in a reality based setting that gives the viewer a perfect character. Another shinning role is Brendon Meyer. The picked on bullied outcast that ends up liking and becoming friends with David. A perfect actor. I understood his character and related to his character through his solid performance. A really gifted actor.

Loved the no holds bar examination of violence and ruthless actions. The concept and the idea of right and wrong or the simplistic idea of good and bad alter itself and twists into violent unattached moments of sadistic perfection.

Ultimate Super Soldier killing machine meets a late night horror movie.

I love the soundtrack. The acting. The direction and story. It became so much. I was not expecting this little gem. I loved it and felt its slick, dark mysterious persona.",1448409600,,3137,4.85233644859813

The Guest is a movie that you'll either really appreciate or really not. At the initial glance - it seems to be a run-of-the-mill story, yet it constantly evolves and shifts into something completely different. In the first act you'll be thinking you're watching one type of movie, and by the end you'll feel as if you're watching a different movie altogether. It has countless memorable moments, can be downright hilarious at times, and has a mesmerizing soundtrack that won't leave your head after the film.

6673617,3,B00NO834N0,"The Guest revisits the often told plot of a stranger arriving at the door of a family and lethally fixing the problems they are having at school or work to improve their lives. It's often done with a nanny or a neighbour but this time round that stranger is a man who tells the mother who answers the door that his name is David, and he served with her son who was recently killed in action, and he had promised her son that he would check on his family when he got back to the US.  Of course you can't really slam the door in someone who says that's face, and it isn't long before the guest has charmed the woman and has her offering to let him sleep in her son's old room rather then walk back down the road to a motel he remembers passing on the way there.  The hospitality soon extends to picking her bullied son up from school, accompanying the teen daughter to a party, and basically treating him like the son her husband and she lost after reassuring his protests that he doesn't want to impose as no, we'd be grateful if you would.

It's when the writers of The Guest decides about three quarters of the way through to add an interesting original plot angle into the same old story that it falls flat and fails to deliver.  While trying to remain vague so as not to spoil much for you the daughter makes a phone call, that is instantly passed up the chain into a drop everything we've finally found this guy moment.  But we never find out what exactly David did, or even what he is.  Or what was going on at this place where an event happened where it was assumed David perished. Spoiler alert  - Instead we simply have a shoot out, they could have just had the small time police force turn up thinking he's a con artist/murderer and done the same scene.  But instead we're left with questions that go unanswered.

As simply a remake of the often told plot it was okay, not the best remake by any means but certainly watchable.  It probably would have been better simply leaving it as that type of film rather than trying to come up with something clever, if they weren't prepared or didn't know what to do with the twist.",1443830400,,2130,4.276119402985074

The story follows a family who gets a visit from a friend of their son, who was Killed In Action.

The climax in the Halloween fun house is incredibly stupid. The military characters are embarrassingly and unrealistically incompetent. Far too much about the story is left dangling and unexplained and the characters' credibility and verisimilitude oddly dissipates.

6673653,5,B00NO834N0,"While I certainly am no fan of Adam Wingards overrated Youre Next, I did have a really good time with this fun and very 80s thriller. The story finds the Peterson family grieving over the death of their son Caleb, who died while serving overseas in the military. A man named David (Dan Stevens) shows up at the door unexpectedly, claiming to be an ex-soldier and a very close friend of Calebs, who he says asked David to check in on them before he died. They invite David to stay with them and he quickly bonds with the husband and wife (Sheila Kelley and Leland Orser) and their two remaining kids, teen Luke (Brendan Meyer) and twenty year-old Anna (Maika Monroe). Soon, though, when bodies start to pile up in town, it starts to become clear to Anna that the charming and handsome former solider may not be who he seems and is determined to find out just who they have welcomed into their house and what his real intentions are.

First of all, if nothing else, this film has a great 80s vibe, especially with Steve Moores electronic score, that evokes Tangerine Dream, and Robby Baumgartners cinematography. Second of all, the film is just a lot of fun. We know right from his first charming smile that this guy is not who he seems and that this devil wears an angels face. The fun is watching him charm himself into the Petersons life, telling them exactly what they want to hear about Caleb, saving Luke from school bullies and helping make dinnerall the while giving us, the audience, little glimpses that there is something far darker and far more lethal behind that boyish grin. Wingard gleefully and skillfully, lets us in on what this heartbroken family refuses to seeDavid is a dangerous and possibly unstable man. Once Anna starts to suspect, we know she is immediately putting herself in danger. And its even more fun when we find out just how much danger and just who David really is. I must say I didn't expect the film to go in the direction that Adam Wingard and scripter Simon Barrett take this story and its a blast to see it play out. There are some fun and shocking surprises along the way, too. What really makes it all work, though, is that its makers know exactly what kind of movie they are making here. They know exactly when to play it cool and exactly when to have some fun and go a little over-the-top. And the 80s vibe is definitely deliberate as certain scenes evoked the glory days of Seagal and Norris, had they played more villainous roles. Its not perfect. The Petersons seem a bit too eager to allow this stranger into their home, especially mom, Laura. Lukes willingness to go along with Davids deception, even after Anna suspects him of murder seems a bit far-fetched and leads to a betrayal thats a bit hard to swallow. Despite the two bonding, it seems quite a stretch that Luke would still trust David after all the suspicions and deceptions come to light. When we get the big reveal, we could have had a bit clearer picture as to what is going on with the ex-soldier, too. Its not vague but, a few more details would have been nice. Flaws aside, though, its a good time with some nice suspense and a thrilling and action-packed third act that keeps you from dissecting things too much till its overand by then youve had too good a time to be overly critical.

As for the actors, the cast are all very good. Dan Stevens almost fools us with his charming ex-soldier but, lets just enough of the devil in for us to know something is up. When the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, he is convincingly lethal when the bullets and blood start to fly. And it makes it even more fun to watch him keep the wool over the unsuspecting familys eyes. Maika Monroe is a nice surprise as the sweet but, strong-willed Anna. She has the look of a young Brittany Murphy and may just have the acting chops too. She plays a tough girl willing to go up against a possible killer to protect her family. Meyer is solid as the meek Luke. Hes the one who bonds tightest with David and obviously, is the last to believe David is dangerous to him and his family. Meyer conveys the confused emotions well when it starts to be believed that David is not who he seems. Kelley and Orser are also good as parents Laura and Spencer. Two adults that are too wrapped up in their own grief and lives to see something is definitely off with their guest. They convey that obliviousness and yearning to believe something is real to soothe their inner pain, even though its increasingly obvious its not. A good cast who take their roles seriously and make this flick work very well.

So, I really enjoyed The Guest. Even without some very heavy 80s influence on its story and style, this is just a fun movie that knows what its about and just goes with it in the right degreesand at the right times. We have a solid cast and some good direction by Adam Wingard that makes this story work, even when it sometimes asks for a little suspension of disbelief. The key here is Wingard knows that we know somethings up and he respects that weve seen a lot of this before and so he just has a good time telling the familiar tale and takes us along for the ride. And yes, Mr. Wingard, I saw the Halloween III easter eggwell played. A fun retro movie with a great soundtrack of songs, too!",1438473600,5,5282,4.420944558521561

6673702,4,B00NO834N0,"THE GUEST is ridiculousgloriously so.  One day, the ridiculously handsome David (DOWNTON ABBEYS Dan Stevens) shows up at the New Mexico home of a family grieving the death of their son overseas in combat.  David claims to have known the son, and is visiting the family at the dying request of their eldest.  The clueless mom (I guess we have to forgive her because shes grieving) invites David into the house, and soon, this charming, smooth, confident man has won the trust of mom, dad, young teen age son and teen daughter (Maika Monroe, lately of IT FOLLOWS).

Turns out there is more to this guest than they know.  David appears to be some sort of brilliant Special Forces officer with not much in the way of a conscience.  At first, he begins to right the wrongs perpetrated on this family by bullies, bad bosses, bad boyfriends, etc.  In one hilarious scene, he takes the underage son into a bar where his tormentors are hanging out, and swiftly and satisfyingly exacts physical damage on them.  It is a scene that satisfied on a gut levelseeing nasty folks get their comeuppance just never gets old!

But things take a darker turn soon, and the violence level swiftly ratchets higher and higher.  By the end, its a bloodbath, with David apologizing left and right for killing people.  He remains charming throughouthes gloriously ridiculous (and insane). Eventually a tiny smidgen of his background is revealed, and its just as dumb as could be.  I almost wish they had left him a charming, psychopathic enigma.

Some people will hate this movie.  You must buy into its brand of what I can only dub sarcastic violence or perhaps witty mayhem.  The movie NEVER takes itself seriously, even as the stakes increase.  Many characters act really stupidly.  In fact, the film sometimes comes off more like a slasher flick than an action film.  People in slasher films often make groan-worthy decisions, only to make it easier to get killed, it seems.  Well, we see a bit of that in THE GUEST as well.  Its a brutal, heartless and somehow witty slasher/action film.  I happened to enjoy the silliness of it all.  The deliberate abrupt shifts in tone and style.  The who cares if its stupid, aren't you having FUN!? attitude.

And best of all, the bonkers and yet completely controlled performance by Dan Stevens.  With his Texas accent, scruffy face and, of course, propensity to killStevens is a FAR cry from the world of Matthew Crawley.  But he brings an undeniable charm (even charisma) to David, and were it not for that, the film would be unwatchable.  The rest of the performances range from okay to dreadful.  The biggest missed opportunity, in my opinion, is that young Maika Monroe isn't quite up the challenge in her role as foil.  Much of the film she spends blank faced, in that way so many young actors these days seem to think conveys depth and gravitas.  This film does NOT call for that kind of subtlety.

I understand no liking THE GUEST.  But if you're ready for silly fun (and don't mind loads of violence), I think you can have a remarkably fun time inviting this film over for the night (sorry, bad pun on the title).  3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.",1434153600,2,3168,4.6606498194945845

Dan Stevens does something amazing in this movie, further distancing himself from his Downton Abbey days.  He gives a fantastic performance which is believable and deep.  The general plot of the film is great, but there is not much happening by the end of the film, leaving the exciting ending misplaced.  If there had been more happening throughout the film, more mystery and horrific action, the end would have hit so much harder.

Hell, I'm a fan of gun play and gratuitous violence - Smokin' Aces; Shoot 'Em Up; et al. Saw the trailer for this and it seemed it could be entertaining enough ... Until I started watching it. Slow burns are fine when there is a payoff however this dragged in takeoff and then never really went anywhere. Predictable; second rate acting (mostly lame script didn't help at all); and an overly brooding lead with Dan Stevens, who is capable as an actor though his talent really doesn't come through here.

After helping the youngest son fight off the school bullies and charming the pants of the daughters girlfriends, the main character starts to lose his grip as his secrets come to light.

This was similar to the Universal Soldier films from years ago except much better in so many ways. Although I like sci-fi films this is Universal Soldier without the science component of the story. What makes this film so attractive is that it will appeal to different members of the family. For teenagers it addresses school bullying and young love. For the parents it touches on the cooperate struggle and issues that a housewife and mother deals with when the family has issues. I don't give spoiler alerts but I will say that none of that is the primary purpose this film was made. Now to address those who like myself love action. This has hand to hand combat, rifles, hand guns, knife fights and explosions. There  are different vehicles used in the action sequences also. I would recommend adult supervision whenever children watch this film, not because of nudity or vulgar language but to explain that the Guest has improper problem solving solutions. In other words, make sure the children know that society has laws against solving their issues like the Guest, but it makes a very entertaining movie.

I'm not in the habit of giving away plot lines or discussing at length the entirety of the story. Those are not the kinds of reviews I like to write. But its not difficult to imagine what to expect with a title like The Guest.
A drifter comes knocking on your door and all sorts of interesting twists and turns start to happen.
As I said before, its very well executed. You'll be entertained without a doubt.
Why four stars then? Well, there are some holes in my opinion in the story, things I suppose that where left out for perhaps a sequel. I'm not the kind of viewer that needs everything to be explained, however, I felt that these things where left out because the writers didn't even know what they were. Sort of a stop-gap or straw-man approach to the story.

It actually had a great premise.  Guy returns from war in the Middle East and shows up on the door step of a woman and her family.  The family had recently learned their son was KIA in the same war.  May on door step was best friends with deceased and promised buddy just before he died, he'd check on his family and make sure they were OK.  But the dude is not what he appears and his motives are in question at least for the audience.  The family has no suspicions.  Suspicious guy had some runs with locals and throws them around like Barbie furniture.  At this point, I'm intrigued.  There's also a suggestion of some type of conspiracy/cover up with a secret government agency and tests done on soldiers.  Who was the son who died?  How'd he really die?  What did the shadow agency do to these guys and other soldiers?  For what purpose?  Even cooler!  But once the big secret is out, the makers of the film squander a great concept turning things into a very low, very low budge slasher flick.  The big set up is thrown away as if the film makers' planning meeting got cut short for a Vegas run.  The climax even goes down in a high gym with Halloween decorations and dry ice.

Maika Monroe and Brendan Meyer are excellent as the somewhat lost kids that initially accept the guest as a replacement for their lost brother but pull together for each other when things go south.

A son dies in Afghanistan. In one day one of his buddy soldiers, name Dave, shows up on the doorstep. The family takes a man as a guest and from that point there luck seems to turn for the better. Never mind the fact that people that impede their progress in life seem to be mysteriously dispatched.

The movie is a little slow in the beginning. However once you get to know the ""David"" you may come to love him. A dysfunctional family need a little spice to get them out of their funk. David is so charming he is to die for.

Dan excels as more of a modern day Billy Jack rather than being in a stuffy old Downton Abbey. O.K. maybe a tad of Jason tossed in. Dan seems comfortable in many characters.

I wish I could truly write what I know was wrong with this film, but it is probably as difficult as writing a good story. The recipe was good, the mixing was great, but something went wrong in the last part of baking it up into a good cake; eatable but something just doesn't taste right. I began to notice some off-putting lines and camera work that just didn't quite fit the jibe that had been developing along a seemingly recognizable path. I could tell the director was sure nudging in a not-so-slight new direction. However, a few steps off the path can at times be interesting, but it seems to me the journey just turned into some wrong turns and before I knew it I sensed the story had morphed, or maybe lapsed, into another destination, slight of target than where I thought we were going. Maybe it is just me, but maybe not. Honestly, in hind-site it seems like this was a Sunday afternoon matinee B movie that was just good enough to be foisted onto unsuspecting audiences in hopes some wouldn't notice what it was. I wish I could write this in less crude words, because the movie ain't bad; it just could have (what just seems ""easily"" I'm sure) been so much more of a story where all the parts supported each other. But I'm sure that keeping a story in line, especially when presenting it in movie form, is one of the most difficult jobs.

6673800,1,B00NO834N0,"Being a Dan Stevens fan, I was expecting a much better film.  His acting was pretty good, but it couldn't save the stupid plot.  I enjoy thrillers but this was just a stupid one.  Did I mention it was stupid?  When it began I had high hopes and thought it had a lot of possibilities and could possibly go off on a couple of paths, being about a psychopath terrorizing a family and some of their acquaintances.  But as the movie went on, the plot got worse, more and more ridiculous.  Honestly I think elementary school students could have written a better story.  It would be good to watch as a group, drinking at a party maybe so everyone could sit around and make fun of it.  Lots of violence, and only  vaguely described what the main character's problem was.  Sorry we rented it.",1428105600,,783,4.375

But it turns into an action movie halfway through. I prefer suspense movies to action movies but I liked both parts. The music adds to the suspense. The main actor had a sort of flat effect to his voice. Maybe that's because he's actually British but it worked for his psycho character.,1427241600,,426,4.4743589743589745

6673841,5,B00NO834N0,"This Dan Stevens film does not disappoint fans who missed him after he left the cast of ""Downtown Abbey"" so he could make other films. This action drama has him show up on the doorstep of a grieving family whose son was killed in Iraq. He is the VET buddy who says they served together and whose picture is on the wall with their son. It is the least they can do, to let him stay a few days as a guest in their home. His boyish  good looks and polite demeanor easily lulls the concern about having a stranger move in with the family. He ingratiates himself to members of the family as he seems protective and concerned about their problems. We know that there is something wrong here, but we like him so much we look for the clues to how this is not going to go well. We know instinctively, he is too good to be true. This is a really good action film and a study in mans' darker nature. We see the abnormalities that begin to show up in his protection of the younger brother, and we begin to guess this good looking guy is wired pretty tight. We can see things are not going to go well for this unsuspecting family as we see the darkness in his character begin to unfold.
  Stevens plays a real Schizoid in this film. He is so fascinating with his brooding eyes and physically such a hunk, we want to roll along and see what havoc he will do next. This actor has real charisma and women will flock to his films.  I give this one film a resounding FIVE stars.",1426291200,6,1459,4.144876325088339

The script was poorly written, the acting was comical, the fight scenes looked like a 5 year old choreographed them, and the soundtrack sounded like it was reused from an 80s cheap budget horror film. I cannot fathom how this movie has received positive reviews. Those who reviewed this movie must be mentally challenged or have very low expectations for a movie. How this movie didn't receive any Razzie nominations this year is beyond me. The only thing I found enjoyable about this movie was Dan Stevens in a towel.",1426204800,,614,4.590909090909091
6673849,4,B00NO834N0,"I rented this movie from Redbox, and after reading the plot summary, I confess I set my standards low.  Like, Lifetime movie low.  Here's what I expected: handsome, rugged, slightly off-kilter ex-soldier visit his deceased war buddy's family.  The Mom, understandably missing her son, welcomes him with open arms and starts baking cookies and is charmed by his knowledge of how to do laundry and wash dishes.  The Dad likes having around a pal he can talk to, the son likes having a tough and smart role model to teach him how to throw around the bullies at school, and the daughter, our heroine of the day, has rough edges and begrudgingly likes the rugged stranger for being someone she can talk to about her goals and dreams of growing up and doing more with her life than being a tough party girl.  Then, the body count in town begins, and our fearless heroine must race the clock to save the day.  Here's what I got: sure, a bit of the lifetime movie plot, but hey, there were twists!  And the acting wasn't terrible!  The music was great!  The final girl was a little more relatable, not a total bimbo, but not little miss perfect either.  Check it out, it makes a good B-movie chick flick.  I also thought Kill Bill was a great chick flick, but hey, to each their own!",1426204800,,1275,4.452586206896552

6673854,5,B00NO834N0,"I loved this film. I'm glad to see people on Amazon seem to get it far better than people on Netflix. It got a ton of bad reviews on Netflix. The film doesn't exactly spell things out. It leaves the audience to think for itself. That seems to bother some people who then give a bad review. Personally, I love suggestion and suspense rather than being spoon-fed a story.

Dan Stevens is amazing in this film. A total transformation from Downton Abbey. The film's creators designed it to be sort of Halloween meets Terminator. Watching Dan Stevens switch from boy-next-door to scary-emotionless-guy is captivating. He says more with a facial expression, or lack thereof, than many actors do with dialog.

The bar fight scene was hilarious! A little Bruce Campbell camp just for fun. I have to say the shifts between suspense and laughs really kept me glued to the screen.

I am going to give away a spoiler here because a lot of people on Netflix just didn't get it. The character of ""David"" is an engineered super-soldier. But unlike Captain America, David has a program he must fulfill. It's wicked fun to see him almost battle with himself when people he has come to care for become a threat due to his programming.",1426118400,,1216,4.6465116279069765

Only parts that were hard to watch were the Halloween Prom maze sequence, and the bad acting of the otherwise good actor Lance Reddick (the head of the ""military police"").

I guess most American viewers (spoiler alert) are not used to seeing a seemingly ""good"" guy turn bad. To best explain the plot of this great film imagine Drive (2011) intertwining with Universal Soldier (1992) with central male character looking and even dressing like Ryan Gosling from Drive, but with fighting skills of Jean-Claude Van Damme from the Universal Soldier.  The setting of the movie is some small, desolate and seemingly quiet town somewhere in New Mexico.  The only thing that is so 80's about this film, is the outstanding soundtrack and the school scenes.  Actually, the ending scene with the entire Halloween prom-night party kind-a-thing reminded me slightly of Carrie (1976).  For those who also like the soundtrack to this film I recommend Drive's (2011) soundtrack or such recently released albums like: Robin Schulz's Prayer, The Sound You Need vol. 1, Music at its finest,  and Odesza's In Return.  The song in the last scene entitled ""Anthonio (Berlin Breakdown Version)"" is originally a song by Norwegian pop-star Annie from her 2009 ""Don't Stop"" album.  The Berlin Breakdown Version of the song is good, but I think Fred Falke's remix sounds WAY BETTER. Check it out !!!",1424563200,2,1284,5.028301886792453

6673924,2,B00NO834N0,"Why couldn't the whole movie be shot like the first half?  I really thought this guy had been sent or decided himself to check on his dear friend's family after the friend was lost in the Iraq War.  Now THAT would have been a cool premise.  And that's how the first half of the movie goes...he shows up and is respectful and caring and considerate.  He tells the family that their son (brother) wanted him to give them the message that he ""loved him very much"".  So you're thinking it's going to be a Walking Tall type thing or a Rambo type thing or even a Taxi Driver type thing once the movie gets going (because it gets weird and not in a good way).  When he kills the mom that had lost her son, I turned it the freak off.

Dan Stevens is very nice looking and seems to be an excellent actor and has the ""crazy eyes"" thing down...but why the nutty script?  Very odd.  This could have been SO GOOD.  In fact, in retrospect, the part where ""David"" (Stevens) goes into the bar and knocks the crap out of the high school bullies was gold, Jerry, GOLD!

I rented it, watched it again right afterwards and knew I had to own it. Very strong supporting performances as well and just an incredible vibrant and cool vibe created with the sound track and visuals.

You have a guy named David whose a war vet who appears on the doorstep of a family's home. He is a friend who served with the family's deceased son. He's nice, helpful, and charming.  However, from the beginning something is off--PTSD, maybe. The audience is supposed to be in on the fact that he may not be telling the truth about certain things. The family is grieving so it makes sense for them not to notice the things the audience notices.

The audience and the family slowly start to get more information about David that's kind of where the plot dips. The action is still there [non- stop], the performances are still good, but the explanation given for David's behavior and mental state is confusing. It seemed like the movie took notes from Jason Bourne and X-Men's Weapon X program, with a side of ax-crazy. While not fleshed out fully, it's still a nice movie because the audience is meant to have fun, not think too deeply about who, when, what, and how.",1423526400,2,1209,4.4818181818181815
6673969,2,B00NO834N0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

Adam Wingard's thriller, ""The Guest,"" is guaranteed to do quite well at the box office. The first hour is actually taut and gripping: David Collins, an Afghanistan war veteran, insinuates himself into the Peterson household, consisting of the parents, Spencer and Laura, and the two teenagers, Luke and Anna. It's David's claim that he was friends with army buddy Caleb, the deceased Peterson son, that causes ditsy wife Laura to so easily trust him.

Spencer, a functional alcoholic, is a little more believable than wife Laura as he realistically is suspicious of David (he's worried that he might have PTSD and get violent). Eventually he too is charmed by David and welcomes him into his home. Luke is more of a nerd and is a victim of bullies at school and Anna has a pot-dealing boyfriend that her father can't stand. Although David is seemingly a malevolent figure, he sticks up for Luke at a bar, and pulverizes a few baddies that had picked on him earlier at school. But when David saved Anna's friend Kristen from an abusive ex-boyfriend and then asks her where he can buy some guns, we know David is no longer a friendly protagonist.

David continues to skirt the line between demented psycho and impressive vigilante when he kills a guy selling him guns (along with Kristen's friend, Craig, who really is an innocent bystander). David also does away with Spencer's supervisor at work (off screen), enabling the father to obtain a coveted promotion. David also frames Anna's boyfriend, Zeke, by placing the weapon he used to shoot the gun dealer, in the kid's car (also off screen). While he's not tied to the murder, Zeke is still arrested for drug possession. We still don't know what David's motives are, especially after he intimidates the dean of Luke's school, not to punish him too harshly for fighting back against one of the bullies who attacked him again, in class.

""The Guest"" devolves completely into a cheap gore fest when we find out that David was programmed to kill anyone who finds out that he was the product of a secret military program. David is no ""Terminator"" original but merely a psychopath who is immune to bullets (as well as a knife to the chest). One wonders why he didn't eliminate the Peterson family at the beginning but it appears that the film's scenarist wants to emphasize that he's a sadist at heart (that he enjoys playing with his victims). In the end, he ends up murdering the Peterson parents along with Anna's girlfriend, a military hit squad sent to eliminate him and other citizens in the town.

David is no longer the charming anti-hero by film's end but a very unpleasant killer. Though Anna and Luke seemingly dispatch him at the climax, it appears he lives again, walking out from the crime scene, dressed as a fireman. The science-fiction behind David's ability to survive bullets and knife wounds, is hardly explained at all and his overall motives are a cipher. Somewhere the film's scenarists simply ran out of clever ideas and the tension in the first hour is lost for the rest of the film. ""The Guest"" has some mild entertainment value until the second half, when it completely falls apart.",1423526400,2,3221,4.763440860215054

Mr. and Mrs. Peterson have just lost their oldest son Caleb in Afghanistan, and David says he was with Caleb when he was killed in action. David is welcomed, and decides to stay for a while at the Petersons.

David is quick to notice the younger son Luke is bullied at school. Always polite and dependable, David acts fast to do something about it, that is very drastic. There is something mysterious and even dangerous about the man, and thats what the teenage daughter Anna realizes, who gets more and more suspicious.

Directed by Adam Wingard (Youre Next), The Guest slowly builds up tension, unpredictable and rarely losing a step, until the final act where things suddenly fall apart.

The Guest does quite effectively what it sets out to do, but it doesnt know how to end it. Less is more would have been a better philosophy in revealing the truths about David, especially when Dan Stevens provides a very strong performance.",1422489600,5,1089,4.781914893617022

It's a super fun thriller that's filled with plenty of action and some horror movie elements as well.  But it also has a great sense of humor... it's not supposed to be taken super seriously.

Last two things about the movie I want to mention... the soundtrack is really terrific.  Sounds great on it's own, but in the context of the movie it's super effective.  The other thing is the acting... it was good on all accounts, but I was particularly impressed by Dan Stevens in the main role.  His character David is handsome, charming, and polite, but has  a real current of malice running belong the surface.

I have seen some people comparing this movie to Drive... I can see that.  The music has a similar feel and is used in a similar way in each film.

6673995,4,B00NO834N0,"This movie takes you from ""Hooray!"" to ""What the f*%$!?!"" really quickly and without any adequate explanation.  So, that's why you see a lot of negative reviews.  Basically the film feels like the writers could not decide if the main character was supposed to be an American Hero or an American Psycho.  Which really is a damn shame, because both versions of this character are riveting and frighteningly violent.  As a hero, he is a charismatic Punisher / Dexter.  As a villain, he is a an unpredictable Joker (without the giggles) / Vincent (from the Tom Cruise movie Collateral).

He could have been an excellent anti-hero being chased by the government, trapped by his vow to protect a fallen friend's family.  Instead we are not ever SURE what he is.  The government put him through a top secret program, tried to kill him, and now want him dead. But why?  What did they do to him?  What did he do ""wrong"" in their eyes?  What is this vow he has to protect the family?  Why does it get twisted?  WE NEVER GET TO KNOW.  IT NEVER MAKES SENSE IN THE END.

Top that off with an ending more appropriate for Universal Soldier than this film, and we end up with a confusing thrill ride that satisfies our lusts for adventure and violence but disappoints our intellects.

The Guest is LITERALLY half good guy movie and half crazy villain movie.  Who was in charge of this catastrophe?  Such a damn shame.  This movie had it all--great acting all around, great characterization, great camera work, superb violence.  I truly wanted to love it all the way through.  But this movie's stupid writers turned a possible HIT into a confusing roller coaster ride.

6674008,4,B00NO834N0,"THE FILM: From the director of YOU'RE NEXT comes an action-horror hybrid that has more than a few tricks up its sleeve. One day, a mysterious stranger (Dan Stevens) shows up at the doorstep of the Peterson family. He claims to have known their deceased son, Caleb, and says that he's just there to check up on them. However, things aren't quite what they seem and when bodies start turning up the daughter Anna starts to question who this guy really is. First off, I'll say that I really enjoyed the film. Tonally, it reminded me a lot of 80's horror movies, as well as with the structure. However, the soundtrack and score gave off the vibe of an action thriller. It was an interesting combination that made for a unique viewing experience. As far as the actual story goes, though, it wasn't too original but still effective in what it set out to do and a very enjoyable watch, in my opinion. Without going into spoilers, I'll say that a good comparison can be made with the original Terminator film. Also, in the sole featurette, the star Dan Stevens said he heard it described as ""Captain America gone wrong."" I'll let that stand on its own so as not to ruin it for the potentially interested. From a more technical standpoint, all of the action was well-staged and filmed, and quite brutal. Not quite horror-level violence, but still pretty intense for an action/thriller. Also, all of the performances were excellent. I'm not familiar with Dan Stevens work on DOWNTON ABBEY, but I'm pretty sure this role was a far cry from that. Overall, if you're a fan of indie action films that keep you guessing, you should have a great time with this.

THE EXTRAS: There isn't a whole lot of extra material, but what is there is suitable enough. There is 15 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary. What I gathered from those was that they trimmed some material for pacing issues, and one scene in particular was done in a different location for the finished film. There was also a two and a half minute Q&A with Dan Stevens in which he talks about himself playing against type and his preparation for the role. About a third of it consisted of clips from the film, so it amounted to little more than fluff. However, there is a feature-length commentary by the director, Adam Wingard, and the writer, Simon Barrett. Even if the other supplements didn't amount to much, this one thing is probably worth the purchase price (once you've watched the film by itself, of course).

OVERALL: I'd heard a lot of great things about this film despite nobody going into great detail about why. Now having seen it, I do agree that it's a good film, although I'd hesitate to heap too much praise on it other than being a thrilling genre exercise. The special features on this Blu-ray aren't terribly substantial, but should satisfy viewers who go for that sort of thing. Overall, I have no issues recommending this to fans of indie films, and it's certainly a lot better than some of the big action movies that go into wide theatrical releases these days.",1421798400,,3046,4.628465804066543
6674009,4,B00NO834N0,"If I recall, this little film breezed through my town, in one week, in one theater.  Then went to DVD.  You might remember director Adam Wingard from his very good home invasion slaughter-fest ""You're Next.""  He mixes goodly amounts of dark humor into his twisty films.  And this is no exception.

The film opens somewhere in a remote, dusty town in the American west.  David Collins shows up at the doorstep of the Peterson family.  David is played by Brit, Dan Stevens who many will recognize from TV's ""Downton Abbey"" but I also remember him from a fine supporting role in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" David says he served with the Peterson's late son in the Middle East.  David is ever-so-polite and quite charming.  The family consists of matriarch, Laura (Sheila Kelley, TV's ""Lost""), 20 year old Anna (Maika Monroe, ""Labor Day""), 15 year old Luke (Brendan Meyer) and patriarch, Spencer (Leland Orser, ""Taken 2"").

David is invited to stay over as he is between a job and home, having been recently discharged.  He says the Peterson son had asked him to convey his love for his family shortly before he was killed.  One night turns into a few more and David integrates himself in with the family.  Only Anna smells something isn't right and begins to investigate.  Stevens is really good in this role as he changes personalities from time to time.  What doesn't change is his quiet smirk.  You'll be rooting for him early on as he dispatches a handful of Luke's high school bullies.  But that will change as he uses his lethal Army training to ""help"" the family and a friend with innocuous domestic issues.

The film has its share of typical movie stupidity.  For example, a squad of armed-to-the-teeth professional soldiers are taken by surprise, when there was clearly no reason to be surprised.  These are the ones who are just a touch too slow on the trigger.  And then can't seem to hit anything except a house.  Still, some solid acting and creative action makes for a highly entertaining ""B"" movie.  Recommended.",1421798400,,2027,4.744985673352436

The story of a charming but slightly 'off' U.S. veteran visiting the family of a fallen brother in arms, director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett's ""The Guest"" is an ode to the early work of James Cameron and John Carpenter. It has a similarly vitality and originality. This film's mix of action and slasher genres is not for everyone, especially if you're not a fan of dark, dry humor, the trademark of the makers of this film (their previous film, ""You're Next"", was a similarly brilliant, genre-mixing classic). I believe viewers looking for another version of a film they've already seen (e.g. the recent ""Star Wars"" imitation, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", which was terrific but just added Gunn's humor to the space opera genre), might find this to be an olive-for-a-grape situation, but if you know you ain't getting a ham sandwich heading in, the fusion cuisine you're served will delight.

I recommend watching it with as few plot details as possible, as it allows the turns the plot takes and Dan Stevens's star-making performance as the mysterious war veteran David Andersen Collins to really captivate. (If Stevens becomes the next big thing in the coming decade, this will be the film that will be seen as his break-out role.) Maika Monroe and Brendan Meyer are similarly good as the siblings of the fallen soldier that are curious/suspicious of their family's new house guest, and Leland Orser (a character actor you'll recognize from his many small roles, including memorable but minute parts in Taken and Se7en) is hilarious as the family's functional-alcoholic but middling patriarch.

""The Guest"" is a fantastic, fun, and funny film: one of the best of 2014.",1421280000,2,2155,4.980555555555555
6674031,2,B00NO834N0,"This movie starts off playing it fairly straight as an action thriller and then builds to a progressively weirder and more melodramatic ending that literally climaxes in a cheesy Halloween funhouse with fog machines and disco music.

The campiness could be fun, if it weren't so abrupt. If the movie just said ""hey, this is a Tank Girl / Shining / Breakfast Club mashup"" from the beginning, maybe embraced comic book-style graphics, ""So I Married and Axe Murderer"" humor, etc, it would be fun. But when you think you're watching a Bourne Conspiracy straight-laced action movie for 3/4 of the film, and then it suddenly turns in to a bad soap opera, it's just annoying and lame.",1421193600,,677,4.786324786324786
6674032,4,B00NO834N0,"I didn't know what to expect, but within minutes I knew what this movie was. It opens with an interesting scene, and continues to be interesting after that, as it moves from one scene to another, and as you try to figure out the main character. It's a cliche story, really, but with a fresh, tongue in cheek twist.  The good guys do unbelievably stupid things, and the bad guys do what they do in all movies. It's over the top, but that was intentional.  The violent scenes are so sudden and violent that it's hard to take them seriously, but you still take them seriously. All the acting is good. The script is fast moving and good.  What's most interesting about the main character is that he's bad, but not ALL bad. Or is he?

If you've seen the lead actor from his stint in Downton Abbey, you'll be surprised at this guy's persona on screen. Gone is the gentle, caring, handsome British actor. This is a buff, manipulative, intense, mysterious, diabolical, highly capable M-A-N, whose eyes can mesmerize everyone he meets.

A good movie. As long as you recognize it's intended to be over the top, and you don't take it too seriously. It even has some dark humor. It's just plain fun escapism. You'll love to get angry at the good guys for being so stupid in their actions (I won't tell you how, so as not to give it away).

6674036,4,B00NO834N0,"Sometimes a film has the opportunity to decide, within a split moment, what genre path its going to take.  The Guest is one of those types of movies.  It has everything in its arsenal to be this grand, Blockbuster action flick, and yet it chose to dial all of that down and become this slow burn of a psychological thriller, and for the most part it succeeds because of it.

While watching The Guest, I couldn't help but call to mind films like The King and A History of Violence, two films that I feel The Guest pulled influence from, both in tone and in construction of prose.  Theres a coolness here though, a real modern flare of tonal effortlessness and undeniable swagger that permeates this film, giving it an air of Drive while evoking the great works of Jean-Pierre Melville (if you aren't familiar with his exceptional contribution to French cinema, Google him now).  The Guest doesnt hit every mark, mostly due to a few script issues, but so much of this works that it almost doesnt matter.

And MY GOD, Dan Stevens is incredible here (but more on that in a minute).

How many films have we seen now where the main protagonist/antagonist introduces himself as a friend of a deceased family member only to wreak havoc on innocent lives in the process?  A lot of them.  Its extremely predictable at this point.  The moment that David shows up in the Petersons lives, we know that trouble is eminent.  We don't know, or expect, how much trouble, and I have to say that I wholly commend writer Simon Barrett and Adam Wingard for having thegallto go as far as they did with this movie.

They went far.

The film follows David as he imposes (without given the impression of imposition) on the Peterson family, claiming to have served with their son and been with him with he died overseas, and claims to have made a promise to him that he would look after his family.  Laura, the deceaseds mother, is immediately taken with him and offers him her sons bedroom for as long as he needs it.  The rest of the family is skeptical, for a while at least.  Soon, Davids cool charisma wins them over and they are invested in him and his journey until Anna, the daughter, uncovers secrets she would do well to ignore.

Too late.

Cue the bloodbath and watch the Petersons world crumble in the last twenty minutes of the movie, culminating in some of the richest, most intense visual identity Ive seen in a film in a very long time (that layer of smoke on the floor gave me heart palpitations).

There are snags here and there, especially concerning the clichd way in which Davids storyline is broached (I mean, experiments, really?) but the way that the actors and the director tackle every moment here is jaw-dropping.  The supporting cast does well with the material, with Maika Monroe coupling her angsty teenager with her paranoid abrasiveness well, but really, this is all about Dan Stevens.  I feel shamed to say that I had no idea who he was before this.  Ive never seen Downton Abby (I know, I knowI need to) and so his name meant nothing to meuntil now.  This performance is EVERYTHING!  He reminded me so much of Matthew Goode in last years Stoker, and we all know how much I loved him in that.  This performance is everything that Ryan Gosling SHOULD have done in Drive (I loved the film, but was always underwhelmed by his performance).  The way that he shifts from manipulative nice-guy to calculated killer is incredible to watchthe facial shifts, the narrowed eyes, the widened grin, and when his backstory is revealed it makes so much more sense.  Its such a layered and complex performance and one that could have easily fallen off the tracks and delved into absurdity or even campiness, and yet Stevens never allows that.  He has complete control over every tick, and it works.  Hes absolutely terrifying.

With stunning cinematography (especially in those final scenes) and a score that is pitch perfect for this kind of film, The Guest is the kind of film you wish would get more attention.  I mean, why are people flocking to see those Transformer things do the same thing they did in the last five movies?  Why don't general audiences even KNOW about this movie?

This movie has some nice action/fight scenes that seem to be aided by special effects. The writing and storyline are mediocre at best which leaves the viewer with a lot of ups/downs. Story development is a mix of scenes with poor interconnectivity. There also seems to be a fair number of implausible scenes.

The acting is also weak. It's not easy to give a great performance when the writing is poor.

The ending is completely unrealistic.

So, is there enough quality action to overcome the lacking storyline? Barely, because the action/fight scenes are not that top quality.

One sex scene with some top/frontal female nudity. Not very graphic. Language is mostly clean.

The soundtrack was music I have never heard from artist I don't know. The music wasn't irritating and I barely remember it.

My favorite part of the movie: It was nice to see Lance Reddick/Detective Broyles from ""Fringe"" again.

At best, this movie ranks a 3. Its ok. I watched it til the end. Although many of the fight scenes had fake looking action, I still kinda liked them.

Dan Stevens did do a great job playing both creepy and charismatic-often at the same time.  And to play in the shallow end of the pool he did look fantastic.

As for the story, it's familiar and clich: a mysterious stranger claiming to be the best friend of a slain soldier in Iraq integrates himself with the dead man's family, including his sexy daughter, bullied son and depressed mom.  He moves in and changes their lives for the better.  Unfortunately, people around them also start dying like flies.

Thanks to Stevens' charm and deadpan delivery, however, this creaky, predictable plot is both scary and funny.

The cast led by Dan Stevens (solidly cast as ""David"") & Maika Monroe (as Anna Peterson) is excellent. The directing and film editing by Adam Wingard is excellent. The story & screenplay by Simon Barrett (also executive produced) is excellent.

The music by Steve Moore is excellent. The cinematography by Robby Baumgartner is excellent. The casting by Nicole Daniels & Courtney Bright is excellent. The production design by Thomas S. Hammock is excellent. The set decoration by Susan Magestro, set dressings by Amelia Salas, Eduardo Reyes, Dale Lotreck, Tommy Lewis, Jorge Reyes, Michael Vetter, Charles J. Sandoval, Anthony Harker, James E. Stafford, Jr., Louie Martinez & George Estill is excellent. The costume design by Kathleen Detoro is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Clayton Barber is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Scott Hastings & David Nami is excellent. The visual effects supervised by Dimitri Loginowski is excellent. The make-up effects by Galaxy San Juan is excellent.

This is an excellent, well-crafted (well-made) entertaining movie that is interesting and intriguing (also as it goes along, as well, too). This is also an excellent follow-up (to ""You're Next"") from Adam Wingard & Simon Barrett, that is possibly even better than that movie. Dan Stevens has left a solid mark as David. This is one of the best movies of the recently-done fall season and also one of the best thrillers of the year, as well.",1420588800,,1728,5.077464788732394

The plot resolution isn't actually the main issue with the ending, however, it's the shift in tone, flat-out bizarre direction (*thumbs up* anyone?), and yes, the acting. That said, the acting throughout the movie holds your attention: the lead, as well as the family he stays with, are spot-on throughout. The sound track is a mix of classic and obscure synth pop, EBM, goth, and late 80's industrialfor fans of those genres, you're definitively in for a treat. Overall, I'm a sucker for the real-life super hero kind of lead (think Jack Reacher, Bourne Supremacy, etc.) and during parts of the film the many comparisons to Drive amongst the reviewers certainly feel apropos. It's not a great film, but I kind of loved it. If you're even entertaining this sort of film (say you've watched the trailer and are still interested), then my guess would be you're going to enjoy it. Go in with sober expectations, know that a few things at the end will feel tonally off, and you should be nicely prepped for a pleasant surprise.",1420502400,,1149,4.693069306930693

  And the story unfolds about David (Stevens) nice and slow so you never know who exactly has been let in the Peterson home until the movie feels like letting you know. I'm glad it takes awhile to get answers since that's what I like about it. Since despite David's charm he is clearly dangerous but is he a danger to the Peterson family is the question ? Since he does seem to want what's best for them.
  Slight Spoiler: Not everyone will appreciate the film since it does get silly in the end. And I myself wanted more answers about David that we didn't get.

Why did I see The Guest? Because it was written and directed by the guys behind You're Next, one of my favorite horror films of recent years. Part of my love for You're Next stemmed from the ability of Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett to subvert audience expectations through twists and reversing character cliches. Although The Guest is being touted as a satire by some, I'd say the duo have taken a step backwards as far as creativity goes. The Guest is about family who take in David, a man who was in the same army troop as their deceased son. Although he is courteous to the family, David loses their trust after they learn of his mysterious past, and when bodies begin turning up around town. The entire film, I was waiting for a twist, or just something clever to make The Guest unique, and it never really came. Barrett delivered what is a surprisingly straightforward script that makes for undeniably compelling viewing, but is sadly routine. David is made out to be a weirdo, and he is. Nothing really shocking is revealed about David that would make for an exciting twist. All that's told about him is that he was tested on by the government and is now a cold-blooded killer. They had the opportunity to tell us he was an alien, or a cyborg, or something else cool, but they chose a bit of a cop-out in comparison. Although the script could have been more exciting, and it had a few jarring genre/tonal shifts, The Guest is a well-made film, more-so than You're Next. The cinematography is more professional, the acting is improved, and the soundtrack could be a cult classic all on its own. Dan Stevens is mesmerizing as the psychotic David. His gorgeous eyes and inviting smirk go a long way to give his character a degree of likability, but Stevens is still totally convincing as a maniac. Maika Monroe and Brendan Meyer give above average performances as the children of the film. The synth-heavy soundtrack works splendidly, especially in the darker, John Carpenter-inspired scenes. The entire ending in the school's haunted house was great, albeit a little out-of-place in a distracting, self-aware type of way. It's one of those endings that didn't feel organic, but was well-done nonetheless and probably my favorite part of the movie. It pains me to say it, but the Guest is a good film, nothing more, nothing less. The truth is that it just isn't that special in the way that You're Next was special. I wouldn't call it a sophomore slump, but a modest success in the wake of a minor cult classic.",1413331200,5,2533,4.666666666666667

It is extremely frustrating, and I cannot  recommend this movie if you have a thing for him. Bah! Just get it.",1530748800,,290,4.2727272727272725

8679481,5,B00NO834N0,"Another diamond in the rough! ""The Guest"" is a heart-stopping thriller with twists and turns from beginning to end. Dan Stevens (as the guest) is brilliant. This must have been lost in a stream of films back in 2014. If you like to be thrilled, entertained and challenged with a plot, this one is for you. But remember, he's just a ""family friend"". Yeah, right! All 5 stars.",1529971200,,374,4.514705882352941
8679482,5,B00NO834N0,"As a recent fan of Dan Stevens, this was recommended to me the weekend before this review goes up. I saw that Amazon had the Blu-ray for reasonable price so I ordered it. The cover makes the movie looks like any other drifter with gun movie. After watching it, The Guest is far more than a ""person ingratiate's themselves to their surroundings for nefarious reasons"" kind of movie. It has humor, shockingly good action scenes, and horror elements that work surprisingly well. This is a well crafted drama that should be seen by more people.",1529280000,,540,4.6947368421052635
