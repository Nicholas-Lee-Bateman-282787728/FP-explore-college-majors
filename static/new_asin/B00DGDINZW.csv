8592947,5,B00DGDINZW,"I watched this 50 minutes documentary with all social tango dancer friends. We all agreed that this documentary captures the essence of ARGENTINIAN TANGO.  Chan Park understands TANGO and emphasized  that is not about steps and the outside. On the contrary, it is about the inner self and who you are as entire human being. TANGO reflects, represents your essence.  The way you interpret TANGO, it is the expression of your soul.  I recommend this documentary to all social TANGO dancers that  are serious about  making an effort to enlighten our inner-self, here and now. In summary, this documentary conveys  that TANGO DANCING allows us to capture life, revolutionizing  our soul and spirit.",1410739200,2,694,5.079646017699115
8592948,5,B00DGDINZW,Tango Your Life captured the essence of Argentine Tango. The special quotes used in the subheadings of the film embellished the essence of the documentary. The faces of the people dancing tango vis a vis expressions of the Buddha added to the film's artistry as tango is a meditative experience. The film-maker touched the true meaning of Argentine Tango. The film is a not miss for every beginning and experienced student of the dance,1374364800,,435,4.891891891891892
8592949,5,B00DGDINZW,"Oh wow - 'scuse the passion - but this is THE GREATEST TANGO FILM in 25 YEARS! Chan Park is the creator of Tango Zen, a one-time resident of Bs. As. This very touching documentary about the last of the Porteo Tangueri is a MUST SEE! I love my tango dvds collection (over 75 dvds on tango) but this surpasses all the others. 'Scuse the over-used hyperbole but it IS this simple; if you want the secret, buy this! Yes, I know, sorry ... that is so over-used and abused, the idea that there are secrets and you can ""buy"" them but this films demonstrates the 'secrets' quite freely and happily - you see it shows real tango dancers from just before the xerox-tango age (now), from whom the first generation of xerox-tango teachers borrowed everything they knew (and there's plenty more they forgot/ ignored).  If you have only enough money for one tango dvd buy this  - it's as instructional (in ways you would never be taught until you'd paid your last dime) as the best of the rest, yet also deeply social - this may have been the last chance to get this valuable archive together, and Chan has done very well! Chan Park, you deserve the golden key to Bs As!",1373932800,2,1156,4.397196261682243

I had the opportunity recently to view Chan Park's new film, Tango Your Life. As a person who teaches a class about tango, at my university, I am always looking for good documentaries to show my students. This is one that I will buy as soon as it becomes available.

The film allows dancers to tell their stories, not about how they came to tango but what it means to them. Chan thus addresses the appeal of tango, that for those who love tango, the dance is a way to live and live fully. To explore this perspective, Chan Park presents separate sections that capture different significant elements of the dance. He includes clips from interviews with dancers from Buenos Aires and around the world and scenes from milongas and beautiful images of the city. The various commentary, dance montages, and images capture the spirit of this beautiful and additive dance. The section on the cabeceo is one of the best explanations of this uniquely Argentine means of communicating I have seen. And, the filmed illustrations are funny and touching.

Chan Park is the author of the book Tango Zen: Walking Dance Meditation. The film, while not explicitly about Buddhism, nonetheless is infused with the perspective. Images of Buddha introduce sections and many of the comments of the people he interviewed address the appeal of tango in its meditative nature. Especially compelling is the section in which the filmmaker splits the screen so that on one side he shows the faces of dancers on the other images of the Buddha. The effect is an elegant illustration of the meditative quality of the dance!

Throughout, the film demonstrates the best that tango can be--fulfilling, contemplative, collaborative, spiritual, respectful, and enchanting.
