8356375,5,B0028MDFVY,"This is an excellent DVD for anyone who has never had any striking instruction (ie/layman or a wrestler/grappler). The material is heavy on protecting the striker (ie/ defense) from openings that can lead to a counterstrike. It covers hand and shoulder positions as well as how to make a proper fist for bare-knuckle strikes. The elbow and knee instruction are basic and easily learned. The kicking material follows strictly a low line of attack to the opponent. All of the strikes are for doing damage to the opponent or setting up a shot or throw. If you use this method as a foundation for striking, I cannot see how one can go wrong since the material leans heavily on defense for the striker. Highly recommended.",1308441600,2,717,4.744
