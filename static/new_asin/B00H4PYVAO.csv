To be fair there are two movies or something. What they are i'm not 100% sure because the ones I've found here on Amazon don't come with English subtitles. I'm waiting for them to be in that. I really like... ok I love most all of the different Kamen series. That's why I don't hate this one. If you set all the top stuff I wrote aside then let me say that, the stories are good , the fights are good , and the dry humor is good to.",1479168000,,580,3.965811965811966
