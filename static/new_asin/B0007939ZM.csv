Starts off where she is mentally abused basically be her ""careless"" mother, and is locked in her room while her mother parties, while she is screaming her father comes in and comes to her side, then it jumps to a little later off in her teen years, she comes home from school, her father gives her a gift, and is then arrested for a ""set up mob murder"", while she knows he is innocent, she fights for years for his freedom, while in the time she has 2 little girls. Then one day she goes to see her father in jail and meets this man that tells her everything. As she tries to help her father be free, she goes under cover for the cops to bring the big man down for other stuff,  If in return her father is set free. She does what she is supposed to do, almost gets killed a few times... as for the rest you should need to watch it cause I am not telling the ending...",1270080000,,1005,3.9507389162561575
