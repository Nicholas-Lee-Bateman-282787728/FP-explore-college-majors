2627883,5,B000H5V8D6,"I'll keep this short - Season 5 rocks.

It has everything fans of this show have come to love and expect: new and exciting characters, shocking twists, awesome music, brilliant writing & acting, and everything else that makes great dramatic televison. Jennifer Garner is absolutely phenominal in the role of Sydney Bristow, our now-pregnant heroin. She co-stars with a superb cast, which includes Victor Garber, Rachel Nichols, Ron Rifkin, Lena Olin, Carl Lumbly, and many others.

This season is a major step-up from the previous two years, and although it is not without its faults, it's pretty damn good. Pre-order NOW!",1154304000,4,622,5.148514851485149
2627884,5,B000H5V8D6,"In season four, the major downfall was that Sydney had no drive. She had nothing to guide her, or push her through the season... nothing for us to cheer her on for. In season 5, she has more drive than ever.

After waking up to discover Vaughn has been abducted and is now assumed to be a double agent, Sydney's life is turned upside down. Soon, she discovers she is pregnant with his child, and at the hands of those who killed his father, Vaughn is brutally gunned down before Sydney's eyes. This launches an investigation into the series' most nefarious organization yet: ""Prophet Five"", an international terror network, which has embedded itself within several government agencies - including the CIA.

Sydney, now, must uncover the truth behind Vaughn's past (With the help of new cast edition Renee Riene, a dangerous criminal from Vaughn's investigation), train a new protge with a history chillingly close to her own, and cope with the realization that her spying capabilities are no longer what they used to be... and that she may be a single mother.

Each character is given an intruding sub-plot, ala season 1-3. Sloane struggles to obtain a cure for Nadia, who is still comatose after the Sovogda incident. However, his journey leads to dark places, as those with a cure, ""Prophet Five"", offer him a short cut... a deal comes with some shocking consequences.

Jack struggles to protect his daughter, while fearing that Vaughn's betrayal may have the same effect on Sydney as Irina's had on Jack. Not only that, but he must cope with the fact that he will soon be a grandfather... while still learning how to be a decent father.

Marshall is hilarious, Dixon is helpful and caring, and the newbies (Rachel Nichols, Balthazar Getty, Elodie Bouchez) provide a much-needed rejuvenating aspect to this final season. Nothing is safe - which first becomes evidently clear in the 7th episode, as our one clear villain is murdered right before our eyes.

There are cliffhangers, jaw-droppers, and tearjerkers. The finale is awe-inspiring and near perfect. While it was sad to see this show go, it was time. The final season is right up there with the first two... true appointment television.",1154304000,,2195,4.887096774193548
2627885,5,B000H5V8D6,"From the outside looking in, Alias is a series about a sexy female spy (Jennifer Garner) and her never-ending array of outrageous wigs, exotic missions, and sexy outfits. Look for season five to prove the stereotype wrong. When the fifth season debuted in September 2005, fans were weary - how would they deal with Jennifer Garner's pregnancy? And in true ""Alias"" style, it was shocking, poignant, and series defining.

From the very first episode, series creator JJ Abrams made Alias' mission distinctively clear - it was a show about family and friendships, both loving and dysfunctional, heartbreaking and real. The shows main character, Sydney Bristow, just happened to be a spy.

Picking up where season 4 left off (after a devastating car crash, and a telling confession on Michael Vaughn's part) season five navigates through the loss of several main characters, the introduction of new ones, and the return of beloved characters from the past (Bradley Cooper, Lena Olin, and Gina Torres all make memorable appearances).

The season's best quality is, of coarse, the family aspect. Sydney grapples with the idea that she may raise her child alone, and as she mentors a new agent and deals with varying dire circumstances, the only true ally she has is her father, Jack (Brilliantly portrayed by Victor Garber).

With just 17 episodes (cut down from the average 22, due to Garner's maternity leave) each packs an especially strong punch. Stories from the first 4 seasons resurface, relationships change, break, reform, and implode... and with the final 8 episodes, nothing (and no one) is safe. As characters begin to drop like flies, Rambaldi's true endgame presents itself. If Sloane was once interested in Rambaldi for his wife's sake, he no longer is, and Rambaldi's other follows become particularly malevolent.

The final two-hour episode is fantastic - exactly what it has to be. While some fans were left jilted due to a certain characters turn to the dark side, I was thoroughly pleased. Watch the first four seasons back, and you will discover that everything was foreshadowed. Nothing happens by accident, and everything has a hidden meaning. Rambaldi's endgame comes together (although the fans are left to put together the pieces) and everything is tied up in a bow... for the most part.

Alias' fifth season - as with the entire series - is absolutely fantastic. Brilliant writing, fantastic acting (Carl Lumbly, particularly, is underrated in his role as Sydney's partner and confidante, Marcus Dixon), and a truly talented crew all work together to make the series one of the best in recent television history. The characters are real, and while situations are outrageous and seemingly unbelievable, they are always exciting and riving.

Dramatic television at it's best.",1154217600,12,2793,5.138766519823789
2627886,4,B000H5V8D6,"The Final Season / The Last Stand

 By the time the fifth season of `Alias' came onto the airwaves, the fans knew something was up:  Jennifer Garner had suddenly become a box-office actress (and a soon-to-be mother), J.J. Abrams had his hands full with `Lost' and `Mission Impossible 3,' and the series was finally starting to show signs of its age (which included a rather large dip in the ratings), and it came to no surprise really when Abrams and Garner jointly announced that the show would not return pass its May Finale.

 Despite the fact that the show now had an expiration date (and the episode order was cut from 23 to 17), Garner and company seemed to get really into these last episodes, giving them everything they had and actually brought the quality back to the early years.  Early in the season the regular cast went through a large overhale, getting rid of two older characters and bringing in four fresh-faced rookies... And with the new cast (and the storyline of Sidney growing up and becoming a mother) brought some much needed new blood into the series.

 In the form of a plot this final year focus's mainly on Syndey Bristow growing up and learning about all the responsibility's that come with life.  She was thrown a heavy and heart-wrenching curve in the first season, and throughout the entire season she feels the repercussions from it, realizing that she is not invincible, she isn't as young as she used to be, and that her actions affect more people than just herself.  So Sydney kinda moves into a mentoring position training and working with two new members to APO, and essentially passing the reigns off to them (it was mentioned that if the show had gone to a sixth season, Garner would have left the show and these characters would have become the main focus).

 Since this is a final season, that means that included is not only the series finale, but the 100th episode as well.  With only 17 episodes, the 100th episode was the fifth from the last and essientially served as a `reboot' for the series taking the story from the first 12 episodes and bringing it into the home stretch... especially by bringing back old foes and friends including Sark, Anna, Will, and a few other 'surprise' returns... while the final 4 episode successfully tied up 99% of the loose ends left throughout the series, by the final episode the audience was still left a little confused, but I think in a good way, because if this show proved anything it was that nobody really understands what is going on in their own life.

 Season five, while not as strong as the first two season's is definitely a step-above the third and fourth seasons, and highly recommended.  Note also that on the same day a ""complete series"" set will be coming out, so if you don't have any of the episodes, that might be the way to go...",1154217600,132,2834,4.604373757455268

2628106,5,B000H5V8D6,"For those who missed this series, starring, and making a star out of , Jennifer Garner, it was on opposite 24. Every episode. The ultimate counter programming between ABC(Alias) and FOX(24). So, Alias flew under the radar, except for those of us rabid fans who saw the future of TV in this series. The long form storyline.

Just like LOST, the series needs to be told from the pilot. Every year has a stand-alone story, but the entire series builds a mythology of double agents, CIA/SD-6 warfare, and the myth of Rimbaldi, a DaVinci like prophet that predicts ...Well, that is a spoiler.

Unlike LOST, the last year, the finale of the series, is completely satisfying. I remember the message boards, people crying with sorrow and joy as favorite characters, good and evil, get their karma paid. Watch the series from year 1, build a relationship with Sydney, Sloane, her Dad and the rest, and you too will be satisfied with the ending.

One more thing. The villains. No character in this series is one dimensional. There are times you will cheer for Arvin Sloane, the big baddie of the series. Because you will understand his obsession. An adult series.",1391299200,2,1153,4.755

All the actors were so perfect for this series.  Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow was great  with her agent toughness and girlish, sensitive side.  The conflicts in dealing with her parents (Victor Garber and Lena Olin) and their secrets were compelling.  Ron Rifkin as the not-sure-who's-side-he's-on Arvin Sloane was so perfect.  Bradley Cooper as her good friend, and Michael Vartan as her love, were eye candy for us females, while they fought the bad guys and had that sensitive side we love.

2628162,4,B000H5V8D6,"The 5th season seems out of focus, no real direction.  Having Jennifer Garner being pregnant ""slowed"" things down. But expected under the circumstances.  Pulling in another actor to ""fill in"" for her is nothing new.  Rachel Nichols did her part as well as one could expect.  But to go through another layer of SD-6, The Shed, is getting old.  And then to further complicate the issue unnecessarily,  they introduce Prophet Five, sinister organization created purely for the pursuit of unimaginable power of Rambaldi.  As everyone knows that if the network didn't decide to pull the plug, this story line would continued. Whether that would have worked or not, we will never know. 2 hour final episode tied up the loose ends but it seemed uncharacteristically flat and uninteresting.

My favorite part of the Alias series was watching Sydney Bristow dress up in outrageous costumes and kick some bad guy butt. Unfortunately, she's pregnant in season 5 (Jennifer Garner was in real life) and the show just wasn't the same. The other characters in the show take more important roles, and the Rambaldi story line gets even more outrageous, which I didn't even think was possible.

2628196,2,B000H5V8D6,"I agree with the review from reviewer Chris Conway in that Alias Season 5 lacked depth and character involvement since Michael Vartan (Vaughn) and Greg Grunberg (Weiss) left the show. You could tell Alias was falling apart by not only their departure, but the fact that J.J. Abrams was preoccupied and focused on developing the show ""LOST"" and working on perfecting the movie ""Mission: Impossible 3"" (the best Mission: Impossible movie ever made). In a way, Jennifer's pregnancy did detract from the show's entertainment and her ability to do action scenes (i.e. martial arts), as evidenced by her character's sudden lack of said action scenes. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the addition of new characters were meant to replace and fill-in the void left by the departure of 2 of the show's essential characters (i.e. Vaughn and Weiss). I suppose it was fate and meant to be that Alias lasted only 5 seasons, since during the dismally dreadful 4th season, the other epic J.J. Abrams show ""LOST"" debuted. If the 5th season of Alias had the same character development, captivating plots, suspense, and twists and turns as seasons 2 and 3, perhaps it would have done better, but the departure of Vaughn and Weiss and Sydney's lack of action scenes sealed the fate of this cult show.",1372032000,,1284,4.921658986175115

with the story arc, this season really FIXED that.
I love this season, but I get mad when a series knows it ending,and rather
than leaving the characters to move on in life. so to speak, the writers decide
to kill everyone they possibly can in some kind writers tantrum.
This season is a great ""action"" movie every episode, but J. Garner doesn't
really seem like she enjoyed playing Sydney Brtistow the way she did before,
and it's kind of obvious. But hey, it another seson of ALIAS we might not have had,

2628224,4,B000H5V8D6,"OK, first things first.  Alias remains one of the best series to hit TV in a long, long time.  Rarely does a series come along to match it.  The first four seasons were remarkable, keeping me on the edge of my seat every episode with action, intrigue, and emotion.  That said, the last season suffered from two challenges that were very hard to overcome.  Michael Varten went prima donna, and Jennifer Garner got pregnant.  I don't blame either actor for wanting to move on in life, but these actions challenged the premise of the show.  So in a bid to wrap up the story lines new actors were brought in for one season and did well.  Sydney was nursed along with her pregnancy.  Michael was brought in when necessary and given ""Special Guest Star"" billing.  And the show was still excellent, but not as great as the first four seasons.  And yet, it remains in the pantheon of my all time favorites as a series.",1369785600,,910,4.454545454545454

To think that anyone would buy into such a ridiculous plot twist is insulting. I feel sorry for the actors who were subjected to play out this mockery - actors who played their roles very well in the beginning.

2628227,3,B000H5V8D6,This season totally jumped the shark. It was the last one so it had to be watched just to complete the series. Not much reason too though b/c the story line is very disjointed and many changes don't work.,1368921600,,204,4.256410256410256
2628228,5,B000H5V8D6,"I'm not sure what to say about this season that I didn't say about the previous four. I love this. The heroine is strong, but credible and well rounded. It mixes fun and humour with some pretty gritty aspects and some hard decisions. The ending is ... well, both sadly touching and satisfying. Thank goodness for a series that actually ends in a storytelling sense instead of having some network moneygrabber just dump it on a season ending cliffhanger.",1368489600,2,453,4.746835443037975

The casting just doesn't work as well and it stretches believability beyond the limits even for die hard science fiction fans.

This is the third or fourth time that I have watched this series all the way through (though I'm not sure how anyone couldn't watch all five seasons) and it's just as enjoyable as it was the first time I watched it. Jennifer Garner did an amazing job with the acting and doing a lot of her stunts. I don't know why she only got the one Emmy but she deserved more! This show is worth owning and I really enjoyed seeing a strong female lead who isn't depending on some man to come ""save"" her. The show got complicated when Jennifer Garner got pregnant so they had to tweak a few things, but it was nonetheless enjoyable! In typical J.J. Abrams fashion he's not going to end the show without leaving some questions unanswered and giving the audience some bittersweet moments, but it's one of my favorite shows all-time.",1366761600,,894,4.391566265060241

The series runs its course and while Season 5 brought in a cast of new characters (perhaps in a transitional move to keep the series alive beyond Season 5), it appears that the show had run its course and was cancelled or completed.

2628299,3,B000H5V8D6,"The fifth and final season of Alias solved most if not all of the questions fans have had from the dynamic very first episode of one of the most popular spy dramas on television. The writers had a difficult task in attempting to work around their leading lady's pregnancy, and the result is a surprisingly good final season, the finest episodes being those just before the powerful and shocking conclusion.

Weeks after the car accident that brought about the abduction and eventual murder of her fiance Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), agent Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is determined to bring down the organization that has left her child without a father. Pregnant with her first child and with more questions than answers, her investigation leads her to Prophet Five, a global terrorist organization determined to bring about the end times prophecies of a seventeenth century prophet and alchemist by the name of Milo Rambaldi. Recruiting the assistance of her formidable father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber), Vaughn's best friend Eric Weiss (Greg Grunberg), and tech wizard Marshell Flinkman (Kevin Weisman), Sydney begins to unravel the network of espionage surrounding the legends of Rambaldi as their enemies work against them to infiltrate APO.

As Sydney's half sister Nadia (Ma Maestro) lies unconscious in the hospital, her supervisor  Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) desperately seeks a cure for his daughter's illness. Reinstated to a position of authority within the Central Intelligence Agency after his presumed betrayal of the nation, he is left in the hands of blackmailers, who desire him to sabotage as many field operations as he can, in exchange for a cure. In the meantime, Sydney has located and recruited the intelligent and talented Rachel (Rachel Nichols) from an elite criminal organization very much like SD-6. As Sydney approaches the birth of her child, and mourns the loss of the man she loved, her relationship with her father strengthens, and unexpected faces reenter her life.

Unraveling the tangle of clues, double-identities, and plot twists that make up Alias on the whole, much less an explosive final season, is nearly impossible, as new faces are introduced and the audience says farewell to others. This could have been a horrific final season with the cast's limitations, particularly considering Garner's unexpected pregnancy, but the writers included it with flair and made it one of the high points of the ongoing story. It is very easy to find her scenes with the baby and particularly her dad adorable. Jack even cracks a smile or two, which is virtually unheard of in his grim view of the world. As if that's not enough, we also get a decent dose of Lena Olin as Sydney's evil mother, who can be supportive and sweet one moment, and bloodthirsty the next. There's also the appearance of show favorite Julian Sark (David Anders), a suave Brit who loves nothing more than to make money, and the presence of Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) in the 100th episode. But by far the best addition is Amy Acker as a delightfully evil villainess in high heels.

Most of the series has the normal amount of violence. There are numerous explosions and many losses of lives through terrorist acts and intentional bombings. Rachel is distraught having to enter the building where she lost most of her work associates. There are numerous scenes of various torture methods, the worst being someone's hand being shot at close range, and a man having his ear sliced off. Many people are shot and killed and/or wounded, including various main characters. A woman falls through a glass table, and the impact kills her; another falls from a great height. Hand to hand combat becomes vicious between adversaries. There is very little language (maybe a half dozen mild profanities altogether) and less sensuality than previous seasons.

Rachel does have a one night stand, not realizing that her chosen playmate is actually the enemy; various revealing costumes are worn, and more than once female agents approach and lure men into back rooms through the veiled promise of sex, only to knock them unconscious. There's also a supernatural aspect. Enemy agents place Sydney under a mild form of hypnosis in order to manipulate her mind and extract information from her. The CIA uses a similar tactic on a terrorist held in custody. Rambaldi's prophecies are gloom and doom, and some of them come true. A man is granted immortality through his loyalty to the cause. It is unclear whether visitations from a character who has passed on are a figment of his fractured mind or a ghost, but the implication is that it is his conscience giving illusions.

There is much to like about this dynamic conclusion to a show so many of us tuned in to for five years running, wondering what new twist would be thrown our way; but on a few fronts, the scripts do seem to falter. We are never given the answers to minor plotlines that kick off the season, nor is it clear just when certain knowledge is passed on to the characters, or allegiances are changed. I guess it is with Alias as it is in life... you can never know everything that has transpired, only what you are allowed to see.",1363824000,,5192,4.926857142857143

By Season 3 the episodes started to become insulting to the viewer's intelligence.

I was actually surprised to see that the final season was so much shorter, guess the sloppy work made me not pay attention to the episode count.
Who would've guessed that small role in the series actor Bradley Cooper is today the only ""star"" really doing much work now.

Fast, smart, great spy thriller.  And Jennifer Garner was amazing considering she was pregnant.

2628387,4,B000H5V8D6,"Great series.  Jennifer Garner was terrific in this role.  Season one was fantastic and as each season progressed, they weren't quite as good, however, as a whole great series.  She herself is worth the cost of the series.",1341446400,,222,4.7894736842105265
2628388,4,B000H5V8D6,"Between Jennifer Garner being pregnant coming in, Michael Vartan having a movie project through most of the season, and the fear that Garner could leave the show if it continued on it's obvious that the production crew had to mix things up a bit. They introduced a new female character to try to fill in and potentially one day replace Garner. They brought in a new male character for the new female character to identify with. They had to come up with a story as to where Vaughn was and what got him in that position to begin with and it was a lot for the season to overcome, especially since it was the last of Alias we would ever see. The season tries to be a bit more serialized than season four and it's not that the back stories of the new characters are bad, it's just that being introduced to new characters and having to set aside so much time for entry-level back stories so frequently made this feel a bit more like a spinoff series than the final season of a great show throughout the first half of the season.

The final two episodes (shown back to back on ABC on their original airing and as a result are linked together like a two-parter for me) are solid, not great to me but the arc leading up to them overall is very good stuff that starts to feel like Alias again. Garner had the baby and a break in the production schedule to get back into form, Vartan finished his project and came back to the show, and the show was for the most part very good again from that point on. I think if the concerns off the screen hadn't been present this season could have been very, very good but some factors just worked against the show in this final year. Much like season four I consider this season to be good television, just not great or epic like everyone thinks seasons one and two were and like I think season three was as well.",1340409600,,1840,4.257142857142857

Through pain and heartbreak Sydney and vaughn live happily ever after. But some do not make it out alive. This season is full of death and returns. We see the return of some pretty big villians from alias past my favorite being julian sark. It is sad when certain charecters die but it does make up for itself. There are some new recruits,and i like the way the were introduced into the show. They weren't forced but it's like they just fell into place. Sloane is better than ever ecspecialy from the episode ""30 seconds"" to the final minutes of the show and Arvin sloane got just what he deserved. And last but not least we see the Rambaldi prophecy we've been waiting five seasons to see play out and everything adds up,And we learn very quickly that Nadia is not the one that makes up the other half of the Rambaldi symbol. The end was sad but very well done,And in true alias fashion we get left with a cliffhanger,But not one that keeps you wanting more but one that makes you think the story has just begun. It all happens in the final moments of JJ Abrams best series ever!",1328227200,,1189,4.288888888888889
2628391,4,B000H5V8D6,"***This review may contain spoilers, if you have not seen through season 4 of Alias and do not wish to know of plot points up to that point I recommend that you stop reading now!***

ABC has been dealing with what many have referred to as the Mork and Mindy curse for a couple of decades. Since Mork and Mindy was cancelled within a year of being moved to Thursday nights, it appears that shows that are moved to, or premiere, on Thursday nights don't last a full year. Shows to suffer the fate are: Samantha Who, FlashForward, My So-Called Life, My Generation, and this year Charlie's Angels among many others. The curse appears to have also caused the end of Alias in its fifth season.

Feeling that Alias could have done better numbers if it didn't have to compete with American Idol and trying to strengthen their failing Thursday night line-up, ABC opted to move Alias to Thursdays at 8 PM for its fifth season in September of 2005. The move resulted in the lowest numbers in the show's history, so then ABC moved it to Wednesdays at 10 PM that December for two episodes. The show then took a four month break to allow Jennifer Garner to give birth before coming back in April of 2006 to the Wednesday, 8 PM slot. The juggling ultimately led to a series low average of 6.7 million viewers per episode and the show's cancellation.

Following the climactic car crash of season 4, as Michael Vaugn (Michael Vartan) was telling Sydney (Jennifer Garner) about the truth of who he was, Sydney escapes a secret organization known as Prophet Five, finds out that the CIA is investigating Vaugn for being a double agent, and that she is pregnant with Vaugn's child. Meanwhile, Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is in prison for working with Elena Derevko, but is offered help in getting out of prison and aiding his daughter Nadia (Mia Maestro) by Prophet Five in exchange for information on APO and Sydney.

Season 5 does a great job of fixing some of the issues of season 4. Where season 4 started off with quite a bit of bloat; season 5 jumps right into the issues that will plague the season from the beginning. For a truncated season with a few less episodes than the last four seasons, this season is filled with twists and action maybe even a little more than previous episodes. Of course the shorter length may also have helped keep the show more on track than the previous season where a truncated length may have helped keep things on track.

The one major problem with this season would have to be the fact that everyone seemed to know it was the last season. Vartan wasn't available for most of the season due to filming a movie, and Greg Grunberg moved on to Heroes. Jennifer Garner remained fully invested, but due to her pregnancy she was given something of a protg in Rachel Gibson (Rachel Nichols) who lacks the charisma of previous female stars of the series. Also added to the cast is Balthazar Getty as Thomas Grace to replace Vartan and Grunberg, and with the addition of the new characters comes some subplots that really could have been excised from the finished product.

With this last season though there is some joy to be had in the return appearance of characters who were major players in the first season or two but have been lacking in appearances since. Merrin Dungey returns for the finale in a flashback as we learn more of Sydney's past (a great choice of framing for the series finale that also sets up the brilliant epilogue), and Bradley Cooper gets to have a little fun reprising Will Tippin and going on a mission for the CIA. Although I do have to admit that I found his involvement a little troubling. One of the great things about Jason Segel's appearance in season 4 was that it illustrated the world outside the spy world, and Tippin had always been great in illustrating that previously. Here we see him pulling off an accent and fighting a woman that even Sydney has had trouble with it. It just felt that in the end the show kind of lost the line between the spy and non-spy worlds.

4/5

2628393,5,B000H5V8D6,"Alias Season 5 - I remember watching Alias every Wednesday night, all cozy in the living room with my wife Sally. We were dreading that this was the last season.  As the end of the final show came close to the 11:00 pm hour we watched.  The plot thickened and the good guys fought hard and prevailed.  The lovers met in an undisclosed location to raise a family and live happily ever after.  At the close of the show, to my surprise a Black Obelisk object was revealed by a child.  This child was the child of a new world.

The new world child would receive its power from a black object.  This was the same object shown in the photographs from Led Zeppelin Presence album.  When I saw it I ran downstairs yelling to Sally - ""That object is from the Led Zeppelin Presence album"".  I brought the album to her and she said ... ""Wow, it sure is"".  I asked my friends the next day, did you see Alias last night?

No one had seen the show but me.  Oh well!  Maybe no one else knew what I knew or saw what I saw but ya know what, I don't' care. I feel blessed.  God Bless America, Jennifer Garner and Led Zeppelin Presence - 1976.  Peace Out!  Mike Houston - Kingston TN",1322524800,,1164,4.129464285714286
2628394,5,B000H5V8D6,"I've read a lot of rumors regarding Alias' fifth and final season.  I've read that Michael Vartan was only present in a few episodes due his breakup with series star Jennifer Garner.  I've read that the season's episode order was cut from 22 to 17 because of Garner's pregnancy.  Whether those rumors are true or not, who can say?  Do Vartan's notable absence and the shortened episode order impact the series: yes and no.

I'll start with the yes.  From day one, Michael Vartan's character, Agent Michael Vaughn, has been instrumental in Sydney Bristow's life, initially as her CIA handler coordinating her double-agent status then as a romantic interest.  His absence gives the impression that the writers and producers were trying to fill a void with the addition of new characters.  If Alias had survived for a sixth season, this might not have been the case.  As for the shortened episode order ... some shows may be able to have just as much of an impact with just five of its season's episodes cut.  Alias is not one of those shows.  While the finale was satisfying and riveting, it was simply unable to address a lot of the unanswered questions from previous seasons.  You can tell they tried to wrap up as much as possible, but also knew that trying to cram in too much would have made it feel more fake.

Personally I feel a sixth season should have been produced.  Even if that meant airing it from January to May without interruption, the wait would have been worth it just to have a full final season that truly answered everything.

Despite what I've mentioned, the fifth and final season is still worth watching and have many standout episodes.  Of the new characters ... some worked, some did not.  Renee Rienne (Elodie Bouchez) worked well, as did the character of Tom Grace (played by Balthazar Getty).  Rachel Nichols as Rachel Gibson does not work; her character is interesting enough, but Nichols did not make me care much for the character.  Also, her chemistry with Balthazar Getty was not as strong as it should have been.  I love Amy Acker (""Fred,"" from the Joss Whedon series Angel) as terrorist Kelly Peyton and wish she had received more screen time.

In addition to Michael Vartan appearing in five of the season's seventeen episodes and having a cameo in another, Lena Olin returns as the deliciously insidious Irina Derevko for two full episodes and has a cameo in another.  Bradley Cooper (Will Tippin), Gina Torres (Anna Espinosa) and Merrin Dungey (Francie Calfo) each make an appearance as the series nears its home stretch.

I watched the first disc and honestly couldn't continue. I packed it away with the intent of watching when I had the free time and inclination to again.

It took me a few years, but I watched the full series again. I was charmed with the story, characters and plots from season one to season 4. While the seasons 3 and 4 were not as good as the first two, I still loved to watch them. Not true for season 5.
The final season is full of random new characters with flimsy backgrouds and annoyingly long scenes, off-kilter plots and painful plot holes. Also, two of the main characters were quickly and messily written out and two new characters written in. I found it hard to believe that the team that had brought me seasons 1,2,3 and 4 were also responsible for the painful filth that is season 5. I watched the season, but I fast-forwarded much of it so I could finish watching the Alias arc without having to suffer the pain of watching everything in detail.

2628435,5,B000H5V8D6,"The night Alias premiered on ABC, I could not get into it and gave up after about an hour.  I never watched it again.  After the series was cancelled, a friend recommended I pick it up on DVD and give it another chance.  I bought the first 2 seasons and I was hooked.  Last night I watched the final episode and thought that I would write about this great series in general.
Alias concerns Sydney Bristow, a very attractive young woman beautifully played by Jennifer Garner. When the series premiered, Sydney is working for SD-6, a ruthless counterintelligence organization that she is told is part of the CIA.  What she and most of the people working there don't know is that SD-6 is really a criminal organization, run by the despicable Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) that has nothing to do with the CIA.  Sydney eventually contacts the CIA and becomes a double-agent spying on SD-6 for the CIA.  Furthermore, her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) also is working undercover for the CIA while seemingly working for SD-6.  But thats just the beginning.
Over the next 5 seasons, the CIA would eventually attack and take out SD-6.  Sydney, her father and friends would really become agents for the CIA.  New regulars came and went.  Lena Olin showed up as Sydney's mother, a ruthless killer and ex-KGB agent.  In season 3, after being missing for months and suffering amnesia, Sydney returned to find her boyfriend and former CIA contact,Vaughn, married to a beautiful colleague and ruthless double-agent and killer.  In season 4 Sydney disovered she had a half-sister as a result of a daliance between her mother and Sloane.  Her sister, (the very hot Mia Maestro,) worked with Sydney for most of the season before winding up in a coma at the conclusion of a very wild ""Night of the Living Dead"" type episode where a far-out experiment turns the inhabitants of a Russian city into zombies.  This was a wild and exciting episode.  The 5th. and final season adds some new regulars (Rachel Nichols and the very cute Amy Acker who plays against type in a villainous role.)  The series comes to a very satisfactory conclusion.
This show had far-out scripts, terrific acting from Garner, Rifkin and Garber, and incredibly imaginative and exciting action scenes.  I've heard people say that it went off the rails after its 2nd. season.  I don't agree.  I found each season of the series to be exciting and enjoyable.  If you never watched it, do what I did.  Catch up with it on DVD and watch it at your leisure.  You'll be glad you did.",1276387200,,2527,4.70615034168565

2628481,4,B000H5V8D6,"This was the final season to one of the few action series helmed by a female character.

Season 5 introduces the new characters of Rachel Gibson (replacement for Sydney) and Thomas Grace (replacement for Vaughn).  The idea was to have the experience of how Sydney became an agent with Rachel's story.  In paper an excellent idea, in the works it was TERRIBLE.  The character was extremely weak, and unsympathetic.  The character of Grace was actually good but was not developed enough, and brought some intrigued to the show.

The supporting cast was wonderful as usual.  The interaction Sidney/Jack and Sydney/Sloane was always a welcome addition to the show.

I have to say that THE BEST ADDITION to this final season was the character of Payton (played by Amy Acker).  The best to describe her is a female Sark.  The whole season was worth watching and specially the episodes with her character.  Her popularity was so good that they made her a regular in the middle of the season.  GOOD JOB on that.

The season warps nicelly the Rambaldi theme, and the closure is well executed.  The final moments, we can think that it was left for possible movies, since we understand two things:  1. they are still spies  2. Isabel has the mind to be a spy.

I was a fan since season one and read all the books prior to the APO series, and was very sad to see the show go.

Its fate was probably sealed when it was briefly placed after LOST, another J. J. Abrams creation, and it failed to hold the audience.  So, by Season Five, ABC had pretty much given up on the show and fairly abused it, not promoting it sufficiently and then cutting the number of episodes during the long break necessitated by Jennifer Garner's time off to have her baby and recover.  Luckily, the producers were given sufficient time to create a compelling wrap up to the series.  Some story arcs ended up being truncated (especially Balthazar Getty's), but in the final moments one felt as a viewer that nothing major had been unresolved.

The first half of the season was, however, tremendously uneven.  Much of the problem was created by Michael Vartan's departure from the show.  With his ""death"" and Nadia's coma, combined with Jennifer Garner's decreased mobility due to her pregnancy, the show took on an entire new tone.  lodie Bouchez, Balthazar Getty, and the absolutely splendid Rachel Nichols were all brought on board as Sydney's new compatriots, while Amy Acker (best known as Fred/Illyria on ANGEL, and who will be returning to television on Joss Whedon's new series DOLLHOUSE) was the show's new bad gal.  Still, the show was always about Sydney Bristow, and with Jennifer Garner in the final months of her pregnancy and not able to get about with her former vigor, the show felt oddly stilted.  But as soon as the pregnancy was over and as Garner got progressively back into ass-kicking shape, both the plot and the action racheted back up.

I won't go into plot details because no review should spoil that for anyone.  Anyone who had followed the series from the beginning knew pretty much how it would end if the producers and writers were given their say.  The Rambaldi endgame would be revealed.  Sloane would somehow or other get his.  Things would be resolved between Sydney and her mother.  And one way or another Sydney would find peace in life.  With no real surprises (though with many twists), that is pretty much how the series ended.  While the first half of the season was one of the show's low points, the second half was ALIAS at its best and reminded we fans why we watched it all in the first place.

I loved the show's final episode.  If Season One of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER hadn't already used the title ""Prophecy Girl,"" it would have been a perfect title for one of the final two episodes.  Running underneath the show in its several seasons was the idea that Sydney Bristow was a chosen one (much like Buffy or, for that matter, Max Guevara on DARK ANGEL).  Her role in the culmination of Rambaldi's work had been foretold.  The final episode - co-written by Jeff Pinker and one of my favorite writers on TV, Drew Goddard (earlier a writer on BUFFY and ANGEL, later on LOST, more recently known as the writer of CLOVERFIELD, and appeared this summer in a cameo in Joss Whedon's brilliant DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG as Fake Thomas Jefferson) -- was wonderfully written, both moving forward the story that had been progressing in previous episodes and summing up the series as a whole.  The flashbacks to the young Sydney provided a sense of closure and also of fate to the series' end, as did the flash forward where we see Sydney's daughter Isabel display some the same abilities her mother possessed.  But it also ends with a sense that Isabel isn't fated to follow in the steps of her parents and grandparents.  After she quickly assembles the same geometric puzzle that her mother had as a young child, she bats it over before anyone sees what she has done, a gesture of rejection of that path and a hint that things will be different for her.

So, one of the best series of the past decade comes to a close.  My own reading of TV over that time is that Buffy had made TV irreparably safe for heroic female characters.  Xena and Dana Scully had anticipated what was about to happen with empowered females on TV, but without Buffy they would perhaps have been remembered as exceptions.  Buffy was the character that changed all the roles.  Xena was too much of a cartoon to make people accept females kicking butt as something not to be taken as exceptional.  But after Buffy it has been a commonplace.  But there had to be actual instances of heroic females as evidence that the rules had changed.  Aeryn Sun on FARSCAPE, Max on DARK ANGEL, and Sydney Bristow were the first -- and along with Veronica Mars and Starbuck from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still the best.  When someone writes the history of heroic women on TV, there will be a pre-Buffy section mentioning characters like the 1950s Annie Oakley, Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, Dana Scully, and Xena, then a section on Buffy, and finally the next wave.  Sydney Bristow should and will get her own chapter.  And what a great job Jennifer Garner did!  Though not trained in martial arts, she used her considerable athleticism (and early dance training -- indeed, dance seems to be a wonderful training ground for cinematic martial artists, further proof being the absolutely astonishing fight scenes by Summer Glau in SERENITY, showing that for a prima ballerina it is just choreography) to bring Sydney Bristow to life more believable than any other female hero.  In fact, to this day I've seen no TV female hero (and yes, I'm avoiding the word ""heroine"" intentionally -- ""heroines"" traditionally are anything but heroic) more physically convincing than Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow.  On top of this she brought acting chops that should have earned her a string of Emmys.  At least she got some nominations, unlike Lauren Graham, who astonishingly never got a single nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy when she should have won seven straight times.

So a wonderful end to a great series.  One reason I've just rewatched this series was in anticipation of J. J. Abrams's next major series, THE FRINGE.  Hopefully that one will follow in the footsteps of this great show.",1220745600,2,6235,4.7465181058495824

2628509,2,B000H5V8D6,"Let me start by saying I didn't watch Alias when it originally aired, so I had all DVD's and season's at my disposal.  I watched the first two seasons in about 2 weeks, they were so addicting.  But now with Season 5, I find myself daydreaming and looking at how much time is left in the show!  I'm on about episode 14, and there are only a couple left so I'll finish, just to see what happens.  But this season is definitely not nearly as good as the others.

I think the major reason for this is the cast changes.  I found myself saying, more than once, ""just kill that Rachel girl!"".  Not that I didn't like her, but I don't know her, and why would I can if her character lived or died?  I realize Jennifer had a baby, and that her and the guy who plays Vaughn (don't know his name) were dating and are broken up in these episodes; but to lose Vaughn, Weiss and Sark for most of the last season just didn't work.  For the record, Weiss and Sark became my favorite characters!  Even now, I honestly can't tell you the character name of the new agent guy...because I don't care about all these new characters; this is Alias, not some spin off!

Also, the way they brought Vaughn back was strange.  I'm sitting here wondering what the heck I just watched?  It all seems very forced and it just isn't as good somehow.  Yes, I'll see it to the end, but after being so addicted in the beginning, this was just quite a disappointing end.",1206662400,4,1432,4.236162361623617
2628510,5,B000H5V8D6,"This final season of Alias was as action packed as the others.  I am sorry to see this television show come to an end.  Although it was odd to introduce so many new characters at the close of a show, the writers kept true to Alias and its action.  I would recommend anyone see this final chapter in this great show.",1206316800,,315,4.131147540983607
2628511,4,B000H5V8D6,"The final season of Alias offered a sort of mixed bag to viewers. It wasn't the best season it wasn't the worst. Part of the problem is that the season ended soon after it got on track. The normal 22 episode season was shortened to 17 episodes to take into account Jennifer Garner's pregnancy.

The writing on the show has always been its high point and this season was no exception. A new global conspiracy was launced with Prophet Five and new characters entered as old ones departed. Some of the Sydney/Vaughn chemistry was lost as Michael Vartan went on hiatus from the show. The additions of agents Thomas Grace (Balthazar Getty) and Rachel Gibson(Rachel Nichols) were welcome if not exactly fleshed out. Amy Acker joined the case as villian Kelly Peyton and was perhaps the brightest light this season.

As always the show was a welcome diversion and this season like the others is fun escapism. The season is presented on four discs. The picture and sound quality are excellent. The extras feature four commentaries that are more fun than useful. There are features on the 100th episode, the mystery of Rambaldi, the music of the show and the usual blooper reel. Four easter eggs round out the collection.",1205193600,,1212,4.766666666666667
2628512,3,B000H5V8D6,"After five years, this production team and team of actors know how to do Alias. The pacing is good, there's lots of intrigue, exotic locales, amusing situations, saving the world, and all that. That said, a few things bothered me right from the start.

In the first episode, Michael Vaughan gets riddled with a hail of machine gun fire. If he'd been in a cartoon, he would drink a glass of water and it would immediately pour out through twenty holes fore and aft. But a few hours later, they've sewn him up, and he's discussing baby names with Syd, weakly. (And then, yes, he sips some water and thankfully does not leak.) The gunfire scene was cinematic, but it was overkill. A couple of good shots to the heart and liver would have sufficed, and made the latter scene more believable.

Then, [this is a bit of a spoiler, but hardly a major one] in the same episode our heroes are duped by an ex-CIA guy claiming to have the full authority of the US Government. Good grief! Marshall can tap into any computer worldwide, snag its data, and decrypt it on the fly. But these bozos are taken in by a non-CIA poseur? They can't check his bona fides? It doesn't wash.

So, along with all the good stuff in season five you get these little signs of carelessnes that put a damper on a person's enjoyment of the show. With a bit more care, these small problems could have been solved, and the series would have gone out with more credibility. Alias really faltered in Season Three, but it got back on its feet in Season Four. The producers didn't totally drop the ball in the last year, but it is a measured success.",1202515200,,1609,4.410774410774411
2628513,4,B000H5V8D6,"This once great show started slipping in the 3rd season with the introduction of the annoying Melissa George.  It slipped even more in the 4th season when the Vartan/Garner chemistry was so strained (in real life she had moved on to Ben Affleck).  This season is easily the worst (I loathed the new characters), though it rallies in the last 4 or 5 episodes and ends well.

That said, Alias is a fun show and worth a watch.  Garner is incredibly likeable and Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin are fabulous in every season.  There's still lots of fun to be had with wigs and ridiculous spy missions and huge fights and Alias good times.  Enjoy!",1201132800,,638,4.504347826086956

That said, the overall series was WONDERFUL.  Entertaining, engaging, and WAY out!  Unique storylines, fantastic locales (although mostly shot in L.A. - you sure couldn't tell!) it was five fun years!  Each week waiting to see what country Sidney will be in, what color will her hair be, what outrageous outfit will she be wearing, and how will Sloane drive her absolutely crazy while she goes on fantastic missions and Jack practices the most deadpan expression I've ever seen.

And like a previous reviewer, I was so sad at the loss of some characters, while never feeling I got a chance to know the new ones.

Brilliant show, I don't want to give anything away except to say everything that could happen does as always and it's well worth the surprisingly inexpensive cost!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could. You can even tell in the bloopers reel that they're all really cool funny people and had a ball filming it - Jennifer Garner has one of those laughs that makes you laugh no matter what!!!

Season 5  wraps the show up nicely and without giving too much away, it finishes on a high note.

There were new additons to the cast, one being  the casting of Amy Acker (who played the nerd-ish Fred in the TV series Angel) as a ruthless villian. She plays her part really well, and she's realy fun to watch.

the second was Rachel Nichols, who plays Rachel Gibson a young CIA agent in training, who Sydney takes under her wing.

I've never heard of her before but she's a really great actress and really easy on the eye too.

Thirdly we have Balthazar Getty who plays the tough guy CIA agent Thomas Grace, think Vaughn but more hardcore.

The series is great with some awesome group espionage moments, Sydney even uses her pregnancy as a ruse on a few occasions.

Season 5 is a mess from beginning to end. It's still Alias- there are still glimpses here and there of what the show used to be- but it's as if all imagination and life has been sucked out of it.

I don't know how much of it was due to Garner's pregnancy (the entire storyline of which is unbearable for multiple reasons which I won't go into here because of the spoilage factor). I don't know how much of the failure stemmed from the fact that, like some are speculating about Lost, Abrahms and company are great at starting stories but not so great at ending them. It never feels like there's a clear direction anywhere in this season. The plot twists, for lack of a better term, are cheap and manipulative in the extreme. One particular moment, about halfway-2/3rds through the season, sent me digging into the DVD case, convinced I'd missed at least an entire episode. Nope, I hadn't. I almost stopped watching then and there- it was one of the most egregious betrayals of a viewer's trust as you're likely to see.

The bottom line is, I wouldn't hate this season so much if I didn't love the show and care about the characters.

2628608,4,B000H5V8D6,"Things changed since season 4 and Fifth Season starts well, (first half)

- characters more human (esp. for Marshall and Jack)

- more credible scenario

- better production

- new fascinating characters

- more means

More time is dedicated to detail plot and situations, more means to impress the audience. And, at last, Alias 5 dared to get a major character disappearing. All of this making an enjoyable and more credible show.

(Marshall's lines about Sloane being good/bad, Swiss neutrality (...) are really funny!)

Then unfortunately (second half), season 5 drifts little by little onto something similar to season 4. The writer seemingly couldn't stand having a popular character off the scene, and gets him reappearing miraculously (probably due also to the ""100th episode"") hurting the credibility of the show.

Sloane's behaviour gets too incredibly moody. Some sudden events are just completely unjustified. Production gets cheaper (the walk in the snow on the mountain is loughable). And the ending is rather disappointing.",1167696000,,1037,5.351851851851852
2628609,3,B000H5V8D6,"If you are considering purchasing the 5th Season, you're probably just trying to complete your Alias collection, right? So if that's the case, please do, but if not, you may want to reconsider. Alias is one of my all time favorite T.V. series, and during the first two seasons, it was arguably the best show on television.  But, with season 5 we have to put it in context of the circumstances going on outside of the show: Jennifer Garner (Sydney) was dating Michael Vartan (Vaughan), and after breaking up, she married Ben Affleck-- and became pregnant with Affleck's child. This was devastating for Alias Season 5.  Firstly, because of this Vartan (Michael Vaughan) the crucial co-star left the show...some reports had it that Affleck didn't want him working with Jennifer- but who knows the real story, perhaps it was too difficult working with his ex-Jennifer while she was pregnant with another's child-- it wasn't as if he left the show to go do another project. Secondly, the action scenes for Sydney Bristow's character were severely limited due to Jennifer's fully pregnant figure, causing another crucial aspect of the show to vanish as well. Thirdly, Greg Grunberg, who plays Agent Weiss, left the show to pursue another opportunity and was written off, and Ken Olin, the primary Director for many of the classic Alias episodes directs only the first episode of Season 5, his last one-- most likely to kick the season off on a good note at least. Add to this mess the fact that creator of Alias and core spirit of the great first two seasons, J.J. Abrams, was preoccupied with his new projects Lost and MI:3, and you have the essential causes of what happened to Alias in Season 5, which is a complete unravelling of the great show.

As for season 5's shows themselves-- consider, also due to Vartan's and Grunberg's departure (Vaughan and Weiss), were the additions of characters Agent Rachael Gibson and Thomas Grace, who were brought in to fill the Character Void of Weiss and Vaughan, and to add a new romance aspect back into Alias replacing that of Weiss/Nadia, and Sydney/Vaughan.  The fan base was not very receptive to these new characters and the replacement is hollow, falling far short of the original cast and storyline that Alias fans had grown to love.  We do not feel for these characters at all, and instead of enjoying them, they're a constant reminder of the characters who aren't there.  To cap it off, Season 5 was cut short by 5 or 6 episodes by producers, the proof in the pudding, causing the orignal planned series ending and storyline to be significanlty altered for the worse. They were forced to try and tie things up too quickly, and what we the fans are left with, is an unsatisfying, poorly wrapped up swansong for the great series.  After the first two seasons, and good but not great seasons 3 and 4, this Season 5 debacle is not how Alias deserved to go out!

Now not looking at it so critically, there is enough of the true Alias in Season 5 to make it enjoyable for most viewers-- for all it's troubles it's still better than most shows, and I would even say so for the long time fans of the show as well, albeit just a shadow of its former self. For me who loved the show, it's just too big of a disappointment in a lot of ways (many mentioned above).  Alias was a great Spy World created by J.J. Abrams, that had me fully enraptured, and it could very easily have turned into one of Television's All Time Classics, with overpowering potential and calling to be spun into feature films. But Alias turned into a Has Been, and that is a shame.",1167436800,70,3589,4.621664050235479
2628610,4,B000H5V8D6,"Alias quickly became my favorite television show of all time after the sensational first season. Season 2 managed to some how be even better than the first. The next two seasons dropped in quality according to most fans. So now there is the final season. Despite the fact that Jennifer Garner is pregnant and more out of the picture than she has been in any season, I felt it did a good job of bringing back some of the excitement from the first two.

Having said that, I would not even put it in the same league as the first. Michael Vartan, a staple to this great show, is not in almost 90 percent of the season, Jennifer as I said takes a seat as the center of attention for at least the first half of season 5, and we get a new agent(s) who comes into the picture.

Rachel Nichols plays Rachel Gibson, an agent who like Sydney from season 1, believed she was working for the CIA. Once she found the truth out, she joins Sydney and the team to work in APO. Her story line gives us a different angle to Syd's when she worked for SD-6 in S1, because unlike Sydney, Rachel was not field trained. She was also much more timid and her vulnerability was very great to watch. You see her grow as a person and become stronger and more confident.

Another new edition is Balthazar Getty, who plays Thomas Grace. He is recruited to fill in for Vaughn. He brought a different style to the team and was a loner for most of the season. The first half of S5 belonged to Rachel Nichols, and if you can get used to Sydney not being front and center, you'll enjoy it.

Once Jennifer had the baby and was able to commit more into the show, is when the season shows glimpses of seasons past greatness. Every episode from halfway on begins to uncover every secret that remained unanswered throughout the show. Since the episode count was cut from a full season to just 17 eps, I felt at times the story seemed a little rushed. Every thing wrapped up but I felt it could have been dragged a little longer to give it more of an affect.

The dvd packaging was a little disappointing. The set did not include a booklet that describes each episode like past seasons. Other than that its fine, but I'm a person who enjoys every aspect of a dvd set, and its too bad that wasn't included.

This is a wonderful season that wraps up this great show perfectly. Some new faces may cause people to judge this season a little too hard, but they fit in great, and Jennifer comes back with full force in no time and makes the show even stronger.",1167177600,4,2512,4.277894736842105
2628611,2,B000H5V8D6,"First off, I guess I should address what a few others have already mentioned -- yes the box is incredibly ugly.  When I first saw it a couple of months ago, I thought it was just a promotional poster.  But no, sure enough, they used this awful design for the box.  I can't complain about the smaller size because at least the height's the same as seasons 3 and 4, and there is only 4 discs in this collection as opposed to the typical 6.

Now to my original observation, it just doesn't work.  I found myself watching the first half of this season thinking, ""Why did they do this to this show?""  Anyone who's watched ALIAS up to this point knows that the first two seasons were absolutely fantastic, season 3 was a disaster, and season 4 was all but pointless.  More of the same from season 4 here.  New characters introduced who have an interest factor of zero.  I enjoy Balthazar Getty as an actor, but by episode 6, I realized I still had no idea what his character's name was.  Perhaps worst of all, the Irina Derevko plot line was down right insulting to any faithful follower of the show down the years.  How do you just change a character's persona like that when you were clearly shooting for the exact opposite in previous seasons?  Sometimes ""shock value"" has a price.

There are many other dynamics I'd discuss but I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the fifth season.  Some may like it, and it does semi-redeem itself post-episode 100.  But to me, all in all, seasons 3 through 5 never lived up to the first two installments and that's a shame because those two years were TV at its finest.  Too bad J.J. Abrams moved on to LOST and MI: 3.  He had some magic with this show.",1166572800,13,1709,4.3575949367088604
2628612,1,B000H5V8D6,"There is absoluting nothing redeeming about this season. It has become a pale shadow of the great, great first and second seasons, and collapses into unintentional selfparody.

This is partially due to circumstances: Michael Vartan leaving/not leaving the show makes a mockery of the emotional throughline, Jennifer Garner's pregnancy means that she is no longer available as action heroine for a part of the season. Unfortunately the characters brought in to 'replace' her (partially) are dull and shallow (with the exception of Elodie Bouchez) and we never get the opportunity to become emotionally attached to them.

The new evil organization Prophet 5 falters towards the end, the Sloane saga becomes completely ridiculous, and Irina Derevko is back - but they'd better kept her out of the series, because her actions make no sense and cheapen a fascinating character.

Add to this not a single memorable action scene, clumsy plotting, bad special effects, idiotic behavior by the lead characters (time and time again), an unsatisfactory ending to the Rambaldi legend, and you are left with a barely watchable mess. Small wonder ABC didn't want to sign off for an entire 22 episode run. Alias started out on an all-time high, and gradually started a downward slide which turned into an avalanche. And all because the strength of the original concept was lost along the way: an everyday girl-next-door is actually Jane Bond. The mixture of (good) soap and outlandish spy capers, with the promise of an huge epic story unfolding in the background (the mystery of Rambaldi and the shadowy organization(s) chasing down his legacy) made Alias special. By almost completely jettisoning the 'real' part of the series (Syd's daily life and non-spy oriented concerns), it lost its true spark of genius.

Extras on this set are sparse (four commentaries and about an hour of uninteresting featurettes). Most of the more indepth extras about the season are to be found on the extra disk in the limited edition set.",1166227200,18,2007,5.109756097560975
2628613,2,B000H5V8D6,"""Alias"" is one of my favorite shows - even in its weakest it was excellent compared to nearly every other show on broadcast television. The fifth season, while reinventing the show again, is highly entertaining, exciting, and thrilling, and I recommend that anyone watch it.

However, I have serious, serious problems with this DVD release. I do not actually own it, because I bought the far superior Rambaldi box complete collection (all five Alias seasons in one). But I have seen the season five release and it's terrible. Out of all five DVD releases, it is the ugliest box. The promo picture is horrible, the green cover doesn't go well at all with the other seasons, and the big words ""FINAL SEASON"" is simply tacky. The box is nowehere in size to the other releases either, it's what feels like less than half an inch thick. This has been a major problem for me as well, with Alias - Buena Vista changes the packaging for each season. It's very annoying.

Also, the special features are nothing. A few interesting features, but overall the supplements are very weak for the final season. The entire thing feels rushed and botched, like no one CARED that this was the last season of such a beloved series.

If you can afford it, I highly urge you to invest in the complete collection. It's very well done and put together (although it DOES have it's flaws) and has a bonus disc of extras that are very informative and fun to watch. However, only 40,000 are being made so supplies are limited.",1165622400,4,1498,4.62406015037594
2628614,3,B000H5V8D6,"...then this is worth watching, given the good stuff mentioned in the other reviews.  Some of the best and most creative parts of the season were homages to the Buffy/Angel-verse (I finally noticed Drew Goddard and Jefferey Bell in the credits - check out Nocturne of Season 4 if you have doubts) - and, for me, this saved the season!  Even though there were good things (especially our much beloved actors), it seemed like the writers just gave up on the ending, sacrificing character for plot.  I LOVED Alias - so I WAS expecting to be blown away.  What follows were my major disappointments (warning: ***SPOILERS follow***):

1.  Irina.  As a long-time fan of the show, I believed in Sydney's choices.  Sydney repeatedly chooses to let her evil mom roam free, trusting that Irina has an ""endgame"" that justifies death and destruction (""truth takes time"").  Lena Olin does a terrific job of portraying Irina's complexity.  Because Sydney and Jack fundamentally trust Irina (at least, when Jack isn't murdering her), the audience either also trusts her or feels like the main characters are dupes on a weekly basis.  Fans wondered: is she trying to save Sydney, or is this an epic, slow-burn of a betrayal?  Either would have been satisfying.  However, it turns out that Sydney's mom was just...crazy?  If you were like me, you were left feeling like: ""huh?""

2.  Vaughn's ""fake-out"" death.  Nobody who watches Alias could believe that Sydney and Jack wouldn't have mourned Vaughn's death and executed some serious payback on his killers...unless he wasn't actually dead.  Unfortunately, the writers set up this whole idea that people who were offically ""dead"" were in this evil top-secret society.  One couldn't help but wonder if Vaughn's plan was to fake his death to ""earn"" his way into this secret organization and find out what his father knew.  But, sigh, no, he was just ""healing.""  Sending him away to heal admitted some major weaknesses in the ability of our main characters to protect each other.

3.  Rambaldi.  Uh, so...WHY did Irina want to bring about ultimate destruction?  Was the prophecy even really fulfilled?  Why would the bad guys risk Ana Espinoza/Sydney's double on a clearly unimportant mission to trick Vaughn?  WHY would Sydney go through with the prophecy after five years of Rambaldi-related-eye-rolling...without a plan?

4.  Sydney's transition from Superspy to Spymom.  Sydney sits in the car and gets stuck behind a train while Vaughn is shot, stands around to let Sloane shoot her father, and dithers blankly while letting her mother crash through the window on the roof - she's losing her touch!  Instead of whining about the restrictions of her pregnancy, why doesn't she focus on teaching the newbies how to be the next gen superspies?  She just accepts Rachel's limitations and doesn't actually impart new wisdom.  My feeling is that the passing on of the torch needs to offer new insight in order to avoid the jumping of the shark.

In spite of these disappointments, this is a fine season if you're not expecting to be blown away.  It seemed like they were merely aiming to finish the series adequately to tie up some loose ends.  If the choice was this effort or not finishing it up at all, thanks, guys, for seeing it through!",1165104000,6,3270,4.903284671532846
2628625,4,B000H5V8D6,"While overall I did not like the first seasons that much, the series has improved quite a bit, especially during season 4 but here the quality is still high.

2628626,3,B000H5V8D6,"I had to buy this to have all of the Alias seasons, but if Buena Vista thinks I'll buy any of their other dvds for a long to come, and perhaps forever, they have another thing coming.  A front pocket with no booklet, no info--just a one-page flyer ad for the Rambaldi cube set--ep titles printed on one of the fold out pages only.  5 episodes per disc instead of 4 like past seasons--the video quality doesn't match up with past seasons.  Half of the extras that we are used to on Alias sets, and no deleted scenes--all that was reserved for the extra disc in the complete set.  My understanding is these crappy ""5 eps per disc"" are also in the big set, too, that they expect you to shell out money for!  I buy four seasons on dvd of this show--so naturally the big set is useless to me--and what do they give me for the final season?  A skinny little set (seasons 1 to 4 just dwarf it) with horrible colors, boring disc artwork (Jen in four similar poses), no printed info, few extra features, and crappy video quality.  Thanks a lot for sending this series out with a whimper, dvd-wise.",1164326400,12,1088,4.303921568627451

Despite being inconsistent in its third and fourth years, Season Five really picks up the rev again and drives this show to a great finale.

Sure if they had had a few more episodes and some more money to finish things off it would have really hit the spot, but as it stands, Alias is one of the few shows to provide a satisfying finale to an amazing legacy.

Easily the best show i've ever seen, I will miss you Alias :(",1164240000,4,473,4.175824175824176
2628628,3,B000H5V8D6,"Season 5 of super spy hit Alias picks up moments after season 4 ended.  Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) and Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) were just in a car crash.  They are quickly whisked away and hidden but eventually Michael can explain his comment to Sydney.  The revelation about his name leads Sydney and the rest of CIA black ops unit APO to Prophet Five, yet another secret organization trying to rule and world and solve the Rimbaldi riddle.  Just as Sydney is getting the good news that she is pregnant, tragedy strikes.  Now Sydney will stop and nothing to take down Prophet Five and get her revenge.

I have been a loyal Alias fan since day one, but I felt this season was the weakest of the series.  We've already fought against multiple secret organizations, so that plot felt old to me.  The biggest problems, however, were the actors who left.  We lost three of season 4's main characters.  The producers brought in potentially interesting new characters to replace them, but with only 17 episodes, they didn't get the time to develop they needed.

Not to say the season is a complete loss.  The storylines are still interesting.  The decision that this would be the final season came early enough that the major storylines from the series could be resolved.  And lots of old friends and enemies come back for a final appearance.  I thought this was an especially nice touch as the show wound down.  The acting, as always, is top notch, not only from the returning actors but also from the newbies.

Ultimately, I just couldn't get over the loss of characters I already knew and loved to fully enjoy this season.",1164067200,8,1632,4.690140845070423
2628629,5,B000H5V8D6,"Judging from the prior seasons, and from having seen the final epiode, I'm quite certain this season will be up to any/all expectations (I'll eventually add more once I've watched all the episodes).

The show has always had top-notch production values and been highly reminiscent of La Femme Nikita. In the spy-thriller genre, Alias is second only to its LFN progenitor, but a step above (in my opinion) 24 in terms of overall story arc.

The DVD releases have always been impressive: good video quality, good audio quality (granted I'm not a sound/video snob, and I don't have a 30"" plasma TV yet). The discs always have sufficient bonus materials from deleted scenes to commentary tracks, and blooper reels. I expect this release will be no different.

I will note however that they have changed the packaging format (just like LFN did on their fifth/final season; speaking of which is it coincidence that both series ended on a shortened fifth season and made large attempts to tie up all the ""loose ends"" of the series?). However, I'm not as thrilled with the changes to Alias' packaging as I was with the changes to LFN. Whereas LFN change from an attractive book format to a more standard double-thin pack format, Alias appears to have changed to a double-stacked fold-out configuration, that I frankly dislike in no uncertain terms. IE, to get to disc 2, you have to take out disc 1 then take out disc 2 then put disc 1 back into the fold-out case. I really wish that studios would stop doing that to customers (I vaguely recall they did that with one or two of the last Highlander seasons too, much to the dismay of fans). I'd have preferred that they simply used two double-disc thin packs like LFN did. I much prefer those to double-stacked fold-outs.

That aside, the rest of the packaging is pretty standard, down to the outer plastic slip case with the special fetures printed on the back, and Jennifer Garner printed on the front. Though for those who tend to throw out the outer plastic, it would be NICE, if they'd print the special features on the back of the fold-out packaging rather than the outer plastic. C'est la vie.

I look forward to catchign the last season in DVD re-run. I'm sure it will be spectacular, one way or the other. And I know the ending is appropriate.",1164067200,6,2292,4.649382716049383
2628630,4,B000H5V8D6,"Alias was definitely running out of steam heading into Season 5 and the episodes before the break seemed to indicate the last season would be a disaster - especially with JJ Abrams and Jennifer Garner seemingly moving beyond this project.  However, after the break there was definitely more energy, the scripts were tighter and Season 5 was saved with a slam-bang final episodes.

Without giving away too much, many loose ends were tied up/together:  We find out about Irina's ""death"", Sloane gets some ""alone"" time, and we get to see Sydney and Vaughn reunited...

All around good fun and worth the time, especially the 2nd half of the season.",1163808000,3,644,4.8807339449541285

I mean come on... (SPOILERS) Vaughn gets shot in the chest multiple times, we find out his name isn't Vaughn and he isn't dead, he wakes up to Sydney and their baby? I just don't know. That and I was so sick of the whole Irina is she good or evil and Sloane is he good or evil storylines. And enough of Rambaldi! So old.

The finale was alright, but this season didn't do ALIAS justice.",1161907200,10,561,4.194444444444445
2628632,2,B000H5V8D6,"I hated how this season ended.  Everything seemed very calculated and rushed in order to end the show, and I came out with more questions than when I first started watching Alias.  There are way too many lose ends and that they didn't even attempt to explain, like at the very beginning of the season why would Vaughn refer to himself as a ""bad guy"" and hide his investigation from Sydney, and why is there a prophet five? Prophet five seems like the already used and abused Alliance.

I also really expected more from the whole Rambaldi prophecy, like actually finding out who Rambaldi is (like the glimpse we get of him from the first season) and his connection to the ""Bristow"" women.  I mean I always knew it would end with some connection to ""living for ever"", but come on they needed more than Sloane turning ""evil"" again and accidentally killing his daughter.

And with Irina I always saw her as ""nothing is ever black nor white"" and ""truth takes time"", she just seemed way more complex a character than to die so feebly and so disillusioned with Rambaldi.

And then what's the reason behind killing all of Sydney's family?  I mean hasn't she suffered enough throughout the entire show only to lose all of those she has fought so hard to keep safe?!

When it ended I just sat there with this looming cloud of disappointment, knowing that from the beginning of the season I had just been setting myself up for it.

On a happier note I love both seasons 1 & 2 (I feel like they tried to dumb it down after 2), and own all of the seasons.  This show has been my favorite, for its flawless acting, intensity, complex relationships and storylines.  What a way to go....",1160611200,15,1671,4.481848184818482
2628633,5,B000H5V8D6,"As an addicted Alias fan, I can say that I have watched every episode of all five seasons (some numerous times), and I do not find some of the incongruities in season five that others have commented on.  For example, how can any of us forget Sydney's tirade to Vaughan in the beginning of season 3, when she tells him that if he had been the one that had ""died"", she would have waited and believed?  From that moment on, anything that happened to Vaughan (such as his supposed death in season 5)or Sydney could not be considered out of reach for this show.  I mourned for Sydney's loss of Vaughan like anyone else, but I was not disappointed for the way it was handled.  Michael Vartan could not be replaced in this show any more than John Ritter could be replaced in ""Eight Rules"".  Yes, I found that Rachel Nichols and Balthazar Getty added little to the show, but that wasn't their fault.  They were treading in shoes that could not be filled by other characters.  I LOVED the SPYGRANDPA Jack moments, such as when watching his baby granddaughter (and in his usual deadpan)saying ""Apparently I'm funny"". David Anders ""Sark"" was underused in season 5 but was fabulous when he was used.  He showed a glimmer of humanity after his tryst with a certain agent. Loved that! Through all the twists and turns, Alias always stayed true to the family dynamics, (skewed as they were in this show).  If the show had revealed Irina or Sloane different than the way they ended up, those would have been incongruous plot twists. I absolutely recommend season 5, all seasons of Alias are by far the best of the best shows on television.  You must watch them all, in order preferably!  Thanks to all of you involved in Alias for providing great, high quality entertainment!",1160524800,32,1759,4.587859424920127

The character mix was superb, the storytelling was brilliant and eclectic, and the action was unbeatable.  It was hard to believe sometimes I was watching a TV Show.  I can't watch a James Bond film without thinking how pathetic it is compared with Alias.  James Bond is a pansy compared to Jack Bristow.  Hopefully they will come to their senses and at least go for a feature film.  JJ Abrams is a brilliant writer and director and I can't wait to see what's next.  Hopefully, he will always have his foot in TV.  Alias is like a 130 hour feature movie, and that's how I like it!",1159920000,8,677,4.186046511627907
2628635,2,B000H5V8D6,"There is one truly outstanding episode in Alias's fifth season.  Midway through the year, Lena Olin's astonishing, duplicitous Irina shows up waiting in Sydney's kitchen, and the episode that follows, ""Maternal Instinct,"" should be remembered as one of the series best.  What the episode reminds you of is all of those qualities that ever got you interested in Alias - a family triangle of characters with moral ambiguities, shifting alliances, love that exists despite selfish motives, and a whole host of unresolved anger and support (not the least of this credit goes to the top notch performances by Olin, Jennifer Garner, and Victor Garber).

What the episode also reminds you of is just what Alias lost in its fifth season.  After a couple of episodes that hinted at a potential of a more daring Alias to come (Vaughn dead!  Elodie Bouchez's sexy Reny Rienne driving through a building on her motorcycle!  Sloan evil again!), the show fell apart.  The Prophet 5 plot that supposedly was driving the season was a convoluted mess, a haphazard maguffin that even the characters have very little patience for.  It gets rushed like so much else in the false, forced season.  Were we supposed to feel sympathy for Rachel Nichols' dull and naive Rachel?  Feel drawn to the ""mystery"" surrounding Balthazar Getty's monstrously dull Tom (the conclusion of his storyline invovling - oh no! - a break-in to a car impound lot is a series low)?  Feel excited by the sloppy revolving door of ""actual"" villains (wait, it wasn't Gordon Dean after all!)?  Not notice that Bouchez shows up only to be forgotten about then suddenly killed off?  It's all indicative of a lack of focus that makes the show's action this season ridiculous and the soapy moments laughable - few shows this side of NBC's daytime lineup would attempt an episode like ""30 Seconds,"" where Nadia's death on a glass table couldn't possibly cause more eye-rolling.

There is some credit to be had over the year - Amy Acker's turn as well-coiffed villain Peyton is the sort of sexy nemesis that made Alias's brand of girls-only antagonism so exciting over the years - but even the season's high points get brushed aside in the rush to ""fulfill"" the Rimbaldi plot machinations of years past.  There's a valiant attempt to include as much as possible, but even the most casual fans will find continuity problems in the short and long term stories (How exactly is Vaughn alive again?  Didn't we see him buried?).  In the end, the finale ""All The Time In The World"" comes down to one good twist (the final be-careful-what-you-wish-for fate of Sloan) surrounded by a pile of irrelevant look-who-we-got-to-come-back! flashbacks, a quick and anticlimactic end to the Rimbaldi myth that mobilized the series, and an endless cat and mouse game that seems less like coherent television and more like the world's longest game of Where In The World Is Carmen San Diego.",1157846400,21,2914,4.902240325865581

2628638,4,B000H5V8D6,"Warning: This review contains references to very specific plot points during the season.  These could be considered spoilers to those of you who've not yet watched this season and wish to remain unaware of what happens.

Alias has been my favorite show since it started in 2001, and up until its very last moment, I would have cancelled any meeting or skipped any class to make sure I got to watch.  Its fun marriage of spy thriller action and serialized family drama (plus the unique addition of Rambaldi, the mysterious 15th Century prophet whose works play a key role in characters lives) was a perfect combination, and the show got so many things really right.  And, as illustrated during this season, a few things really wrong.

In retrospect, Alias lost sight of The Bigger Picture after season two, but it continued to entertain and move forward, always leaving some hope that answers were on the way and mysteries would be solved.  As long as the show had a future, I remained annoyingly optimistic that the writers would find a satisfying way to tie everything together: The Rambaldi mystery, Irina's role, the missing two years and fulfillment of The Prophecy, etcetera.  With season 5, the time had come for the show to make good on its promising potential...or not.

Season 5, the final season, is by far the weakest of the show's run.  The first handful of episodes all struggle to illustrate even mediocre stories and ideas.  Perhaps this is because the writers, even knowing this to be their final year, unwisely decided to introduce three new main characters in order to divert attention away from Garner's real-life pregnancy (read: Garner/Sydney's inability to don sexy outfits and jump off the roofs of 30-story buildings).  The most offensive of these additions is the character of Rachel Gibson, played by the banal and boring Rachel Nichols.  Her character was meant to be a parallel of Sydney, a smart and capable spywoman who finds her entire spyworld is backwards, wrong, and evil.  Instead of honoring the image of Sydney, however, Rachel only reminds viewers that there is only one Sydney Bristow and only one actress to play her.

The list of wrongs committed extends from there.  The new characters constantly distract from the original premise and character dynamics of the show.  At one point, the writers actually attempt to take Sydney out of the center of the plot and put Rachel in her place (skanky dress and all).  For the best illustration of this, see episode ""Solo.""  Balthazar Getty's character matches the blandness of Rachel's, and he adds no intrigue or interest to any of the stories in which he is involved.  This becomes painfully clear during the last half of the season as we are introduced to an ""Agent Grace (Getty) has a dark secret and mysterious past"" plot that eats up massive amounts of valuable time.  The only addition that merits any praise whatsoever is Elodie Boucher as Renee Riene, a beautiful and attitudinal outlaw, and who it is revealed was a longtime friend and collaborator of ""Michael Vaughn."" Of course, Boucher's character is severely underused, leaving viewers to wonder what the point of having her around was.  Had they written more for her and ignored the Blonde Boob (Rachel), things would have been much better.

In addition to throwing useless characters into an already complicated (some might say ""convoluted"") story, the writers commit sins across the board.  Among the chief offenses:

1. Killing off ""Michael Vaughn"" just to bring him back (through flashback/fantasy and through ""Gotcha!  We fooled ya!  He wasn't really dead!""-type storylines) due to fan demand and the realization that Sydney needs her soul mate.

2. The writers come up with the astoundingly exciting and well-fitting idea of using Project Helix to clone Sydney (with ANNA ESPINOZA as the procedure's (un)lucky volunteer!!!) in order to fulfill the Prophecy.  However, they obliterate the arc before it even has the chance to play out.  Such a disappointing climax on so many levels: No Prophecy fulfillment, no battle between Syd and EvilSyd (as foreshadowed in Season 3), and no battle period...Just a few easy bullets to kill the best story idea the show had all year).

3. Though it was clear they were trying, the Rambaldi resolution was less a resolution and more of an unclear, bogged-down headscratcher.

4. We were fortunate enough to see Lena Olin (Irina) pop up throughout the season, and while all of her scenes were incredible, I find that the writers' ultimate handling of her character (read: demonizing of) was tasteless and illogical.

5.  Ignoring Nadia (could she not have stepped in to fill the role of ""sexy spy"" in place of newcomer Rachel?).  Bringing her back just long enough to kill her (a highly offensive end to an unfortunately underused character).

6. 17 episodes.  You'd think since I'm here writing about the diminished quality of the show I'd be glad the season was shortened.  However, the smaller batch of episodes is, in my opinion, a huge detriment to what could have been a better season.  With 5 less hours to explain and tie everything up, viewers can definitely feel the rushed quality of the story arcs. The pacing of the season is ruined, with a strong (mostly) second-half attempting to balance out a slow, uninspired first-half.

So, you may wonder, then why the high rating?  Well, simply because I couldn't bring myself to rate it less.  Though there are some plot holes to leap over, some characters to ignore, and some resolution left wanting, this is still an integral part of the series.  And it is not without its strengths.  In the last hour of the show the writers get several things right with respect to Sloane.  Sydney revenges the deaths of Danny and Francie as she fires her gun empty into a maniacal Sloane.  Though his death is short-lived, his ultimate fate is even more appropriate.  I get chills when I think of GhostNadia walking out to leave him alone for eternity.  The previously mentioned storyline of EvilSyd was pure genius while it lasted.  The show's big Episode 100 (the brilliantly titled ""There's Only One Sydney Bristow"") was among the best they have produced, with great returning favorites (Will and Anna Espinoza) and a humorous, action-packed story.

At its worst, Alias is a confused but still entertaining show with good intentions.  At its best, Alias is thrilling, shocking, moving and innovative.  Season 5 illustrates both sets of qualities, and gives a decent, though not totally satisfying, closing to a show that I will sorely miss every Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday night, at 9, 8, and sometimes 10 p.m., respectively.  I wonder where we'd be if ABC had treated it even slightly better...",1155859200,28,6737,4.932564330079858

It had everything that us fans have come to love; Action, drama, mystery, doulbe-crosses, shocking reveals, and everything else that makes Alias great.

Jennifer Garner is untouchable in the lead. Sydney discovers early on that she is pregnant, and when Vaughn is murdered, she sets out on a mission to protect not only her unborn child, but also herself. Not only that, but she must now uncover the truth surrounding Vaughn's past, and those responsable for his demise.

Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin are also brilliant as Sydney's father and sworn enemy. Sloane, once again, grabs our sympathy early on, and we want nothing more than for him to cure his daughter. Lena Olin reappears as Irina Derevko, and is more fabulous than ever. New cast additions include Elodie Bouchez as a mysterious fugitive from Vaughn's past, Balthzar Getty as new recruit Tom Grace, who is also harbouring a dark secret. Finally, Rachel Nichols joins the cast as a rookie agent who must be trained by Sydney, after working for the men behind Vaughn's murder.

2628641,4,B000H5V8D6,"Alias offered Jennifer Garner in a bunch of sexy different outfits, many twists, great characters and great action. So when I heard it was the last season I was pretty disapointed. It at least isn't a bad last season. I always pictured the Quentin Tarantino character coming back though for one last battle with Sydney. Since his appearance in season one was one of the best. Then he made another appearance in Season 3. So I always pictured Sydney having to get rid of him too. The last season does still go out with a bang though.

  You have Vaughn getting killed off in the first episode of the season. Which I thought sucked since he was always one of my favorite characters and when he was gone the show felt like it was missing a big chunk of what made it good. Although he's missing throughout the season, you know there's probably a good chance they may have just faked his death to protect him from bad guys. Still though the season could've more of him. Maybe Michael Vartan didn't want to be around doing scenes with his former g/f while she was pregnant. I mean he does just happen to come back after Garner gave birth to her baby...

  While Sydney's hot sister Nadia is in a coma through the season with Sloane trying to figure out how to get her out of it. The show offers new characters in Vaughn and Nadia's absense. The hot Rachel Nichols plays Rachel Gibson who just like Sydney was fooled into believing she was working for the C.I.A.. When infact she was working for bad guys of course. With Garner pregnant, she takes over wearing the sexy outfits through half the season. She even gets some action. Balthazar Getty (was in one season of Charmed) plays Thomas Grace who starts working for Sydney's crew. He has a hidden agender of his own and Gibson wants to figure out what it is. lodie Bouchez almost steals the show as Rene Rienne who becomes a strong allie to Sydney. She isn't used as much as she could've been though.

  While Amy Acker (Angel) is excellent as a juicy new villian that Rachel Gibson used to work with. I'm glad that they chose to keep her around right up to the series finale because she's really good. While Gina Torres is back as Sydney's most dangerous enemy Anna Espinosa. Torres is such an under-rated actress that I'd even love to see play Storm if Halle Berry doesn't come back for an X-4. I'm sure she'd ask for less money and not expect the whole script surrounded around her too! Anyway her battles with Sydney are always fun and every time she made an appearance in the show you knew you were in for something good.

  Plus it's good to see that the awesome David Anders comes back for some final appearances as Julian Sark. He was always to this show what Spike was to Buffy. He was a bad guy but it was always hard not to love the guy and not want to see him get killed. Lena Olin is back as Sydney's mother and of course once again she has to figure out if she can trust her. While finally learning to trust Sloane might come back to haunt Sydney as well.

  Although Vaughn isn't around most of the season they do manage to tell some good stories and still have some great action and suspense. They don't do a bad job trying to tie in all the loose ends by the last episode. For instance we do get to see why Wambaldi ""or however you spell it"" is so important to Sloane. It's sad seeing the show go but you can't say that it's last moments were really bad tv.",1155340800,4,3420,4.330203442879499
2628642,5,B000H5V8D6,"This show really caught me off guard.  When I had first heard about the premise of the show, I did not at all think that I would be into it.  How wrong I was.  In thinking about summing up how I felt about the show, I was reminded of a saying I heard once about the nature of genius.

It was uttered by the interview subject of a documentary I saw about the life and work of one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century, the little-known Alan Touring, the father of modern computing.  In describing Touring's contributions to modern scientific thinking, the man made the following assessment:  Whenever someone comes up with something smart or clever, a little part inside all of us thinks ""Wow, why couldn't I think of that?"".  When a work of genius appears, one begrudgingly has to admit that, not in a million years, was there any way I could have thought of that.

That is what this television show represents for me.  Total and complete genius, start to finish.  None of us saw it coming, and once it did, resistence was futile.  The way I came to know the show was almost towards the end of its television run when I was given the boxed-set of the first season by a friend of mine as a present.  Suffice it to say, I was hooked.  I immediately went out and bought seasons 2, 3, and 4 and have gone on to enjoy every one of them.  I know everybody says seasons 1 and 2 were better than 3 and 4, but for me, season 3 was just some of the most perfect television I had ever seen, with season 4 seeing a bit of a dropoff in terms of quality.

I have not yet seen season 5, but am eagerly (Read:  Can't [expletive] wait!!!) looking forward to seeing it.  I will not discuss any of the plot points from the first 4 seasons here, because I believe that Alias is something that needs to be experienced without any foreknowledge of what is going to happen.  Like all great art.

The best that die-hard fans of the show can hope for now (although it is a very unlikely scenario) is that a well-organized letter writing campaign to ABC would make them rethink cancelling the show and force them to bring Alias back onto the air.  Much like happened with Family Guy.  However, in the extremely likely, almost certain, absence of that, at least we have these 5 superb DVD sets to enjoy for a long time to come.",1154908800,8,2309,4.286374133949192
2628643,5,B000H5V8D6,"Five seasons is a good amount for a TV show, but I wish this final season hadn't been shortened and was instead the full 22-24 episodes that a show normally gets. I also think a show like ""Alias"" could've gone on longer, but I'm very pleased at the way they wrapped things up. It seemed like an impossible task with all of the history and loose ends this show accumulated over five seasons. I give them credit for the wonderful job they did. The last few episodes of the show are excellent. I loved the finale, even though my absolute favorite character died. What a way to go, though--out with a bang! I also loved the way Sloane finally got what he deserved--in a way I never imagined, and that enough of the story was left open so that we could still imagine what our favorite characters would be up to if the story continued. All in all, a great final season for a wonderfully creative show that was so well-written and well-acted. Sydney Bristow will always be one of the best female characters in television history. She is so much more than just a kick-butt female spy. Her strength is not in her ability to fight, but in her intelligence and grace and the way she always followed her heart. That's what makes a truly heroic character.",1154822400,46,1242,4.451754385964913

Alias is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Season 5, in its last episodes was much better than in its first few. While Season 2 will always be my favorite, I recommend season 5.

HOWEVER, if you haven't ever seen this show before, then you definitely HAVE TO watch the first four seasons before you watch this one. Actually, no, just buy the first season, watch it and you'll be hooked. It's incredible.",1154822400,6,596,4.3125
2628645,5,B000H5V8D6,"This season can best be described by the title of episode 7, ""Fait Accompli"". A mission accomplisshed. A fact completed. Not since ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" has a series so well wraped up it's plots and characters... much less in such an entertaining and enjoyable fashion. Alias, however, gives us even more closure, and this season as a whole was much better handled.

The addison of new characters were refreshing and cool, while all of our old favorites returned to the screen in order to make Sydney Bristow's life more complicated than it already was. She had to once again lie to best friend Will, reintroduce sister Nadia to the world (after a 9-month coma), all the while struggling with a rough pregnancy and the reapperance of nemesis Sark and Anna Espinosa.

Even through all the crazy Rambaldi-plots, deaths, resurrections, and the global-conspiracy that is Prophet Five, Sydney manages to raise her child. Granted, she misses a few things while in the field, but in the end she gets exactly what she has always wanted. A normal life. And isn't that what we, the audiance, have always wanted for her?

Rambaldi is done away with, and the bad guys are punished. Sydney and Vaughn get their beach-front house with children and friendly vists from past co-workers.

Even while pregnant, Sydney fights back (""It's a funny thing about pregnancy... hormones!""). Her wit is still intact, even as she prepairs to give birth, and uncover the truths behind this mysterious and deadly new agency.

Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin are amazing as usualy, as are other regular Kevin Weissman and Carl Lumbly. New cast addtions include Rachel Nichols as Rachel Gibson, Balthazar Getty as Tom Grace, Amy Acker as Kelly Peyton and Elodie Bouchez as Renee Riene.

Lena Olin returns for several episodes, as Bradley Cooper and Gina Torres reutrn for the 100th episode (Which, by the way, is amazing!). Merrin Dungey also makes a comeback... this time, as Francie.

It's a season of major change, and huge shocks. Truley the Alias we have all comne to love. It's sad to see them go, but it was one hell of a ride, especally with the beath-taking series finale.

2628647,5,B000H5V8D6,"I'll keep this short, and just say - this season was amazing. Exactly why I fell in love with Alias five years ago. Smart writing, amazing acting, and thrilling stories. So I'll just give you a quick list of my 5 favorite episodes of the season:

5) ""30 Seconds"" - Nadia finally comes out of her coma, but the consiquences of her anger regarding Sloane may just send her father over the deep end. Meanwhile, as Page 47 makes a comeback, Syd offeres Renee a job.

4) ""Fait Accompli"" - This episode really felt like the first two season. We start with a mission in Rome, and still have two more countries to travel too! One mission involves Syd and Renee, the other all of APO, and the last Tom and Dixon. The final scene is hilarious, and for the first time we get a good idea as to what Sydney is up against.

3) ""Prophet Five"" - This episode is fantastic. It deals not only with the aftermath of last season, but also introduces brand-new stories and characters. One of the saddest Alias episodes ever, Jennifer Garner shines here.

2) ""All The Time In The World"" - Part two of the series finale is awesome. Flashbacks reveal Syd's childhood, and how she came to live the life of a spy. Meanwhile, in present time, we pick up where the last episode left off: APO has been destroyed, and Sydney is lying lifeless at the bottom of an icy cavern in Italy. It only gets better from there, folks.

1) ""Maternal Instinct"" - Spy momma is back, and badder than EVER. Seriously, Lena Olin is awesome here... especally when she is playing off of Jen and Victor. Sydney has her baby as she and her parents search for 'The Horizon' in Vancouver. A huge cliffhanger reveales the fate of a character who we once thought to be long-gone.

Get this set! It is well worth it. The final season is simply fantastic, and exactly what it needed to be. Long live Alias!",1154476800,8,1848,4.388888888888889
2628648,5,B000H5V8D6,"This is exactly what I had hoped for. After two perfect seasons, the following two dropped to `near-perfect'. This season, however, bring us back to the first two. The writers supplied a great balance of personal and work stories for our main spy, Sydney Bristow, as well as giving members of the supporting cast intriguing and exciting subplots.

My favorite was the story of Arvin Sloane. His character has always been twisted, double-crossing, and was never what he seemed. He started out as the villain of all villains, but eventually, we got to put some pieces together. He had a loving wife... who was dying. His love for Sydney was real, as well. Eventually, we discovered the root for all his evil - Milo Rambaldi. Sloane was obsessed with discovering Rambaldi's promise of immortality. Not for himself, however... for his wife, Emily, who was dying of cancer. After that, we even discovered HOW he became obsessed with Rambaldi... after the loss of his first daughter, Jacquelyn, he felt as though he had a void in himself - one that only Rambaldi could fulfill.

Here, we see Sloane slowly descend back into his obsession. He tries not too - he had Nadia now, he does not need Rambaldi. But the urge is too strong, and sacrifices his own daughter's life to realize Rambaldi's true endgame. With no family left, Sloane now wants all of the power and greatness for himself... which does not go over well with Sydney and the APO gang.

The seasons revealed so many secrets and betrayals; it feels like season two all over again. Is Irina truly evil? (This question has been foreshadowed several times, and the answer makes complete sense once it comes out) Is Vaughn alive? Who is Sark working for? Is Sloane truly evil? Is Tom the mole? What happened to his wife?

Eventually, all of our questions are answered, and beautiful flashbacks delve into the back-story of our heroin, Sydney. We discover that this was the life she chose... because she was chosen. And in the astounding series finale, she does indeed complete her part in the final prophecy, as she renders the greatest power (Read: Her mother) unto utter desolation.

A fantastic season, with great stories, and heartening, exciting, explosive, and telling moments spread through the fantastic 17 episodes. A clear must-have for all fans of the series.",1154476800,5,2321,4.851010101010101

I want to go away, just you and me and our baby; somewhere no one can bother us, on a deserted island. I want out.""

  -- Sydney Bristow, 'The Horizon'

For five seasons, I have wanted nothing more than to see Sydney and Vaughn get their happy eneding. And they do. For that alone, season five deserves a 5-star rating. Add onto that the spectacular writing, the mind-blowing plot twists, and the tear jerking showstoppers... and this is one hell of a season. Kudos to the amazing cast and crew for five incredible years.",1154390400,5,686,4.294573643410852
2628650,5,B000H5V8D6,"Since the season itself has already been reviewed several times, I thought I would go over the bonus features found in this set. They are all great, and there's a bunch to choose from:

""Celebrating 100 Episodes"" - This promises to be an interesting and up-close look at the making of the fantastic 100th episode, ""Theres Only One Sydney Bristow"". Behind the scenes features are always enjoyable with this series, as the cast gets along so great and is always joking around. It's such an accomplishment for this little show to have reached such a milestone, and I cannot wait to see how the feature turns out.

""Season Five Bloopers"" - By far the best feature on any set. Always hilarious, and each season they get longer and longer. Jen and the entire cast are such goofs... so excited for this!

""The New Recruit: On Set With Rachel Nichols"" - This is probably somewhere along the lines of Marshall's feature last year - a day on the set with Rachel Nichols. We'll get to see what he day-to-day life is like for the new girl on set. I really liked Rachel's character, and am excited to see which episode we trail her for (most likely her big one, ""Solo"")

""Heightening The Drama: The Music Of Alias"" - Most likely a look at how Michael Giacchino writes and produced the shows fantastic signature score. However, it may also focus on how producers choose the original music that is used in each episode (U2, No Doubt, Coldplay...).

""Deleted Scenes"" - Scenes that were cut from the air due to either lack of importance, or the fact that an episode has run too long. Look for many scenes from the series finale, as JJ stated that they filmed a lot of extra footage.

""The Legacy Of Rambaldi"" - A Feature focusing on the life and legacy of fiction character Milo Rambaldi.

Along with these, there will also be commentaries from the cast and crew, Easter eggs, and features that have not yet been released by the studio. I can't wait!",1154390400,7,1933,4.553314121037464
2628651,2,B000H5V8D6,"When Alias started, it was a fun show, with a great mix of suspense, humor, and action. The first and second seasons were some of my favorite television of all time. The third season, while darker, was still well above what I would consider ""average"" television. Would have been a lot better if someone had just put a bullet in Sark's skull and been done with it.  By the fourth season, I felt like the writers were trying a little too hard to recapture the earlier glory. After all the crap Sloan had put these characters through, the thought that anyone would work with him was really stretching.  But, while a little tiresome, it was a fairly good season. Until the cliffhanger at the end of the season. I remember thinking ""Are you kidding me?"" And that pretty much set the tone for season 5 for me.  I watched out of loyalty to Sydney, Jack and all, but it was painful. New characters that I did not even remotely care for or like, silly plots, and a constantly shuffled schedule, made this season akin to getting teeth pulled. There were some good things, especially in the finale, but overall, I'm glad they finally put this one out of its misery. Not a justified exit to a once great show.",1154390400,11,1197,4.45662100456621
2628652,5,B000H5V8D6,"I'll be brief.

Yes - we all know that the first two seasons should be on any list of the best TV shows ever produced. The mixture of over the top spy adventure, which was so over the top it couldn't actually SEE the top, and the disarmingly personal stories and performances that supported it, was staggering. We also all know that seasons 3 & 4 were great, but suffered in comparison to the first two. There's no reason to go into the reasons why here (but they were still great).

Season 5 was a bridge between them. Some changes from the familar (the best being the intro of Rachel Nichols), and some returns to familar ground (ANNA ESPOSITA!! ANNA ESPOSITA!!). The one thing that should be pointed out though, is this. The finale, the two-part finale - my god! It was like a love letter to the things that made the show so great to begin with. And it actually gave a satisfying conclusion to what must be the most complex storyline ever broadcast on American network television. If you lost your way with the show over the years (shame on you), you need to see this. Need.

Wasn't as brief as I thought I was gonna be really.",1154390400,,1130,4.371428571428571
2628653,5,B000H5V8D6,"The title of Alias' 100th episode is so true. Theres only one Sydney Bristow. No one can do it like her. She's smart, strong, beautiful, and sweet. To see her reunited with Will in that episode was great, and it was a perfect stand-alone to throw into the mix before a number of very series mile-a-minute episodes leading to the shows brilliant end.

Everything gets wrapped up nicely, and all the characters - or those who survive, anyway - end up in a good place. It was great to see Lena Olin reprise her role as Irina Derevko for several episodes this season. Her addition was felt much more, as the episodes were spread out, instead of all in one clump.

This seasons main arc was also great. Very smart and well thought out by the writers. While some questions were left unasnwered (Renee's dad) most of them were done away with well. I'm so happy that this final season was as great as it was. I cannot wait to add this set to my collection. Thank you JJ Abrams and ABC for producing such a great series, and Jennifer Garner and her amazing supporting cast for this television classic.",1154390400,6,1092,4.455
2628654,5,B000H5V8D6,"I love seasons 1,2 season 3 was okay but it foused too much on the love triangle and less of what happende to her memory until the near end of the season. I love season 4 because I felt it was getting back on the whole rambaldi situation. And not to mention the show having three of the most beutiful women (Mia Maestro,Jennifer Garner, Lena Olin) who you would really think they are related. But the fifth was awsome alot of twist and turns and you finaly get to see the secrets of Rambaldis true power. This to me was the best Spy show on telivision and I don't think there will be one for a long time.",1154390400,3,604,4.127118644067797
2628655,5,B000H5V8D6,"Michael Vaughn consoles Sydney in the series finale, and truer words have never been spoken. Since the series' debut 5 years ago, Alias has defied expectation, shattered gender roles, and made us all believe that anything is possible.

This season, especially, is a true testament to the genius of these writers and actors. Going into year 5, the show had something huge to prove - that they could work with Jennifer's pregnancy and still produce riveting, exciting, and exceptional stories. And they did. Better, even, than the previous two seasons had.

The story arc for season 5 revolves around the agency behind the death of Vaughn's father... and Vaughn's own murder. Prophet Five - a global terror network with dealings close to those of SD-6 and the Alliance. Over the coarse of 30 years, Prophet Five has based their organization on the texts of a 15th century prophet, and now, they have embedded themselves with 12 worldwide government agencies.

With Vaughn gone, Sydney (along with new recruits Rachel and Tom, and Vaughn's old collaborator, Renee) must discover this group's endgame, and learn how to destroy them before it is too late. Not only are they ruthless and violent, they are smart. Everywhere Sydney goes they have men... even inside the CIA. Amy Acker joins the cast, and provides an Anna to Rachel's Sydney (funny, because Anna also turns up as an agent of Prophet Five).

Jack is weary of Sloane throughout the season. Sloane, who has cut a deal with Prophet Five in order to obtain Nadia's cure, begins to discover that his Rambaldi-obsession may not be over after all. And the consequences of that weigh heavily on one character especially...

As the season comes to a close, Prophet Five's endgame becomes clear. Characters series-spanning agenda's finally come to light, and betrayals and murder from the past seem like nothing compared to what is happening now. Will returns for the fantastic and playful 100th episode, ""Theres Only One Sydney Bristow"" (written as a tribute to both Jennifer and her character), as Sark and Irina both appear in several episodes throughout the season.

Season 5, and the series as a whole, clearly has its faults - but in the end it triumphs. This set is for sure a must-have for all fans, and I highly recommend the series to anyone who has not yet seen it. The characters are real, and the situations are exciting and fresh... Alias rocks.",1154390400,10,2407,4.887254901960785
2628656,5,B000H5V8D6,"Alias' final season does what this show has always done best - shock us. Season 4 had very few actually jaw-dropping moments (Elena's reveal, Vaughn's confession...), but this season brings us back to the good old days of season 1 & 2 where nearly every epispode has at least one moment that will leave you gasping for air.
The first episode is the best premier in a while. While season 4's is awesome to rewatch, this one packs a punch. It wonderfully sets up the rest of the season, and give Sydney the drive she needs to push the story.
Through the next 7 episodes, we meet new characters, learn new stories, and get shock-after-shock (And yes, lot's of pregnant alias')

One of the biggest shocks the series has ever thrown at us comes in episode 9, ""The Horizon"". When the episode first aired, the ABC messages boards were abuzz with ""OMG!"", ""HOLY [...]!"", and ""DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT!?!"".

Look for more of the same in these final 17 episodes. The last few, especally, really bring us back to basics. Theres so much going on that it really feels like season 1 & 2, with added twists (Not to mention all the old characters make apperances!).

In a season where at least 7 main characters are murdered, you know nothing is safe. The writers promised a bang-up finale... and they sure as hell delivered.",1154390400,5,1305,4.54468085106383

It is different becuase it sets up a new mystery, Season 1-3 was a lot of Rambaldi, season 4 was self-centered and stupid, but season five not only closed up the Rambaldi story but it also opened up new ones becasue of the shocking ending in SEASON 4.  This set is well worth your money, it has everything a fan could want, action, suspense, drama, tragedy, suprise, oh yea and a kick butt cast.",1154304000,4,794,4.358108108108108
2628658,5,B000H5V8D6,"In the fifth and final season of ""Alias"", Sydney awakens to discover that fiance Vaughn has been abducted. Not only that, but he is now suspected of being a double agent. When Vaughn makes contact with Sydney, they meet. He tells her about Prophet Five - a global terror organization based on discovering the texts of a 15th century prophet. This was the agency Vaughn's father once worked for, before being killed. Once Vaughn is done explaining (there is quite a bit, which neatly sets up the rest of the season) he and Sydney head off on a rouge mission to obtain a Prophet Five manual.

But when Vaughn makes a dead-drop with his contact, the meeting is ambushed. Vaughn is murdered, and Sydney discovers she is pregnant with his child.

The rest of the season plays out like the first two of the series: each episode brings us closer to solving the mystery of Prophet Five, and what they are all about. Villains are introduced, and like the first season, they can be disposed of at any moment. Twists and shocks come fast and furiously - new recruits are brought into APO, and a pregnant Sydney deals with both work and personal crises.

The introduction of Sydney's pregnancy recovers nicely for the loss of Nadia in the home aspect of the series. Syd may not have a confidante (Although, she is living with newbie Rachel) but she now has her child to worry about. In the first half of the season we watch Sydney worry - will she be a good mother? Can she handle the responsibilities alone, and while working? The second half answers those questions, as we see Sydney balancing work and time with her daughter, Isabelle (As Syd enters deep-cover near the seasons end, we see her pain as she realizes she has missed her daughter's first giggle).

As the personal side of the show gets interesting, so does the spy aspect. This new group - responsible not only for Vaughn's demise, but also the entry of Rachel into APO's core - seems to be more nefarious than anything Sydney has faced. The members are both new and familiar, each more sinister than the last. Not only that, but this new organization bears a chilling resemblance to the Alliance.

This season, however, is not without it's faults... no series ever is. Fans were mostly upset with the fact that Garner could no longer perform her signature stunts. Rachel certainly did not make up for that, as her agent was not yet trained in the field. However, to fans surprise, Renee did a great deal of stunts. Also a new character, Renee Riene was a dangerous fugitive from Vaughn's past, whose father also previously worked with the CIA.

Sloane's subplot involved searching for Nadia's cure, and his slow decent into a Rambaldi obsession. At times this story did drag on, but by the seasons end, it was a major payoff - for both the character, and audience. Marshall continues to supply comic relief through a particularly somber season, and Dixon served as Sydney's partner, and a shoulder to lean on (Although once again, he was often underused).

All in all, the final season was fabulous. Even with its faults, Alias remained leaps and bounds above everything else on television. This final season is way worth the money, and will go down in the books as one of the best TV dramas of all time.",1154304000,,3259,4.637781629116118
2628659,5,B000H5V8D6,"I had never seen ""Alias"" untill this season. Since starring in the short-lived Fox drama ""The Inside"", I have followed Rachel Nichols career. And this is where it led me.

Nichols had a small start on the series, appearing in just once scene in each of the first two episodes this season. Her character, also named Rachel, really caught our eye in the third episode. Rachel Gibson is a technical analyst working for ""The Shed"" - a terror organazation which she believes to be part of the CIA. After discovering the truth, Rachel begins work for the real CIA, being trained as a field agent by Sydney Bristow.

At first, having not seen the previous seasons, I could not understand why audiances had such a cold responce to the character. However, after going back and watching each episode, I understood: Rachel is the exact opposite of every other female character the show has introduced. She is not strong... she is scared, vunerable, and does not believe in herself.

Sydney, however, evntually helps Rachel grow into the spy that she is meant to be... strong, courageous, smart, and beautiful. Along with her personal and work struggles, Rachel also gets a romantic life. First in the form of a one night stand with Julian Sark, and then an actual romance with fellow newbie Thomas Grace.

Rachel is not the main character this season, do not get me wrong. She is just a character that I very much enjoyed. Sydney and the spy family shine this season, as do every other character featured. I was just glad that Rachel Nichols introduced me to such a great show.",1154304000,4,1566,4.704379562043796
2628660,5,B000H5V8D6,"After two near-perfect seasons, Alias' year 3 & 4 seemed to see a slight drop in quality (Both, however, were still better than 99% of anything else on televison). This fifth and final season of the phenominal Spy Drama brings us back to those first two years of greatness.

A pregnant Sydney is out for revenge after her fiance is murdered by the same organazation behind his fathers death (HINT: That would mean Mr. Vaughn's killer, Irina, is involved as well). Not only that, but Sydney must deal with the fact that, once again, Sloane seems to be a good guy. This time, however, she may actually believe it.

With Nadia in a coma, Weiss in Washington, and Vaughn out of the picture, Sydney is basically alone. Jack is now her only true friend, and even he seems to be busy and distant. Sloane's season-spanning subplot is great. As he begins to find Nadia's cure, the once-great villian finds himself struggling for control.

Of the three new cast editions, Elodie Bouchez is by far the stand-out. She plays Renee ""The Raven"" Riene, a mysterious and dangerous criminal from Vaughn's past. The seasons only major pitfall, though, seems to be a bit of missconception regarding her back-story.

The most controversial aspect of the season was the two-hour finale. Some felt it could have been better. I felt it was exactly what it needed to be. The season was cut short, so yes, the finale was somewhat rushed... but it was still great. Tear-jerking, surprising, and all-in-all a great wrap-up, ""All The Time In The World"" did exactly what it had to.

The Rambaldi plot, by some, was said to be unclear. That's not at all true. Go back and watch every episode, and you will see that it was all forshadowed. Sydney has never seen the ""Sky beyond Mount Subastio"" (Not the way she was supposed to, through the amulet - See episode 16) and so she therefor was still rightfully The Chosen One. Here she takes down the greatest power, and completes the Prophecy.

Despite what some may say, this season was excellent. A great step-up from the previous seasons, and a major series triumph. Alias will forever be my favorite series.",1154304000,6,2125,4.698924731182796

Prophet Five, this years villian, has many connections to SD-6 and the Alliance. Sydney also has a vested interest in taking them down, for reasons which are revealed in the premier.

The TV father, Michael Vartan's disappearnce from the show added a very sad dimention to it, all in all, this proved to be too much change all at once for most fans. Nevertheless, many endured with the encouragement to ""trust the writers - they know what they are doing.""

Season 5 turned in some excellent episodes, and some of the worst of the series. ""Out of the Box"" ended up being nearly pointless to the broader story lines, and ""Bob"" had no basis at all for existing. It is my belief that these might have been intended to serve a purpose before ABC brought the hammer down and cancelled the show.

Regarding the ratings drop, I might ask what in the world would you expect when the show is moved around to different days and different times, even in the middle of a season? ABC never respected the brilliance of this show, and therefore caused a self-destruct by moving the show around, limiting the creator's desire to delve into the realm of religion, and forcing the producers to make self-contained episodes. That notwithstanding, the show survived by viture of the genius of its foundational characters, stories, and the excellence of the actors.

As season 5 came to the promised hiatus (for the purpose of allowing Garner a maternity leave), the bad episodes were easily dismissed with a surprise return of a favorite character. The fans were blown away and greatly a-buzz with anticipation to find out what was truly happening.

During the hiatus, the announcment of cancellation broke the heart of ALIAS fans accross the world. Yet, all were eager for the resolutions and answers promised. Supposedly, all the questions would be satisfied.

After the return, every episode seemed to get better and better. The writting really took off, but also brought back the ""feel"" of seasons 1 and 2, especially with ""There's Only One Sydney Bristow."" Some disliked the ending, others took a while before getting on board with where the story was going, but it was obviously going somewhere. Soon, character began to disappear, sending shockwaves through the fan-base that shook the hopes of any supposed scenario. Yet still, we suspended any disbelief, believing that, if they can catch us off guard like that, they are really going to turn the end on its ear.

The Series Finale was promised to be a full two hours, two episodes in a row. The first maintained a pace that left the heart pounding, and no one could deny the direction. Then the last episode came. There were tear-jerking moments, unexpected events, and devistating resolves. Unfortunately, it left most of us feeling flat and unsatisfied.

Over many months of discussion on message boards, we, the fans, believe the writers painted themselves into a corner with the sci-fi aspect of the Rambaldi mystery. He was an important piece to every season, but it took it into the realm of the rediculous. The acting never failed to be perfection, even when the green-screen was too obvious behind them. The relationships between the characters were always wonderful, even if minorly twisted by the Rambaldi-influence.

Over-all, the show still outshines almost everything on TV. It is a worthy watch. Every other season deserves a full five star rating, and you cannot watch the others without watching the end. I am sorry that it is over, and if there is ever any spin-offs or theater-movies, I am totally on board.",1154304000,8,4027,4.945266272189349
