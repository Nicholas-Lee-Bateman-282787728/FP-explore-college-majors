My cheap Philips DVD player with HDMI upgrade plays PAL DVD's. So did my old Apex. Anyway, this concert is top notch as long as you have a PAL DVD player and a good receiver. I didn't like the regular sound, it all came out of the front speakers. My receiver has certain 'Hall' sets for audio. The cellar hall setting set it with a killer 5.1 sounding sound. I don't know if your receiver will give this DVD a killer sound or not, but if it does, you're in for a killer treat! The old Running Wild DVD 'Live' is OK, but it has loud unfiltered flash blasts that sound like they could hurt speakers. It's also PAL. I would have given this DVD 5 stars if I hadn't had to adjust the sound. This is a really good concert! Last chance, Running Wild is calling it quits. Great Band! Killer Riffs! Well represented here. Metal Lives! Rock On!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1324166400,,1048,4.492146596858639

This is a PAL DVD ! I just got mine and it will not play in my player.
Thanks for screwing me over Amazon!",1318204800,2,184,3.5121951219512195
