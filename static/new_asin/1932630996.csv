I highly recommend Doctorji's instructions.  The most important ""element"" for us is AIR, we need it to live and have proper health.  Also, we need WATER - good, clean water - and it should be free to ALL - a natural right!  We need to put ourselves in touch with the EARTH.  To lie upon the earth, to rest, to feel its natural vibrations, like a child upon its mother's breast.  All these elements will provide us with FIRE - the fire of life - energy to think and move and live to the fullest!",1276128000,3,629,3.984
