2397440,5,B000AYELWE,This dvd is a favorite in our house.  My two year old would watch it daily if he could.  I like that he gets to learn about his favorite subject (trains) and have fun at the same time.  One of the best aspects about the dvd is that it is appropriate and entertaining for all age groups.  There is music and fun remote locations plus enough details about trains to teach both children and adults something new.,1196553600,7,409,4.2727272727272725

8080735,5,B000AYELWE,My Grandson is addicted to trains....all about trains.  So I try to get him anything that is educational about trains.  He really enjoys the movies and I have 2 more grandsons coming up under him to pass them along to.  Hopefully they all will enjoy the train movies and the collection of trains that we have.  Lots of fun for the whole family.....Grandpa has gotten involved and now the trains really roar..,1390780800,,408,4.625
8080736,1,B000AYELWE,"We thought we were buying a video with nothing but trains.  Turns out it's mostly an informational DVD with some kid narrating almost all the way through it.  My two-year-old wines everytime the kid comes on.  If you're looking for something for older children so that they can learn about trains, this video is fine.  But, if you are looking for just train video, let this one roll down the track.",1274659200,2,398,4.563380281690141
