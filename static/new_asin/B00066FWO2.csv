I couldn't believe when I saw this on Amazon as I contacted the company many times for a replacement and they don't make them anymore! So, I had to get it. My DVD player stopped working so I'm using my VCR again and this tape is perfect for my workout. It is a nice steady pace so you don't realize the time goes by and you have walked almost 2.0 miles. I have weights I use as the tape utilizes weights while walking so its a good workout for your arms as well. The hills are not too hard with the speed. I hope this one doesn't wear out before I can make a DVD out of it as I am using it 2-3 days a week.",1426204800,,738,3.7070063694267517
