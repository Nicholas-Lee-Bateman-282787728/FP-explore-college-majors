3558773,5,B001F0OPA0,"Ok, This review is not about this dvd release, is about the series. For those English speakers who don't know him Mazinger Z is a japanese animate series from the early 70's. Is base on a comic book from artist Go Nagai. The comic premiere in september of 1972 and it was so popular that by december the tv series was on the air, it ran for 2 years, it has 92 episodes. In the U.S. it was released as Tranzor Z but it was edited so badly and chopped in a manner that is simply not worth watching. The version I saw in Puerto Rico is the uncut one, with good voice acting.

The series is about a giant robot, Mazinger Z and his pilot, young Koji Kabuto who most face the evil mechanical monsters sent by Dr. Hell an evil crazy scientist who wants to rule the world. It sounds simply enough but you most watch the series to understand why even today is so popular, it spawned the whole giant super robot genre. The are a legion of imitators, but Mazinger is the original and the best. The story continued in the spinoff series Great Mazinger and Ufo Robot Grendizer, also by Go Nagai and know in the U.S. under the Shogun Warriors brand. There is an ultimate Mazinger, Mazinkaiser who first appears in a japanese playstatiom game. And there is also a New series running right now in Japan, hopefully it will released over here soon.

So, if you want to have a good time, go and get this one, you are not going to regreat it, You will discover why millions of fan are dreaming of a live action version.
And soon after you will be screaming:"" MAZIN GO!!!, PILDER ON!!!",1256342400,,1564,4.280405405405405
3558774,3,B001F0OPA0,"SI QUERIAS VER OTRA VEZ A MAZINGER, OK ESTE ES EL PRODUCTO. PERO LA EDICION NO ES LA MEJOR.",1251417600,3,91,3.8421052631578947
3558775,5,B001F0OPA0,"Yes, it is what it says it is. Volume One contains 24 the first 24 episodes of the classic Japanese anime Mazinger Z. Typical of Latin American dubbed versions, the orignal music is intact, and the actors attempt to replicate the Japanese performances earnestly--even the pronunciation of names is unintentionally comical.

This release has fairly good sound--taking into account the age of the source material. It's a little tinny, but that's because it IS a little tinny, not due to any fault of the manufacturer of the disc. The episodes flow one right into another, often with a few seconds of lost sound. Other than title card sequences, there are no credit sequences.

The episodes are divided into three sets. Though you can choose each episode within each set in the menu, when one episode ends the next begins automatically, which is kinda nice.

Overall this is a welcome set! Classic stuff, well done!

NOTE: I picked up Volumes One and Two (which contains an additional 23 episodes) recently. I can only guess there will be four volumes in total. The DVD menu makes reference to La Serie Completa.",1221350400,7,1109,4.851851851851852
8300147,1,B001F0OPA0,"the only up side to this is the shipping...one word bootleg rip off suck's dvd it self has more quality than the video content on it, i used it as a coaster for a while before using it as a frisbee and it wasn't even good at being a frisbee.",1395705600,,241,3.84
8300148,1,B001F0OPA0,I feel totally bamboozled! First off the movie not only lacks English subtitles....but any subtitles at all!  And the quality was absolutely horrible!  Guess you get what you pay for!,1370822400,,183,5.066666666666666
8300149,5,B001F0OPA0,"love this cartoon i grew up on this in the 80s late 70s brings back childhood memories, its a good buy",1363737600,,102,3.9047619047619047
8300150,4,B001F0OPA0,I saw this wonderful program back in 1978 when aired in Spain. We could only see 32 episodes because in spite of its colossal success the authorities found it too violent. Although some reviewer disliked the Castilian Spanish dubbing (the way we saw it here)and being respectful I'll say there is no comparison in terms of quality with the Latin American dubbing. Spanish professionals had been considered maybe the best all over the world in terms of dubbing. The good ones were really good and the bad ones were really bad. When I saw the Latin American version I couldn't help but laugh. Those Mexican accents were too thick to take them seriously.,1355011200,,651,4.769911504424779
8300151,3,B001F0OPA0,"I grew up watching Mazinger Z and many other cartoons from the 80's. This is the exact version I remember (I'm from Mexico), with the same dub work and everything. The image and sound looks and sounds the same like back then so don't expect any quality improvement (not bad though, still better than when I recorded the show in my old Beta Max tapes).
The DVD print work looks cheap and it would've been nice to have some subtitles, or more languages available (Japanese, English), but overall the product is not bad and is as advertised. No bad surprises.
I'll probably order the next volumes since I'm a fan of the series. I'd recommend it for fans of the show who understand Spanish fluently.",1347926400,,695,4.568
8300152,2,B001F0OPA0,"The DVD is in spanish (100 Minutos- Audio En Espanol) It says so right on the cover, but the product details also say the DVD has english subtitles.
NOT THE CASE!
Major bummer since I haven't had to speak any spanish since 7th grade and I wasn't even that good at it then.",1342483200,5,272,4.150943396226415
8300153,1,B001F0OPA0,"I agree with the other review.  In the copy I have, you can hear a digital noise and the chapters have a horrible flow to them.  I just wish I could get my money back for this item.",1337299200,3,181,3.736842105263158
8300154,1,B001F0OPA0,"As I said in the title, this dvd is an absolute piece of you know what.....terrible, the video quality is I would say 7 over 10. But what it really bothered me the most is the audio, it is Spanish but from Spain, it's not the Latin America version dubbed in Mexico like the one almost everybody in Latin America remembers from their childhood.

In fact there are 3 dubbed Spanish versions of this series, one from Spain which was watched in Spain only, one from Puerto Rico which was watched only in that country and the one dubbed in Mexico which was watched in all South America and almost all Central America as well. So if the one you remember is the Mexican dubbed version then I wouldn't recommend you to buy this dvd.

The Spanish version from Spain is so, so, so annoying, I don't mean to be disrespectful but why in heaven they chose to dubbed Koji's voice with a woman? Koji sounds so feminine, it's so clear that the one doing the voice is a girl...terrible!

It only comes with one dvd and it only has the first 6 episode out of 92 total episodes this anime from the 70's has.

So over all, don't waste your money on this, it's just not worthy",1303257600,9,1155,4.284403669724771
8300155,1,B001F0OPA0,"I watched these Mazinger Z cartoon when I was growing up in South America. They were the best cartoons ever made at the time and certainly a piece of history if you want. These DVDs sold here are supposed to  be made in Mexico and are allegedly stamped DVDs (not mere DVD-R copies). However, I have to say that the quality of the video (image) is awful. It is comparable with bad VHS copy. The audio is not normalized, so you'll get ""jumps"" in the volume from one episode to the next, and from the head/tail of the episode to the episode itself. The menu is terribly made. It has no professional appearance, the pointers don't work properly and in the copy I received the DVD got frozen at a point and I had to eject it and put it back.
For sentimental people like me I suggest you purchase this series from a distributor in Asia (I got mine from Singapore) where you'll receive for a little bit more money and a little longer wait a product that you can enjoy watching.",1297036800,3,970,4.300546448087432
8300156,1,B001F0OPA0,"No entiendo porque Amazon no ha censurado estas publicaciones ya que el vendedor ofrece productos Piratas y copiados que ni siquieran son de discos originales.

Me aventure a comprar una vez y de verdad la calidad no es la esperada para el precio y las condiciones del producto dan mucho que desear.

Acostumbro a ser buen cliente cuando encuentro un buen vendedor. Les aseguro que no sere cliente de este vendedor una vez mas.

Por el contrario, les recomiendo a los amigos de Kat's Anime que a pesar de no listar en Amazon, ofrecen material de excelente calidad: Candy, Remi, Mazinger, Heidi, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya y cientos de series clasicas y peliculas y de verdad a mi parecer, se esfuerzan bastante bien para dar satisfaccion a sus clientes..

No puedo colocar aca la direccion de su pagina web, pero si googlean usando el tag Kat's Anime los podran encontrar en la primera posicion de resultados. Su pagina es muy famosa en Venezuela. Envian a todo el mundo y aceptan PayPal como medio de pago.

Bueno, tal vez mi opinion no ayude a todos, pero espero ayude a muchos a encontrar un buen grupo donde adquirir sus colecciones de oro.. como yo lo hice. Los recomiendo!.

Saludos.
