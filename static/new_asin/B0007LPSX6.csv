2218919,5,B0007LPSX6,"A family drama filled with twists & turns and nice romantic moments. One of the earlier Danielle Steel films--it boasts a great cast and solid plotlines. It is a story of love, loss, passion, & heartache revolving around three sisters long separated by a family tragedy and the men who reunite & love them.",1204329600,,306,4.685185185185185
2218920,5,B0007LPSX6,"I like how this movie flows.  It is a movie that depicts three sisters reuniting after 30 years apart.  I enjoyed watching how Perry King pursued Jacklyn Smith, turning his business search for three sisters into a romance.  All three sisters are eventually joined together at the Connecticut home of the person responsible for separating them.  Jacklyn Smith's character brings forth her conflict with him and then makes an early departure.  I'd like to think that the sister's kept in touch as time passes to the next scenes of Arthur dying, Megan calling Hillary and all three sister's meeting up again at Arthur's funeral.  As the show ends the three sisters are walking together under black umbrellas consoling each other.

I loved the feel of this movie.  The success of Hillary after obvious struggles.  The touching end with the three sisters together and a hope that they will become close and remain so.",1148688000,12,912,4.908496732026144
2218921,3,B0007LPSX6,"As introduction to this picture, the author of the novel upon which it is based, Danielle Steel, or perhaps an android in her stead, explains in brief the general subject of the work that we are about to see, a formulaic piece composed in about equal parts of female angst and fantasy, akin to the soap opera genre that is her speciality, and to obtain which millions of devotees have shelled out many more millions of dollars for the privilege of reading her committee concocted books, now numbered by the score. The elaborate and melodramatic plot relates of three sisters who, due to the murder/suicide of their parents, are allocated to three separate foster homes and know nothing of each others' whereabouts until, after more than thirty years a family friend, entertainment attorney Arthur Patterson (Donald Moffat), the party responsible for their foster placement, hires a private investigator, John Chapman (Perry King) to locate them and bring about their reunion. Chapman is quite dissimilar from such literary gumshoes as Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, the latter's seven-year-old Pontiac and seedy second story office being far removed from Steel's sartorially perfect sleuth (who becomes a P.I. directly from law school?!) driving to and from his sumptuous high-rise suite in a new Mercedes convertible, but John nonetheless locates the estranged trio and, after becoming beau to the eldest, Hilary (Jaclyn Smith), arranges the sibling gathering that will reveal those hidden familial secrets governing the plot's climax. As might be expected within the Land of Steel, the three have achieved validated status, Hilary being a major television network executive, a second a wealthy socialite, and the youngest a physician, while we observe through flashbacks what occurred to cause their family's dissolution, and are made aware that atonement for past failings of a principal character is a decisive element of a narrative that is unfortunately rather mild and stereotypical. Manifestly made for television, including orchestral crescendos signaling each planned commercial break fadeout, the film is advantaged with an adequate budget and enjoys glossy production values along with sincere efforts from most of the players - King, Patricia Kalember and Ben Lemon each is a standout - offsetting a typically monochromic performance by Smith, and although blocking is not of the best, editing is crisp and one must recognize the accomplished cinematography of Laszlo George and the always appropriate interiors organized by Malcolm Middleton and by Jacques Bradette.",1130630400,12,2584,5.430348258706467
