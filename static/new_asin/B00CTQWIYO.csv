5739852,5,B00CTQWIYO,"Okay - I have a son, not a daughter so I don't get to indulge in girly things often.  All of the tinkerbell/fairy movies however are not as girly as the older movies so my son does love to watch them with me.  This is a short 30 minute episode that has great visuals, jokes and is fast paced.  It was very enjoyable and one of my favorites.",1353456000,,340,3.9705882352941178

5739854,5,B00CTQWIYO,Wondered where this movie had gone and finally read that it was never made into a full blown movie.  Easily downloaded inside my Amazon account and not expensive to do either.  The kids have enjoyed watching it multiple times!,1352160000,,226,4.769230769230769
5739855,5,B00CTQWIYO,"It's longer than a normal short- just over 20 minutes. The story line centers on Rosetta and Chloe. Chloe has been training for the Pixie Hollow Games. Rosetta is terrified of dirt, ironic considering she is a garden fairy. Rosetta gets over her fear when Rumble basically said she needs to go back to just being pretty. This was a good natured show in the spirit of all the other Disney Fairies stories. I wasn't sure how I would like this one, but I'm glad I saw it because I actually really liked it a lot. If your family is a fan of the Disney Fairies franchise, this is definitely for you!!",1351296000,3,595,4.321428571428571

5739867,5,B00CTQWIYO,This was too cute - a story about Rosetta and Chloe in the Pixie Hollow Games. I am not afraid to say I am a fan of those Tinkerbell movies. The movie itself is so short. It could have been a wee bit longer. Enjoyable little film with a focus on Rosetta the Garden Fairy.,1501459200,,271,3.9454545454545453

5739873,5,B00CTQWIYO,"This is a very nice story... it held both of my children captive, and I liked it too.  It was short, but the only reason to complain about that is out of longing for a longer story, because it's so good.  It was nice to see a fairy other than Tinker Bell be the center of the story, and Chloe is a nice character, too.  I hope Disney will develop more stories around other fairies, especially, because there's so much potential there, and my daughter can relate to characters other than blond hair and blue eyed princesses.",1487289600,,523,4.371134020618556

5739883,5,B00CTQWIYO,"The Tinker Bell fairy adventures series is a wonderful set of movies. Tinker Bell and friends go on many great adventures and with each movie you learn more about the fairy friends. This short fairy adventure is all about the Pixie Hollow Games as the title mentions. It's a reference to the Olympic games and was a blast to watch. Our family really enjoyed it, it had lots of humor (even some for the older viewers) and a great lesson for kids to learn. The lesson was about how you should support those who believe the team can win and not be a downer just because you failed in the past. I purchased the SD version of the movie as it was cheaper, doesn't come with bonuses for HD and it's a kids movie. Bonus: Since it's a Disney movie it attaches to your Disney Movie Anywhere app (if you connect the two accounts). I hope this review was helpful in your purchasing decision.",1479772800,,879,4.365853658536586

5739959,5,B00CTQWIYO,"""Pixie Hollow Games"" is an amazing little treat for fans of the ""Disney Fairies"" franchise...and especially for Rosetta fans.  But let it be known, this is a mere 22-minute ""special episode"" and not a full-length feature.  As such, unless you are a completist who has all the other films but this one, you are better offer purchasing the Blu-Ray edition of ""The Secret of the Wings"" which has this special included as an extra, or just to get a digital copy of this.

But anyways, to the film:
CONTENT ISSUES: No issues whatsoever.

PLOT ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS:
Basically, this is an underdog story and it's storyline isn't all that complexed.  However, I found it amazing how moving this was even though it was only 22-minutes long.  The tale centers around Rosetta who is forced to join in the Pixie Hollow games with Chloe, a teammate who is a brand new inductee to the Garden fairies.  Of all the teams, the Garden Fairies have had long since given up on even lasting a day...and Rosetta is no different.  Even though the story is simple and not complexed, what I loved was the dynamic between Chloe and Rosetta...Rosetta being more of a realist and Chloe being an over the top (but not inconsiderate) optimist.  As these two opposing views struggle to find common ground in this competition it reveals many things about these two characters...but especially Rosetta.  I loved the fact that the production team did not just paste this together haphazardly for a quick buck, but they really seemed to put their hearts and minds into it...it's always progressing and never feels stagnant.  And you definitely feel the emotions of the characters.  In the end, what I loved most was not the obvious end, but the inspiring journey and growth that these two characters experienced...and which led to Chloe saying, ""Rosetta, you've made me so proud to be a Garden Fairy.""

5740072,4,B00CTQWIYO,"We are pretty big fans of Tinkerbell and her friends and the Pixie Hollow films are all very different but good.  This one involves a sort of Olympic style games for the fairies, with Rosetta being forced to participate after dodging it for years.  Overall, a short (more like a tv episode than a movie) film that introduces another new fairy and is entertaining enough.  I would recommend it if you have a big Tinkerbell fan in your house.",1400457600,,440,4.544303797468355
5740073,5,B00CTQWIYO,"This is one of the shorter Tinkerbell movies in the entire series. You do not have to watch the other movies to understand the plot line, it is pretty simple to follow. It is a cute watch with some great laughs for the family. Dig Deep!",1400371200,,236,4.1521739130434785

(It was good for keeping kids entertained for a while.) I wish they made a bunch of these Tinker Bell shows. If you read the books, it is similarly creative but with more action and more characters.",1400112000,,364,4.140845070422535

5740079,5,B00CTQWIYO,My son loves this movie.  It's perfect for that end-of-the-night short movie when you only want your kids up for another 30 minutes before the night time routine needs to take place.  It's a nice little short show rather than throwing in a long movie when you know bedtime is right around the corner.,1399248000,,300,4.537037037037037

I always find myself wondering how these aren't marketed more.  Are they theatrical releases?  Because we would pay to see them in the theater, but I never remember any of them having theatrical releases, except maybe the first?

5740108,1,B00CTQWIYO,"Pixie Hollow Games is just 22min long credits and previews included. In fact is just a trumped up TV length episode that should have been a bonus for a Full movie. Instead it's a misleading ploy to make it look full length to steal people's money.  The plot is rushed and sloppy even for a children's show, and Disney should at least have added a coupon to an upcoming film or made this one long enough to justify the $9.95 price. I will not buy another Disney Fairy DVD for a gift again and I urge people considering this to beware.",1392076800,,533,4.2772277227722775

5740118,5,B00CTQWIYO,Originally planned to be a full length feature for the London Olympic year this is more of a short film that fills in between the other major films (Secret of the Wings I think?) For kids that love the animated Tinkerbell series it completes what Pixar has released so far until the new film comes out in April 2014. Not a full length movie but loved by the little one.,1389484800,,369,4.285714285714286

The characters are great.",1389398400,,126,4.521739130434782
5740120,4,B00CTQWIYO,"My husband and I purchased this (through Amazon directly on our television) for our almost five year old daughter, and as with many of the shows we watch with our daughter, we fell in love with this short, but funny, movie. The movie is about, as the name suggests, games in Pixie Hollow. The various fairy teams must compete in various categories (frog hopping anyone?) in order for one team to emerge as victor and to claim bragging rights for the year. The only problem is that the lightening and thunder fairies (and an annoying competitor who refers to himself in the third person) have won the games for several years and the garden fairies have NEVER won.

Anyone over the age of 10 will know where the story is going and how it will end, but the refreshing characters make it all worth one's while.

The only reason this movie gets 4 stars is because there just wasn't enough. There should have been clips on how the fairies train (and I know I watched clips about the same on YouTube, so I can't figure out why the movie itself does not have some of those elements present within itself), how and why the lightening and thunder fairies have been winning for so long, why the garden fairies have never won etc. etc.",1388966400,,1223,4.479820627802691
5740121,3,B00CTQWIYO,short.  all the other tinkerbell movies are about 45 minutes long so I was disappointed in the length of this movie.  Otherwise its cute,1388966400,,136,4.625
5740122,5,B00CTQWIYO,Very nicely done and cute I wish that it was longer thin 22min but it is very cute I love TinkerBell and her friends !,1388707200,,118,3.76
5740123,1,B00CTQWIYO,"Agreeing with all the 1 star people this movie is way to short and Disney just used it as a filler. It was a cute concept but wasn't well thought out and isn't worth paying for this is more like a 30 minute special that should be played on Disney channel in between tinkerbell movies. My daughter watches it and says more mommy, and I can't explain that it's not mommy's fault. It's such a cute idea just just wasn't executed, seems like someone lost track of time developing. I would suggest not buying unless you want to keep pushing play, just not worth it unless maybe 2.99. Sad to see Disney disappoint.",1388448000,6,608,4.389380530973451
5740124,5,B00CTQWIYO,"This is a cute little show. I like that it is relatively short, not an entire full feature-length film. I like to put on a show for my three year old when I shower, to keep her out of trouble, but I don't necessarily want her watching TV all day, so the shorter length is perfect.  I also love the affordable Amazon $4 digital price for the shorter content, versus the full-length Tinkerbell movies that average $15.

The graphics and animation are gorgeous.  Best of all, the story is cute and even as an adult I can enjoy it.  Some morals of the story are teamwork, honest sportsmanship, trying your best, and conquering a fear of failure.

I would love to see more stories from Disney starring the other Pixie Hollow fairies, not just Tinkerbell. She's cute, but they have created a great fairy universe of so many characters I would love to see more about.",1387756800,,860,4.487179487179487

5740132,5,B00CTQWIYO,My 3 year old girls love this.  They ask to watch it over and over.  I love it because it is less than 30 minutes long so I can use it as a reward for good behavior,1382313600,,164,3.4054054054054053

5740135,4,B00CTQWIYO,A surprisingly well-written and enjoyable story.  It's much more aggressive than the other fairy stories.  It would have been better if it wasn't so short because it feels like it's rushing through the story too quickly.,1380758400,14,220,5.083333333333333

wonderful story of friendship, overcoming challenges, teamwork, and sportmanship.

every tinkerbell story thus far leaves you with a good and warm feeling afterwards and this is no different. my advice, just buy the deluxe set for secret of the wings.",1380326400,,512,4.795454545454546

I wish it was a longer movie, but its still a good little show for you to put on for your kids and let them watch it while you finish dinner or if you let them watch a show before bed time.  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is only because of it being short, but quality of the movie is really good.",1366502400,,490,3.7941176470588234

Story is cute with a good theme and short enough (only 20 minutes long) that we can watch the full video with her full attention and without having to give up an hour of time.  The Disney Fairies is a great franchise, and this is a great mini-movie to give your kids their ""fairy"" fix.",1361404800,,466,4.333333333333333

5740190,3,B00CTQWIYO,"As an avid Disney fan, and lover of all Disney movies I must say that I am a bit disappointed with this film. It is more suited to be like a television series episode than a movie. It was not up to snuff with the other Tinkerbell films. It's a nice addition however, I would have rather this be tacked on to one of the Tinkerbell films as an extra feature or something similar to that than to have it's own movie. It's a bit more childish that the Tinkerbell films and yes it does have some good moral fiber, ""friendship, supporting one another, etc..."" however, it was lacking the Disney Magic that I've come to love and adore in all Disney films.",1361318400,,648,4.276422764227642

5740195,2,B00CTQWIYO,"My preschooler absolutely loves the four full length Tinkerbell movies.

But this is not like them at all. Rosetta come across as a silly Diva, there is lots of rolling of the eyes, dumb jock humor, sarcasm, very unfriendly. Tinkerbell only shows up in a couple of brief scenes.

I skipped through different scenes and it didn't get any better. Disney lost the magic on this one.",1359504000,2,379,4.641791044776119

It's a terrific story of sportsmanship, teamwork, and friendship!  I was really amazed how in a short 23 minutes that all those wonderful themes can be conveyed.  Bravo Disney!  Another great production.",1359331200,,440,4.636363636363637

5740206,4,B00CTQWIYO,"Disney's Fairies series staring TinkerBell and her friends are all really great. Though this story features Tink in a cameo of sorts, the real stars of the Pixie Hollow Games are Rosetta and Chloe (a new fairy introduced in this story). The two Garden fairies form a team to win the Pixie Hollow games, which is like the fairy olympics and each of the different talent fairies battle it out for the top spot. The reigning champs are the Storm fairies and no one thinks the Garden fairies stand a chance. You'll have to watch to see how it turns out.

My only complaint is I wish is was a bit longer, but c'est la vie. It was a 30-minute special that originally aired on TV to begin with. The only other issue was the quality of the Amazon On Demand. I would have liked it to be better, but it was okay and didn't detract from the story.",1357171200,8,836,4.2578616352201255
