This film isn't a tribute to chapman it gives us an idea of the things he went through, and the story behind his decision to kill John Lennon.  Check it out, also, Jared Leto did a great job, i've seen other portrayals of chapman, and Leto's is the best.",1230595200,,425,4.108433734939759
3465320,3,B001AR60GK,"Chapter 27 does not glamourize Mark David Chapman. He's just as pathetic and disturbed here as in real life. We simply follow along, sitting on his shoulder, hearing his thoughts as he becomes even more detached and mentally unstable, all the while uplifting himself as a heroic Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye. Chapter 27 does not praise Chapman, nor does it put down John Lennon. It just lets us follow along a pathetic and disturbing journey - a piece of history we may never come to understand.

Jared Leto goes through a virtual metamorphosis, disappearing physically and mentally into Chapman, making the film all the more unnerving to watch, as there is something always slightly offputting, askew or creepy about him. For all accounts, it's a great performance.

Lindsay Lohan serves as the new aquaintance, a character so dreadfully normal that she's neither loveable or hateable, but despite going through the entire film giving forth her lines with a sort of upstrung bewilderment, she delivers a decent performance. Jared goes far, Lindsay doesn't, and that's what works about it.

I can't really recommend Chapter 27 in the traditional sense. You'll have to ask yourself if you're motivated and ready to see a film like this, because unless you feel some kind of connection to it, it becomes virtually pointless.",1226016000,,1334,5.027149321266968
3465321,4,B001AR60GK,"Let's get this straight. This is NOT a BIO-PIC. It is  a PORTRAYAL of a three day  John Lennon autograph hunting expedition of the psychologically deranged Mark David Chapman. With that in mind, the film does not give the background information others are longing for, a history so to speak of Chapman's life. If you want that, this is NOT that film. let's stop focusing on what this film is NOT and start praising what it IS.

It is a monumental acting effort by Jared Leto. He is not 'acting' as Chapman. He IS Chapman. I truly believe he is in this film. That is a hard achievement to pull off for any actor ,. To totally encompass a role beyond what is called for to the point you cannot tell the difference between the actor and the person he is portraying. The only difference being that Chapman could never be as facially appealing.

Some have said Lindsay Lohan helps the film as Jude. I diagree. Her role is shallow, without any background or substance. Her acting is perfunctory, nothing more. Any actress could have played this role better. When you compare Leto's dedication and Lohan's non chalant attitude you see who paid their dues and who just showed up for a check.

On the other hand Paul Freilander is the balance in this story and his performance is great. He is neither hindered nor fooled by Chapman yet he somehow is drawn to share the same sidewalk. One wants a photo for a sale, the other an autograph, then to kill. The autograph seeker has never been played or seen in such sensitive light and with such insight into pyschosis. The long wait outside the dakota in a cold December is shown through Chapman's ramblings. Somehow you are DRAWN into his psychosis.
It all blends into one homogenous mind numbing delusion. You almost seem HAPPY he gets that autograph. The fact Lennon even asks him ""Is that all you want"" adds to the horror of the inevitable. I guarantee you  by 1980 none of the other Beatles would have been this cordial in person. (Harrison was a well known recluse and was always weary of fans (for good reason), Ringo rarely took photos with fans to this day and Mccartney sightings on public streets are very well guarded).

The films 84 munute running time DOES leave you asking questions. The title of the film is not clearly explained. Chapman's total motivation whether by the Devil or the BOOK (Catcher) is not totally identified and apparantely there are a number of historical inaccuracies such as Sean's care taker being a polite English woman is a misnomer. Unimportant to the total scope of the film.

 What you are witnessing is an ACTING TOUR DEFORCE by LETO and an equally fine supporting acting peformance by Freilander. I would have nominated BOTH for Golden Globes at the least.
This film is only boring if you cannot sit still for 30 seconds and do not like to listen and get inside the head of characters. Indeed I find it riveting. The film score is sensitive and well done. The direction is interesting and terse. I think this is a very well done film. A little more enhancement of script would have helped. No one mentioned if the DVD has any DELETED scenes which migh help explain some things. Are there deleted scenes?",1225497600,16,3186,4.595070422535211
3465322,1,B001AR60GK,"I was really excited when I rented this movie. I thought it would be interesting, informative, and an in-depth look at a famous psychotic, Mark David Chapman. Unfortunately, this movie offered none of these things. All it did was span the 3 days prior to Lennon's murder through the eyes of Chapman (Jared Leto). It gave no real background of Chapman's life before he came to NY, except that he had a super-Christian wife and used to live in Hawaii.  As for the Catcher in the Rye references, they were mundane and weak, a simple throwing in of some flash-backs to fields of rye as some poor attempt at visual artistic metaphor. The film kept pushing the same facts over and over for an hour and a half. Yes, he was crazy. Yes, he lived alone and was homicidal and obsessive. But why? I wanted more, some delving into his mind, some history to the man. why did he commit the murder? was he always this way? how did he become a fan of the Beatles in the first place? was there any family conflict or a bad childhood that created this monster? all these questions and more are ignored and instead, the audience is served a cold helping of superficial cinema that barely scratches the surface of this world-reknown, earth-shattering event: the murder of a Beatle. I could have just watched the Discovery channel and learned more and not have had to suffer Lindsey Lohan's attempt at being a serious actor. Blah.",1224460800,,1408,4.565217391304348

Both should have been nominated for Oscars.

3465324,4,B001AR60GK,"In early December 1980 Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon.  John Lennon was not a mere celebrity at the time.  He had moved beyond the Beatles and formed a solo career where he was spreading a message that was clicking with society as the message of love and unity in a time when the country was in deep turmoil.

This independant film is handled with a lot of care and great detail.  Jared Leto provides an amazing performance as he fully becomes Mark David Chapman.  He even put on 60 pounds for the role and the similarities in appearance are uncanny.  The film does limit itself for it merely takes place over the 3 day period Mark is in New York and ends with the killing.  The film is told throughout by the thought process of Mark and all the facts are correct.  The problem is it leaves a lot of unanswered questions and if a viewer does not know all the facts they won't get everything.

The film does excellently portray that without question he is not of sound mind.  He hears voices, continuosly talks within his head and flitters from thought to thought.  He appears manic, psychotic and out of touch.  John Lennon is merely a sad part of his psychosis.  The facts - Mark David Chapman thought J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE was the bible and took on the persona of the main character Holden Caulfield who believed most of society was phony and despised the elite.  Mark David Chapman had loved the Beatles and wasn't as fond of John Lennon as a solo artist which is shown here.  He is very angered over Lennon's comment when a Beatle ""We are bigger than Jesus"" and was very angry that John spread a message of love yet had millions due to his success that started with the Beatles which he wanted to separate himself from.

The movie MONSTER with Charlize Theron was an excellent portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos and the film provided background material that may answer questions as to why she developed the way she did.  This film leaves Mark's very important background alone - escape into music, many attempts at suicide, heavy drug use and abusive family.  Definite strong signs of mental illness/depression.  He also had done a lot of great charity work around the world.

Some try to point this towards being a stalker situatuion that turned to murder.  I believe it was a lot more than that.  They say Mark did it to become famous himself.  He remained at the scene after shooting John Lennon.  But when knowing all the facts this does not make sense.  Also, he pleaded guilty by reason of insanity and then took that back and just pled guilty.  he has had 4 parole hearings - all denied - the last in 2008.  He admits what he did was wrong and even apologizes to Yoko Ono for the effect on her.  For once the judicial system seems to be doing its job and are keeping him in, saying he is still a danger to himself and others.

The important thing here for me is mental illness and how its effect on many crimes is often overlooked.  It is not an excuse by any means but should be studied closely.  This film for what it does show over those 3 days is impeccable.  Jared Leto illustrates the complexities in the mind of Mark David Chapman that the script was vague on.  Lindsay Lohan is also very good as a fellow fan who befriends Mark and you see through her reactions towards him over time how he is different and creepy.  He has outbursts and to me appears bipolar.

A tragedy of the highest poroportion occured when John Lennon was killed but I think this is obviously not a mere celebruity stalking.  John Lennon became the target due to his message and being human.  Mental illness is a huge part and must be given its due.  The punishment should be the same but we should learn from these cases.",1223683200,3,3745,4.4449339207048455

3465326,1,B001AR60GK,"The first thing you have to do if you want to understand ""Chapter 27,"" the film about the assassination of John Lennon, is read ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Catcher-in-the-Rye/dp/0316769177/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Catcher in the Rye</a>,"" J.D. Salinger's classic novel of disaffected youth, originally published in 1951. The book, narrated in the pitch-perfect adolescent voice of hypocrisy-hating Holden Caulfield, is what ""inspired"" Mark David Chapman to murder Lennon--because he believed that the reclusive, super-wealthy rock star who sang ""Imagine no possessions"" was, in the words of Holden, a ""goddamn phony.""

Throughout the film, Chapman refers to the book, quotes from it, and imagines and acts out scenes from it. But unless ""Catcher's"" fresh in your mind, you often won't know that that's what he's doing. For example, the scene in the coffee shop where Chapman (Jared Leto) asks Jude (Lindsay Lohan) to run away with him is a direct steal from chapter 17 of ""The Catcher in the Rye""--which I didn't realize till I reread the book after I saw the movie.

""Catcher"" also partially explains the film's title, an essential bit of information that writer/director Jarrett Schaefer has neglected to share with his audience. Schaefer does give some indication that the title ""Chapter 27"" is a reference to the Salinger novel. And he does show some pages from ""Catcher"" in the opening sequence, focusing on chapter numbers 9 and 26. But he doesn't make explicitly clear that ""Catcher"" ends on chapter 26 and that Chapman, who saw himself as the reincarnation of Holden Caulfield, believed that if he shot Lennon five times in the back, then he'd write chapter 27 in the ex-Beatle's blood. That, at least, is how I explain it in my own Lennon bio, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nowhere-Man-The-Final-Days-of-John-Lennon/dp/0932551513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon</a>,"" which is the second book you have to read--because it's the only book that explains how the number 27 karmically links Chapman to Lennon.

Anybody who's been following my Amazon blog already knows that, according to Mojo magazine and the Spanish-language newsweekly Proceso, Schaefer expropriated his title from ""Nowhere Man's"" ""Chapter 27."" In that section I show how 27, ""the triple 9,"" was a number of profound importance to the ex-Beatle, who was obsessed with numerology, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheiro-s-Book-of-Numbers/dp/B000H5BPLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheiro's Book of Numbers</a>,"" and especially number 9 and all its multiples. (Lennon was born on October 9.)

Perhaps if Schaefer had made this numerological connection, it would have given his film a deeper and more chilling resonance. But choosing instead to completely ignore information that was essential to understanding both the title and the meaning of his story, he simply left it up to the audience to supply their own context, which might be asking a little too much of contemporary moviegoers.

This lack of context may partially explain the hundreds of vicious reviews that have appeared since ""Chapter 27"" premiered at Sundance in 2007. And it may also explain why, despite the presence of two major stars, the film faced such epic difficulties finding a distributor.

But let there be no doubt that amidst this fundamental confusion one extraordinary performance emerges: Jared Leto as Chapman. He doesn't just play the character, he inhabits him. Famously (and perhaps insanely), Leto packed on 60 pounds for the role--in one scene the camera sensuously caresses his rolls of fat. And he is riveting as the murderous nerd who speaks in an absurdly creepy southern-accented whisper and is onscreen for virtually every frame of the film. To watch him is a claustrophobic experience, like being trapped in a room for 84 minutes with a socially awkward psychopath.

It's up to Lindsay Lohan, in her small but appealingly energetic role as Jude, a Lennon fan (based on a real person) who befriends Chapman before realizing there's something wrong with him, to express the discomfort and repulsion you feel in the presence of the aspiring killer.

She has some help from Judah Friedlander as Paul, based on paparazzo Paul Goresh, who, with a well-timed jolt of energy, alleviates the often crushing sense of being a prisoner of Chapman's consciousness. Best known for his comedic work on ""30 Rock,"" Friedlander efficiently portrays the slightly sarcastic regular guy from Jersey who photographs Lennon (Mark Lindsay Chapman) signing Mark David Chapman's copy of ""Double Fantasy"" hours before the murder.

But again Schaefer doesn't give his audience enough background or context to fully understand who these people are and why they're doing what they're doing. You do learn that Chapman's a Beatles fan from Hawaii, who appears to have a wife back home. (Chapman's wife was Japanese, like Yoko Ono, but that's not mentioned.) The movie's confined to the three days--December 6-8, 1980--leading up to the murder, and in that time frame it's almost impossible for Schaefer to show what drove an unemployed security guard to such delusional depths of insanity that he twice traveled 5,000 miles to assassinate a celebrity in the name of Holden Caulfield.

It would have been helpful, for example, to know about the ""Little People,"" the imaginary civilization that populated Chapman's head and the walls of his room since he was a child, and whom he depended on to guide him in his decision-making; to know that when Chapman was a teenager, he played the guitar and dropped a lot of acid; to know that in Hawaii he attempted suicide and spent time in a mental institution; and to know that he was compelled by a desire to transcend his own insignificance and steal Lennon's fame and identity. And it would have been especially illuminating to see Chapman, in his Honolulu apartment, listening to Beatles music in the middle of the night, begging Satan for the power to kill Lennon and chanting, ""The phony must die, says the Catcher in the Rye.""

I wrote about all this in the seven final chapters of ""Nowhere Man,"" ""The Coda,"" where the concept of ""Chapter 27"" is at the forefront of the story and where I probed the meaning of what Chapman did.

Jack Jones also wrote about it in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Let-Me-Take-You-Down/dp/0863696899/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Let Me Take You Down</a>,"" the book credited with inspiring ""Chapter 27."" Though this worthwhile biography fails to explain the numerological implications of Chapter 27 or show how it played into the heart of Lennon's obsession with the number 9, it does, indeed, plumb the ooze of Chapman's mind, from his lunatic point of view, detailing everything you could possibly want to know about the killer's voyage to the depths of the ""bottomless pit"" (see ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" chapter 24, or ""Nowhere Man's"" ""Chapter 27"").

And director Andrew Piddington covered some of this material in that other Chapman movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-of-John-Lennon/dp/B0018PH3K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing of John Lennon</a>,"" which delves into Chapman's background and graphically depicts the actual murder in a way that ""Chapter 27"" doesn't approach.

All this contextual criticism is not to say that ""Chapter 27"" is a ""lousy""--if I may borrow a word from Holden--movie. It's not. It's just a dispiriting and mistitled one. And now that I've seen it, I think I finally understand what Jarrett Schaefer was thinking, at least as far as the title goes. He probably found artistically irresistible both the concept of Chapman writing chapter 27 in Lennon's blood and the idea of Lennon and Chapman being linked by a mystical number. Because he's an inexperienced filmmaker, he probably thought he could graft a cool title onto a movie that had little to do with that title, and just leave it at that. He probably thought most people would either get it or wouldn't care. And he probably believed on some level that the author of ""Nowhere Man"" didn't really exist. Well, he was wrong. And though I'm sure it wasn't his intention, I'd like to thank him for inspiring my Chapter 27 blog.

***

I'd be remiss if I neglected to mention that I knew well two of the people depicted in ""Chapter 27"": John Lennon's assistant and my former writing partner, Fred Seaman (Matthew Humphreys), and Fred's aunt and Sean Lennon's governess, Helen Seaman (Le Clanche DuRand). I must commend Humphreys, in his brief scene with Chapman, for neatly capturing the contemptuousness that Seaman routinely displayed to anybody he found ""beneath"" him (like the fans who hung out at the Dakota). But I must also point out that in the very creepy scene where Chapman meets Sean, Helen, an earth mother from the Bronx, is portrayed as an impeccably dressed upper-crusty English lady.

And now, there is a movie about him.
How do you approach Chapman's clearly deranged psyche and then make a movie out of it? Well, first, you go for the motives. Although the movie only spawns the infamous three days of Caulfield's life, there is enough implied background for us to begin to understand this character. I would never imply Chapman is someone to be understood or forgiven, and neither would Jarrett Schaefer, who directs this movie respectfully and cautiously. He puts Chapman in a number of seemingly random and ordinary situations that all echo the plot of J. D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"". Like its protagonist Houlden Caulfield, Chapman also goes on a trip to New York City to ""find"" himself. An on and off Christian and a Beatles fan, he often ventures into philosophical musings about justice and the state of the world, and it seems that every single thing in life can be accociated with the biggest star in the world at the time, the peace activist John Lennon.
Chapman is played by Jared Leto, in one of those great movie transformations. The overweight Leto may not reach the heights of Nicole Kidman as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Virginia-Woolf/dp/B00005JKTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Virginia Woolf</a>&nbsp;or Charlize Theron as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aileen-Wuornos/dp/B00005JMUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aileen Wuornos</a>, however, he is suitably creepy and disturbing. Lindsay Lohan plays Jude, a young Lennon fan who befriends Chapman. She gives an interesting performance, seeming friendly (bordering on flirty) in the beginning, but then becoming more cautious as Chapman's behavior starts shifting.
""Chapter 27"" is not a perfect movie, but it is interesting, factual and engaging. Although it doesn't really provide any answers, it left me thinking about fandom, destiny and irony. What is the difference between a fan and a stalker? Can mental illness justify a crime? And finally, where do the Central Park ducks go?",1214611200,22,2370,5.994100294985251

Well, I'm guessing the last part, because it doesn't dig deep into motivation. Leto's narration is meant to be intense and psycho, but it was plodding and at times, laughable. At the end of one scene with a very thin prostitute, Chapman/Leto states he wanted to 'kill himself'. I imagine the prostitute, and John Lennon, wish he would have...before meeting them.

3465442,4,B001AR60GK,"Chapter 27 is a film that depicts the murder of John Lennon. It involves the story of assassin,Mark David Chapman during the days leading into the said event. Jared Leto stars in the film as Chapman. He was committed in the role ala Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull by gaining 67 pounds to match the real Chapman's physically. Added to that,he also tried his best to provide the viewers what's inside the psyche of the man behind the murderer particularly his obsession on J.D. Salinger's novel entitled ""Catcher In The Rye"" especially on its theme about the insincerity and inauthenticity of the adult world in which he found in the ex- Beatle. Lindsay Lohan co-stars in this film written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer that was based on based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones.

Leto did a wonderful job playing as Chapman. The viewer will definitely be impressed with his characterization especially when he impressed upon the person watching this film that he is psychologically impaired especially when Chapman totally assumed Holden Caulfield and the events that are happening in his life towards his assassination of John Lennon as being eerily similar to the events of Salinger's novel. While there is nothing I can say negative about Leto's performance,too bad that the movie was far from interesting and compelling as there parts that were somewhat draggy and boring. Also,we never really fully discover influence and reason behind the psyche of Chapman as we only get to see his acts of lies and deceit only during the last days leading to the death of Lennon.

3465447,5,B001AR60GK,"I just watched 2 movies about the murder of John Lennon, back to back. One was CHAPTER 27, and the other is called THE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON.

CHAPTER 27 is by far, the better of the 2 movies, hands down. Jared Leto gained weight for the role, and really seemed to become Mark David Chapman (Lennon's killer), even down to his slight southern accent and his mannerisms. It covers only the 3 days that Chapman was in NYC right before the murder, and ends shortly after the killing. The movie was just the right length (about 90 minutes), and had me emotionally engaged. The ending scene had me crying, followed by being creeped out (watch it and you'll see what I mean). I found it to be a powerful, well made movie.

THE KILLING OF JOHN LENNON movie, on the other hand, seemed overlong (it's about 2 hours long), disjointed, and elicited no emotional response from me. And that's saying something. If you can't get me to cry over the murder of John Lennon, something is wrong with your movie. The movie starts 3 months before the murder, at Chapman's home in Hawaii, and continues after the murder through his imprisonment and trial. Jonas Ball, as Mark David Chapman, does not seem to embody the character at all. He is thin, looks nothing like him, and does not even attempt a southern accent. He was not believable, and this is the main reason I felt detached from the movie.

In my opinion, if you only watch one of these, go for CHAPTER 27.",1409443200,3,1446,4.46969696969697

Psychological portrayal? Not to me. I thought he was uninteresting and I did not care about why he may have done this awful thing. Pacing back and forth acting crazed waiting on John Lennon to come outside is not interesting to me, my dogs pace. Maybe if they had given a peek into his life more, or even some reasoning however strange it may have been as to why he was so odd, it may have been a great film to me. I have no sympathy for killers, and I do not feel there are real, valid reasons for murder. Otherwise we might see somebody like Anne Frank go crazy and kill.
Honestly we all have some sort of issues from childhood, but few people go through with violent acts. As a whole, we do have plenty of murderous people, but figuring out why they did it after the fact does not seem like a positive thing to me. I feel more good can be done by trying to help before then if at all possible.

If we follow Chapman's logic- yes- John is a phony (becuz he has a lot of money) - and yet
John was NOT a phony- he, of all the Beatles- stood for something!

I sense there is much untold here- that there are issues yet to be probed. I will have to research further- what has Chapman sd- what do the other books say? America does not really want to look at the causes of violence. WHY??

I would like to pin a lot of things on Chapman- anti peace movement- anti gun control- U S imperialism, which would explain John's murder so easily- let's say Chapman was hired by the FBI?!?!?!

and yet- schizophrenia is a so far little understood disease.

By the way- another grreat rock and roll artist- Nilson- became a hard worker for handgun after John's death- and- thank you Nilson!

More controversial subjects than this should be raised- but I praise this film- it is unsettling because it raises some (let's just say) things.

3465470,3,B001AR60GK,"I wanted to watch Chapter 27 because I am a fan of music and love music and wanted to get some sense of how a fan of John Lennon could murder him in cold blood after gaining his autograph just hours before.  I didn't see this film as a vehicle for praising or being sympathetic to Mark David Chapman, although after watching it, I did find that he was portrayed in a sympathetic light in some scenes even if it was unintentional.  I don't understand Mark David Chapman or his motives for killing John Lennon and he doesn't deserve my understanding in my opinion.  But seeing this film gave me a persepctive on how something so chilling and unfathomable could've happened to someone so famous.

Jared Leto did a believable portrayal of the insanity and psychoticness of Mark David Chapman.  It reinforced my feelings of how unsympathetic, calculated and cold Mark David Chapman's motives were for killing John Lennon despite the fact that John Lennon so graciously gave an autograph to the sick, twisted individual who would so soon take his life.  I found it so strange how unguarded John Lennon lived his life and how he would be swarmed by paparazzi in this day and age and would probably not live in a building without a private, gated entrance.  It was amazing to watch the scene where he walks out of the Dakota and there is just one photographer and a handful of fans.  That would never happen today with society's obsession with celebrity.

I don't think of this film as a validation or recognition of Mark David Chapman as some kind of victim to mental illness.  I see this film as a testament to why this man should be kept in prison for his entire life with no parole.  I was astounded to even think he was up for parole just because he is a born again Christian?  He killed a man in cold blood and it was calculated when you shoot someone in the back 5 times.  I don't know the historical facts surrounding John Lennon's death but I do know this film reinforces my feeling that someone like Mark David Chapman needs to stay in prison to pay for his crime and not to forget the sheer evil that can evolve in a person's heart to commit such an atrocious act of violence against another human being.",1254700800,11,2207,4.473815461346633
3465471,5,B001AR60GK,"This movie shows you exactly why Chapman was so sick in what he did- he wasn't right in the head from the get go.  I kind of figured that much going into the film, but watching the story unfold and the tense moments build and build, you can see Chapman would succeed in his sick little goal.

One thing that surprised me is that Chapman kept waiting outside the hotel where Lennon was staying hoping to, in his words, get to meet John Lennon.  Of course nobody knew what he meant exactly when he said he wanted to meet Lennon- the people around him just thought he was a quiet guy who was a huge fan.

I wasn't aware he kept trying to get close to this photographer that was waiting to snap some photos of Lennon.  Chapman and the photographer kept talking, and there was even a point when Chapman wouldn't leave the poor guy alone, even following him down the street when the photographer clearly had enough of Chapman's odd, demanding ways.

I didn't know Chapman actually met Lennon's little boy the day before he went crazy outside the park area of the hotel.  I WAS aware Lennon gave Chapman an autograph just a brief time before Chapman would give everyone the worst surprise ever.

That horrible scream by Yoko Ono the moment Lennon was shot and killed... that's a moment that nearly made me cry myself because you can feel the honest emotions in the movie, and I can only guess that's how it really happened.  Such a horrible incident involving one of my favorite musicians.

You get a real good idea what kind of sick person Chapman was while the story develops, and he meets people around the city.  What appeared to most people to just be Chapman as a quiet strange guy, quickly changed into something else- a monster.

The whole movie is seen from the point of view of Chapman's life the moment he arrives to New York City.  This movie does a fine job clearing up exactly what happened the night Lennon was killed.  I wish the incident never happened of course, but this movie shows us what it's like seeing a crazy man think carefully about what he was planning to do, and actually carrying out his sick plan.",1248652800,,2122,4.449612403100775
3465472,3,B001AR60GK,"My family's satellite provider gave us a free preview of a movie channel in hopes that we would subscribe. We watched Chapter 27 one afternoon when we had nothing else to do. Chapter 27 is not bad, but it is not a ""must-see"" film by any means.

The best thing about the film, by far, is Jared Leto's performance as Mark David Chapman. Leto's physical resemblance to Chapman is uncanny. Leto is often the sole character on screen and he does a good job of ""carrying"" the film. He is particularly strong in the scene in which Chapman hires a prostitute; in a few short minutes Leto subtly conveys Chapman's awkwardness, alienation, and madness. There are several other scenes that overtly establish Chapman's character, but none has the punch of that scene.

The sole slip in Leto's performance is his attempt at a Southern accent. To a Southerner's ear, he just does not pull it off very well. (In fact, Leto mutters and sounds as though he took too much Xanax; too often, he ""talks... like... this..."")

The rest of the cast is largely wasted. Lindsay Lohan is not bad as Jude, but she is given absolutely nothing worthwhile to do. The only standout in the supporting cast is Judah Friedlander. Friedlander plays Paul, an aspiring paparazzi, who frequents the Dakota (Lennon's apartment building) in order to get photos that he can sell. Paul is memorable, even though he is on screen for just a few minutes.

I also think that the filmmakers deserve credit for some excellent visuals and music. There are some great, colorful exteriors of Manhattan. The interiors tend, on the other hand, to be stark. I suppose the interiors are supposed to suggest Chapman's bleak mental state, but some of them are so dark that the film is difficult to see. Today's cinematographers all seem to think that a film has more artistic merit if the screen is so dark that the viewer has trouble understanding what is happening.

At best, Chapter 27 is a guilty pleasure. The film is about Chapman, period; it does not examine the effects of Chapman's violence and that is inexcusable. I think, moreover, that Chapman isn't interesting enough to sustain interest over the film's 90 minutes. Chapter 27 inadvertently provides a ""nobody"" killer (Chapman) with the notoriety that he sought by murdering a celebrity. At worst, Chapter 27 is yet another entry in a long line of movies that celebrate mental illness and graphic violence.

Chapter 27 is not a bad film to watch if you are bored and have nothing else to do. I would not, however, recommend that anyone seek it out.",1248307200,2,2554,4.740990990990991

The director/writer never convinced me that I should unless the allusions to catcher in the rye was all he had up his sleeve???",1244332800,4,452,4.524390243902439
3465474,1,B001AR60GK,"The nobody who murdered John Lennon did so in order to be somebody. To exact some recognition out of the victim's celebrity. To be remembered as ""the man who shot John Lennon"" rather than not remembered at all. Maybe to have a movie made after him someday -who knows; even to cash some royalties from it, perhaps...

If you buy this movie -if you pay for the guy's motive- you're not only rewarding his crime, you are encouraging the next. Think about it.",1234742400,5,455,4.481927710843373
3465475,5,B001AR60GK,"this movie had me from the opening lines, delivered in jared leto (as mark david chapman)'s hushed, disconnected, lilting whisper ""i knew what i had to do. i knew i had to  kill john lennon."" fanacticaclly taken  with the  salinger novel ""catcher in the rye"" and relating easily to holden caulfield, the book's own severely emotionally disturbed main character, chapman easily relates to the protagonist of the famous counter-culture novel's  pathological hatred of ""phonies."" chapman's obsession with eliminating lennon as the embodiment of all things false and pretentious is thus cautiously explained. we are not meant to FORGIVE it, we are meant to UNDERSTAND it. ""it"" being the outgrowth of an increasingly paranoid and depressed man's unraveling mental condition.

jared leto's transformation from hollywood pin-up boy to hulking, suspicious, ungainly , overweight and morbidly withdrawn and socially estranged  chapman  is nothing short of revolutionary. i have never seen an actor make more of a stunning commitment to such an unsympathetic character  and display such a complete lack of vanity. it truly is his ""raging bull"" and he is perfect in the role.

lindsay lohan and judah freidlander are compelling in their brief ammount of time onscreen as, respectively, fellow lennon-stalkers, though of the more benign variety, one a lovestruck super fan, the other a street-savvy, no-nonsense ambitious  photographer. lohan displays  a delicate edginess amidst her character's sweetly winsome  nature, and as she gets to know chapman the nervousness and discomfort she begins to feel as he displays his increasingly more and more abnormal behavior becomes slowly palpable. she is a lovely and talented actress, no matter what her tabloid reputation may be. friendlander has an even briefer part but is effective as a vaguely suspicious photographer who actually takes a picture of chapman with lennon the first time they met, in which he heart-achingly reveals, through the interior monologue that is heard throughout the film, that he, at that instance, is startled to discover lennon is in fact, much to his astonishment, not a  despicable ""phony"" at all, but is indeed quite humble, kind, and polite.  we hear him struggle to figure out what to do...

 but we are shown that he has felt like a failure all his life, and that this is the one thing he MUST ""succeed"" at, that he believes this will be his mark on humanity, this cruel act is somehow his destiny, given to him by his disturbed mind and obsessive mistaken interpretations of the novels and books which seem to be his sole comfort. perhaps  it is also  implied chapman follows through  with his horrid, despicable crime  only b/c that is merely ""the plan"" and as an army man he has spent a significant portion of his adult life following orders and seeing to plans -- you don't quit  no matter WHAT, whatever  you start, no matter even if you have a change of heart, you finish it, or fail once more.  it's almost as if lennon's murder will, in a sick way, provide him with the redemption the formerly  devout believer found  christ could not. as chapman makes these bizarre interpretations of the bible and how it and ""catcher"" speak to him;  how he analyzes random coincidences occurring outside the famous dakota building he shot him in front of, in those fateful weeks, to have deeper, more significant meaning (magical thinking) is also apparent. this  inner dialogue is so warped and paranoid, so sadly  macabre  twisted and macabre one cannot help but infer that it is the rambling self-persecution of a tormented individual, suffering most likely from an intensive  schizophrenic and delusional state.  again, leno's performance cannot be understated in it's effectiveness at doing this, it is a remarkable achievement. his is almost the ONLY voice we hear throughout the movie. it is not that he creates sympathy for the character, it is more that he, most remarkably, allows us to see how this man's senseless act MADE SENSE TO HIM.  how the immorality of it all paled in comparison to what chapman thought was the bigger outrage and hypocrisy of celebrity worship replacing ""true"" deity worship, and the likely bitter anger, resentment, and jealousy  he, as a depressed unhappy, socially ostracized  failure felt towards a man whom he did not have a relationship with beyond that of being, at one time, a  self-described huge fan .

this is a difficult film to watch, it is about a subject which struck horror in the hearts of many of us who loved the Beatles and john lennon's music and will never forget that awful day. but it is an important movie to see, and the viewer will walk away with a deeper understanding on mental illness, those whom it affects and it's impact on society as a whole, even years after it's most vicious feared outcome and scenario takes place. you can't defend the indefensible, but you can understand and have knowledge of how the indefensible occurs, and why the undefendable allow it to.",1232668800,3,5001,4.975932611311673

I wish the movie had gone more into that, but other than that Jared Leto, as always, was phenomenal! from music to acting there is *nothing* this man cannot do.

8278979,3,B001AR60GK,"Leto is phenomenal as Chapman and portrays his descent into homicidal madness quite accurately. However, the film as a story fails. The writing is good, but there isn't enough material for a feature-length film. I was bored at times. Felt more like a documentary with re-enactments than a fully rounded story. Certain characters were irrelevant...Lindsay Lohan, the prostitute, others. Seemed like they didn't have enough to work with so they stretched the concept to make ends meet. Still, Leto saves it from being a disaster. A solid three stars.",1517875200,,548,5.168539325842697

8278981,4,B001AR60GK,"To me, its rather morbid, and a little creepy, that there are two bio-pics about Mark Chapman and his murder of John Lennon.  At 86 minutes long, this particular telling focuses on the three days that Chapman was in New York to shot Lennon.

Jared Leto is outstanding as he portrays Chapman. He makes for a convincing person tormented in his mind. His performance is full of nuances and other subtleties that makes us aware his character is at the edge and might, or might not, go over at any minute.  The plot sticks close the historical timeline of Chapmans days in New York. The shooting of Lennon is never directly shown and in no way is gratuitous.

This version of the Chapman/Lennon story almost has an indie feel, which seems appropriate. It had a  good production value, but not over the top. Related, I don't remember hearing any Lennon or Beatles music. Could have been a budget concern; Im guessing it cost quite a bit to license songs from those catalogs. It was well cast, except for the inclusion of Lindsay Lohan. Shes more than a capable actress, but every time I saw her in a scene I got distracted thinking about all the drama in her life! Her role might have been better given to a unknown, or up-and-comer.

Regardless of the pros and cons of this film, or whether some see it as good or bad, its a reminder that several lives were changed forever on that fatal day. This is not a typical Hollywood movie . . . there was no happy ending.",1516060800,,1458,4.441947565543071

Leto becomes Chapman in this film, both visually but, especially, through his eerie voiceover that at once connects with and unspools his protagonist. More than anything this voiceover reveals Chapman battling with his split personality, one part trying to tell him to go back to Hawaii with his autographed copy of ""Double Fantasy,"" another part convincing him he is Holden Caulfield and must kill Lennon for having joined the ""phonies."" This merciless film adds another chapter to why America needs to address both the collapse of its mental health system and its easy availability of firearms. No one here is saved.
