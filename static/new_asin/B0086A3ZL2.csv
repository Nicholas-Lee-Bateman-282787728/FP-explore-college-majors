5134936,3,B0086A3ZL2,"After directing two POW thrillers ""[REC]"" and its sequel, a director team Jaume Balaguer and Paco Plaza took separate paths. While Paco Plaza went on to direct another sequel to the ""[REC]"" franchise alone, Jaume Balaguer chose to direct ""Sleep Tight"" (""Mientras duermes""), a thriller whose success with audiences may depend on how much they can suspend their disbelief.

""Sleep Tight"" centers on Csar (Luis Tosar), a quiet Barcelona apartment building concierge with a secret. Without giving away much about the film's convoluted storyline, he is interested in one resident, ever-cheerful Clara (Marta Etura). Also, another resident seems to know something about his ""secret.""

As the story slowly unfolds, you will know more about Csar, who finds his meaning of life in something that most people would deem as unusual or unhealthy. Perhaps some viewers may find the central character Csar intriguing, while others notice in him an all-too-familiar narrative pattern, in which our protagonist greatly benefits from lucky coincidences and other supporting characters' incredibly stupid decisions.

It is true, as some critics point out, that the film is free from familiar thriller conventions, but Balaguer actually borrows its key ideas from other thrillers: one from Hitchcock and one from Almodvar. Not that ""Sleep Tight"" is a rip-off, as it has a few unique aspects, especially its ending. Still, as far as characters go, Balaguer's are disappointingly flat, in spite of Luis Tosar's effective performance.

So is it worth watching? It depends. Maybe once. Not a bad thriller though with characters that we do not care much it fails to leave much impact.",1358121600,3,1660,5.300380228136882
5134937,5,B0086A3ZL2,"Sleep Tight is a foreign film i know most people haven't heard about unless you live in Spain of course, it barely got a release in America but now it's out on blu-ray and digital and is definitely a must watch. First thing though if you hate subtitles walk away because watching it with dubbed voices is criminal. Anyway the movie comes from the director of [REC] 1&2 and is his best film yet, sleep tight takes place almost exclusively inside a small apartment complex and tells the story of Caesar the complexes lobby and maintenance worker and his fascination  with the tenant Clara and how she's always happy. I won't go any further with plot points as doing so will ruin it but the movie makes you think about how you trust someone yet that person can be just plain evil. The concept is very dark and surprisingly original and bolstered by fantastic performances, beautiful direction and writing with gorgeous cinematography and editing. A must rent or buy in my opinion. But fair warning this movie is done in a very intense Slow-Burn style so the movie moves at a slower pace.",1357862400,18,1084,4.616580310880829
5134938,5,B0086A3ZL2,brilliant thriller and extremely realistic. 2 scenes stand out as being very effective. when he talks miss veronica into a depression and clara's Bf's murder...i feel like i have to check IMDB to make sure that actor is still alive. its the most realistic murder i've ever seen in a film. its subtitled but simplified so its not too distracting. sick stuff!!,1357776000,,358,4.790322580645161
5134939,5,B0086A3ZL2,"This movie starts off ordinarily enough, and then sucks you right in! How anyone can be as despicable as the main character is beyond my imagination. I love the way they established the setting and the characters from the beginning. From then on it gets worse, with every scenario worse than the preceding one.  The main character is relentless and I love the actor playing him. This is what thrillers are made of! I can't wait to purchase the DVD.",1356825600,8,448,4.6
5134940,4,B0086A3ZL2,This movie is going to make my Top 10 List for 2012. Very engrossing...reminds me of Hitchock style of movie.,1356480000,,109,4.5
5134941,3,B0086A3ZL2,"Creepy but slow moving thriller about a seemingly convivial doorman at a high rise building who harbors a seething hatred for anyone who is happy, since he is unable to experience happiness himself.  To reveal more would undermine the slow-burn narrative that reveals information at its own very leisurely pace--you don't even really know what the main character is up to until fairly far into the movie.  This was relatively creepy but I liked it the least of any of writer/director Juame Balaguero's movies to date--it's simply much more slow and less scary than anything else he has made so far and the cat and mouse game between the main character and his victim is so completely one-sided that I found myself starting to lose interest after a while.  This is apparently intended to be more cerebral than Balaguero's previous thrillers.  The ending is certainly interesting to ponder after, but like much of the movie it doesn't have much impact while you're actually watching.  Sleep Tight is only intermittantly suspenseful and the movie's single-minded focus on its psychotic main character becomes a bit numbing after a while.  Even after the movie is over you end up knowing very little about him--he ends up being someone you don't want to ever cross paths with, but little more.",1343260800,6,1289,4.944444444444445
5134942,5,B0086A3ZL2,"This film is an absolute must see.
Fantastic suspense/horror thriller by acclaimed Spanish director Jaume Balaguero who was also responsible for ""Fragile"" and the ""Rec."" films.
This is tremendously suspenseful with believable characters and excellent acting.
The central character is a person who cannot experience happiness which frustrates him so much that he will go to any lengths to destroy others' pleasure.
This film is so good you should kill to see it !!",1342137600,3,463,5.27027027027027
5134943,4,B0086A3ZL2,Good movie. Good acting. Very creepy concept and my only complaint would be that I think it was slightly longer than it needed to be. But overall the movie kept my attention and I was eager to see how it ended.,1520985600,,210,4.146341463414634
5134944,1,B0086A3ZL2,What a waste of my time. The bad guy won in the end. It is incredibly implausible for the villain to get away with all that he did. Definitely one of the worst movies I have watched.,1520640000,2,182,3.945945945945946
5134945,3,B0086A3ZL2,"Painfully slow at times, this movie does have a certain creep factor that goaded me into watching the entire thing.

Cesar is obsessed with a young, attractive tenant and stalks her to harass her and basically destroy her happiness in life in every malicious way you can imagine.

5134950,4,B0086A3ZL2,We decided to watch this on a whim and were so surprised how compelling it was. Started out a little slow but once the creepiness started it didn't stop.  Subtitles lagged for us and I felt behind a lot of the time.,1517011200,,215,4.119047619047619

5134953,4,B0086A3ZL2,"Wow!  My skin is crawling.  I'm thinking back on all of the building supers that I've know. Thank goodness they were normal human beings. A couple of reviewers said they didn't quite believe that all of this could happen to Clara and she not know something is going on. I have to agree with that, so that's why I gave a 4 rating.  I have seen Luis Tosar in several other films and enjoyed his acting. This character is very different from others he has played. Can't imagine that I would be sleeping well tonight if I lived in an apartment building. On this occasion, I'm glad to be alone in my own place. If you like suspenseful movies I think you will like this. After thought: the young girl is about a creepy as he is, Glad it turned out the way it did for her.",1516406400,3,765,4.190476190476191

5134963,3,B0086A3ZL2,"This is an effective thriller which, unfortunately, goes over the top until there's little credibility left in the plot. My biggest problem was with the subtitles though. No, I have no trouble reading and watching as many amateur critics complain. ""Not in English!"", read a one-star review by some genius. I would be horrified for the lines to be dubbed in English. Is that what these whiners want? Back to my complaint. The subtitles were constantly out of sync with the voices and would tend to appear about 2 seconds late. When the conversations started going back and forth I would get to the point where I had to try to figure out who spoke which line.

About having a purpose in life.  About love.  And how the worst monsters are OURSELVES.  I am in shock right now,  and was riveted throughout.  It is a thriller,  as well as a study of the human psyche.  It reminds me of a Kafka short story or Edgar Allan Poe or some of the greats.  Whoa mama.",1508544000,2,454,4.151162790697675

5134968,3,B0086A3ZL2,"I did not watch this movie in its entirety. I jumped through it a couple of times just to get to the point because Caesar had me pissed. Caesar is the loon who worked as a front desk clerk. I could not figure out if he and the young lady he drugged(chloroform), tormented and ultimately raped were once in a relationship and broke up or if he was just out of his effin mind and chose her to unleash his evil acts. It honestly appears to be the latter which begs me to question why. Why her?

He is a vile individual and for me, this was just very difficult to watch. It was not implied that he was having sex with her until towards the end, but she was clearly having sex with her boyfriend... The ending was devastating in its own right and because of that, this movie gains a 3 star from me.",1507507200,,793,4.083333333333333

It is a creepy flick and a subject matter that some may find distasteful but if get past that then its a pretty enjoyable movie with the usual plot flaws that are easily overlooked. Its not a long movies and I doubt shortening it would have made a difference so stay with it for a nice little ending. This movie is getting dings and the delayed sub-titles and not to split hairs there weren't any in what we just watched and closed captioning is not the same thing.",1505520000,2,792,4.431506849315069

The concept is horrifying, yet somehow I was left with a nasty feeling about it -- as though I were the one being toyed with. I really wanted to like it more. Maybe it was successful in that I was left with this distaste, so I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars. It's worth a watch if you like this genre.

5135002,1,B0086A3ZL2,"A truly vile entry into the regrettable Torture Porn sub-genre, which despite anti-Eli Roth fanatics, does not include the Hostel Series or the Saw Franchise. Screenwriter Alberto Marini and horror director Jaume Balaguer&oacute; ([REC] 1-4), know exactly what psychological-gender screws they are turning, which props and pieces of furniture to foreground to create claustrophobia (again, [REC]), and seem to delight in the lightless representation of pure evil-- a sociopathic apartment manager who comes to create his masterpiece-- the total, barbaric and all-consuming destruction of a young woman simply because she is ""too happy.""

So far, so good. And as an inclusive fan of the blackest of the black comedies (from 1979's The Tin Drum to 2014's Horns) I was hooked into the foreboding potential of the plot by villainous actor Luis Tosar, who simply oozes malevolence as the manager, completing his daily rounds of despair with the focus of a dung beetle. But then an awful realization begins to creep into view (it hits the audience faster than the intended victim, who smiles through the pain without comprehension): that this is ALL there is, just this dung beetle rolling his ball of excrement around, smearing people with feces. There is no subtext, no metaphor, no fleshed out characters, no reason and no rhyme, and although that could be called a type of textual analysis of evil, it skips the discipline of analysis and reductively revels in the sickness, the result of which is to ensconce the audience into the perpetrator's mind, forcing us to dehumanize all the characters he comes in contact with, just as he does.

This POV is only effective insofar as it is used sparingly, otherwise, what is the point, other than degradation? Even the identically plotted Korean brawler, Handphone (2009), manages to compel audience engagement with a cast of completely unlikable characters, because motivations are explored within the larger context of a consumeristic cultural.

5135009,4,B0086A3ZL2,"This has a good black comedic/creepy idea  the story of a seemingly quiet concierge in an upscale apartment building who is actually an angry, rather insane depressive who loves to quietly screw with peoples lives and try to make them as miserable as he is.  He meets his match in the seemingly always upbeat Mimi, a sexy young woman who lives in the building who literally dances alone around her apartment to peppy music every morning.

Cesar, the super, gets ever more complex and outlandish in his increasingly dangerous attempts at bringing some rain into Mimis life.  But more often than not his plots backfire on him, adding a sort of grown-up Roadrunner/Coyote humor to the very creepy creepiness.

Sadly, and I guess inevitably it grows more serious, more repetitive, more predictable, less logical, less thematic and less fun as it goes along, until I was finally just waiting for it to play out its familiar horror/thriller tropes and end.  However, a well handled last twist won me part way back.  But not quite far enough to want to revisit this",1484092800,2,1058,4.8121546961325965

I felt no sympathy for his ailing mom, after all, she spawned the monster and had a hand in his upbringing.

5135031,4,B0086A3ZL2,"For most people, it's hard to fathom how anyone could delight in making others miserable. Sleep Tight is one of those films that will have you swearing on your life that you'll NEVER meet a human terror like the one you'll be exposed to. No shots are wasted in presenting such a disturbing plot for your insatiable voyeuristic enjoyment. This is the kind of thriller ripe with unnerving suspense that commands your full attention. What catapults this movie into purely unsettling territory is the simple naivet&eacute; of the protagonist. Can anyone be so trusting, so unsuspecting? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. Sleep Tight may even be a lesson to the viewer who thinks he/she knows somebody solely based on a short-time, or long-time acquaintance. A smile can conceal chasms of darkness.

If you enjoy this movie, I recommend two others:
""The Making of a Lady"", a British production set in the Victorian era. The plot is overly contrived (in the best fictional way, of course), but equally entertaining.
""Take My Eyes"" (or, ""Te doy mis ojos""), another Spanish production featuring the all-too-believable acting of Luis Tosar in the role of a domestic abuser. Even though domestic abuse is almost too ugly a topic for a film, this is the best depiction I have ever seen.

The only two people who know about Cesar's evil side are the building manager who is looking for a way to fire him, and a young curious girl who watches Cesar sneak into Clara's apartment every night.

Story, as viewers probably already have read, centers on a intelligent but highly disturbed condo complex doorman, fixer-upper, greeter, what ever task dwellers ask of him. He lives alone in the basement, has had problems keeping similar jobs in the past and has some serious anger self-esteem issues. Also has a semi-aware yet comatose hospitalized mom with whom he has mommy issues with and in whom he confides his evil intentions just to torment her and be the vehicle by which the audience learns his true nature. But, three stars for too many holes in the story such as his background with his mom; how he became so creepy; how he was able to pull so much off, so many times, without being caught, especially when the police fail with what little they know about forensics in solving a death in the building and other investigations; finally, the ending which was clever but not believable.

The shots narrate the closeness and invasion that Cesar has inhabited in her life, as we see him hiding under her bed, as he waits patiently for her to fall into a peaceful sleep. The acting is superb, Cesar is chilling and believable as the lonely and perverted concierge.
The film creates great unease in the audience as we question the safety of our own homes, and how easy it would be for someone to intrude on our lives in a similar way.

This is a story of mental violence created through the control over another human being, as another plays God, resulting in a situation and environment that is inescapable by the victim.

5135048,3,B0086A3ZL2,"Sleep tight is a film which about invasion of privacy, sadism and relies on a very slow start and an abrupt end which poses more questions than answers. However it is still an interesting story about the darkness of the human mind.
Luis Tovar is Cesar, a concierge at a building in Barcelona. The opening scene shows him as he wakes up before his girlfriend Clara ( Marta Etura) and leaves the apartment to takes his position on the front desk. Soon after we find Clara, when she leaves the lobby, she says hello to him but only in a formal way.
Later we find that Clara does not know that he uses his building keys to enter her apartment to sleep with her every night after knocking her off with chloroform. He wants to slowly wreck her life because he can only be happy when he has wiped off the smile of her face. He also violates her physically which results in a shocking result.
This is a very slow film about one man's perverted pursuit to bring total ruination to a happy person. The director does create a sense of tension in just about every frame, but then how could there be not any tension created by the fact that someone is sleeping in someone's house without their knowledge?. Audiences are led to enjoy this depth of human perversion because the story is unique and backed by terrific acting. Three stars. 3/10/13",1365984000,2,1330,4.454918032786885

Directed by Jaume Balaguer, who has already made three of my favourite horror films - REC, REC 2 and THE NAMELESS (the actor who plays the Dachau survivor in THE NAMELESS, a film adapted from the Ramsey Campbell novel of the same title, is in this too). It's a film that rubbed one of my raw nerves for about two thirds of the 90 minute duration and made me squirm. A compelling story of how exclusion, disappointment and obsession work in the mind. A quieter, lo-fi SNOWTOWN in some respects and has one of those great scripts that makes me wish it was based on a novel I could now read.",1361577600,3,695,4.480314960629921

See, a guy like me, pirate verions actually helps me buying new movies that that is also helpful for film production companies because after watching it, if I like it, I buy it for sure. If there were no pirate version, I would have never known this kinda movie.
This one was surprisingly simple but fun to watch.

The director made a very well made zombie movie called REC before so I would say I expected quite much watching this one.
The movie was solid and well made.
The charactors are all good but most of all my surprise was because the main actor didn't showed a lot of emotions through his face but I still could felt how he feels clearly.

It's a thriller like 'Pacific Heights' kida movie. The difference is that the man who loves a woman decides to destroy her smile.

He is also being blackmailed by a young girl (Iris Almeida) who espies him coming out of Clara's room (Marta Etura).

The film is not overly graphic and goes easy on the ""perv"" factor. You are drawn into the film to see how far Cesar will go to make everyone miserable. It is a well done production, unlike so many ""B"" films in this genre.

The film lacks any real good ""B"" horror. At the same time it is a ""B"" movie subject. I would imagine the niche is narrow for a fan base in this slow moving tale.
