7741442,3,B01EYY127M,"At just under $9, this double bill blu is certainly worth it for Bill Castle fans. The images on both features are very nice looking and the sound sounds about as good as it ever will.

13 Ghosts includes Illusion-o! with the William Castle segments. The Illusion-o! works well with the red and blue filters, if you have them (if not, standard anaglyph in glasses will do). This release does not include them in the package. Also, the parts of the film that have ""Use Viewer"" and ""Remove Viewer"" have been removed and replaced with a fade in and out. That's rather sad, since it's a vital part of the experience. Otherwise, it's a nice upgrade from the DVD. The color sequences with garish reds and blues are startling when juxtaposed against the lovely black and white photography. The sound is as flat as it ever was. But this is matinee fodder we're talking about here.

13 Frightened Girls also looks very nice for being the matinee programmer that it is. Strange that it would be paired with 13 Ghosts considering the number 13 is the only thing the two films have remotely in common. The Pathecolor really pops! The sound is flat mono. The gimmick this time? Nothing in the film for the audience to play with. There was a promotion during the making that searched for one girl, each from a different country, picked to represent their country in the film. None of these girls are given anything interesting to do here. The onscreen title is 13 Frightened Girls and not The Candy Web, as it was shown in England on some American television broadcasts. Sadly, the print here doesn't contain Castle's onscreen appearance, urging the audience to pick up their souvenir card on the way out.

Overall, a very nice looking, but completely bare bones release from Mill Creek. A must for Castle fanatics.",1469491200,13,1801,4.6750788643533125
7741443,5,B01EYY127M,"I love it BUT - WILL THE GHOST VIEWER WORK ? Don't buy unless you sure!

So far there has been only one past release that made the Ghost Viewer work. Those old enough to remember the cardboard ""Viewer"" with the Red & Blue cellophane glued in a rectangle, one above the other. If you looked through the blue section, you would be spared the ""Shock"" of NOT seeing the ghosts, only the actors reacting to the Ghost. If you were brave enough look through the Red section to see the ghosts AND the actors. What Fun! the "" Illusion-O"" gimmick was wildly poplar back when the movie first came out.

The first collection of William Castle's movies HAD a working "" Illusion-O"". I think I remember one side of the disk had "" Illusion-O"" and the other side did not. All other releases did NOT have it. Only the first collection. I believe the set had five movies in it? Hard to find it took months of searching. worth looking for it. I DO HOPE THIS RELEASE WILL INCLUDE IT, ALTHOUGH IT IS UNLIKELY SINCE EARLIER RELEASES CHOOSE NOT TO PRESENT IT IN THE ORIGINAL . HUMMMMMMM. . . .Look for a young Martin Milliner (Route 66 & Adam 12 fame) and Margret Hamilton (The witch from Wizard of Oz)",1464048000,19,1178,4.32579185520362

No ""ghost viewer"" come with the movie,BUT ......... Red & Blue 3-D glassed work just fine!!!! Look through one lens to see the ghosts or the other lens to ""not"" see the ghosts! Very Camp 60's fun! Remember, only use the colored lenses when the person in the movie puts on their glasses!!!

8759820,4,B01EYY127M,"This is the 1960 original ""13 Ghosts"" with a process called Illusion-O by filmmaker William Castle.

Prior to this film,
1. Castle had the gimmick of a life insurance policy if you died while watching 1958's ""Macabre.""
2. He followed that with the gimmick of Emergo in the 1959 original ""House on Haunted Hill"" (starring Vincent Price)
with a skeleton emerging from the screen and into the theater audience.
3. Again in 1959 and again with Vincent Price, Castle released his multi-gimmick film, ""The Tingler.""
This one had a black & white scene with red color blood plus motors under seats in some theaters that goosed the
patron sitting there when the Tingler was supposedly loose in the theater.

Some people erroneously assume that ""13 Ghosts"" was in a primitive Anaglyph (red/blue) 3D, but that is not true.

The red & blue glasses for ""13 Ghosts"" is so that in certain tinted scenes
(a) you could choose to see the ghosts by looking through the red viewer,
or
(b) you could choose to not see the ghosts by looking through the blue viewer.

It is a cool trick and it works perfect on this Blu-ray transfer.
Unfortunately, you have to have your own red/blue glasses as none are provided,
but
they are easy to find online
(if you do not have any lying around as they are like those that you use to view 3D comic books).

But do get those cheap red/blue cardboard glasses !

The online reviews have underrated the really good, sharp, and detailed image on this film. It looks top notch.

The film transfer is supported on this Blu-ray disc by a high data rate, aka bit rate --
This very desirable high bit rate for ""13 Ghosts"" is surprising
in that Mill Creek recently releaed 4 Hammer Horror Films with an unsatisfactory low bit rate.
Why?

As to the second feature, ""13 Frightened Girls,"" the color looks perfect, but the transfer looks like heavy use of DNR
(digital noise reduction) and as if the detail has been scrubbed away. Sad, but the movie is really poor anyway.

Buy this 2 disc set for ""13 Ghosts"" and forget the second feature.

The Illusion-O gimmick here is a one-of-a-kind experience,
and
coupled with a fun story (featuring that classic ""Wizard of Oz"" Witch, Margaret Hamilton) this is worth having a copy.",1476144000,5,2225,4.624365482233503
8759821,5,B01EYY127M,"This Blu-ray disc contains two of William Castle's great films, 13 ghosts. and 13 frightened girls all on 1 disc. I can recommend both films as the fist was one that used a difficult process to actually show you the ghosts, and made it all seem plausible. The second film in this collection was very entertaining as the movie tells the tale of schoolgirls caught in the spy business. Using the location of Switzerland, and a prep school for diplomat's children, the story is unexpectedly good and funny at the same time. See for yourself when you get this Blu-ray disc.",1474156800,2,569,4.643564356435643
