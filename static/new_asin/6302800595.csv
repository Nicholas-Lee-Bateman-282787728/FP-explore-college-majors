513868,3,6302800595,"Let me start by saying I think Daniel Day-Lewis if the finest actor living today.  He is arguably the finest film actor ever.  If you are a devoted fan, this is worth the money and effort to obtain.  It is fascinating to see this in-control, always so exacting actor playing, there's no other word for it, goofy.  He's manic and you can catch a glimpse of what a genius he could prove to be in a comedy.  Just a glimpse, because the movie itself is horrendous.  The main idea is good - a fish-out-of-water story about a New York/British art dealer sent to Georgia to obtain a rare painting - and there is a potential when it comes to the talent of the other cast members.  But in the end it's not a very good movie.",1294444800,,715,4.213235294117647
513869,4,6302800595,"I always wanted to see this movie because it was filmed at the historical Kollock house that is just a few miles from my home. It has it's funny moments and is a nice story. Wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but I'd watch it again.",1280361600,,239,3.8979591836734695
513870,3,6302800595,"Yeah, I know that the critics hated it, and I can sometimes find reasons to agree with their assesments.  But, I am mysteriously drawn to this farce.  The  notion of mixing Renoir, New York City ""artworld"" sophistication, the ""new"" South and the old, spiced with as many stereotypical characters as possible takes theatre of absurdity into an uncharted territory. I love how over the top are the characters; how the plot while seemingly a series of unconnected events manages to collect itself, and how the resolution is somewhat surprising.

No S&B is not a great film, maybe not even a good one, but it has the appeal of a cult film that make me want to watch it again to try and figure out what the film maker is trying to tell me.  On the way I discover another joke that I have missed, or I laugh again at the familiar ones.  I have recommended this film to many, some of which laugh with me, and others who shake their heads and walk away.  Enjoy it if you are able.",1213315200,3,972,4.366666666666666
513871,4,6302800595,"I saw this movie in the early '90's when independent and foreign films were still independent in the real sense. At this point, I had only seen Daniel Day-Lewis in Room With A View, so this movie was a significant departure from that. It is a fish-out-of-water comedic film. A Britsh art-dealer living in New York (and dating the boss's daughter) is sent to the South to collect a valuable painting from the estate of an eccentric Southern gentleman. Along the way, he encounters the woman of his dreams and the man's wacky family. High jinks ensue.
  I really liked it. The casting was genius: Laurie Metcalf, Glenne Headley, Joan Cusack, Maury Chaykin, Will Patton, and many others. While funny and strange with a touch of Southern gothic, the film also questions the real value of American success. A good companion film would be Shy People with Barbara Hershey.",1087516800,10,865,4.798657718120805
513872,4,6302800595,"My father's from GA, my husband's from England & we've both lived in/near NYC. So this film hit us where we've lived. Having seen ""In the name of the Father"" & ""Gangs of NY"" we couldn't imagine Day-Lewis in a comedic role but he was brilliant. His physical shtick was prime: absurd canoe rowing at the Atlanta hotel & especially his nude escape from bad guys who were also after the priceless Renoir. Jogging down the NYC streets in a cardboard box, he was rippingly funny. The ever-wonderful Harry Dean Stanton was perfect as the ""Big Daddy"" of a completely dilapidated Southern Mansion. All the minor characters did great jobs of work, especially the trailer wife (not sure of actress's name). We could've done w/ more of Joan Cusak & her bright comedic heart but truly this film is FOUR & 1/2 Stars! ...",1044316800,7,806,4.604166666666667

7831503,4,6302800595,"The plot is a little odd and overly-contrived, but overall I very much enjoyed this weird film full of odd, nerdy humor and crazy characters. I had never seen Daniel Day-Lewis do anything even mildly comedic, and frankly I found this role endearing and adorable. I wish he had done more humorous roles, because he had me rolling with his awkward dorkiness and hilarious facial expressions. This will probably be my new go-to movie when I need a good laugh.",1509494400,,456,4.7125

7831509,2,6302800595,"It's not very funny. The script isn't funny. The situation isn't funny. The actors can't salvage it -- and this has got a pretty good cast. Probably the worst movie Daniel Day-Lewis was ever in. Amazon ought to pay people to watch this movie, not charge them for it.",1376179200,,266,4.448979591836735

7831511,5,6302800595,"When upper crust Brittish arts dealer meets backwoods Georgia misfits, there are some scenes that will literally have you rolling on the floor.  Admittedly, some slapstick and crude humor, but terrific acting pulls off some serious comedy.  I've purchased it for several friends and family and everyone loves it. 'Course ya gotta be able to appreciate humor.",1358553600,,358,5.2631578947368425
