8541815,5,B009IF12XW,"This is a great biography of a wonderful composer almost unknown in the United States, suspiciously so. I so much admired this elegant little speech of Mr. Shchedrin that I took the time to write it down:  ""Originally, music was created by our God to help us approach other people. Music is the only language which connects us with heaven; with spring, autumn, winter, summer; with the wind, the sun, the moon. The ability to put all this into words was, of course, given to the great philosophers and poets, but those who came closest to the truth were the eminent musicians, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky... That's why I've always been convinced that this original trait of the art of music must not be lost.""",1526774400,,718,4.744

I regret that at this time there are no dvds available of most of the works from which  we see and hear excerpts . It was a pleasure to see the fine pianist-conductor Pletnev .",1381968000,,278,4.346153846153846
