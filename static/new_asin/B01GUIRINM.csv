7767931,5,B01GUIRINM,"A very heart touching movie!!!  Shows the thought processes and emotional turmoil of making the decision to abort a child!  Even though it is a serious movie it also has moments that just make you laugh out loud!  Will also bring you to tears!  Some of the ""logic"" for an abortion boggled my mind and the attitude of the clinic staff in regards to the young ladies just amazed me.  And of course seeing Bruce Marchiano in the role of Jesus was amazing.  He truly has brought the man Jesus to life for me through his many movies........and pay close attention to the car scene!!  LOL  I think this movie should be viewed by every one at least once!  I loved it!",1477785600,3,660,4.344262295081967

7767938,5,B01GUIRINM,"Obviously not a Hollywood film, but a thought-provoking story that should be told. I think it would be helpful for those with an unwanted pregnancy to explore many thoughts and outcomes when it comes to an abortion, adoption or raising a child. I wish there was something more about adoption. So many people want to adopt a child. I wish that was common knowledge to these young women. If you really can't raise that baby, there are others who can.",1526515200,,448,4.6125

7767940,1,B01GUIRINM,"This film has it all-racism, scientific illiteracy, bad acting, no-name actors, classism, sexism, and bad CG.  God takes a break from causing 20% of all wanted pregnancies to miscarry in order to shame Allison into keeping a child she is ill prepared to raise. Her clueless shmuck of a boyfriend, who is too dumb and selfish to figure out how contraception works, never steps up.  Thankfully he is lobbed forward into the ever more shallow gene pool.  Allison engages in a hearty debate with the doctor, which she wins with her high school education.  The fetus is, indeed, alive, just like most all sperm and mildew in your shower.  Everyone in the clinic office is getting an abortion, in contrast to my trip to PP before I could afford insurance payments and *gasp* was diagnosed with a large fibroid and ironically, my fertility was saved.  All employees at this clinic are stereotypes or covert pro-lifers trying to thwart the evil agenda.  God indulges Allison in a metaphysical debate about why life sucks in general.  Basically, we have things like cancer because we are such failures, because Jesus' sacrifice was not enough.  The notorious mop-pushing G then abandons Allison as she struggles to buy diapers and must subsist on WIC checks for the next twelve years.  But hey, keep the unwanted kid(s), worked out great for Andrea Yates.",1524096000,4,1346,4.889867841409692
7767941,5,B01GUIRINM,"This is satirical cinematic brilliance. The movie's ability to lean into the absurdity of religious guilt in relation to abortion is perfectly unsubtle and expertly handled by cast and crew alike. In a master stroke, God is hysterically cast as Everyman's Humbert Humbert (this guy is definitely going to be on next season's ""To Catch a Predator""). Exaggerated racial stereotypes don't waste time with character development and instead commit to representating black people as dumb, morally corrupt, and in desperate need of Christ's salvation (and also a baby). 10 points to Gryffindor.",1523577600,2,587,5.391304347826087

7767954,1,B01GUIRINM,"Any message this film tried to deliver was lost to me by the extreme biased views. Why does a single woman without kids have to automatically be a cat lady?  The reality of unprepared parents more often than not is children end up neglected and abused, living hand to mouth. I think a better message would have been for the girl to find the community that would support her choices.

7767956,2,B01GUIRINM,"First I want to mention that I am a Christian and the reason why most people don't like this movie is the fact it preaches to you instead of showing you a story. The writer should have taken more time to develop the characters and story and not forced a sermon. I found the fact that the two side black characters were generic black stereotypes was a little insulting and I'm not even black. Couldn't the one pushing for abortion be afraid of failing a class or missing a job opportunity? I know there are some black people similar to the ones depicted but why both?

Why was everything told to us by GOD instead of showing them interact with characters? Why did no one wonder about the main characters mental health when she was seeing and talking to characters they couldn't see? What is the point of god being a janitor if he straight out announces who he is?

I did like a few things that they brought up though. The fact that God doesn't hate gays was good although it felt thrown in there. I also like the fact it may get women to think of what they may be giving up and what they should give up. I also liked that they showed the main character in a bad relationship that was believable.

I also think Morgan Freeman made a more likable GOD in Bruce Almighty than this actor did.",1518825600,2,1286,4.283950617283951

7767958,1,B01GUIRINM,"This movie was so cringy-awful that I watched the whole thing! It is blatant pro-choice propaganda, which I'm not even mad about. I have no objection to anyone making a movie promoting their point of view. It was so obviously biased that I had no expectation of it being scientifically accurate. It was soooo embarrassingly racist and sexist. The young black woman bragging about having multiple abortions that she never had to pay for and implying she didn't have a close relationship with the father. The.. ""What kind of name is Fong."" and ""You have ethnic eyes"" (why was that even in there? Were they trying to point out that Alison wasn't white?). ""Keep your drawers on."" The ""crazy cat lady"" nurse who had no husband or children. Interestingly, the male doctor who actually performed the procedures didn't mention any ill consequences from his actions.

I did think the relationship between Alison and Rick seemed believable. The ending was completely expected. I kept watching mainly just to see what kind of outrageously biased stuff they were going to come up with. I kept yelling the especially awful stuff to my husband in his office like, ""OMG you won't believe what he just said!"" That was pretty great.

Ohhhh... I just read that the actor who plays God (the male lead) is also the writer and director. That explains everything.",1518393600,15,1341,4.851528384279476
7767959,5,B01GUIRINM,"Very interesting movie. The part I love the most is when D'Shawn said that we're always about the freedom to do what we want with our bodies. But what about that baby's life? Shouldn't s/he also have that choice?

7767961,2,B01GUIRINM,"Movie was ok until they stereotyped the African American characters. Why do they have to be portrayed as speaking ""hood"" language?  Contrary to what is portrayed in this movie we can have grammatically correct conversations.  I left this movie with the message being... even black folk can choose life. I agree with the abortion issue of this movie as I am Christian but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

Thousands of thousands of baaaabies!"". The only black woman in the film who is a sassy frequent flier at the abortion clinic. When Marta the counselor or whatever insinuates that internal damage is a plausible side effect of a simple pregnancy termination in the first trimester (it ain't). If a janitor claims he or she is Jesus/God and follows you around crying at your next doctor's appointment, dial 911.",1515024000,8,575,5.063157894736842
7767972,1,B01GUIRINM,"The movie is not as advertised but rather is an anti-abortion movie they show in clinics that pose as women's health clinics to prevent women from getting abortions. It presents false information regarding pregnancy, zygote/embryo/fetal development, abortion, and abortion providers. God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are portrayed as ideologues whose theology is that of the West Borough Baptist Church. This and all other character portrayals are necessarily shallow. Its portrayal of the one black couple is offensive in its racism and stereotyping. Everyone in the movie is literate, except the black couple, who are ignorant and stupid, and incapable of uttering a grammatically correct phrase or behaving in an unaffected, normal manner. Every time a woman gets an abortion, movie-god bawls. Quote from receptionist: ""In my day a woman kept her drawers on, because she knew if she didn't, there would be a heavy price to pay."" The movie preys on young women's naivety. Every woman has unlimited financial resources; every unwanted child grows up to be a wonderful person.",1514505600,12,1075,5.292397660818714

As for the side characters who give ""good"" advice in the film they are anything but good & wise company, so that sends mixed messages. On the positive I love the way Jesus reaches out in this movie for the unborn, how the unborn is portrayed despite the fact that half of the time it is not well received.

The young girl does okay, she has a kinda obscure emotionless face at all times.  She looks bored like she doesn't want to be in the movie.
