3145120,5,B0015I2S74,"I am totally in love with this show the characters played by the actors and actresses seem to be one. It is wholesome while it addresses real life issues.
I miss it so much,and I wish, even though nothing good ever seems to last, that it would have continued on and never ended.
This is one DVD collection I will always cherish.",1208563200,2,328,4.306451612903226
3145121,4,B0015I2S74,"With the release of this 6th season quickly approaching, that means that more than half of the series is already out, so being able to collect Seasons 1-11 seems more attainable than ever! Sadly, it appears that the poorly edited episodes and all-too-typical music changes probably won't be addressed, but if you're a big ""7th Heaven"" fan, you can't deny that it's better than not having them on DVD at all.

Like many others, I grew up with this show. I was a fifth grader when it all began, and by the time its last episode aired, I was almost done with college. I think this show will always hold up as one that was brave enough to deal with contemporary issues in a tasteful way, all while portraying a loving American family that managed to stick together, even though they were far from perfect. With each passing year, the social issues presented got deeper without steering away from their classic ""family friendly"" ways. I have to admit that Seasons 1-5 were probably the best, and the first two years were my all-time favorites, when the original Camden kids were young, and before the storylines started getting more complex to accommodate the classic ""growing pains."" It was around Season 6 that I started seeing the show weaken a little bit, but of course, at this point, they were only midway through the series as a whole, and as the kids grew up and new characters were introduced, there was plenty more of a story that the writers wanted to tell.

Season 6 finds oldest child Matt getting into med school at last and receiving his first glimpse at the girl he will eventually marry, whose Jewish roots create a serious clash between the two families. Former ""fallen angel"" Mary, who is trying to deal with her mistakes and has shaped up quite a bit in the past year (despite having a shameless lapse of good judgment every now and then) trains to be an airplane pilot, struggles to rebuild her relationship with her family, and has two men eager to marry her. Good girl Lucy, who convinced her parents to let her get engaged right out of high school at the end of last year, returns home after a summer with her fiance, and chooses to mope around and cry instead of explaining why the ring is suddenly off her finger. Teenager Simon enters a more rebellious world of alcohol, dating, and driving, while sassy young Ruthie--who is probably the most intelligent of the Camden bunch--corresponds by letter with a soldier in the Marine Corps and comes face-to-face with an emotionally damaging teacher from her past. Youngest Camden offpsring Sam and David are only about three now, so there isn't much to say about them (although I can't say there really ever was much to say about them, to be honest). Also present in this season is the infamous ""bad boy"" Robbie Palmer, who begins building a better reputation for himself and serves as both a son and an older brother to the Camden family. Then, of course, there's Eric, who continues dealing with the various trials and tribulations of being a Reverend (which includes coming to terms with his oldest son's desire to convert to Judaism) and Annie, who takes a teaching job at Ruthie's school and finds herself in the middle of a student's domestic problems.

Guest stars include singer Joy Enriquez, the memorable Andrew Keegan as Mary's former boyfriend Wilson, and a first look at the infamous Kevin Kinkirk, who may have what it takes to piece Lucy's broken heart back together. In short, it's not the very best season of the series, but it's still a pretty good one with some very nice moments, most notably (in my opinion) the episode ""Suspicion,"" where 10-year-old Ruthie meets a serious challenge in her young life when she chooses to defend her friendship with a Muslim classmate. If you're a ""7th Heaven"" enthusiast, you'll want to add this one to your DVD collection. Is Season 7 on its way, too? I am confident that it is!

Additional Note: After picking up my Season 6 DVD today (June 10), I noticed that the six individual discs are now grey and do not have the art that the previous 5 season sets had, with the pictures of the Camden family members. There is also a note on the DVD box that they edited some scenes out, and boy, did they ever! The bad thing is that they take a random line or two of dialogue out right in the middle of a scene, so even if you've never seen the episode in your life, there's a really good chance you'll be able to tell, anyway. For instance, Eric's classic ""Popeye the Sailor Man"" joke to Annie in the season opener is removed, which means that Annie's little rant before that is very abruptly cut off, and in the September 11-centered episode, 11-year-old Ruthie is supposed to sing and dance to Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" in the first and last scenes, but because obtaining music rights is such a hassle, they opted to omit the scenes altogether, which is a real bummer, because those two scenes were a pretty big part of the episode. Sadly, they are putting these sets together more and more carelessly with each season, but just the same, I look forward to watching the episodes tonight. If we want these sets on DVD, this is the kind of stuff we must deal with. The good news is that because there are no special features or anything extra, the price is pretty low if you buy it at the right place (Target, Walmart, etc...)",1207008000,40,5347,4.584117032392895
3145122,5,B0015I2S74,"Loved 7th Heaven since the very beginning in 1996. I have to admit I was quite sad to see the show come to a definite end in 2007.  I grew up with this show. What I love about it is that it's totally shameless family tv.  Not the find of thing that you have to worry about your kids watching. There needs to be more shows like this. 7th Heaven always send out good signals to teenagers about making the right shoices in life. They would bring up true to life issues & watch the characters resolve these issues. There is loss, romance, happiness, success. It's just an incredible show & you have to watch the characters evolve from the beginning to the end to truly appreciate the show as I do.  This is one show that will definitely be missed. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Hope we don't have a long wait again!",1205539200,16,825,4.208860759493671

I had mentioned  in a earlier review that Ruthie's character warranted watching meaning that her precociousness seemed too ascendant. In this episode, however, she was outstanding, with her performance galvanizing the family to participate in honoring and then mourning the loss of Sgt. Morgan.

I hope the remainder of the episodes dramatize such themes more than the 'soap-opera'-like nuances of some earlier shows.  Nonetheless, the Camdens are role models worth imitating especially in a time when God seems more and more to be less the focus than material and financial success at any cost.",1417132800,,837,5.065693430656935

It almost made me want to cry i even tried to force myself to cry because it was so sad and heartwarming that Ruthie Camden would ask her own father to do a memorial service for Marine Sgt Dwight J Morgan or was it Marine Sgt Dwight Jf Morgan i have already forgotten his name, im a bananahead! Im trying not to cuss because of my Christianity and it being a sin to cuss. Let no foul word come out of thy mouth or something like that.

3145284,5,B0015I2S74,"Every season of 7th Heaven impresses me in one way or another. Every episode has a beautiful moral message that leaves the viewer contemplating events in their own life and striving to make the best out of bad situations. That's what this show does for me. It encourages me to be a better person and leaves me feeling I'm not alone in wanting to do what's right when those around me just seem to thrive on self-indulgence and ignorance! 7th Heaven sheds a little light on viewers lives and I am so thankful for that. That's enough of my preaching (pun intended). If you've ever enjoyed an episode of 7th Heaven you'll have to get this season, as well. It is well-worth your time :-)

I learn so much from each of these seasons - how to parent, when to see that I am wrong, how to be a good spouse, and so much more.  It's so nice to see TV that's wholesome and that you can let your kids watch with you (most of them).  Thanks to the producers for thinking up some great story lines and casting the actors so well.

I would love love to have 11 seasons on DVD--with the original music of course, but it seems as though that has edited out. Either way, I am so very happy that the possibility of having all 11 seasons seems to be more attainable now than it did a few years ago. In my opinion, this is the best show that has been in TV and I have a lot of favorite shows--but nothing will EVER take the place of 7th Heaven. If I am lucky enough to marry someday, I am doing my best to make my home a Heaven on Earth. Great show...great cast. Sadly missed...I would love to meet the primary stars someday--especially Catherine Hicks and Stephen Collins...Christy in KY 7th fan",1213056000,2,793,4.293333333333333

I miss it so much,and I wish, even though nothing good ever seems to last, that it would have continued on and never ended.
This is one DVD collection I will always cherish.",1208563200,2,328,4.306451612903226
3379618,4,B0015I2S74,"With the release of this 6th season quickly approaching, that means that more than half of the series is already out, so being able to collect Seasons 1-11 seems more attainable than ever! Sadly, it appears that the poorly edited episodes and all-too-typical music changes probably won't be addressed, but if you're a big ""7th Heaven"" fan, you can't deny that it's better than not having them on DVD at all.

Like many others, I grew up with this show. I was a fifth grader when it all began, and by the time its last episode aired, I was almost done with college. I think this show will always hold up as one that was brave enough to deal with contemporary issues in a tasteful way, all while portraying a loving American family that managed to stick together, even though they were far from perfect. With each passing year, the social issues presented got deeper without steering away from their classic ""family friendly"" ways. I have to admit that Seasons 1-5 were probably the best, and the first two years were my all-time favorites, when the original Camden kids were young, and before the storylines started getting more complex to accommodate the classic ""growing pains."" It was around Season 6 that I started seeing the show weaken a little bit, but of course, at this point, they were only midway through the series as a whole, and as the kids grew up and new characters were introduced, there was plenty more of a story that the writers wanted to tell.

Season 6 finds oldest child Matt getting into med school at last and receiving his first glimpse at the girl he will eventually marry, whose Jewish roots create a serious clash between the two families. Former ""fallen angel"" Mary, who is trying to deal with her mistakes and has shaped up quite a bit in the past year (despite having a shameless lapse of good judgment every now and then) trains to be an airplane pilot, struggles to rebuild her relationship with her family, and has two men eager to marry her. Good girl Lucy, who convinced her parents to let her get engaged right out of high school at the end of last year, returns home after a summer with her fiance, and chooses to mope around and cry instead of explaining why the ring is suddenly off her finger. Teenager Simon enters a more rebellious world of alcohol, dating, and driving, while sassy young Ruthie--who is probably the most intelligent of the Camden bunch--corresponds by letter with a soldier in the Marine Corps and comes face-to-face with an emotionally damaging teacher from her past. Youngest Camden offpsring Sam and David are only about three now, so there isn't much to say about them (although I can't say there really ever was much to say about them, to be honest). Also present in this season is the infamous ""bad boy"" Robbie Palmer, who begins building a better reputation for himself and serves as both a son and an older brother to the Camden family. Then, of course, there's Eric, who continues dealing with the various trials and tribulations of being a Reverend (which includes coming to terms with his oldest son's desire to convert to Judaism) and Annie, who takes a teaching job at Ruthie's school and finds herself in the middle of a student's domestic problems.

Guest stars include singer Joy Enriquez, the memorable Andrew Keegan as Mary's former boyfriend Wilson, and a first look at the infamous Kevin Kinkirk, who may have what it takes to piece Lucy's broken heart back together. In short, it's not the very best season of the series, but it's still a pretty good one with some very nice moments, most notably (in my opinion) the episode ""Suspicion,"" where 10-year-old Ruthie meets a serious challenge in her young life when she chooses to defend her friendship with a Muslim classmate. If you're a ""7th Heaven"" enthusiast, you'll want to add this one to your DVD collection. Is Season 7 on its way, too? I am confident that it is!

Additional Note: After picking up my Season 6 DVD today (June 10), I noticed that the six individual discs are now grey and do not have the art that the previous 5 season sets had, with the pictures of the Camden family members. There is also a note on the DVD box that they edited some scenes out, and boy, did they ever! The bad thing is that they take a random line or two of dialogue out right in the middle of a scene, so even if you've never seen the episode in your life, there's a really good chance you'll be able to tell, anyway. For instance, Eric's classic ""Popeye the Sailor Man"" joke to Annie in the season opener is removed, which means that Annie's little rant before that is very abruptly cut off, and in the September 11-centered episode, 11-year-old Ruthie is supposed to sing and dance to Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" in the first and last scenes, but because obtaining music rights is such a hassle, they opted to omit the scenes altogether, which is a real bummer, because those two scenes were a pretty big part of the episode. Sadly, they are putting these sets together more and more carelessly with each season, but just the same, I look forward to watching the episodes tonight. If we want these sets on DVD, this is the kind of stuff we must deal with. The good news is that because there are no special features or anything extra, the price is pretty low if you buy it at the right place (Target, Walmart, etc...)",1207008000,40,5347,4.584117032392895
3379619,5,B0015I2S74,"Loved 7th Heaven since the very beginning in 1996. I have to admit I was quite sad to see the show come to a definite end in 2007.  I grew up with this show. What I love about it is that it's totally shameless family tv.  Not the find of thing that you have to worry about your kids watching. There needs to be more shows like this. 7th Heaven always send out good signals to teenagers about making the right shoices in life. They would bring up true to life issues & watch the characters resolve these issues. There is loss, romance, happiness, success. It's just an incredible show & you have to watch the characters evolve from the beginning to the end to truly appreciate the show as I do.  This is one show that will definitely be missed.

I had mentioned  in a earlier review that Ruthie's character warranted watching meaning that her precociousness seemed too ascendant. In this episode, however, she was outstanding, with her performance galvanizing the family to participate in honoring and then mourning the loss of Sgt. Morgan.

I hope the remainder of the episodes dramatize such themes more than the 'soap-opera'-like nuances of some earlier shows.  Nonetheless, the Camdens are role models worth imitating especially in a time when God seems more and more to be less the focus than material and financial success at any cost.",1417132800,,837,5.065693430656935

It almost made me want to cry i even tried to force myself to cry because it was so sad and heartwarming that Ruthie Camden would ask her own father to do a memorial service for Marine Sgt Dwight J Morgan or was it Marine Sgt Dwight Jf Morgan i have already forgotten his name, im a bananahead! Im trying not to cuss because of my Christianity and it being a sin to cuss. Let no foul word come out of thy mouth or something like that.

Every episode has a beautiful moral message that leaves the viewer contemplating events in their own life and striving to make the best out of bad situations. That's what this show does for me. It encourages me to be a better person and leaves me feeling I'm not alone in wanting to do what's right when those around me just seem to thrive on self-indulgence and ignorance! 7th Heaven sheds a little light on viewers lives and I am so thankful for that. That's enough of my preaching (pun intended). If you've ever enjoyed an episode of 7th Heaven you'll have to get this season, as well. It is well-worth your time :-)

3379798,5,B0015I2S74,&th heaven was one of the best family shows I have seen. Season six was one of the best seasons of the show.,1214179200,,108,3.739130434782609
3379799,5,B0015I2S74,"The complete 6th season of 7th Heaven episodes are
great. But the disc layout is boring silver no color
like the last 5 seasons. I wish the words on the
discs were black to stand out. The words are just
cut outs just hardly readable. I hope the following
seasons aren't like this one as far as the discs
layout goes. They are 100% better with color.
I truly do enjoy the show itself.",1213315200,,383,4.1891891891891895
3379800,5,B0015I2S74,"I have watched the show for years...I love it and could not imagine not having it. 7th Heaven offered me so much hope and inspiration. I would love love to have 11 seasons on DVD--with the original music of course, but it seems as though that has edited out. Either way, I am so very happy that the possibility of having all 11 seasons seems to be more attainable now than it did a few years ago. In my opinion, this is the best show that has been in TV and I have a lot of favorite shows--but nothing will EVER take the place of 7th Heaven. If I am lucky enough to marry someday, I am doing my best to make my home a Heaven on Earth. Great show...great cast. Sadly missed...I would love to meet the primary stars someday--especially Catherine Hicks and Stephen Collins...Christy in KY 7th fan",1213056000,2,793,4.293333333333333

8258752,3,B0015I2S74,Very good season 6. My favorite episode is how the Camden family paid tribute to a fallen marine and others who made the ultimate sacrifice.,1513382400,,140,4.64
8258753,3,B0015I2S74,"This review is specific to season 6.  I really liked this show until this season, but I must say the writers really dropped the ball.  The show went from a cute family drama that showed the loving but sometimes difficult relationships in a big family to drama for the sake of drama.  For starters, the portrayal of Anne going through menopause is the ridiculous old stereotype of the ""crazy woman,""  which honestly is an insult to women in general.  Her behavior towards her husband in particular was over the top and was not in any way funny.  In reality, they would have been in divorce court.  Second, the entire premise of Matt's quickie marriage was overdone.  They were already married, yet several episodes were spent in planning and showing a wedding that was an outright lie to the family.  I was really disappointed that they did not come clean, as I don't think lying and being unable to communicate with your family is a very positive or Christian message.  It is as if they just ran out of good plot lines so the writers just made the most drama possible.  Finally, the amount of time spent in several of the episodes focusing on people kissing was overdone.  This is supposed to be family friendly, I'm an adult and don't want to watch people kiss all day, it was just gross!

  I really liked the show up until this season, so I will continue to watch the rest of the episodes in the hopes that it gets better.  There were a few gems like the episodes about the solider and the Muslim girl, I hope the later seasons follow along those lines.  Overall, it is still a good show, especially because by this point if you make it to season 6 you are invested in the characters and want to see what happens next, but I am very surprised the show got renewed for 11 seasons given the poor writing.",1499385600,,1805,4.437689969604863
