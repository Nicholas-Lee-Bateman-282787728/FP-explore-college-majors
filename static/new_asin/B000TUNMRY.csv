8211000,2,B000TUNMRY,"""Adobe Photoshop CS3 for Video Editors"" is, sadly, not really worth the money or time I invested into the DVD. While Jeremy Rasmussen (the presenter) is clearly a talented Adobe Photoshop user who has selected an interesting project to show off the power of the program for video producers/editors, this does not translate as well as you might hope into a useful instructional video.

The biggest problem with this DVD is that the production values are amateurish, at best. Jeremy often makes incorrect selections and has to backtrack, menus he is trying to show occasionally do not fully display on the screen, and the overall pacing is very rushed.

A few simple things would have made this well worth the cost, such as Jeremy planning the flow a little better, addition of on screen text to show presets (etc), and a slower more in-depth coverage of the video specific features.

There are some useful bits to be learned from the video (the Data Merge feature and Animation Pallet come to mind), but overall this really is more of an appetizer rather than a main course for serious video users who want to use Photoshop to enhance their productions.

This is not the most expensive instructional video on the market, so I'm not really out all that much, but I would gladly have paid more to get a more useful and better produced product. Not recommended.",1248825600,,1357,4.761702127659574
