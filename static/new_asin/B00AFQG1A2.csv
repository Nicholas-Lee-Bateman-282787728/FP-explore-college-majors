5423651,3,B00AFQG1A2,"The Mooring comes across as two separate films. The first half consists of a group of giggly young girls going camping/boating. They are all in trouble due to their addiction to the electronic media: i.e shyness, accident while texting, cyber bullying, writing Amazon reviews etc. They give up the gizmo world and are assigned tasks like ""write a hand written letter"" or play a board game...things they have difficult doing. I really liked this aspect of the movie as the effect the electronic media has had on society still lacks data points.

This was a way to build character and to eliminate cell phones before it digresses into a bad abduction story with a guy who plays violent video games and has trouble relating to people.

The main problem I had was there were too many girls to get to know. It was difficult to establish all those characters. The second problem I had was that the first half of the picture was pretty darn decent as a separate film. I resented the second half as it didn't meet with my formulaic expectations: The girls learn skills and then bond and combine their skills to ""Rambo"" their foe. Instead the second half was a second rate human prey film.

For several of the actresses, this was their first film, apparently college drama students. They did a first rate job, perhaps having lived the early roles that they played. Having said that, if you expect a horror film, expect one with more screams then horror. There is really no suspense or terror factor. Might work as a fright film for young teen girls.

5423652,5,B00AFQG1A2,I rented this movie not expecting much well I was wrong. First this movie is one you can watch more than just once. The acting is great. I had to add this movie to my collection. My friends also loved the movie.,1363824000,2,211,4.0476190476190474
5423653,1,B00AFQG1A2,It is a very stupid and idiotic plot...and a complete waste of time. I wonder what IQ level or lack of imagination it takes for the directors to come up with such a nonsensical story-line.,1362614400,,188,4.4
5423654,2,B00AFQG1A2,"THE MOORING has a fairly simplistic plot-----looney psycho and his subservient female sidekick chase a bevy of young girls through a forest, then offing them one by one.  No reason for these killings is ever explained.
The real problem with THE MOORING is its lethargic pacing and its lightweight script.  The girls are inter-changeable with little distinctive traits.  It's really just boring.",1362528000,,394,5.32258064516129

5423656,4,B00AFQG1A2,"Thomas Wilson Brown is perfect as the creepy villain.  This is more of a suspense/thriller than a horror film, and that's not a bad thing. You actually feel sorry for these girls because they look like actual high school girls, not typical Hollywood mid-to-late twenty year olds. The thing I really liked about The Mooring was that it's not your typical slasher film, yes there's plenty of that, but it paces nicely. Sure, I would have liked to see more of a background on why the killer became crazy, but there are plenty of surprises and the cinematography was really impressive for being a low budget indie film.  Definitely worth an evening watch.  You'll never think of the river the same again!",1361404800,7,700,4.721311475409836
5423657,4,B00AFQG1A2,"I'm not going to lie. I watched this movie solely because I never got over my childhood crush on Thomas Wilson Brown. But seriously, I enjoyed this movie. To start with, take it for what it is, which is basically a stalker/slasher film. Helpless females being pursued by relentless killer. The reason this works for me, however, is that for starters, there is not a lot of blood/gore/sex. If there is profanity I missed it. That might deter a lot of horror fans, but as someone who appreciates the story rather than the gore, I liked it. Also, the acting is not bad at all. Hallie Todd is convincing as the therapist. The girls are not your typical horror movie dumb blondes with fake chests. They are real and I really liked that. There might have been a few too many, making it hard to emotionally invest in any one however.  And Thomas Wilson Brown really works the role of brutal killer. (If he has stayed out of acting because of fear of being typecast after Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael, he can forget it! No danger of typecasting here...) The big thing for me is I would have liked to have seen more of a backstory. I would have liked to know why he was a brutal killer and how he got his partner to go along with it...But I was left to speculate and perhaps that was intentional on the part of the writers. Overall a good indie film.",1361404800,6,1369,4.34765625
5423658,4,B00AFQG1A2,"The Mooring is more affecting than the usual crazed-stalker-in-the-woods film. It cares enough to lend some plausibility to the girls predicament. A group of young women are sent out on a milder Outward Bound sort of excursion away from their accustomed urban comforts. All of them have been compulsive over-users of cell phone and Internet technology, sometimes with serious consequences. So theres a reason for their being set down in the woods without a working cell phone among them.

Then the conversation here is much more realistic than the usual film-version of conversation among teens before they start getting picked off by backwoods psychopaths. While the two-hour limitations of the film doesnt allow us to get to know all nine girls very well, we do get a glimpse of some of their distinctive personalities. Whats most refreshing is that these girls conversation isn't limited to foul-mouthed belligerence towards each other. If fact, theres no such road rage high volume verbal abuse at all, even when one or the other of them displays some very irritating quirks. The others tend to indulge their comrades idiosyncrasies, and to even be polite about them. A real film rarity!

This group leader-counselor is also a more believable, interesting person than we usually encounter in any scary movie. She has a low-key, quiet manner that, on top of her delicate adult beauty, draws the viewer into her circle.

But overall, there isn't a lot of dialogue in this movie. The long, waiting silences add to the tension.

However, its the films ending that most distinguishes it. Perhaps you cant quite term the ending a twist, but it carries the full-blown surprise of forgotten elements  suddenly recalled. You won't feel the shock of this surprise until the very last line of the film though. So wait for it wait for it",1361145600,15,1829,4.983606557377049

8551039,4,B00AFQG1A2,"The plot: A dozen or so teenage girls who are each dealing with some drama or changes in their lives embark on a guidance program that takes them on a short boating/camping excursion. The purpose of the trip is to get away from all of the social-network technology in their lives. So: no phones, everyone!

Whereupon they are beset by a pair of homicidal killers, and have to fend for themselves. If it weren't so tragic, it would almost be ironic, doncha think?

THE MOORING is not for every horror-movie fan's taste, but then again, what movie could be? Many will not like this film's sense of naturalism (not ""realism""), and  think it moves too slowly, or a lot of other elements. But it is certainly a well-made and I believe intelligent movie, that allows the audience to mourn not just for its victims, but in an existential way for itself as well. The film tries, and I think succeeds, in creating characters that we can see as helpless and out of their element: I was deeply saddened and moved by their plight in a way that, for example, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT back in the '70s merely left me depressed. THE MOORING is a much better-directed and -acted movie, and although it may not impress the casual stalking-assassin film buff, those with any sort of empathy will find it a cold, doomed, and traumatic experience. As far as the acting, it was refreshing to see 15 and 16 year-old young women playing characters their own ages, without a script forcing one or more of them into typical horror-film tropes (as anyone who's seen a FRIDAY THE 13TH movie knows). Instead, these characters seem fragile, humane, and even relatable. (If ya really wanna get tech-y, fans of director Kelly Reichardt might see that same sense of naturalism in MOORING director Glenn Withrow's marvelous sense of composition: startlingly good cinematography and sound for a micro-budgeted picture.)",1407110400,3,1887,4.764525993883792

8551041,4,B00AFQG1A2,"This movie was very realistic. For that reason, I had a hard time watching it in several scenes. I thought the teenage girls did a fantastic job in this movie- they made it seem that much more real. There is a lot of suspense in this movie and you see things play out that you just don't want to think is going to happen but sadly does. I thought the killer did a great job in the movie too- you would have really thought this guy was a nut with the really good acting. I literally had to keep telling me myself it was just a movie and had to fast forward some parts because it was too real and hard to watch. I didn't know what to expect when I got this at redbox but it was excellent. The back premise to it is pretty cool too which makes it that much more real. The director and actors did an excellent job.",1374451200,2,810,3.9754601226993866
