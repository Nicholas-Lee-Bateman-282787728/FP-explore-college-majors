8511360,2,B0076ZKR5A,"This is the most annoying dvd set on the face of the planet! Before I bought I read the reviews and trusted that it was a good quality series.
It actually seems like it was made in a home computer using the worst gifs and clip arts that could be found. There is very little clips using real people, most of it  is animated, poorly, I may say. Each episode wastes precious time in random animations that have nothing to do with subject presented.
While it does a good job teaching kids words and phrases, the quality of the product is so low that takes away the good from it.",1463788800,3,574,4.218181818181818

8511362,5,B0076ZKR5A,"Wonderful way to introduce kids to Portuguese vocabulary and a few basic phrases.  My girls (4 and 7) enjoy watching it, though only for brief periods at a time.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars b/c, as far as I can tell (we haven't watched all the videos, only up to 3), there isn't any verb conjugation and I would've liked that to be included.  It's great for very young kids and the illustrations are adorable.  So happy that there is continental Portuguese available instead of just the usual Brazilian Portuguese.",1435622400,,520,4.559139784946237
8511363,5,B0076ZKR5A,Great product my kids learned a lot of Portuguese and they loved learning as well! They always couldn't wait for the next lesson.  Highly recommended!,1434499200,,150,5.0
8511364,5,B0076ZKR5A,"I was looking for a Portuguese curriculum for my kids for homeschool and to supplement their father speaking to them in Portuguese. Since he is from Portugal and not Brazil I wanted European Portuguese. I was about to give up when a friend told me about Dino Lingo. Not only did I finally find European Portuguese but it was designed for young kids, something I also hadn't seen before. The kids learned a lot of vocabulary words from the Dino Lingo DVD's and a few phrases, with the addition of the storybooks they were able to put some of those vocab words to use in sentences and see the words in print. We read the storybook with the cd and then work on reading it without the cd. We use the vocab words in real conversations whenever we can to reinforce the language. The DVD's are engaging, my 2 year old son even loved them and learned to count to 10 and all the colors in Portuguese and English easily and at the same time.",1433462400,,931,4.325714285714286
8511365,5,B0076ZKR5A,"I loved these dvds!!!! I speak Portuguese and my husband English, so my 3 year old knows both languages, although he speaks more in English, so I was trilled when I found these...I highly recommend this product! Love, love, love it!",1415923200,4,232,4.682926829268292
8511366,4,B0076ZKR5A,"To this day the plastic container that holds the DVDs wreaks of some harsh chemical agent, not sure what that's about, but I keep it out of the kids reach and hold my breath whenever I open it and then wash my hands.  Come to think of it, I should just get a new case, duh. Good news is, the kids love it and have started picking up on basic words and phrases.  Mine are ages 1-5, and we're planning a trip to Brazil in 2014, I think they'll be at least prepared enough not to go into culture shock.  We do other language work in addition.",1372809600,5,539,4.018691588785047
