8404263,5,B003SFVJJK,My children three and seven have watched hundreds of animation movies but none delights like the Adventures of Donkey Ollie especially Shipwrecked the third in a five part series. Produced by the award winning team at Boat Angel and Car Angel  Donkey Ollie seems to capture the essence of children's entertainment. The musical adventure features original songs and none stop action underwater and above water. I receomment this for anyone with children. Godly moral entertainment in a world where children need all the divine guidance they can get. This is produced by academy award nominated director Douglas Aberle and features music from Northern Light Orchestra's Brian Stewart.,1301702400,,682,5.373831775700935
