7954379,5,B00005U59Y,Prior to purchasing the 32 Form Sword I had purchased Dr. Lam's  6 Form Tai Chi.  Dr. Lam demonstrates both from the front and back positions the forms needed in  32 Form Sword.,1372291200,3,177,4.303030303030303
7954380,4,B00005U59Y,Very well done.  This is a great help in learning and remembering the form while you are studying with a teacher.  The main problem is finding a teacher who teaches this form the same way. The detailed instructions and multi-angle video shots do a great job of documenting the form but are no substitute for a good teacher.,1207958400,6,323,4.551724137931035
7954381,5,B00005U59Y,"In case you are interested in learning the basic 32  taichi sword forms I highly recommend you buy  this video.

It gives detailed and step-by-step instructions that even a novice like me, can follow them.

It would be desirable Mr Lam produce it in DVD form but in the meantime don't miss the opportunity to buy it in video format.

  I really appreciate his teaching methods.",1136160000,2,377,4.621212121212121
