6108662,4,B00GSTHCS0,"This time the 52 year old Canadian survivalist finds himself in the
harshest regions of Mexico and Norway....alone, and this time for 10 days.
It's been slightly over a decade since the beginning of Survivorman,
and with age there has been a decline, not only in Les's vigor for the
show, but in the running time and locations as well.....

Season One: Nearly 7hrs. in running time in 9 locations.
Season Two: 5 hrs. in 6 locations (An additional episode for The-Making-Of).
Season Three: Nearly 4  hrs. in 6 locations.
Season Four: Nearly 3 hrs. in 2 locations.

I've concluded that due to Les's age and likely being burned out, the
producers decided to lighten his load by increasing the days spent surviving
and limiting the locations. So, what you have in Season 4 is 4 episodes
each documenting 5 days. This is certainly bare bones in comparison to
Season 1 and 2, and running closely behind Season 3. Season 4 also lacks
the upbeat soundtrack that the earlier seasons provided.

Is it still watchable? Absolutely. Does it still contain valuable survival
tips? Sure. Does Les play the harmonica? Naturally.

The highlight is his time spent in Mexico; the scenery alone as in most
episodes is breathtaking and serene, despite the underlying dangers. And
this time, you're left with a surrealistic feeling. The Norway locale, though
brutally unforgiving, is also a place of beauty and is apparently his
most formidable experience to date. Skepticism arises however when a starving
Stroud finds a vacant, unlocked cabin and a garbage bag stuffed with a recently
skinned deer carcass. Les rarely curses, but his near-fatal decision to
precariously climb down a steep, icy cliff, and out of communication range,
prompts him to do so and is a sobering reminder of how important clear
decision-making is in survival, and how frail human life truly is.

This season also begs the question: just how long will Les continue? As
long as they produce it, I'll consume it; even if Les is wheelchair bound and
is showing the imminent dangers of surviving a retirement home.",1396828800,24,2064,4.899713467048711

6108802,4,B00GSTHCS0,"I've always liked survivorman series. I wish it was just longer, 2 long episodes. I think the previous multi episodes have more rewatchability due to the varied content and locations.  But that said, I like supporting the guy, he does an awesome job of entertaining me and teaching me a few things in the process. He's very real. So I'm glad I bought it.",1424390400,3,354,4.53125

8627011,5,B00GSTHCS0,"This is a great dvd about survival. You know I don't really believe that reality shows typically show much reality. This show is/was different.

This was one of the first series I looked for when I cut cable. My ex wife was suspicious about Les and thought he was overrated. This DVD convinced her otherwise.

This is only two two part episodes after the main 3 seasons but it is really great. He has to survive on an island in Mexico and Norway in winter for 10 days instead of the typical 7.

One of the sets convinced my wife this is real as you can see him concerned and he admitted it. He got lucky and that helped him survive in a major way.

Les Stroud has a great sense of humility and since he shoots his scenes and produces his show he keeps in the mistakes. He is just as happy showing his wrong decisions as the right ones as the goal is survival.

I know he has a support crew nearby but many times he can't communicate w them even if he wanted. I could give a big synopsis of each show but my idea is why would you wish to watch the show then.

He gives a more realistic feel of what it takes to survive in the wilderness whether desert jungle on the ocean or in the artic. This DVD provides a summer/desert and winter/ snow episodes.",1493510400,,1248,4.136363636363637
8627012,5,B00GSTHCS0,"Love the survivorman shows, entertaining way to to give some insite to survival ideas. This one is good, but les is giving opportunities that aren't likely going to happen in ""real life"" like the fact he finds a hunters cabin with an animal carcass available to him wrapped in plastic. Lol, entertaining for sure, but there's also a lot of good information regarding survival techniques. Just wish there were more survival dvds available on Amazon, and not have to purchase them from the survivorman website in Canada.",1493510400,,518,4.9655172413793105

8627015,2,B00GSTHCS0,"I absolutely love Les Stroud, and was addicted to ""Survivorman"" from the first episode I saw.  I'm not even into real life survival skills, but I soaked up his every word like a sponge! I bought the first 3 seasons and I'm surprised the DVDs haven't melted as often as I've watched them.  I loved watching his fierce passion, unmatched knowledge and skills, the bravery and mental strength he displayed, the way he would subtly sneak humor into a survival show, his talent with film documentary, the amount of education he provided, and of course, the harmonica cameos by fireside under the moon...even the soundtrack and voice over during the first 3 seasons was absolutely incredible!!  So I bought this season, ""Survivorman Ten Days"" with such insane anticipation! I could hardly wait to get it into the DVD player.

*Sigh*  What a disappointment.  This ""season"" is absolutely nothing like the previous 3.  The passion just isn't there. The music is gone.  He provides almost no education for a survivor in his situation/location, the specific ecosystems, plant life, etc., or any of the tips he used to so eagerly explain. I was actually embarrassed for him as the props he ""happened to find"" were so obviously placed there ahead of time.  It just wasn't like Les at all. His affect was drastically different. Not only that, but it was just flat out boring. I had trouble staying awake.  He really did no true surviving to speak of... he walked, and ""found"" things that made it more like camping/exploring except for the time he ""found"" a house and slept inside a warm bed, and then ""'found"" a freshly killed deer to eat that someone mysteriously ""left behind.""  Only 4 episodes, in 2 locations. What in the world happened with your production team?? I want the old Les back, we needed more than 3 seasons; he had SO much to offer!!  I'm not saying it's not worth adding to your collection IF you're a huge Les fan, but if you're wanting to learn, I'd stick with the originals, or check out ""Man, Woman, Wild.""  I don't necessarily regret buying it and as long as you don't expect it to be anything like the first 3 seasons,or if you've never seen him before, you may enjoy it more.  I really wish he would stop if he's lost the passion, or if he's feeling too old, or even if he would rather pursue one of his other passions.. because this season was NOT the Les Stroud I've watched and adored for years.  Follow your passions, don't continue to do this for the money.  You're so talented and you've already been so fortunate.  Your loyal fans deserve better, and for that matter so does the younger generation who looks up to you!",1474156800,4,2636,4.622317596566524
