Each of these  workouts flow with one another and having the box set means less money and  you can follow through with the total workout.  I love this series because  they are a are fun to do, combining dance, yoga, weights, and Pilates to  give you a challenging full body workout that doesn't stress out your body.  These tapes are set up so that if you don't have a lot of time to workout,  you can just do one section and you will still sweat.  You can also mix and  match certian routines to keep your workout interesting. I would recomend  these tapes for anyone who is tired of repitition workouts and who are  ready to have fun and be creative while sweating away.",967593600,8,803,4.273333333333333
