8610003,2,B001RVVL7W,"First, the guy on the cover isn't even in the video. The whole video is the same two guys, sometimes with a woman (naked, but not involved in the sex). The one guy is a slim twink, the other is older, with an average build. The film either is, or is made to appear to be, '70's gay stags. The picture is grainy and faded. It is also recorded outside, so the lighting is poor. The sex is bland, and mostly filmed from too far away to see clearly. The fact that it is ""bareback"" is promoted on the cover, but most of the action is oral anyway, so it hardly matters. There is also a big use of double images, often at key moments, which obscures the action even more.",1403222400,,664,4.076335877862595
