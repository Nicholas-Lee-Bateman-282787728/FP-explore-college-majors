1777366,5,B00006IUJ1,"This movie may be unfamiliar to American viewers, who watch american movies only. But this is a very humorous movie, starring some of Russia's best comedians - Yuri Nikulin and Andrei Mironov.

In Bulgaria, they used to show it on every New Year's day.

The plot is like this: A russian turist (Nikulin) in Istanbul slips and falls and says ""Chort Poberi"" (which means something like ""damn"", or ""hell"", or ""go to the devil"" in russian language.)

This happens to be a password for some bandits, who await their man (Mironov) to smuggle diamonds in the cast of his would-be broken arm. Without realizing what is happening, Nikulin's character smuggles the diamonds. Then he has encounters both with the russian police and with the bandits. And there is a happy end...

Watch this film, I'm sure you will enjoy it. In Bulgaria, you can legally buy it on a DVD for just $2.",1160179200,6,870,4.666666666666667
1777367,5,B00006IUJ1,"An hilarious movie about mistaken identity, the Russian mafia, the KGB and an unsuspecting nice guy in the middle of it all!

Nikulin is hilarious as usual, and what can you say about the peerless Mironov?

I watched this movie back in St. P some 14 years ago, and even when my Russian was just in the basic stage I could still follow it. Once my Russian progressed, I grasped all the very funny word play and situational humour.

If you like enjoying yourself - buy this movie!",1153180800,5,478,4.409090909090909
1777368,5,B00006IUJ1,"I have read one negative review about this film and I would like to clarify the statements made in it. I am Russian so, obviously, I like this film. It has typical Russian humor, it is a farce, so do not look for higher meanings in the jokes, it makes fun of the social standards of the Soviet regime as well as the people who served it so well. It features some of the best Russian actors that we love seeing and acting; they sing in the movie and it is lovely as well. If you are a tough judge of movies, then please make sure you know Soviet history a bit and understand that the humor differs from what you see in American movies before you call it crap.

I do not see why there should be a problem with characters not talking for the first ten minutes of the movie. In fact, it is just a few minutes during which you are shown the premise of the movie. And as for cyrillic letters not making sense: this is a Russian movie and you are bound to see everything written in our gibberish alphabet. Besides, the movie begins with a cruise in a foreign country (it was shot in Baku, Azerbajan but is supposed to be Turkey). The language spoken by the locals as well as the signs on buildings are gibberish - it was made up specially for the movie.

That said, I want to say a few words about the plot. Semen Semenovich is a diligent Russian economist goes on a cruise, where he gets acquainted with a mafia mob's right hand, Kozodoev, whose assignment is to pick up diamonds from the supplier and deliver it back to Moscow via a cast on his arm. During one of the last stops, Semen Semenovich gets mistaken for Kozodoev and ends up with a cast and jewels inside it. As he returns to Moscow, Semen contacts the police. Now, he has to pose as bait and escape the traps elaborately planted by the mafia.

As I already said, the movie is fantastic. Just remember that it is a farce. And no, there is not slapstick humour. Be open-minded and enjoy! Oh, and by the way, all the jewelry you will see on the screen is authentic. It's mentioned in the beginning that the film crew would like to thank all Soviet individuals who lend their gems for the filming.",1138233600,32,2150,4.239024390243903
1777369,5,B00006IUJ1,"This movie is the greatest classic comedy ever. Don't listen to the lady, who gave this movie only 2 stars, she doesn't know what she is talking about. Only person with the limited sence of humor may not like this film. Believe me it's wonderfull.!!!!!",1112572800,9,252,4.622222222222222
1777370,2,B00006IUJ1,"Every review I've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just don't get it.  No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it, and by then you're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters, it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next.  If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming, then I guess I can see the appeal.  Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases.  I have to wonder what they could be: ""Damned Melon!"" or ""I passed out when I broke my wrist, and when I woke up, the cast was already on!""???  I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor, because they say completely different things, or omit speech altogether.  In sum, don't waste your time.",1108512000,5,827,4.48
1777371,5,B00006IUJ1,This movie is one of those films that never grow old. It's been the total hit for more than 30 years. Sparkling humour won't let you be bored. The acting is great! Phrases from the movie are now popular aphorisms! The movie arises in you the warmest feelings! Enjoy this movie!,1072656000,13,277,4.450980392156863
1777372,5,B00006IUJ1,"This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this movie. Buy it, and enjoy.",1043020800,16,256,4.468085106382978

7969434,4,B00006IUJ1,"The Diamond Arm is a 1968 Russian comedy directed by Lenoid Gaidai. The movie is about a sweet family man, Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov (Yuri Nikulin), that goes on a tourist cruise alone and befriends his bunkmate, a jewel smuggler/courier. Semyon and his new friend, Gennady Kozodoev (Andrei Miranov), travel the world on a tourist cruise ship. Arriving in Istanbul, Turkey, Semyon gets a tour of the city and accidentally slips on a piece of watermelon. The Turkish co-conspirators do not know what the smuggler looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a secret phrase to identify himself. They  mistake Semyon for his friend Gennady because he uttered the secret phrase damned melon when he slipped. He is taken to a nearby ""clinic"", where an arm cast, being a decoy for jewelery and diamonds inside is put on his arm. Back in the Soviet Union, Semyon tells the police what happened and they use him as bait to catch the criminals. The rest of the movie consists of various attempts of the smugglers to steal the cast back from Semyon.
The movie was released in 1968 so I was skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy an older, foreign film but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie takes you through many different settings and plot twists that keep the movie interesting. They picked a great main character, Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov, who is a family man and dad that grabs the hearts of the audience with his nave personality. I love the way the director ended the movie and how it changes from The Diamond Arm to The Broken Leg. The only critique I have for the movie is that some of the acting was over the top and dramatic, but that seems to be common of films from that era. The film contains some violence but no language or nudity and is appropriate for most audiences. Overall the film is entertaining and holds the audiences attention. I would recommend the movie, it is well worth a couple hours of your time.",1394582400,,1944,4.6347826086956525

The russians have a sense of humor that is soooo unique that takes awhile to get it.  The love poking fun at the government and the system they live under.  They also love to tease each other , celebrate special occasions , and they truly value their friendships.",1364860800,,384,4.521739130434782

7969438,5,B00006IUJ1,"There are some excellent reviews here, so Im not gonna repeat and summarize what this movie is about, im just gonna try to capture why I like it.

1) Actors such as Yuriy Nikulin and Andrey Mironov who plays a stylish gangster with the name that can be roughly translated to Russian as a ""person who milks goats"", having all the manners of an aristocrat and requesting a glass of champagne and a cup of coffee for breakfast (after a major screw up on the job),he gets a typical response from his buddy ""after we get to the boss, you gonna have all that and more"" after which he comically gives ""the aristocrat"" a  Chaplinesque shove in the head. Result - meeting with the boss with a hugely blown up ear that doesn't not go very well with his manners.

2) Music - ""The Rabbit Song"" performed by Yuiri Nikulin (Simeon Semenich) has become a folk song since than and is sung at least once on all the barbecues if not weddings an parties. All the others as well.

Conclusion: Going to Turkey in those days theoretically meant a potential defection to the West. Therefore, there was certain amount of tension related with travelling abroad. The movie capitalizes on that perfectly and thus makes peace between the East and the West. Its really awsome.",1256515200,2,1247,4.553571428571429
7969439,5,B00006IUJ1,"Language barriers cause an initial possibility for comprehending the cinematographic masterpieces undisputedly.

Produced with three sound tracks and subtitles in eleven languages, DVD surely attempts to minimize comprehensive problems of foreign public watching this musical comedy of the USSR of the epoch called later ""Brezhnev's Zastoj"" (""Brezhev's Epoch of Stagnation"", named after Leonid Brezhnev, a long-lasted communist ruler of the Soviet Union of the Olympiad-80).

A story is simple: while a Soviet-era cruise ship was visiting some Mediterranean Sea countries, contraband treasures were hidden into applied gypsum of a wrong person touring. Back in the USSR, a smugglers' ring tries recovering the valuables.

Bearing in mind at least two factors -till the Perestroika of the last century eighties BOTH overseas trips were a top privilege of only top loyal, KGB-cleared Soviet citizens of a particular social status AND Soviet specific mentality and living style much differed from the Western logic- this produce of 1969 had been seen as a satire on a regime imbedded from a notion of a pitiful normality of local viewers' surrounding and, as it, became a hit and cult movie for generations oncoming.

A film, full of music and SOVIET-style humour, is a living memory of a bright talented cast involved and a clever testimony and reminder of a history in making.

Highly recommended.",1238544000,2,1396,5.385321100917431

7969441,5,B00006IUJ1,"This is a clever Soviet time comedy. Acting is superb. However, it is not the American style humor. Rather, it can be compared to other European comedies of the Louis de Funes type. You may need to watch it two or three times for complete appreciation.
The movie is also very educational - you learn a lot about life in the Soviet Union during the late 60-ties.",1232755200,,361,4.402985074626866
