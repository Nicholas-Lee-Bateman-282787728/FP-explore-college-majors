5731208,5,B00CMYRUY6,"I enjoyed this movie. It was refreshing that Christ was portrayed accurately, as well as, salvation being a change in our heart's desires as evidenced by changes in our lives as opposed to I repeated this prayer and am now a ""Christian"". Sin should be called sin, not euphemisms like naughty. illbehonest.com is a great website if you have questions about what it means to truly be a follower of Jesus Christ.",1484524800,,409,4.694444444444445

5731217,3,B00CMYRUY6,It was a little depressing but appreciated the true story.  Life isn't always a happy ending but this seemed to end up that way.  Hard to watch someone going through depression.,1463961600,,177,4.67741935483871
5731218,5,B00CMYRUY6,Love it when the story has a happy ending!! The two brothers had a much to rough a life after they lost their parents. Makes us realize how lucky we are to have a Mom and Dad. Even if you just have one or the other you are not an orphan.,1463097600,,237,3.6666666666666665

5731228,4,B00CMYRUY6,Good movie,1441670400,,10,4.5
5731229,4,B00CMYRUY6,"Over all it is good. It has a good message. Since it is a true story, it gives real insight to what some families go thru - what they think, and how they do or do not cope.  I like the discussions about ""being a Christian""  they don't beat anyone over the head with it, yet they say enough to help people understand.
  I suppose if people are used to watching Disney and other made up adventures created soley for entertainment (no matter what lies they tell), then this may seem a bit slow; but it gives you time to think!  Recently I have view the first 15 min of several films that are Waaayyyy slower than this. The pace suits me fine.",1441065600,2,639,4.162601626016261
5731230,5,B00CMYRUY6,"Beautiful story about love, psychiatric & social issues, as well as family with a Christian message.  I really enjoyed the ""based-on-a-true-story"" script.  It's not only compelling, but deals with real issues facing families in many countries all the time.  The acting is good and believable.  The characters are true-to-life.  Good family movie that could lead to a lot of interesting family discussions!",1439510400,2,405,5.467741935483871

5731238,3,B00CMYRUY6,"There are not many movies I don't like but I am picky when it comes to Christian movies that are missing a clear message of Christ and the hope we have in Him due to the resurrection, praise His name. Dr Bill Mac lean",1414713600,2,217,3.9545454545454546

5731244,3,B00CMYRUY6,"Low budget, poor acting but the overall story is okay. There is an unfair bias or discrimination against the atheist grandparents. for example: they are asked if they give the boys affection... suggesting that because they aren't Christian they can't possibly show physical affection to the children.

It is a rather slow moving story line so patience is necessary to get to the resolution aka happy ending for the family.",1411948800,,422,5.0285714285714285
5731245,5,B00CMYRUY6,"Story is relevant for today. It is an independent foreign film so acting and film can drag at times but don't let that stop you from continuing. It is a needed subject matter in todays :""throw away"" family society. We all need this mom's fight to keep our family together no matter how long it takes.

8583697,4,B00CMYRUY6,This movie encouraged my faith during a difficult time  -- partly because it was so painfully real.  (Thank you for telling this story!),1512086400,,136,4.869565217391305
8583698,5,B00CMYRUY6,"At first the movie starts out slow. But once the story line is built, the movie gets very good. I love how Jesus always wins.",1510185600,,125,4.04
8583699,4,B00CMYRUY6,"This is a great story that really needed to be told.  Even though it is filmed  in a very plain, simplistic British way, it is definitely a good film, especially if you stick it out until the end.",1506729600,,196,4.131578947368421

8583701,3,B00CMYRUY6,"Good Christian and family values film, but either the story or its telling was weak. I held out hoping the climax would be compelling but it wasn't. The kids were cute and they did their best. The adult actors did what they could with a limp script and plot. ""True story"" accounts such as this should be made into movies only if they have enough drama to hold interest then make a strong and less already obvious conclusion.",1495324800,,424,4.448717948717949
