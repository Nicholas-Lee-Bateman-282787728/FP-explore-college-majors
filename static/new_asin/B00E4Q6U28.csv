8601016,3,B00E4Q6U28,The band members look like they are bored. Video and audio quality are excellent. I own hundreds of concert DVD. This disc is rated near the bottom.,1382313600,5,148,4.518518518518518
8601017,2,B00E4Q6U28,"If you want to see Paul Carrack's back or the guitarist's wristwatch or lots closeups of microphone stands, then this is your five-star concert video. I didn't find the sound to be bad at all. Paul Carrack didn't sound off key to me. But I couldn't get past the horrible directing.",1381363200,6,281,4.529411764705882
8601018,2,B00E4Q6U28,"I had high hopes in this concert since I basically grew up when this music was on the airwaves. This concert is from the band's twilight years. Paul Carrick's voice is off key and very raspy, he simply can not command any prescense on stage and the band sounds horrible. Basically no ambiance or charisma coming from this band. It's too bad since their music was ok on the recordings.",1379289600,5,384,4.5
