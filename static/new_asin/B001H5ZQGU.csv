8307929,5,B001H5ZQGU,I bought this because Shannon Larkin is my favorite drummer he may not be the best drummer but he is awesome to watch play he has a style that is like Angus Young on the drums. This dvd is great he shows you a lot about his technique  and his equipment he uses. The only thing I wish this had was more songs he used I think this DVD only goes over 2 or 3 songs but he does go in a lot of depth with them.,1352332800,,404,3.6436781609195403
8307930,3,B001H5ZQGU,"""Behind the Player: Shannon Larkin"" DVD is excellent. Mr Larkin has influenced my drumming for years and this video is awesome.  The player in my laptop pc will not play it - the first DVD I've not been able to play here.  However, it plays ok in conventional DVD players.",1331769600,,272,4.42
8307931,5,B001H5ZQGU,My husband and son are both drummers. They both loved the video. My son is just learning to play. My husband has been playing for many years. They both benefitted from the video. My husband loves Shannon's hard hitting style and my son thinks Godsmack is the best (like his mom)!,1238112000,,279,4.490196078431373
