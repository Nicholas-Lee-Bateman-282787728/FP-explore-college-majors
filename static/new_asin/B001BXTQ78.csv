8285206,1,B001BXTQ78,"While the content might be interesting (even though the book also lacks citations to back up its content), this DVD surely is not. It is a recording of a lecture-like presentation from an annual meeting, presenting the viewer basically with a one hour long close up of Prof. Roughgarden. The presentation itself is not structured perfectly so that, even being used to listening to academic lectures, it is strenuous to follow the talk. There are a few slides cut into the video. The end result is a rather tiresome lecture by a lacturer who often seems uninvolved. A continuous use of slides might have helped to achieve a better structure of the content and to help keep the audience alive.
The DVD itself looks ""home-made"", which is no per se a disadvantage, however I had expected something else.
The overall quality of the product is just bad. The ""Q&A"" session on the DVD is practically useless because only the answers can be heard.
I cannot recommend buying this DVD.",1432080000,,974,4.769230769230769
8285207,5,B001BXTQ78,"I was looking for a DVD I saw on Logo recently about homosexuality in animals and came across this; just one of those happy accidents.

This is a DVD copy of a 2007 keynote lecture by Professor Joan Roughgarden of Stanford University called ""Sexual Diversity in the Animal Kingdom.""  The ground-breaking lecture takes on Darwin's natural selection theories and discusses sexual diversity in the animal kingdom, including homosexuality in domestic animals and humans. There's no fancy bells and whistles with this DVD; it's just a straightforward lecture, recorded for posterity and available here for purchase.

This lecture draws upon a range of animal studies to illustrate theories on sexual diversity in nature, which have previously been cast aside.  At times, science has turned a blind eye to difficult subjects which have later been proven true -- the Earth is indeed round, and so too, is homosexuality in nature a fact of life. And thankfully, scientific facts are no longer being dismissed due to personal bias; reputable science doesn't work that way. In fact, in 2006, the Natural History Museum at the University of Oslo, in Norway, presented a 'first of its kind' exhibit titled, Against Nature, which focused on homosexuality in animals.  The show was a huge success, and frequented by school groups and families.

This DVD is somewhat of a complement to Professor Joan Roughgarden's groundbreaking book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution-s-Rainbow-Diversity-Gender-and-Sexuality-in-Nature-and-People/dp/0520260120/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People.</a>&nbsp;It's a fascinating read, and nice companion piece to this fascinating documentary lecture, in which Roughgarden offers some brilliant insights.  Very interesting indeed.  Highly recommend this DVD!

Bottom Line - The point of this work, at least in part, is that we were born this way.  Beyond that, I'd add that homosexuality is more than just a sex act. It's something inherent in your being.

Aside - I'd love to see a companion piece to this that studies how many homophobic bigoted people are actually closeted self-loathing gays, projecting their disdain for themselves onto others.  Now that's science worth funding.  Lookout Washington!  Hmmmm... come to think of it, there IS a documentary like that:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outrage/dp/B0027BOL4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outrage</a>.  But an actual thesis might be interesting too.",1361059200,,2588,6.071428571428571
8285208,5,B001BXTQ78,"This lecturer provokes the audience to reconsider the sexual diversities in the animal kingdom, which were previously swept under the carpet, since they didn't fit a proposed model, theory, or religious doctrine. Dr. Roughgarden makes sense of these previously ignored pieces of the puzzle of biological life and sexuality. Fascinating. Highly recommended for biologists, social scientists and the thinking person in general.",1219536000,2,425,5.870967741935484
8285209,5,B001BXTQ78,"This DVD is very informative and delves deeply and objectively into the diversity of sexuality in the animal world.  It is thoughtful, though-provoking and provides insight into the way animals live that you might not obtain from mainstream shows.  Highly recommended.",1219536000,2,268,5.512195121951219
