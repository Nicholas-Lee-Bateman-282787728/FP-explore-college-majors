797030,5,6304168764,This is perhaps my favorite Peanuts movie...It should be classic and the fact that it is not available on Dvd is perplexing...by far the best peanuts movie ever!!,1095552000,22,162,4.821428571428571
797031,5,6304168764,"When you are a little kid, you are in the movie .This movie was so intriguing because there were no other people but the gang. It was very scary and I think this will capture the imagination of everyone. I love that they are like adults as children. I felt as if I was seeing a naughty pleasure but somehow managed to be ok. It still sticks to me like my first mystery favorite. The Rum and coca cola song playing on the jukebox during snoopy's drunken scene is a great part of movie comedy!! What a great movie! You and your kids are going to France!",1061424000,13,551,4.158878504672897
797032,5,6304168764,"This was one of my favorite movies when I was a little girl!  Immediately after I saw it for the first time, I wanted to learn how to speak French ... which I eventually did.  I still have the old tape off the TV that my mom made all those years ago.  I really ought to buy a proper copy of it.  :-P
What I like best about it is it's something both kids & adults can enjoy.  Everything Snoopy does in this movie is an absolute riot!  I love the whole spiel at the bakery, too. (""Loaf du bread see voo play!  Mare see!"")  And of course, I love the fact that Pierre liked Marcie better than that snot Peppermint Patty!  ;-)  muha!",1054080000,8,628,3.9919354838709675

797036,4,6304168764,"In all 4 of the full-length Peanuts movies, somebody is going somewhere. In this final full-length feature, Charlie Brown, Linus, Peppermint Patty, and Marcy win a contest at school and are awarded a trip to Europe as exchange students (somehow Snoopy and Woodstock wind up on the adventure). The title comes from a line Lucy jealously utters to Charlie Brown (""Bon voyage and don't come back!""- she stays at home).  This is possibly the first time adult voices are used (the flight stewardess has an audible voice instead of the trademarked ""whomp whomp waw"" voice).
In England, Snoopy plays tennis at Wimbledon. Then the gang winds up in France at a mysterious chateau whose name makes everybody shudder and Charlie finds out mysteries about his ancestors (we see a picture of his grandfather who had more hair than Chuck!). Peppermint Patty and Marcy compete for Pierre's attention but Pierre seems to prefer Marcy. There's a running gag about the windup car which Snoopy drives and Charlie Brown winds up the engine for the crazy beagle, injuring his hand every time! Other funny scenes include Charlie Brown's baguette incidents and Peppermint Patty nagging Chuck to death in the exchange classroom (""Don't lick the pages with your fingers and don't hassle me with your sighs, Chuck!"").  Of course, Chuck is pushed too far and distrupts the class- ""WILL YOU STOP CRITICIZING ME?!""
The story continues with the half-hour TV special What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?, which came out 3 years later.",1003622400,31,1503,5.008

Wonderful!",1457913600,2,309,5.078431372549019
797408,5,6304168764,"To date my favorite Peanuts movie (aside from the holiday specials). Apparently some of the places and occurrences are from Charles Schulz' own experiences in WWII. There is a sequel to this movie titled ""What Have We Learned Charlie Brown?"" which is also very good, and sort of completes the adventure to Europe that the gang takes. This story is much better than your average Peanuts movie/special because it doesn't just take place at ""home"" and isn't filled with different takes on the usual antics. They actually travel to Europe and have adventures somewhere else, which adds a much richer storyline.

Now that I have seen both, I'd recommend seeing them in succession to get the best experience.",1457654400,,702,4.9491525423728815

797633,1,6304168764,"Let me begin by saying that I haven't bought or viewed this DVD yet personally.  I have read the reviews of others and I do find the ""Its cropped statement"" disturbing.  I would would also like to say that I own this film on Laserdisc so I have had it on a digital format for quite some time.  I just recently saw this DVD for sale at the local Sam's club and was excited by its release.  So I picked it up and was immediately livid when I saw the bonus cartoon.  Normally a free cartoon would be a non issue.  And with most Peanuts cartoons, it would get a pass on whatever they chose to include.  But for those of you that might not know or realize it.  Bon Voyage is incomplete.  Yes, the movie was initially released in 1980, and it was good.  But on memorial Day, in 1983, CBS showed Bon Voyage......and immediately followed it by ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"" and the two together were fantastic.  This was a special made specifically to be tacked onto  the end of the movie  and was to be aired together as a special for Memorial Day.  Although, I can't tell you how many times it aired that way, that is the way I initially saw the movie and was thoroughly impressed.  So when I acquired the Laserdisc years later, imagine my shock  when the poignant ending that I remembered so well was MIA.  So after researching a bit, I found a VHS of ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"" and I knew that is what was missing.  Short story long, not making"" What Have We Learned. Charlie Brown""  as the bonus cartoon or even including it at all is no less than a travesty to this fine film and it truly makes it a full length feature film.  The two together would be right around 105 minutes.  Anyways, if you really want to see this film in its entirety, pick up ""Peanuts: The EMMY Honored Collection"".  I plan on picking it up in the very near future.  Its just such a waste that this movie didn't package these two together as CBS, and Charles Schultz intended.  Ergo, the one star.",1447200000,2,1988,4.282258064516129
797634,4,6304168764,This is one of my favorite movies in the Peanuts series. It shows Snoopy at his imaginary best. The setting of exchange students in France was different from the usual Peanuts themes.,1447200000,,183,4.75

797768,5,6304168764,"They finally got it right this time with ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"" The DVD release for this film not only has great picture and sound quality, but also has two Special Features, the best one being ""Travels with Charlie: The Making of Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"" for the film's 35th Anniversary. Here they explain how and why the film was made, also we get to learn a few things about how much Peanuts creator, Charles Schultz, had faith in Bill Melendez the Director of the film with whom he had been working with since the first Peanuts TV Special and the other Feature Films before. Of course the film Theatrical Trailer is also added on here as well. Why I like this film? Well not only is it a Peanuts film, but because it took Charlie Brown, Linus, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, Marcie and of course Woodstock out of their typical element of being at Home, School and the Baseball field and placed them in a Foreign Exchange program so they could see what it was like to live and go to School in France for two weeks. Also a breath of fresh air was no Lucy on this adventure, her bossiness and rude manor was not missed here, even though when saying Goodbye to Charlie Brown she shouts ""And don't come back!"" (the film's tag line) we see her, but that's it. Her loss is Peppermint Patty's gain, granted she too can be a torn in Charlie Brown's side, but she can be very comical where as Lucy is just plain mean. Having Marcie around is always a breath of fresh air for me because she is never mean to Charlie and helps the other Kids out in France with her gift of being fluent in French, plus I like how she has a crush on the French boy, Pierre with whom her and Peppermint Patty stay with while in France.

I also like the other theme to this film is the mystery and romantic story with Violet Honfleur who invites Charlie Brown to stay with her and her Uncle, The Baron Honfleur at her Home in France, the Chateau du Mal Voisin,  (The House of the Bad Neighbor). This part of the story always was the best part of the film as you see the mixed emotions Charlie Brown and his friends go through over the mystery surrounding the invite from Violet when her Uncle forbids strangers to the Chateau, especially Americans. I always felt this 4th film in the Peanuts films was one of the best ones hands down, with a great storyline, good music and the artwork is breathtaking. With the backgrounds and scenery of England and France, it makes you feel like you are there with the Peanuts gang. I just wished that besides the mini sequel to the film, the TV Special ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"", they had Violet and Pierre return by having them come to visit in America as either another film or TV special, that I would have loved to have seen especially having Charlie Brown and Violet rekindle a mini romance with each other. The DVD release of this film is well worth it.",1445040000,,2882,4.385046728971963
797769,5,6304168764,Great Item . Thank you.,1444780800,,23,3.8
797880,4,6304168764,"I am super excited to finally be able to own my favorite Peanuts movie on DVD. ""Bon Voyage Charlie Brown"" was one of a handful of animated films I grew up with as a kid that stayed with me through the years. As a child ther was a since of adventure in this film as France seemed like this strange and exotic country far away and it seemed so grown up for Charlie Brown and his friends to travel by themselves.

The film is a fun story although slightly darker in tone where Charlie Brown,  Linus, Peppermint Patty and Marcie are selected to be foreign exchange students in France. Of course Snoopy and woodstock join them as the gang stops by England before traveling to the French countryside. It's here that Charlie Brown and Linus travel to Chateau of the Bad Neighbor and the mystery begins to unfold.

The film looks gorgeous and is a treat to watch. I would have liked the DVD to also include the quasi sequel ""what have we learned Charlie Brown?"" Which tells the story of the children's trip home from France and their learning about D-Day. This special is included in the peanuts Emmy honored collection but would have also made sense on this DVD also.

Overall this is a fun story and I am grateful to add it to my collection.",1444435200,3,1235,4.4035087719298245
797881,5,6304168764,"I am so happy that ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"" has finally been released on DVD! It's one of my favorite Peanuts theatrical movies (along with ""Snoopy, Come Home""), and is also one of my all-time favorite Peanuts animated productions of any sort. I've grown up with this movie since I was little, from an old recorded HBO airing of the film on VHS, and subsequent airings on HBO and Cartoon Network during my childhood.

It's also not your usual Peanuts cartoon. There's adventure, mystery, suspense, even danger. The music is not your usual Peanuts sound (as Vince Guaraldi had died four years prior to this film), but it's a great score nonetheless. When the gang is in Europe, the background artwork is really beautiful and detailed. There's also a great, epic fire scene at one point in the film that I won't go into details about. And (horrors!) they actually show adults in full view, speaking normally (instead of the usual ""wa-wa-wa"" stuff!)

I bought this DVD the day it came out, and when I put it on, it was a full trip down memory lane. The picture quality is excellent, there's minimal film artifacts, and the colors look pretty good. The visuals are crisp and clear. Even the soundtrack, though in its' original mono, is a little clearer now. All the songs are intact (as some airings of the film on TV replaced the songs in the cafe scenes with new instrumental music due to music rights, not so here.) The film is just as I remembered it, only now it looks better. Though it was originally filmed in full-frame, then cropped into ""matted"" widescreen for theatrical release and this DVD (no surprise, as the DVDs of the prior three Peanuts animated films do the same thing too.)

The theatrical trailer was also neat to see. I also saw some of the included ""making of"" featurette, and so far it's pretty neat. (This is interesting, as the prior three Peanuts films do not have special features on their DVD releases.)

My prayers have been answered.  It's not in blu-ray, but beggars can't be choosers.  If it is released in blu-ray later, I will buy that too.  I actually bought two copies of this pre-release.  It is my favorite Peanuts movie.  If you haven't seen it, just buy it, you won't regret it.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!",1438387200,2,488,4.517241379310345

798034,5,6304168764,My favorite of all the Peanuts movies; this one is spectacular. Shulz lost his mother and was drafted the same day; his travels through France were the inspiration for this movie. From the gang's excited travel plans (CB to meet his female pen pal) to the jet ride (Woodstock comes to grief in the ashtray but Snoopy saves him) to the arrival (with Snoopy driving the rental car!) in France it is pure delight. CB's pen pal generously offered her family farmhouse for them to stay but they found out her father did not want them there. And watch for Snoopy having his own fanciful drama! The gang saves the day (you'll have to watch to see how) and all ends well.,1438041600,8,663,4.442622950819672

798140,5,6304168764,"Followed by Race for your Life, Charlie Brown (1977), this heavily critisized, classic 1980 Peanuts full length adventure is probably the best of the lot.  Perhaps some of the critizism is true, but still, the film is tons of fun.  The story is endearing, memorable, the music is cool, the characters are classic and adorable and the feel is creepy, yet absolutely wonderful.  This is darker than all previous Peanuts films, but not as depressing as A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) or Snoopy Come Home (1972).

The story begins when a little French girl named Violet sends Charlie Brown a letter inviting him to come visit her old chateau in the French countryside.  Coincidentally, that's when both Charlie Brown and Linus are invited to be part of a student exchange program that will take them over to Europe, Snoopy and Woodstock come along as well.  At another school nearby, Peppermint Patty and Marcie are also taking part in the same student exchange program, so the group of six travels together.  Once there, Peppermint Patty and Marcie are welcomed in the home of a little farm boy named Pierre, while Linus and Charlie Brown are surprised to find that when they arrived at the Chateau of the Mal Voisin, there's nobody there to greet them and they soon enroll in a mystery in which some history of the Brown family will be revealed!

What made this film so much fun was the whole atmosphere of it, it wasn't at all like previous Peanuts films, this one was much gloomier and slower, but super fun.  A lof of scenes are plain hilarious, such as a scene which has Peppermint Patty attend school at the French schoolhouse and Snoopy's visits to an old tavern.  The whole journey to Europe is wonderful, I love every second of it, it brings me a lot of memories of when I first watched the film, the nicest part here being the soft and sweet song ""I Want to Remember This.""  This film was quite creepy and gloomy, I thought, and it did break a lof of classic Peanuts themes such as adults actually speaking and Marcie's calling Charlie Brown ""Chuck"" instead of ""Charles,"" not to mention Charlie Brown actually receiving a letter.

Both A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) and Snoopy Come Home (1972) have greenlit DVD releases coming up soon, so why aren't Race for your life, Charlie Brown (1977) and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and don't come back!) (1980) seeing a DVD edition soon as well?",1140739200,48,2398,4.656398104265403
798141,1,6304168764,"I decided to watch this movie on HBO-Family recently, since it was the only one of the four I hadn't seen yet.  And I have to say, it's the worst of the bunch.

The timing was slower than usual, and several scenes drag on and on forever, such as Snoopy's bar scenes and Peppermint Patty's misconception that Pierre has a crush on her.  There are also several fades to black, which cause me to wonder if this was made for TV.  And the one song in the middle is hardly even memorable - it doesn't move the story any further, and comes at an inappropriate moment.

And the voice acting.  OH! what an atrocity.  In the old days it was believable.  Now it's gotten worse.  I've heard better (real) kid voices on Sesame Street.  In order to make an impression on an audience, you've got to EMOTE, not just read sentences on paper.

It's no wonder the CB & Snoopy Show came after this - Schulz must have decided to stick to recycling comic strip ideas.  Yet, there's only one series of strips I can clearly remember that was adapted here: the scene where Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty have to share a desk.  Since I knew exactly where each strip began and ended, that made it a lot less funny.

This product seems rushed, hastily done, and unclear in its purpose (really, what HAVE we learned, Charlie Brown?)  It leaves you yearning for one of the '64-'72 specials.  Avoid it at all costs unless you want to laugh at how bad it is.",1138406400,4,1430,4.359848484848484
798142,5,6304168764,"When you think of Charlie Brown movies, you think of the Christmas Special or the Pumpkin King short films.  There are also those often cheaply produced full-length films that were probably made for television as were the holiday vareity.  However, ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown"" outclasses any other Chalie Brown movie you will come across.  The plot is well scripted, the music is awesome, and the animation precise.  Just from viewing this piece you can tell a sizeable amount of time and energy went into this film to make it as good as it is.  The jokes are funny (unlike many Peanuts films), and the gang's adventure to France is riveting.  Is is truely a shame that Paramount has still not released this classic film out on DVD.",1096848000,31,732,4.724409448818897
