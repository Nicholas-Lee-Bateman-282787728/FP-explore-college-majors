8289437,5,B001CU7SHA,"Excellent biography and photos of the early 20th century.  Very interesting to see the beautiful homes that they lived in, pictures of the school where they attended, the cars that they drove, and the way that they dressed at that time in our history.  Also, very interesting was the film footage on discovering the body, the trial, and the prisoner who murdered Richard Loeb.  The coverage of what happened to Nathan Leopold after that was very interesting.  The closing postlude was beautiful, too.",1401148800,,500,4.9879518072289155
8289438,5,B001CU7SHA,"Leopold and Leob is a timeless mystery. Why these two did what they did is the question no one can answer. But as we see this tragedy repeated time and again, we must try.",1395360000,,171,4.0588235294117645
8289439,5,B001CU7SHA,"One of the best documentaries on Leopold & Loeb I have ever seen.  Very comprehensive and informative. There are many programs on things that happened in the 20th century but many seem to forget this crime. This documentary will stay with you long after you are done viewing it.

Clarence Darrow is known for giving one of the most emotional and powerful (not to mention lengthy, at almost 12 HRS long) closing ""statements"" in history, pleading the sparing of the death penalty for his two rich clients; he got it.",1300147200,,514,4.7
8289440,4,B001CU7SHA,"I purchased this DVD after finishing the book ""Crime of the Century"" by Hal Higdon.  My one and and only complaint with the book is there were no photo sections included.  For me, this made it difficult to visualize the ""characters"".  In buying the DVD I was hoping to get a better picture of Leopold and Loeb as well as Bobby Franks and the families of all 3 boys.  I definitely got that!  The DVD started with a brief set up describing Chicago of the 1920's and the Kenwood neighborhood where all 3 boys lived.  It spent a fair amount of time discussing the crime itself, the trial and Leopold and Loeb's lives after sentencing.  I especially liked that they used very little reenactments but focused more on interviews with Hal Higdon and others. It was very interesting to hear from the boy (now an elderly man) who was considered as a victim before Bobby Franks was chosen.  These interviews were mingled heavily with photographs of the principals as well as locations as they appeared in that era.  After purchasing, but before receiving, the DVD I found that it is on youtube in its entirety.  As with similar youtube videos, it is broken into 4 parts and the video quality is poor.  I watched it and the DVD when it arrived and I'm glad that I bought the DVD.",1266019200,6,1267,4.489082969432315
