1645929,1,B00005QAP6,"I love Steven Segal movies. I love Dennis Hopper movies.  I always go for the new action movies first. I watch a lot of movies and this is worst one I have ever seen.  It's worse than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  It's even worse than ""Tomcats"". The direction is so bad film students could learn from this movie.  It has examples of poorly directed actors, bad camera positions, bad storyboarding, badly hacked together sceens, and the most boring climax I have ever seen in an action movie.
The script had potential, it could have been no worse than than Segal's ""The Patriot"".  I can see how the big names got involved.  What I don't understand is why the producer didn't fire the director after the first day of shooting.  They both must have been on drugs.
Even stranger yet I think Steven Segal gave one of his best acting perfomances, maybe he just seem good in comparision.
But the fight scenes were sad, so badly hacked up in editing you couldn't tell who was hitting who.
Sensei Segal, whoever made this movie is not your friend. Please don't them use you like this again.",1012089600,5,1079,4.5025641025641026
1645930,1,B00005QAP6,"First things first. Director Albert Pyun has made many low-grade actioners in his time. Some are pretty good (NEMESIS, KICKBOXER 2, MEAN GUNS) and some are pretty terrible (CRAZY SIX, OMEGA DOOM, THE WRECKING CREW). His strength as a technical action director is flawless; (witness the hyper-kinetic stuntwork in NEMESIS) but the ability to tell a coherent and engaging story is obviously beyond him. Which at that note, brings us to his latest epic - TICKER.
When first announced, the cast list for this direct-to-video opus was very strange to say the least. How had Pyun managed to convince all of these major stars (Steven Seagal, Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper) to appear in a movie that looked like it cost a buck ninety-five? His track record of B-movie dreck had obviously eluded all of them, or were they just paid top dollar and didn't care? Either way, the finished product is a waste of an audiences time and a major low point in each of the casts acting career. Sizemore stars as a cop on the edge (aren't they all?) suffering the trauma of losing his wife and child in a bomb blast. He now has to keep it together to foil a mad bomber who is blowing up sections of San Francisco. Essaying the role of the mad bomber is Rent-a-loon Dennis Hopper; who sleepwalks through his (SPEED-ALIKE) role. Coming to save the day as Sizemores partner is Steven Seagal, who apears as a Zen-like bomb disposal expert. Male bonding and macho action(less) scenes combine to ensue Seagal helps Sizemore come to terms with the loss of his wife. The script is so lazy and dull, the direction so lifeless, that no matter how hard Sizemore tries (and boy, does he try to rise above the material) he fails to emote any emotion or anger. The obvious inner turmoil of his character isn't fully explored, as director Pyun seems to be interested in presenting the most boring action film known to man. Sizemore's character should have been more akin to that of Mel Gibson's in LETHAL WEAPON - all angst ridden and angry, but he comes across as a dull, sweaty cop stumbling around fake sets and avoiding terrible effects of bombs going off. Seagal is rarely used (which is strange, because if you were a low budget action director and you managed to get Steven Seagal in your film - wouldn't you at least try to make the most of him?) and he only gets the chance to fight in a poorly edited finale that is shot at night, thus spoiling the chances of seeing Seagal doing any real damage. Infact, the entire cast look like they are acting in different movies altogether, with some acting as if they were in some kind of school play.
The disc is so-so. Artisan have presented this movie with a decent transfer, and yet again they grace us with a directors commentary. This is okay, as Pyun informs us that TICKER uses stock footage from over 90 different movies from the studios back catalogue. So, mistake spotters - look out for the scene where Sizemores' wife and child are killed, and then take a look at the recent (and far superior) Jean Claude Van Damme actioner REPLICANT to see that the footage comes from that exact movie! (I don't want to go on but you could write a novel on how many errors in continuity and the like that this movie has). The trailer is also added, but that ain't gonna make this a worthwhile purchase - buy EXIT WOUNDS instead.",1012003200,3,3340,4.559068219633944

Unfortunately, he blows up in a car from a chick that brought amusement to me from ""Desert Heat"". Nas makes a cameo, but gets second billing on the cover! Classic!

1645934,2,B00005QAP6,"Has Director Albert Pyun ever made a really good movie? Certainly ""Ticker"" ist one of his best, but it's far from a good movie. Okay, it's fun to watch this flick, but with a higher budget and a more talented director you could have made much, much more of it...
Tom Sizemore is a great actor with an ongoing career (Bringing out the Dead, Pearl Harbor ...) - what the hell let him play in this B-movie?! Dennis Hopper has played many flicks of this kind, so I wasn't surprised, but Steven Seagal fallows his comeback (""Exit Wounds"") with this disapointment...
The editing is terrible (you can tell that the explosions were edited in from other movies / the gunfighting during the showdown is edited so badly that you can't tell what's really going on). And I must say: I've never seen a bomb being defused so ... as at the end of ""Ticker""... a terrible, disapointing showdown!

1645987,1,B00005QAP6,"Maybe I'm being just the tiniest bit hard on ""Ticker"". Yes, I know that it was made on a meager $600,000 budget, but that doesn't excuse it for me. Yes, I know that filming time was limited to twelve days (no joke), but I can't look past it. And yes, I know that it was directed by the ultimate B-movie hack, Albert Pyun (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/6305232679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg/dp/0792835735/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg</a>)...but could he really have done no better for a man of his experience?

The story, in short:
San Francisco is plagued by the antics of a dangerous demolitions expert (Dennis Hopper,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed/dp/6305176299/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed</a>), pursued by Ray Nettles (Tom Sizemore, ""Saving Private Ryan"") - a vengeful detective looking to avenge the death of his partner (Nasir ""Nas"" Jones) - and the city's bomb squad, led by the Zen-practicing martial artist Frank Glass (Steven Seagal,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>). They must seize the criminal before his plot to rain destruction down on the entire city is realized.

For starters, even though this is a movie of diverse theatrical talent - including Jaime Pressly (""My Name is Earl"") as the bomber's girlfriend - the acting leaves very, very much to be desired: the fact that ""Mumbles"" Seagal gives a performance to cry about is a given, but not only does Sizemore lose his edge in between shouting at Nas and Pressly, but the usually-adamant Dennis Hopper features the most amazing disappearing accent. Yes, a disappearing accent - he's Irish in one scene, and not Irish in another. No rhyme or reason to it. I hate to say it, but no-name actress Linda Castro gives the best performance of the film as a schizophrenic homeless woman.

The film plays like an uninteresting thriller: the bomber plays cat & mouse with the police, blowing up things at will while Nettles runs around as clueless as a beheaded chicken and Glass spouts Zen nonsense from behind his desk. Other than the shooting of Nettles' partner (Nas is featured on the cover of the film, but his total screentime doesn't top five minutes), nothing really exciting happens until the end - no car chases, no sex scenes, and sparse shootouts. Even when we do get to the end, the only thing we're treated to is a silly gunfight and the two absolute worst hand-to-hand fights that Seagal has ever been involved in. Blah.

What decisively kills the movie for me, however, is that it seems so very small. The scale of the film pales in comparison to anything that the cast has done before, and makes it seem like most of the movie was shot in the parking lot behind the production building. Add to that the fact that the film liberally incorporates footage from the Dolph Lundgren movies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweepers/dp/6305669562/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweepers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Peacekeeper/dp/B0000203YZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Peacekeeper</a>, and what you're left with is a certified bomb, even where direct-to-video releases are concerned.

Luckily for Sizemore, he was immediately able to salvage his career with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down/dp/B000065U1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down</a>. Hopper and  Seagal, however, continue drift rather listlessly from project to project, with the latter's face not having seen the inside of a movie theater since the release of his following film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Half-Past-Dead/dp/B0000844MD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Half Past Dead</a>. While I don't contribute their ensuing lack of success to ""Ticker"", the movie best serves to show where the careers of these actors were headed at that time - nowhere.",1224892800,,4213,6.3954305799648505
1645988,2,B00005QAP6,"After Exit Wounds Success I was hoping to see Seagal doing another good theatrical film, instead he gives us this excuse for a movie. First of all Seagal does not play the main character here; Tom Sizemore takes the lead as an over the top cop. Secondly either Segal did this before Exit Wounds or he ate a lot of cheeseburgers to gain all the weight he had lost. Seriously I really wanted to see Segal continue the shape he had in Exit Wounds, instead he cheats us by playing a small role, that barely has screen time, and is usually sitting in a chair.

In this flick Tom Sizemore plays Ray Nettles, a cop on the edge, who is on the look for vengeance after his family was killed in an automobile explosion. He is on the look for any incident that matches what happened to his family. Shortly in the film we are introduce to Swann (Denis Hopper) a mad Terrorist of Irish decent..now there's the problem I cant accept that Dennis Hopper, a Kansas born actor playing an Irish; he did a good job in Speed for playing a similar part, makes sense why they chose him for the part, but why Irish. In the other hand one of Swan's men has a better Irish accent then him. Anyways, Sizemore finds Swann's girl and takes her into custody. He begins to question her on Swans motive and possible targets. She of course refuses to give any information, possibly due to fear of being killed by Swann. Sizemore's move now is to find the best bob squad in the business, and of course that'd be Mr. Puffy Face, Nappy Hair Seagal. Segal plays Glass, The leader of an elite Bob Squad. Glass and Nettles will join forces to stop these maniacs from killing hundreds or possibly thousands of civilians.

Seagal had very little interested in playing this part, you can obviously tell by his lack motivation in lines. The good thing the movie has is that Seagal's voice is not dubbed nor enhanced; and there aren't any doubles in the fights...but the fights are plain bad, there really is only one fight with Seagal, and its short, quick and too dark. This is really not worth neither owning nor renting. I guess you could wait for it to be shown on cable; the last time they gave it was on the USA network.

1645989,2,B00005QAP6,"One might feel they have to force themselves through an action film of this caliber.  The fact that it has such screen stars as Dennis Hopper and Tom Sizemore in it does not help much when the characters they play are shallow and pointless.  For an action film it is pretty bad in many areas, particularly the production, which has ""ATF"" agents with uniforms that look like they were bought at a farm store and had duct tape applied on the back for the Lettering.  Sizemore and Hopper do their best but it is not enough to save this film.  Seriously, if one is looking for an action film that covers the themes in here, there would be many better to pick from.

Ticker had potential with the plot but half the time the actors are given simple one-liners and minimal scenes to act out frustration or worry, further taking away any credibility one would have with the daunting situations they face.  Steven Seagal is almost meaningless in this movie, and although he had his fifteen seconds of fame early in his career, it seems everything he has done since then has been less than filler.",1188086400,,1087,4.520408163265306
1645990,1,B00005QAP6,"I watch this movie thinking it would another Speed type film, which is a compliment, but this was bad. Bad meaning why would anyone have big names like this and squander it with bad script and direction. Dennis was so unbelievable even trying to act like a lunatic bomber, if that is even possible given that he did such a wonderful job in Speed. Now i am a big Seagal fan but why is he moving his lips so much in this movie when he is not doing the dialog? Was that even intentional or he forgot his chapstick cause i can't even tell. There is some suspense so i'll give it that but it didn't hold my interest enough because at this point, i really didn't care.

When you watch this it seems like it could be a good movie, but it just does not make it.  Never seen a film with so many A/B list actors that was so poorly made.  Just sad really.....",1156636800,3,428,4.0843373493975905
1645992,1,B00005QAP6,"Okay, ignoring the obvious fact that Pyun made this... ""film""... out of the scum that stuck to his shoes after walking through the cutting rooms of 3 or 4 other really crappy movies - all involving... cityscapes and leather, I'd guess... Where was I... Oh yeah. And leaving aside the question of whether any of these actors has ever really been good (I love them all, you understand, but I also ""like"" Starbucks coffee when Kona isn't available - ie all the time except payday)... Um, I feel that what sums this hunk of celery up is that the bad guys ""hide"" a huge bomb on the roof of the San Francisco city hall, and then have a bunch of henchboobs ""guard"" it so's Hopper and Pressly can get out of range.

Now, let's recognize that city halls don't tower over every other building in any city on earth (this is reserved for the buildings of banks, insurance companies and general commercial piracy outfits). Which means authorities would be able to see the spear carriers guarding the bomb and act accordingly. This you could see in any bad movie. Perhaps not in the light of the feeling that some of the guards might wonder who would be guarding the bomb while it was their turn to get out of range, though. And how, really, do you sneak a bomb the size of an elephant onto the roof of a city hall. Even pre 9/11 my imagination failed.

But here's where I had to look under the bottom of the disc's case to see if somehow, something had fallen out of it. Can I really believe Ice-T would play a man stupid enough to attempt to take this roof by force? No ladies and gents, a bad movie can be the most fun you'll ever have with your clothes on, but this Ticker goes too far, crosses a line (trips over it actually), and stumbled into chaos. It was like having Korean subtitles on under a Cantonese audio track on a Mime film of about Ladan as told by Swedish Esperantists.

1645993,1,B00005QAP6,"'Ticker'...oh where to begin?

Usually I write pretty in-depth reviews about Lord Steven's films but with 'Ticker' I'm not even going to bother.  Here's the only way that I can explain this film:  take the laziest and most ineptly made film you've ever seen, take a dump on it, then throw it against a wall, and then wipe yourself with it.  That is 'Ticker'.

Lord Steven is nothing but supporting cast as a hippie bomb squad leader.  Tom Sizemore apparently took some time off from rehab or jail or wherever he was supposed to be to play the burnout cop.  Some various annoying rappers show up and are all killed off in a matter of seconds.  Dennis Hopper rolled out of bed to obviously just get an easy paycheck to play a mad bomber with no real agenda and throws in a constantly disappearing/reappearing terrible Irish accent just for kicks.  The director(Albert Pyun, auteur of other direct-to-video hunks of crap)must have been trying to one up crapmaster Uwe Boll for complete disregard for filmmaking.  Oh, and there must have been a sale of black leather jackets somewhere because every single character in this film wears one.  Every single person.  Even extras sport them.

'Ticker' is, by approximately five thousand times, the worst film Lord Steven has ever been in.  And that is saying something if you have seen other Seagal flicks such as 'Today You Die' or 'Out Of Reach'.

Pure, unadulterated fecal matter.  I'd rather burn my privates with cigarettes than watch this stinker again.",1135382400,5,1500,4.80078125

I bought it, sat down and watched it that evening and then put it directly into the bin. This for me is in the same league as Van Damme's terrible Derailed. How could Seagal allow himself not only to get involved in something like this but even allow his name to be exploited in supporting such rubbish especially after the excellent Exit Wounds. I like both Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper but they were even bad in this. Dennis Hopper replays his part from Speed only with a very bad Irish accent. What little martial arts scenes there are involving Seagal could actually be anyone. The lighting is so low that it is impossible to tell who is actually involved in the martial arts scenes. It could very well be two standin stunt actors. I also noticed that Seagal kept doing that strange motion with his lips all the way through the movie as if he had a bad case of gas and was letting a few off. It also becomes annoying throughout the movie when at times you see Seagal on screen but we don't get to see him say his lines. They seem to be done in voice over when the camera is on another actor. The same thing is also evident at the beginning of Out For A Kill. The only positive advice I can give is before you go ahead and buy this make sure you rent it first and then decide, as I wish I had done.",1107302400,4,1499,4.136986301369863

What Sizemore was doing associating himself with this brainless drivel is anyone's guess, but it is a pretty poor outing, even by Seagals recent standards. Interestingly this had a delayed release due to sensitivity around 9-11, but any expectations you mave have knowing that will soon evaporate. Trivia fans might look out for Seagal playing a disguised member of the live band in the ""Jazz Cat"" bar scene (nothing to do with the plot) as this is probably the high point of the flick. I think the script was doodled on some rough paper in a toilet somewhere, and in sure fire hollywood fashion somebody said ""Great idea for a movie"". On the plus side there is quite a bit of action, although Seagal is even more miserably stoic than usual, and you can't help feeling everyone is going through the motions, just to get a pay check. One diversion from the normal formula has Sizemore and NOT Seagal as the ""man with attitude"" after his family were wiped out by, you guessed it ......... a bomb. The credibility meter is in sub overdrive, and there are more cliches in this picture than explosions, so don't be too disappointed. Even the class of Dennis Hopper can't lift this out of mediocrity, and I have to advise even the staunchest of Seagal fans to to avoid this movie. Worse than Bad!",1094256000,3,1517,4.601476014760148

The Segal movies I have seen before, Segal was the main actor. It was a nice different seeing him share the spotlight of the movie with Tom Sizemore. Much of the action was what one would expect in a Segal movie, and I like that.

Dennis Hopper who was the bomber in Speed also is the bomber in this movie. His unique voice kept reminding me of that movie. The movie was halfway over or so before I could place him with this movie.

I was glad the movie had some unexpected twists to it as it began to come to the end of the storyline. I won't share those with you though as they are what makes this movie worth watching.

1646030,1,B00005QAP6,"The ""Ticker"" trailer included on the disc actually starts out with a serious sounding voice over saying, ""A cop on the edge...."" I couldn't believe a trailer would rely on an action film clich such as this one. A cop on the edge? Didn't that phrase exhaust itself sometime back in the early 1980s? Actually, the phrase fits director Albert Pyun's 2001 low budget action flick to a T, a flick so loaded with rote formulas we have seen before that it the rip-off factor boggles the mind. Did ""Ticker"" have a theatrical run? I doubt it. If it did, the box office take must have been minimal. No, this reeks of straight to video release. Come to think of it, I doubt an Albert Pyun film has had a theatrical run since he released ""The Sword and The Sorcerer"" back in the early 1980s. How this continues to work is beyond me. I've seen several of this hack's films before and sort of admire his unflinching reliance on standard clichs. It just goes to show you that you can have minimal talent and still have a somewhat successful career in the Hollywood B budget movie market. ""Ticker"" proves this truth.
The cop on the edge in ""Ticker"" is Ray Nettles (Tom Sizemore), a vice cop with an attitude carrying the horrific memories of witnessing his wife and child perish in an explosion. He spends most of his day hanging out with his partner Art ""Fuzzy"" Rice (Nas), busting women of the night in San Francisco's dirty slums. Just so we know what Nettles and Rice do all day, and presumably to tell us Sizemore's character isn't a bad guy, ""Ticker"" supplies with the obligatory scene of a bust where Rice and Nettles catch Lilly (Chilli of TLC fame) with a client. The two cops let her go rather than run her in yet again after she pleads with them to let her go for the sake of her kids (!). A few minutes later, Fuzzy takes the big fall in a gun battle with a trio of brutes in a warehouse. Nettles swears to avenge his partner's untimely demise despite interference from Captain Spano (Joe Spano) and an obnoxious underling who has it in for Nettles. Yep, you heard it right. The conflicts between Nettles and the department establish the classic ""cop on the edge"" theme. Locked out of the investigation, Ray only has Claire (Jaime Pressly), a girl brought in because of the warehouse shooting, as a possible way to keep his hand in the case. He subsequently turns to the bomb squad for help.
The bomb squad in ""Ticker"" is a bunch of guys who work outside the normal police channels. Led by Glass (Steven Seagal), an expert on every sort of military and non-military explosive, the crew is a goofy bunch of smart alecks with little time to deal with the rest of the department. They treat Ray Nettles like he's dirt under their shoes-which he is to some extent, or at least he looks like he is-but decides to take the detective under their wing when he shows them an explosive device he found in the warehouse shooting. Seagal finds the break he's been looking for: a series of bombings in the city have flummoxed the higher ups, but with this new evidence Glass and his crew begin to put the pieces together. Turns out Claire has information on a guy named Swann (Dennis Hopper), an Irish terrorist and one of the premier bomb makers in the world. Swann isn't happy about Claire hiding in the police station, so he starts a new campaign of bombings in order to free her. She's got some secrets about his operation and what he's ultimately planning, secrets Glass and his pals would like to learn so they can capture the guy. Eventually, the cops let Claire go so they can trick Swann into coming in, but things go horribly wrong and she gets away. Witness the exciting (yawn) plot twist that follows. The movie wraps up with Seagal and Sizemore working together to bring down the baddies.
""Ticker"" should rightly be classified as a disaster movie because that's exactly what it is. The script, acting, action scenes, and plot are terrible. Seagal always strikes wooden poses and delivers lines you'd find in a fortune cookie like he has a mouth full of lead, so picking on him isn't too original. Dennis Hopper, on the other hand, should have known better. Not only does he sport the worst Irish accent ever captured on film, his performance is uninspiring. Does Hopper need a paycheck this badly? Heck, I'd loan him some money if he's this desperate for cash because I hate to see a good actor hit the skids. Perhaps it's not the performers' fault since Pyun's uninspired cinematography and pacing virtually insured the film would tank. This director, at least with this picture, subscribes to the ""tell don't show"" school of film. We don't even get to see most of the explosions, just someone walking around in the wreckage afterwards. Worse, the booms we do see are shot in such extreme close-ups that you soon realize Pyun didn't have a decent budget to lens shock and awe type pyrotechnics.
Extras on the DVD include the aforementioned ""cop on the edge"" trailer, production notes, cast and crew biographies, and a few other goodies of questionable interest. This is one of the few films I have seen lately where I actually wished the picture transfer wouldn't be that good. ""Ticker"" might well classify as the worst action film made in the last ten years. If that interests you, and it should if you like bad films, go ahead and give it a shot. All others need to steer clear.",1086307200,3,5377,4.555785123966942

The company that has developed the movie is committing a huge crime of false advertising.  Be prepared to see numerous 10 to 15 second cameo appearances from music superstars and actors.

1646033,5,B00005QAP6,"Ticker is such a jaw-droppingly awful film that the five star rating is to HIGHLY recommended it for Seagal fans who must see what a shell of his former self the big man has become.
Ticker got a straight-to-DVD release in 2001 for a couple of glaring reasons:
1) it's absolutely one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory, and yes, I do like Seagal movies for what they are
2) after 9/11 this movie must have looked like one of the worst decisions anyone involved with it could have made
To sum up--Sizemore is a cop on the edge, Seagal works in the bomb squad, and Dennis Hopper is an ex-IRA mad bomber terrorist who is blowing up San Francisco because...I don't remember, really.  After 9/11 the mad bomber/terrorist story line made Ticker about as bankable as a Howard the Duck sequel.  And, of course, the film is appalling.
Where to begin?  I wasn't expecting much.  Just a bad B-movie with enough action to while away 90 minutes or so.  Between Seagal, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Hopper, Peter Greene, and Nas all showing up, how bad could it be?
Bad.  The film is literally so incoherent that I had difficulty following what was going on in whole sequences.  There are gun battles where everyone looks the same, everyone is shooting, and you can't follow the action.  The editing is so bad that the film often resembles a series of scenes just spliced together.  A bomb is being disabled in one place, and then there's an explosion in another, and then someone is walking around somewhere, we don't know where.  The police station is filmed from the same angle over and over, suggesting that if someone stepped the wrong day the set wall would come crashing down.  The acting is laughable, as if everyone was equally embarrassed to be involved.  Dennis Hopper's Irish accent (which disappears and then reappears in true bad-film-accent-style) is amusing, as are the other Irish 'terrorists' (merely bad looking guys in black leather jackets).  Jamie Pressley, whose face looks like it
was warped by one of those computer programs, plays a terrorist.  Uh huh.  By the time Ice-T showed up for all of 15 seconds, I was convinced he just happened to be wandering by the set that day when they gave him a part.
Speaking of black leather jackets, it seems the entire cast got a cut rate deal on form-disguising wardrobes.  A very bloated Tom
Sizemore walks around the entire film in the same outfit.  It looks like he had a month between rehab stints or court appearances to make this film, and he phones in a performance that includes him screaming in his dying partner's face, ""Don't die!"" as well as screaming at witnesses to ""Tell me his name!""
Then there's Seagal.  You want to believe he can mount another comeback, but there's no chance.  You'd think that after Exit Wounds he would be back in the game.  Instead he's back on the Weight Gainer 2000, like he's gone from worshipping Buddha to trying to resemble him.  He's enormous in this film, clad in black, his hairline disappearing, his dialogue (and bizarre accent) as laughable as any he's done, and then some.  He spends most of the film sitting down, filmed like Brando in Apocalypse Now to hide his appearance.  By the time he hoists his bulk out of a chair, his fight scenes are once again filmed in almost total darkness so we have no idea what's going on.  We see hands moving, limbs flying, Seagal's face a mask of constipation, all to hide the fact that he is completely incapable of doing any stunt work or anything resembling a convincing fight scene.  Matter of fact, I have no doubt that Seagal's contract stipulates that he cannot be photographed to look as fat as he really is or that he can't actually exert himself beyond reciting Zen nonsense while someone is trying to disarm a bomb.  The man is an embarrassment, but the fact that he goes on with the charade lends him a certain charm.  I will continue to watch his movies with the morbid curiosity of someone who wants to see just how bad things can get.
The amazing part is that 99% of the people watching Ticker will know more about police procedure, terrorism, and film making than the people behind this movie.  Some kind of credit must be given for the total disregard of anything resembling quality that went into it.
Seagal is determined to play up his bad boy, mysterious man with a mysterious past, Zen spouting, tough guy persona to the bitter end, so why not tune in for a good laugh?  He has at least one classic bit where he actually kicks the bumper of a car hard enough to deploy an airbag, a scene I had to rewind because I was laughing so hard.
I could go on and on, that's how bad the whole affair is.  Ticker is, in my humble opinion, Seagal's worst hour.  And given such efforts as Half Past Dead and The Patriot, that is saying something.  Don't let anyone in the cast fool you--it's bad.  It's bad-TV-movie bad.",1059004800,40,4871,4.555683122847302
1646034,2,B00005QAP6,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers here,this is not that good a movie. Dennis Hopper'S accent does change from irish to american constantly, Tom sizemore looks like he can't really be bothered allthough he is usually a good action actor,and  Steven Seagals fights are to brief and in the dark so you cant see what is going on,but he does seem fairly convincing as a bomb disposal expert. The action is weird,some of the scenes look like they are fairly well shot and others look like some bad tv movie standard. There are bits when you think its going to get better,but then it fails again. I knew it was bad when tom sizemore's cop partner gets killed at the start,when he gets shot there is not a drop of blood to be seen,very unrealistic. Shame because the actors involved could have made it a good actioner. Seagal's earlier work such as Marked for death and nico trample all over this effort.

1646040,1,B00005QAP6,"As many reviewers have said rightly, ""Ticker"" is a bomb.  Real Bomb.  Big Bomb.  And Steven Seagal plays the leader of a bomb squad.
For all not-so-bad cast of Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore, Jamie Pressly, and Peter Greene, the film doesn't know how to tell a story.  Okay, actions temselves are so-so, but no tension, no exciting feeling comes from them.  As I was watching it in theater in Japan (yeah, I went to a theater all the way) in May, 2001, the guy behind my seat actually said, ""Man, during that gun-shooting scene at the climax, I couldn't tell which side is which!...  Which was the bad side, anyway?""  That kind of complaint.  Yes, because of poor editing and awful staging of the action sequences, everything looks confused and disjointed.  And with this cast.  What a waste.
SO, I tell you something else.  As if reflecting the trend of the recent movie industry in Hollywood, ""Ticker"" shows many faces from music industry.  We have seen Whitney and Maria.  We have DMX in ""Exit Wounds.""  And now in ""Ticker"" we have NAS (Nasir Jones) as a cop and Chilli (Rozonda Thomas) from TLC.  Plus, veteran guitarist Clarence ""Gatemouth""  Brown can be seen playing; and in the same jazz bar scene, you can see a glimpse of Billy Preston, who played the keyboard in the legendary ""Let It Be"" session of the Beatles.  And as a terrorist commander, Ice-T shows up briefly ... what kind of casting is this!  AND finally, while the ending credit rolls up, you can hear a blues song called ""Love Doctor"" whose lead vocal sounds very, very familiar to you.
