3053510,5,B0010X742S,"This is a good video for young children, and it is generally very affordable. My wife and I originally bought it a few years ago for our first daughter. We purchased it again for our second daughter (original DVD got damaged). It was nice to see it again. The episodes are short. They begin and end the same way. It gets the kids into a routine and works great for naps. It gets the kids to burn a little extra energy and then lay down.",1357084800,,436,4.141176470588236

3053512,5,B0010X742S,"My 3 year old has loved this since she was 1.  It is a video not to be watched but danced and played to.  We dance along with the children on the video and the bunnies in the video give it an Easter feel if you are looking for something age appropriate for that holiday.  The songs, however, are not holiday songs, but about things like eating a good super etc...  I suggest this for ages 1-3 (but who knows, my oldest may be liking it until she is 6).  Enjoy.",1302825600,3,460,4.010989010989011

8239074,5,B0010X742S,My son used to borrow this from the library and this was the only place I found it for him. He loves this DVD so much.,1515369600,,118,3.576923076923077
8239075,5,B0010X742S,Absolutely love this video. Watch it with my granddaughter everyday. She loves it to. She watches the whole thing. This video taught her to wave hello and good bye,1502928000,,163,4.655172413793103
8239076,4,B0010X742S,Cute movie. My 17 month old isn't too interested in it yet.,1451174400,,59,4.0
8239077,5,B0010X742S,"My daughter loves this video even if it drives me crazy. She watched it non stop for days until she broke the copy we had by pretending to nurse it. Not a joke, she literally tried to nurse the disc as if it were a baby. After that she screamed for days until we bought another copy. Lesson learned, if you child loves something, always have a spare on hand.",1424736000,,358,4.128571428571429
8239078,4,B0010X742S,"This is a cute dvd meant for babies, but if you are a family who is against screen time until after a year or two, this dvd can still be pretty enjoyable for your child. We did not allow television of any kind until after our daughter's first year, and we discovered this dvd after she had turned 3 and she still loves it. Though, I think she enjoys this for the songs and the rabbit puppet only.

This dvd is meant to be used to encourage parents to play with their children and help them learn through play. This is not the type of dvd to plop your kid down in front of the tv with and walk off. It would be helpful to watch the dvd on your own first and then before watching it with your child, gather up materials around your house for your child to play with while watching the dvd. Like for the 'music in the house' segment, grab pots and pans and spoons for your baby to use while watching the babies in the dvd.

Each segment is divided into a 15 minute ""playdate"" with a Bunny, Mouse, and Pig puppet which plays with a bunch of kids of different ages. Mostly babies old enough to sit up on their own and some toddlers. Each segment focuses on a different area of developmental skills. Mostly about touching different textures and exploring the world by using our senses.

The songs are cute, the production is good, the picture quality is great. I am surprised to see it for so little on Amazon, since I would definitely pay more for it. Right now we have checked it out from the library 3 times because my daughter loves it so much. We may end up having to buy it because its a very popular dvd at our library. It's hard to find it on the shelf! Plus I think I will want it for our next child. Even though my daughter is developmentally advanced and this dvd is definitely for babies, she still loves it because the songs are fun and puppets are cute. She loves to look at babies and play with baby dolls too so maybe that's another reason why.

This would make a great gift for a little one since there is no inappropriate content or anything I could see that would be offensive or objectionable to most people. This dvd in a gift basket with a little bunny toy and the pat the bunny book would be so sweet for a baby shower or Easter gift for a baby.",1421193600,,2262,4.169336384439359

8239080,5,B0010X742S,"We love this DVD! I think ""Pat The Bunny Playdates"" has the perfect blend of cute, upbeat songs and friendly settings (some of the songs I find myself singing aloud at random moments :) We also enjoy the interaction between ""Pat The Bunny"" and children on the DVD. I would recommend this as a great addition to any young child's collection.",1382572800,,340,4.590163934426229
8239081,4,B0010X742S,"My kids used to watch this movie almost every day when they were toddlers.  It's a fun little interactive movie that attracts kids attention and gets them excited about exploring their surroundings.  The songs are really sweet.  My 6 year old daughter still remembers the theme song.  I used to sing it to her all the time.  Now we sing it together as a comfort if she is having a really rough time with something.  It is definitely geared toward younger viewers and would probably be boring for anyone kindergarten age or older if they aren't already attached to the characters.  But, it's much less annoying than many kids shows and movies out there so it isn't completely horrible for parents to endure :)",1372723200,,708,4.661290322580645
8239082,5,B0010X742S,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this video.  We received the first one as a gift and it has gotten too scratched up to play, so we have ordered another.  She loves mimicking the children in the video and singing the catchy songs.",1365897600,,230,4.204545454545454
