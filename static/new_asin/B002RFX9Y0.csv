3974424,5,B002RFX9Y0,"This is one of the greatest examples of comic surrealism I have ever encountered. There's a back story that makes this truly brilliant: Chatman and Lee contacted a production company who makes custom porn for fetishists or whatever your particular kink may be.  Much like the old 'song poem' phenomenon, for a fee they will cast, produce and edit any porn script you send them. Chatman and Lee push the limits of this premise by having these committed, though I would imagine jaded, folks do a 'porn' they've written with a post-apocalyptic, Dadaist, surrealist setting and 'plot.' It is hilariously weird and discomforting from start to finish. Chatman and Lee have done it yet again - created yet more comedy with a unique and daring voice that is all their own.
Truly, this is a bizarre and brilliant piece of work.",1266710400,6,818,4.801418439716312
3974425,5,B002RFX9Y0,"If you're reading this, chances are you're a big enough fan of Wonder Showzen and Xavier: Renegade Angel to seek out more from one of the beautifully diseased minds behind them.  Perhaps the Tobasco-sauce-tongue-burning-taste-bud-obliterating brilliance of those shows ruined all other TV eye-food for you and now you wake up screaming in the middle of the night, haunted by the muddy taste of mediocrity.  What oh what will wash the grimy gunk from your gums and finagle your uvula with the fierce flavor you've come to favor?

Here we have a final solution, or at least one for about 80 minutes.  Vernon Chatman's experiment pays off big, as we're presented with 4 segments of the most bizarrely absurd proportions (""Are we just some fleeting thought in your cold brain, Lord??"").  An amateur starlet sexily bathes in the ""tears of neglected children,"" and things just get better from there.  If you're a fan of PFFR, whom I hope we see much, much more from, you need to see this like the hemorrhaging economy needs a band-aid (badly).",1266364800,13,1037,4.863636363636363
8378692,1,B002RFX9Y0,"there is no negative stars but PLEASE don't waste your time and money on this ugliness.  I love camp, I am a fan of John Waters' films, so gross-out sexual scenarios are ... at least familiar to me if not quite to my taste.  I bought this because i thought it might be interesting and experimental--what it is is lame, so badly acted that it just can't be funny, ugly, stupid an irredeemable on any level.",1427846400,,405,4.315789473684211

8378694,5,B002RFX9Y0,"Weird wonderful and truly entertaining. This weird little film seems to of been made with no money but that is fine, it is rough around the edges but that also is fun. If you like your films weird and fun this is definitely a must. I love this film.",1417478400,,249,4.1020408163265305
8378695,5,B002RFX9Y0,"Bought and hand a blind 1st viewing after a friend recommended it to me and 1) this movie is on another level of cosmically horrifying 2) I am honestly SO GLAD I watched this movie 3) I gave my copy to a different friend because I never want to watch it again

Essentially the guys behind Wondershowzen wrote some scripts on what seems like all the drugs (seriously, they make no linguistic sense), gave them to companies who will direct any porn script you send them, and this is the result.  SO NSFW IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

It's just so far from anything resembling this plane of reality, I hate the movie but I can't stop thinking about it.",1408665600,2,641,4.369747899159663
8378696,5,B002RFX9Y0,"Vernon Chatman, you are a crazy man but I love ya. If you don't know what this is, GOOD. If you DO know what this is, EVEN SLIGHTLY BETTER. This is a porno for people who have never seen daylight before. This is a horror film for people who love film and watch it religiously. For those who kinda don't give a hoot about what is technically a ""movie"", this is for you. It's like ok you know when you walk in on your mom in the bathroom and she's like ""Get out I'm pooping"" and there's that brief moment where you linger and it's like ""ugh why am I watching my mom poop"" but you can't stop. You won't stop. It's kinda like exactly that. This movie embodies all the seven sins. 1) Shame, mostly. 2) Fear 3)Corruption I can't think of the others because I don't really know them all by heart and I don't google stuff cos I'm smarter than that. Anyways, buy the film if you have friends who are porn/regular film aficionados and you'd like to trick them. This is a good gag gift for any elderly folks. Buy it for your dad and watch the film and pleasure yourselves together. But don't perform incest... That's your dad! :+)",1408320000,8,1119,4.233644859813084
8378697,5,B002RFX9Y0,"To be fair, no one is. Final Flesh is the apocalyptic nightmare become real. It is the sexual advances of 300 years of sorrow and guilt wrapped into a taco-shell enigma, topped with sour lust and guacamole. At no point will Final Flesh make any sense to a standard, human mind. Only when you are chosen by his biological document to obtain the transcendence it offers will you begin to comprehend the damning eternal void that is Final Flesh.

Weep. Weep for the souls left behind. Weep for yourself.",1370131200,4,500,4.617977528089888
8378698,3,B002RFX9Y0,"I've become a fan of PFFR.  I love Wondershowzen, Xavier, Renegade Angel, Delocated, and Heart She Holler.  All of the humor produced by this company has been off the wall and thought provoking.  But, I found it really difficult to get into Final Flesh.  Supposedly, this is surreal humor designed for intellectuals to laugh AT the actual porn stars in the ""movie"" as they struggle to act or parrot their lines.  The dialog primarily consists of pseudo psycho-sexual blather, the oppressiveness of money and the government, musings about God, dreams, the finality of this mortal coil, and the nature of the soul.  Visual symbolism, within the first 10 minutes, seems contrived, and as the movie drags on, becomes utterly confusing as it becomes apparent that the film makers are in love with their own message.  Perhaps it's an inside joke?  Perhaps I just don't get it.  But, regardless, I shall keep this DVD next to my other PFFR offerings and impatiently wait for Delocated, season 3.",1358121600,,988,4.903614457831325
8378699,5,B002RFX9Y0,"As long as you're prepared for mind expansion at the cost of dropping your previous expectations of intelligent communication for a level that feels lower but actually elevates much higher than present state I conclude that you shall be just fine. This show is madness. It is absurd. It is sad and too real. It's about sex. It's about pigheadedness. It's about you and me and the social violence we enact daily all for the sake of feeling better about ourselves. It doesn't matter what you wear, it's pointless how much money you make, the drugs you've taken or places you've been are null in value. Accept. Believe. Be free.",1279065600,5,625,4.6909090909090905
8378700,4,B002RFX9Y0,Unless you like renegade Xavier angel or other pffr productions I would not recommend this. Or if you want to creep your friends out for a birthday present go ahead. I unknowingly purchased the contents of this dvd for my friend and it was not what we were expecting.,1278460800,,267,4.469387755102041
8378701,2,B002RFX9Y0,"Vernon Chatman, aka the funniest living person since sliced bread, had an embolism of genius with the idea for ""Final Flesh,"" which, if you're reading this, you are probably already aware of:  send some deliberately bizarre, pretentious nonsense in script form to pornographers who specialize in individual custom fetish videos.  Basically ""Candid Camera"" or ""Punk'd"" on some unsuspecting adult film folk.  Funny premise?  Check.  Funny writer?  Well yeah, that's an understatement.

Unfortunately, now that you are in on the joke, the entertainment value for ""Flesh"" has been just about exhausted.  Sure, it's mildly entertaining to watch people doing stuff like rubbing raw meat all over themselves and trying to be sexy doing it, but this gets old very fast.  Also, it's pretty apparent that (at least some of) the ""actors"" know what's up.  This is perhaps best illustrated by the blooper reel included by the second act's performers (the only extra on the DVD), who seem well aware they are being manipulated by some hoaxter (watching them try to finish a scene in which a man in a diaper overflowing with spaghetti sauce that he calls his ""emotions,"" with straight faces, is far more entertaining than any scene in the actual movie).

Vernon's paw prints are all over this thing...the dialogue is absurd, surreal, sacrilegious, and generally in poor taste.  It's the same kind of stuff that makes Wonder Showzen and Xavier so gut-bustingly hilarious, but somehow it just does not work coming from amateur ugly-bumpers.

So who is this movie for?  It doesn't work as porn, obviously, but it doesn't work as comedy either.  I really wanted to like it, but honestly, I just didn't laugh once.  A great idea with not so great results.",1268179200,15,1735,5.013986013986014
