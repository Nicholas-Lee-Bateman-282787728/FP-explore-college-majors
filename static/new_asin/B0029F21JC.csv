3876803,4,B0029F21JC,"Since there are already few reviews on Fire Fox, I will review on Heartbreak Ridge.
Clint Eastwood is a talented director. He excels not only in action and drama genre, but heartwarming comedy as well. Most of his movies are worth watching over and over again. One of my favorite is HBR. This is Eastwood's version of Hoosiers(both films were opened in almost same time though. Also 1986 was a year filled with movies centering a wild man who intends to break the severely blocked system/society). The movie may seem stereotypical Gungho story just by looking at the poster and the disc case, but if you watch it, you'll realize it's really about a generational shift in US Armed Forces. Solders who fought in the times of Cold War were facing the retirement...and here, an old soldier trying to pass his torch to the next gen and considers that's his final mission since he believes that's only way to tribute to his fallen comrades. But before doing so, he must fight the military system he loved so much, unexpected generational gap, and his own personal life which had became so rigid and comfortless that his divorced wife doesn't even want to see him ever again. The protagonist is walled in by so much adverse circumstances...how does he intend to overcome them all?  The good old fashioned Marines way!(of course, that's the only way he knows haha) I believe it's quite symbolic that the film begins from police cell sequence and ends with... :D  But you can enjoy this film simply as a great war film filled with explosive action scenes too. And now...beer and popcorn time! :D Enjoy!",1318464000,,1593,4.726618705035971

3876805,5,B0029F21JC,"I had previously seen both movies, but not in blu-ray.
""Firefox"" is about a plot for an ex-Air Force pilot to steal the latest Russian fighter. The beginning portion of the movie took too long, and not enough time was used for the actual theft of the plane. Regardless of my opinion, it was an exciting movie with good special effects. The blu-ray color definitely enhanced the enjoyability of the movie.
""Heartbreak Ridge"", is a story about a veteran Marine assigned to a bunch of marine misfits in a ""Recon"" squadron. Eastwood plays the role of a Gunnery Sergeant, whose job was to shape up the misfits into a combat ready platoon.
It was interesting watching the development of the unit, were assigned to combat. Again, the color of the blu-ray edition enhanced the pleasure of the movie.
I would recommend this order to those who enjoy Clint Eastwood action movies!

3876806,4,B0029F21JC,"I have always been a huge fan of Firefox, lumping it in with Hunt for Red October for my ""superior Russian tech we must steal"" flicks. I was surprised at out crisp the blu-ray transfer is and really enjoyed watching it for the first time in a few years.

The sound design/mix is of particular interest to me - the soundscape they engineered for this film is exceptional. At no time during the plane visual effects sequences do you feel like you are listening to a post-produced ""mix"" - it registers as very real for me, which is great because the model effects don't always hold up as I would like them to.

Great price point and two movies to boot (still have to check out Heartbreak Ridge). Enjoy!",1310256000,15,699,4.410852713178294
3876807,4,B0029F21JC,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

Both movies have DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtracks, which are very good.

Video quality varied throughout the movies.  Firefox started out very good, and had a lot of very good parts, but some parts were grainy.  The flying scenes at the end were, unfortunately, grainy.  Heartbreak Ridge also had some very good parts, and some grainy parts.  Video quality in these two movies wasn't great, but mostly good.

Overall, these are pretty good movies, and I'm not terribly disappointed with the video quality.  I'm satisfied with this purchase.",1308268800,28,645,5.009433962264151
3876808,5,B0029F21JC,"I'm happy to report that the somewhat misleading use of the term ""2 movie set"", while true, is less informative than '2 Disc Set'. Yes indeed this is a 2 disc set, not '1' as widely speculated prior to release (also shown as '1 disc' on Amazon's product page).",1307491200,21,260,4.326530612244898
3876809,4,B0029F21JC,"For a taste of the Cold War at its height (and near its conclusion), Firefox is a great blast from the past.  They tried hard in the film to highlight all sorts of elements of the Soviet apparatus, including dissident scientists, Jews who were downtrodden and oppressed by the system, bureaucrats mindlessly following orders, the vastness of the country, and the intransigence of the pre-Gorbachev leadership.  The Soviet leader portrayed here is a kind of Breshnev-meets-Andropov figure, who is hoping for a technological leap above the Western powers.  This film also taps into the then-prevalent Western fears that the Soviets would make some kind of technological breakthrough that would tip the balance of power inexorably in their favour; of course, time would reveal that they were much more worried about our technological and economic advances with which they could never really compete.  But that's too complex for a film like this, which is already a spy-thriller, chase, and military adventure film rolled into one.  It succeeds for the most part on these levels - Clint Eastwood plays the still-having-flashbacks pilot drafted into the mission of stealing the new MIG-31, a plane so technologically advanced it can operate on mental commands, but limited enough that it would only recognise them in Russian (Eastwood played a pilot fluent in Russian).

In a somewhat strange role, Nigel Hawthorne (one of my all-time favourite actors) played the key Russian scientist, reluctantly but effectively developing the technology, but just as effectively determined to help it be stolen.  Many of the other actors are British, including those playing Russians and those playing Americans.  All are reasonably effective, though there are few stellar performances here.

The special effects are very good - John Dykstra of Star Wars fame produced many of the elements in this.  Scenes of flying in the cockpit and the dogfights between the planes are very effective; they were more dramatic, in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.

In all, this is an interesting film, a bit overlooked now because time has moved on past the subject matter.  It is one of the earlier films produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who has gone on to much bigger and grander projects, but one can see his touch here.

For the second film in this package, one also gets a later Cold War scenario, this time in the tropics rather than the frozen Siberian arctic.  Eastwood plays a tough-as-nails, no nonsense Gunny who has to whip a sadsack platoon of misfits into fighting Marines.  Good thing he's a Medal of Honor winner, something that irks his desk-bound, procurement specialist commander to no end.  There are lots of stereotypes here - no complete Gomer Pyles, but several close seconds.  Of course, the administrator/commander is against everything the Gunny wants to do, but the wiser general in the end saves the day for Gunny, as he and his platoon save the day for students trapped on the Caribbean island as Cubans try to take over.  And the film ends with a rousing parade, unlike the return from Vietnam.

On the whole, two good killing-time films; far from great fare, but entertaining, especially for those who like a military theme (friends of mine in the USMC particularly like to sit and pick out the technical problems with Heartbreak Ridge!).",1297814400,7,3400,5.039285714285715
3876810,5,B0029F21JC,"With all the news about Russia going on right now, how can you not want to see a film where the Americans steal a Russian super-jet and bring it back to the U.S?  I think it's one of the best of Eastwood's films in a role that was perfect for him.  Though made about twenty years ago, still is very believable and relevant to today.  And you get a bonus Eastwood film, Heartbreak Ridge, for free!  Nice package of two excellent films in Blu-ray.",1499817600,,445,4.261904761904762

It's like the characters were trying to hard to act and you could tell it. The only reason I bought these disks was...Clint Eastwood.",1355356800,,256,5.2682926829268295

3876885,5,B0029F21JC,"Gotta admit, firefox, especially considering the era it was made and the subjects, is still a great movie. Combine with Heartbreak ridge, and you're getting a good deal on a classic military movie.",1352160000,,197,5.0
3876886,5,B0029F21JC,"Very prompt service as always! Great movies! I especially wanted Firefox. I was pleased to find they released it on Blu-ray. I LOVE this movie! I was in the U.S.Army during the cold War. Heartbreak Ridge is a good movie too! C,mon it,s Clint Eastwood!",1334707200,,251,4.6
3876887,5,B0029F21JC,"Fire Fox has always been a favorite with me.  Other reviewers have gone into the details of the movies so won't. I have read both the Firefox books and I am only sorry that they did not make the second book onto a movie.  It completes getting the Firefox back home and is more exciting than the first book.  Let's just say the dogfight at the end of the first movie wounded the Firefox and as it flies away there is a vapor trail behind it.  It can't make it back home.  Nuff said, get the book it is great.

Heartbreak Ridge is another good one for Eastwood.  The old Marine, set in his way, getting it done and staying alive.  I like this one also.

I have seen other copies of both films and the Blu-ray copies of Firefox and Heartbreak Ridge are wonderful.",1325116800,,760,4.186206896551724
3876888,5,B0029F21JC,"I loved this movie!  Firefox addition was a plus but Heartbreak Ridge was what I was after.  Classic movie with a classic cast.  Love it!  What more do I need to say.  Excellent shipping and pricing as usual from Amazon.  Thanks for making this addition to my DVD collection so easy and painless..  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!  If you haven't seen either of these movies, I recommend you go out and buy them right now.  They don't make them like this anymore.  All CGI crap nowadays!!! This is what true acting was about.  Or maybe I'm just getting old...  ha ha",1320364800,3,562,4.349514563106796

8357786,5,B0029F21JC,"2 great movies, 1 low price! If you are a fan of Firefox (or Heartbreak Ridge) and always wanted an HD copy of it, then this is what you have been looking for. The picture quality is good and brings out the details you missed when you owned this on VHS or DVD, Another great thing is that the movies are on their own separate discs, so no combo disc here.

One thing of note is that the HD version of Firefox, the edges are cropped just a bit as compared to the letter boxed DVD version. It's something you won't notice unless you look for it. But then again, it's something most people won't even notice or care about since most just focus on the center of the screen.",1510790400,,669,4.1461538461538465
