8038681,2,B00064YTL6,"I am a domestic violence educator within a prison setting, and, based on the first review, I thought this video would be a unique and powerful way of introducing prospective class members to the issue of domestic violence.  In my opinion, while the actual song wasn't bad, the video itself seemed a little bit ""corny"".  In terms of having a strong emotional impact, I think overall the video fell flat and I decided to return the DVD for a refund.",1141344000,3,447,4.575

8038683,5,B00064YTL6,"I was very taken by the music and the video.
They show in a very realistic way the way childhood is in our culture. There is no idealizing of childish innocence, or pretence of generosity in the parents, but a very honest look at the true way parents and children relate, and how they have to protect themselves from each other.
There is also a sense of hope, that families, through the power of God, can be healed and can learn to care for each other.
The high quality of the recording and the simplicity and tunefulness of the music makes it very easy to listen to. I enjoyed this very much, and play it whenever I can.
I think people of my generation, who grew up in the late sixties and seventies, will enjoy this and find that it brings back a lot of memories.",988502400,2,765,4.2465753424657535
