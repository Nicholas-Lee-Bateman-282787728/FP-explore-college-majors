4466066,5,B004TWP6YA,"ADRIFT (&Agrave; Deriva) is a reflection of the eponymous certain summer every young teenager experiences.  By setting this story of discovery - of parental flaws and infidelities as well as the coming into flower sexually - in the 1980s, before cellphones and emotional isolation crept into our lives, and by placing it in the idyllic setting of the exotic Brazilian seaside, writer/director Heitor Dhalia avoids the gimmicks and interruptions upon which we all new rely and instead allows the story to unfold as a personal journey as seen form the eyes of a fourteen-year old youth.  It is a quite miracle of a film.

Famous author Matthias (Vincent Cassel) has brought his family from So Paulo for a summer vacation: his beautiful, alcoholic, frustrated wife Clarice (D&eacute;bora Bloch), his young son Antnio (Max Huzar), his middle daughter Fernanda (Izadora Armelin), and his fourteen-year-old daughter Filipa (Laura Neiva).  The interaction with Matthias and his children is warm and sincere but there seems to be a stress between Matthias and Clarice. The children spend their days at the beach where Filipa begins to recognize the onset of her coming of age when young Artur (Daniel Passi) comes on to her. Filipa is anxious about the onset of femininity and wonders about the perceived friction between her parents.  She discovers evidence of her father's affair with an American tourist ngela (Camilla Belle) living at the beach and spies on the couple in their clandestine meetings. In response she pays more attention to Artur and to a handsome bartender (Cau Reymond) whom she has discovered having an assignation with ngela. When Matthias and Clarice finally confront their children about the real reason for the summer vacation from So Paulo and their intention to separate, Filipa realizes that her parents' marriage is  a mutual sham and finds her own way of escaping the realities she has discovered: she is left adrift on the sea of Life and must find her own choices of how to face her femininity, her concepts of relationships, and fragility of fidelity.

In Heitor Dhalia sure hands this film is a tender pleasure to watch: making the focus of the story center on  the relationship between Mathias and his daughter Filipa he allows us to understand the various aspects of the fragmenting family. None of this could happen were it not for the meticulously perfect performances by the entire cast - with special emphasis on Vincent Cassel and Laura Neiva and D&eacute;bora Bloch.  The cinematography by Ricardo Della Rosa sensitively uses the water  supporting bodies as a visual metaphor, from above and from below the surface just as the film reveals the obvious and occult aspects of a failing marriage. The film is in Portuguese with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 11",1306713600,37,2798,5.047722342733189
4466067,5,B004TWP6YA,"This movie was fantastic and it's success is entirely attributed to newcomer Laura Neiva.
Ms. Neiva was outstanding and carried this movie with complete abandon.  This 20 year
is perhaps the most beautiful and charismatic actress around.  One day she will be up there with the greats.",1374364800,,284,5.0212765957446805
4466068,1,B004TWP6YA,THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORKING.  NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A CREDIT FOR IT. UGH HATE IT,1374278400,,92,3.380952380952381
4466069,5,B004TWP6YA,"This is the story of a Brazilian family spending their summer at their beach house, told mostly from the perspective of the family's 16 year old daughter, Filipa.  The father is a well know writer in Brazil, writing in Portuguese but but actually of French extraction (he's played by the excellent and very multilingual Vincent Cassell - real life spouse of Monica Belluci, who is unfortunately not in this film - he can also been seen in the Mesrine and Shrek series, Oceans 12 & 13, Elizabeth, Haine, Black Swan, etc.) and some of the dialogue btwn the wife and husband switches from Portuguese to French, when they want not to be understood by the kids..

Which happens to be quite often, because their relationship is in meltdown, and Filipa is all too perceptive.. Far too perceptive, in fact, because she notices far more than she is meant to, and begins to misinterpret the situation, as she becomes privy to too many secrets.

Like Filipa, we are invited to judge her parents, to take emotional sides.  Poor Filipa is just trying to grow up, and the adults in her life are not helping.  Not, at least, when it comes to modeling functional adult romantic relationships.

That's the drifting that the title refers to.  Adrift in a world of overwrought and aching adolescence without sufficient moral or emotional referents.  I was just thinking it reminds me somewhat of the excellent 1997 American film Icestorm, only being set in sunny Brazil, rather than wintery suburban Connecticut..",1361145600,,1494,4.854330708661418
4466070,4,B004TWP6YA,"Fourteen year old Filipa (Laura Neiva) is well into another summer vacation along the Brazilian coast, with sun, friends, and parties.  Her world begins to come apart as she learns unspoken secrets involving her parents, and these experiences accelerate her worldliness.  She loses the innocence of youth, of naivety.  And this happens a bit day by day.  Happiness doesn't last forever, and things aren't always what they seem. Watch this movie, and you'll know what I mean.

Excellent acting by all.  Can there be a happy ending?  In Portuguese with English subtitles.",1358380800,,569,5.119565217391305
4466071,5,B004TWP6YA,Good movie about the struggles of a family that is torn/drifting apart.  A great view of a young girl's attitude to what she think sees and then reality when she discovers the real truth.,1357776000,,187,4.5
4466072,4,B004TWP6YA,"Coming of age movies can be tough to make. Walking a fine line between the emotions involved, without swaying too much between being too distanced and being overwrought, is a daunting task. This movie handles it quite well.

Here's the scoop. Filipa, her brother and sister, as well as the folks are on summer vacation at their place on the Brazilian coast. At 14 years old, she's starting to blossom and is feeling much of the inherent confusion that goes along with raging hormones. Add to it that she finds out her dad (a writer experiencing writer's block) is having an affair, and mom never seems to be without a drink in her hand, and she feels like there is no solid ground on which to get her footing.

This is a very good film. The viewer gets a strong feeling for this family's dynamic. How they are as individuals and how they are together. Mom is definitely troubled. She's drinking too much. She seems to be the practical one in the family, trying to get hubby to focus and get some cash flow going. Hubby just wants to write. He can't seem to deal with the day-to-day. But Filipa is at the center. She has a natural beauty and seems to be a caring person. She does some cruel things but those seem to stem from her confusion. As the situation between mom and dad heats up she starts to unravel. She's more her father's girl so she figures dad needs to make things right. There is a twist that happens with mom and dad near the end which turns that around. It sheds new light on things but the outcome is the same. Filipa's family will be broken.

This has a good look to it. Great attention is paid to a beautiful landscape. The water motif is used to great effect. I also liked the music a lot. Many of the scored sections reminded me of Phillip Glass. Laura Neiva is good as Filipa. Vince Cassell is always good. All the others do a fine job in their roles. At 107 minutes I thought it ran a bit long, but that's a minor quibble given the overall quality. If you like the 'tortured family' type dramas, this is one of the better ones.",1343088000,4,2050,4.3194805194805195
4466073,4,B004TWP6YA,This movie makes you feel bad but in a good kind of way. The main kid actress did a very good job. Sad and real both at the same time.,1338768000,,134,3.5
4466074,5,B004TWP6YA,"In addition to the great acting showing the details of the desintegration of the couple's relationship, the movie captures very well the atmosphere and day-to-day of being a teenager on vacation on the beach in Brazil during the late 70's/80's.  Very moving film and full of nuances.",1337817600,,283,5.0212765957446805
4466075,3,B004TWP6YA,"I saw this movie on cable with Portugese audio and English subtitles.  I wanted a disc copy specifically so I could watch it without the subtitles.  I read the reviews and pored over the ""Product Details,"" even comparing them to info provided for other discs.  Nothing and no one indicated that this DVD was any different than most that include subs, which are almost always contained in a separate file that can be turned off.  Not this time.  After I bought it, I found that this disc has hard-coded English subtitles, the same as I saw on the broadcast version.  Indeed, this movie has a second set of ""SDH"" subtitles you can turn on and double the clutter on the screen.  So thanks Amazon (and also thanks to the reviewers of this same disc) for NOT providing that piece of essential information.  Surely this movie was not shown in Brazil and Portugal with English subtitles, so why are they here? I should probably not post this screed in this moment of anger, but I might save someone else the same burn.  So here it is.",1324598400,39,1027,4.508108108108108
4466076,5,B004TWP6YA,"The break up of a family has been done many times on film, some better then others. What we felt set this one apart is the way the problems of the parents are seen through the eyes of the kids. Part of the tragedy is that they often see the heart of the problem far more clearly than they are given credit for, and just as often come to the wrong conclusions and react to them. Very good acting, especially the girl who portrays the oldest daughter. She speaks volumes with just her facial expressions. Very well done!",1320278400,12,518,4.295918367346939

8441003,5,B004TWP6YA,"Actually there's no reason for this movie to be not rated. It could have been PG-13.
The story is kind of simple. Laura Neiva (As Filipa) is about 15 or less who sees her father having an affair with another young girl and begins to learn the meaning of sex and she experiences her first sex with the man she thinks is idea enough to lost her virginityl.
There is no nudity and only brief moment of indication of sex shots and I personally think that this movie is more for teenagers too.
The story is about the parents having trouble and decide to live separately and one of the reason is because the mother is having a lover with a man who is about 10 years younger then her. Also the father is constant affiair with other women too,
While witnessing his father having sex with a young woman, Fillipa(Laura Niva) a young and innocent looking girl begins to feel that he is no longer a girl anymore. Around her, a lot of men are approaching to her hunger for sex. Sometimes in a bad way, sometimes maybe because they liked her so.
Fillipa(Laura Niva) finally chooses one and experiences her first sex on the boat with him who is a cocktail bartender.
He seems nice and handsome in some way.
Now she is a woman.
It was not ideal for her to experience her first sex but it came out to be that way.
The father was waiting her on the beach when she was comming back from the boat where the bartender is still in.
Laura Niva is very young and she was 16 by the time when she was in this movie. She looked a bit younger then her look, like 14 or 15.
She has this strange charming look.  An innocent, fragile looking. Sometimes a girl that will make sudden behavior.
Vincent Cassel is a good actor who can act most any roll. From a maestro to a playboy. A killer to a cop.
The beach side view was wonderful and reminded me of another movie SEX AND LUCIA, a notirious NC-17 movie made in Spain.
Because the main charactor was too young, the director didn't show her having sex with the bartender. Also it was better not to show the moment and I liked it that way. This is not an erotic movie anyway.
After all, it was a delightful 1:40:00 watching beautiful acting of Laura Niva, Vincent Cassel.
You must check this movie out. It is only 4.5$ in amazon.",1456099200,4,2246,4.259953161592506

8441006,5,B004TWP6YA,"A story that can be identified with by many people. Family goes on vacation amid the collapse of the family. It is tender at times and violent at other times. Audio is in Portuguese and it has English subtitles. Some of the movie might be offensive to more prudish Americans but there is no underage nudity and it is a film worth seeing. Then teen star Laura Neiva is currently a top model and actress in Brazil but this is the only film with her in America, so far.",1416441600,2,466,4.247191011235955
8441007,4,B004TWP6YA,"Difficult subject (teenager growing up), handled quite well.

This movie won't appeal to everyone.  It's a drama, quite slow at times.  If you're into action movies, move on.

Pretty Brazilian scenery.

Tough call, but I thought about 15 minutes should've been left on the cutting room floor.  Still, I'd recommend...esp. If you're in the mood for something serious.",1416182400,,366,5.224137931034483
8441008,5,B004TWP6YA,A great movie more for aolescent movie goers than a family movie. The female lead is great and all other characters too. This movie is more of alot hot female teens and lolitas..,1390780800,,178,4.424242424242424
8441009,3,B004TWP6YA,"Suppose I expected too much of this movie, Not a pick me up for sure. Good acting with all characters, in a nutshell, 14 yr. old girl (along with other great looking 14 yr. old girls) lives out her parents separation in process, and witnesses her parents infidelities and failures..
 Ending scene was a puzzler to me, when father anxiously awaits Fillipa's (oldest daughters return) after a night of searching for her. Maybe that's what they do abroad. Don't feel your missing anything if you don't rent. Certainly wouldn't want to own this movie.",1388102400,,547,4.819148936170213
