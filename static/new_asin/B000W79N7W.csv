8221433,3,B000W79N7W,"Overall a very interesting production if you have a strong interest in geology.  Why 3 stars?  The sound quality is inconsistent 2)the animation sequences used to illustrate  various geological processes were very weak- better effects were available in 1997, let alone 2007. Overall, this production has the feel of something created by a University science department. If a buyer is seeking a BBC or PBS  quality production this is not it.",1501804800,,440,5.154929577464789

8221438,5,B000W79N7W,"""Geologic Journey"", a Canadian documentary, is the best video every made about North American geology.  OK, so this is not exactly a crowded field.  Other than some specialty VHS/DVD lurking out there for selected national parks (e.g., Yellowstone) there are only two others that I know of.  The first was Ron Redfern's ""Making of a Continent"" made in the early 1980's and shown on PBS.  As far as I know, if you didn't happen to tape it at the time it is now unavailable, except perhaps from certain libraries.  The second was the BBC's excellent show ""Supervolcano"" of 2005, which admitedly was a fiction show, although an extremely good one with an impressive science content.  So far, the BBC has released this only on a Region 2 DVD, so it will not play on North American DVD players.  (For those of you who are interested in this sort of thing, there is a popular geology Region 2 DVD for Britain by Alan Titchmarsh entitled ""British Isles: A Natural History""; don't hold your breath for it to be released in Region 1.)  If anyone knows of VHS/DVD's I have missed please let me know.

For those who are interested in the geological history of North America ""Geologic Journey"" is an excellent introduction.  It tells the story of the entire geologic evolution of the continet in several episodes, traveling to several outstandingly beautiful locations to tell each section of the story, though again these are primarily in Canada.  Several different geologists come in and out of the story to explain the significance of what you are seeing.  For some reason what sticks in my mind are going deep underground in a mine to see an piece of geologic history that isn't exposed on the surface, and the still puzzling story of the evolution of northern Quebec.  The story travels from Artic mountain ranges, mysterious Newfoundland mountains, and range upon range in the Rockies.  In terms of geologic history it covers numerous continential or micro-continental collisions (so many that the program actually didn't try to keep count) and goes back in time to the mysterious life of the Ediacaran Period, which happens to be preserved in a Newfoundland outcropping.  (Fans of ancient wierd life forms such as the Burgess Shale--also found in Canada--would definitely enjoy reading up on the Ediacaran.)

The only fault that I can find with this series is that it could have used more computer generated maps and effects.  This is not to say that it didn't have these--it did have plenty.  But to an amateur like me these are so helpful that I wished it had a lot more.

The question naturally arises what a midwesterner on the Illinois prairies like me would find interesting in a video that is primarily about the geology of Canada.  This might come as a surprise to some, but the United States and Canada are on the same continent (though many Canadians try to deny this) and therefore share much of the same geology.  So the Great Lakes, the Appalachians, and the Rockies are promient features common to both nations.  Indeed, in order to properly tell their story, the program must explore both the Canadian and American parts of the common lake and mountain systems.  And the program also has a very nice section on the New Madrid fault and earthquake, though I can't figure out why since this is not even close to Canada.  Still, as a midwesterner I appreciate it.

Incidentally, the companion book to the DVD is ""Canada Rocks: The Geologic Journey"" by Nick Eyles, who is a geologist who also appears in the DVD.",1197072000,24,3518,4.775206611570248
