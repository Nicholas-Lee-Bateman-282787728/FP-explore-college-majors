If you are looking for pure down right gore then this is for you...yes its outdated by today's standards but look closely at the attention on the the detail of the gore. These people spent good $$$$ on the effects, most 80's films used foam latex for the fleshy stuff, these guys used silicone which was hardly even known of back then...there was rumour that Martin Sheen viewed this film and was convinced that it was a snuff film....(keep I'm mind the quality of video back then compared to now)...I have a copy of this on VHS tape and it does look quite a bit more realistic than the more polished DVD prints....I paid $25.00 for my DVD copy and feel it is worth it.......(small note): I have shown this to several friends and they can not keep there eyes on the screen fully..lol",1368662400,,943,4.488372093023256
8039717,1,B000679N6Y,"I bought this thinking ""oh no! Am I going to be able to handle this?

I mean this is the movie that is suppose to be worse as far as violence

than SALO-MEN BEHIND THE SUN-HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and let's

not forget the crem dela crem CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST,well let me tell you

this is CAH AH RAP! I own a lot of crap too,some I even enjoy but this

is nothing to say the least. All it is is a demented guy in a samurai

outfit slowly dismembering a girl(who sometimes blinks I might add

when he goes to cut the other parts of her body very annoying)in

the end he puts her severed parts in his so called garden(hence

the name). To think not only did I shell out some hard earn cash

$32.87(it breaks the heart) I was even doing a little happy dance

waiting in line to purchase this,this fiasco. So whoever you are

save your money,and to think Charlie Sheen freaked out when he

saw this,hey Chuckie boy stay away from Henry and Cannibal or

you will be crying ""MAMA-MAMA"" you wienie head you got me all

worked up for this-this-FIASCO.",1173657600,5,1050,4.232323232323233
8039718,4,B000679N6Y,"Charlie Sheen must have been seriously wasted when he saw this and thought it was a real snuff flick.  In the movie, the mad killer cuts a chicks hands off, then her arms, then her legs, then eviscerates her, and she's still alive when he finally decapitates her.  Come on, once you sever one of the major arteries, you bleed out in like under a minute.  Though this movie is obviously not very realistic and the gore occasionally looks a little fake, it's still hard to watch and will satisfy almost any gorehound's bloodlust.",1150675200,,527,4.585106382978723
