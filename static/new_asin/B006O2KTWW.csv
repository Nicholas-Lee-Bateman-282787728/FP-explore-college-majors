I'm a sucker for a sports movies anyway, and it was a great way to experience the ways in which Hollywood and America and Bollywood and India are different and yet so much the same.  I learned a little history, a little social structure, a little about modern India's continuing struggle to bring together such a culturally varied population, and a lot about cricket.  The film's score was so fantastic that my teen-aged daughter immediately put several songs on her mp3 player, and there's really no greater compliment than that.  And finally, Amir Khan looks fantastic shirtless.  If you've been curious about Bollywood but didn't know where to start, this is the place.",1433980800,,785,4.8283582089552235
