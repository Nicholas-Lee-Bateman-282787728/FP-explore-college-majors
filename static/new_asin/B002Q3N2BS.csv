3966220,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I bought this at Target knowing that it was not the Disney movie but wanted this for my daughter anyway.  Adult concepts and terminology, language beyond prep-school.  There are only two voices for all of the characters and they are very anoying.  Please do not buy.  I am going to throw it away.",1260057600,12,296,4.528301886792453
3966221,1,B002Q3N2BS,"This is NOT the Disney movie.  Even when you put Disney in your search, it pops up, but it's NOT by Disney.  Save your money, wait until the Disney DVD is released!",1259280000,5,164,4.09375
3966222,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I will admit right off the bat that I haven't seen this video, as it hasn't been released yet as I write this, but I was immediately struck by the product's resemblance to Disney's ""The Princess and the Frog"".  We have a ""princess"" on the cover who is apparently African in ethnicity (perhaps African-American?), holding a frog who wears a crown.
The attempt here to blatantly appear to be similar to the upcoming Disney movie release is obvious.
Let the buyer beware - this is NOT a Disney product, as much as it might appear to be.
The fact that this product is categorized ""artist not provided"" seems suspicious, under the circumstances.",1259193600,26,640,4.714285714285714
3966223,1,B002Q3N2BS,"This is by ""Good Times Video"", a third world animation company that creates cheap ripoffs (not duplications) of Disney movies to attract unattentive parents. The Disney film is called ""Disney's The Princess and the Frog"" and it will not be released on DVD until next year.",1258675200,24,272,4.934782608695652
3966224,1,B002Q3N2BS,Expected animation and got moveable stick figures. The writing was flippant and lacked good storytelling.  Narrated by sassy 13-year old.,1393977600,6,137,5.85
3966225,5,B002Q3N2BS,This is one of my child's favorite movies and since it was such a good price that is why I bought it at this time.,1385942400,,114,3.6
3966226,4,B002Q3N2BS,"My younger daycare kids like this one. The girls especially like the princess.
Nice addition to family DVD library. Seller on the ball getting it mailed.",1376438400,,153,4.923076923076923
3966227,5,B002Q3N2BS,It was a cute movie. It was entertaining and we ejoyed watching it and the kidle fire is such a clear perfect size to take along,1356566400,,128,3.9615384615384617
3966228,5,B002Q3N2BS,"This is so cute! Our children were glued and loved every minute of this! This is going to make a great gift for stockings during Christmas!

This is very funny, colorful, and will keep you entertained! We laughed and laughed and rolled on the floor laughing!

We think that this should have received better reviews than it has, it is really a great cartoon full of color! See for yourself, don't go on the negative reviews, this has a great story, plot and characters!

Well back to more of The Frog Prince! A Prince that stands up as a man and a Princess that won't except any thing less! What great values, standards, and morals. A great show that shows a princess that won't settle for just any prince! Look what patience will bring you!

Give it a chance, you will like it and you will not be disappointed. The quality is great, the sound is great, the acting is great! don't know what all the complaining is about!

This will also make good for the single ladies to watch! It has some great lessons!

For our family, husband, wife and children this was great! All of our children ages 11 to 1 could not be pulled from it! Teenagers who came over even loved this as well! Adults will love this as well!

I don't have to marry the likes of you! Too funny! You will have to watch this to see the humor!",1338681600,,1304,4.297959183673469
3966229,5,B002Q3N2BS,"This movie is great! Much better than Disney's. I can't wait for the Blu-Ray! FYI clueless parents, Disney's movie is the PRINCESS and the Frog, not the PRINCE.",1326067200,,160,4.75
3966230,1,B002Q3N2BS,so disappointed when I received the movie. The folm quality was so poor and not even a discount would have convinced me to keep this movie. They advertise as if it were the real movie.,1313366400,,184,4.285714285714286
3966231,5,B002Q3N2BS,"I ordered this DVD from daaveedee on Wednesday, June 8th, 2011 and I got it on Friday June 10th, 2011 and it came from Germany! I was so impressed! I'm watching it right now with my Middle School German students and they are loving it! It's highly appropriate for school as well. It shows young German culture in such a realistic manner. Great movie for kids ages 13 and 14!",1307923200,,374,4.357142857142857
3966232,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I'll echo what everyone else said: bad animation, bad voice acting. I'll pile on with just how bad the script really is. EVERY character is a shallow, despicable, dishonest lout, even more so than the moral of this tale needs. I keep hoping for someone who show up and kill all the characters, finally giving this a satisfying ending.

Sadly, my daughter likes this movie, though nowhere near as much as she likes the Disney one.",1291420800,2,429,4.644736842105263
3966233,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I haven't seen Princess and the frog yet, watched this on youtube by a guy who uploads the worst movies ever, but god**** its too young to be ripped off alreadyO_O Dang! These companies just wait for Disney or some other good animation company to make movies just so they can rip them off immediatelyXD Go one youtube with some friends and have a ball making fun of this!",1284508800,2,371,4.391304347826087

3966235,1,B002Q3N2BS,"thank goodness i didn't buy this, but only borrowed it from our public library.  it's really lame.  don't waste your money!",1268265600,3,123,4.809523809523809
3966236,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I caught a glimpse of this gem on youtube whilst searching for clips from Disney's the princess and the frog.

Abysmal animation, Terrible and creepy voice acting, bad story, excrutiating script. Made by a Brazilian company that have released such treasures as ratatoing, tiny Robots, little fighting panda, what's up? and gladiformers. The one star I gave it is one star too generous.

Wait to see Disney's film, it will surely be amazing. Most things would be more enjoyable than this.

No child will ever enjoy this. If you love your children, if you have any feeling for them at all, avoid this",1266364800,4,598,4.786407766990291
3966237,4,B002Q3N2BS,"While not a Disney quality production, this little animated story was fun for the whole family. And it kept our kids entertained over and over again.",1264723200,2,149,4.769230769230769
3966238,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I was saddened when my 5 years grand daughter called me from Boston to tell me that the movie I sent her was not the one what she wanted. Her father, my stepson, was more explicit: The DVD movie, The Frog Prince, was just another scam by unscrupulous people. It looked like the real thing, a recent Disney movie, but it really was a deliberate action to fool some parents which are not really familiar with animations movies. Everything was bad: The animation, effects, story, voices, quality, etc.

To review this movie would be an insult to our intelligence. It was a blatant disrespect to Amanzon customers. Unfortunetly I really believe that Amazon screened much better the products that they sold; I was naive. Please do not buy this product. Just read the fine print and reviews.",1264550400,5,785,4.7299270072992705
3966239,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I also mistakenly ordered this DVD as the name was confusing with the Disney's Princess and the Frog. Anyways, we watched it and it is a terrible cartoon. The story is not interesting at all, the graphics are primitive and simple, it can't be even compared with the Disney's cartoons. The quality of it is well below par. Don't buy this DVD!",1263600000,2,341,4.516129032258065
3966240,3,B002Q3N2BS,"Not what I was looking for.  But rather than return, decided to keep for my grand-daughter anyway.",1261872000,,98,4.764705882352941
3966241,1,B002Q3N2BS,"For those who've been fooled by Gaiam's cheap attempt at marketing a knock-off product under the name of the now defunct GoodTimes DVD/Home Video company, please be aware that this is certainly not the same company that distributed the works of low-budget, but cherished, companies like Golden Films, Jetlag Productions or Blye Migicovsky Productions, among others.  This is Gaiam playing dirty, cashing into the success of Walt Disney's 2009 animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog,"" and attempting to do so under GoodTimes' name.  Please, don't let those scoundrels fool you!

Golden Films was one of the different companies whose works were partly distributed by GoodTimes.  Though it is true that they often adapted stories made previously popular by Disney (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast""), you should know that the money they made was not forwarded to greedy hands.  Golden Films is a branch of the Wheel of Peace foundation, a company dedicated to the welfare of children around the world.  Through modest budgets, they managed to create a large variety of charming and highly entertaining children's films (""Thumbelina"" from 1993 is a personal favorite of mine), and the reason that they not grow following their commercial success was because like I said, this money was forwarded to different cherity foundations helping out people in need, particularly children.

Jetlag Productions continued the line of animated classics that Golden Films started.  Their films followed a similar formular but where in many ways quite different.  For one thing, they did not feature celebrity voice artists, and as a general rule, had three songs per film.  Many of which have come to be quite popular among nostalgic viewers.  Jetlag Productions does not have in its rsum the generous act of forwarding earnings to cherity companies, but they still produced entertaining, often original, works through modest production values.  I am not nearly as informed (as I should be) about Blye Migicovsky Productions, but I do know that they've also produced a line of entertaining children's films, even if their angular, more modern style, was not nearly as appealing, and looked somewhat uninspired.

In the end, the point of this review is that:  1st, don't be fooled into buying this cheap product which is clearly attempting to make a quick buck based on Walt Disney Pictures' effort, and 2nd, the ""credit"" for this outrage should not be associated with GoodTimes Home Entertainment, but with GAIAM.  Whom not only adquired the rights to GoodTimes assets so they could sell randomly 'assorted' handfuls of their films for a flat price, but also so they could market trash like this under their name.  The company GAIAM should be boycotted at all costs, and sued for DEFAMATION AND FRAUD!",1261785600,2,2799,5.15929203539823
3966242,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I pre-ordered this DVD from Amazon early this summer believing it was the Disney ""Princess and the Frog"", and could hardly wait for the December release.  However, I couldn't believe the total lack of quality when I played the DVD this morning for the first and last time for my little granddaughter.  How disappointed we were and how embarrassed I was.  I naively kept waiting for some magical moment when the animation would become lush and beautiful.  The December release of this DVD had to have been deliberate and almost reeks of scam.  The video is poorly written, poorly drawn, the voices annoying, and the ""acting"" is pathetic.  The video is going back to Amazon, who should have been more diligent about release of this piece of trash on an unsuspecting public. If I could have rated this item with no stars (which I tried to do), I would have. It is completely lacking any sort of worth.",1260576000,21,898,4.651898734177215
3966243,1,B002Q3N2BS,"I'm agree with the previous reviews.
Looks like in a simple view to Disney version, but is not.
Do not fall in this mistake.",1260316800,8,124,4.208333333333333
8377471,1,B002Q3N2BS,"Terrible quality. It seemed like the actors were just making it up as they went along. I turned it off after 15 minutes because the princess kept calling things ""stupid.""",1522108800,,170,4.7
8377472,1,B002Q3N2BS,"There is one word for this movie: ""Bad"". That's right. ""Bad"". This movie is bad for so many reasons. And here are these reasons:
1. The animation is cheap, lazy and bland.
2. The plot is predictable, boring and has no charm or magic like a fairy tale should.
3. The characters are flat, annoying, immature and whiny. Especially the princess.
4. The voice acting is lazy, annoying and very unlifelike.
Basically, this whole movie is bland and boring. Get Disney's instead. It is much better than this piece of junk.",1501804800,,514,4.65934065934066
8377473,4,B002Q3N2BS,"Not as good as Disney's but I appear to be generous with the review since the production team is clearly small and while the animation isn't Disney quality and Flash animated instead, I think they did a good job anyway, the company clearly is low-budget and even if they are obviously capitalizing off Disney, it's not like they're plagiarizing, it's a cute family movie done by a humble team of around 10 people. They don't have the billion dollar funds to compete well with the big names like Disney. So my rating is based off that. For the parents mad that they bought this instead of the Princess and the Frog accidentally: how do you mix up these titles if they're completely different? Blame yourselves, because that's a foolish mistake to make. I enjoyed the film and hopefully this company can grow the funds to get a bigger and solid customer base and start producing more original content. Thumbs up for the incorporating diverse characters.",1464825600,,951,4.7696969696969695
