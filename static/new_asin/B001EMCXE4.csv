8298991,5,B001EMCXE4,"My little girl LOVES this video! She's just now getting reasonably good at printing, and she's begging to learn cursive from this video right along with her manuscript writing lessons To answer a previous commenter - the video teaches BOTH ways to make a ""Q"" - and then you can direct your child to do the one you prefer. The video teaches groups of letters that are made similarly, first Capitals/Uncial then Lowercase/Miniscule separately. The instruction is very good - exactly like you would expect a competent teacher to do it, except that you can pause or stop when needed, and you don't have any trouble seeing the ""board.""

Personally, I don't believe in the ""Zaner-Blosser"" method - whatever that is. I'm not a fan of Core Curriculum, teach to the test, cookie cutter teaching. And, every few years a new ""method"" is introduced that everyone has to learn - then that fad changes a few years later. I don't want to slavishly follow this year's curriculum fad, I just want basic cursive instruction, and this video does it. I want my daughter to be able to write clearly & distinctly, and to read cursive text when she sees the handwriting of others, or signs (like ""Coca Cola"") that are written in cursive script. She won't be always seeing ""Zaner-Blosser"" everywhere she goes! I do notice that this script method has fewer loops than the method I learned (which I believe was ""Palmer"") and that is fine with me.

There are a couple of minor flaws:
1. The children in the video hold their pencils incorrectly - they very tightly grip the pencil at the very end - right next to the lead tip. The video actually teaches this method of holding a pencil in the introduction. I would get a cramp in my hand if I did that! I just re-emphasized the way we've been holding a pencil all along to do manuscript/print writing.
2. The video has little games at intervals, asking the student to spot an item that starts with each letter that was just taught, and write it. The only problem is, that some of the games are introduced when working on capitals/uncials and there is no way for the child to actually write the word when they haven't learned all the letters of the word yet. It is easy to work around - I just have my daughter write the beginning letter of each item.

Overall, this is a great video, and I am enjoying using it. As another commenter stated, the price is completely out of range. Get it from your local library, like I did.",1398124800,4,2444,4.524886877828054
8298992,5,B001EMCXE4,"My sons were taught the mechanics of cursive in 3rd grade, but then were never required to use it -- so now as entering 5th and 7th graders (who are homeschooling for the first time) it's like they have to learn it all over again.  Aaargh.

Before beginning their handwriting workbooks (Essential Learning Products' Handwriting Skills Simplified: Improving Cursive Writing, Level D) I checked this Step4Kids DVD out from the library to see if it would be any help as an introduction or review.  It was PERFECT!  The DVD is 68 minutes long but is easily dividable into smaller lessons.  My sons did four days (Mon-Thu) of lessons, 20-25 minutes long (68 minutes got stretched to 80+ because they sometimes paused to work longer on specific techniques).

One reviewer complained that this DVD does not follow the improved Zaner-Bloser method, and noted that the Q is written like a 2.  Yes, the Q looking like a 2 caught my sons' attention as well -- but it was really no big deal.  I simply showed them the Q demonstrated in their workbooks, and they wrote that one instead and moved on.  It didn't detract from the DVD's overall effectiveness.",1376006400,2,1143,4.732323232323233
8298993,4,B001EMCXE4,Does NOT teach the updated Zaner-Bloser method and nowhere in the product descirption was this mentioned.  For example:  the capital Q is still formed like a 2.  :(  Haven't actually viewed the video in order to rate the quality b/c I'm debating whether or not I need to return this video--it doesn't align with my curriculum.,1332806400,,326,4.767857142857143
