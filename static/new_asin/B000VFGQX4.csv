8218552,1,B000VFGQX4,This movie is absolute rubbish.  I bought it.  Watched it.  Chucked it out.  Everything takes place in two rooms.  The two girls involved are not stunning or even average and the story line is so thin I don't know why they bothered.  They should have just gone to the sexy bits with no stupid lead ins or dialogue.  The title made it sound quite exciting but it was so boring I fast forwarded most of it then biffed it out.  Even one star I think is too much.  With so much other stuff out there worthy of a few dollars don't waste even a cent on this DVD.,1271376000,,556,4.074074074074074
8218553,3,B000VFGQX4,There's a new face-body in the world of torchlight movies: Nikki Fairchild. She's the sexyest girl I have ever seen. She has 3 scenes: one girl-girl and 2 boy-girl. They are great even if she is still not displayed at her best. The last scene is a bit spoiled by slow motion: too bad!,1198627200,,284,4.277777777777778
