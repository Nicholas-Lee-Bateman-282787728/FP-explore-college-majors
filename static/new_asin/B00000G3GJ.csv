7908935,2,B00000G3GJ,"Buyer Beware: this is an extremely poor quality attempt at producing a video chronicle of Hitler's speeches. Four of the speeches are taken directly from Riefenstahl's ""Triumph des Willens"" and are shown in truly abysmal quality. I have the DVD of the Riefenstahl film and it's in perfect condition. There's no excuse for the wretched quality shown here. In addition, the audio is singularly poor when better-quality audio exists and is now the standard.
Why no films of pre-1933 Hitler speeches? Hitler was at his oratorical apex in the campaign of 1932, but you won't see any of his vocal histrionics from that year here. Nor will you see some of his more somber speeches post-1942. Anyone even midly conversant with Hitler's career will cringe at the amateurish assemblage of footage and the laughable attempt to produce something of quality. Finally, if you don't understand German and must rely on the subtitles, forget it! The translations are problematic at best, and utterly misleading at their worst. Due yourself a favor and avoid this mess.",1057968000,22,1051,5.045977011494253
7908936,1,B00000G3GJ,"Most of the speeches on this video are cribbed from _Triumph of the Will_ The editors attempt to be slick by saying something to the tune of: ""Hitler delivers an important address to the German Nation,"" when in fact it is just another speech to the party at the 1934 rally. I wish some reviewer would have mentioned this before I bought it.
Also, the picture and sound quality is atrocious. Just get the the DVD of _TOTW_ and forget this garbage.",1016928000,24,446,4.451219512195122
7908937,4,B00000G3GJ,"You can learn a lot from Adolf Hitler through his speeches. When he talks, he TALKS! and people listen. Truly a great speaker. Though the tape lasts for only 50 mins or something. But it is worth it.",998006400,4,199,4.2631578947368425
7908938,5,B00000G3GJ,"This video is excellent for people that is looking into the sources of NS to know more about it. Nevertheless,it has some image problems, and somebody added some stupid photographs and a last quotation from an  insignificant men.",961632000,7,229,5.026315789473684
