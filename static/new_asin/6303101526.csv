561904,5,6303101526,"Great Scott [Lahti] has it exactly right.  This series settles into one's somatic cells not only because of its actors' winsome performances and the central love relationships, but also because what it has to say about the  transition between historical ages and lifestyles (and non-science versus  science) gnaws at one's bones.  This has much to say to us as we pass  through our own fin d'siecle, and it provides entertainment that is  mesmerizing. This is an extraordinary series.",918259200,5,484,5.141025641025641
561905,5,6303101526,"Have you ever encountered a TV  series which, from the first episode  on,  became an irreplaceable part of  your identity, moving you in ways  impossible to describe but felt  profoundly? FLAMBARDS was that  beautiful  a series. Set in the years  surrounding the First World War, the  story  depicts how Christina, a young  orphan sent to live with her cousins  and  uncle at a decaying country  estate, Flambards, comes of age amid  the  conflicts, passions, loyalties,  and tragedies which follow from her  new  life. Her uncle Russell,  wheelchair-bound for life due to a  fox-hunting  accident, compounds his  misfortune through heavy drinking by  the  fireplace, and takes his sole  pleasure in life from the vicarious  adventures in the hunting field  which his rugged son Mark shares  with  him. They are callous to their  servants, and cannot understand  anyone who  does not share their  absorption in the world of hunting,  hounds, and  endless leisure. Mark's  brother William could not be more  different.  Gentle, sympathetic to  the servants and the plight of their  class, and  passionately devoted to  the design, building and flying of  planes, he too  is injured while  engaging in the one sport he hates -  fox-hunting - and  must now walk with  a limp.  Christina, in her late teens  like  William, prefers his gentle  company, yet thrills to the  excitement of the  fox-hunt. And she  soon learns that her ample  inheritance, due when she is  twenty-one, has been earmarked for  the restoration of Flambards - and  that she is to marry Mark, who,  among other brutalities, has  provoked the  firing of Violet, the  kitchen maid, after making her  pregnant!  The  rest of the series portrays  the growing attraction of Christina  and  William, their escape from  Flambards into the world of the  early  aviators, and the disruptions  in their new life resulting from the  epic  slaughter of the First World  War. Everything in this series is  just  right: the casting of Christine  McKenna and Alan Parna by as  Christina and  William, the stirring  footage of restored early airplanes  in glorious  flight (set to the  haunting background music of David  Fanshawe, itself  worth the  eleven-and-a-half hours you'll spend  loving this series), the  tenderness  of the scenes where William and  Christina discover their love  for  each other, the portrayal of a  bygone age of English social life  help make FLAMBARDS a series with  something for everybody. But what  lifts  this series into the realm of  the extraordinary for me is its  unaffected  embodiment of human  goodness and innocence, of nobility  and the heroic,  and of how these  qualities can move us still, in a  time when we need them  more than  ever.  I've seen dozens of TV shows  since I first caught  episode 6,  ""Cold Light of Day,"" on PBS during a  collegiate  summer vacation almost  twenty years ago. None have found  their way as  close to my heart as  FLAMBARDS. I hope you agree. And I  wish you the very  best.",903657600,203,3009,4.915983606557377
561949,5,6303101526,"Flambards is one of my all time favorites.  I rank it with A&E's Pride and Prejudice.  If you haven't watched it, you are missing something great.",1399593600,,146,4.576923076923077
561950,5,6303101526,I love this series.  I watched it on PBS in the 70s before DVD players or eveN VHS was a widely used and so it was great to own the series so I could watch it again.  Its kind of like Downton Abby's poor relatives during the pre WWI era.,1399420800,,237,3.72
561951,4,6303101526,I saw this series years ago when it first aired on PBS in the early 1980s and wanted my kids to see it.  They loved it,1392076800,,118,3.5384615384615383
561952,5,6303101526,In light of the new period historical series this may seem slow and not as exciting but it is a fun series with characters that you can and will love.  Costumes are really nice and this is a movie the whole family can watch.,1384646400,,224,4.090909090909091
561953,5,6303101526,"What a great find!  I stumbled upon Flambards on Netflix and ended up loving it so much, I bought the DVD set. It's a series you'll want to watch more than once--there were expressions and plot points I missed the first time around, and the film was edited for a slower-paced time. None of the quick scene-cutting we've gotten used to (for better or worse) in current series like Downton. Perfect for winter or rainy day viewing! This series was never remastered or closed captioned (as far as I know), which is a shame. The DVD has a VHS-quality level to it, and the later episodes seem sharper and more colorul than the earlier episodes on the DVDs I received, but that doesn't have any effect on the quality of the story.  The sets, costumes, and camera work are fantastic and true to the period. The foxhunting, point-to-point racing, and airplane scenes were beautifully filmed and don't seem dated at all. While based on a series of young adult books, the story has a couple plot points that are more for teen and adult viewers. As an adult, there are nuances to the relationships that I think you can only appreciate once you've lived life a bit. Cousin Mark is more complex than you might think--Steven Grives does an excellent job in portraying a character that you can't help but feel for despite his bullying. Christine McKenna, Alan Parnaby, and Sebastian Abineri are also great as cousins Christine, Will, and steadfast groom Dick Wright. How great to see Rosalie Williams as Mary (you'll recognize her as Mrs. Hudson from the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series) and Frank Mills as Fowler. All the other supporting characters are solid as well, and I loved the mild humor laced throughout. Kudos also that none of the children were portrayed as pretentious. Tizzy's one of the best child characters I've seen in a long time--if ever! If you love period pieces set in the English countryside, you'll love Flambards. And, yes, even the strange theme music grows on you after a while!",1378425600,,1995,4.7298850574712645

561955,5,6303101526,Flambards is a story set in 1910 in the very early days of airplane design and development and follows a family with many problems as World War One begins. The cast were all excellant and the viewer finds that one is drawn into the story as if you  were living at that time.,1351468800,,274,4.169811320754717
561956,5,6303101526,"I watched this in the 80's when all three of my children were home. We would rush home from Sunday ngiht church just to watch it. It is even better than I remembered, and I have watched it several times since purchasing it. I recommend it as a family viewing experience so that parents are able to explain things to their children, words we don't use here, concepts that are foreign to this country...like the obvious lack of morals with Mark being overshadowed by the obvious good morals of Christina and Aunt Grace. There is much to be learned here. It was all done without sex, and the really bad things about some people's attitude in life. Christina over came everything life dealt her without waivering in her principles. Certainly not like now. As with Downton Abby, the change in the servant/master era was starting, and everyone is soon to be treated equally, especially women.",1337472000,,886,4.72258064516129

561958,5,6303101526,I remember this program from when it 1st came on tv (pbs) many many years ago. I loved it then and have always wanted to see it again.  I'm so glad it is finally available on dvd to watch over and over as much as I want.,1301270400,,220,3.6808510638297873
561988,5,6303101526,We were very pleased to find this DVD collection. Flambards was one of our favorites when it was shown on PBS. It has been hard to find in the rental sites.,1299801600,,156,4.064516129032258
561989,1,6303101526,"What were the producers/directors thinking when they created this???  It's  real STINKER... in every respect.  I kept hoping for improvement but, alas, it did not happen.  About 30 minutes into the second disc, I switched to FF3 for the remainder of the ""story"".
The story line was very weak, the direction nonexistent.  I have seen eighth-grade plays that had better acting, and the music (I use the term loosely) was atrocious.  Not only was it weird, it also frequently drowned out the dialogue... perhaps that wasn't a  bad thing, considering.  I sincerely regret having spent money for this.",1298073600,2,596,5.010204081632653
561990,3,6303101526,"I think quirky is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Flambards. I love the time period of 1902 onward. The costuming and the interiors/exteriors are top-notch but that silly music that the other reviewers mention is indeed annoying and is so irrelevant to the storyline. I was not watching PBS and British dramas in the late 70's so I am not familiar with any of the actors who star in the series. I am surprised it has not been re-made since it has alot of potential with the right cast and a better soundtrack. I am on disc three, so I am anxious to see how it wraps up. The music really ruins this in my opinion since it sounds too contemporary for the time period. I prefer Monarch of the Glen or Berkeley Square which are both well written and acted without the awful music.",1297900800,3,794,4.264900662251655
561991,4,6303101526,"I love and own many british series. Old ones and newer ones. I enjoyed The Flambards story but not the music.
I have given this series only 4 stars because of it. The music is very important in any movie and the music in this series is to me, really awful. A reviewer described it as ""hauntingly beautiful"" I was amazed! I came here thinking I would find a great many reviewers saying how bad and very annoying the music score in this series is. I was wrong.
Having said that, I did love the story and the acting, it is not the best acting but still good to watch.",1297555200,,564,4.136363636363637

561993,1,6303101526,"I forced myself to watch the entire first episode to see if it would get any better, IT GOT WORSE!!!  The picture is also very grainy as if it was from the 1920's.  Lots of shouting, angryness, sort of dark enviroment.  If that is enterntainment for you then this is for you.  Definitely not for me.",1296259200,4,299,4.285714285714286
561994,5,6303101526,I love any BBC period dramas. Flambards was a little slow at the start and I thought I wouldn't like it. I couldn't have been more wrong! By the time it ended I was indeed hooked. I watched the whole thing in 3 days. I do so love a happy ending.,1294012800,,245,3.823529411764706
561995,2,6303101526,"I could barely give this a 2 star rating. The story is so very dull, the characters are flat and uninteresting. It seems to go on for hours and hours with nothing really happening. I hung in, hoping that things would change and hoping to at least get a small amount of enjoyment after the hefty price of the set. One of the most annoying things about this series is the HORRIBLE sound track. Completely eerie, weird and inappropriate music plays throughout the film. I started to mute it whenever a new episode began, just to get through the credits. If you like early 20th century airplanes OR horses, go for it. But if you want an enjoyable series pass on this one, I wish I had.
  Check out ""Larkrise to Candleford"" or ""Cranford"" or anything by Catherine Cookson.",1293840000,4,766,4.503597122302159

562023,5,6303101526,I saw this years ago on 'Masterpiece Theater' and I loved it. I've looked for it over the years. Finally found it and placed an order. It was even better than I remembered!

562025,4,6303101526,"Overall I enjoyed this series.  Having thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy, I was thrilled to watch a faithful adaptation of those books.  The actors seemed right for the characters, and it was exciting to see the scenes come alive, especially the ones with the planes.

Because of the musical score, however, I can not give the full 5 stars.  The 'mum, mum' was annoying enough, but most jarring was the loud ""I'll sing you a song of Christina"", especially the second time they played it.  It was during a very tender, emotional moment and was completely wrong for the mood.  I managed to ignore/get past the music for the most part, but I know some viewers would be unable to do so.

Also, it was a bit disconcerting the way characters would sometimes look straight at the camera (for example when having flashbacks).

In all fairness to anyone reading this, I had to add the above disclaimers about what I didn't like, not because I don't want people to watch, but with the hope that, if they are warned, they can ignore the flaws and enjoy an otherwise wonderful series.",1251244800,4,1069,4.619047619047619
562026,5,6303101526,"Flambards is one of those truly amazing series whose story stays with you long after you have finished watching it.  The movie follows the life of Christina from her days as a young woman staying at her uncle's house, all the way through marriage and motherhood.  The story goes through a few twists, and many times seems to lead in one direction without actually following through the way one would expect it to.

Each episode in the mini-series leaves you wondering how it could get any better.",1248220800,,496,4.67816091954023
562027,2,6303101526,"We love all things British. This is a great simple series with much appeal, though it does show its age in its film quality.  Flambards was one of our favorites because it was one of the first series in the early 1980s we had ever seen that was captioned. 30+ plus years later and some genius decided that captioning was too expensive or that people's hearing must be getting better, and there is no longer need for captioning movies--""no reason to try to make any money selling this thing."" Or, with the increase in globalization, it would be better to limit their product to one segment of the population in one language by doing away with subtitles in other languages or even in English.---how do these people get these jobs? Unfortunately, we had to send this back as much as we wanted to watch it. I cannot tell all of the BBC and British movies that we have had to return or find ourselves stuck with because they are not captioned or subtitled. It is frustrating.",1244937600,11,970,4.511363636363637

562030,4,6303101526,"I'm glad to have this copy of Flambards, with all episodes.  I've loved the series since I was in my teens.  I'm fairly musically sensitive, and the first thing that grabbed my attention back in 1981 was the oddly beautiful score.  (Contrary to another review, there's no 1970's disco -- that reviewer must never have heard a real disco record.)  The story got me later, and heck if I'm still not crushing on Christina!

The film grain from the original material is visible in the video, which can be a little distracting (wonder if there's some software that can fix it), but the images are lovely.  The unbridled horses running past the manor house in the introduction remain gripping and elegant as ever.",1202515200,,707,4.7073170731707314
562066,5,6303101526,"I also saw this on PBS may years ago and loved it then. Found I still do. It's the kind of programming that doesn't happen anymore and most likely never will. Probably beacause of the expense and the extraordinary time length. It is long. The person watching would have to be as religious about carving out time to view it as I was. But I don't mind the lenght because I think it helps make it true to the book. And that's important to me.  I have never seen a remake of this. So, I love owning the DVD because I know I'll see it again and again.",1200873600,,546,4.055555555555555
562067,3,6303101526,"If they had not been written at a later date, to me, the K.M. Peyton novels ""The Flambards"" could have been a part of what inspired Stella Gibbon in 1932 to write her brilliant and very humorous spoof, ""Cold Comfort Farm"" which is also about an orphaned girl going to live with some very strange (skuzzy) relatives on a decrepit farm. The heroine of that story eventually restores the farm through her own aggressiveness and resilience.  This DVD of the BBC's 1978 adaptation of ""The Flambards"" is no spoof; however, it is a serious tale about an orphaned girl that has exhausted her welcome at her aunts' homes and has come to stay with her very surly, bitter and crippled uncle and his two rather strange sons--one being nasty and a very unkind snob loving to hunt and ride horses and the other being misunderstood but very nice and not a snob hating to hunt and ride horses but loving airplanes.  The reason that she is even welcomed in the uncle's home is that when she ""comes of age"" she has an inheritance which makes her very desirable as a daughter-in-law.  Plus once she becomes a ""woman of means"", she can restore the crumbling Flambards farm.
Although the acting is good and the series gets better as it goes along, I basically found the whole enterprise to be rather dated with the picture quality of the DVD being rather fuzzy especially in the first two episodes and the sound quality being very poor through out all of the episodes--I could not understand the dialog over the irritating background music plus, (I'm afraid, to me),  the entire series has one of the worse sound tracts that I've ever heard--it almost drove me to drink (not that I need any excuse)--(I really did not understand the use of the word""mum"" over and over in the recurring theme music; it was as if the singers had run out of words to sing and were just making incoherent vocal sounds to the music;after the ""mums"" stop then there is some infernal whistling .  All that I do know it annoyed me immensely.)
I had not seen this program previously; therefore, this was my first exposure to the Flambards.  Therefore, I have no great nostalgia for this program which no doubt affected my opinion of this presentation.
Needless, to say, I was disappointed with this DVD of ""The Flambards""",1190073600,5,2274,4.616336633663367
562068,4,6303101526,"This a is a fine series, set in that interesting period of British history when aeroplanes, cars, and horses shared the same stage.

The first two episodes are, perhaps, a tad slow, and the theme music is somewhat surreal and unsettling. That said, the production as a whole is rewarding.

I would have given this five stars but for the faulty manufacture of Tape 6. The BFS 6-tape version (discussed here) is defective and the final episode (Inheritance) is missing. I wrote to the Canadian manufacturer and they advise that they are no longer turning out this VHS series and all their stock is depleted. So unless this comes out in its entirety on DVD, you may be out of luck.",1186358400,2,678,4.595041322314049

I don't think enough praise can be given to the superb music score.  I just received my soundtrack cd yesterday from David Fanshawe with no complications [..].

I have always wanted to see who got the girl. This turn of the century story is about young people who come of age on the eve of WWI.  I wondered how they came up with so many airplanes of that early vintage. As the characters are developed, you come to really care about all of them. The servants lives are developed and contrasted to the upper class. The scenery is beautiful whether observed on horseback or in the airplane.

562072,5,6303101526,"So, I'm 50 years old; I've always loved the kind of quality BBC programs that we see on masterpiece theater, and complained about the fact that most american tv (with rare exceptions) is such garbage, comparatively.  Now this particular series, however--It is in fact simply unforgettable.  I must echo so many of the other reviewers' sentiments.  There we were in the early 80's when this series first aired on PBS (i.e., not able to just google it and buy it like nowadays), and as soon as I saw the first episode, and building with each one, I was simply awed by it.  During all this time from then until now, ""Flambard's"" would flash through my mind occasionally because of how much I fell in love with it.  I hoped for the longest time that PBS would show the series again (as they do with some other series) but alas, it seems they haven't seen fit to do so.  I have intended ever since the 80's to try to locate and buy the tapes.  Finally, I am in a position to do so, and thanks to the internet...  I just ordered the VHS tapes AND the DVDs.  It tells something about a miniseries like this when someone can see it in their 30's (or with other reviewers, age fill-in-the-blank) and the impression of it stays so strong for the rest of their life.  It is a precious example of the type of show that is so good it is art; conceived and written by the original author, and transformed by everyone involved in making the show itself into a production that so magnificently conveys the essence of the human experience it mesmerizes you.  Finally, I'll have Flambards again!  And not just for myself--it's the type of media that one wants to pass on to friends and family...",1166313600,19,1677,4.444444444444445
562073,5,6303101526,"Lucky is any viewer who encounters Flambards!  It's one of Masterpiece Theatre's best series ever. Another reviewer did a great job outlining the plot. But this is a cinematic experience that literally blows you away. The scenes of horses on fox hunt, flashing along the fertile countryside with speed and excitement, are beautiful beyond imagination. There's a great, forward sweeping movement to each episode, an Edwardian country grandeur that's irresistible. It's Christina's series, and Christine McKenna never falters in creating the captivating heart of a story not without its ruthlessness. An ever present human sadness tracks the story like a stalker, but one never tires watching; redemption always comes at a price. The aeroplane scenes are as majestic and vital as the ubiquitous horses, and William is the sweet relief to the mongrol aspects of his beleagured family. As fine as it is, I'm convinced this series would be noticably less without its absolutely magnificent music, an essential component from the get go. The theme music alone will live forever!  Get this beautifully done DVD version and make a date with forever.",1142899200,33,1141,5.263736263736264

Mark was a drunken wastral and William a tender dreamer, but the series ends with Dick,the sensible, realistic stableboy,riding off with Christina to start the process of rebuilding Flambards and restoring a semblance of normality to life after the war.",1139270400,17,513,5.180722891566265
562075,5,6303101526,"I first saw this series on PBS in 1980; in fact, with two different PBS stations, I ended up watching each part 3 times a week! Each subsequent viewing was as wonderful as the first. Christine McKenna was simply luminous as Christina Parsons, the orphan girl sent to live at her uncle's Essex estate in the years preceding World War I and coming to know her two cousins, arrogant Mark and brilliant, scientific William, as well as Dick, the gentle stableboy, as William took steps into the new world of aviation despite the abuses of his wheelchair-bound father. This is a beautifully-filmed series that is unfortunately not really showcased by the DVD transfer, but it doesn't matter, it is Flambards complete and unedited (unlike the 1980 PBS broadcast that combined parts 1 & 2 into a single hour-long episodes and A&E's ""chopped-to-flinders-for-commericals"" version). Actors Edward Judd (as the choleric Uncle Russell), Alan Parnaby as Will, Steven Grives as Mark, Peter Settelen as Will's fellow-flyer Sandy, and Carol Leader as the unconventional Dorothy are also outstanding. And there is David Fanshawe's memorable soundtrack as well, with haunting themes, sprightly interstices, and the nostalgic ""Song of Christina"" ballad. I was lucky enough to find the LP soundtrack in the Harvard Coop many years ago and play the music with delight even today. Not to be missed!",1138406400,70,1375,5.142857142857143

I fell in love all over again. My husband, who had never heard of Flambards, enjoyed it as well. We looked forward to viewing each installment and were satisfied with the quality of the discs and the ""corny"" music.  In fact, I found myself humming the ""Christina"" song for several days afterward and my husband was cheerfully whistling the theme music.

I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a great story, fantastic scenery and characters that will steal your heart. I give it ""two thumbs up.""",1126137600,21,741,4.713178294573644

She said she'd refused to go out Wednesday evening because Flambards was showing, so now she wanted us to watch it.  My sister and I were reluctant.  ""It's another one of Mom's old movies.  It'll be so boring."" we said to each other.  We sat down-- and fell in love.  This series is so wonderful that it's just unbelievable.  Or rather, completely believable.  You watch it, and everything feels real.  You feel like you're there.  Everything works perfectly.  Just beware, film quality is bad, and there aren't any special features (i.e. no trailer, no subtitles...).

562118,5,6303101526,"I adored this series when it first aired in 1978, I was 12 at the time and staying at my Gran's during the summer it was first aired in England. It became a ritual for us both to watch the show without interuption. We would work hard in the lead up to Friday evenings, do the housework, prepare and eat the evening meal, wash up, have baths and settle to watch Flambards with a bag of fruit bonbons to share.

 The story was a wonderful encapsualation of dominant themes from the early 20th century, aviation, the decline of the gentry, emerging war in Europe and the rise of the rights of Women. All these issues are deliciously brought to life in the life of the characters but particularly through Christina, William and Christina's friend Dorothy. It was a delightful show which signalled the importance of 1900's and 1910's for a new generation (it was news even to my Gran who was born in 1926) and it displayed the valor of the human spirit shining through diversity. Important, overlooked, historically educational, emotive nad beautiful. I have special memories of this series as it now signals times past for me, my Gran died in 1990 and life is not as it was in 1978, now. For me this signals the increased value of Flambards and stories like it, for not only are they highly dramatic and engaging stories but they are perfectly clear windows into forgotten and unknown portions of history.",1117238400,10,1401,4.622489959839357

I wasn't sure it was going to turn out the way I wanted it to (or the way I thought it should). I don't want to give anything about the ultimate ending away, so let me just say all ended according to my wishes. About the plot: Christina moves in with her half-uncle and two male cousins. They're an embittered trio of men who are divided between love of horses and hunting and love of a new invention called the airplane and flying (aeronautics). Christina, as most heroines, touches the lives of her two cousins and her riding instructor-servant-first love Dick Wright (who has the brightest, blondest hair I've ever seen in my life and...he's cute). Anyway, twists and turns lead you through love, happiness, friendships, pain, death, tragedy and lessons learned.

The music is horrendous, David Fanshawe should be ashamed for writing such a dated soundtrack! The music is a cross between a silent film of the twenties and a 50's sci-fi movie - if you could just turn the music track off the series would be 100% improved. The acting is very broad and at times laughable, I can't comment on the story as I haven't gotten past the first two episodes! I think unfortunately many people's reviews are based on fond memories when it was first aired, but this series is extremely dated, and I think many people will be extremely dissapointed with it, as I was.",1073347200,12,847,4.435897435897436
562122,4,6303101526,"I am extremely grateful that this wonderful series is even available on DVD.  Most unfortunately, the company that created the DVD did a terrible job, and the video quality is just awful; its like they created it from an old VHS tape.  Most people won't notice and/or won't care, but those watching on a high-quality monitor will find it sometimes distracting and annoying.  Its really a shame.  Perhaps sometime in the future we'll have a new hi-def version from the master film negative.

Update: since I wrote this, I learned that many if not most British TV programs were filmed using 16mm cameras to cut production costs. Almost all US television shows and movies are filmed using 35mm, which contains roughly 4 times the detail of 16mm. Also the 16mm film stock they were using at the time often wasn't that great. This wasn't very noticeable on the TVs then. What this means is that these DVDs may have the best picture that will ever be available.",1056412800,15,955,4.6946107784431135

In the tradition of ""Heidi,"" Christina soon becomes assimilated into the Flambards way of life, becoming the eventual romantic wishbone between Mark and William.
I have never previously viewed Flambards, so I was completely blown away by the spectacular story, and fantastic acting. I LOVED Christina, her romance with William, and felt sad for Violet and the stableman Dick. My only problem with Flambards at all was the SOUNDTRACK. There is some awful 'seventies' style disco music which has people actually singing: ""Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom"" and whistling cheerily throughout. This was... Well, quite frankly awful, and did not suit such a well-done period piece.
Plotwise: I also felt William was a bit too obsessed with planes. Everything was about 'him' and his desire to achieve HIS dream. When it came to Christina and HER interests he scoffed and picked at her love of horses. Christina, of course was VERY tolerant, loving and considerate. I wonder if William would be so tolerant if it was HIS interests were the ones being constantly ridiculed
Overall, a great series the entire family will enjoy.",1055203200,12,1246,5.024154589371981

With so many good series to watch, the ordeal of an eye-stain is just not worth it.  I felt the people who released this dvd took their customers for granted.  This review is about the quality of the picture, not the actual content itself, which is excellent.

Watching this on a small screen 14 inch TV helps to reduce eye-strain.  There are no sub-titles.  As this genre of movies tend to be watched when the brats are asleep, sub-titles help in allowing the volume to be kept down.

We know this stuff is dated.  Nobody is expecting the picture quality of Gosford Park or Pride and Prejudice.  But save this purchase until you have seen the rest.  Test your eyesight tolerance with Sorrell and Son.  Sorrell and Son will of course get the 5 star reviews.

If you have the stomach for the picture quality of Sorrel and Son, you still have some way to go before you can cope with the picture quality of the Flambards.

Be warned.  People who buy this sort of dvd usually do not have the time or want to put up with the hassle of returning them.

November 2009 update:  Cranford in Blu-ray is only $28.  Bleak House Blu-ray is $34.  Little Dorrit dvd set is $31.  And they all have subtitles.

I must say that the story is so wonderfully woven with fine characters and actors to compliment each personality of the many characters in this film. Kristine Mckenna was just terrific in her characterization of  Christina Russel. She portrayed a gentle yet compassion driven young woman who was trying to find her way in life and ends up in the chaotic household of the Russell family, her first cousins. How she manages to hold her sanity in her dealings with her Uncle Russell and her cousins Mark and her beloved William is a miracle in itself. The characters portayed as the household staff were indeed a funny addition to a wonderful, zaney plot.

562139,5,6303101526,"The best dramatic series ever aired on television, December 2, 1998 Reviewer: A viewer from Phoenix, Arizona  This is the headline from the review I wrote on December 2, 1998, and left anonymous.  It was my first review on Amazon.com.  I haven't done many to date, but the reason I started came from the joy and inspiration from this fine television series. Those who know this series are passionate in their praise. Years after seeing it, most remember the scenes, faces, and music from this show more vividly than almost any other film experience they've had.  Many agree that they ""lived"" the show moment by moment, as if it were really happening.  This kind of power in cinema comes from true artistic performance, across the board; the writing, the acting, the settings, the music, were as perfect as could be. Lovers of this series of books and TV episodes cried out for tape versions and reprints.  They have been overjoyed when the VHS set was released and re-released.  But now the series has been released on DVD, for any videophile, the preferred medium for video archive.
Is the DVD set what you would expect?  Well, it is not perfect.  The blemishes of an old film master show less forgivingly on DVD, particularly in some early episodes.  Sometimes, there is a flicker or a scene that seems a little blurry.  Sometimes, the up and down sound master also requires the DVD sound remote to be close at hand.  DVD sparkles on new technology-driven movie masters.  For a 22+ year old film set, without a pure master, the DVD images are less crisp and the sound has less punch.  But for those who know and love Flambards, this DVD set is still a blessing, worth every bit of its price.  I hope through this DVD release (long overdue) more people can discover and experience the overwhelming beauty of this fine series.",992304000,21,1826,4.6802507836990594
562140,5,6303101526,"Have you ever encountered a TV series which, from the first episode on, became an irreplaceable part of your identity, moving you in ways impossible to describe but felt profoundly? FLAMBARDS was that beautiful a series. Set in the years surrounding the First World War, the story depicts how Christina, a young orphan sent to live with her cousins and uncle at a decaying country estate, Flambards, comes of age amid the conflicts, passions, loyalties and tragedies which follow from her new life. Her uncle Russell, wheelchair-bound for life due to a fox-hunting accident, compounds his misfortune through heavy drinking by the fireplace, and takes his sole pleasure in life from the vicarious adventures in the hunting field which his rugged son Mark shares with him. They are callous to their servants, and cannot understand anyone who does not share their absorption in the world of hunting, hounds, and endless leisure. Mark's brother William could not be more different. Gentle, sympathetic to the servants and the plight of their class, and passionately devoted to the design, building and flying of planes, he too is injured while engaging in the one sport he hates - fox-hunting - and must now walk with a limp. Christina, in her late teens like William, prefers his gentle company yet thrills to the excitement of the fox-hunt. And she soon learns that her ample inheritance, due when she is twenty-one, has been earmarked for the restoration of Flambards - and that she is to marry Mark, who, among other brutalities, has provoked the firing of Violet, the kitchen maid, after making her pregnant! The rest of the series portrays the growing attraction of Christina and William, their escape from Flambards into the world of the early aviators, and the disruptions in their new life resulting from the epic slaughter of the First World War. Everything in this series is just right: the casting of Christine McKenna and Alan Parnaby as Christina and William, the stirring footage of restored early airplanes in glorious flight (set to the haunting background music of David Fanshawe, itself worth the eleven-and-a-half hours you'll spend loving this series), the tenderness of the scenes where William and Christina discover their love for each other, the portrayal of a bygone age of English social life help make FLAMBARDS a series with something for everybody. But what lifts this series into the realm of the extraordinary for me is its unaffected embodiment of human goodness and innocence, of nobility and the heroic, and of how these qualities can move us still, in a time when we need them more than ever. I've seen dozens of TV shows since I first caught Episode 6, ""Cold Light of Day,"" on PBS during a collegiate summer vacation almost twenty years ago. None have found their way as close to my heart as FLAMBARDS. I hope you agree. And I wish you the very best. END",991267200,62,2887,4.918032786885246
