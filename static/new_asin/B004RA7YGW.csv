8438788,4,B004RA7YGW,"3 1/2 STARS -- THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AS I WILL EXPLAIN BELOW

French import is likely as good as the eventual US release (not dated at the time of this review) as long as you can navigate the French menu.  US release will not likely have English dub so it's subtitles no matter what.  The movie is just titled DUMAS for the US release and is already available on streaming video.

This movie spurred a lot of praise and criticism alike.  Let me explain a little of both so you can understand why I won't give it perfect marks, nor will I give it a lower score just because of some shortfalls.  This is a beautiful movie that will entertain many.  However, it is not perfect by any means.

THE PLOT:  This movie depicts the sometimes turbulent relationship of Alexandre Dumas with the most prominent of his assistant writers, Auguste Maquet.  It is also set against the even more turbulent political backdrop of France between its revolutions.  Many accounts actually refer to Maquet as a ghost writer, not just an assistant.  I don't know the degree of his involvement.  However, Maquet was heavily involved during the period Dumas created some of his most famous works.  Our story picks up with Dumas and Maquet working on a sequel to Three Musketeers.  In a case of mistaken identity, a beautiful young woman approaches Maquet thinking he is Dumas and requests his help in freeing her father (who is a revolutionary).  Maquet is actually a monarchist to Dumas' republican.  However, he is so charmed by this woman that he falls in love and carries on with the deception in an attempt to win her love.  There is the conflict of his deception, professional and personal envy - perhaps with Dumas' success with women - and political conflict as France lurches forward into another revolution from the interim monarchy that had managed to come back into power.

WHAT I LIKED:  There are many beautiful scenes of French countryside and the stand-in chateau they used for Dumas' home (Chateau Monte Cristo) was gorgeous.  I do not believe it was the real one though, which is quite extraordinary itself.  The performances were outstanding overall.  Regardless of whether this movie is historically accurate or not, the actors do an excellent job.  Depardieu and Poelevoorde have an excellent rapport to bring the relationship to life between Dumas and Maquet.  What I felt really added redeeming life to a movie with flaws was the exceptionally strong casting of the women around the two characters.  Melanie Thierry is always charming and she makes a great Charlotte (the daughter of the revolutionary).  But I have to say what an amazing presence are Dominique Blanc as Cleste Scriwaneck (Dumas female companion and assistant), and Catherine Mouchet as the wife of Maquet.  As much as the movie focuses on the Dumas-Maquet relationship, I just can't see this movie surviving without the performance of these fine actresses.

THE LESS GOOD:  There was some casting controversy around this movie since Dumas's grandmother was a slave in Haiti and Depardieu clearly does not have that heritage.  I liked Depardieu's performance, but agree that it would have honored Dumas and history better if the actor chosen had reflected that heritage accurately.  In defense of Depardieu, he at least embodies some of the physical jolliness and larger than life personality. I also felt that this movie focused most of its effort in depicting the gluttony, rakishness and even supposed stupidity of Dumas while giving more credit to Maquet.  I am not saying Dumas was dense, I am saying the movie portrayed him as so.  The movie does seem to show at times that they need each other for their best selves.  However, only token attempts are made to retrace and give Dumas a little credit.  For such a lavish production in terms of performances and scenery, the camera work seemed shaky and ill framed, even with stationary indoor scenes.  A beautiful subject does not in itself make a master photo.  This movie may also seem a little vulgar to some who are not prepared to see Dumas' foibles exposed.

Ultimately, I felt this movie was a tremendous missed opportunity to make an-all time classic, opting instead for a superficial caricature.  It fails to be a historical reference because of the heavy artistic license (that's fine if there is a point), and yet fails to plumb the relationship which seems to be the whole point.  Despite its attractive headline, I don't think this movie is for everyone even if you love period drama.  I can say the period is very authentically portrayed.  Try it as a rental first before you buy.",1404432000,4,4621,4.8331210191082805
