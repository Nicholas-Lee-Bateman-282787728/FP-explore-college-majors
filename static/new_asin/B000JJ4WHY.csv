8311434,4,B000JJ4WHY,"its ok, kinda funny how in all Anime movies or tv shows, only children have power, or control giant robots to save humanity. Don't the anime cartoonists realize that children grow up? lol same thing over and over. but I liked this anime",1470700800,,236,4.511627906976744
8311435,5,B000JJ4WHY,This is one of my favorite series. An interesting story with well developed and interesting characters.  The English dubbing is also done very well.,1388793600,,148,5.166666666666667
8311436,5,B000JJ4WHY,"There is nothing about this anime that I don't like... except for maybe that they do go a little heavy on showing off the rear ends of some of the female cast(Which, actually, is somewhat of a change of pace from many anime series that throw gigantic boobs in your face all the time)

The characters are all interesting, and they develop nicely as the story progresses. The animation is all well done, and the artwork is superb.

The story has unexpected twists, the villains are as interesting and deep as the main characters themselves(Even the short lived ones).

The anti-heroes I love especially, since they don't follow normal ""Anime Logic"". IE. If someone stops the anti-hero from killing a villain, in most anime, the anti-hero is done trying to kill that target. In this.. well when you see the scenes you'll know what I mean. They're much to awesome to ruin for you. It's refreshing to see.

This is definitely worthy of so much more, and yet I had never heard of this series until I accidentally stumbled on it doing random searches on amazon. Someone needs to get their advertisements going in the right places, because this is definitely one that no anime fan should miss.

And it's SO DAMN CHEAP to get a new copy on the marketplace. What's wrong with you?! Go now! Buy Buy! Or at least go find an episode on the web before hand... definitely worth watching and owning.",1233619200,,1383,4.605691056910569
8311437,5,B000JJ4WHY,"Wow, I really can't believe that nobody else has reviewed this gem of a show. I can see where perhaps some only watched the first volume or two and decided it wasn't their cup of tea, but surely there are other diehards like me who watched the entire thing and wanted to promote this underrated series. This is going to be a review of the entire show, not just the first volume.

 To start, Solty Rei is just a phenomenal anime. Absolute first rate voice acting from the English cast, most notably Christopher Sabat (aka Prince Vegeta), and animation studio Gonzo does a heckuva job on the CG/traditional animation combo.

 *Minor Spoilers may follow*

 The show opens basically enough. Roy Revant is a bounty hunter, chasing down the baddies with his hard-nosed attitude. He's lost his wife to cancer, and his daughter to a mysterious disaster called the Blast Fall. One night, one of his hunts goes awry, and this mysterious girl falls from the sky and saves his life. She grows attached to him, and he pushes her away, with amusing results. Oh, and she's a cyborg.

 Sounds simple. Your basic anime plot, right?

 WRONG. Dead wrong. While Solty Rei may start out on a rather formulaic note, by the time you reach the halfway point, the entire series does a ""180"" in tone, and doesn't let up for a second. Since so much of my enjoyment was derived from the major plot twists at the midway point of the show, I won't spoil it for anyone, but suffice it to say, it's big.

 By the time you make it to the end of the series, everything you thought you knew gets stood on its head, and you'll become attached to all the characters, desperate for more action. The ending is wholly satisfying, and answers all the questions that are raised during the course of the series.

 Don't pass this one up, or be dissuaded by negative reviews for the first couple of volumes on other sites. You will not be sorry you spent money on this one.",1193270400,7,1929,4.489971346704871
