8462124,2,B0058OY50Y,"I had assumed from the recent publication date that this was a recent performance, but no such luck.  This is clearly a production from the 1970s that was poorly converted to DVD.  The sound quality is so awful that it's virtually unwatchable, making it impossible for me to really comment on the performance itself.",1365724800,4,316,4.833333333333333
