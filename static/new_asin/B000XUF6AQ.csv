8229757,1,B000XUF6AQ,"Essentially not very funny, and seemed just to be a bit of an ego trip. I like Tony's work both factual and comedic, but this material is weak and often a platform for his politics. These areas feel more awkward than humourous as on the whole thay are delivered in a spiteful manner rather than a more engaging, witty satire. There's obviously quite a few chips on those shoulders. The anecdotes didn't really go anywhere or make any significant points, more an opportunity to name drop. Also the edit seemed to rob it of any natural flow - maybe the bits inbetween were really poor! I really tried to like it but have to say I struggled to make it through to the end.",1480723200,,668,4.395161290322581
8229758,2,B000XUF6AQ,"I usually love any Tony Robinson project.  I've read his books, watched various programs he has hosted or starred in and always found him funny and entertaining, but this video fell flat.  It had moments of humor and some interesting history, but I found myself regretting the purchase almost immediately.  I think his talent and humor is better expressed in documentaries and comedies, but not stand up.  I would have been much more entertained watching Black Adder or Time Team.  I just don't think stand up comedy is his forte.",1366675200,,530,4.844444444444444
8229759,5,B000XUF6AQ,"Tony Robinson's Cunning Night out is not what I expected, I assumed he would tell jokes and perhaps bring up a few ""Blackadder"" stories but instead, I got to learn a little about the man who made Baldrick so interesting. First of all, if you are expecting a laugh riot, this is not your cup of tea. I understand Americans have a different sense of humor so if you are expecting something like that, move on.

Tony starts off by speaking about his upbringing and continues on to his career and his daughter's writings, which is interesting and you can see the pride in his eyes as he retales one of her stories and he closes with a few Blackadder stories to round out the evening. There are some pictures in the background to augment his stories and his Blackadder stories do capture your attention. I did find out that Tony hosted a very interesting show called ""The Worst Jobs in History"" which is fascinating by watching this video.

The programs is fun and entertaining, this is basically a mini biographical stand up show and it's a great companion to the Blackadder series or for Tony Robinson fans in general.",1342742400,2,1115,4.57
8229760,1,B000XUF6AQ,"Standup ain't your forte. Maybe if you'd done more stories & outtakes from 'Blackadder' this vid would be worth it but 80% of what you do is cuss & you just ain't funny. Stick to comedic roles.
Save your money for the Blackadder collection.",1245542400,3,240,4.4772727272727275
8229761,4,B000XUF6AQ,"It was interesting to see ""Baldrick"" of the Blackadder series as himself.  He displays his fine acting ability and intelligence.  I laughed out loud several times.  Of course, it's tough to top the role he played in Blackadder, but it's worthwhile to see him being Tony Robinson.",1207785600,4,279,4.8936170212765955
