4886777,5,B005SQRYG4,"I got my advance copy of this, and I have to say that it turned out quite well. There are always problems always inherent in these sorts of things where all of the film elements had to be compiled from different sources. As a result (I'll go through the negative first), some of the opening and closing elements are of a rough bootleg quality, because they are! I supplied them. Somehow, even though these shows had aired endlessly for about 30 years, things got lost. The audio wasn't even transferred on many cartoons, so that we have many cases where audio from bootlegs is supplied to be reconnected with pristine video images.

Now for the positive, this is the most complete Underdog set that has been issued, and that you will probably ever find. Episodes are presented in chronological order and overall are very well. Unfortunately, some of the episodes have the updated titles, but this is very minor considering the excellent picture quality of a lot of these items. And the theme songs are all there, and all original, too!

The documentary segment plays very well and is quite informative. Everyone is very animated in their discussions...even me! My segments were recorded in Oregon last August. I haven't listened to the phone conversations yet, but I assume that they've come out well, also. I even learned something that I didn't include in my book, that Norma MacMillan voiced Sweet Polly from LA, and not New York. No one told me that before and I never thought to ask.

Overall, I'd give it 9 1/2 out of 10, for the few minor shortcomings this has, but really it is a 10 for the outstanding effort put in by me and Cliff MacMillan, Reed Kaplan, Mark Yurkiw, Dave Downey and all the rest of the interview subjects.

4886778,5,B005SQRYG4,"I have two official Sony Wonder DVDs with a few episodes and a bootleg copy (with up n down picture and sound quality) of just about all the episodes of Underdog.  Even so, I've been waiting on the complete official release for years. Shout sounds like they care about how they release these old shows so I'm confident that the PQ & AQ  will be the best it can be.

The Sony Wonder DVDs mentioned above didn't even have the original theme music for the episodes with the Gophers, McBragg and Klondike and that is another big reason for wanting to get this set.  The real icing on the cake would be if there were original vintage commmercials not in the extras but in place like originally broadcast.  One thing that all the shows have is great theme and incidental background music that is very catchy.

I have two books at home on the people who were responsible for these cartoons and it's sad that most of them aren't around anymore.  Back then, Underdog was in competition with Rocky & Bullwinkle (another favorite)and some have mistakenly thought the same people produced both shows.  The mix-up came from the fact that a lot of the artwork was done by the same studio (Gamma) in Mexico.  It would also be nice to see all ""The King & Odie"" episodes released with Tooter Turtle, The Hunter and Tennessee Tuxedo. Even better would be if all these cartoons would be released on Blu Ray?  Thanks Shout for bringing these out.",1323129600,13,1426,4.53515625
4886779,5,B005SQRYG4,"We finally have some sort of description of this upcoming release from SHOUT!Factory. This info was posted on TVShowsondvd.com. Let's keep our fingers crossed this all comes to light!

The long-awaited legendary cartoon arrives on DVD from Shout! Factory this coming January 24th with every episode of Underdog, plus original shorts featuring characters such as Go Go Gophers, Klondike Kat and Commander McBragg. This all comes enclosed in ""high-end packaging"" with all-new DVD extras that will entice fans to jump on this release! While Shout! hasn't finalized the supplements for the set, the preliminary info sent to retailers (may be subject to change!) shows these bonus items they hope to have will include:
Commemorative book; Bonus cartoons: Tooter the Turtle and The Hunter; Alternate episode openings and closings; Featurette; Commentaries with writer/producer/co-creator W. Watts Biggers, voice actor George S. Irving, producer Treadwell Covington, animation historian Mark Arnold and more...
Again, that list is NOT finalized, and could be subject to change. Stay tuned for the official Shout! Factory press release for all of the completed details about Underdog - The Complete Collector's Edition 9-DVD set. Remember, as much as 70% to 80% of the material on this title has never been released on DVD before.

NOTE: Some of our readers have inquired with us about original music on this set, pointing out that some syndicated rebroadcasts in recent years have had replacement music, and hence such replacements were also seen on some of the previous home video releases. We asked the studio about this, and we were told in reply that Shout! Factory is *not* using syndicated masters of the episodes, so there is unlikely to be any replacement music on their DVD release. Our contact informs us that ""we are rebuilding the shows to their original television airing as best we can"", pointing out that the cartoons were never saved that way (as a 22-minute show), but rather they were saved as the individual cartoons. So they are going to do their very best to re-create the original viewing experience!",1318204800,85,2115,5.19941348973607

4886802,5,B005SQRYG4,"At first, I was a little disappointed because Tennessee Tuxedo was not included in the episodes. But then I found out that was because Tennessee was originally a stand-alone cartoon; they added TT in syndication. I first viewed Underdog in its syndicated, re-edited form as a kid in the early seventies. However, I do appreciate the fact that Underdog has been restored to its original format. I would recommend this DVD set because, for one thing, you get every single episode in one compact package (I was disappointed in Underdog Chronicles for its lack of completeness). After this first practical consideration, I would recommend this show because it is a gem. It is very entertaining because it was obviously well-acted, well thought-out, and lovingly crafted. Besides these things Underdog is charming, and charm is sadly lacking in some of the cartoons being produced today.",1432944000,2,882,5.131944444444445

4886816,5,B005SQRYG4,"Wow, when I got the chance to see the original UNDERDOG series uncut I just jumped at the chance! It's great to see Commander Mc Bragg uncut with all 3  song beginnings  as well as the GO GO GOPHERS cartoons! Both BATTYMAN 4 parter and THE PHONEY BOOTH 4 parter are slightly edited, so it's not perfect while other cartoons have their 4 parter storylines intact!

George Irving the narrater starts out every cartoon with zeal and pep, "" Will Underdog stop ""Simon Bar Sinisterer"" in time? Theres plenty of excitement in our next episode!!  Whether  it's Riff Raff the Gangster, the Mole Men, the Magnet Men and many others, ""There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!!"" Seeing these cartoons in their original format without commercials is a real treat!

The Commander Mc Bragg and GO GO GOPHER cartoons are a nice break in the action before the next part of the four parter begins! The GO GO GOPHER cartoons start with ""Two little indians all other gone! Two little indians left all alone! No others try to run, no try to lead, What can they do for fun!? GO GO GOPHER watch them go, go, go!! While Commander Mc Bragg begins, ""While the Marines may plant the american flagg, they may be led up the hill by Mc Bragg! With a cannon in hand, he beats every man or so says the Bragg of Mc Bragg!!"" Two other different beginnings start the Mc Bragg cartoons!!

Klondike Kat and Tooter Turtle also fill in later but are not as funny or to the point as the Mc Bragg cartoons or GO GO GOPHER cartoons! But it's ultimatly UNDERDOG'S show! So as Underdog says it, ""When Polly's in trouble I am not slow, so it's hip, hip, hip and away I go!!",1409529600,7,1630,4.377483443708609

4886820,5,B005SQRYG4,"This cartoon was not only a favorite of mine as a child but of my late father, who was a military policeman during World War Two.  (He liked cartoons growing up, but this one came up when he was well into his adulthood.)  Well into my own adulthood, I reviewed it and found it just as funny as ever.  Old-fashioned, maybe-Simon Barsinister used vacuum-tube technology in his inventions-but not dated.

Underdog had his superpowers: his ability to fly, his super strength his computer brain, his atomic breath, etc., even if he sometimes had to revive himself by taking a pill when he got weakened as sometimes happened.  He used not only brute force but cleverness to defeat his enemies, an example being how he managed to defeat Simon Barsinister and his snow gun by spinning him around and making him too dizzy to fight.

Too bad they don't show this today-certainly it is far better than most if not all current cartoons.",1407369600,,924,4.672839506172839

4886836,4,B005SQRYG4,"UNDERDOG-THE COMPLETE SERIES: The most beloved canine do-gooder of them all, Saturday morning staple UNDERDOG was the rhyme spouting alter ego of unassuming SHOESHINE BOY (like CLARK KENT, only a pair of spectacles hid his true identity), perfectly voiced by milquetoast character actor WALLY COX. When spurred into action by the cries of TV reporter/perpetual damsel in distress SWEET POLLY PUREBREAD, UNDERDOG battled his arch foes, which included crackpot scientist SIMON BAR SINISTER and pinstriped canis lupus gangster RIFF RAFF, not to mention a motley parade of one shot villains like BATTY MAN, THE ELECTRIC EEL and assorted aliens. Distributed by TOTAL TELEVISON PRODUCTIONS, the show featured a snappy theme song, crude, simple animation not unlike ROCKY & BULLWINKLE (though it lacked that show's cerebral pun-riddeled wit) and short cliffhanger episodes moved along by an earnest off screen narrator. Indian mischief makers GO GO GOPHERS and tall tale adventurer COMMANDER MCBRAGG were among the other ""Short Subjects"" on hand, making UNDERDOG one of Saturday morning's most heroic efforts throughout the sixties and forever after in syndication.

4886838,3,B005SQRYG4,"""Underdog"" remains one of my favorite childhood memories, and he's been poorly served over the years on video and DVD.  This new collection, claiming to restore the program to its original format, does a better job, and at LEAST gives us the entire series in one fell swoop.  But I'm skeptical that these programs are really ""as aired.""  Each consists of two chapters of an Underdog story, with one full-sized short, and one mini-short (Commander McBragg.)  Most do not even consist of the program's opening.  All tolled, this amounts to about nineteen minutes worth of program, roughly six minutes short of what a thirty minute episode was in 1964.

The bonus features are okay, but perhaps we would have been better served with just a featurette of comic historian Mark Arnold with Alison Arngrim (daughter of Sweet Polly Purebred voice Norma McMillan) rather than dividing it up between three unrelated shorts.",1382486400,3,913,5.013245033112582

4886862,4,B005SQRYG4,"I agree with most other posters that this collection is fantastic in regards to providing you with ever single episode of Underdog, which is awesome in itself.

However, I too, am disappointed with the poor quality of some of the footage. The Commander Mcbragg openings and closings in particular. Very poor and shotty video quality indeed and it really detracts from the overall presentation of an episode.

Additionally, I've now watched about 10-12 episodes, and I'm somewhat upset by the formulaic presentation of that material. We are typically only provided with one Underdog theme sequence (the Giant one), when I know there's at least 3 (Simon Bar Sinister and Rift Raft ones). I don't understand why they couldn't pepper in different ones for different episodes or rotate them around to add variety to the presentation of the material. Then again..they could have done this...I don't think I've watched a Simon Bar Sinister or Rift Raft episode yet...so maybe these episodes are given these villain openings specifically, and the giant one is saved for all the rest. Still though, even if that's the case, I would have rather seen it presented differently.

Also, I'm somewhat upset that they left out the ""Tune in next week for the next Underdog show"" bumper at the end of the episodes as well. It may be just a little thing but it was a part of the Underdog I grew up with so I would have liked to have seen it included.

Finally, I don't agree with other posters about the exclusion of Tennessee Tuxedo from these episodes. Maybe that was done intentionally to cash in on the separate DVD set of those episodes, but again, for me, Underdog and Tennessee Tuxedo were a package deal growing up. Just like Go Go Gophers, you really couldn't break these shows apart and still have the same program.

I would have liked to see one super massive DVD set with everything, instead of two separate box sets.",1334707200,2,1910,4.775757575757575

Otherwise, very pleased with the set.  I, for one, am glad Tennessee Tuxedo wasn't included: Those segments always seemed out of place to me any way, and they weren't funny.  Good job, SHOUT!",1333584000,,452,4.397590361445783
4886864,5,B005SQRYG4,"Having grown up in the late 70s-early 80s, my memories of Underdog were the syndicated versions on my local UHF station of channel 38. Watching these shows proves how butchered and cut up they were through the years. According to the little booklet inside these are indeed how the shows were originally broadcast so those looking for Tennesse Tuxedo and the upbeat jazzy end credits will have to look elsewhere. The source material varies from episode to episode but let's face it, some of these cartoons are nearly 50 years old and folks just didn't see a future for them. I still use a tube type television so it didn't make much of a difference to me so those with HD TVs be forewarned. The Underdog episodes themselves for the most part are pretty funny, witty and clever. He's still a bit of a screw up and leaves messes just to defeat his enemies which is a gag the Powerpuff Girls took and ran with. All 3 Underdog theme interstitials are present and are usually a good guide to who or what Underdog will be facing. There is no censorship that I could see and I am 3 discs in. You also get the Go Go Gopers cartoons, many however are missing their title cards. I found myself skipping these since I just didn't find them funny. Commander McBragg is present and it is his titles that suffer the most quality wise. Since so many of the cast have passed away it was a bit of shock to see commentary from some of the survivors as well as one of the creators (sorry, don't recall the names at the moment). All in all, it's a fun little show, a product of its time, nothing objectionable in my opinion and a great trip down memory lane.",1333152000,3,1637,4.370491803278688
4886865,2,B005SQRYG4,"When this Underdog set was announced on pre-order besides stating it must have the original theme and the ""ring I fill with secret underdog energy pill"" I also begged Mark Arnold and Shout! that they not use DNR/DVNR. Well it was used and it's heavy handed and the effects are crap. I've never seen a case where it made anything look better regardless of issues that exist on the source material. DVNR has pretty much ruined this set. Very disappointing!

The folks at Shout! should talk to the crew at image who did Twilight Zone DVD and Blu-Ray for they are true professionals who do some of the industry's best mastering/transfer to digital work.

A generous 2 Stars - Why did they drown this in DNR/DVNR? Any semblance of detail has been lost. I have Underdog video tapes that actually have more fine detail. Why the low bit rate which results in artifact-ing and pixilation no excuse for that whatsoever it's amateurish. If not for Shout's and Mark Arnold effort in securing as much of the materials as they did it would not even merit a single star. A huge disappointment given those involved!",1330214400,6,1099,4.65979381443299
4886866,3,B005SQRYG4,"I had been looking forward to the release of the ""Complete Collector's Edition"" of Underdog from the time it was announced.  And while this set does have quite a lot going for it, there are many aspects that keep it from being the absolute definitive version fans of the show had hoped for.

This set *does* give you every episode of Underdog, Go Go Gophers, and Commander McBragg.  You also get 14 episodes of Klondike Kat, 12 of Tooter Turtle, and two featuring the Hunter.

And unlike past Underdog/Total TeleVision Productions DVDs that omitted the original theme songs for the supporting cartoons, this set has them intact.

Unfortunately, this is also where this set suffers from a visual standpoint, as many of the opening sequences were mastered from rather low-quality bootleg video tapes as opposed to the original film elements that the producers were not able to include.

Klondike Kat's two different openings are from a video source, as are the Hunter's and two of Commander McBragg's three.  (All three of the Commander McBragg's closing sequences, as well as Tooter Turtle's are from nth generation video tapes as well.)

Obviously, having these things in lesser-quality is better than not having them at all.  But, there are a few other issues that made me wonder how much effort was actually spent in trying to obtain the best-quality elements.

For example disc three has a bonus collection of original bumpers and the syndicated closing credits sequence (among other things).  One of the clips is of the ""in weeks to come"" promo that fans of the show are sure to remember.

This clip had previously been released on the old ""Ultimate Collection"" DVD set in pristine quality, yet on this supposedly improved set, the very same promo was mastered from video - in vastly inferior condition to what fans already have.

My question is *why*?  Why the downgrade in quality?  I would have thought this set would have been an upgrade over the ""Ultimate Collection"" in every way.  (The Ultimate Collection also has content that is not available on this set at all - like a network Thanksgiving Day promo.)

As for the main video content, the episodes appear to have been compressed too much as artifacts are quite common.  Fine lines and small details are often obliterated in shots that have lots of quick action.  (Especially noticeable during the Go Go Gopher cartoons.)

The ""Complete Collection"" does restore most of the title cards and episode recaps that had been omitted from the past DVD collections, but not all of them.  ""The Phoney Booths"" and ""Batty Man"" still do not have their original title screens/recaps.  Eight episodes of Go Go Gophers are missing their original title screens as well.  (A few random cartoons even have newly-created, non-original title screens, but just a handful.)

As I was going through the discs, I also noticed many titles were misspelled on the cases, and one entire episode (""Whistler's Father"") was completely misidentified (the packaging identifies it as ""Guerilla Warfare"").  Again, this is minor in itself, but it did make me wonder what kind of quality control was going on when this set was assembled.

Another oversight was made in regards to one of the Hunter cartoons.

The set was supposed to include something called ""Statue of Liberty Play"", but a disclaimer pops up at its spot on the disc saying that after the packaging had been printed it was discovered the audio for this cartoon could not be located and that a film called ""Hula Hoop Havoc"" was being substituted.  (All well and good, but even the disclaimer misspelled that title too (as ""Hula Hoop Havok"").)

Granted, much of this review is quite nitpicky.  These are just the small details that Amazon's blurbs tend to overlook, but details that many animation fans care about.

All in all, this is not a bad Underdog collection, and it's probably the most thorough one we're going to get at this stage.",1330128000,176,3930,4.891238670694864
4886867,4,B005SQRYG4,"A brief review. I am a huge underdog fan and have old TV-VHS recordings from local affiliates in the late 80s along with the more recent repackaged episodes from Boomerang. I also have all of the official prior releases so far on DVD. While it it is great to see the video cleaned up, it seems like the folks who are involved are not true fans as they inevitably blow it by not including the original bumpers or omitting the episode intro narration (on the last episode, we saw underdog...). I am glad to say that Mark Arnold who is the author of a booklet included with this set and a book on the TTV company responsible for Underdog, Tennessee Tuxedo and the rest of the TTV stable does not fit this stereotype. I own his book and it was a great read, he obviously is knowledgeable about the subject and his review here attests to a few of the minor problems with this set, please see it for additional info. While this release has all of the known episodes, some of the problems with prior releases are still present. I am not happy with the fade out and fade in titles between episodes, which are not the originals. I was also hoping for more behind the scenes material. I still gave this 4 stars because it is the first time ever that the complete series has been available on DVD. If you enjoyed the show, you need this set. I hope to see it sometime down the road as I saw it in the 60s and 70s, complete with period-correct titles, bumpers, etc. Until then, I am glad to have this.",1330041600,6,1489,4.283687943262412

All the previous tapes and dvds while having great art work on the packaging have been severely edited removing narration,episode cliffhangers and the theme song. The prints of the episodes are bright and colorful as if the show was created in the past year not close to fifty years ago in 1964. As stated on the packaging and dvds themselves the individual cartoon segments especially the World of Commander McBragg vary from episode to episode but those segments are quite watchable. The bonus material discussing the creation of The Underdog Show are informative.
