6463574,5,B00L2YXXC0,"This was a great movie and a great introduction of Kim Woo Bin into adult movies! Sorry, not into the HS dramas and movies so this was a big treat to finally see him acting! He did a great job in blending in with the more seasoned actors. He didn't overshine them but he definitely left his mark. The movie was a great follow-up to the previous. But beware, there is seamless time jumps here and there and if you are not careful, you'll get lost in the stories but overall it was a wonderful movie!!",1411084800,3,499,4.208333333333333

6463615,4,B00L2YXXC0,"Kim Woo Bin is an amazing actor and it's refreshing to see him play a more mature role. I fell in love with him and his acting when I watched 'Heirs'. After watching that I wanted to see what other roles he'd be good at besides the basic bad boy teenager. I haven't seen the first installment of the movie, but I've heard it's very good. Once I get another break from classes I will be checking it out. Sorry if I sound a little starstruck, but once I find an amazing actor I support them to the fullest.",1411257600,,504,4.101010101010101

Woo Bin plays and excellent gangster with good action sequences and will bring you to tears on other parts I would recommend this movie to anyone.,1411257600,2,252,4.382978723404255
6463697,4,B00L2YXXC0,"This is an awesome gangster movie with a solid dramatic story. I went in without seeing the original ""Friend"" (Chingu) and was worried it wouldn't make sense...but it's only loosely related to the first one and they'll explain everything you need in the first few minutes. I'll admit I only went to see it because of Kim Woo Bin but his acting was really sharp and his satoori dialect was well done and actually kind of fun (even for an English speaker)...he's such a punk in this movie! I highly recommend for anyone who likes some rock 'em, sock 'em action with a little human pathos thrown in for good measure.",1411257600,,613,4.531531531531532
6463698,5,B00L2YXXC0,I'm amazed by this! No words to describe this ,1411257600,,46,4.111111111111111

6463732,5,B00L2YXXC0,"This movie did not disappoint one bit! loved the action filled bad boy vibe
from beginning to end i was on my toes and loved the character Kim Woo Bin played
After watching this movie in the theater i rushed back home so i could watch the first movie!
This movie is a must see!",1411257600,2,277,4.054545454545455
6463733,5,B00L2YXXC0,"I have to say Kim Woo Bin has definitely shined on screen again, his acting on point and his intense expressions that his sunbaes in the movie already knew how to capture were just as powerful as his. I've seen Woo Bin in many dramas and till this day, I am amazed and just in awe of his acting (despite being a model), his expressions, his movements within the film and from his strides, he fit his character very well and was excellent with rough, action scenes and confrontations with many of the characters within the drama. Like the reviewer previously has stated before me, Kim Woo Bin didn't outshine the rest of his acting seniors in the movie, but he definitely left another mark in the film industry. I was a bit concerned of whether or not this movie will do just as well as its predecessor, but boy was I wrong! The intense scenes, the acting and action scenes drew chemistry from all the actors/actresses within the film and this film definitely did an excellent job with the sequel. Kudos to Kim Woo Bin who continues to do excellent work in the acting field and I can't wait to watch and support more of his work!",1411171200,,1128,4.427884615384615

6463737,4,B00L2YXXC0,"This movie was a great sequel to its predecessor: Friend. An abundance of profanities and over the top gangster sequences, that are beyond extreme, fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. After seeing this film I would say it was one of the most fun Korean thrillers I've watched to date! It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality, as well as a decent plot.

For a popcorn flick this film boasts a great cast. Yu Oh-seung gives a wonderfully wretched delivery as the big boss, while Joo Jin-mo gives a sublime portrayal of his father. Rounding out the primary cast is Kim Woo-bin who plays the character Choi Sung-hoon; the son or a rival gang leader. Known for playing the ""bad-boy"" role in many K-dramas, I think Woo-bin hit a major high-point in this film! While I am Kim Woo-bin biased (I could find a good side to any role he portrays), I can honestly say that I was taken aback by his stamina in this movie. He showcased his acting abilities on a whole new scale, giving us all a taste of his silver-screen charisma and in a way that was both familiar yet still surprising to audiences.

Now for the bad news...As well developed as the INDIVIDUAL characterization in this movie was, I can't help but to feel that as a WHOLE the characters had no chemistry between one another. This is most prevalent in the relationship between Yu Oh-Seung's character, Joon-seok, and Kim Woo-bin's character, Sung-hoon. Sung-hoon is very purport towards Joon-seok throughout the fiilm, which would make you think that Joon-seok would in turn be very contentious towards him but instead he's rather nonchalant. The indifference between the two took away from the (gripping) bromantic tendencies in the first film. It's one of the core reasons I loved Friend so much, as I am always drawn into a plot when I can actually feel hidden emotion between characters that may/may not have been written into the script. On top of the lack of compatibility, there is also a  handful of sub plots going on at the same time as the main plot. I think the director tried to help viewers follow each one by guiding them through a series of back-and-forth time lapses, however, I feel this may have further confused some people ().

When you watch this movie just sit back, relax, and enjoy the rush! It is definitely a must have for fans of Friend, mobster movies, or any of the wonderful actors in the cast. Kyung-Taek Kwak has written what I would consider to be definitely another blockbuster hit! ^^",1411171200,2,2526,4.65695067264574

I have watched several times already and have shared it with my own friends who have enjoyed it so much that they searched and found Friend I on-line on Youtube.

The ever handsome and sexy Kim Woo Bin is candy to the eyes.  I love the fact that he is a very manly actor in this movie (such a turn on).  But, then again everything I have seen he in he is manly.  He acts the way a man his age should act (more realistic).  The I am so shy and scare of females that mostly portrayed in Korea Dramas get on my nerve after a while.",1437955200,,568,3.8956521739130436
