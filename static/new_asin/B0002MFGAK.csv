2104369,1,B0002MFGAK,"A show about annoying,whiny brats saving the world from adults...whoever thought up THIS garbage should have their head examined. In the entire series,you put up with constant whining,sniveling and sheer stupidity as 5 noisy brats run around annoying everyone arounsd them and generally being up to no good. Cheap animation and no plots make ""Kids Next Door"" an unbearable torture for veiwers. This series is so irritating that it would make Bart Simpson throw himself into a volcano.

If you want entertaining funny kids,get ""Dennis the Menace"" instead.",1095033600,5,554,5.295454545454546

2104391,2,B0002MFGAK,"Codename: Kids Next Door is honestly one of the most inspired shows I've had the pleasure of watching in my lifetime. It's funny, it's charming, it's imaginative, it's got clever satire and film references, it's a great time for almost anyone who appreciates pure imagination and is willing to let go and have a fun ride.

However, with that said, I can't really recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the show enough to look on Amazon. While it could have served as a decent season one set, there are episodes missing and what is left is out of order. Add on that Cartoon Network only ever released sixteen episodes on DVD, and you're setting yourself up for disappointment if you want a complete set of the show.

My recommendation? Purchase the series on iTunes. It may be a steeper price, especially if you want the full series, but it's perfect for having the episodes on the go (especially if you have kids) and in full high quality.",1427068800,2,939,4.583333333333333

2104397,5,B0002MFGAK,"This show is as clever and imaginative as it was when I watched it as a child. I STILL want to be a Kids Next Door operative so badly it's not even funny.

...Well actually, it might be a little funny.

I really hope that they will actually release season DVDs for this series because just selling DVDs with 12 episodes isn't doing it for me.",1347321600,,342,4.166666666666667
2104398,5,B0002MFGAK,"First off reading through the reviews, some people obviously never got the point. Growing up either bitter or sheltered most of their live. We'll all pat you on the head and say it's okay. No, really, it's okay. Not having an imagination must be tough....Okay over it. Now on with the real review.

Next the show was brilliantly written. I was a kid growing up with that type of imagination. Pretending to be spies and thinking that parents conspired against their kids to do things they didn't want to do. Of course the generation now wouldn't know anything about them. They have apps now for their phones that creates imagination. *rolls eyes* I followed the show from beginning to end. It was one of my favorites from the character concepts to the missions and villains. It was the perfect show. People who say it targeted adults seriously need to get their priorities straight. You must have forgotten what it was like to be a kid, that or you had no friends growing up and had a sock puppet as your companion before you developed social issues. One or the other, you live with it.

Granted it wasn't to the standards of what people think is animation these days it was hands down the best representation of US Animation. For those who don't get it, this one is for you kids. CARTOONS!!! Shows like DBZ, Naruto, and the other ones are Japanese Anime. Of course it's not going to be the same. Your comparing two different things. KND brought back great animation from animators in North America that had both a sense of humor and story. The imagination behind it proved that there was actual thought put into it, instead of just some random story to bring in giggles and cheap pops for the simple minded. Everything from the Weapons, The Characters, the Tree Houses and missions, were all creative.

This show was flawless, and is still better then most of the garbage on today. If people shot it down with their mindless comments and reviews of non relevance then you were too slow to understand the concept and figure out the story. It made you look foolish. For that you FAILED! Massively.

Hands down KIDS NEXT DOOR will be one of my Top 5 shows ever right up there with Scooby Doo, Yogi Bear and other great North American Cartoons. I will not place this in Anime, because lets be serious, This isn't Japan, and we definitely know it wasn't targeted towards them. For that is another review I can break down as well.

It's too bad I could only give it 5 stars. Too me personally this one was worth so much more.

Cheers",1296259200,,2527,4.542857142857143
2104418,1,B0002MFGAK,"And Power Puff Girls or Samurai Jack. WB should just put out complete seasons of their shows,it's going to take forever to release this show on DVD at the rate they're going now .It's possible that they are planning to release all six seasons on the 10th anniversary like Power Puff Girls,let's hope anyway.

2104419,5,B0002MFGAK,"Kids Next Door is an amazing cartoon. The characters are interesting and so are the villains. You'll spend hours laughing and enjoy every minute of it. The show has acronyms in the beginning of each episode which  are clever and funny. Each acronym gives the viewer an idea of what will be happening in the episode. From giant lice to a giant ice cream monster. This show has it all! It even has giant robots, cool weapons which is called 2 X 4 technology. If you like cartoons this cartoon is for you!
Kids Next Door Battle Stations!! This DVD offers a great collection of episodes from season 1. It even features the season 1 finale operation g.r.o.w.u.p.! And a bonus cartoon in the special features.",1278460800,2,703,4.579365079365079
2104420,5,B0002MFGAK,"I agree with a lot of the POSITIVE reviews. This show is really great because it's funny, clever and entertaining. The only reason why some would view it as ""bad"" is because they take it way too seriously. The thing is: cartoons are meant to be oddly proportioned, funny qualities (accents, personalities, etc.) are all part of characterization and the plot of this cartoon is based solely on FICTION.

One can easily admit that kids don't need to fight adults, or that it's ridiculous to fear the dentist. It's up to the viewer if they'll let those principles sink in. The main point is that this cartoon is meant to be from the perspective of a CHILD. A lot of kids tend to view the world in hilariously delusional ways and this cartoon portrays it in the most ADORABLE way!

I won't recommend anything. All I leave is my opinion that this cartoon is WONDERFULLY CREATIVE.",1204156800,2,874,4.596153846153846
2104421,4,B0002MFGAK,"(I know this review is a little ""overdue"", but please bear with me.  *Ahem*)

From Curious Pictures, the studio that brought you ""Sheep in the Big City"", comes a group of very young and very heroic children known as the ""Kids Next Door"".  Their mission: to make the world a better place for kids with no adults to spoil it.  Out from their ginormous treehouse and into the big, big world, Numbuhs 1 through 5 of Sector V will put an end to the tyranny of adults, as well as teenagers and other rebellious youngsters like The Delightful Children From Down the Lane, thanks to their numerous and ingenious inventions known as their ""2x4 technology"".

In this Jam-packed DVD, you will find nine episodes such as ""Operation: I SCREAM"" (The KND infiltrates an ice cream factory to stop a sinister plot.), ""Operation: LICE"" (Giant hair-eating lice infest the treehouse.),  ""Operation: SUPPORT"" (Numbuhs 1 and 2 search Numbuh 5's sister's room for a strange defense garment.), and the two-parter ""Operation: GROW UP"" (The Delightful Children turn Numbuh 1 into an adult !).

Also on this DVD are some great features like ""2x4 Technology Specs"" where you get a glimpse of some of the coolest inventions fabricated from the world of the Kids Next Door.  Another feature is exclusive cheat codes for the Game Boy Advance game ""Operation SODA"".  And, of course, they've thrown in a bonus cartoon of ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"".  (In case you were wondering, it's the part one of three of the ""House of Bloo's"" premiere movie.  You can see the whole movie in its entirety on the ""Foster's Home: Season One"" DVD set.)

This DVD is nice, but many more episodes, as does brand new ones coming soon, will still be on Cartoon Network on your TV and online on Cartoon Network Video.  There was supposed to be a volume 2 DVD available now, but it's on a much longer hiatus than I thought.  Keep watching Cartoon Network for more updates.

2104422,5,B0002MFGAK,"I was surprised to see kids who didn't like this cartoon.  I bet that they grow up to be adults who don't watch cartoons. This has got to be one of my all time favorites and I have been watching cartoons for almost half a century now.  If only kids could band together and fight adult tyranny . . . what a concept.  Yet they aren't mini adults and these aren't James Bond adventures.  Saving someone who accidently ingests a brussel sprout while listening to the boring adult conversation at dinner is ingenious and so is the way they save him.  To Noelani (cool name!)  Nigel's parents actually do have British accents.  But they are goofy.  I think if we are to the point of criticising the character's accents, we are beyond just enjoying the show for what it is.  It isn't Shakespeare people!  What it is is a good old fashioned cartoon with heros, comedy, tragedy, slapstick, morals, and hey wait a minute!  Maybe it is Shakespeare.  <G>  Stick to Ed,Ed and Eddy if that's your cup of tea, but I wish someone would put this show out on dvd, like yesterday.  KND Rule!",1170460800,5,1072,4.430769230769231

2104424,5,B0002MFGAK,"First off I wanted to say, I will not argue with any of your opinions in this review. if you hate the show, fine, you have the freedom to hate it. Although I strongly disagree with how you are looking at it. Oh, and by the way everyone, Numbuh 4&nbsp;&nbsp;is AUSTRAILIAN not British. Thank you for the concern. Anyways, as one of the reviewers wrote...it isn't about people killing people that are the fears. Did we have to worry about that when we were 10? No! Kids fears are health, gross foods, girls, cooties&nbsp;, and much more. These are the issues that the Kids in the show are facing, just because we aren't facing them doesn't mean they aren't. We have to seperate reality from fantasy, people! I am a 15 year old girl who has just started watching KND about a year ago. I now have watched almost every episode because it has become such a great obsession. The voice talents are incredible, I mean come on, how many of you can pull an accent like #3 has if you are over age 40??? And Numbuh 4 is just the dreamiest kid in the world! I think it's great how all the characters have such different personalities instead of being all the same. It's a great adventure show, and I'm sure if you give it a chance you'll love it. Thank you :D",1151193600,11,1245,4.3247863247863245
2104425,1,B0002MFGAK,"I hate this show it is not aproproit for any adinces beacuse it insults adults. As a kid this show sucks adults help kids and without them every kid in the world whould be dead! The members of the kids next door are extremly rude and they are not smart they say number nubah? That is just stupid who wants to watch a show were pepole can't spell. The show also has no point in one epsoide numbah 4 ate a peice of carot and they thought it was the end of the world beacuse it whould make him like adults. Why whould he eat carots if he hates them so much. Stay away from this peice of crap and watch better shows like Edd Ed N eddy, Naruto, Bo-boo-boo-bo-bo, Fosters home for imaganery friends, Dragon ball z, and Zatch Bell. Those shows rock this is crasp don't buy or watch the show ever!",1142208000,3,789,4.12987012987013
2104436,5,B0002MFGAK,"I'm 28 and I love this cartoon.  It's corny and at times it's pretty stupid but the pure ridiculousness of it is what makes it so entertaining.  I love the concept of 2x4 technology and having guns that shoot condiments, ice cream, gum balls etc...  is classic!  Not to mention the robots and other vehicles that are made of everyday things like carousels, cars, school lockers, and even a chimney!  Codname KND puts a great spin on the action cartoons of the twenty first century. No blood, no guts - just plain fun and gags that can be appreciated by children of all ages.  Also, the constant spoofs on classic movies; Robin Hood, Star Wars, Terminator, etc... is entertaining to adults who watch with their children (or by themselves!)  I'm a lifelong lover of cartoons and although I really didn't like Codename KND the first few times I watched it I eventually came to love it and now watch it every chance I get.  I've also converted a few of my adult cartoon loving friends into fans.

As for the animation style - it's true that the characters are drawn pretty amusingly.  They look like pencils with apples stuck on them for heads, hands and feet but instead of complaining about the style take it for what it is.  The entire cartoon is a spoof and the way it's drawn emphasizes that.

A comment on the accents of the characters;  While reading through other reviews I noticed many complaints on how fake the British accent of Numbah One sounds.  As stated in the previous paragraph - this is a spoof and how much more ridiculous would Numbah One sound if he had been voiced by someone with a real British accent?  Could you seriously imagine Hugh Laurie reading the part?  I believe that a real British accent would get even more complaints and besides, if you actually watched the cartoon you'd realize that neither of Numbah One's parents have an accent which would clue you in - he's just a kid trying to be cool as so many kids do.  I've never heard a convincing accent come out of a child's mouth without extensive training.  And to bash on Numbah Four's accent, calling it a bad British accent, is further proof that you don't watch the show.  Numbah Four is Australian.

The characters all have distinct personalities and their individuality is part of what makes them so fun.  Watching this cartoon takes me back to my own childhood, back when cartoons were only on Saturday morning and for an hour or two after school.  Back before Nintendo and Xbox...  When our imagination was all we had and we used it to the point of frying our brains.  Today's youth can't always appreciate a cartoon like Codename KND because they can't necessarily relate.  If you don't like it that's okay and feel free to trash it all you want, that's your right and I recognize your right.  We all have different opinions and I love that amazon gives us the ability to share our opinions.  Don't use these review spaces to put down the other reviewers though - that is immature and unnecessary.  Who cares if someone misspells a word?  I'm sure that I've misspelled quite a few words in my own review!  Also, if someone writes a review that you don't agree with don't trash the person, just write your own review and leave it alone.  Allow the consumer to make the choice don't try to sway them to your way of thinking.  The purpose of these reviews is to share your opinion of the item in question with the intent of informing people of what it is they're considering purchasing.

I love Codename KND and I reccomend this cartoon to cartoon lovers everywhere!",1131235200,38,3555,4.556782334384858
2104437,4,B0002MFGAK,"I would just like to say that the 13 year old boy that reviewed this cartoon is no authority on this show.  I personally feel that this is a pretty funny and original cartoon.  There's a lot of really boring cartoons out there and I find this one quite entertaining.  So, give it a try.  If you like goofy cartoons you'll like this one.",1130544000,17,336,4.203125
2104438,3,B0002MFGAK,"While not an amazing show it is clever and funny enough to entertain a lot of different age groups.  One of the things that work in the formula is the fact that there are a lot of different pop culture refences such as:

1. Star Wars: The Empire strikes back

2. The Animatrix: The second renaissance parts 1&2

3. The Terminator

The only group of people I can see not having any fun with this show is those who take themselves and TV in general WAY too seriously.

But I will agree with some of the naysayers; the characters is a bit odd in terms of the proportions of the hands and feet compared to the rest of the body.

As for the storylines in the KND; it's light and fun and those who question the logic of it and how it relates to reality are thinking a lot more about it then the writter's have.  It's meant to play on what young kids know about the world - their dreams and fears.

Either love it or hate it, it's here to stay (for now).  As for me, you can call me number 867-5309!",1126828800,6,992,4.06701030927835
2104439,5,B0002MFGAK,"First, I would like to say that Kid's Next Door is one of the funniest cartoons that is around today.

Second, I would like to say that I found the 13-year-old's review (posted on April 27, 2005) very interesting.

In the Kid's Next Door, when the child turns thirteen they are brainwashed of all their experiences with the Kids Next Door and they become a bunch of stupid teenagers.

Think about it, the reviewer was thirteen years old, he USED to like the show, but now he doesn't, he recommends dentists, he says that the villains in the show are not threats and that the characters in the show are immature.

Could it be that that reviewer was a brainwashed Kid's Next Door operative?

It's worth thinking about, at any rate...",1124409600,15,731,4.549618320610687
2104440,5,B0002MFGAK,"First I would like to say that Operation: KND is one of my favorite american made cartoons at the moment. I plan on buying the dvds for my self as well as the younger people in my family. I would totaly recomend this for kids of all ages.

Now, to the 13 year old reviewer that was nothing but negitive:

- your a child of the 90's....try spell checking once and a while...if you cant find the button use a dictionary.

- its a well known fact that KND first appeared on the WB network in 1999, not CN in 2001.

- yet another well known fact: CN hardly shows KND in any order what so ever. So its hard to follow the well laid out story arch of the series.

- Dentists ARE scary from a kids point of view...but your a big boy now aren't you? Ofcourse your not scared of having a root canal or even a filling.

-The voice actors in this show are awsome...especially they lady that does Numbuh 3....oh thats right your 13 lets see.. whos voice is messed up when you hit your ""awkward"" stage.

- Lastly I and every other person who will buy this dvd will want to watch this show. It a cleverly written cartoon thats entertains young people and adults. With well designed characters and many gratuitous references to things that predate your existance ( you know there was a world pre-1990.) make it a very fun show to watch",1117756800,15,1319,4.231075697211155
