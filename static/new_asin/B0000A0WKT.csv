7995250,2,B0000A0WKT,"Tom and his brother are part owners of a company that is getting ready to launch a new colone, ""Blue Noir"" which ""drives women crazy."" The company has financial problems of which playboy, gambling addict Tom seems to be the main one. Tom (Mailon Rivera) loves to be in a relationship and always cheats. A former girlfriend Lauren Amber (Ellen Cleghorne), whom he cheated on, is working to bring down the company.

The writers seemed a bit confused as the movie ranged from light comedy to bad drama and did so in a haphazard fashion. Once the film got going, it was tolerable, with one or two funny moments. The plot and characters were not that well developed. There were also scenes that made you scratch your head and wonder if it was a joke or just bad writing such as Lauren's checklist in plain block letters of a simple 5 step plan to take over the company. The script did not allow for good acting. Angelle Brooks struggled to look presentable.
