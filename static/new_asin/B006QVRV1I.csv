5013816,5,B006QVRV1I,"I thought the documentary was great!  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Being someone who loves all things fashion, this was a trip down memory lane to the 70's, when Halston ruled fashion.  I thought the director did a really unique job in presenting the documentary, it kept it from being boring.  If you are a fashionista you will love Whitney Smiths ""Ultrasuede""!!!",1339977600,3,366,4.761904761904762
5013817,1,B006QVRV1I,"I gave up watching this poorly edited, poorly researched documentary after 10 minutes. I have no idea why Whitney Smith was so interested in Halston; his mother thinks is because he loved to watch Smokey and the Bear. WHAT??? Like the 10 minutes of this film I could stand, that was bewildering and off-putting.

Smith interviews Liza Minelli and tells her she was Halston's only friend at the time he died; she corrects him, and says that Liz Taylor, among others was there. She says she gave Halston his memorial service; Smith asks her what she sang; Liza replies that she didn't sing because the event was about Halston, not her. Couldn't Smith have looked up any newspaper clippings of the event?

He finds Halston's archives in boxes, unpacked at a Bible university in Nashville. Georgette Mosbacher, the head of Halston/Borghese, says her mother lives in Nashville, which is why I'm assuming the archives went there; she can deduct the cost of seeing her mother as a business expense to 'check on the archives'. Smith remarks that he has seen the archives, but doesn't ask why nothing has been done with them. No displays, the boxes were basically thrown in a room. Mosbacher obviously doesn't know or care what is being done to preserve the archives, and Smith isn't interested in enlightening her. Why?

Smith has lunch with Andre Leon Talley, and, again, hasn't done his research. He asks ALT who else he should interview! He also interrupts ALT, but is put in his place. Also, the racist anthem 'Dixie' is Smith's ring tone, and he has the Confederate flag on his license plate. I'm sure it's just a Southern Pride thing, right?

I had to turn off the movie when Smith wears aviator sunglasses, inside, to interview Ralph Rucci.

Please let someone else make a documentary of quality about Halston! This one surely cannot be the last word.",1339200000,19,1850,4.786833855799373

5013899,4,B006QVRV1I,"It wasn't as terrible as I anticipated based on other reviews. But my motivation was to not to know more about Halston. It was, rather, to observe more of WSS who I knew of from the reality TV show Southern Charm. He unknowingly created a self documentary while trying to document Halston. Pity WSS - narcissistic laughable clueless poseur. I actually cringe and wince for him.",1462752000,,377,4.7272727272727275
5013900,4,B006QVRV1I,"Horridly uneven documentary - ranges from decent to painful. The host/producer is embarrassing to watch at times BUT at least he made this, and I think he really does care about the subject. There is NO other documentary readily available on one of America's most important designers. The interviews range from alright to awkward, but the information he gets is priceless. There are moments where the documentary really works, and then moments where you just cringe... but in the end thank goodness he did made this and got these interviews. You may not like the producer/host, but he put a fair amount of work into this, and this is one of the best sources of Halston's legacy (aside from some good books). I have watched it a few times because the information and archival footage is so fabulous. Even when the interviews are awkward, they are still fun to watch.",1462665600,,865,4.773333333333333

I couldn't care less about the filmmaker/interviewer who narrates and appears throughout the film, but I love seeing the old footage of Halston, Pat Cleveland and the ""Halstonettes."" There's not much substance here, and in better hands, some of the interviewees could have yielded some interesting material, but it is what it is.

5013928,1,B006QVRV1I,"I wanted to view this film after reading that the producer of Ultrasuede had strongly (and wrongly) inserted himself into the storyline. I was curious as to how he tried to manage a sense of objectivity but in reality the whole movie comes down to being solely about his own confused, narcissistic life, not Halston's. And it is a bizarre approach given that his likability quotient from the get go is pretty much zero stars. It helps a little that Sudler-Smith shows early on that he is from a very wealthy family in Charleston where as a child, according to  his mother, watching Smokey and The Bandit re-runs nourished his precocious interest in fashion. It also explains why there seems to be no budgetary restraints in place during production and post-production. I picture an immaculate cutting room floor. As for  pre-production costs it appears that no money was spent in this phase since Sudler-Smith  is perpetually clueless when it comes to the what is supposed to be the subject of his movie. The many famous people he interviewed were likely lined up through the Charleston matriarch connection but boy were they lined up! Lots of famous faces. But he goes into the interviews so ill informed that the interviewees, such as Liza Minnelli, must correct and inform him regarding the most basic aspects of Halston's life. It's as if Sudler-Smith's research had consisted of  hearing over a couple of drinks that the 1970s in NYC was a fun decade and whoo hoo Studio 54. Me like sex, drugs and disco music! Look at me!!
One could try to label the movie as a self serving ironic camp comedy but given Sudler-Smith's ""Dixie"" ring tone and the confederate flag on the license plate of his car that he zoom-zooms  around NYC, it's difficult to see any aspect of this person as funny - or acceptable.
Perhaps one star is deserved for the tour of Halston's NYC house. Not worth the 2 dollar rental fee though.
A startling moment that allows Sudler-Smith's arrogance and questionable character to brightly shine through is when he walks through the doors of the offices of Vogue Magazine and mumbles with a smile that he prefers Teen Vogue. Sudler-Smith is in his mid to late 40s. Just wonder how he felt okay about making a mockery out of Halston.",1429574400,3,2250,4.729591836734694
5013929,1,B006QVRV1I,"The only moment noteworthy is watching Andre' Leon Talley realize he is speaking to an absolute idiot!  I would not advise anyone watch even for that moment though.  Surely you have better things to do with your time.  The filmmaker/interviewer doesn't seem to know who Halston is or anything about his contributions to the fashion industry or pop culture.  The material presented in the documentary is disjointed and the subject of Halston actually seems to be a pretext for the interviewer just to appear onscreen in bad fashion, bad hairstyles, and a replica of the car from Smokey and the Bandit series of movies.",1425513600,4,617,4.903846153846154
5013930,2,B006QVRV1I,"Re-edited with a different interviewer, this has the potential to be a GREAT documentary on a great subject.  Cut out everything with the film maker showing himself and asking questions that he clearly didn't research beforehand and you have good material.  How did he manage to get to sit down with these people?  Liza?  And for her to tell him the apartment (designed by Halston) was on the cover of Architectural Digest...to which he replied ""It was!?""  Oh God.  It just goes on from there.  I'm not entirely convinced it's not Mike Birbiglia doing some sort of conceptual art.",1421625600,2,580,4.797979797979798
5013931,1,B006QVRV1I,"I stopped watching this film after about 15 minutes. I was so looking forward to an interesting look at an important American designer, but instead found an amateurish and narcissistic mess. What a waste. So much interesting material, but placed in the wrong hands. This guy's research is sloppy (when it even exists), and he's just plain silly at points. What is UP with that Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am?",1412899200,3,408,4.76056338028169

5013933,2,B006QVRV1I,"The glimpses of fashion, vintage footage and great interview subjects are the most redeeming quality of this film. The filmmaker on the other hand is a poser desperately seeking to revive a 70's hedonistic fantasy. His doom was clinched when he was asked if he wanted to be taken through a collection and he declines, admitting he watches the models and not the brilliant works which adorn them. If you love fashion his ineptitude is an annoyance worth suffering to get a look into a great fashion icon.",1405382400,,503,4.7272727272727275

5013935,3,B006QVRV1I,"""I shall let that pass, since you cannot possibly know whose leg it is that you are pushing."" - Inspector Clouseau

It must be difficult creating a biography of Halston when the ghost of the man himself appears to be breathing down everyone's neck. Whitney Sudler-Smith apparently finds this out the hard way in Ultrasuede, In Search Of Halston.

The rarefied high-society world of air kisses, haute couture, glittering parties and champagne excesses that are locked behind closed doors and kept silent with the secret nods of ""those who know"" is the environment which our oddly dressed Inspector Clouseau finds himself.  Sudler-Smith, who obviously used this movie as a springboard in order to get a deal for his new reality-TV show Southern Charm, uses precisely that very format as a way of engaging the audience, inviting them to come with him in search for the subject of the title, Roy Halston Frowick.

However, the most Sudler-Smith winds up doing is alienating himself even further from the compelling truth, the man behind the Halston mask (not to mention getting the Ultrasuede bitch-slapped out of him figuratively by Andre Leon Talley). He follows the road well-traveled and already paved by Steven Gaines before him, instead of detouring into dark territory and asking some very pertinent (and possibly painful) questions regarding the how and why of Halston's life, artistry, and legacy.

Key people are missing here. Halston's niece, Lesley Frowick, for one, along with friends Joel Schumacher; muse Elsa Peretti; his right-hand man, the late Bill Dugan (who was alive at the time of this filming); models Nancy North, Alva Chinn, and Karen Bjornson (all whom are still alive), along with others who could have imparted some insight on the logic and stimulus behind the man's design ethics. Andy Warhol himself sheds light on the designer with his books Exposures (1979) and The Andy Warhol Diaries(1989); books that I'm sure Sudler-Smith has not touched even once. This insight remains nebulous at best, and today Halston's aesthetic is interpreted by current designers at its minimalist surface, not taking into account the complicated sculptural and origami construction which shaped the dresses and skirts that he is so famous for. The work he did for Martha Graham is not even mentioned anywhere in the film. Halston's idiosyncrasies and eccentricities are only skimmed upon, unexplained, and his domestic background is all but skipped over. The key pieces of his life which would have revealed most, if not all, of the roots of his addictions and behavior are glaringly missing.

Stepping in for Warhol is Bob Colacello, who fills in some of the blanks with memories of the time which showcase Halston's heavy personality, along with Glenn O'Brien, whose time in the film is brief. Paul Wilmot enthusiastically speaks of Halston's involvement with the creation of his signature perfume, which made it one of the biggest selling perfumes of all time right behind Chanel No 5, proclaiming ""This is Halston at his best.""  Andre Leon Talley, along with one-time Halston assistants Ralph Rucci and Naeem Khan, more or less color in the other sides of Halston, with Talley and Rucci providing insight into this particular period and the dimensional technical workings behind the cuts which made Halston's designs so groundbreaking. Khan, along with speaking about his experiences in Studio 54, explains Halston's relationship with the fabrics and imparts the advice Halston gave Khan when apprenticing with the ubiquitous designer, ""The fabrics will teach you...it has to come in your dreams.""

However, these golden nuggets are lost in the parade of seedy Studio 54 gossip that streams through the second half of the film. Liza Minnelli plays a staunch gatekeeper to the secrets of that time, determined to play down the antics and exonerate her friend's memory in some way, only to be sharply contrasted (in a humorous manner) by the ""DuPont"" Twins, who dish about the nights of cocaine-fueled debauchery with gossipy-girl delight.  However, things turn dark and somber towards the end of Halston's tale; true confusion registers on the twins' faces regarding Halston's disappearance from the social scene in the late 80's, and Liza cannot hold back tears when she speaks of instinctively knowing when the end was near.  Other players in the film, such as Nicky Haslam and Billy Joel, are so out of place that they are practically useless. Shoddy editing limits the impact of Haslam, and others such as Boaz Mazur, who obviously had very interesting anecdotes but is obscured by Sudler-Smith's irritating and off-timed voice-overs. Poor restoration of early 70's archival footage also reduces the film's credibility, although I believe this had more to do with the archive's owners than the production team.

In the end, as Andre Leon Tally proclaims, ""What speaks is the work."" And if you look closely, it is indeed in the work of this prodigious artist where the true story of the man is revealed. It is one of ambition, love, determination, will, passion, and boundless, limit-breaking creativity and artistry that today is neither found, nor fully appreciated or even understood in this commerce-and-currency driven society (which ironically, he helped create). And at its heart is a man, deeply wounded in some way, who sought to escape the reality of who he was, for reasons we will never know - and by any means necessary.

5013936,1,B006QVRV1I,"Having worked with Halston in the 80s, I have to agree with the review by History Lover. This was a shallow and ill researched film which featured more of Whitney Smiths vapid egotism than the accomplishments of Halston himself. Despite his tragic fall from grace and demise, his accomplisments in his lifetime were many. He was a pioneer in fashion, in business, in licensing, worked to create a distinctive ""American"" look, and put American fashion front and center on the world stage. He supported the great choreographer Martha Graham and her company both personally and finacially till the end of his life. The enormous pressures of creating an maintaining an empire and a lifestyle that sought to relieve these pressures took a great toll. His life and accomplishments however, are deserving of a more thorough examination and presentation. Perhaps Mr Smith would have done better to do a documentary about Smokey the Bear.

There were so many grainy, out-of-focus clips that I wonder if the quality was intentionally altered for artistic effect. I would've preferred less focus on the interviewer himself.

My only advice is to not allow yourself to be bothered by the director, Whitney Sudler-Smith.  He seems awkward when interviewing people, and it's obvious sometimes that people are upset that he hasn't done enough research into this subject.  However, it says a lot about Halston that people have so much to say about him even when not prodded with probing questions, which Sudler-Smith evidently could not muster.",1364515200,,685,4.887931034482759

5013945,5,B006QVRV1I,"By the time I was old enough to know the name 'Halston', he was already in free fall. However, I could see the respect that the fashion world had for him. This documentary let me know why.

Halston was both an artist and a patriot. He tirelessly promoted American fashion, playing a pivotal role in putting US design on the European map. Halston traveled to China when it was as difficult to travel there as it is to North Korea today. He designed for the US Olympic team, and he dressed Jackie Kennedy on inauguration day.

Halston's achievements are impressive, and the different perspectives of the people interviewed for the documentary create a picture of a complex and fascinating individual. Although he made the crucial error of not protecting the prestige of his brand, this was a bad business decision. His artistic vision was genius. Most of all, he was a true innovator in a field where everyone else is just copying.",1363737600,,929,4.728395061728395

You will probably come away from this documentary wanting to know more about Halston but, I do get the impression that Halston may not have been that easy to know and that his uber simplistic designs of many hits (and quite a few misses in my opinion) makes it easy for him to be taken for granted as well as his talent and his style and his rise to fame. The one thing that I did get from this documentary is why he was famous, I think he was famous because he absolutely believed in everything he did, and it seems to me everything had to be completely luxurious, as far as bringing simplistic luxury to the masses I think it was a big miss calculation Halston's people wanted a peice of the dreamn not the poor persons version of it. He would have been better off doubling the price of his perfume (affordable luxury, like expensive lipstick) and leaving the clothes to the people with money. In the end I think he just took himself a little too seriously. Keep it real and don't believe the hype especially if it's your own.",1363651200,,1228,4.297413793103448

I did not find him to be so. He presents himself as a clod initially, however it is impossible that he ACTUALLY is because the movie is so well made. The movie is beautifully crafted, points are illustrated rather than screamed and underlined, and it's up to the viewer to notice and draw conclusions. I loved the way Georgette Mosbacher is shown up for the barbarian she is, for example. I loved the way his friends faces lighted up when they spoke of Halston, and I loved the way the movie showed us the joy and genius of Halstons work, and the sadness of his decline yet it didn't tell us what to think or feel. Angelica Hustons comments were particularly moving, I thought.  I'm not sure exactly what Sudler Smiths Camero and all his wigs had to do with Halstons story, but for some reason they worked for me. It seemed like Sudler Smiths props and assumed unsophisticated persona just sort of underlined how long ago Halston lived, and how long ago he died. It seems like ancient history, and yet what I came away with was how perfectly beautiful and timeless those original clothes were, they could stand up to any era or esthetic measuring device and still be absolutely graceful, and I'm so glad I watched this movie because more than anything else it communicated that fact.",1356393600,,1433,4.575875486381323

5013954,1,B006QVRV1I,"I found great reproach within the 89 minutes of this documentary. Generally there was fault with the way the information was presented, with almost no research on the subject, the interviews seem haphazardly put together, and the narrator/director is awkward. Clearly this work was conducted by a fledgling who lacks artistic ability or in the least organizational abilities. It is presented in such a blas manner as if the director was indifferent to the outcome of the footage. If done correctly the film would have been praised a complete gesamtkunstwerk in documentary cinema.

The film is basically a collection of unorganized and poorly researched interviews. Even some of the people he interviews point this out to him!  Whitney Sudler-Smith sits there staring in a bewildered stupor as he interviews people occasionally asking random superficial questions expecting the interviewee to magically tell him everything he wants to know. He seems awkward and influenced by whatever people say with no resolute position on Halston or the aim of the film. The best part of this film is that we are taken into Halston's 63st home in NYC for a small segment.

It is greatly unfortunate that an admirable subject was presented in such a lackadaisical manner in which it produced a campy film that could have been covered deeply with concrete questions and substance and less tangential reportage.

However apart from these criticisms the value of the film is that it outlines Roy Halston's contributions to the global perspective of American fashion. Providing the viewer at least with an incredulous, yet still maintaining a archaic vision of fashion in the 70's and Halston's substantial role in producing simple elegant American style.

Although the delivery and mise-en-scne of the film is presented very poorly, one must judge it based on the facts that are presented to us. In a whole it is a step forward as a commemoration for a great American man who followed his dreams: Roy Halston Frowick.",1343520000,7,1999,5.10091743119266
5013955,4,B006QVRV1I,"I watched this on demand on Amazon and then purchased it because I love anything about fashion design and designers.

This is a thought-provoking and very interesting film about Halston and the 70s when he was the king of couture.  I learned
so much about him and fell in love with his clothes.

I actually worked around the corner from his shop on Madison Avenue when I was a young woman, but could not afford his
gorgeous Ultrasuede outfits.

  You will learn about his fabrics and how he cut and designed everything so carefully.  He was a
man of many virtues like hard working and fastidious and of course a veritable genius.  You will also learn about the wilder
side of life that was happening back then at Studio 54.  Lots of famous models and stars in this movie.  Also a look inside
his beautiful home in Manhattan.

Highly recommend if you are a fashion afficianado.",1342396800,2,876,4.551282051282051
5013956,1,B006QVRV1I,"""Ultrasuede:  In Search of Halston"" is Ultrabad.

Director Whitney Sudler-Smith has created an unfocused, uninformed, and uninspired film purportedly about Halston.  However, it becomes very obvious, after only the first 15 minutes, that the ""director,"" has not a clue about (nor a desire to understand) the man who, from his early days as a milliner at Bergdorf Goodman to his position as an uber designer and arbiter of timeless fashion, is responsible for bringing beauty, elegance, and grace to America, not to mention the rest of the world.

Mr. Sudler-Smith is not only a bad ""director"" but he is unprofessional and a terrible reporter.  He constantly interrupts his interviewees when they are answering his ill-founded questions.  He unsuccessfully attempts to change the focus from Halston to Diana Vreeland during one interview.  His ""Dixie"" playing cellphone interrupts the flow of another interview.  Not to mention, throughout the documentary, his outlandish makeup, hair, and wardrobe changes become more distracting and unappealing with each passing scene.

Apparently, Liza Minnelli's early suggestion to ""do some research"" fell on Mr. Sudler-Smith's deaf ears.

All of this begs the question, ""when will we receive an informative, intelligent, and quality-made documentary deserving of Halston's magnificently sublime creations?""

Not recommended.",1340668800,9,1363,5.698019801980198

8503273,2,B006QVRV1I,I had high hopes for this film. I'm fascinated by Halston and wanted to know more about him and his empire. What I got was an awkward documentary with way too much of the filmmaker/narrator Whitney Sudler Smith. Self indulgent much? I could have done without all of the scenes with him driving around Manhattan in his 70s muscle car and countless other bits of WSS strewn about the film. Even Liza felt the vibes as his interview with her was awkward and disjointed. I gave  this film 2 stars because I did learn some facts and felt I knew new more about Halston after watching it but I could have saved myself time by simply reading his Wikipedia page.,1473465600,,653,4.441666666666666
