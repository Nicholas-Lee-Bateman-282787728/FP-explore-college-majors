3497845,5,B001BRZ5II,I live overseas and teach an American cultural education course for children who are US citizens. I always had the Schoolhouse Rock songs in my head as I was growing up. The songs are descriptive and catchy.  The Election Collection has songs about American History in addition to election songs.  It made those of us running the class nostalgic.  It's a wonderful collection.,1234137600,,376,4.936507936507937
3497846,4,B001BRZ5II,"I use it in my 2nd grade class.  The students LOVE it, and they understand it.  Too bad they don't make them any more.",1226361600,2,118,3.875
3497847,4,B001BRZ5II,"how many of you remember sitting on the couch waiting for schoolhouse rock to come om?  Admit is, you still know the workd to I'm just a bill, and conjunction junction!!  this is so cool to watch and to make a part of your child's memory",1226361600,,237,4.130434782608695
3497848,4,B001BRZ5II,"I watched this DVD because I am absolutely obsessed with Schoolhouse Rock, and politics, so it only seemed fair to give it a shot.
It gives some of the great classics, such as ""I'm just a bill"" and the ""I'm gonna send your vote to college""
The graphics are restored, and the sound is as well, so it looks and sounds great.

The only thing I was disappointed in was the 2 ""surprise"" endings. They weren't amazing. Like 20 seconds, and nothing too spectacular.

Of course the DVD comes with a few things, like an election tracking kit, which, seeing how the election isn't until Tuesday, I haven't used yet. Looks cool though. Lots of stickers. =]

Overall, worth the money. Especially since it includes the classics.",1225324800,2,715,4.6141732283464565
3497849,5,B001BRZ5II,"I grew up with School House Rock - I memorized the preamble to the constitution by singing ""We The People"" so I decided that this was perfect to share with my middle school students.  I've used the ""election"" series to introduce American history and civics.  Now they hum these infectious songs while working on assignments.  We start the section on congress in the next few weeks so I expect I will be hearing the students singing about ""Bill"" until winter break.  These videos have made, what some students may view as a dry subject matter, interesting and engaging.  Never underestimate the power of the cartoon.",1225324800,,615,4.819047619047619
3497850,5,B001BRZ5II,"""Schoolhouse Rock"" was a great learning tool for my children when it was on TV during the 70's.  Now my children have children of their own, and I was happy to share this latest Election Collection DVD with my three grandsons.  The tunes are catchy, the video is fun, and the educational benefit is huge (and painless).  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get rid of a lot of the political ads on TV and replace them with segments from this DVD!  Then we'd all learn something and enjoy doing it.",1224806400,,498,4.380434782608695
3497851,4,B001BRZ5II,"I should have a sucker tattoo on my forehead.  Schoolhouse rock completionists should buy this DVD.  Otherwise, stay away.  The menus are cute, and arranged strangely.  Some of these segments fit nicely, but some don't at all.  If, however, you're interested in a new perspective on an old set - you're not getting much here.  I'm a little upset about the price - under $10 could've pushed this further, but I did but all of the VHS sets around $10.  I figured that I was already in this thing above $50 anyways, so another $15...

The new song is cute, and clocks in at about 60 seconds.  It does fit nicely in with all of the other pieces of the pie.  (Know how busy prepositions, the money segments, and even Mr. Morton kinda don't quite fit?)  This harkens back to that late 70's feel...

As for the surprise ending?  I don't wanna spoil it, but they're NEARLY identical.

Worth it for the completionist, not so much for anyone else...",1222992000,3,939,4.479289940828402
3497852,4,B001BRZ5II,"Ok, I realize Im an Idiot for buying this, because I have the other 2 disk set with all the SHR episodes, but I decided to get it to get the new song, So yeah, Im a gullable Idiot, Ok, but I love School House Rock, so....",1222732800,2,221,3.723404255319149
3497853,3,B001BRZ5II,"Just get the 30th Anniversary Edition of Schoolhouse Rock instead of this one. This ""Election Collection"" only sports 14 songs from the 40+ classics that were made back in the day of educating children through Saturday morning cartoon shorts. The songs they do pick are of course themed for electoral stuff so you definitely will get classics like ""I'm Just a Bill"" as well as government/patriotic related stuff like ""Shot Heard Around the World."" While you do get a brand-new exclusive song, ""Presidential Minute"", you are shortchanging yourself considering the 30th Anniversary Edition is only a few dollars more and give you almost four times the content.

Another interesting snippet in the Election Collection includes an election tracking kit so your little ones can follow the upcoming election using stickers and stuff. So if you really want your kid to get into the election process I suppose that may make it worth it. Also the DVD has an english 5.1 dolby track and a spanish track (no info on if it's stereo, mono or what). In the end I have to say just get the 30th Anniversary Edition and give your kids and yourself a much bigger bang for the buck.",1218067200,104,1163,4.786069651741293

3497858,2,B001BRZ5II,"While we love the songs, the poor rating is due to the fact that we have ordered this disc twice as it is advertised to come with a chart and stickers to tract the presidential election.

8284327,5,B001BRZ5II,"Earth Rock is even more so a great addition to the series set. Because most of the songs are repeats from the series set, but it DOES have exclusive bonuses; the short song Presidential Minute is now easier to access, and has 2 different endings! It also has an election kit, which can now be kept as a souvenir from any election year, since it was Russians that hacked the 2016 election so Donald Trump could win, and as bad as he is, he's happy about it, and still wants voter fraud for Hillary Clinton's votes ""fixed"", the big turkey! You wanna help make America great again? Why not learn what the president's supposed to know with SchoolHouse Rock's Election Collection DVD? And also to help impeach Trump for all he's done or will do! While Trump's a big turkey, this renowned short series is never a turkey, regardless of age, race, gender, or religion!
