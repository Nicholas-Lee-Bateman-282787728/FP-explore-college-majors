3133328,5,B0014IC320,"I am writing this review before the DVD release date as I was able to see this program broadcast on PBS a couple of weeks ago.  I really loved it! I grew up listening to the original Company cast recording so I was very familiar with the music but have never actually seen this show on stage. I was so sorry to miss this revival on Broadway and was thrilled to find out it was scheduled to be released on DVD.

The staging of this show is so clever; simplistic but extremely effective! The cast are not only acting their parts but playing their own instruments. Raul Esparza is a pleasure to watch as Bobby, the single man trying to figure out his own life by observing his crazy married friends. If you love Broadway, musicals and/or Sondheim you will probably love this production. I am planning on buying this as soon as it is released!",1205452800,11,839,4.371794871794871
3133329,5,B0014IC320,I love this show. Huge Sondheim fan and really enjoy the staging with the actors playing the instruments themselves.,1456876800,,116,5.157894736842105

3133332,4,B0014IC320,"Raul Esparza, better known today for his dramatic TV roles, does a good job here leading the cast of one of the more contrived Broadway productions of recent years. In John Doyle's staging, the actors are also the orchestra, carrying their instruments around the stage as they sing and act their parts. It's not that novel a gimmick (Doyle himself used it previously in a London production of another play) and it doesn't really add anything. If anything, it detracts from the narrative flow, and draws attention to itself, as it does in the staging of ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" where saxophones stand in for some of the vocalisms of the singers. I found myself constantly thinking about the depth of talent in New York that makes it possible to cast such a show rather than the show itself.

Still, after a few acts you learn to ignore the staging until it's thrown back in your face, and you can appreciate the fine acting and singing in this production. Barbara Walsh's Joanne is a bit too much a copy of Elaine Stritch in her version of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" but I suppose that's the curse of that role, Stritch having pretty much defined it for anyone who follows. Overall it's a solid B+/A- show, and I have to admit I find myself watching it again every time PBS reruns it.",1450396800,3,1289,4.532188841201717

3133353,5,B0014IC320,"Company is my favorite musical of all time.  It's centered around Robert (or Bobby, depending on who is addressing him), a bachelor in his mid-30s, and his thoughts on relationships as he watches his friends pair up and split apart, as well as the relationships that come and go from his own life.  He's ambivalent about relationships and is a bit of a playboy, but as he celebrates another birthday he feels the pull for something more than just casual sex and replaceable girlfriends.  He wants some company.

Raul Esparza does a great job as the charming and loveable cad Bobby; even as you see him making poor decisions and treating his relationships as disposable commodities, you can also see his longing for connection and companionship.  Esparza sets the bar high for the performances in the show, and all of the cast rises to deliver.  One of the best known songs from the show is ""Ladies Who Lunch,"" and while I mean no disrespect to the late, great Elaine Stritch, Barbara Walsh's rendition of the song in this production is breath-taking!  It starts out with the character Joanne's smug superiority as a woman of privilege, but as the song progresses cracks begin to show in her perfect faade.  By the end of the song, you see a woman stripped of her pretense, belting out her emptiness and longing.  And just like that, the wall goes back up.  The performance is unforgettable.

I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys Sondheim's quirky, insightful shows, especially those who like to think about the meaning of relationships in our lives, why people choose to get married (or not), and whether company is the same thing as connection.",1425513600,2,1651,4.778169014084507

3133357,5,B0014IC320,"This is an excellent TV version of the 2007 Broadway revival of the 1970 George Furth/Stephen Soldheim musical. I saw it on stage, and I'm glad they recorded it for posterity. A sensitive bachelor in NYC (Raul Esparza) looks at the marriages of his closest friends and wonders if it's time for him to find someone and settle down. Alternately funny and dramatic, this sparkling show has one of Sondheim's best scores, including ""Sorry/Grateful,"" ""Another Hundred People,"" ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" and the stunning ""Being Alive."" If you've never seen COMPANY, this is a terrific introduction to a great Broadway gem. Highly Recommended.",1423008000,5,634,5.165048543689321

The cast in fantastic and the idea of the musicians mainly consisting of the cast highlighted some different parts of the text that I wasn't familiar with before. It may be a little heavy and more on the mature side, but if you can handle that, I would recommend watching it!",1404000000,3,364,4.615384615384615

I had to buy it again because my library feels incomplete without it.  It's quirky, it catches you off-guard, it's a bit slow in some places, but I definitely prefer this version to the newer NPH release.

3133381,5,B0014IC320,One of Sondheim's best!  I was absolutely blown away to hear the wonderful songs from this show.  What was even more amazing was to watch and hear each actor in the show play their own instrument.  I watch this show at least once every two months and love it all over again.,1385942400,,274,4.230769230769231
3133382,5,B0014IC320,"After seeing the recent PBS Lincoln Center performance, I wanted to see this iteration. This  musical succeeds in all sorts of ways. Sondheim's gorgeous songs are performed ravishingly here. (I much prefered it to the Lincoln Center's earnest but ""unpolished"" singinging.) I was also more than pleasantly surprised just how well the story holds up. To me, it summarizes and plays with 60's themes of social conflicts and changes beautifully and ridiculously intelligently. But it does not remain a period piece. The characters are perfectly developed, and so engaging. Big universal themes about finding one's place among others and within themselves just shout out clearly here. The fears, pitfalls and richness  of giving yourself to someone else are told almost perfectly in this version of Company.
My only uncertainty is with the actors playing instruments. Is this just a clever random gesture?? I suspect that I would appreciate or understand this better sitting in the theater instead of watching on the laptop with headphones in the ears. Still, this a stunning and convincing performance",1385769600,,1097,5.2988505747126435

As engaging as it truly is; very aside, soliloquy, or cathartic, I did not realize the overt subtle sexual over tones it contains, or its impudent substance. While I certainly an no prude, this definitely is more PG-13 than I realized. It totally breathed human sexuality, married or single, from opening to end.

3133394,4,B0014IC320,"The 2007 revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical Company, and likely the original as well, is a show peppered with painful truths and emotional heartbreak, but filled mostly with caricature. The serious subject matter is unfortunately often reduced to cartoonish images of marriage, which bog down the true heart and ambition of this musical.

Company explores the lives of white upper-middle class New Yorkers and their relationship problems. The dialogue is typically blunt and up-front about this subject matter, which already sets the tone for an unrealistically ambitious musical; either Sondheim or book writer George Furth must view married people as constantly discussing their marriage, and how their lives are different relative to single people. This creates a very interesting commentary on contemporary romance, but also subverts who should be very real, three-dimensional people, into individuals who speak of themselves in the broad, sweeping strokes of marital status and love in the urban world.

The excellent score, with witty lyrics and uncharacteristically catchy music (by Sondheim's standards), is broken down by clunky, unrealistic dialogue by Furth. There is a particular sequence towards the beginning, in which a playful ditty is broken up by a facepalm-worthy series of karate moves by one of the couples. The audience in the PBS recording of Company was roaring with laughter, so at least somebody liked it.

Granted, this is a show about unhappy New Yorkers meant for an audience of middle-class, likely married, and probably cynical New Yorkers. Maybe I'm just the wrong demo for a musical like this, but even as a young man I recognize there is more to marriage than the caricature it is reduced to throughout most of the show.

About halfway through, however, Company takes a sudden turn for the mature, with fantastic introspective songs such as ""Marry Me a Little,"" revealing the protagonist Bobby's inability both to commit and to find someone that would even have him. This, in my opinion, is the real heart of this show, of striking the balance between wanting independence and just finding somebody who's willing to have you. This sense of loneliness is what really hits home, for me at least, certainly more so than the bickering and unrelatable couples we deal with for most of the show.

And maybe that's the point. Maybe Bobby starts out seeing his married friends as these cartoonish buffoons and he matures and sees that there is more to marriage than this ridiculous display (though that would be weirdly postmodern?). By the end of the show, Bobby and the quality of the script have both matured, hitting this emotionally tragic theme much stronger, such as in the excellent finale ""Being Alive.""

My disappointment in Company is mostly from the fact that the show does hit these wonderful strong notes, and I wish this strength pervaded throughout the entire musical. It is certainly a very good play, but it only grazes the greatness that it could and should have achieved.",1369440000,,3022,5.119675456389452

The depictions of the various realities of marriage & relationships demonstrate the genius of Sondheim. The comedy serves to bring the points home in a pretty impactful way.

3133412,5,B0014IC320,"Lonny Price's ""Company,"" based on the 2007 Broadway production by John Doyle, is one of the greatest film versions I have ever seen of a staged musical. At the outset, I must say I was too young to see the original Harold Prince production with Dean Jones and Elaine Stritch, so I cannot compare the two. Doyle gave ""Company"" the same treatment he gave ""Sweeney Todd"" a couple of years before, with a bare stage and the performers playing musical instruments as well as acting and singing. Doyle's ""Sweeney Todd"" just didn't work for me; the bare stage and musical instruments distanced me from the story, which really needs to sweep the audience up in its bloody embrace. But ""Company,"" with its anecdotal structure and extreme dependence on the songs to put the story across, fits perfectly with Doyle's method. At its best this DVD reaches a white-hot intensity, its musical numbers uniquely mesmerizing and haunting.

The songs in ""Company"" are among the greatest Stephen Sondheim ever wrote, and this production has first-rate singer-actors to put them across. Any discussion of the singing and acting has to begin and end with Raul Esparza, who is galvanizing in the main role of Bobby. Handsome and charismatic but in a slightly bedraggled way, Esparza is perfect as a man drifting passively through life, seeking connection and yet terrified of it. Esparza's singing in such classic numbers as ""Marry Me a Little"" and ""Being Alive"" is nothing short of glorious. Of course, great performances don't exist in a vacuum, and the other performers in ""Company"" are a match for Esparza, paticularly the women. I will always cherish the memory of Heather Laws' hilarious confusion in ""Getting Married Today,"" a brilliant update on the patter songs of Gilbert & Sullivan; of Barbara Walsh belting ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" as if she were trying to short out the cameras; of Angel Desai's superb version of ""Another Hundred People;"" of Desai, Kelly Jeanne Grant and Elizabeth Stanley tearing up the stage (and their saxophones) in ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy;"" of Stanley and Esparza's tender-acerbic ""Barcelona;"" and so on, and so on.

The bonus section of this DVD includes fascinating interviews with Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle, making this version of ""Company"" a real bargain and a real treat for anyone who loves the musical theatre.",1316131200,,2338,4.992307692307692
3133413,4,B0014IC320,I really found this an enjoyable show. I think it is great to see live productions filmed rather than made into movies. This is how this is meant to be. THis production is good each of the little vignettes being well acted well sung and performers despite or perhaps because this show has no real narrative the characters and situations are explored well with Sondheim's score being the real str. For me it's his best show when well done which it is here. Terrific.,1315785600,,465,4.5476190476190474
3133414,5,B0014IC320,"This exact production of Company was my first Broadway show, and I went in having no idea what to expect.  I thought it was pretty incredible the first time around!  This is one of the Sondheim comedies that I believe is so well-written that it rivals how great Sweeney Todd is as a horror show.  While it might not be absolutely ""timeless"" it is very entertaining with some unforgettable musical moments.

For people who are familiar with Company already, it may be worth it to watch promotional material for this production because the ""feel"" of the show is different from back in the sixties/seventies when the original came out.  Barbara Walsh sings a fantastic drunk Ladies Who Lunch in a much more classy style than Elaine Stritch did, and Raul Esparza is almost not even singing in this production.  The few very musical moments he gets, however, are incredible, and since his voice can go so much higher than this role requires all the notes he sings are very sure and strong.  The almost-camp-by-now-but-still-really-cool gimmick of having the actors play all the instruments does not distract here, so for people concerned about whether or not they were able to pull it off, the answer is yes.

All in all the talent onstage is so tremendous that it even comes through on DVD, and it still feels alive and fresh.  This production is very much worth seeing!",1311033600,,1366,4.754237288135593

And I've listened to the cast album for years. These songs are old friends of mine. I agree with another reviewer--this production was an abomination. I really tried to like it as simply a different interpretation. But really, having the actors play the instruments (instead of a full orchestra) and march around the stage was annoying and stupid. Raul Esperanza was a smarmy Bobbie instead of charming, and his singing was annoying to listen to. The only bright spot in this production was the actress playing  Joanne (Elaine Stritch's role). Don't waste your time on this production. Instead, if you get a chance, see the Philharmonic production with Neil Patrick Harris as Bobbie--probably the best portrayal I've seen. It was recorded and recently shown at select movie theaters around the county and I was lucky enough to see it. I hope they put that on DVD--I'll buy it in a nano-second!",1308960000,13,1049,4.9602272727272725
3133416,4,B0014IC320,"I love Sondheim, and I cannot imagine not viewing anything I can get my hands on. I liked the new Company. I'd heard a story on NPR explaining that all of the actors would carry and play instruments in lieu of an orchestra. Often, It was too much, and it felt like a way to cut costs rather than be creative. It greatly slowed down ""you can drive a person crazy"", as those poor women were expected to play and sing the difficult, fast song. However, it made ""Sorry-Grateful"" very intimate and touching.

Finally, I'm not sure about Bobby. Well, I'm pretty sure I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was Raul Esparza who played Bobby, or John Doyle who directed Bobby. Either way, Bobby was this soul searching, intense, kinda downer guy through the whole musical. At the beginning, he is suppose to take his friends kids to the zoo, the women to the Opera (and like it), he sleeps around without apologizes, and he knows where to score if you want a bit of something-something for a party. In other words, Bobby was supposed to be the life of the party until his epiphany that he wanted to grow up and get married, have a family. Since he was already intense, there was no where to go.

Still, watch it, especially it you haven't seen it before. It isn't done often, and it might a long time before you get a chance to see it live.",1303603200,2,1332,4.3453815261044175

I think the absence of subtitles is particularly important here, because the singers' diction, while very good, is not as absolutely clear as it might be, or as it is on the original cast recording of COMPANY. And of course Sondheim's lyrics are tricky enough that at some point almost everyone is going to need subtitles to follow them.

Another reviewer has already mentioned a certain overintensity in the lead performer. I didn't notice that, but the singer who does ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" is overintense indeed. This is her decision, and the song is so famous for its mordancy that I can hardly blame her for overplaying its bitterness, but I think a touch of humor would have made the song better, and that finally it collapses under the extreme self-importance she imparts to it.

If the other critic and I are both right, this entire production suffers a little from its exaggerated seriousness.",1253318400,,955,4.775757575757575

Any Broadway lover will delight in this version. The performances are first class. The musical numbers unique and delightful. The direction is well paced and methodical. If you missed it on Broadway (I didn't), you can enjoy it now in this stellar production. I find myself enjoying COMPANY more than I did in New York.

The original production explored this issue with a fair amount of restraint, but this new production got so raw, you tend to forget that they're actors onstage.

I think that's what's interesting about the way this was done; beyond the actor/musician thing, and the multiple vantage points, everything seemed to be so REAL.

Let me be clear, it is not the production itself but the source material I did not enjoy.

This production is my first experience with ""Company"".  I just did not enjoy Sondheim's score or the story.  It was all pretty depressing and glum.  The point of view felt rather cynical and jaded.  I couldn't identify or recognize anything desirable in the characters or relationships.  Some of the dialogue had a very dated feel (though expected in a musical from 1970, it was not enjoyed).  It felt bound to a time and place - not one filled with wonder and excitement, but one that I am glad has been left behind.  One I have no joy in visiting.  Overall, the characters were not engaging due to their emotional detachment and the plastic veneer surrounding them.  Everything was a facade.

On the positive side, Raul Esparza is a very talented singer and actor (I loved him in the recording of Jonathan Larson's ""Tick... Tick...Boom!"").  The rest of the ensemble was also generally good.  There were several humorous moments despite the general melancholy feel.  The sparse staging and the actors doubling as instrumentalists took a bit of getting used to, but it was successful enough in the end.  I will not go so far as to say it added to the production, but it was passable.  I do wonder if such technique should be used if it does not truly enhance the material, though.  Doesn't one wish to see the best staging possible?  I am not sure this is it.

If you like ""Company"" or are a fan of Sondheim, I would highly recommend you check out this production.  The talented cast and innovative staging just couldn't overcome the material itself for me.  Certainly that is a matter of taste.",1223078400,3,1939,4.648967551622419
3133447,5,B0014IC320,"I loved Company when I saw it on Broadway, but the concept, with the actors working with musical instruments in hand during the performance, was distracting and took away from the show. But here, with the camera able focus on individual players, one at a time, it works. It works better than it did on Stage. Raul Esparza is terrific throughout, and the Sondheim score is, at turns, beautiful, funny and relevant throughout.

3133448,4,B0014IC320,"Sondheim's finest musical has finally been recorded for posterity and this production by PBS is excellent. A number of camera angles provide a brilliant capture of the performance and give a feeling that almost surpasses sitting in the Ethel Barrymore theatre itself. The sound and picture quality are spot on and the only disappointing element (causing the loss of a star) is the lack of Extras. They amount to two poorly filmed interviews with confident star Raul Esparza and director John Doyle; and the surprising inclusion of an interview conducted with Sondheim by Jonathan Biggins for Foxtel and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when he attended the opening of Kookaburra musical theatre's 2007 production of Company - which was far inferior to the main feature of this DVD and performed in the standard manner (i.e. without the actors also playing the instruments). Where are the 'backstage' extras - e.g. filming the cast in preparation in their dressing rooms, or any rehearsal footage? The path to putting this version on stage would have involved some interesting rehearsal processes to get the staging right with the inclusion of the instruments - a feature on this aspect would have been eagerly welcomed.
But never mind that, the performances captured here are magical and might I even say that this is the definitive version of Company? If it's not, it's darn close. You won't regret purchasing this title.",1222646400,,1429,5.1373390557939915

3133450,5,B0014IC320,"When I was younger I saw this show and shrugged it off as a fun but two-dimensional spoof of marital relations.  Now that I am the age of the characters and a bit more seasoned in the ways of the world, however, I see things differnetly. This show is an emotional knock-out. Company is a gentle whirlwind of humor, desperation, hurt, love and alienation, delivered through great songs and quirky performances. The production and the material are amazing, wringing out thoughts and fears that I was not even aware were simmering below the surface.

Raul Esparza has a Bob Newhart-type delivery that works well in playing Bobby, and the character is all too familiar to anyone who has been the lonely but loved buddy-brother-father confessor to an extended group of friends. The other actors are equally good.  While I don't have all of their names handy, I offer extensive applause to the women who played Amy, Marta, and JoAnn.  I also applaud Bruce Sabbath, who plays Larry with a sense of kindness and patience even though he knows he is underappreciated and mistreated by his wife.

The staging and costuming evoke an upscale, Bobby Short-type piano lounge, communicating simultaneously a sense of Upper East Side glamour and urban world worriness.  Given the setting and millieu of the show,this visual effect is brilliant.

I saw the version of Sweeney Todd that had the cast accompanying themselves on musical instruments.  In that production, the approach seemed to be a pointless gimmick.  In Company, however, the approach works.  The cast members are a ""company,"" in a musical, acting and social sense.

Watching this production will hurt a little but will also be rewarding.",1221091200,,1685,4.982142857142857

3133454,5,B0014IC320,"If you're looking for one word: genius.

If you're looking for a few more, however....

This is perhaps Stephen Sondheim's greatest work.  Arguable, but certainly a matter of opinion.  His lyrics are incomparable, and the tone of the music is conversational - perfectly suited to George Furth's casual-style book.  The emotional release in Being Alive sends a timeless message, not only in context of the show, but outside it as well.  Any composer or lyricist who can make a song apply so perfectly both inside and outside of a show is, without doubt, genius.

Now - the direction.  Everyone has their opinion on John Doyle's actors doubling as musicians.  In Sweeney I found it to be distasteful.  Instead of that, however, it simply suits this style of show.  It's all a concept show, and it all takes place in Robert's head.  Robert's singing songs about marriage in his head, why would it be inconceivable for him to imagine his friends playing instruments in accompaniment to his musings?  Not only does it make sense, it just works.  The staging could almost not be better.  The acting and singing is fantastic.  I could ask for a little more as far as instrumentals - meaning better - but I won't.

The entire show, you feel the build.  You feel this build in tension, and then you get a complete release of it all in Being Alive.  Having just watched Passion, that is something you don't get from that show.  Company is a complete release, a definite end to the story being told.  But at the same time, the story does not end.  Sondheim and Furth supply closure without closing.  This is enhanced particularly by John Doyle's cut of the finale.

Lastly, Raul Esparza.  No more words need to be said, but I'll say them anyway.  His interpretation of Bobby is sublime.  Unreal.  The motif of the entire play is the theme of the opening number, and Raul captures that chaos in his acting.  You can see that Bobby is in constant thought, and it puts you into his shoes - you start to see what he sees, in order to grasp what he might be thinking about.  The way he is able to contain his voice in ""Someone is Waiting"" is perfect.  There could not have been a better actor found, I think, to play Bobby in this revival.

Overall - near perfection on stage.  The staging of Being Alive is the embodiment of theatre.  I say it every time I watch it.  I'm more and more captivated each time.",1218672000,4,2392,4.522248243559719

Now, perhaps, Broadway will wake up to the fact that there are a vast number of us out here who can't ever hope to see an actual original performance of a show but who would be absolutely beside themselves to obtain these shows on DVD and applaud them in the confines of their own home. All it should take are a couple of cameras, a competent sound man and a professional director to transfer the show onto the digital media.

3133460,4,B0014IC320,"The expressions on Raul Esparza's face detail the rumblings beneath the surface that Stephen Sondheim finds fascinating.

This 2006 Tony-winning revival received a mixed response from audiences and critics alike. But then, COMPANY is a show that is always divisive. For starters, the show has no ""plot"" in a conventional sense. That bothers some viewers. It also uses songs to express attitudes rather than advance the story (again, what story?) But those subtle lingering looks, the unexpected responses, the sighs, the pauses...they communicate so much about these characters, and that is beautifully captured in this video.

No, it is not the COMPANY that was seen on Broadway in 1970. Given the advances it presaged, I expect that to see an archival reconstruction of the original might now look horribly dated.  Jonathan Doyle has given the show a fresh perspective by having the company of actors double as musicians. It's a stunt he tried before with SWEENEY TODD to much acclaim. Unfortunately, coming after SWEENEY critics tended to be very blaze about the whole thing. Yeah, What else can you do?

But the concept actually works better with Company and is far less distracting. You do not miss the full orchestra as much here as with the more operatic SWEENEY. It makes the story more intimate and personal. The concept has a few drawbacks. Several times numbers end by segueing back into dialogue, frustrating an audience that wants to applaud but keeping the rhythm steady.

The rock steady performance of Raul Esparza anchors the entire show. It's performance that earned him high praise - and a Tony nomination - and years from now people will talk about. But unlike Dean Jones in the original they'll be able to do more than talk about it: they can see it thanks to this DVD.",1215043200,6,1790,4.9335548172757475

Love me just enough.

So we'll both be free.
That's the way it ought to be....

Only Stephen Sondheim could come up with such sophisticated couplets to a love song as disquieting as the beautiful ""Marry Me a Little"". I was very fortunate to have seen the enthralling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-production/dp/B000LV6R4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 production</a>&nbsp;at the Ethel Barrymore Theater last season, and I'm thrilled it has been captured for posterity on DVD as part of PBS's ""Great Performances"" series. There is something supremely ironic about how a 37-year old show, already revived twice, can feel fresher than most Broadway musicals written today. However, when the music reflects Sondheim at his most accomplished with performers so adept, it becomes a moot point, even though several of the songs here have been inescapable at karaoke bars for years from the lips of overly zealous musical theater aficionados.

Staged like a minimalist cabaret act, John Doyle's joyous revival uses the same technique he used in his 2005 production of Sondheim's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd/dp/B000CRR3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd</a>, specifically he has the actors play their own musical instruments, a daring move which actually helps underline the characters' feelings. The story is blessedly simple as it revolves around perennial bachelor Bobby, as he turns 35 and observes his circle of upscale Manhattanite friends, five married couples at different stages in various vignettes that make him reconsider what he wants out of life. Juggling three girlfriends, Bobby is a likeable but elliptical figure with commitment issues, and the story really follows his journey toward self-acceptance. There is an element of contrivance to the structure, but what I thought would be a severely dated libretto by George Furth continues to resonate with wit and insight.

For a canon as legendary and often erratic as his, Sondheim's sophisticated music and lyrics never seemed as accessible and hummable as they do here. So much of the show rides on the crucial casting of Bobby, and Ral Esparza is terrifically bold and poignant in managing the precarious balance between yearning romantic and cynical hedonist. With a beautifully expressive singing voice coupled with a common-guy demeanor, he captures the character's arc with an escalating emotional intensity from the measured romanticism of ""Someone Is Waiting"" to the tender tentativeness of ""Marry Me a Little"" (with the beautiful, Sondheim-trademarked rolling piano) to the bursting climactic catharsis of ""Being Alive"".

The rest of the cast accomplish wonderful moments that already come with high expectations - Heather Laws' dexterously motors her way through ""Getting Married Today"" with her character's nerve-wracking intensity intact; Elizabeth Stanley brings a likable warmth to the dim-bulb flight attendant April as she duets sweetly with Esparza on the comically post-coital ""Barcelona""; Angel Desai's saucy turn as hip Marta on ""Another Hundred People""; the poignant ""Sorry-Grateful"" performed by the comparatively less spotlighted male ensemble; and of course, there are the lacerating observations in ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", handled with fierce worldliness by Barbara Walsh as Joanne. In the intimidating shadow of Elaine Stritch, Walsh lets out repeated primal screams at the end that pierce with wounding acuity.

TV director Lonny Price does a fluent job transferring the production to the small screen with minimum fuss. The 2008 DVD contains three terrific extras. First, there is a fifteen-minute interview with an articulate and thoughtful Esparza who discusses his connection with Bobby, the challenge of learning piano, and the alternating joy and pressure of working with Sondheim (for the third time). There is also a nine-minute interview with the erudite Doyle who explains how his unique use of actors as musicians went over with Sondheim. The centerpiece has to be a fascinating, 38-minute interview that Australian TV personality Jonathan Biggins conducted with Sondheim last year in Sydney's Theatre Royal. Sondheim is particularly forthcoming with humorous anecdotes about working with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand, and his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II during his long, illustrious career.  This is a wonderful DVD for any Broadway aficionado and particularly for fans of Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle. I happen to be all three.",1211414400,63,4666,5.7452966714905935
3133470,5,B0014IC320,"Company is one of my favorite Sondheim shows so far (the others being Sweeney Todd and Sunday in the Park with George). It's a show that requires good acting and showcases outstanding acting. The ensemble numbers are beautiful. The Original Broadway Cast recording sounds very 1970s-ish, but the revival orchestration has updated the music to sound modern and classy. The musical has three of my favorite songs: ""Being Alive,"" ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" and ""Getting Married Today."" The show is funny and witty, but it carries a strong message, too. Marriage, in fact any kind of commitment, is a compromise. It sucks that when we choose one path, we close many others, but that's what life is about. Life is about making choices. There's nothing wrong with Bobby being a bachelor. The problem is that it's all he knows. He's never tried anything else. He's never made a choice; he's always waiting to see what other people do. Joanne's stinging number ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" reminds Bobby (and the audience) that you can sit around wasting your life pretending you're actually living it. Delusion is insidious. There are so many ways to waste time, whether it's going to fittings, taking in high art like Mahler symphonies and Pinter plays, mocking other people, surfing the internet (wait, that's not in the musical...)
I loved Raul Esparza as Bobby. He played a very calm, sweet guy who gradually becomes more and more distraught about being as an outsider.  His rendition of ""Being Alive"" is amazing, beyond words.  The supporting cast is directed to be that -- ""supporting"" so if you're looking for an Elaine Strich-like ""Ladies"", get the OBC recording.  I like this choice, because it makes Bobby the focal point, as it should be.
This revival is in the controversial John Doyle actor-doubling-as-musician style.  The fact that the instruments were onstage gave the musical a cabaret feel. The cabaret feel was enhanced by the simple, black costumes and mostly bare set. Marriage and relationships are an intimate topic and the intimate setting works wonderfuly. The piano was used very effectively. I liked seeing Marta sing while sitting on top of the piano. I liked watching Bobby clumsily climb on top of the piano (emphasizing that he's still a boyish voyeur). I liked how the actor stopped playing the piano and closed the keyboard case just as Barbara Walsh was finishing ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" There were some instances where the actors-playing-instruments concept didn't work, but for the most part, I enjoyed it and the great camera direction by Lonny Price made the actor movement not too distracting.",1211328000,53,2616,4.993119266055046

The performances were quite good and Raul Esparza was completely dominating in his performance of Bobby.  I did have a few problems with some of the casting, but they were minor and the show was quite watchable.  The final number, Being Alive, was enough to make you stand and take notice.

With that being said, some of the camera-work on this is what causes it to lose a star.

I saw this production, both on Broadway (on the night it was being filmed), and again when it appeared on PBS.  It is worth seeing and hearing if you do not know the original, but for all its cleverness, it misses the core of the show,  and also misses some of the most important parts of the original.

To save money, this production cuts out the orchestra, and the actors play the instruments.  They aren't bad players, but not up to a Broadway standard.  They do have a few good spots.  But all the terrific original orchestrations are gone, gone gone, and they were particularly strong arrangements.  The most dramatic example is the evisceration of the whole bedroom scene before the song ""Barcelona."" The big section removed was both a brilliant piece of orchestration, but an important set up to the song and, especially, insight into the character of Bobby.

Other songs that suffer are ""Another 100 People Just Got Off of the Bus"" and ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" songs that really kick into another level with a big, capable orchestra.  In this show all you get is accompaniment.  I'll never forget the great dance orchestrations the late, great Wally Harper did for the original show, and it makes me sad to see all this flash gone.

The other thing wrong with this show is how Bobby is played, or imagined.  Raul Esparza does have a sort of flash himself, and the audience obviously likes him, and many may have come to see him, but he just doesn't get Bobby, or he just cannot do the ambiguous or warmer sides of Bobby's character.

Raul Esparza plays Bobby like a pure cynic, and Bobby is not a pure cynic.  Yes, he may do things that are cynical, but in many ways he needs to be the least cynical of all the characters in this show.  He weighs and grows and evolves and devolves before our eyes, but he just doesn't sit back and poke at all around him the way Bobby does here.

This show needs a fresher performance than the one Esparza gives.

Despite all these real problems, I was still happy to see the show, even to see the same production again on TV.  Most of the cast is strong.  The performance of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" was so strong the audience could not even clap at the end, they were so into it, and she nailed it so.

His conceit of having the cast play their own instruments (there is no orchestra) is cheesy and distracting. Instead of honest acting and straightforward storytelling, Doyle gives us pseudo-symbolism, actors talking into the air instead of to each other and staging that is so obtuse that anyone not already intimately familiar with COMPANY will be utterly baffled. Doyle's COMPANY is not the brilliant musical play the authors wrote; it is more like an acting class exercise. The poor cast (most of them very talented) ought to have mutinied; they probably could have directed themselves far better than this charlatan. Save your money and buy the original 1970 Broadway cast CD instead. And let us hope that one day there will be a commercial video release of a REAL production of COMPANY.",1207785600,21,895,5.179310344827586
3133476,5,B0014IC320,"Unfortunately, I was not able to see the live production in New York, but I can only imagine how amazing it must have been just watching the recording. Raul Esparza (yes, the one deserving the Tony) has the amazing gift of being able to stand absolutely still, and still draw you in sheerly by the emotion and power in his voice. The entire cast performed extraordinarily; when you're not marveling at their singing performances, you're marveling at how in the world someone can walk around, play an instrument (or in some cases, several instruments) and still manage to sing at the same time. Although this format (having actors playing instruments with minimal staging/set) probably won't work for many musicals, I found it very well done/used in this production. Altogether, thoroughly awesome :)",1206835200,6,799,5.0606060606060606
3133477,5,B0014IC320,"Aside from seeing the production live on stage (I agree with other reviewers, Raul should have won the Tony for this performance), I've seen this video production.  Not only on PBS, where the quality was so-so, but a copy of this disc.  It's not out yet officially, but it's out already.  The quality of the picture is far superior to that shown on television, and the production itself is very exciting and innovative.  This is definitely one show you'd want to add to your collection.",1206144000,11,486,4.682352941176471

The cast is strong, especially Barbara Walsh and Keith Buterbaugh.

3367825,5,B0014IC320,"I am writing this review before the DVD release date as I was able to see this program broadcast on PBS a couple of weeks ago.  I really loved it! I grew up listening to the original Company cast recording so I was very familiar with the music but have never actually seen this show on stage. I was so sorry to miss this revival on Broadway and was thrilled to find out it was scheduled to be released on DVD.

The staging of this show is so clever; simplistic but extremely effective! The cast are not only acting their parts but playing their own instruments. Raul Esparza is a pleasure to watch as Bobby, the single man trying to figure out his own life by observing his crazy married friends. If you love Broadway, musicals and/or Sondheim you will probably love this production. I am planning on buying this as soon as it is released!",1205452800,11,839,4.371794871794871

3367829,4,B0014IC320,"Raul Esparza, better known today for his dramatic TV roles, does a good job here leading the cast of one of the more contrived Broadway productions of recent years. In John Doyle's staging, the actors are also the orchestra, carrying their instruments around the stage as they sing and act their parts. It's not that novel a gimmick (Doyle himself used it previously in a London production of another play) and it doesn't really add anything. If anything, it detracts from the narrative flow, and draws attention to itself, as it does in the staging of ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" where saxophones stand in for some of the vocalisms of the singers. I found myself constantly thinking about the depth of talent in New York that makes it possible to cast such a show rather than the show itself.

Still, after a few acts you learn to ignore the staging until it's thrown back in your face, and you can appreciate the fine acting and singing in this production. Barbara Walsh's Joanne is a bit too much a copy of Elaine Stritch in her version of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" but I suppose that's the curse of that role, Stritch having pretty much defined it for anyone who follows. Overall it's a solid B+/A- show, and I have to admit I find myself watching it again every time PBS reruns it.",1450396800,3,1289,4.532188841201717

3367850,5,B0014IC320,"Company is my favorite musical of all time.  It's centered around Robert (or Bobby, depending on who is addressing him), a bachelor in his mid-30s, and his thoughts on relationships as he watches his friends pair up and split apart, as well as the relationships that come and go from his own life.  He's ambivalent about relationships and is a bit of a playboy, but as he celebrates another birthday he feels the pull for something more than just casual sex and replaceable girlfriends.  He wants some company.

Raul Esparza does a great job as the charming and loveable cad Bobby; even as you see him making poor decisions and treating his relationships as disposable commodities, you can also see his longing for connection and companionship.  Esparza sets the bar high for the performances in the show, and all of the cast rises to deliver.  One of the best known songs from the show is ""Ladies Who Lunch,"" and while I mean no disrespect to the late, great Elaine Stritch, Barbara Walsh's rendition of the song in this production is breath-taking!  It starts out with the character Joanne's smug superiority as a woman of privilege, but as the song progresses cracks begin to show in her perfect faade.  By the end of the song, you see a woman stripped of her pretense, belting out her emptiness and longing.  And just like that, the wall goes back up.  The performance is unforgettable.

I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys Sondheim's quirky, insightful shows, especially those who like to think about the meaning of relationships in our lives, why people choose to get married (or not), and whether company is the same thing as connection.",1425513600,2,1651,4.778169014084507

Sondheim's gorgeous songs are performed ravishingly here. (I much prefered it to the Lincoln Center's earnest but ""unpolished"" singinging.) I was also more than pleasantly surprised just how well the story holds up. To me, it summarizes and plays with 60's themes of social conflicts and changes beautifully and ridiculously intelligently. But it does not remain a period piece. The characters are perfectly developed, and so engaging. Big universal themes about finding one's place among others and within themselves just shout out clearly here. The fears, pitfalls and richness  of giving yourself to someone else are told almost perfectly in this version of Company.
My only uncertainty is with the actors playing instruments. Is this just a clever random gesture??

3367891,4,B0014IC320,"The 2007 revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical Company, and likely the original as well, is a show peppered with painful truths and emotional heartbreak, but filled mostly with caricature. The serious subject matter is unfortunately often reduced to cartoonish images of marriage, which bog down the true heart and ambition of this musical.

Company explores the lives of white upper-middle class New Yorkers and their relationship problems. The dialogue is typically blunt and up-front about this subject matter, which already sets the tone for an unrealistically ambitious musical; either Sondheim or book writer George Furth must view married people as constantly discussing their marriage, and how their lives are different relative to single people. This creates a very interesting commentary on contemporary romance, but also subverts who should be very real, three-dimensional people, into individuals who speak of themselves in the broad, sweeping strokes of marital status and love in the urban world.

The excellent score, with witty lyrics and uncharacteristically catchy music (by Sondheim's standards), is broken down by clunky, unrealistic dialogue by Furth. There is a particular sequence towards the beginning, in which a playful ditty is broken up by a facepalm-worthy series of karate moves by one of the couples. The audience in the PBS recording of Company was roaring with laughter, so at least somebody liked it.

Granted, this is a show about unhappy New Yorkers meant for an audience of middle-class, likely married, and probably cynical New Yorkers. Maybe I'm just the wrong demo for a musical like this, but even as a young man I recognize there is more to marriage than the caricature it is reduced to throughout most of the show.

About halfway through, however, Company takes a sudden turn for the mature, with fantastic introspective songs such as ""Marry Me a Little,"" revealing the protagonist Bobby's inability both to commit and to find someone that would even have him. This, in my opinion, is the real heart of this show, of striking the balance between wanting independence and just finding somebody who's willing to have you. This sense of loneliness is what really hits home, for me at least, certainly more so than the bickering and unrelatable couples we deal with for most of the show.

And maybe that's the point. Maybe Bobby starts out seeing his married friends as these cartoonish buffoons and he matures and sees that there is more to marriage than this ridiculous display (though that would be weirdly postmodern?). By the end of the show, Bobby and the quality of the script have both matured, hitting this emotionally tragic theme much stronger, such as in the excellent finale ""Being Alive.""

My disappointment in Company is mostly from the fact that the show does hit these wonderful strong notes, and I wish this strength pervaded throughout the entire musical. It is certainly a very good play, but it only grazes the greatness that it could and should have achieved.",1369440000,,3022,5.119675456389452

The depictions of the various realities of marriage & relationships demonstrate the genius of Sondheim. The comedy serves to bring the points home in a pretty impactful way.

3367909,5,B0014IC320,"Lonny Price's ""Company,"" based on the 2007 Broadway production by John Doyle, is one of the greatest film versions I have ever seen of a staged musical. At the outset, I must say I was too young to see the original Harold Prince production with Dean Jones and Elaine Stritch, so I cannot compare the two. Doyle gave ""Company"" the same treatment he gave ""Sweeney Todd"" a couple of years before, with a bare stage and the performers playing musical instruments as well as acting and singing. Doyle's ""Sweeney Todd"" just didn't work for me; the bare stage and musical instruments distanced me from the story, which really needs to sweep the audience up in its bloody embrace. But ""Company,"" with its anecdotal structure and extreme dependence on the songs to put the story across, fits perfectly with Doyle's method. At its best this DVD reaches a white-hot intensity, its musical numbers uniquely mesmerizing and haunting.

The songs in ""Company"" are among the greatest Stephen Sondheim ever wrote, and this production has first-rate singer-actors to put them across. Any discussion of the singing and acting has to begin and end with Raul Esparza, who is galvanizing in the main role of Bobby. Handsome and charismatic but in a slightly bedraggled way, Esparza is perfect as a man drifting passively through life, seeking connection and yet terrified of it. Esparza's singing in such classic numbers as ""Marry Me a Little"" and ""Being Alive"" is nothing short of glorious. Of course, great performances don't exist in a vacuum, and the other performers in ""Company"" are a match for Esparza, paticularly the women. I will always cherish the memory of Heather Laws' hilarious confusion in ""Getting Married Today,"" a brilliant update on the patter songs of Gilbert & Sullivan; of Barbara Walsh belting ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" as if she were trying to short out the cameras; of Angel Desai's superb version of ""Another Hundred People;"" of Desai, Kelly Jeanne Grant and Elizabeth Stanley tearing up the stage (and their saxophones) in ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy;"" of Stanley and Esparza's tender-acerbic ""Barcelona;"" and so on, and so on.

The bonus section of this DVD includes fascinating interviews with Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle, making this version of ""Company"" a real bargain and a real treat for anyone who loves the musical theatre.",1316131200,,2338,4.992307692307692
3367910,4,B0014IC320,I really found this an enjoyable show. I think it is great to see live productions filmed rather than made into movies. This is how this is meant to be. THis production is good each of the little vignettes being well acted well sung and performers despite or perhaps because this show has no real narrative the characters and situations are explored well with Sondheim's score being the real str. For me it's his best show when well done which it is here. Terrific.,1315785600,,465,4.5476190476190474
3367911,5,B0014IC320,"This exact production of Company was my first Broadway show, and I went in having no idea what to expect.  I thought it was pretty incredible the first time around!  This is one of the Sondheim comedies that I believe is so well-written that it rivals how great Sweeney Todd is as a horror show.  While it might not be absolutely ""timeless"" it is very entertaining with some unforgettable musical moments.

For people who are familiar with Company already, it may be worth it to watch promotional material for this production because the ""feel"" of the show is different from back in the sixties/seventies when the original came out.  Barbara Walsh sings a fantastic drunk Ladies Who Lunch in a much more classy style than Elaine Stritch did, and Raul Esparza is almost not even singing in this production.  The few very musical moments he gets, however, are incredible, and since his voice can go so much higher than this role requires all the notes he sings are very sure and strong.  The almost-camp-by-now-but-still-really-cool gimmick of having the actors play all the instruments does not distract here, so for people concerned about whether or not they were able to pull it off, the answer is yes.

All in all the talent onstage is so tremendous that it even comes through on DVD, and it still feels alive and fresh.  This production is very much worth seeing!",1311033600,,1366,4.754237288135593
3367912,1,B0014IC320,"I saw the original production with Dean Jones and then with Larry Kert--and the amazing Donna McKechnie (and Barbara Barrie and Susan Browning and others). And I've listened to the cast album for years. These songs are old friends of mine. I agree with another reviewer--this production was an abomination. I really tried to like it as simply a different interpretation. But really, having the actors play the instruments (instead of a full orchestra) and march around the stage was annoying and stupid. Raul Esperanza was a smarmy Bobbie instead of charming, and his singing was annoying to listen to. The only bright spot in this production was the actress playing  Joanne (Elaine Stritch's role). Don't waste your time on this production. Instead, if you get a chance, see the Philharmonic production with Neil Patrick Harris as Bobbie--probably the best portrayal I've seen. It was recorded and recently shown at select movie theaters around the county and I was lucky enough to see it. I hope they put that on DVD--I'll buy it in a nano-second!",1308960000,13,1049,4.9602272727272725
3367913,4,B0014IC320,"I love Sondheim, and I cannot imagine not viewing anything I can get my hands on. I liked the new Company. I'd heard a story on NPR explaining that all of the actors would carry and play instruments in lieu of an orchestra. Often, It was too much, and it felt like a way to cut costs rather than be creative. It greatly slowed down ""you can drive a person crazy"", as those poor women were expected to play and sing the difficult, fast song. However, it made ""Sorry-Grateful"" very intimate and touching.

Finally, I'm not sure about Bobby. Well, I'm pretty sure I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was Raul Esparza who played Bobby, or John Doyle who directed Bobby. Either way, Bobby was this soul searching, intense, kinda downer guy through the whole musical. At the beginning, he is suppose to take his friends kids to the zoo, the women to the Opera (and like it), he sleeps around without apologizes, and he knows where to score if you want a bit of something-something for a party. In other words, Bobby was supposed to be the life of the party until his epiphany that he wanted to grow up and get married, have a family. Since he was already intense, there was no where to go.

Still, watch it, especially it you haven't seen it before. It isn't done often, and it might a long time before you get a chance to see it live.",1303603200,2,1332,4.3453815261044175

I think the absence of subtitles is particularly important here, because the singers' diction, while very good, is not as absolutely clear as it might be, or as it is on the original cast recording of COMPANY. And of course Sondheim's lyrics are tricky enough that at some point almost everyone is going to need subtitles to follow them.

Another reviewer has already mentioned a certain overintensity in the lead performer. I didn't notice that, but the singer who does ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" is overintense indeed. This is her decision, and the song is so famous for its mordancy that I can hardly blame her for overplaying its bitterness, but I think a touch of humor would have made the song better, and that finally it collapses under the extreme self-importance she imparts to it.

Any Broadway lover will delight in this version. The performances are first class. The musical numbers unique and delightful. The direction is well paced and methodical. If you missed it on Broadway (I didn't), you can enjoy it now in this stellar production. I find myself enjoying COMPANY more than I did in New York.

This being said, i never thought it would go beyond a cursory look of how dysfunctional marriages tend to be.  The original production explored this issue with a fair amount of restraint, but this new production got so raw, you tend to forget that they're actors onstage.  This production touched a nerve, to the point i internally debated turning it off for a while.  I think that's what's interesting about the way this was done; beyond the actor/musician thing, and the multiple vantage points, everything seemed to be so REAL.  As much as i am tempted to shower Raul Esparza with praises (which he obviously deserves), this is more the ensemble's triumph.

3367941,5,B0014IC320,"""Company"" is musical theater for a sophisticated audience - filled with the bitingly clever lyrics and musical complexity that typify the best of Sondheim. ""Company"" consists of a series of vignettes exploring the nature of relationships seen through the eyes of 35 year old, single Bobby - and the truthfulness expressed will certainly resonate with people of a similar age.

The production is striking with director John Doyle employing his trademark schtick of the performers singing, acting, AND performing the music (for another example of this you should listen to the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd-2005-Broadway-Revival-Cast/dp/B000CRR3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd (2005 Broadway Revival Cast)</a>).

3367943,2,B0014IC320,"Loving the theater, I am always excited to see a staged performance captured on DVD.  I hope more and more will be forthcoming.  Therefore I am loath to say anything negative about any such offering.  However, I didn't particularly care for ""Company"".  Let me be clear, it is not the production itself but the source material I did not enjoy.

This production is my first experience with ""Company"".  I just did not enjoy Sondheim's score or the story.  It was all pretty depressing and glum.  The point of view felt rather cynical and jaded.  I couldn't identify or recognize anything desirable in the characters or relationships.  Some of the dialogue had a very dated feel (though expected in a musical from 1970, it was not enjoyed).  It felt bound to a time and place - not one filled with wonder and excitement, but one that I am glad has been left behind.  One I have no joy in visiting.  Overall, the characters were not engaging due to their emotional detachment and the plastic veneer surrounding them.  Everything was a facade.

On the positive side, Raul Esparza is a very talented singer and actor (I loved him in the recording of Jonathan Larson's ""Tick... Tick...Boom!"").  The rest of the ensemble was also generally good.  There were several humorous moments despite the general melancholy feel.  The sparse staging and the actors doubling as instrumentalists took a bit of getting used to, but it was successful enough in the end.  I will not go so far as to say it added to the production, but it was passable.  I do wonder if such technique should be used if it does not truly enhance the material, though.  Doesn't one wish to see the best staging possible?  I am not sure this is it.

If you like ""Company"" or are a fan of Sondheim, I would highly recommend you check out this production.  The talented cast and innovative staging just couldn't overcome the material itself for me.  Certainly that is a matter of taste.",1223078400,3,1939,4.648967551622419
3367944,5,B0014IC320,"I loved Company when I saw it on Broadway, but the concept, with the actors working with musical instruments in hand during the performance, was distracting and took away from the show.

Raul Esparza is terrific throughout, and the Sondheim score is, at turns, beautiful, funny and relevant throughout.

3367945,4,B0014IC320,"Sondheim's finest musical has finally been recorded for posterity and this production by PBS is excellent. A number of camera angles provide a brilliant capture of the performance and give a feeling that almost surpasses sitting in the Ethel Barrymore theatre itself. The sound and picture quality are spot on and the only disappointing element (causing the loss of a star) is the lack of Extras. They amount to two poorly filmed interviews with confident star Raul Esparza and director John Doyle; and the surprising inclusion of an interview conducted with Sondheim by Jonathan Biggins for Foxtel and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when he attended the opening of Kookaburra musical theatre's 2007 production of Company - which was far inferior to the main feature of this DVD and performed in the standard manner (i.e. without the actors also playing the instruments). Where are the 'backstage' extras - e.g. filming the cast in preparation in their dressing rooms, or any rehearsal footage? The path to putting this version on stage would have involved some interesting rehearsal processes to get the staging right with the inclusion of the instruments - a feature on this aspect would have been eagerly welcomed.

3367947,5,B0014IC320,"When I was younger I saw this show and shrugged it off as a fun but two-dimensional spoof of marital relations.  Now that I am the age of the characters and a bit more seasoned in the ways of the world, however, I see things differnetly. This show is an emotional knock-out. Company is a gentle whirlwind of humor, desperation, hurt, love and alienation, delivered through great songs and quirky performances. The production and the material are amazing, wringing out thoughts and fears that I was not even aware were simmering below the surface.

Raul Esparza has a Bob Newhart-type delivery that works well in playing Bobby, and the character is all too familiar to anyone who has been the lonely but loved buddy-brother-father confessor to an extended group of friends. The other actors are equally good.  While I don't have all of their names handy, I offer extensive applause to the women who played Amy, Marta, and JoAnn.  I also applaud Bruce Sabbath, who plays Larry with a sense of kindness and patience even though he knows he is underappreciated and mistreated by his wife.

The staging and costuming evoke an upscale, Bobby Short-type piano lounge, communicating simultaneously a sense of Upper East Side glamour and urban world worriness.  Given the setting and millieu of the show,this visual effect is brilliant.

I saw the version of Sweeney Todd that had the cast accompanying themselves on musical instruments.  In that production, the approach seemed to be a pointless gimmick.  In Company, however, the approach works.  The cast members are a ""company,"" in a musical, acting and social sense.

3367951,5,B0014IC320,"If you're looking for one word: genius.

If you're looking for a few more, however....

This is perhaps Stephen Sondheim's greatest work.  Arguable, but certainly a matter of opinion.  His lyrics are incomparable, and the tone of the music is conversational - perfectly suited to George Furth's casual-style book.  The emotional release in Being Alive sends a timeless message, not only in context of the show, but outside it as well.  Any composer or lyricist who can make a song apply so perfectly both inside and outside of a show is, without doubt, genius.

Now - the direction.  Everyone has their opinion on John Doyle's actors doubling as musicians.  In Sweeney I found it to be distasteful.  Instead of that, however, it simply suits this style of show.  It's all a concept show, and it all takes place in Robert's head.  Robert's singing songs about marriage in his head, why would it be inconceivable for him to imagine his friends playing instruments in accompaniment to his musings?  Not only does it make sense, it just works.  The staging could almost not be better.  The acting and singing is fantastic.  I could ask for a little more as far as instrumentals - meaning better - but I won't.

The entire show, you feel the build.  You feel this build in tension, and then you get a complete release of it all in Being Alive.  Having just watched Passion, that is something you don't get from that show.  Company is a complete release, a definite end to the story being told.  But at the same time, the story does not end.  Sondheim and Furth supply closure without closing.  This is enhanced particularly by John Doyle's cut of the finale.

Lastly, Raul Esparza.  No more words need to be said, but I'll say them anyway.  His interpretation of Bobby is sublime.  Unreal.  The motif of the entire play is the theme of the opening number, and Raul captures that chaos in his acting.  You can see that Bobby is in constant thought, and it puts you into his shoes - you start to see what he sees, in order to grasp what he might be thinking about.  The way he is able to contain his voice in ""Someone is Waiting"" is perfect.  There could not have been a better actor found, I think, to play Bobby in this revival.

Overall - near perfection on stage.  The staging of Being Alive is the embodiment of theatre.  I say it every time I watch it.  I'm more and more captivated each time.",1218672000,4,2392,4.522248243559719

3367957,4,B0014IC320,"The expressions on Raul Esparza's face detail the rumblings beneath the surface that Stephen Sondheim finds fascinating.

This 2006 Tony-winning revival received a mixed response from audiences and critics alike. But then, COMPANY is a show that is always divisive. For starters, the show has no ""plot"" in a conventional sense. That bothers some viewers. It also uses songs to express attitudes rather than advance the story (again, what story?) But those subtle lingering looks, the unexpected responses, the sighs, the pauses...they communicate so much about these characters, and that is beautifully captured in this video.

No, it is not the COMPANY that was seen on Broadway in 1970. Given the advances it presaged, I expect that to see an archival reconstruction of the original might now look horribly dated.  Jonathan Doyle has given the show a fresh perspective by having the company of actors double as musicians. It's a stunt he tried before with SWEENEY TODD to much acclaim. Unfortunately, coming after SWEENEY critics tended to be very blaze about the whole thing. Yeah, What else can you do?

But the concept actually works better with Company and is far less distracting. You do not miss the full orchestra as much here as with the more operatic SWEENEY. It makes the story more intimate and personal. The concept has a few drawbacks. Several times numbers end by segueing back into dialogue, frustrating an audience that wants to applaud but keeping the rhythm steady.

The rock steady performance of Raul Esparza anchors the entire show. It's performance that earned him high praise - and a Tony nomination - and years from now people will talk about. But unlike Dean Jones in the original they'll be able to do more than talk about it: they can see it thanks to this DVD.",1215043200,6,1790,4.9335548172757475

That's the way it ought to be....

Only Stephen Sondheim could come up with such sophisticated couplets to a love song as disquieting as the beautiful ""Marry Me a Little"". I was very fortunate to have seen the enthralling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-production/dp/B000LV6R4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 production</a>&nbsp;at the Ethel Barrymore Theater last season, and I'm thrilled it has been captured for posterity on DVD as part of PBS's ""Great Performances"" series. There is something supremely ironic about how a 37-year old show, already revived twice, can feel fresher than most Broadway musicals written today. However, when the music reflects Sondheim at his most accomplished with performers so adept, it becomes a moot point, even though several of the songs here have been inescapable at karaoke bars for years from the lips of overly zealous musical theater aficionados.

Staged like a minimalist cabaret act, John Doyle's joyous revival uses the same technique he used in his 2005 production of Sondheim's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd/dp/B000CRR3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd</a>, specifically he has the actors play their own musical instruments, a daring move which actually helps underline the characters' feelings. The story is blessedly simple as it revolves around perennial bachelor Bobby, as he turns 35 and observes his circle of upscale Manhattanite friends, five married couples at different stages in various vignettes that make him reconsider what he wants out of life. Juggling three girlfriends, Bobby is a likeable but elliptical figure with commitment issues, and the story really follows his journey toward self-acceptance. There is an element of contrivance to the structure, but what I thought would be a severely dated libretto by George Furth continues to resonate with wit and insight.

For a canon as legendary and often erratic as his, Sondheim's sophisticated music and lyrics never seemed as accessible and hummable as they do here. So much of the show rides on the crucial casting of Bobby, and Ral Esparza is terrifically bold and poignant in managing the precarious balance between yearning romantic and cynical hedonist. With a beautifully expressive singing voice coupled with a common-guy demeanor, he captures the character's arc with an escalating emotional intensity from the measured romanticism of ""Someone Is Waiting"" to the tender tentativeness of ""Marry Me a Little"" (with the beautiful, Sondheim-trademarked rolling piano) to the bursting climactic catharsis of ""Being Alive"".

The rest of the cast accomplish wonderful moments that already come with high expectations - Heather Laws' dexterously motors her way through ""Getting Married Today"" with her character's nerve-wracking intensity intact; Elizabeth Stanley brings a likable warmth to the dim-bulb flight attendant April as she duets sweetly with Esparza on the comically post-coital ""Barcelona""; Angel Desai's saucy turn as hip Marta on ""Another Hundred People""; the poignant ""Sorry-Grateful"" performed by the comparatively less spotlighted male ensemble; and of course, there are the lacerating observations in ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", handled with fierce worldliness by Barbara Walsh as Joanne. In the intimidating shadow of Elaine Stritch, Walsh lets out repeated primal screams at the end that pierce with wounding acuity.

TV director Lonny Price does a fluent job transferring the production to the small screen with minimum fuss. The 2008 DVD contains three terrific extras. First, there is a fifteen-minute interview with an articulate and thoughtful Esparza who discusses his connection with Bobby, the challenge of learning piano, and the alternating joy and pressure of working with Sondheim (for the third time). There is also a nine-minute interview with the erudite Doyle who explains how his unique use of actors as musicians went over with Sondheim. The centerpiece has to be a fascinating, 38-minute interview that Australian TV personality Jonathan Biggins conducted with Sondheim last year in Sydney's Theatre Royal. Sondheim is particularly forthcoming with humorous anecdotes about working with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand, and his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II during his long, illustrious career.  This is a wonderful DVD for any Broadway aficionado and particularly for fans of Sondheim, Esparza and Doyle. I happen to be all three.",1211414400,63,4666,5.7452966714905935
3367967,5,B0014IC320,"Company is one of my favorite Sondheim shows so far (the others being Sweeney Todd and Sunday in the Park with George). It's a show that requires good acting and showcases outstanding acting. The ensemble numbers are beautiful. The Original Broadway Cast recording sounds very 1970s-ish, but the revival orchestration has updated the music to sound modern and classy. The musical has three of my favorite songs: ""Being Alive,"" ""The Ladies Who Lunch,"" and ""Getting Married Today."" The show is funny and witty, but it carries a strong message, too. Marriage, in fact any kind of commitment, is a compromise. It sucks that when we choose one path, we close many others, but that's what life is about. Life is about making choices. There's nothing wrong with Bobby being a bachelor. The problem is that it's all he knows. He's never tried anything else. He's never made a choice; he's always waiting to see what other people do. Joanne's stinging number ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" reminds Bobby (and the audience) that you can sit around wasting your life pretending you're actually living it. Delusion is insidious. There are so many ways to waste time, whether it's going to fittings, taking in high art like Mahler symphonies and Pinter plays, mocking other people, surfing the internet (wait, that's not in the musical...)
I loved Raul Esparza as Bobby. He played a very calm, sweet guy who gradually becomes more and more distraught about being as an outsider.  His rendition of ""Being Alive"" is amazing, beyond words.  The supporting cast is directed to be that -- ""supporting"" so if you're looking for an Elaine Strich-like ""Ladies"", get the OBC recording.  I like this choice, because it makes Bobby the focal point, as it should be.
This revival is in the controversial John Doyle actor-doubling-as-musician style.  The fact that the instruments were onstage gave the musical a cabaret feel. The cabaret feel was enhanced by the simple, black costumes and mostly bare set. Marriage and relationships are an intimate topic and the intimate setting works wonderfuly. The piano was used very effectively. I liked seeing Marta sing while sitting on top of the piano. I liked watching Bobby clumsily climb on top of the piano (emphasizing that he's still a boyish voyeur). I liked how the actor stopped playing the piano and closed the keyboard case just as Barbara Walsh was finishing ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" There were some instances where the actors-playing-instruments concept didn't work, but for the most part, I enjoyed it and the great camera direction by Lonny Price made the actor movement not too distracting.",1211328000,53,2616,4.993119266055046

The performances were quite good and Raul Esparza was completely dominating in his performance of Bobby.  I did have a few problems with some of the casting, but they were minor and the show was quite watchable.  The final number, Being Alive, was enough to make you stand and take notice.

With that being said, some of the camera-work on this is what causes it to lose a star.  Its difficult to capture the entire stage in a show like this, and there are parts where the entire stage is used.  The DVD is well worth the price and a must-have for any fan of musicals.  Sondheim's works are always worth viewing, and this is absolutely no exception.",1210723200,,764,4.525547445255475

3367971,3,B0014IC320,"COMPANY is a great show, and I've worn out several Original Cast recordings and somehow I have not burned out my well-used CD.

I saw this production, both on Broadway (on the night it was being filmed), and again when it appeared on PBS.  It is worth seeing and hearing if you do not know the original, but for all its cleverness, it misses the core of the show,  and also misses some of the most important parts of the original.

To save money, this production cuts out the orchestra, and the actors play the instruments.  They aren't bad players, but not up to a Broadway standard.  They do have a few good spots.  But all the terrific original orchestrations are gone, gone gone, and they were particularly strong arrangements.  The most dramatic example is the evisceration of the whole bedroom scene before the song ""Barcelona."" The big section removed was both a brilliant piece of orchestration, but an important set up to the song and, especially, insight into the character of Bobby.

Other songs that suffer are ""Another 100 People Just Got Off of the Bus"" and ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy,"" songs that really kick into another level with a big, capable orchestra.  In this show all you get is accompaniment.  I'll never forget the great dance orchestrations the late, great Wally Harper did for the original show, and it makes me sad to see all this flash gone.

The other thing wrong with this show is how Bobby is played, or imagined.  Raul Esparza does have a sort of flash himself, and the audience obviously likes him, and many may have come to see him, but he just doesn't get Bobby, or he just cannot do the ambiguous or warmer sides of Bobby's character.

Raul Esparza plays Bobby like a pure cynic, and Bobby is not a pure cynic.  Yes, he may do things that are cynical, but in many ways he needs to be the least cynical of all the characters in this show.  He weighs and grows and evolves and devolves before our eyes, but he just doesn't sit back and poke at all around him the way Bobby does here.

This show needs a fresher performance than the one Esparza gives.

Despite all these real problems, I was still happy to see the show, even to see the same production again on TV.  Most of the cast is strong.  The performance of ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" was so strong the audience could not even clap at the end, they were so into it, and she nailed it so.

But this show needs an orchestra, and needs a more thoughtful or imaginative performance by Bobby.",1207872000,16,2480,4.454545454545454
3367972,1,B0014IC320,"John Doyle's gimmicky production of this Sondheim/Furth masterpiece is nothing short of an abomination. His conceit of having the cast play their own instruments (there is no orchestra) is cheesy and distracting. Instead of honest acting and straightforward storytelling, Doyle gives us pseudo-symbolism, actors talking into the air instead of to each other and staging that is so obtuse that anyone not already intimately familiar with COMPANY will be utterly baffled. Doyle's COMPANY is not the brilliant musical play the authors wrote; it is more like an acting class exercise. The poor cast (most of them very talented) ought to have mutinied; they probably could have directed themselves far better than this charlatan. Save your money and buy the original 1970 Broadway cast CD instead. And let us hope that one day there will be a commercial video release of a REAL production of COMPANY.",1207785600,21,895,5.179310344827586
3367973,5,B0014IC320,"Unfortunately, I was not able to see the live production in New York, but I can only imagine how amazing it must have been just watching the recording. Raul Esparza (yes, the one deserving the Tony) has the amazing gift of being able to stand absolutely still, and still draw you in sheerly by the emotion and power in his voice. The entire cast performed extraordinarily; when you're not marveling at their singing performances, you're marveling at how in the world someone can walk around, play an instrument (or in some cases, several instruments) and still manage to sing at the same time. Although this format (having actors playing instruments with minimal staging/set) probably won't work for many musicals, I found it very well done/used in this production. Altogether, thoroughly awesome :)",1206835200,6,799,5.0606060606060606
3367974,5,B0014IC320,"Aside from seeing the production live on stage (I agree with other reviewers, Raul should have won the Tony for this performance), I've seen this video production.  Not only on PBS, where the quality was so-so, but a copy of this disc.  It's not out yet officially, but it's out already.  The quality of the picture is far superior to that shown on television, and the production itself is very exciting and innovative.  This is definitely one show you'd want to add to your collection.",1206144000,11,486,4.682352941176471
3367975,5,B0014IC320,"I saw the show twice on Broadway and watched it on PBS. The PBS production is wonderfully directed and captures the feel of the show beautifully. The close ups on Raul Esparza show off his wonderful performance and shows that he SHOULD have won the Tony award. The show is feels fresh and new and is still relevant today. The cast is strong, especially Barbara Walsh and Keith Buterbaugh.

It is an excellent show and this DVD will be an excellent memory for those who saw the production on stage and for those who missed out.",1205452800,12,526,4.479166666666667

8255846,5,B0014IC320,"I loved this unique take on one of my favorite musicals. I remember hearing about this production when it was on Broadway, but being a little suspicious of the fact that the cast also functioned as the orchestra. When I was finally able to see the show on this DVD, my fears were completely washed away. The way the show incorporates each actor's instrument into a part of their character is excellent and helps to add additional depth (Bobby on the other hand plays no instrument, aside from a kazoo in one funny instance, until the finale to accentuate his isolation). The acting and singing are all top notch, especially from Raul Esparza as Bobby whose more laid-back take on the role than I've seen before emphasizes just how different he is from his married friends. There is not a weak link in the rest of the cast, who are all excellent. The DVD itself is relatively bare-bones, however with a production such as this I only really came for the show itself, which was of the highest quality.",1497484800,,999,4.58659217877095
8255847,5,B0014IC320,"After watching a friend's copy of this production of Company, I wanted to purchase my own copy so that I could watch it anytime I wanted. I read many of the reviews, both good and bad. Many didn't like the addition of the cast playing instruments that they believed got in the way of telling the story. Many preferred Neil Patrick Harris or Dean Jones who played Bobby in the original production although he was replaced soon after opening night by Larry Kert. After reading many of the harshest reviews, I went back and watched several different versions of Sondheim's brilliant work, especially the closing number Being Alive. It's a wonderful song and many outstanding artist have performed it. Each doing so with their own wonderful artistic interpretation. The fact that there is debate about which artist does the better performance lends extra credence to the brilliance of Sondheim and in the case of this particular version, John Doyle. The like or dislike by the audience is in direct proportion to how a writer, director or actor tells a story through narrative or through song. I watched the video of Raul Esparza's acceptance speech on receiving the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for his work in Company. One of the most important things he said was that John Doyle showed him how to get out of his own way, to stop acting, to quit making faces and showing off. Raul said that John Doyle found inside him all the things he had always been longing to express by simply standing still. That is the brilliance of any Raul Esparza performance and Company is no exception. Raul can simply stand still and let his voice tell the story. The passion and emotion in his voice truly speaks to the audience in a way that after hearing you feel like you are part of the journey. Hats off to  Sondheim, Doyle, Esparza and the entire cast of Company because as Raul also said in his acceptance speech, even when he is singing solo, the other 13 members of the cast are singing with him.",1493424000,,2007,4.637640449438202

What sucked, though, was the fact that I ended getting a ex library copy with all those wonderful library stickers covering  up the box art (not the cheap DVD case it came in, but the actual paper artwork that was too small for the said DVD case)",1483142400,,461,4.2272727272727275

8255852,4,B0014IC320,"Having seen the original a number of times, both on Broadway and on tour, I'm not a fan of this revival. I don't think the conceit of having the actors doubling as instrumentalists feels at all organic, so it feels more contrived and distracting than anything else. And there are a number of revisions that don't add much to either streamlining or fine-tuning the show. The 2011 concert version is not only closer in feel to the original, it also sticks more closely to the original script.",1461974400,2,490,4.64367816091954
