8173789,5,B000N0T3Q4,"If Frank McCourt had been my history teacher growing up I would have been a history major. This is the way history needs to be taught. I laughed, I cried, but most of all I learned.",1399680000,2,181,4.055555555555555
8173790,5,B000N0T3Q4,"This was a really great play. Kind of a comedy / drama. I loved the soundtrack, too. It made me proud to be Irish and happy to know that my quirks are OK cuz they're hereditary. lol.",1330473600,3,182,3.945945945945946
8173791,5,B000N0T3Q4,"A great combination of Irish and Irish-American spoken word, poetry, music, and a dash of dance.  Frank McCourt, the Irish Repertory Theater, and Ciaran O'Reilly tell the tale of the Irish and Irish-Americans in their own voice.  The female leads of the show are bold as brass with beautiful voices.  By turns comic and dramatic, you will be moved and entertained.  Even though this video is not available on DVD (yet) and was shot on a theater stage, it feels as if they are performing in your own living room.  I recommend that you buy 3 copies while you can: two to have and one to give away.  Slainte!",1305849600,5,605,4.504587155963303
