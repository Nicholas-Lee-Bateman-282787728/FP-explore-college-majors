3656851,5,B001JAHPR6,"What is the date for the release of season 3? What is the hold up? I have purchased season 1 and 2, but cannot find the rest...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CHiPs-Season-3/dp/B001JAHPR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CHiPs: Season 3</a>",1233964800,7,272,7.53125
3656852,5,B001JAHPR6,I always loved this show! I feel the stunts in it rival the ones in Dukes of Hazzard and A-team or Fall Guy. I'm really excited to collect all the seasons. Season 3 of Chips can't come soon enough!,1230854400,13,197,4.076923076923077
3656853,5,B001JAHPR6,"I can hardly wait till Warner Bros. gets this 1979-80 Season of this police drama released on DVD, since it's a definite upgrade from the first 2 seasons even though this season had us mourning the loss of Jon & Ponch's spunky fellow CHP officer(Sindy Cahill)after only one season since Brianne Leary departed the series in the Spring of 1979 just before CHiPs had its 3rd Season underway in the Summer of 1979.

As a matter of fact, this is also the season when Randi Oakes joins the cast as California Highway Patrol Officer Bonnie Clark replacing her predecessor Sindy Cahill(Brianne Leary) as the new 7-Charles and when California Highway Patrol Officer Jeb Turner(Michael Dorn) replaces his predecessor Officer Gene Fritz(Lew Saunders) as the new 7-David along with the fact that the 3rd Season is also the 2nd season with a female co-star on CHiPs.

Additionally, I noticed that all the CHP Kawasaki motorcycle units, especially Ponch & Jon's are more upgraded in the Third Season than they were in the first 2 seasons of CHiPs, since the windshield & rims were better looking & more upgraded.

CHiPs 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I used to watch this police drama on NBC every Saturday night during the first half of the 1979-80 Season and then when I started watching it every Sunday night during the second half of the Third Season, since NBC had moved CHiPs from Saturdays to Sundays back in March of 1980, which gave me something to look forward to on Sundays, since I've never been a big fan of Sundays.

Additionally, this season also had some pretty interesting episodes in it too like
*In ""Roller Disco"", Ponch & Jon meet a lot of celebrities in Santa Monica while tracking down crooks and while trying to help out a distressed overworked teen musician(Leif Garrett) in turmoil.

*In ""Drive Lady, Drive"" Ponch falls head over heels in love for a foxy racedriver(Kelly Harmon) while they try to help an abandoned little girl find her family.

*In ""The Watch Commander"", an ornery CHP superior officer wreaks havoc at CHP Central Division while Lt. Bates(Granville Van-Dusen) steals the show by temporarily taking over Getraers command at Central making the hard-nosed Sgt. Joe Getraer(Robert Pine)practically look like a wuss, especially since the often exasperated Getraer was outranked by the insensitive Bates.

*In ""High Octane"" Sindy Cahill(Brianne Leary) comes back for this one episode to help Ponch & Jon track gasoline crooks who tried to kill Getraer in the process during a pursuit on the freeway.

*In ""Return Of The Supercycle"" Ponch(Erik Estrada) gets hurt while pursuing a robber who is posing as the same motorcycle phantom as the one in the ""Supercycle"" episode prompting Harlan(Lou Wagner) & Jon(Larry Wilcox) to bring back the CHP Supercycle to catch the crook, except this time Jon uses it instead of Ponch while Ponch is in the hospital recuperating.

*In the ""Off Road"" episode Jon & Ponch go to the Mojave desert in Jon's bitchin GMC 4X4 pick up on their day off and discover that some greedy reckless racers are after some gold nearby, which Ponch & Jon end up getting involved in.

*In the ""E.M.T."" episode, Jon & Ponch get make a lot of intense heroic saves and get involved with an arrogant paramedic(Bill Smith) while taking some medical courses and end up making the paramedic see the error of his ways at the end of the episode when he gets injured on the job by losing his legs.

*In the ""Counterfeit"" episode Jon & Ponch try to help out a harassed midget(Billy Barty) while tracking down a counterfeit ring ran by a hypocrite pastor(Andrew Duggan).

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Bill Daly in the ""Roller Disco"" episode after his co-starring days on I DREAM OF JEANNIE

*Granville Van-Dusen in ""The Watch Commander"" episode before his co-starring days on PORT CHARLES and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Famous football player/actor(Jim Brown) in the ""Roller Disco"" episode

*Michael Conrad in the ""Drive Lady, Drive"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on HILL STREET BLUES

*Dana Plato in the ""Nightingale"" episode during her early co-starring days as Kimberly Drummond on DIFFERENT STROKES

*James Luisi in ""The Strippers"" episode after his co-starring days as Becker's high-strung superior officer(Lt. Chapman) on THE ROCKFORD FILES

*Jared Martin in the ""Hot Wheels"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Meredith Mac Rae in the ""Off Road"" episode after her co-starring days as Bobbi Jo on PETTICOAT JUNCTION

*Martin Kove in the ""Hot Wheels"" episode before his co-starring days on CAGNEY & LACY and before he even co-starred in the movie THE KARATE KID

*Morgan Woodward in ""The Strippers"" episode before his co-starring days on DALLAS

*John McCook in the ""Thrill Show"" episode before his co-starring days on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL and THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Seeing cameo appearances by Ed McMahon, Susan Richardson, Todd Bridges, Cindy Williams, etc. in the ""Roller Disco"" episode.

*Ellen Bry in the ""High Octane"" episode before her co-starring days on ST. ELSEWHERE

*Larry Storch in the ""Roller Disco"" episode after his co-starring days on F-TROOP

*Rick Hurst in the ""Death Watch"" episode before his co-starring days as Boss Hogg's clumsy Deputy Cletus Hogg on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD

*Michelle Pfeiffer in ""The Watch Commander"" episode before she became a star

*Tracy Gold in the ""Drive Lady, Drive"" episode before her Carol Seaver days on GROWING PAINS

*Andy Robinson in the ""Hot Wheels"" episode after his co-starring days on the soap opera RYAN'S HOPE

*Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes in the ""Off Road"" episode

*April Clough in the ""Nightengale"" episode before her co-starring days as Officer Vicki Taylor on T.J. HOOKER

In the meantime, I don't see what is taking Warner Bros. so long to bring this 1979-80 Season of this police drama out on DVD, but it may perhaps be due to today's ugly economy or Warner Bros. apparently not making enough sales on CHiPs-2nd Season DVD in the Summer of 2008, which may perhaps be due to the recession going on right now.

However, since Warner Bros. hasn't released Season 3 on up, especially since Warner Bros. hasn't released any more individual season DVD box sets since the Summer of 2008 when CHiPs 2nd Season was released and still has 4 more seasons to go to complete this police dramas whole 6-year run on NBC, I'm starting to wonder if Warner Bros. will decide to overcompensate the same way Mill Creek did with the police drama HUNTER since Mill Creek recently released a complete series DVD box set of HUNTER since Anchor Bay hasn't released another idividual season box set since the Summer of 2007 when HUNTERs 3rd Season was released on DVD.

Therefore I'm starting to wonder if Warner Bros. or any other DVD corportation will end up overcompensating by releasing a CHiPs: The Complete Series DVD like Mill Creek recently released HUNTER:The Complete Series DVD in order to give us the last 4 seasons of HUNTER that still haven't been released as individual season box sets just like Warner Bros. still hasn't released any of the remaining 4 seasons of CHiPs on individual season DVD box sets.",1227484800,79,7184,4.90016501650165

I like the packaging of my DVD's and they all play very well most of my seasons I bought new except 1 but they all play and can't wait to obtain seasons 4, 5 and 6.

Please keep the series coming, and don't wait so long between seasons! The DVD quality looks great, I'm sure it looks better than when it was originally broadcast. Sound is good, dialogue is clear, music is cheesy. The 5 disc 6 set comes with a slipcase and a 4 page booklet with episode summaries.

3657190,5,B001JAHPR6,"As my title says, Finally.  Its been a long time coming for Season 3, and it will not disappoint.  I may not have watched the entire disc set as of yet, but CHiPs is like a police action lover's paradise.  The intense, multi-car/truck crashes on the freeways around Los Angeles, the crazy antics of Ponch who along with John, Sgt. Getraer and the rest of the supporting cast that made CHiPs a household name back in the 70's and early 80's. I remember long ago, well 2005 and 2006, when Seasons 1 and 2 we're released and it brought me back to my childhood watching the show with my dad every week.  So, I figured along with all the other fans that Season 3 would follow suit and be released in 2007, but none of us got our CHiPs 'fix' for another 9 years, after which most other TV DVD sets we're being released regularly.

Great show, keeps you riveted, especially since I recall very little of the individual episodes, except that it had motorcycles, spectacular car crashes, and the caring, but tough Seargeant.  Let's hope it doesn't take another 9 years for Season 4 to be released.  If that trend continues, I'll be an old man when the final season comes out.",1431734400,3,1166,4.446009389671362

3657228,5,B001JAHPR6,In this season Jon and Ponch are on patrol again with trouble brewing around every corner.  Ponch is hurt while on patrol and ends up in the hospital with a broken arm and ribs but this is due to the real life accident to Erik Estrada who plays Ponch where he broke his arm in while riding a motorcycle during shooting so they incorporated it into the season that Ponch got hurt and use it to advance the plot of the season.

3657247,4,B001JAHPR6,"It's been a long wait, but the hot seventies roller-disco mama's in short-shorts and halter/tube tops with Dorothy Hamill hair-do's are back, along with both has-been and future celebrities, and the crashing/flipping/speeding craptastic '70's cars and bikes!

What isn't back, thankfully are the el-cheapo flipper discs (i.e., double-sided) which are historically destined to fail. The individual slimline disc cases are gone, replaced by a single stacker case. AFAIK, there's been ZERO restoration of either picture or soundtrack and no Hi-Rez re-scan. Disappointing, especially considering the price they're charging. Vid and sound quality are, therefore, variable with some visible pic degradation (noise and soft rez) and soundtrack issues (wow/flutter, drop-outs, no extended HF response, etc,). Aditionally, no special features of any kind are included, unlike previous release(s)

Lightweight content aside, this has become a cult classic for many, myself included! I love the show, and while I'm happy to be gradually replacing my inferior UK bootleg DVD's of all 6 seasons dubbed from off-air VCR sources, they could have, and should have, done better!

Regardless, it's good, clean fun and wholesome family entertainment...Highly Recommended!

3657389,5,B001JAHPR6,"I  am  pleased  it  finally  came  out.  I  think  the  show  is  terriffic!  2  motorcycle  cops  out  there  who  actually  know  how  to  make  a  difference.  The  show  has  taught  me  to  respect  any  motorcycle  cop  on  the  highway.  John  &  Frank  handle  stuff  big  &  small.  Some  of  the  accidents  I've  seen  are  the  kind  where  electricity  poles  get  knocked  over,  or  broken  in  half.  &  In  one  episode  they  try  to  keep  a  car  from  going  over  a  600  ft  cliff,  while  the  third  officer  tries  to  get  a  mother  &  2  kids  out  of  the  car.  Its  not  long  before  it  goes  over.  &  they  always  deal  with  roadragers  on  the  freeways.  They  always  give  kids  advice,  confidence  for  example.  Stuff  like  that. As well as  helping  folks  who  fight  on  freeways  sort  out  they're  differences.  What  we  see  in  this  season  2  groups  whites  &  Hispanics  fighting  on  the  road  &  at  the  beach.  I  would  have  never  guessed  they'd  be  getting  along  at  the  end  of  the  show.  That's  what  IM  talking  about.  Frank  &  John  I  got  to  give  them  2  thumbs  up!
Anyways  I  am  enjoying  the  show.  &  Im  looking  forward  to  seeing  season  4  come  out.  &  I'll  wait  as  long  as  I  have  to!  People?  Don't  ask  me  how  desperate  I  am!  When  I  get  all  the  seasons,  whew!  Won't  I  be  relieved!!  Its  funny?  I  watched  the  other  show  In  the  Heat  of  the  night with Carroll O Connor.  All  seasons  came  out  in  such  a  short  amount  of  time  One after the other.  Why  can't  they  do  the  same  with  Chips?  It  doesn't  make  any  sense!!
Don't  worry  I  won't  go  on  &  on  about  it!  As  long  as  Warner Bros  understands  where  Im  coming  from. We  all  have  do  only  one  thing,  Hold  our  breath  &  keep  our  fingers  crossed!!!!!!!!!!!!  Definitely  a  show  worth  watching,  &  I'm  just  as  eager  as  the  rest  of  you  guys  out  there  to  receive  the  rest  of  the  seasons!  Erik Estrada?  Tell  them  to  hurry  up  with  the  3  remaining  seasons!  Your  about  the  only  one  who  can  convince  them!  We're  all  very  impatient!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1425513600,9,2212,4.140495867768595

3657403,4,B001JAHPR6,"Season 3 of Chips is finally here.  Follow California Highway Patrol officers Jon Baker and Francis ""Ponch"" Poncherello as they chase down speeders, look for thieves, race down the highways of California in pursuit of drunk drivers and other violators.  One case involves a stunt driver who hopes to cash in on an insurance scheme.  Another case involves conflict between rival youth groups at the beach.  Part of the appeal of the Chips series is the California scenery and the interaction of Jon and Ponch as they dispense justice.  The cast works well together, including Robert Pine as the CHP officer in command.  The team is close knit and the action is non-stop.",1425081600,3,669,4.876106194690266
3657404,4,B001JAHPR6,"Happy to see the next (and possibly best) installment of this iconic show finally being released.  Though many episodes have not dated well (the disco boom of the late 70's is a recurring and often tiresome story element), ""Chips"" was one of those entertaining family shows of the kind that no longer exists on network television.  Having recently re-watched all six seasons on a classic TV station, I highly recommend the first five seasons for today's adults and their kids.  Season 6 had some real problems, after the growing emphasis on star Erik Estrada's machismo led to the season 5 departure of co-star Larry Wilcox.  Randi Oakes (Officer Bonnie Clark) also did not stick around for the final season, though Tina Gayle was an attractive if low-key replacement.
The 3rd season, however, was one of the best and with a number of youth-oriented stories, might be a worthwhile diversion even for today's kids.",1424044800,13,913,4.947712418300654

3657406,4,B001JAHPR6,"It is about time it comes out. I am really annoyed they take so long to come out onto DVD. These Shows that were in the 70's and early 80's should keep coming out. I mean SHOUT Company has to get Permission to bring out Hart to Hart and that takes 10 years to bring out Season 3. So if you are Fan of some of the Earlier shows then give comments. If you already have one and two then great that is cool because you liked the show. I have no idea about Season 3 it is not out yet but just the show rocks. So if you write a review great do not put VHS by it, Or blue Ray it is not like that just yet and we all know VHS is Not in Style but if you liked VHS i am all for it. So rock on to the Fans of the show or you are a collector rock on more.
If you are going to Review something then review for which item it is for, So it is a Dvd Write a Review For Dvd, Then if it is For Blue Ray then write about that and not dvd.",1421712000,3,919,3.5098039215686274

3657443,4,B001JAHPR6,"It's about time they released this 1979-80 Season of this police drama on DVD along with the fact that this was the season when Randi Oakes joins the cast as Officer Bonnie Clark replacing her predecessor Brianne Leary as Officer Sindy Cahill and Michael Dorn joins the cast as Officer Jeb Turner replacing Lew Saunders as Officer Gene Fritz.

This season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 7 years old in the 1st grade and used to watch it every Saturday night on NBC after HEE-HAW, but eventually this also became the season when CHiPs was moved to Sundays in the Spring of 1980.

This 1979-1980 Season also had some interesting guest stars like

Bill Daily who played Maj. Healey on  I DREAM OF JEANNIE in the ""Roller Disco""

Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes in the ""Off Road"" episode

James Luisi who played the hard-nosed Lt. Chapman on THE ROCKFORD FILES guest starring in ""The Strippers"" episode

John McCook who played Eric Forrester on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS & on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL guest starring in the"" Thrill Show""

Meredith Mac Rae from PETTICOAT JUNCTION guest starring in the ""Off Road"" episode

Granville Van Dusen in ""The Watch Commander"" episode before his co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and ONE LIFE TO LIVE

Michael Conrad from HILL STREET BLUES guest starring in the ""Drive Lady Drive"" episode

Anne Lockhart who played Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA guest starring in the "" Return of the Supercycle"" episode

Jared Martin from DALLAS in the ""Hot Wheels"" episode

Larry Linville who played Maj. Burns on M.A.S.H guest starring in ""Roller Disco"" episode

Dana Plato who played Kimberly Drummond guest starring in the ""Nightingale"" episode

Football player Jim Brown in the ""Roller Disco"" episode

Morgan Woodward from DALLAS guest starring in ""The Strippers"" episode

Singer Leif Garrett in the ""Roller Disco"" episode

So now that Warner Bros. is finally releasing its Junior year season of CHiPs out on DVD in the Spring of 2015, I can add it to my DVD collection of ADAM-12, DRAGNET, HUNTER, as well as my collection of the first2 seasons of CHiPs on top of that, plus I'll be able to watch these 1979-1980 Season episodes complete & uncut as well as commercial-free without all those deleted scenes you'd get in reruns on TNT, TBS, Me-TV, and H&I.",1415232000,7,2288,4.749367088607595

3657445,5,B001JAHPR6,"I wish that this product was put out two years ago I have had the first two seasons for about 3 years now and it is very frustrating to say it nicely, that they have taken so long to release it.
As I have many TV series on DVD by the same production company which produced Chips on DVD all great shows Magnum PI, The A team, Knight Rider all the seasons of all these show's including Most importantly the show that got me started collecting all the above mentioned show's, MIAMI VICE.
not to mention Rockford Files have all been released.
So what is the Hold up Chip's Warner Brothers!!!!???
I fear a very long backorder wait when they finally are released.
By the time WB and MGM finally release it.
People like myself who grew up watching the show will all be dead.

P.s, Facts of Life, Fame and Love Boat), and I absolutly hate it.

8312650,5,B001JAHPR6,"Yes, this show is cheesy but perhaps that's why it's so endearing. Have just started watching the first disc with the ""Roller Disco"" episode and boy, did that bring back memories. Leif Garrett! LOL. How he graced many of my 16 magazines back in the day. Well, we all know how he turned out later on in life...sad. But what really made me chuckle was the list of ""celebrities"" that showed up for the charity disco. Younger people today wouldn't know any of them at all. Jo Ann Pflug? Ruth Buzzi? Lee Meriwether? Robert Manden? And most of the cast from 8 is Enough,it looked like. Funny how fame is so fleeting. They could make a show like that with the ""stars"" of today and it will look just as silly as this does 30 years from now. Not to discredit actors but when I was watching them name names and caught a glimpse of each ""star"" I kinda laughed instead of feeling like ""Ohhhh....Cindy Williams! Wow!"" All ends well as we watch Leif lip synch to one of his ""hit songs"" before the record so obviously fades out. LOL!

And, naturally, we get to view Ponch disco dancing for a brief moment..macho cheesiness at it's best.

More giggles watching the dummies in cars right before it rolls over. And who knew that everyone back in the day drove cars that had huge dents on the sides and missing hubcaps? Yep, as soon as you see one you just know there will be a smash up. This is particularly side splitting in ""High Octane"" when the man who's driving the yellow station wagon learns that his car (which looks like it's on its last legs) blows up and he practically faints. He apparently thought he was driving a Porsche instead of an old wreck.

All I can say is....Take me to the freeway! I can't wait to watch more! Love it Love it Love it!!!",1508630400,,1742,4.3538461538461535
