8031019,5,B0002S647I,"A very funny film about Israel. You follow a chorus of the Israeli army in the year 1968. Among the songs of the film ""Shiru shir lashalom"" (Sing a song for peace) that was actually created in that very same chorus  and became later the anthem of pacifist movements in Israel!",1293321600,,276,4.411764705882353
8031020,5,B0002S647I,"I lived in Israel throught the 60's and 70's, so for me this was a delightful movie, filled with nostalgia about the country and the time. The music is excellent, the acting good, the characters very appealing. I don't know how people without this experience would view it, but for everyone in my family, it was a must-see.",1259280000,2,323,4.586206896551724
