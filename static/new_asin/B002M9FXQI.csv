8373685,5,B002M9FXQI,"As far as I see it, this document ""The Rolling Stones - In The 1960's"" is suited for educational purposes.",1317081600,,106,4.35
8373686,1,B002M9FXQI,"This 2 disc DVD set contains snippets of the early Stones.  No complete performances.  Any clip is shortened to 15 or 30 seconds then followed by endless interviews with people on the edge of the RS world at the time.  A complete waste of money.  For an excellent documentary of the Stones in late '69 to mid 70's purchase ""Stones in Exile"" instead. A much better DVD.",1305676800,6,368,4.447761194029851
8373687,5,B002M9FXQI,"Having been an avid 'Stones fan for the last 40 years, i've been collecting anything i can get my hands on and this DVD makes as an excellent addition to my ever expanding collection. With 2 DVD's packed with footage of the band, most of which i had not seen before, it tells the story from the inception through to the 70's. I've seen a few documentaries before but this one is the best so far as it contains so much information and tells their early story very well. It reminds you that they were once young boys writing great tunes and not the weathered rock behemoths they are today. A must-have for any self respecting Rolling Stones fan. Now the rest of the story please!!!!!",1288915200,10,681,4.412698412698413
