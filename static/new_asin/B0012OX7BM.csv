8247009,5,B0012OX7BM,this movie is awesome lots and lots of history I seen this on PBS I finally found this its worth your money,1368662400,,107,3.909090909090909
8247010,2,B0012OX7BM,This type of video is right down my alley however I had to give this one a low rating. Not because of the content - it was very interesting - but because of the video quality. I understand that in the '60s we did not have all the HD equipment available today however I feel the quality is bad even for that time period. I don't regret buying or watching the video but I also would not recommend it to anyone who is not very interested in the subject. Just saying this so you are aware of what you are getting before you lay out the cash.,1310428800,,537,4.02803738317757
8247011,1,B0012OX7BM,In answer to review by E. Rousey done in March 2010 I expanded picture of DVD package provided with SPACE RACE search response. I think both of us did our search on the title SPACE RACE THE UNTOLD STORY and were only given the package labeled SPACE RACE. If you expand the picture you will see that item from amazon search is actually 6 hours long. So it can not be the one from the year 2006 National Geograph TV (Part 1 and 2 shows) that with commercials were only 2 hours for each of the 2 parts. I bet a lot of space buffs like us were suckered by amazon into buying up a load of leftovers from a different production showing a documentary style of NASA story of American side of the  SPACE RACE. I think Amazon stinks when they pull these stunts when we both wanted the titled SPACE RACE:THE UNTOLD STORY which we put to the search engine and they ignore the full title to try and get people to buy the short title SPACE RACE dvd. I am still looking for the NAT GEO show (2006). Sorry.,1306972800,2,990,4.15625
8247012,5,B0012OX7BM,"Does anyone know if this is this the same ""Space Race"" that aired in 2006 on the National Geographic channel (which focuses on Werner Von Braun and Sergey Korolev)? I've been trying to find that for years, and if this is the same miniseries, I want it. But I can't tell from what little is included here.",1268265600,4,304,4.350877192982456
8247013,5,B0012OX7BM,"Fantastic, comprehensive and well researched, this is a great history lesson on NASA all wrapped up in in a few hours time.",1216166400,3,123,4.636363636363637
