5647759,5,B00BMQODJK,"We recently went to the circus so as soon as the Pocoyo's Circus DVD arrived in the mail Paige was jumping up and down with excitement. ""Pocoyo went to the circus just like ME!""

At four and five years old, my kids are still pretty self focused and the world revolves around them. So to see that one of their beloved characters did the same thing as them is enough reason for them to immediately demand to watch!

It was fun watching it with them and having them point out the similarities between the circus we saw and this alien space circus. For example, they recognized that all of the aliens coming out of the car were similar to the clowns coming out at the circus. They remembered the juggling and the different performance acts; although there were no aliens at our circus!

The white background and vibrant colors really make the focus on the characters and their story in Pocoyo and I like that there isn't a whole lot of distraction or unnecessary images to overload their minds. The narrator telling the entire story while the characters act it out is truly unique and I think it's part of what mesmerizes my kids. I can't think of anything else out there like that right now.

Most Pocoyo episodes are super short at under ten minutes so it was really fun for my kids to watch Pocoyo's Circus and get a longer look at their fun friends! The rest of the episodes are the regular length so you get the best of both worlds!",1377475200,,1433,4.416666666666667
5647760,5,B00BMQODJK,"Hi Everyone!
I just wanted to share about my family's experience with this month's NCircle Entertainment NSider movie ""Pocoyo's Circus"". This movie had the children (ages 8, 6, and almost 3) in constant giggles. I'm not even sure what was so funny as I couldn't keep my eyes off of the kids but it was a joy to hear them laughing away. My husband and I also found this movie to be refreshingly different than so many out there now days. It had a nice flow and was not over stimulating. The 80 minute movie kept our children captivated with the story and fun as they learned along with Pocoyo. Thank you!",1377388800,,603,4.392857142857143
5647761,5,B00BMQODJK,Once again pocoyo does not disappoint. My kids are 4 and 2 and both completely enjoy every pocoyo video we've purchased. They are truly hysterical above all else. The characters demonstrate so much emotion with few words while the narrator uses appropriate words to express what's happening. It's so simple and basic but really has great impact on my kids. My four year old is able to be more attentive to his brothers feelings based simply on his actions and can be thoughtful about what he might need. It's just effortless. And of course they both enjoy the pocoyo dance and teaching it to anyone who's interested!!!,1376784000,,618,4.785046728971962
5647762,5,B00BMQODJK,"My kids and I really enjoyed watching the ""Pocoyo's Circus"" DVD from NCircle that will be released on August 27. In the first episode, aliens recruit Pocoyo and his friends to perform in their space circus show. In ""Mystery Footprints"", Pocoyo examines different footprints and assumes Pato's flipper footprints are from a monster until he discovers the truth! In the next episode, Pocoyo's balloon floats away, but his friends aren't able to help him retrieve it. He is frustrated and angry until he realizes his friends are much more valuable to him. In ""Who's Calling Me Now"", Pocoyo discovers a box of various whistles that the friends use to call to each other, and the result is quite humorous. My kids thought this episode was especially hilarious! When Pocoyo puts off giving Baby Bird a driving lesson in ""Vamoosh on the Loose"", he decides to take off by himself and causes quite a commotion. In ""New on the Planet"" a shy little alien that ends up in Pocoyo's world is frightened of the characters that live there until he realizes they are afraid of him as well. ""Mad Mix Machine"" is about a contraption that allows Pocoyo to combine different objects to make one funny object like a trumpet that plays the radio, a train telephone, a bouncing bone and a cake hat. In ""Remember When"", the friends watch videos starring themselves and making fun of their friends, but Baby Bird and Caterpillar's video is the favorite because it showcases everyone. Pocoyo is a great show for kids because it encourages the development of problem solving skills and teaches lessons about friendship. Pocoyo is always eliciting giggles from my little guys! This is definitely a worthy addition to any Pocoyo fan's collection!",1376438400,,1716,4.88013698630137

5647775,5,B00BMQODJK,"Pocoyo Circus is just adorable. I found myself at age 32 laughing along with my 6 month old watching Pocoyo and all his friends. I cannot stress enough how wonderful all the Pocoyo DVDs are. The bright colors against the white background is visually stimulating, the message is not only positive but educational, and the joy of hearing your child laugh is priceless. This particular Pocoyo is 80 minutes long and full of pure educational entertainment the whole time. This DVD is expertly priced and does not break the bank. So sir back, relax, have some popcorn and spend time with your child watching Pocoyo Circus. Trust me you will enjoy it!!!!!!",1411257600,4,650,4.8125

Since it will most likely be watched in loops, your sanity won't take a toll with this movie!  I definitely recommend this DVD.",1406073600,,302,4.339285714285714
5647778,5,B00BMQODJK,"Both of my boys have loved Pocoyo since they first saw the show (both were about one year old when they first saw it). Now that they are 3 1/2 years old and 18 months, they still love it! Pocoyo and his friends are adorable, the adventures are fun, they are always learning something new, there is not constant repetition (like Dora, Diego, or any similar obnoxious kids show), and the episodes are actually fun for parents to watch as well. The characters are all unique and interesting and there is no yelling to get kids' attention, no annoying music, and no condescending questions or situations that seem to be typical of other kids shows. We highly recommend this sweet children's show!",1402358400,,692,4.680327868852459
5647779,5,B00BMQODJK,She loves Pocoyo.  I like the fact that she always picks up new vocabulary or phrases when she views a Pocoyo dvd.  This is important to me because she is delayed in her speech development.,1397260800,,189,4.371428571428571

Never heard of them before she became enamored with him.  As a former school teacher, I am happy to get these for our grands.  Happily, our kids do not use television as a babysitter, but there are times when it is necessary to have something to pop into the Tellie, or laptop that they are not worried for their little ones to watch.",1501891200,,456,4.392857142857143
