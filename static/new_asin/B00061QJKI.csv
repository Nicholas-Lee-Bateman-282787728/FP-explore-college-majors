2156866,4,B00061QJKI,"When St. Paul was in Athens, he noted all the temples to the different gods; even one to 'The Unknown God.""  When he began to speak to the people, he noted how religious they were and then continued by saying that he came to proclaim the unknown God they worshiped without knowing Him.  [See Acts 17:23.]  The point is that he acknowledged the way the people were, and addressed them in terms they could understand.  While Sister Helen's manner might seem rough to many people, she also recognized the men as they were and spoke to them in terms with which they were familiar.  It is important to understand this concept because it is the key to Sister Helen's success in working with down and out men.

When I was in college in New York, I had a friend who came from the South Bronx (who was in school on scholarship).  After I went with him to visit his family one weekend, I can say from firsthand experience that Sister Helen had to have been Divinely chosen to work with drunks and junkies like I saw all around my friend's house.  I stuck very close to my friend when we passed by vomit-stained junkies!  It would take a very special person to understand how to love men that would cause fear or apprehension in most middle-class people.  Therefore, I suggest that this movie be watched with this in mind, not by the standards of middle class, churchgoing America.  You don't need to be 'called' to work with such people, nor feel guilty because you emotionally couldn't work with them. We are taught that we shouldn't love people because they are Christian, but because we are!

The best way for most people to watch this movie is to view it as a wonderful example of how God uses different kinds of people who are ideally suited for the different ministries to which they are called.  Sister Helen probably would be just as out of place in your pastor's place as he would be in hers!  Yet, one can appreciate the efforts of both in their calling to fulfil their Lord's ministry to people.",1206403200,3,1996,4.4779005524861875
2156867,5,B00061QJKI,"""Sister Helen"" is a superb documentary about a rigid, intolerant, foul mouthed, bitter, oblate (civilian) nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south Bronx.  All but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks/addicts. Robert, the only middle class representative - he had a real job, house, and even a BMW - regrets she died before he could tell her off. Why?

Robert, like six of the residents, was on parole. He complained that Helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow-tow to her.  In an ""extras"" interview he said Helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life - her husband and her two boys. The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55. One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15. Helen was left with one daughter, who she abandoned to run the center.  The daughter was not pleased. She wanted her mom.

What's fascinating is how little Helen changed. Outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change. But after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times -- once with the directors narrating -- it became clear that Helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males.

Helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars. But her bossiness, intolerance, and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age 56. Living with her must have been extremely difficult. Even Robert says he stayed clean in spite of Helen.

The film opens with Helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter. Supposedly she is showing off her street savvy. Another time she publicly demeans Mel, her ""assistant"" for not bathing for a  year. Then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air.  The film is viscous with Helen threatening and demeaning people.  Her signature song is ""My Way."" Her favorite phrase is, ""I'm going to be totally honest with you.""  Often, people who use such phrases, turn out o be the opposite.

The residents are really down and out. Only Robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom. They all desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, since she runs the place on her own, has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases.  She has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding. It is her show.

Helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety. She stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too.  She blames substance abuse on the drug or booze, and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug.  She's no therapist; just a landlady who dyes her hair, wears a habit, and has wields complete power over her tenants.
Helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine (ureen she calls it) tests on requests.  Twice Major, a very solid and respected long term older resident -- who she trusted -- failed his tests. Helen was furious and evicted him. Major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin.  Helen didn't yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made. This was especially troubling since she knew Major for a long time. Yet she discounted her relationship with him, assumed he was a liar, and relied completely on the results.  Major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate.  Helen never apologized publicly, but supposedly made up with major privately.

Helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood.  She tacitly admitted to Robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's tires. The person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his/her tires slashed.

She was not a nice woman.  So eventually, she decided the only way to keep the Travis name (her last name) alive - since the three male Travises died - was to start the Travis Center.
For some of the residents it was a great deal. They complied with Helen and in exchange received a cheap, safe, sober, and structured place to live. One however, said he preferred jail.

Addicts and drunks don't all need to be treated like children. Helen employed ""old school"" techniques which have been discredited.  However, no one was forced to remain at the center and for some, it was definitely a positive experience.  The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives.

2156868,3,B00061QJKI,"My SO grabbed this for me one night when we picked out movies for each other and considering my love for nuns and documentaries it was quite a good choice! Sister Helen was a nun living in the Bronx who ran a house to help recovering drug abusers. The film is a bit of biography about her life as an alcoholic, a mother, who turns into a tough loving nun as well as a story of a Catholic outreach program. Unfortunately, the DVD we picked up from the library was so scratched up it became a bit exasperating to watch the film but it is an intriguing documentary if you get the chance.",1180915200,,584,4.176991150442478
2156869,1,B00061QJKI,"This is a disgusting ""documentary"". I was shocked and scandalized to see a woman consecrated to God using foul language and yelling obscentities. Also,I was amazed to see that the relationship between ""Sister Helen"" and the patients were almost a boyfriend/girlfriend type of relationship. They definitely did not have the normal relationship that sister has with those she is serving. I hated this documentary because it portrays religious sisters in such a poor light. I personally know Catholic sisters and I have NEVER EVER known one who would, or could(without being disciplined by superiors) behave in such a fould unmannerly way. There are many fine sisters who do amazing good work for society and the world at large. I think this film was designed to make them look bad, and I think it suceeded. While its true that not all religious are saints, it is also true that I have never met one that acted like she worked in a bar either. I only hope that anyone who watches this horrible film will also watch Malcolm Muggeridges ""Something Beautiful For God"". I think there is also a wonderful documentary called ""Mother Teresa"". I think the filmmakers definitely had an agenda in making this film, and I wonder that it was made since surely Sister's superiors would recognize how bad it would make them look. I do not recommend this trash to anyone.",1176422400,3,1353,4.836206896551724

Yes, she was rough and raw, but her belief that ""the parties over"" said it all. Maybe A.A. is a softer gentler way, but Sister Helen provided sick unfortunates a place to stay and one on one guidance. You  won't get that at any A.A. fellowship.

2156871,3,B00061QJKI,"...but I don't.

It's clear that Sister Helen helped some people and that the clients we met in the film loved her.

However, as a recovering alcoholic who believes in AA, I was repelled by the anger, the screaming, and her use of guilt as a motivator.  Even if the editing was unkind, she apparently subscribed to the school of browbeating and sarcasm--I don't.

I didn't see a woman I, personally, could like or support.",1152921600,6,422,4.586666666666667
2156872,5,B00061QJKI,"Sister Helen (2002) won critical attention at Sundance for its fiery title protagonist, Sister Helen Travis, a sixty-nine year old Benedictine nun, who runs a transitional home for men seeking to stay clean and sober. Rebecca Camissa and Rob Fruchtman's documentary manages to capture in considerable detail the difficulties of running a facility for men who battle their demons.

What makes this documentary exceptional is that the founder, Sister Helen, has her own past with which she has to contend making her more than a `savior', but a fellow traveler who understands the trials the men face. Having lost her husband and two sons to the atrocities of drugs, alcohol, and in one case, murder, we can sympathize with Sister Helen's passion to assist others.

Her no-nonsense style will provoke viewers who believe that members of religious orders should avoid profanity, speak prettily, and invoke God in a particular pious way. Sister Helen reflects the world from which she came: hard-bitten, tough, and demanding. Her tough-love approach guides the men who would have her believe the various lies they tell from time to time but she remains committed to them no matter how often they falter.

Individuals who prefer their religious types similar to the folks in Sister Act and The Sound of Music would do well to avoid Sister Helen.",1149465600,11,1339,5.049773755656108
2156873,5,B00061QJKI,I loved this movie because I came to love the 'hard as nails' but 'full of heart' Sister Helen. This film will shock some more traditional religious people but it is so honest. Those of us who have only a limited understanding of the power of addiction come to respect this totally dedicated woman.

As much as I laugh my friends' ""mean old nuns"" stories, I have problems relating to their' tales of getting smacked on their heads with a wooden ruler, or writing Bible verses from memory on the chalkboard. ""Sister Helen"" is takes a slightly skewed look at the life of a parish nun, with all of the hilarity and tumultuous moments on display. One takeaway for me was that how a nun's life can be totally devoted to worship, prayers and singing God's praises one minute, then get into a fierce argument with another nun when she's caught kissing a man. That part was strange, I  admit. I thought nuns are supposed to be celibate once they take their vows. Oh, well. Nuns need love and affection, too!",1494374400,,846,4.4935064935064934

A recovered alcoholic, with a tragic past Sister Helen opened a half way house in on of the most notoriously dangerous places in the US - the South Bronx. The sober living facility she founded catered only to men. All of them long time drug addicts and many hardened criminals with violent history's and  long prison records.

She nurtures them, she takes no prisoners and these tough as nails men quiver in her presence. It's simply a remarkable portray of one woman's journey from devastating tragedy to a life devoted to helping others in a style and fashion that's anything but polite and delicate.

We often think of angels as ethereal beings, delicate, beautiful and forever peaceful - the essence of light and purity.

However, this film is case in point that sometimes the most beautiful angel can appear - and did appear in the guise of a loud, crass, often foul mouthed Nun.

Not to be missed, Sister Helen is a character of unrivaled eccentricities, a survivor and a saver of lives.",1340582400,,1119,4.742268041237113
2156937,5,B00061QJKI,"Sister Helen was exactly as she was portrayed: a tough minded, street smart woman who had been around the block a few times and back. At age 56 she joined the Benedictine order after losing her alcoholic husband to a heart attack, one son to a heroine overdose and the other to a stabbing. An acolholic herself, she decided to become sober and grab a second chance. She wanted to help others the way she wished she had helped her sons.

Sister Helen looked after twenty something men at Travis House, which she ran with an iron fist. These men were not only addicts but some had also committed serious offenses. Sister Helen's language was salty, but she knew it was language they understood, because she had been there herself. And she desperately wanted them to understand that this was their chance. So no conning, no blaming, no excuses were allowed. Obey the rules or you are out.

And the rules were pretty simple. Stay clean, pay rent, help out, no women in the house and maintain curfew. If you couldn't ( or wouldn't ) follow the rules, then you were back on the streets and someone else who wanted a chance took your place.

It was pretty clear that many of the men had a love/hate relationship with this abrasive woman much as a teen might have with a parent who has laid down the law. Tough love isn't always appreciated until much later when you can view your life in perspective. But many of the men stayed and worked on their sobreity because deep down, they knew this may be their last chance.

At age 56, Sister Helen brought who she was to the ministry, the sum total of her life's experiences. She didn't suddenly transform into a meek and pious woman because she put on a veil. She understood the language and psychology of the addict because she had been one, so she was able to connect with them. You can't con a con artist, as is said,  and all addicts, at some point, are that. Including Sister Helen.
.
God's work is done in many ways using many methods. It's not a cookie cutter experience and shouldn't be. Giving a life back in Travis House is no less valuable because the approach doesn't fit our sensibilities of how a "" proper nun"" should act.

Fortunately, Sister Helen understood that.",1293408000,5,2218,4.491315136476427
2156938,5,B00061QJKI,"Sister Helen is a superb, insightful documentary partly about Helen Travis, who at 56 became a nun. Two years later, Sister Helen opened a transitional home for men who were addicted to drugs or alcohol. Sister Helen has her personal reasons for trying to help these down and out men: her life had already been very rough. Indeed, Helen Travis had endured more than most of us could ever bear. She lost her husband to alcoholism; one of her sons died of a drug overdose and another son was stabbed seventeen times at the tender age of fifteen.

In order to have empathy for Helen, you need to keep in mind that she came from a tough as nails, rough background. Sister Helen may have been wearing a nun's habit; but yes, she DID keep her own ways. She was very foul-mouthed; and she DID use her power to boss around the men who lived in her transitional home. This is going to cause great controversy because there are some of us who believe that nuns should not swear and refer to urine as some other four letter word which I will not repeat here.

On the other hand, I saw Sister Helen doing a lot of good for the residents of her home. Let's face it: these were people whose lives had been destroyed by their overpowering addictions to drugs and alcohol. This is often precisely the type of person who needs a tough mentor to lead them away from drugs and alcohol and back toward a life of sobriety. I should know: as the son of an alcoholic, drug addicted mother, I will never forget how hard it was just to get my mother to go to a single A.A. meeting--just once. After many years my mother had to eventually hit rock bottom and only then she began a recovery that was never fully completed.

In this film, look for Helen to essentially give tons of tough love to the men in her home in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City. These men have tried so many times and often failed to stay clean of drugs. What was Helen to do? As you will see in this film, Sister Helen possesses an uncanny ability to see through the lies they tell her when in fact they have abused drugs behind her back. She wisely calls for ""emergency meetings"" when one member may have to be kicked out--for the fifth time.

Upon close examination, however, you'll see the love she does have for these men. She actually gives a fifth chance to the man who suffers from alcoholism; and she actually tells the men in another group meeting that she loves them dearly. She even goes completely off the deep end with her own grief and anger when a false positive drug report comes back that Major, one of her favorite residents, abused a drug. As it turns out, he was taking a prescription drug containing codeine which caused a false positive for opiate use. Sister Helen really should have publicly apologized to the man named Major; but she's human too and I guess she either couldn't muster it or she apologized privately when the cameras weren't rolling.

There are extras that are equally interesting. Look for some extra interviews with several residents of the home; and there is some great commentary for you to choose if you wish.

Overall, not everyone will like this documentary. If you are easily offended by four letter words, you should skip this one. If you can handle or even prefer to see tough love then you will enjoy this film.

8036446,5,B00061QJKI,"Sister Helen is one of those documentaries that will stick with me for a while. She was such an amazing woman, truly the sort of nun most deserving of a spot in heaven. Sister Helen didn't mince words, she didn't watch her language, and she definitely didn't take any cr@p from anyone! Still, in her tough as nails, bulldog way, she loved the people helped.",1515888000,,357,4.507692307692308

An unforgettable woman of valor. Thank you to the men in the film who allowed their story to be told.",1514419200,,270,4.42

8036449,3,B00061QJKI,"Quite interesting but sad to watch the Sister act out her own unresolved stuff on the men who were in her care. The shaming blaming sarcasm and guilt inducing reminded me of abusive parents who use their children for there own needs. The degrees of emotionl emeshment and entanglement we see here are not healthy at all. In order to care for people you cannot be using them like this, acting like a mother who plays the part of a wounded marter if one of her favorites should slip back in some way. She could pretty much emotionally treat the men any way she wanted since old school thinking says addicts are bad or morally bankrupt. Most recent research and more and more treatment models say that shaming and blaming do not work, and in fact contribute to the cycle of continued addiction. Science tells us there are actual physical changes in the addicts brains. This sort of shaking your head and saying ""why did you drink again?"" is not treatment. Of course the sister is acting out a lot of stuff regarding her son's who died. And she seems to need to have a lot of attention focused on her and her emotional state. I watched as her routine of sarcasm etc was used on one applicant and he sat there crying. Nobody seemed to think this mattered. I suppose because he was a poor man who was an addict right?",1511740800,,1311,4.421487603305785

8036454,5,B00061QJKI,This is the reason why I love documentaries...im always learning something new. Sister Helen was a dynamo....she went toe to toe without fear....but with love and concern for genuinely helping these cast aways have better lives.
