390547,2,6301967437,"The mistake isn't this film, but the decision that led to it. In early 1965, Roy Orbison left Monument Records - where he had his biggest success - for MGM Records, partly so he could try his hand at movies. His recording career promptly skidded downhill (at least in the US), and this silly Western comedy was the only film he completed; he's adequate enough, but when he's not singing he seems bland and colorless. Still, if you're a big Roy Orbison fan, or a fan of this kind of movie, this tape is for you.",1013904000,11,510,4.322916666666667
390548,4,6301967437,"If you like Roy or his music,which you should,this is your movie. Campy as all get out but weren't they all at this period. Better then any beach movie this because the music isn't teeny bopper. Learn it,Love it,Live it.",973900800,8,220,4.525
390549,5,6301967437,"No surfboards.  NO BMX bikes.  No Kurt Russell. Yet somehow the bullet-shooting guitar makes up for the wicked mess.  Dude, i want a guitar that shoots bullets.  I found a mistake, though.  I know a person who plays  the guitar much faster.  My friend, Crazy Evan Jones, hits a wicked fresh  maximum thrust of 600 spm (strums per minute).  We clocked it, yo.  It's  all official.  We should rename this movie ""One of the fastest  guitar's that isn't alive, but is fast nonetheless, dude!""  If you  like this movie, i recommend ""Endless Summer"", ""Rad"",  ""The Fastest Trumpet in Toledo"", ""The Slowest Marraca Shaker  Alive"", and ""The Best Bassist in Critial Condition"".  These  are all real movies, although they don't rock as hard as THIS one.  You  don't even know.  Hey Drew, if a cow dies in the forest, who will light the  grill?",947462400,11,832,4.664335664335664

The movie is pretentious enough.  Roy and friends are trying to get money for the Confederate war chest, they get found out, they run etc etc.  Never mind the movie, just get it if you're an Orbison fan.",1353369600,,460,4.010989010989011

7818318,1,6301967437,"What's the point of making a Roy Orbison film if he cannot wear his trademark shades? The legendary singer plays a guitar-wielding Confederate spy in this low-budget clunker from B-movie maestro Sam Katzman. Poor Roy looks lost in his only starring role - weighed down by a terrible soundtrack and Katzman's shoddy production values. Originally intended for Elvis Presley (who wisely turned it down), ""The Fastest Guitar Alive"" is bad enough to kill any rock icon's film career.",1256169600,,478,5.141025641025641
7818319,3,6301967437,"The Fastest Guitar Alive! (1967) Okay, if someone told you there was a movie starring Roy Orbison as a Confederate spy in the Civil War who carries a guitar that is also a gun, would you believe it? Well friends and neighbors, there is such a movie, and I have seen it! Roy plays Johnny, teamed with Steve (Sammy Jackson) as spies out to steal some northern gold for the Confederate war chest. Their cover is a traveling medicine show, with several dancing girls along as added camouflage. All are aware of their real mission however, including Johnny's girlfriend Sue (Joan Freeman). Johnny is the minstrel of the group, strumming his six string and singing several songs throughout the flick until trouble looms. Then he pushes the special hidden button, the guitar grows a rifle barrel, and he commences to shootin!' I kid you not! Despite this deadly prop, no one gets killed, there's a lot of goofy humor, and of course Roy is singing every few minutes, making this movie very much a cross between a Disney movie like The Apple Dumpling Gang and a late 60's Elvis movie. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this was originally written as an Elvis vehicle. If true, Elvis obviously turned it down, leaving the door wide open for The Big O to step into the star shoes. As an actor, Roy makes one heck of a great singer, but it's fun to see him trying, and the music is a big compensation as I always enjoy hearing Roy sing. Movie girlfriend Freeman was an interesting choice as she had previously spent time with Mr. Presley in Roustabout, and horror movie fans will recognize her as Mrs. Jarvis from Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter! None of the other actors are well known, but they are all at least adequate, the color photography features some beautiful landscapes, and the script manages to sidestep the fact that our heroes are on the Confederate side rather neatly without cheating too much. All in all this one is well worth a look for Orbison fans or those who enjoy some novelty value in their movies. Check it out!",1229040000,4,2030,4.579670329670329

 It's not the best movie you'll ever watch but if you are down in the dumps this will certainly make you laugh.
 The music by Roy makes up for a simple story plot  and Hey ! After all it is Roy Orbison....
 I say Get it...Enjoy... You'll be glad you bought it !
 Roy's  two biggest fans...Lois ( The Mommy) and 10 year old son Cory",1059523200,13,469,3.8229166666666665
