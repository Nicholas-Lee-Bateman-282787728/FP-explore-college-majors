I didn't know that they had made a second and third movie, after watching I can see why. It does have some OK explosions. If your a Don ""the dragon"" Wilson fan, you might like, if not, save your money",1254009600,3,371,4.314285714285714
1026092,5,6305382441,"Take a fabulous trip to the mystic isles of Indonesia with the Blair Brothers. This DVD is for the person seeking adventure in finding unique places and people. The material goes deep inside many of the 300+ ethnic groups that make up the nation of Indonesia. This is no light-hearted travelogue.

1026093,3,6305382441,"Ring of Fire is more of a love story than a martial arts film, set in the cheesiest tradition of Romeo & Juliet.  In L.A., the Chineese and Americans are constantly at each other's throats, fighitng both in and out of the ring.  Don Wilson plays a doctor (Johnny) with martial arts skills, romancing the Maria Ford character (Julie), whose brother Brad (played by Dale Jacoby: Bloodmatch, No Retreat No Surrender) is obsessed with getting in the ring with Johhny's cousin - Terry (played by Steven Vincent Leigh: Deadly Bet, To Be The Best).  Eventually, the 2 show off in a literal ring of fire, a short but good fight in the movie, fighting Thai style with broken glass (seen also in Kickboxer's 1 & 2).  There is not a whole lot of fighting in the movie, but most of the fights are pretty good.  Most of the move time is devoted to the building relationship between Johnny and Julie.  Unfortunately, Don Wilson only has one fight in the movie, at the end.  Other decent martial art stars featured in the film are Eric Lee and Vince Murdocco (Kickboxer 2, To Be The Best).  One of the best lines of all time comes from this movie.  Hands down to ""I have some of Bruce Lee's favotie drink - WAAATAAAAH!

Overall, Ring of Fire is an average martial arts movie that throws in a decent love story, though very cheesy.  There isn't a whole lot of action, but if you enjoy these on screen actors (for their skills of course), you will enjoy Ring of Fire.  It is the best one in the trilogy.",1155859200,,1486,4.402930402930403
1026094,4,6305382441,"This is defenitely one of Don's best films that he has made in his earlier days. From watching this film I have started to watch other movies from his co-stars because I have considered them to be good martial artists also. The other actors are: Steven Vincent Leigh, Vince Murdocco, Dale Jacoby, Eric Lee,  Ron Winston Yuan and Gary Daniels. This movie has good fight scenes with descent high kicks and good chereography involved. The movie is about Johnny an asian-american (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson), who has fallen in love with an american girl. The complications of the story arise when racial hatred surrounds their newfound relationship caused by the girls brother Brad (Dale Jacoby) and boyfriend Chuck (Vince Murdocco)who are both racial against asians. Brad challenges Johnnys brother who is also asian-american (Steven Vincent Leigh) to a no holds barred streetfight where Brad shows no mercy after overpowering Johnnys brother and kills him. Johnny is challenged next and is faced with a streak of vengeance for his brother death.",1131321600,3,1041,5.123529411764705
1026095,4,6305382441,"Don ""the dragon "" Wilson is a kick boxing legend. Winning 10 different world championships and proving his dragon style kung-fu was affective in the ring. Ring of Fire is one of my favorites. The plot is very well put together unlike some of Don's other films. Don only had one fight scene lasting a maximum 7 minutes. It has some great fights between what I like to call, ""the asians"" and the "" white boys"", Ring of Fire is a prety good martial arts/kick boxing film that gives you a action packed time!",1057622400,,504,4.372340425531915
1026096,3,6305382441,"The previous reviewer mistakenly wrote a review of a martial arts movie with the same name...Ring of Fire.  This video however, is a documentary regarding the volcanoes and earthquakes around the Pacific Rim and the Hawaiian Islands.  The video is very well done, as most of it was taken from an IMAX movie theater presentation.  It has many great shots of lava streams, erruptions, and other related scenes -- such as the earthquake damage in San Franciso as the result of the 1989 earthquake.  Overall it is well done and a nice documentary, but a bit pricey for only 40 minutes of video.",1009411200,9,590,4.699029126213592

1026098,4,6305382441,"Probably Dons best movie, with beautiful training scenes, better than rocky and hard hitting action scenes. The acting isn't horrible and the story carries well. This movie has lots of fight scenes with creative  twists (Don takes on a gang of martial artists that wear glass on their  fists.) the bad guy hammers nails into wood with his palms. I don't see why  more of his movies arn't like this one.",960681600,,402,4.633802816901408
1026099,3,6305382441,This is one of the very few movies of dons that I like. It shows great fight scenes keeps the action pumping has good dialouge and the training sequnces really stick with you! It shows the true athletisism af the  masters because dispite his performance in his other movies don is a  phenominal fighter. this movie gives his name some meaning.,960595200,,343,4.60655737704918

7889150,4,6305382441,"I remember seeing this back in 1991 on video. Just like so many other people I searched for this on DVD. Pretty good movie, but not really an action movie, it was more driven by the plot (Romeo & Juliet). Anyways about the dvds. I own both versions. This version shown in the picture is the edited one, that had the nudity cut. The complete one has a slighty different cover. I would recommend either one because overall it was a good movie.",1262044800,,441,4.325301204819277
7889151,4,6305382441,"While PM Entertainment - that glorious company of action and excess - had already made action movies featuring martial arts, ""Ring of Fire"" is the studio's first genuine karate flick, as well as a triumph for martial arts of the B-movie scale. It's also a pretty unique vehicle for star Don Wilson - possibly one of his best, which is ironic given his limited input to the action content. As a genuinely exciting kickfest that's powered by a real plot and investable characters, I deem this a must-have for fans of low budget action and just about all of the performers involved.

The story: In the middle of a violent gang rivalry in Los Angeles, a doctor and cousin of the Asian gang's leader (Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;series) falls in love with the sister and fianc&eacute; of the Surfer gang's leaders (Maria Ford,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-of-Destruction/dp/B0001KNHLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel of Destruction</a>).

I believe this is the perfect role for Don Wilson, who I find enjoyable though not for the quality of his other movies. In an all-time low count for a feature advertised with his name, Wilson has only a single fight - the finale - and spends the rest of the film interacting with others in a dramatic way, opposed to a physical manner. Don is naturally likable and gives a smooth performance, all the while acting well with costar Maria Ford. Ford's acting ability is often underrated in favor of her sexuality, but here it is clearly at the forefront of her performance. Together, she and Wilson make a sound dramatic duo and a believable couple.

Thematically, the movie may not be particularly strong, but I say that it's as significant as the viewer allows for. It's obvious that this is a take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-and-Juliet/dp/1505259568/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo and Juliet</a>&nbsp;with kickboxing, but it's also one of only a handful of films at the time that addressed interracial romance from an Asian perspective. Race relations would be a non-factor in most of Wilson's films to come, so it's all the more significant that he sets such a positive standard for a masculine Asian-American who perseveres for the sake of love. I haven't seen many western films wherein an Asian male is portrayed as desirable and romantic; Wilson makes the absolute most of the opportunity to be both, and delivers one of the best performances of his career.

The action content is both ample and solid, with approximately eight full-length matches providing a good stage for a supergroup of film fighters: Steven Vincent Leigh, Dale Jacoby, Vince Murdocco, Eric Lee, Gary Daniels, Ron Yuan... (And those are only the performers with additional acting scenes.) Admittedly, many of the matches are a bit too heavily edited for my taste, but the occasional creativeness of the choreography and the consistent athleticism of its performers shine through, making for a cumulatively enjoyable adrenaline package. Even the final showdown featuring Wilson (and even more editing) can be considered among Don's personal best, making it worth waiting for.

The film bounces along with an agreeable pace and hums with a level of energy that PM would frequently try to recapture and often fail at. It's enjoyable, and despite its imperfections, that is the most I can ask of a movie. If you know this is your kind of picture, I encourage you to check it out.",1260230400,2,3623,5.497307001795332
