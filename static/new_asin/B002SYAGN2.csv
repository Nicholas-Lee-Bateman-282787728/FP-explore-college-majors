3982815,3,B002SYAGN2,"People Magazine gave this a 1/2 star out of 5. It truly wasn't that bad.

Here are my thoughts.

Sandra Bullock's character is awkward and that is an understatement. This still-at-home-with-mom-and-dad crossword-puzzle-creator is an unique blend of Cliff Clavin (Cheers) Napoleon Dynamite and Pippi Longstocking. I struggled with whether to like Mary and cheer her on or to just be annoyed and laugh at her when she fell into the big hole. I ended up doing both.

Basic plot: Mary, due to outside pressures, thinks she needs to take her one last shot of normalcy by embracing (understatement) a blind date. When he comes to pick her up and turns out to be ""hot"" she does this creepy silent stare thing and runs back upstairs to put some sexy on. A truly awkward scene follows when she jumps Steve (Bradley Cooper), not after an okay date but before they even pull away from her folks' house. At first Steve is dazzled by the skin and enthusiasm but then he begins to think she might be crazy so he invents an excuse...a phone call sending him away. While he's attempting to get her out of the van before she truly goes crazy he mentions wishing she could go with him. More circumstances make that a possibility. Some may call it stalking, Mary calls it many, many other things in long paragraphs and polysyllabic words.

Mary is not just a person who talks all the time -- she's a walking encyclopedia of random facts -- and she ends up alienating loads of people on her quest to find Steve. Then she becomes a hero, accidentally, of course. Thomas Haden Church plays the annoying, selfish anchorman wanna-be and he eggs Mary on. Though I wasn't sure what his motivation was exactly his encouragement got Mary to relentlessly pursue Steve. Most of the characters are oddly eccentric, almost cartoonish, from Mary's parents to Haden Church's nemesis. It was almost as if the movie was an attempt to tell a quirky feel good story blended with a parody. It's one of the stranger films I've seen.

Content warnings. The groping scene in the beginning 20 minutes of so of the movie goes on too long and it should be screened before child/young teen viewing. That probably won't be an issue though since most children will likely get bored. Several sexual references are scattered throughout the film. One news story that Steve chases down involves a fight over amputating a baby girl's third leg and there are a few obvious body part innuendo/references. Some language. Some skin, mostly cleavage.

There are several amusing one-liners and descriptives and a  pretty sweet tornado besides some great physical comedy and pratfalls. A few scenes are laugh-out-loud funny. Many, many more are shake-the-head shrug inspiring. I'll give it a 3 and I'll probably watch it again when it hits DVD, if for no other reason, to see if I understand it a little better. Maybe it will have that Napoleon Dynamite magic. I didn't like it the first time I watched it either.",1253923200,56,2953,4.744639376218323
3982816,5,B002SYAGN2,"All About Steve stars Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper (from The Hangover). I'm not a fan of Sandra's movies, but this one i found hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud to this. I'm going to probably buy this when it comes to DVD. Recommended.",1253404800,2,250,4.5777777777777775
3982817,5,B002SYAGN2,I thought this movie was GREAT!  I watch all of Sandra Bullock's movies and I think she played this character GREAT! Even down to the eye makeup!  So what if you think the story line is weak and unbelievable!  Most movies are! When I go to a movie I don't go to see REAL LIFE. If I wanted that I would stay at home and watch CNN or FOX news. Movies for me are Romance movies and they are for Dreaming and Comedy movies for a GOOD laugh!  If you are looking for a GOOD healthy laugh then go watch this movie.  I laughed and cried at this movie because I know there ARE people out there like this that society makes fun of! I'm going to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD thats how much I enjoyed it! This is just my opinion.,1252886400,64,728,3.925170068027211
3982818,1,B002SYAGN2,"The previous reviewer was too kind to this movie.  Mary is not super intelligent, she has remembered a lot of trivial information but is a dysfunctional human.  She has no ability to apply her trivial knowledge other then to dazzle all the moronic characters in the movie.  The story line is not ""somewhat weak and unbelievable;"" it is 100% weak and unbelievable.  I am exceedingly tolerant of mindless chick flick fair when it attempts to entertain and a few good laughs can be had, but this one is just plain stupid and annoying.  Bullock is way over the top and seems to be trying way too hard to salvage it in an embarrassingly progressive way.  I will not commit any more words or time to this movie.  Save yourself and skip this poorly conceived POS.",1252281600,13,756,4.555555555555555
3982819,3,B002SYAGN2,"So the critics gave this movie a really bad review that made me scared to go and see this film. However, I am a fan of Bradley Cooper and Sandra Bullock and so decided to give it a try.

Bullock plays Mary, a super intelligent nerdy lady who writes crossword puzzles for a living and goes on a blind date with Cooper's Steve. The date ends abruptly with a lie from Steve and a series of events leads Mary to believe she should follow Steve where-ever he goes because he loves her.

The storyline is somewhat weak and unbelievable. However, the film is saved by Bradley Cooper and his baby-blues. Never before have I gone to a film just to support the actor, but I love Cooper, he is more than just a pretty face and shows that he has great acting skills as well.

The end of the movie seems like it is trying to teach a life lesson that though I agreed with didn't think fit with the tone with the movie.

This isn't the best chick flick film that I've seen and didn't have the obligatory happy-ending that most of us are used to, but it did have me laughing more than a couple of times and is worth a view. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could.",1252108800,4,1141,4.103139013452915

3982825,2,B002SYAGN2,"I knew this movie had earned Sandra Bullock a Razzie, which in an odd way made me even more curious about it since its no secret shes a great actress.  But not even she could save such a mediocre plot.  Hers was the only developed character in the entire movie.  She supposedly wins the hearts and minds of several people but how and why she managed to do so isn't that clear.  And **very small spoiler alert** the fact that the main antagonist was allowed to take credit for her heroics at the end just ticked me off.  Im not a huge feminist and would have been okay if it had added any real value to the story.  But it didnt.  In fact I think it took away from the story and robbed viewers of what would have been a small reward for sitting through the entire movie.",1509840000,2,768,4.148648648648648

3982851,3,B002SYAGN2,"All About Steve

 Sandra Bullock stars in All About Steve.  This is her second outing this year, after the mega hit but frankly mediocre The Proposal.  All I can say is that Bullock is such a fine comic actress that it doesnt really matter if she appears in flawed, absurd or forced films.  We love her; she is Americas Sweetheart with bells on.
 Bullock plays a loveless careerist  of an age where romance and marriage need to come before all else or such will never happen.  For a long while the viewer is given to believe that her character is loony, round the bend-in short, nuts.  She fixates on a hapless Bradley Cooper, a handsome TV cameraman as the solution to her romantic problems.  Hilarity ensues, or if not hilarity, at least the occasional smile and one good belly laugh.
 Writer Kim Backer in only her second major league outing presents us with a lot of snappy dialog, and a lot of monologue by Bullock who speaks to at hamster and a deaf child-and gushes words at inappropriate times like the hot water tap with a busted washer when you are already late for work.  We find that Bullocks character isn't loony tunes after all.  She is just a smart girl with red boots.
 Backer leaves us to ponder Words can matter, they can be irrelevant or they can hurt.  We could all do well to remember that.
 The deft writing and the excellent always shining star of Sandra Bullock save a potentially preposterous script from spinning apart.  Nice supporting efforts from Thomas Haden Church as a narcissistic newsy and Ken Jeong as the harried producer.
 This narrowly three saw blade chick flick is rated PG13.  It brought in a mid range $13 million in three days.  Btw-Bullock plays romantically against an actor 11 years her junior.  You go girl.",1471564800,,1755,4.596774193548387

I watched a few minutes, left to have a snack and came back to give it another shot, then turned it off in disgust. I absolutely could not handle the Sandra Bullock character's need to talk to herself, or to others every minute of the day. The behavior was annoying in the extreme!

3982946,4,B002SYAGN2,"Delightful. With all the many films about awkward men chasing socially savvy women, it's about time we saw the reverse play out. Mary is clearly on the autism spectrum--I should know, as I'm the author of the best-selling book Aspergirls--and though we've seen many serious films about asperger women, this is the first romantic comedy i've seen with an aspergirl protagonist.
Temple Grandin, Dragon Tattoo, Smilla's sense of snow are great films but we all need to laugh and to laugh at ourselves. Sandra Bullock did a sensational job playing the highly intelligent, yet guileless, naive, trusting yet ingenious Mary. I thought all the supporting players were great too. Like all rom coms, it's a bit corny here and there but that comes with the territory. The final result was very satisfactory and I'm glad it ended the way it did and not the way it might have.",1408406400,2,864,4.844594594594595
3982947,3,B002SYAGN2,"I would probably give this a 3 1/2 stars.  I have watched this movie twice.  The first time I focused on Sandra Bullock and did not care about her crazy character or the movie.  About a year later I watched the film again and had a different opinion.  I accepted Bullock as being unstable and paid more attention to the great job of the other actors and this time I enjoyed the film.  It was a ridiculously silly comedy that had more going for it than I originally thought.  Thomas Haden Church, Bradley Cooper and Ken Jeong were very good.  Cooper panicking when he realized he was being stalked by Mary, Church egging on Mary to prank Cooper and Jeong just trying to put up with the two.  Mary, as crazy as she was, came across as endearing to the people she met along the way even if she was annoying.  Entertaining silly fare. D.J. Qualls had a small role but came acrossed as an offbeat character with a kind heart.",1407628800,,920,4.333333333333333

acting.  I understand she received a Razie or something like that all I can figure is that they didn't have any bad movies to choose from because the acting in this movie is outstanding.  All the actors did a great job. You don't want to miss this one the sex scene in the beginning is not too bad that you can just wait till it is over and there are not any more. I really like this movie so will you.",1401926400,,608,4.041666666666667
3982958,5,B002SYAGN2,"This movie is very funny and quirky...and has a great back story.  :)  First, yes, I adore Sandra Bullock, but her character in this movie, Mary Horowitz, was an absolute true to life character for a lot of people and I thought she learned some great lessons not only about herself, but about others along her journey to be with Steve.  She also helped them to see how wrong it is to only look at the surface of a person, but by being herself.
A few other reviewers said the jokes in this movie ""just weren't that funny.""  I'd have to disagree on the basis that while they are not over the top or outlandish jokes as in some movies, they were not supposed to be.  Mary was a not-so-social / not-so-normal personality, who really liked herself, but others just couldn't ""get.""  She wasn't trying to BE funny, she was trying to be the person everyone else wanted her to be...until she realized that there really were some people who understood how great she was.  If you're looking for an everyday-funny movie this is it, but if you're looking for outlandish-funny you should choose Ace Ventura.

If you like Sandra Bullock, I would also recommend you google her acceptance speech at the Razzies for her performance in this movie...She's accepts it with great humor, while subtly pointing out some of the key elements of Mary's character!  LOL  I agreed, the voters must not have watched the movie!  ;)

The story line is ridiculous, and even the gag reel isn't funny. Her incessant rambling manages to annoy the crap out of a deaf kid.

An argument can be made that this was a typical movie for her, but not a typical character. I thought this movie was quite charming and entertaining. She definitely makes the movie for me. It kept my interest and there were some definite laugh-out-loud scenes. Mostly, I enjoyed watching Sandra play this character... someone who may, at first, seem strange, nerdy, ditzy, but is just someone very real without any pretense whatsoever.

Why anyone would be rooting for this pysco to get the guy is beyond me.  The news stories that they scatter throughout the movie to qualify as a plot are all very bad jokes.

3983027,5,B002SYAGN2,"... I'm clearly in the minority, but I adored this story of Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock), a very (freakishly) smart, very socially awkward crossword puzzle constructor, who lives with her parents and has a pet gerbil (I think that's what it was). She's also incredibly happy in general - just a bright-eyed, trusting soul, in love with words and the world around her. (I'm not bright-eyed or all that trusting, but I've been called ""weird"" a time or two in my life, so I can relate.)

Her attempt to ""be normal"" involves being set up on a blind date with Steve, a cameraman for a national TV news organization. She literally attacks him in his truck before they even leave the driveway. He of course, thinks ""oh, she's cuckoo"", then makes an excuse and a what he means to be a polite brush-off, but that she takes as an actual invitation.

So, when her next crossword puzzle is literally ALL ABOUT STEVE, and she gets fired, she takes his off-hand remark as an invitation and follows him around the country.

There are some truly amusing moments in this movie - she gets tricked into getting off a bus, which pulls away, because she talks too much; she then takes a ride with a trucker, and writes his driver's license # on her arm, so he can't murder her and get away with it, and then reads the truck manual; she asks a deaf girl what kind of deafness she has, etc. etc.

Her smartness, and curiosity, is refreshing. And the ending is sweet.

The only thing I didn't like was Sandy's haircut & color: this character would not have highlighted, fixed hair. She just wouldn't care.

However, it's a sweet story about learning to be true to yourself. As she says in the end (paraphrasing), ""you don't have to be 'normal', just have to find people who are 'normal' like you.""",1339891200,4,1775,4.514018691588785

And The Proposal was OK, but this one really made me laugh out loud... over and over. Like, why did she just walk into that hole? It was kind of too big to miss!

Sandra's character, Mary, was just so lovable, you could almost forget she was a stalker and hope she would win Steve over in the end. And I was so amused by her language quirkiness.

Throw in a cast of characters in all the bit parts (hey, there's the super skinny guy from Road Trip and the Dr. Johnny Fever from ""WKRP in Cincinnati"") and it actually works despite the flimsy premise of an annoying, and possibly mentally unbalanced stalker yet ultimately a charming, woman who just sees life from an angle not many of us come from.

There are people out there that use words as a way to fill the spaces... many, unfortunately ""diagnosed"" with aspergers syndrome.  Bullock's portrayal as a woman so enthused with love, yet so removed from social norms, isn't that far fetched.  Many of us have no idea what to do, and when to do it when it comes to matters of the heart.  Understandably, her character is perhaps considered as eccentric in comparison to most, however that is what makes this movie so fun loving.  Her character has a certain naivety that many people lose when adapting to quote, un-quote, social norms.  The best part of it is that the end focuses on real true love, with herself, which is so much more important than landing the guy.

No, I would never recommend this film, but I can't say that Thomas Haden Church's sly delivery didn't make me laugh or that Sandra's manic expressions didn't produce giggles on my end.  The story is just a mess though.  To believe that Steve was anything worth Mary's obsession is far fetched since he's not nearly good looking enough to evoke impulsive rushes of uncontrollable lust, and he's not nice enough of a person to have felt a `connection' to.  In the end, Mary just comes across like a horny autistic person.  The end was a ridiculous attempt at giving this meaningless movie `meaning' and it just all felt kind of insulting.  Still, this is not the worst movie of last year (`Year One' anyone) and Sandra does not deliver the worst performance of that year either (I'm looking at you Hannah Montana).  That said, I'd still stay pretty far away from it.",1286150400,3,1177,4.6298076923076925

3983051,2,B002SYAGN2,"Some may think this is a sweet romantic comedy with difference; others would think this is a miscalculated farce or a screwball comedy gone wrong. Whatever it is, ""All About Steve"" is in a nutshell about Sandra Bullock's love-struck heroine going, ""I love him"" (repeat three times) and ""where he goes I'll follow"" (three times again). Sandra Bullock`s over-the-top comic performance, which brought her a Razzie award for the ""worst actress,"" has given another meaning to the lyrics of ""I Will Follow You,"" a good oldie song by Little Peggy March. I didn't know this famous pop song was about stalking.

Sandra Bullock plays a forty-something crossword puzzle constructor Mary Horowitz, who meets a TV cameraman Steve (Bradley Cooper) on a blind date set up by her parents. Within ten minutes of meeting Steve, Mary believes he is her true love and attempts to make love with him in a car. After making an ""inspired"" crossword puzzle no one can solve, she travels around the country to follow Steve, who goes on the road following a story with a reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Haden Church) and Angus (Ken Jeong).

""All About Steve,"" presumably a pun on ""All About Eve,"" is a typical example of a messy filmmaking that would make you think, ""What are they thinking?"" We simply don't know what the film is all about. The story is weak. Jokes are not very funny. Its satire doesn't bite. Characters are quirky, maybe a bit too quirky. Sandra Bullock's character, always wearing red knee-high boots, appears as a charming eccentric, and soon gets downright irritating with her endless chattering. Maybe not as irritating as Roberto Benigni in his ""Pinocchio,"" I admit, but still very close.

Perhaps the biggest problem about ""All About Steve"" is the heroine herself. For a comedy of this kind to succeed, the central character(s) need to be more likable. They can be eccentric as much as they like, but they have to be someone you want to spend some time with, and Mary is not among them. After all, we need someone to laugh with, not at, but despite its sweet and neat conclusion, it seems the film is tempting us to do the latter.",1280275200,4,2130,4.766937669376694
3983052,3,B002SYAGN2,"...your acting wasn't the worst performance I've seen.  It was just underwhelming.

Bullock plays the main lead Mary, a quirky trivial chatterbox who became obsessed with a news camera operator named Steve (Bradley Cooper) after a blind date, so she traveled across the nation to follow him.  I didn't find Bullock convincing as a quirky character. Oftentimes, she sounded bored whenever she talks like Daffy Duck.  I thought that such a chatty and extroverted character would be best suited for Kathy Griffin...but in hindsight, having Kathy Griffin playing this character would be an agonizing performance.  Maybe Bullock underplaying her role is actually a blessing.

As for her stalkee, Steve, he's rather uninteresting.  He only had a couple of developements in the film: being scared and eventually accepting Mary's odd ways.  But there's nothing inbetween those developments that showed he's changed.  I couldn't find a loving chemistry between those two.  Matter of fact, I see Mary better off paired with Thomas Haden Church's character, an egotistic news reporter who tried to fend from his rivals.  He was enamored with himself at first and he did make things bad for Steve by telling Mary their next destination, but later he thought a little less about himself and he tried to do a brave thing to Mary later in the film, which Steve should've done himself if he cared.  He fleshed out more as a character, so I find him the better choice.

Does ""All About Steve"" really deserve the critical lashing and razzie awards it has?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-2/dp/B002IPFWTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Transformers 2""</a>&nbsp;certainly does, but I think the haters complained about this film for the wrong reasons.  Sure, the movie is very cynical and rather self-absored, and the stalker aspect of the story is a bit unflattering, but it's all deliberate; plus, they're treated rather wholesomely.  Mary is sorta charming as a character.  Sure, she talks way too much, but other people in the film acknowledge her annoying trait so that's the joke; she also had an ugly wig (but then again, so has Bullock's character in ""The Blind Side"").  Otherwise, her bubbly, obsessive eccentricity made her a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pucca/dp/081098038X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pucca</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Megumi-Noda/dp/0345481720/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Megumi Noda</a>&nbsp;(pardon the anime nerd speak), so that's why I find her amusing.

The jokes revolve around her chatty attitude, which got old very fast, but the movie does have moments that made me giggle, like Ken Jeong talking smack on Steve and the news reporter, the part where Steve thought Mary's carrying a machete (his reaction and timing was good), and the part where the deaf kids just felt in a collapsed hole from out of nowhere.  The story got weak later on when people suddenly find Mary to be an inspiration, which lead to a cheesy misplaced conclusion.  But on the whole, ""All About Steve"" is an odd film, but certainly an appealing film.  It's worth a look for those who want a little crazy in their rom-com.",1279411200,,3281,5.655102040816327

3983054,3,B002SYAGN2,"I continue to look back at the reviews from some of the main critics on this movie, to make sure I viewed the same film.  The film was just trashed by most people and I admittedly only saw it because it was on my cable premium channel for free.  I figured I had some time to kill; the girlfriend always likes Sandra Bullock movies, so why not give it a shot.  I still had my scotch in hand if things got too bad.  Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the film quite a bit.  I am still unsure what all of the fuss was about.

Sandra Bullock holds down a job as a cross word puzzle constructor.  I will say the movie does not paint this occupation in a good light.  Are all the people who hold down this job really that quirky?  She is an extremely intelligent person, and we could call her unique as well.  Damn, if I am straight with you, she reminded me of a couple creepy girls from college.  One girl actually tracked me down at my house after one date.  I still don't know how she found out where I lived.

Sandra lives at home with her parents and she talks a lot.  I mean she talks all of the time.  I live in a house with my girlfriend and three daughters and all of them combined do not talk that much.  Well, maybe all of the combined.  Despite all of Sandra's social issues, she has a good heart, but just hasn't found the right guy yet.  Her mother sets her up on a blind date, with Bradley Cooper of all people and she likes him so much she tries to do him in the back of his SUV, right outside of her parent's house.  The sentimental occasion gets broken up by his job calling, but he inadvertently suggests he might enjoy seeing her on the road at his next assignment.  He is the cameraman for a news team.

Crazy Sandra takes this to heart and starts stalking, I mean following him like a groupie.  At one point he really starts freaking out about the whole thing.  I loved Thomas Haden Church's character and how he encouraged her to keep up her unnatural pursuits.  Church was absolutely hilarious, even if he played his typical dry sense of humor character he has honed to a science.  As with all good romantic comedies, we find out Sandra might be crazy, but she is a truly good person, and her endearing qualities win over the crowd, if not the boy of her dreams.
I should make a note here.  It is getting extremely hard to watch a movie with Bradley Cooper in my house.  If I have to hear how hot he is from my girlfriend one more time. I might jump out of our first floor window.  Hey, I might find it annoying, but I don't want to hurt myself over it.  The girlfriend's friend was over a few nights ago, and we had her watch ""The Hangover"".  She had not seen it.  OMG, it was nonstop drooling over the guy.  Anyway, back to our main story.

I enjoyed the movie.  It wasn't a stellar theatrical production, but it holds its own and you have several laughs in the process as well.  I still have no idea what movie some of the major critics were watching.  But from my humble perspective, you could do far worse than sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn watching Sandra Bullock drive Bradley Cooper absolutely bonkers with her hilariously funny, if not sometimes crazy, antics.

Although the character could be annoying, she still seemed like someone that would also be good to have as a friend, particularly as she evolved by the end of the movie.  I think that it would not be a stretch to compare Mary to PeeWee Herman in ""PeeWee's Big Adventure.""

It definitely had it's moments and didn't really drag on or use all of the funny-parts in the trailer like some movies. If you're looking for non-stop laughs, this isn't it - if you're looking to be entertained for a couple hours and have some good laughs, check it out.

I found the video and audio quality to be very good for a comedy - most of the time you get a ""normal"" transfer/audio track on Blu-Ray comedies, but this one had a very nice amount of clarity/sharpness/detail/colors. The surround sound was also very good during some of the action parts. I'd give both a 4 out of 5. Unfortunately, the version I bought was the ""Rental"" edition, so the extras were missing. It looks to have about an hours worth of extras on the retail disc (plus a commentary), most of which sound entertaining.

She is abetted by a terrific supporting cast notably Thomas Haden Church as a vain TV reporter and Bradley Cooper as the cameraman who is the object of her affections(obsessions?).  This is classic screwball stuff that once the notoriety of the Razzie Bullock won wears off will develope a deserved cult following.

Sandra Bullock plays a person with an intellectual IQ at one end of the scale and a social IQ at the other end. We are supposed to believe that this is the cause of her problem, when in reality it is her shallowness. Her shallowness (and concomitant lack of character) makes the whole film ring so false that at the end of the movie one cannot even decipher what the meaning of the film was. Was it that being different is OK? If that is the case, then the film was a horrible failure. Or perhaps it was supposed to be that one should follow one's heart and dreams. Well now, that wouldn't be a bad message if the dream was based upon something *real* rather than the product of some delusion or if the goal was something noble and meaningful.

3983068,3,B002SYAGN2,"Sandra Bullock ""won"" a Razzie for the worst film of the year the same year she won an Oscar for The Blind Side.  All About Steve is that film.

The film tries to find its footing in the overacting antics of one Mary Horowitz, a walking encyclopedia of knowledge of disrelated facts that goes on and on and on gabbering incessantly without a clue as to how she's affecting others.  Have you seen such people?

But the movie does more than show us an eccentricity.  It's a reflective parody on several levels: See how people treat others who are not ""normal.""  It's not ""normal"" to live with your parents at 40, not to have a lover, to take your minor job as a crossword puzzlemaker seriously.  And to chase after a guy you just met in your quest to have a ""normal"" relationship.

And Mary meets people who are crazier than she is!  She says, ""How do you do"" to one guy at a rally protesting a baby getting its third leg amputated (long story) and he says, ""I don't know what you mean.""

Pretty convoluted story.  Some laugh out moments.  The media/TV news parodies are especially insightful.  The anchors basically making up news as they go along, ""I don't want to speculate but..."" and then do so.  Announcers and cameramen bouncing off each other, driving vans, constantly on the lookout for news.  Predatory.  And a bit scarily close to the truth!

All About Steve is really about Mary.  It's a film that is a comedy of sorts, a few insightful moments but not much else.  If anything, in desparate need of a scriptwriter or editor!

There was one cute quote, though:  ""If you love a man let him go.  If you have to stalk him, you didn't love him in the first place!""  Oh, a scene at the end of the credits, you can miss it.

My DVD rental had nothing special, a few trailers and scene selection.

When we entered the theater, we were puzzled since we were the only ones there, and when the lights went down we each took a different row just like you might on an unexpectedly empty plane during a night flight.  The movie began with just the two of us, and we weren't even bored yet, when the film ground to a halt, literally.  The screen went dark, the lights went up in the house, and an official of the movie chain approached us in our rows.  Apologetically he said that the showing had been cancelled due to poor attendance and that we would be getting our money back.

""When's the next showing?"" asked my wife.

""There won't be any more,"" he said apologetically.

""But it just opened on Friday.""  (This was Sunday afternoon.)

""We won't be showing it again,"" said the manager.  ""Starting at 7:00 p/m we're bringing back Star Trek.""

""We saw that,"" we objected.  But as it turned out we saw it a second time, and it was fine.  We saw a lot of things in the movie we'd missed first time around.

""All About Steve"" was directed by Phil Traill whose experience consists mostly of occasional TV episodes and was written by Kim Barker who wrote ""License to Wed"". If I had that tidbit of information, I'm sure I would have steered clear. This movie reeks of inexperience despite a normally charming and charismatic leading lady.

The story follows Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock), a crossword puzzle constructor who is a little too smart and talks a bit too much for her own good. She goes on a blind date with Steve (Bradley Cooper) and is so drawn to his good looks and smell that she immediately jumps him in his vehicle like an Axe body spray commercial. At first aroused, Steve quickly becomes disturbed by Mary's enthusiasm and running mouth and invents an excuse to get away from her hoping to never see her again. Mary's infatuation interferes with her work and once jobless, she decides to take a risk and follow Steve on the road. It would be logical after multiple rejections for her to get the idea and go home, but she is prodded onward by Thomas Haden Church's news corespondent who apparently just has a sick sense of humor and likes using her words to sound smarter in his broadcast. All of this should be enough to let you know the story is painful.

Sandra Bullock is usually so cute and her snorting laugh so charming. Here, no matter what she does she has so much annoying dialogue that the only endearing quality she retains are those red boots. Bradley Cooper is a very hot guy, but comes off as an absolute moron. For example he attempt to don a disguise while forgetting he is still with the other two very recognizable people he works with in their obvious news van. Ken Jeong completes the news team threesome and never really has any material to be funny with.

When I saw Mary fall into the hole in the trailer, I cracked up hysterically. I thought that could be just one of many funny moments in the movie, but no, that is THE main funny moment in the movie that doesn't occur till near the last act and becomes such a desperate rescue mission that it doesn't make it as fun to laugh at anymore. All the jokes in this movie just aren't THAT funny unfortunately and I wanted to like this movie.

The saddest part of the movie is where Steve almost rewards Mary's stalker behavior by telling her never to change. Congratulations, Kim Barker, you've given a whole new generation of women permission to be psychos.",1269129600,9,2653,4.51875

3983073,3,B002SYAGN2,"I read in a news link to some piece of tabloid trash that said Sandra Bullock received a Razzie for this film. I decided to watch it because she was quoted as saying what I considered to be a convincing defense for the film and her performance.

A lot of people have been really hard on this movie, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's quirky, goofy and lighthearted, so if you watch it expecting a typical romantic comedy where ""boy meets girl and they fall head over heels in love against all odds"" or you are looking for some kind of life-changing message ... then I'm predicting that you'll be disappointed.

All About Steve is a spoof with over the top characters who demonstrate particular personality traits to an extreme. Sandra Bullock was portrayed as a satirical version of a person with an IQ that's off the charts but appears to have very little common sense, can be annoying as hell because their brain is in overdrive most of the time, and they have no clue as to when they should simply keep their mouths shut. It's like their head is so full that they can hardly contain all of the information they have.

Her character is so much like some of the total brainiacs I've known: a plethora of information (often seemingly useless until you need it), a tendency to talk incessantly, and they often don't pay much attention to what other people think of them. But those same people can are oftten very compassionate and don't intend to distance, offend or hurt others with their words or actions ... sometimes it seems like they can't help but say exactly what's on their mind regardless of the subject matter, circumstances or the company they're in.

Without being too serious or losing the tongue-in-cheek aspect of the plot, the movie touches on the other side of that type of personality and the trouble those individuals might have relating to others - and vise versa. Maybe you need to have known a similar person to appreciate the humor in this movie ... or at the very least be in the mood to watch an off the wall comedy with an underlying theme that might subtly inspire you to at least consider people for who they really are or take a closer look before you casually write them off. It's a COMEDY! It's not intended to be a deep, philosophical drama.

My review probably sounds defensive and overly serious for a movie that is intended to be funny and entertaining. Well, I certainly found it to be both. I can only imagine how much it sucks to have people annihilate you while you should be reveling in the victory of winning an Oscar. It just goes to show you that the price you pay for fame is living under a microscope 24/7.

Give this movie a chance and hopefully you'll have a few laughs. If it's not your thing, don't write this movie off and make it sound like a failure on the part of those involved simply based on your personal taste in movies or what you typically expect from the actors that were involved.",1268697600,,2945,4.4748603351955305
3983074,5,B002SYAGN2,"I know there are people who thought this was a dumb story line but the movie is great with wonderful clean humor. There are just not many funny comedies that are funny without the crude humor these days but this one got a lot of laughs from me because you do find these people in the real world. They are the annoying ones that we wonder why?? It's funny to have this whole array of people in the comedy that can make you laugh and cry. I saw this movie once and thought yeah it's okay. It's when you watch it a second time when you realize OMG that is hilarious. It's one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time with a feel good ending.

I like the blu-ray verison with the so many extra features like deleted and alternate scenes. I know there are some scenes I wish they included in the original movie. The gag reels were great. The Hollywood Dish interview I could have lived without. The host woman was annoying and crude. I did not care for her interview style. But everything else is great on blu-ray. The red boots really shine in HD. So give the movie a try and just sit back and forget all the negative reviews. Just enjoy the movie as a movie. It's not a school project, movies are just suppose to be enjoyed and not over analyzed.",1268611200,,1252,4.195020746887967

STARRING: Sandra Bullock, Bradley Cooper, Thomas Haden Church, Ken Jeong, D.J. Qualls, Keith David, Howard Hesseman, Beth Grant, Katy Mixon and M.C. Gainey

WRITTEN BY: Kim Barker

DIRECTED BY: Phil Traill

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 04 September 2009

Other than the realization of my disappointment in the film, the first thing that came to mind after seeing All about Steve was; `Wow, that movie wasn't about Steve at all.' It could have easily been called `All about Mary', but I suppose that would be mistaken for a cheap knock-off of There's Something about Mary. So they went with just plain not-funny, instead.

It's about a frigging psycho, by the name of Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock). Mary is a crossword creator and is temporarily living with her mom and dad while her apartment is being fumigated. While she's in her 40s and is still single, her parents decide to set Mary up with a blind-date. The poor unsuspecting sap is Steve (Bradley Cooper).

Steve is a news station cameraman and has no idea what he's getting himself into. He's intrigued with the way Mary looks when he picks her up for their date and Mary is overly satisfied with Steve's appearance. So much in fact, that upon meeting him she runs back upstairs and changes her outfit for him.

Mary jumps Steve in his van, while it's still parked outside her parent's house, prior to them going on the date. At first Steve goes with the idea with a smile on his face. But as Mary starts to babble-on like a sex-crazed lunatic, along with Steve, we learn that she may have a screw or two loose.

In an attempt to let her down easy, he makes up an excuse of having to go, due to a media related emergency. He tells her he'll be on the road and mutters something about wishing she could come with him. Mary takes this to heart and decides to track him down.

She repeatedly shows up at several different locations where breaking news is happening, to surprise Steve. Steve is more than surprised. Of course, Mary doesn't take the hint that Steve is not interested in her. Things get even worse for Steve, when his friend and co-worker Hartman Hughes (Thomas Haden Church), catches on to the fact that Mary is stalking him.

Desperate for a good story, Hughes does everything he can do to convince Mary that Steve does want her around; he's just having trouble expressing his feelings for her. Being as gullible as a 5-year-old, Mary falls for this and sticks around to taunt Steve.

Mary Horowitz will no doubt annoy many. I found her to be hilarious and adorable. Sandra Bullock is an amazing actress and doesn't play Mary over the top. Mary simply is over the top, and she's a blast because of it; so long as you're not Steve.

What doesn't work in the film is everything that happens. There is no plot, no flow, and it tries way too hard to be funny. The people in it are funny, but the movie is not.

For some reason the film is advertised as a romantic comedy, but trust me, it's not. Steve isn't even in the film for that long and as far as romance is concerned, the unsettling relationship between Kathy Bates and James Caan's characters in Misery, probably has more for you. And why do we take a complete turn for the worst in the third act, by having Mary spend the last third of the film stuck in a hole in the ground? Where did this come from?

Thomas Haden Church has been hilarious ever since his days on Wings, and he is a treat here as well. Bradley Cooper, Keith David, Ken Jeong and M.C. Gainey are all perfect too. But their characters are stuck in a movie that doesn't know what to do with them. The movie could have been so much more, had they toned down Mary's psychotic-ness and converted this into either a romantic comedy with more scenes with Steve, or just written it as a better comedy; with less lame and more funny on the agenda.",1268438400,2,3863,4.475106685633001
3983076,5,B002SYAGN2,"Ignore all the piling on from critics who savaged this movie. I know people who've given this movie a one star rating--without even seeing it!

Sandra Bullock portrays a brilliant, over-achiever who writes cross-word puzzles for a living and she becomes obsessed with gorgeous, sexy Bradley Cooper (who wouldn't?) The story-line has her following him across country when a tornado hits and she falls into a deserted coal mine

The obvious problem I had was the way her character was written.  She can drive you to groans and wincing but Sandra still pulls it off--at the end, she's touching and beautiful.

I'm writing this review on the morning when all the internet buzz about tonight's Oscars scream that she picked up a Razzie Award as worst actress for All Above Steve.  How strange but wonderful it would be should Sandra receive her first Oscar Award for her astonishing tour-de-force performance in the best movie of 2009: The Blind Side.",1267920000,,946,4.9245283018867925

But this one showed a different side and I loved it. I thought Sandra Bullock did a great job in this role. Her character was a bit hard to believe but at the same time most women don't follow the man around the country. They just wait until he comes back to make their life ""All About (insert male name)"". I loved the odd people that were also in the movie that made it just that much more better.

Whilst Sandra's character is hard to empathise with (which creates a major difficulty and directly affects the success of the film) and assuming you can buy the idea of her dressing like someone 15 years younger than her, the supporting guys in the cast add some weirdness and lift up the movie, making it worth watching for me.
Thomas Haden Church and Ken Jeong are the reasons I will return to this film - not anytime soon, but we'll be keeping the film in our collection for a while.

There is comedy, but there is a fair amount in the story that seems to go unexplained (such as why the male main character is being followed) which makes this a hard film to like.

I do recommend it as a rental.",1263254400,,807,4.233766233766234
3983090,2,B002SYAGN2,"Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock) is a crossword puzzle constructor for a local newspaper. A virtual paragon of knowledge, Mary lives for nothing more than work and her bits of useless trivia, unloading her knowledge to all who will listen. Steve (Bradley Cooper) is a camera man working with television reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Hayden Church) for the local CCN news channel. When Mary's parents and Steve's parents set them up on a blind date, Steve doesn't have a great time and ends the date early while Mary sees him as the one and pursues him across the country.

In 2009, Sandra Bullock had a red letter year at the movies. She started off the year with the romantic comedy The Proposal which became the highest grossing movie of her career. Later in the year she starred in The Blind Side which not only passed the $200 million to topple The Proposal as Bullock's highest grossing movie, but also proved that she truly had star power as her name was the sole star name on the marquee and has given the starlet Oscar buzz almost guaranteeing an Oscar nomination for Best Actress which would also be a career first. Bradley Cooper also had a great year that saw him starring in The Hangover which became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time, and getting cast in an upcoming A Team remake. With both stars having career years at the movies, you'd think this pairing would make for thrilling cinema.

Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you that you'd be wrong. While I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics would tell you (showing up on many critic's worst of the year lists), I have to admit that the movie is not good. The characters in the movie find themselves in positions that are too absurd as the screenplay takes them to places that just don't really seem to fit. Also, the characters are not well written, being either cardboard cutouts of real people, or being too quirky for their own good. Sandra Bullock comes off the worst. While her acting is not bad, the character is too hapless, too unconvincing with too many quirks that leave you wondering how this woman survived this long in the modern world. The movie also tries to hard to make a statement about following the ""right road,"" being true to yourself, while also being a satire of sensationalist news coverage. The result is a climax that doesn't feel true to the tone of the rest of the movie while also being so sweet and sentimental that you'll find yourself in a diabetic coma by the movie's end.

If there is a good point to this movie it's the news crew sent out by CCN to report on occurrences where no one else is available comprised of Steve, Hartman Hughes, and Angus (Ken Jeong). If they would have been played by any other actors they wouldn't have been so fun to watch, but their comedic timing is such that even at their most unlikable they still come across as fun to watch and make you feel that the movie should have revolved around them. They're playful jokey banter with each other, and hapless pranks that essentially drive the plot of the movie accentuates the type of the bromance love that we've been seeing in movies lately. While not the best written material, the actors play it well, and for that I have to give them props.

On a certain level I can slightly recommend this movie, but on another level I cannot. It can be fun at times, and at other times it can be beyond ridiculous. If you're looking for a chuckle here or there and mindless entertainment you can probably get over my issues with the film (although Mary might still grate on your nerves a bit), but if you want more than I suggest you look for it elsewhere.

Whereas, All About Steve made over 33 million at the box office domestically. I know that is still not that great, but it clearly wiped the floor compared to Gigl. It'a a funny, quirky, weird, awkward, nice, sweet, and strange comedy wrapped into one movie. In regards to the movie it is unbelivable, but somewhat true. I'm not going to go over what the movie is about because many people here have done that. I will say that there are women like this, that society does make fun of.

The result is pretty heinous albeit a minor blip in Bullock's banner year as a box-office draw and respectable actress between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proposal/dp/B002K0WBXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proposal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blind-Side/dp/B002VECM6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blind Side</a>. Nonetheless, you can tell there is something more audacious and even humanistic underneath the laborious hi-jinks that Bullock must have seen in the concept, but the execution is so bungled that you really can't tell whether she wanted to make a Monty Python-style absurdist farce or rather a subversive anti-romantic comedy.

Bullock plays Mary Magdalene Horowitz, a compulsive crossword puzzle creator for a Sacramento newspaper. Living with her parents, Mary is an encyclopedic chatterbox in red-leather go-go boots. Granted she's pretty (since Bullock is playing her), but she is also interminably annoying and sadly leads a spinster's lonely existence in her circa-1971-decorated bedroom. Mary's concerned parents set her up on a blind date with the titular Steve, a good-looking cable news cameraman whose devilish smile sets her hormones racing. After an aggressive physical romp in his SUV immediately after they meet, he flees the scene with an empty promise of wishing she could come with him. That's enough for Mary to follow Steve to his home base in Tuscon and then to Oklahoma where a story unfolds over a little girl born with a third leg. There she meets a couple of kindred spirits who are ""pro-leg"" and tag along on her pursuit. They pursue Steve to Galveston, Texas, where they get caught in the eye of a tornado.

Things come to a head when a group of deaf children fall into a mine shaft in Colorado, and Mary inadvertently becomes the center of the news story. The movie gets a little more serious toward the end as it deals with worthwhile topics like self-acceptance and diversity, but it's just too little, too late. To her credit, Bullock at least appears engaged and unapologetic in presenting a disturbed character that is a challenge to the viewer's sensibilities, but she is left abandoned by the filmmakers in making Mary work as a sympathetic protagonist. Perhaps because he has played too many morally compromised characters in films, Bradley Cooper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>) cannot seem to offset Bullock's eccentricities with any real conviction and fades noticeably from the central conflict. Thomas Haden Church (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sideways/dp/B0007TKOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sideways</a>) is on familiar ground as pompous, fame-mongering reporter Hartman Hughes, who manipulates Mary's obsession with Steve into his own media circus.

In a normal role for a change, Ken Jeong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>) is actually subdued as Angus, the third member of the news crew. DJ Qualls (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hustle-Flow/dp/B000BITUWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hustle & Flow</a>) and Katy Mixon do what they can around Bullock as Mary's fellow outcasts. The 2009 DVD offers more extras than the film frankly deserves with Bullock, Cooper, Church, Jeong, Traill, and Barker contributing to an entertaining commentary track that makes me think they made a different movie entirely. Nine deleted scenes and a standard making-of featurette are also included, and so are a montage clip accompanied by Cooper and Jeong singing a strangely unfunny song, and a boring slide show of the film crew with Bullock performing her own rap to it. None of these features make the film any better than it is, but at least Bullock can look back at 2009 as the year she proved that two out of three ain't bad.",1261526400,,4421,6.162074554294976

3983115,2,B002SYAGN2,"What a waste of time for my husband and me. This movie just isn't worth watching. It is a waste of acting ability for Sandra Bullock. She has so much more worth than this extremely shallow movie. Within 15 minutes she is in her underwear trying to have sex with some guy she just met, who is the Steve the title comes from. Romantic comedy doesn't describe this movie. There would have to be some romance some where for it to be given that description. This is one I won't be buying or recommending!",1259452800,2,499,4.319148936170213
3983116,2,B002SYAGN2,"Sandra Bullock's over the top charm just isn't enough to save this horrible script. This has to be one of the worst comedies i've seen in while. I can't believe Bradley Cooper went from one of the best comedies ever (The Hangover) to this.  Sandra Bullock also amazed me with her role in my pick for Best Romantic Comedy of the year, The Proposal. What happened? This movie is supposed to be funny but it doesn't deliver. It's about this nerdy woman falling for this news camera man who could careless about her. She follows him all over the country trying to prove her love when clearly he does not want to be with her. This could have been very funny but most of the jokes fall flat.  With the exception of the always humourous performance of Thomas Hadden Church, nothing in this movie is really funny. Sandra Bullock is a great actress but her character is extremely annoying in this film. You are supposed to feel sorry for her but it's impossible. She is a walking contradiction, If she's suppose to be so intelligent how is that she can't see this guy does not want her. Was she blinded by love? No, because at the end she comes to her senses and walks away from him like he's a complete nobody. I don't think this one is even worth renting. It's a complete waste of time unless you are a huge Sandra Bullock fan like me. Then it's almost worth it.",1258156800,2,1355,4.373015873015873

I found myself laughing a fair amount of the time during the movie. I got the joke that the media always looks for the worst in a situation to sensationalize it. When you watch the movie you have to wait until the end of the credits, there is a bonus scene after the credits that is worth waiting for.  Is it the greatest movie ever, no, but it is good movie to make you laugh.",1257724800,12,502,4.164948453608248

It loses the fifth star because some of the comedy is not shown to full advantage due to some plot underdevelopment and a few stupid gaps in logic that would have been easy to fix or omit.
