4189959,3,B003T04NAG,"I bought this movie expecting a Jackie Chan Martial Arts movie...and was incredibly disappointed.  What I got was a desent story about a boy who is having difficulties in life and daydreams about becoming Jackie Chan's deciple.  We runs away to persue this dream and runs into problems along the way.

All in all... the story was good, the dubbing was horrible, the action was ok, the acting was sub par, and Jackie Chan played himself while not doing much fighting.  The movie does send a good message, even with it being in Chinese.",1289433600,2,534,4.648936170212766
4189960,1,B003T04NAG,"The description and DVD picture make you think Jackie Chan is a main character of this movie well he is NOT. He has a few cameo appearances. This movie was boring and lame. I felt betrayed in a sense. I bought the movie because of Jackie Chan but all it was, was an advertisement about how great he is. The movie is about a slacker, disrespectful kid who is obsessed about Jackie and scrambles all over wanting to be his disciple. He goes on and on about Jackie his hero. Lame lame lame! Buy another movie, this one will leave you disappointed!",1286323200,3,544,4.3431372549019605
4189961,1,B003T04NAG,"I never rate any movie in my life, but I feel like it's my obligation to warn the public about this movie. This is the worst movie I've watched in my life. It doesn't deserve even one star (but sadly I have to put at least one star due to the default rating system)The cover with Jackie Chan is misleading because he only showed for 5 mins. I rented this from the redbox and that is 1 dollar wasted! (and my time wasted)",1286064000,,420,4.072289156626506
4189962,1,B003T04NAG,"I rented this movie, expecting the normal Jackie Chan helping of humour and action. It is not. It is a poorly put together flick about a geeky kid with a few shots of Jackie. Don't buy it or rent it.",1285804800,2,199,4.0
4189963,1,B003T04NAG,"So I watched this on Netflix instant stream, and it was nothing how I expected it to be.  Being a huge JC fan (have all his movies on dvd), this is by far the worse one that ive seen, you think The Tuxedo and The Medallion were bad...wait till you see this.  Its a very low budget movie, seems like a bunch of high schoolers made it, and somehow got JC to do a cameo.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this unless you absolutely just HAVE to collect all of his movies that JC is in.",1284249600,13,481,4.042105263157895
4189964,1,B003T04NAG,"I love Jackie Chan and his movies. Don't be fooled by the title and the box art. This is a poorly made movie about a kid who dreams of meeting Jackie Chan. Jackie pops up once or twice in some on-the-set action scenes that are so substandard they're painful to watch. ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" had better fight scenes. The whole movie looks like somebody shot it with their home video camera, and Jackie volunteered to give them an hour of his time one afternoon. My kids hated it. Even fast-forwarding to the ""action"" didn't help this turkey. I rented it for a dollar and still felt ripped off. If you're a true Jackie fan, I just wanted to warn you. This movie is so bad it makes Jackie's rare turkeys like ""The Tuxedo"" seem like ""Drunken Master"".",1284249600,34,746,4.452554744525547
4189965,5,B003T04NAG,I love Jackie Chan movies..old or new because he always do his own stunt...I love his comedian and action moves,1399680000,,111,4.6
4189966,1,B003T04NAG,"I think the title of this comment already explain what happen about the movie, no need for any more word.  The Chinese title of this movie is something like ""The search of Jackie Chan"", which is quite different from the English title.",1397520000,,234,4.571428571428571
4189967,1,B003T04NAG,"a slight disappointment as I should have probably read the package.

Though the story line teaches some great points in life....it probably isn't something I'm going to keep",1376265600,,173,5.178571428571429
4189968,5,B003T04NAG,"First off I bought the Blu-Ray release and read all the negative reviews about this movie and as I was reading them I had a flashback to a similar movie with Chuck Norris. I couldn't remember the title of that movie but I searched IMDB and found that it was called Sidekicks&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sidekicks-DVD-Region-1-Chuck-Norris-Jonathan-Brandis/dp/B001BFXCUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sidekicks DVD Region 1 Chuck Norris Jonathan Brandis</a>. So if you liked Sidekicks then you'll most likely like this movie as well!
Just don't knock it till you tried it! Also you could always return it and get your money back if you don't!! lol But I will be keeping mine cause I actually did like it!! lol",1372809600,,752,5.723214285714286
4189969,1,B003T04NAG,I've never bought a movie and felt so ripped off. Jackie Chan is in this movie for about 5 minutes. It's shot like a high school film project. I wish I could give it zero stars.,1358553600,,177,3.9444444444444446
4189970,1,B003T04NAG,"I rented it thinking it was a story about a boy finding a Master to teach him instead i got 85mins of nothing. I skipped through most of it and was like my God who would make this film. The boy in it was just annoying and it was so terrible to watch. It says he learned some life lessons I didn't see any. He almost got a Police Woman killed who took him in and fed him. During that he lost his chance to meet JC. The other people he met the criminals well one escaped and almost beat the Police Woman to death but we don't know what happened to him or the lady who lived in the Temple. We never find out what happened to the Police Woman. In the end he finally meets JC who tells him to study and later takes a pic with the boy saying i will send it to u after u pass ur classes and when u finish school find me again I will take u as a Disciple. I hoped to see in the end that he was training with JC especially the scene where after he throws his phone away thinking JC lied to him he gets a text and runs back in slow motion. I was hoping to see an older version training with JC but instead him and his friends are playing on a boat.

It was waste of time and nothing about it has to do with JC I did hope it would be like Chuck Norris's Sidekicks but instead it was just a waste.

Don't rent or buy this film I got lucky i rented it for free and still don't feel it was worth it. If I could give it negative stars i would give it -5 stars it is that bad.",1307836800,3,1460,3.737012987012987
4189971,1,B003T04NAG,"I figure I spend about $2.00 a movie for rentals since I joined NetFlix.  This is the only 'Jackie Chan' movie that IS NOT worth $2.00.  From a 'customer, beware' perspective the worst thing about this movie is that it is not really a Jackie Chan movie: there are a couple of lackluster fight scenes featuring Jackie and a few lines of dialogue interspersed throughout the movie - I estimate roughly ten minutes of Jackie in almost ninety interminably stupid minutes of film.  From any other perspective, the worst thing about this movie: a tie between the protagonist (a potential Razzie winner for: most annoying teenager in a movie - ever) and the plot (oh wait, there isn't one; just a poorly concocted quest for face time with Jackie, a quest featuring one insipid, irrelevant, and unresolved adventure after another).  Close runners-up for worst things about this movie: the action (there is very little and what little there is is poorly choreographed and poorly filmed), the dialogue (yeesh, the romantic dialogue in Phantom Menace, which is execrable, is Oscar-worthy compared to the dialogue in this turkey), and the acting (unless you really enjoy watching a teenage boy act like a six-year old boy who was just told that the family really wasn't going to be able to go to Disneyland - for ninety, non-stop minutes of puling, whining, and crying).

For those of you who don't like reading long reviews - this movie blows chunks ... serious chunks ... disturbingly large and gut-wrenching chunks.",1300752000,2,1506,4.913385826771654
4189972,4,B003T04NAG,I will agree that the title and the front cover has nothing to do with this movie.. but because I am chinese I switched it to the orginal language mandarin and was much more pleasing to watch and listen to then listening to fake poorly acted English.  Theres a few really funny parts in the movie I would not suggest watching the movie in english at all its not worth it so if your chinese and can understand the orginal movie then its a real enjoyable movie to watch with the family.,1299369600,,484,4.260869565217392
4189973,1,B003T04NAG,Possibly the worst film I've seen in decades. Jackie Chan gets more screen time in LOTR than in this terrible low budget pile of crap. Avoid at all costs.,1293580800,2,154,4.344827586206897
4189974,1,B003T04NAG,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen.  Jackie Chan, you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing these movie making idiots to 'use' your name and images to purposely mislead the public like this.

1. The Title has nothing to do with this movie.
2. The Picture on the DVD box also has nothing to do with this movie.
3. This movie is so far fetched, unrealistic and a total waste of time.

The story is about a 16 yr old boy (present day - again, having nothing to do with the 'historic costumes on the DVD cover)... who is bullied at school, and as he idolises Jackie Chan, he wants to become Jackie's diciple and learn Kung Fu to beat up his school mates.

This is rediculous, as any 16 yr old kid would have more brains that to actually follow through with it.
What's more rediculous is that he goes to Beijing to find Jackie... and everyone in Beijing is 'Oh-so helpful' to his cause...

During his search for Jackie, he 'traverse' a few situations that have no relevance what so ever
1. Living in a Monastry with a female Buddhist student who is really a movie actress wannabe.
2. Gets kidnapped by some amateur extorionists.
3. Befriends and saves a police woman, and in doing so, missed meeting Jackie Chan.

None of these incidences were ever closed in the plot of the movie.

In the end, he gets to meet Jackie who tells him, ""Go home and study... coz you're China's future.""

Don't waste your time on this movie.  I was riding my exercise bike and my eyes were more sore than my thighs after the workout.",1290384000,9,1530,4.340350877192982
8404848,1,B003T04NAG,Avoid this movie at all costs.  It is really about a selfish brat who wants to see Jackie. Jackie is in the movie for a total of about 10 minutes tops.,1528156800,,151,3.870967741935484
8404849,5,B003T04NAG,Thank you.,1525046400,,10,4.5
8404850,1,B003T04NAG,Do not buy this movie. I only came to tell you how bad it is. Everyone can't be wrong and having watched it.... Just... Just don't buy this. You'll be glad you listened.,1476576000,,169,4.151515151515151
8404851,1,B003T04NAG,"Worst Movie I have ever seen.  The movie is dubbed, Jackie Chan has about 2 minutes in the film.  At first, I thought this might be some kind of cult film, but there isn't anything redeemable about this film.",1474329600,,208,4.3076923076923075
8404852,3,B003T04NAG,"Let's be frank, the majority of the film is quite boring and unfulfilling. Yet, Jackie steals the show in the few scenes he has. Jackie's fight at the beginning of the film is entertaining and his fight at the end is snappily choreographed. The best scene, however, is when Jackie explains to the kid that the kid and his fellow students are the future of China and he needs to improve his grades so he can succeed. Normally, this type of talk would come off as preachy in a film but Jackie says it in such a subtle way that you can roll with it. All Chan fans should see this film solely for Jackie's role. Jackie and the kid take a picture together. The result of this picture creates motivation for our teenage hero which leads to a satisfying ending. This dvd has the film dubbed in English with the option to watch it in the original language. The box art is fine but a little hokey. The picture quality is good considering it looks like it was filmed with a soap opera camera or a video camera. Recommended.",1469232000,,1013,4.336842105263158
8404853,5,B003T04NAG,A very good dvd.,1449100800,,16,3.25
8404854,1,B003T04NAG,"This is THE WORST movie I have EVER seen. Jackie Chan should kick his own ass for this misleading movie. Aside of cameos by Jackie and a couple of other stars, this is a STEAMING PILE OF CRAP, and should be avoided like the plague. Purchase at your own risk!",1448236800,,258,4.18
8404855,1,B003T04NAG,Of you are looking for a good Jackie Chan movie this is not it if he's in it 2 minutes that's alot not worth the $ I enjoy Jackie Chan movies but it was a story about a boy who wanted to meet his idol so definitely don't buy,1436745600,,224,3.5918367346938775
8404856,1,B003T04NAG,"One would think with Jackie Chan big picture on the front would mean he's the star, but after the first 5 minutes, well lets just say he turns into a magician and pulls a disappearing act. The movie feels like it was made by some Chinese high schoolers and Jackie's appearance was more of a moral support. Dumb plot, dumb acting, and dumb filming..",1435968000,,348,4.453125
8404857,5,B003T04NAG,okay movie.,1416182400,,11,5.0
