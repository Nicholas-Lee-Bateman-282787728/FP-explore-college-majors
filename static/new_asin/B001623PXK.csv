8260703,1,B001623PXK,What a disappointing VHS tapes. It is only 28 minutes and it cost me 49 dollars.  Information was shallow and has very little depth.  I was expecting at least 60 minutes like the PBS American Visions Series.  I don't understand why this VHS tapes was so much money. Absolutely disappointed.,1503705600,,290,4.76
