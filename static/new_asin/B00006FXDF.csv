7968439,4,B00006FXDF,"I bought the collection of dvd's just for some episodes about raptors. Guess what? You can find all the most fascinating episodes with velociraptors and ortodones only on the VHS. I was like WTF? Can't they publish those series on dvd? HELLOO! I am the fan of the ''PALEOWORLD''. BUT we don't use VHS's anymore. Publish those series on DVD or blue-ray! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!

Update:

I bought this NOT EVEN  of the collection, on August 31, 2008. Now it is 30th of June 2014. They did not bother to update the DVD collection and add the rest of the missing episodes. MORE THAN HALF OF THE COLLECTION IS MISSING!!! Shame on you all! I love ''Paleoworld'' and I hate this little of the dvd collection.

Update 2:
I can help share other episodes, but I need these ones:

If anyone has them, please write in comments and press a tick to get notified on ''new comments being posted''. Then we will find a way to communicate outside of amazon. If you have those series PLEASE do share them. They are impossible to find. Believe me, because every single year I do the same routine and waste what seems like an entire day on searching for these specific episodes. I never find anything. If you can find it in any language, but with watchable quality, please share. If you have this show on TV, you must record it. No one else has it. The show is one of the best. It's fantastic. It can be a little outdated, but if you seen at least 1 episode , you know then how awesome, how fantastic this show is. I purchased the set and I have other videos on my pc, so I have nearly the complete collection. I can help out anyone who is interested. It's a shame that these guys won't release the whole thing, but just giving a taste of it. I will not wait for anything from then, not anymore. I've waited since 2008. ENOUGH! Help me out and I'll help you out! That's a promise and I always keep my word. But in the end, I will ask you if that will be possible to help me share these episodes with others, people like us. Thank you in advance. And I know that this update is not much of a review, but I am sure many of you tried to search for Paleoworld and found little to nothing, so you came here to this page. Best of luck to us all.
And if you find it in any language, please do share anyway. Me or other people can make subtitles later on.",1227830400,9,2668,4.326653306613227
