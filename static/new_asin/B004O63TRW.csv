4436692,5,B004O63TRW,"In my opinion, ""Ju-On White Ghost/Black Ghost"" was much better than ""Ju-On 2"" It was interesting to see how the stories tied together, much more cohesive than the aforementioned movie. Definitely worth the money!",1348012800,,212,5.264705882352941
4436693,5,B004O63TRW,"I just watched this movie on Netflix.com and I loved it. I really liked both the White and Black Ghosts Stories, but I think the better of the two is the Black Ghost story. I definetly would tell someone who wants to see this movie it is worth the price to buy or rent. This movie gave me chills all the way to the very end.",1343606400,,324,3.9242424242424243
4436694,5,B004O63TRW,"As far as the condition of the DVD and the case I am extremely pleased the only thing is that I wish I would have watched a little closer to order the english version of the movie, lol,  But I have to say that the disk and the time it took for me to recieve it,, I am extremely pleased with so I have to give the seller and Amazon.com an A+++++  Thank You",1334361600,,355,3.7837837837837838
4436695,5,B004O63TRW,"This one went past the roof when it came to scary (for the white ghost only) and gave me nights of being under the covers in my bed at night.  The white ghost was about scariness, but the black ghost was more of plot and development, which really didn't work too well, but didn't pull the movie down.  When it comes to plot and development, for all 3 movies put together, I give it a C+, but scariness I give an A+ for, that movie didn't fail to impress for the first half when the white ghost was still taking victims.  The black ghost had 3 scary moments maximum, but a bit more plot and development (as already mentioned).
Like the other 2 movies, I'm giving this one a 5/5, not too much to talk about except for how weird the first part is, so I might as well keep that a secret until the movie is watched.  I hope for really great things from any other Ju-on movies that come out.",1330905600,,885,4.127906976744186
4436696,5,B004O63TRW,"First of all, like the other reviewer said, it's NOT a direct continuation of the Kayako/Toshio/Evil Hubby storyline from the originals or the remakes. This is a pair of separate ""side hauntings"" that spread off from the original curse. Sooooo...they ARE connected. I'm sure everyone who's seen the original knows that when someone is killed by the curse they in turn get sucked into it and become evil ghostie/haunters themselves. It spreads like a virus. That's what this is about. Clear enough? Ok.

Like I mentioned in the title, if you know what to expect before watching, they're actually pretty good additions to the J-horror world as well as the Ju-On lore. That said, out of the two separate stories I did think Black Ghost was the better of the two. It had many twists and turns and was much darker and creepier than White Ghost. White Ghost was very fun itself though. I kinda liked the creepy old granny carrying the basketball. She was spooky and a hoot at the same time. LOL. Both installments follow the same ""fractured narrative"" style as the original films btw. If you're not prepared for a non-linear story then you won't enjoy that aspect. It does confuse some people.

Ultimately I can't say if these'll creep YOU out or not. That depends on your own internal fright meter. I personally found this pair of hour long stories to be interesting and creepy enough to be very entertaining. I also knew beforehand what they were about. (I always do my research before buying! Unlike some-- ahem.) Plus, I don't always watch ""horror movies"" for the purpose of being scared. If they're just supernaturally fun and keep my attention then that's fine with me. These were more than adequate for the task. 5 stars from me for the whole package. Gotta bump up that 2 star review to something more fair. Hehe.",1323302400,12,1815,4.722397476340694
4436697,2,B004O63TRW,"I bought this thinking it was a continuation of the Kayako/Toshio story but it turned out to be two different movies on one disk....one called White Ghost, the other called Black Ghost. The story line  described on the back of the case looked very interesting but each film had about 3 different plots going on, none of which related to one another, and the ""ghosts"" weren't Kayako and Toshio at all but two new ones that didn't even hold a candle to the original ghosts. The entire film was a joke; not even scary.",1320537600,4,515,4.4787234042553195
4436698,5,B004O63TRW,"Awesome quality for a great price, thanks xo",1424217600,,44,4.625
4436699,3,B004O63TRW,"Ju-on was typical for  most asian movies of it's type. Innocent people being killed for no other reason than being associated with the cursed house.  Having separated the story into two parts White ghost/Black ghost, might lead you to believe that there is one good and one evil story, but that is not the case, alas the curse must go on.  If you're a  fan of the Juon trilogy, then I say , have at it, but if not,don't expect too much.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm getting tired of these herky-jerky stories that don't make sense, and leave you dangling at the end.  True to for their is the ,creaky spine-chilling voice, and the ghost that pop-out, and from under anything.  Please let this be the end of this series.  I feel they have gone as far as they can go.  I brought mine on-line, so I'm stuck with it, but you still have a choice.  Choose wisely!!  By the way the Black ghost is black, not as in Affro american, but as in color. No explaination given for that either.",1421798400,,978,4.2896174863387975

4436701,4,B004O63TRW,"This franchise scares the *&% out of me but this one was actually interesting. White Ghost was freaky but the Black Ghost was less spooky and kinda concluded the cycle of Ju-on/Grudge, meaning explained the story behind these 6 movies.",1409270400,,235,4.9
4436702,5,B004O63TRW,"I really liked this when I first saw it on Netflix. Same twists and turns that I love with the Asian style of horror. If you like the Ju-On movies, this one is quite different but not in a bad way. New characters and storyline made this stand apart from the original Ju-On, but same suspense and fear as the originals. I watched it twice the day I got it. Love it!",1403136000,,364,4.069444444444445
4436703,5,B004O63TRW,"I don't think my review can do it justice, I say pick it up and watch it for yourself, anyway, here is what I originally wrote on another site:
So, I FINALLY got this movie and I thought it was actually pretty good. There were some minor flaws, but excusable because I think this movie didn't have a high budget, but pretty good entertainment. I picked it up for around $10, definitely a movie I will revisit a few times. The scare factor was there and the camera work made the scare effects work. If the cameraman didn't know what he/she was doing, this movie would not have worked. The Grudge appears many times through the movie, however when you see it, you get just enough to know what is happening. I like how many of the scenes let you know exactly what is going to happen with the proper props. You get to see almost every murder take place, the ones that I consider quite gruesome are shown by the camera moving away from the action and you see what is happening by the movement of the shadows or just enough that you can see an act take place, but will not get disgusted. So, if you have a light stomach for that kind of thing, this movie is definitely good for you if you want to watch a scary movie, but not get grossed out like many American movies do. It seems like the whole movie was filmed raw with very little special effects, so blood shown is accurate by having a few spots here and there where in many Hollywood scary movies people tend to bleed way too much from a paper cut or something silly. The main thing I thought was clever about this movie is that it was shot from many different perspectives and the viewer gets to piece things together as you watch it. In White Ghost for example, you see from a perspective of what seems to be a minor character, but actually has a big reference in the end. As the movie progresses, the perspectives you get directly involve more and closer to The Grudge character. I must say, I was not expecting what I saw in the end. For Black Ghost, I thought it was just a good piece of entertainment. The only thing that would have been nice was is if they had done more with The Grudge character as the black ghost. She appears enough so you know she is there and directly involves with the characters of the film. I don't know, they have this spectacular character to work with, great back story, but wasn't used enough. Black Ghost is basically what The Unborn could have been if The Unborn was actually a good, non-self contradicting movie (based on what my little brother said when he saw it in the theaters, I didn't watch it, but that was his take on it). Final plus point on this movie compared to American scary movies, the characters in the movie are not completely stupid like in many American scary movies. An example would be in American movies, they know they need to flee for their lives because of zombies or a curse or whatever following them, but wait, minor character leaves some pointless object he/she can easily live without, but go back to get it anyway and die. In this movie, the characters may not be aware of The Grudge's existence around them, but don't make stupid mistakes.
I say definitely give this movie a chance if you don't have a problem reading subtitles and don't mind lower budget films. Also, I wouldn't categorize this movie under horror, I would put it under suspense/thriller.
Also, as a bonus, they make a few references to the original Ju-On movies, see if you can spot them. The weird white/cat/ghost baby character from Ju-On... 1...? is in the movie, but seems to play no major role and is only in it for a few seconds in both films.
*About this film's rating, in America, it is not rated, but would probably be PG-13 or R, in Canada, it is rated 14+, in Japan, it is rated R-15, in Korea, it is rated 18+, and as far as Europe goes, I found no information as it may never have been released there. I suggest the audience be at least 16 or older to watch this movie. This language is Japanese 5.1 DTS and Japanese 2.0 Stereo. The subtitles for this particular version is English only or no subtitles. There are no other subtitles languages, sadly, it didn't even have Japanese subtitles.
*EDIT: I have a friend in Tokyo who I will discuss this movie further and others in the series to see if their are some cultural differences other nationalities like Americans may not get and post what I find out about here.",1388793600,5,4416,4.3931623931623935
4436704,5,B004O63TRW,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but its not the goriest or bloodiest horror movie made but it does freak me out, but I love it.",1380326400,,137,3.7586206896551726
4436705,4,B004O63TRW,"This is a review for ""White Ghost"" only. The thing that bothered me was the grandmother holding the basketball. While I can see how this element fit into the plot ... it was a distraction more than anything else. Extremely graphic in some parts. I'll definitely never watch this again as ""Ju-On The Curse"" has better plot with less gore",1375315200,,336,4.616666666666666
4436706,4,B004O63TRW,"Ju-on: White Ghost and Black Ghost are the continuation of the Ju-on franchise, although they are not directly related to the original installments. White Ghost tells of a young man that brutally murders his family, then kills himself; Black Ghost tells of a young girl who, after fainting and receiving several medical tests, finds out she has a cyst in her body, which is actually her twin sister. The stories are a bit more complicated, but I'll leave it at that. Ju-on: White Ghost/Black Ghost is a creepy and effective horror film.

The stories in this film use the same formula as the original films; it uses creepy visuals, eerie sounds (the iconic croaking sounds makes a return), and loud jump-scares to create an effective horror atmosphere/mood. Additionally, this is the most violent and disturbing entry in the series- from the brutal stabbings to the implied pedophilia. After the recent disappointing entries in this franchise (ahem, The Grudge 2 and 3), the return to the original formula is welcomed. The storytelling is still a bit confusing- it really leaves you asking questions until the end, as the film skips around from character to character; part of me enjoys the direct focus on a specific character's story, but it feels a bit sloppy or overly complicated. I think the storytelling issue will be a more significant to those that aren't familiar with this style. The acting was good throughout the film, about what you'd expect from a low budget j-horror film.

I own the Blu-ray of this film. Both films run at about an hour each, and both share the same disc. The Blu-ray picture and sound quality is fine, basically standard. The film has English subtitles, it does not have an English dub. The blu-ray does not have special features.

Overall, Ju-on: White Ghost/Black Ghost is a creepy, unsettling j-horror film, and a great return to what made the originals iconic. The Blu-ray version of this film isn't a must own, unless your a blu-ray collector. A purchase is recommended for fans of the genre and franchise, a rental otherwise.

This film has strong violence and gore.",1362700800,2,2106,4.890756302521009
4436707,1,B004O63TRW,"It has the looking of a really, really bad college made movie.  The costumes were atrocious.  The acting was horrible.  I couldn't sit through either of the movies in its entirety not worth renting or buying",1354752000,,207,4.694444444444445
