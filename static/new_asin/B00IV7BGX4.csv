8645625,2,B00IV7BGX4,"Thought it was more about IH tractors but it didn't cover much about the tractors of the era, it just covered other things that was boring, just wasn't what we thought it would be.",1488931200,,180,4.323529411764706

8645627,2,B00IV7BGX4,I'm so disappointed.  I bought this DVD as a gift for my husband thinking it was about Farmall tractors.  There are hardly any tractors at all and all about IH advertising and home appliances.  It's very misleading.,1451692800,,215,4.756756756756757

8645629,2,B00IV7BGX4,"I expected the movie to be more about farm tractors and equipment  by looking at the cover photo. Was more about I.H. as a company promotion and it's refrigerators, bulldozers etc. It was sort of entertainingly funny to see the old infomercials and the advertisements from the 50's.",1433635200,,282,4.875

8645631,3,B00IV7BGX4,Soundtrack YUK.  Some good content but the sound editing and noise (annoying music) could be a form of torture.,1427760000,,111,4.842105263157895

8645633,5,B00IV7BGX4,"If you like farm equipment, especially antique tractors, this DVD is great! Even if you don't enjoy equipment so much, there is a lot to learn about farming and farming techniques that still amkes these videos fun to watch. My whole family enjoyed watching this!",1427068800,,262,4.844444444444444
