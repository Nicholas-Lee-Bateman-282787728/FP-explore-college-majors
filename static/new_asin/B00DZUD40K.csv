Its a bit ""Wholesome Family show"" so I can only handle watching one ep at a time, but that's kinda good as it means I won't rush though it, the Interview was nice. but I couldn't have seen the show getting a 3rd season or much further as it did start getting pretty same-y ""Whats that Ben ? GGRAHHHH, oh its a fire/flood/someone we don't know etc, oh look here's Mad Jack and Nakoma to help, we gotta save the critters, lets eat some flapjacks or Pancakes etc etc""",1361836800,2,610,4.083333333333333

5880563,5,B00DZUD40K,I bought this DVD set for my parents. They love Grizzly Adams. They have not found a season 2 set at this great price. They were amazed when they found out how much I paid (I'm a prime member). They arrived on time and in perfect shape. They said it's a very cute show with animals that kids and adults would love. They are going to loan the dvds to us after they are finished watching them.,1463702400,,391,4.090909090909091

This set was on 4 discs as well, but they shoved 24 shows on 4 discs! The Picture Quality blurry & distorted!  When You get to the last show on disk 4, Once upon a starry night, the show's picture was so badly, blurry & distorted that it gave me a headache just watching it. It was far worse then the rest! Come on Shout Factory-Timeless Media, would it have broken your bank, to have put Season 2, on 6 or 8 dvd's? You screwed Your costumers! You know the ones that made You rich!!! I would have gladly given an extra $10.00 for a few extra discs, so the picture would have looked as good as season 1.

5880571,3,B00DZUD40K,"I really like the Grizzly Adams shows as they brings back fond memories of younger days watching the shows as a kid, so yes they are nice, but the clarity of the dvd/videos are definately like they were back in the late 70's as well.  Clearly not designed for today's high resolution TV's that's for sure as they appear to be dvd's of well used episode copied while on screen. Low pixel that's for sure.  If you expect to see what you saw as a kid in the 70's as far as resolution/clarity wise that is what you should expect to see.  The episodes are as I remember and have good moral values being taught in the shows.  Subject matter of the shows are very good to teach the young. Good clean entertainment with good values, but the drawback is back in the 70's film resolution was definately not like it is now days.",1455667200,2,817,4.285714285714286

5880589,5,B00DZUD40K,"The second and last season of one of my favorite shows. The older I get, the more I realize what a lucky generation I was privileged to be a child in. One reason was for the great TV we had. This was one of those shows. There was a movie called Grizzly Adams from 1974 that was so well received that they finally made a TV show out of it. Whereas most of those kind of shows I've seen flopped, this one did very well. I believe it was number one in it's time slot both seasons. I know we watched it in my house when I was in  kindergarten and first grade. This show was a replacement show for another series that got cancelled early. Funny how that happens, sometimes. 'The Invaders' from the late 1960's was another replacement show that aired and was a big hit.

  Season two was longer than season 1 since it got a full season instead of being a replacement. The episodes were not as interesting, in general, as the first season in my opinion. I think season one was better. Still better than most anything on TV today, though. There were more subplots in this season, interestingly. They were using Denver Pyle more than they did in season one, more than one episode almost all about his activities. There were some interesting things that happen in season two. A young Theodore Roosevelt comes around learning to survive in the mountains. One of the Wright brothers is up there testing flying equipment, a hot air balloon is shot down and has to land. Those were interesting, but I wanted to see more mountain oriented episodes. My only disappointment with this season was one episode where they feature this stupid monkey. Come on! They're up in the mountains and the writers have run out of ideas to the point they have to bring in some monkey? That was the only episode I thought was stupid. One interesting thing happened this season. In almost every other episode of both seasons, Nakoma speaks the Crow language exclusively. On one episode in this season, there is this Indian boy featured. He apparently does not speak a native language, at least not Crow. I thought it was funny that this was the only episode where Nakoma spoke English, and it was to communicate with this Indian kid! I was LOL.

  I agree with some other reviewers that the episodes not being featured in order was kind of annoying but not really a problem Maybe on the first season discs when the show is just getting started and the characters meeting each other it's important, but for the most part the episodes are stand alone. Kind of strange they did not compile them in order, though, how hard would that have been? Audio and visual quality about the same as season one, good overall but definitely not remastered. You also get the TV movie 'Once Upon A Starry Night' which I now watch every Christmas. You also get an interview with Dan Haggerty on this set.

  No nudity, sexual innuendo, hard core violence, political correctness, ridiculous unbelievable characters or situations. Allegedly there is supposed to be a new Grizzly Adams show being made soon. I won't hold my breath waiting to see some quality, but who knows. I guess they'll have to have a black Jack, female bounty hunters, an oriental herbalist trader and some illegal mexicans leaving garbage all over the mountain and living 20 in a cabin they stole from someone and one pair of any of those characters will be gay for each other. It'll be Grizzly Adams' Brokeback Mountain. They will live on an EPA approved plot of land, have episodes where they protect the cryptobiotic soil from mountain bikers, and Jack will store his rifle in a cabinet with the shot and powder stored in a separate lock box.

  Enjoy this while it's out, it may not be here a long time. After all the seasons of the Daniel Boone show came out in the early 2000's, they stopped printing them and now used sets are going for hundreds of dollars. Sergeant Preston of the Yukon is that way too, and others.",1437264000,5,3938,4.553041018387553

When old man Jack starts each episode writing down Adams' adventures and that song begins to play I sit down and I'm taken back to when I was 7 and 8 years old.

Not only is this film inspiring, heart-warming but it also features different situations regarding history that makes it fun for kids! The movie will inspire you to be outside in the wilderness enjoying God's creation, as well as natural eating and getting back to the roots of a healthy lifestyle! The show features survival, friendship, wilderness, redemption, and many more great topics! I rate this very high for the family that wants to sit around and watch something wholesome, what today's TV lacks! Sit back, grab a drink, some popcorn and take several great adventures with the ""The Life and Time of Grizzly Adams, Season 1 and 2) wrap it up with the movie, which we loved, but it didn't feature Mad Jack, or Nakoma, which I believe were probably busy during the time of filming.",1401062400,,851,4.795918367346939

However, I have nieces and nephews I can introduce this too that are young enough to enjoy it.  I am disappointed by how sketchy and sometimes a little blurry the picture is though. I guess the older the movie, the harder it is to convert to DVD for clear viewing. Big Disappointment there. Now, if SOMEONE could just get Don Shanks in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" on to DVD... I'm still looking for that one. This is still good enough to purchase though.",1398988800,,576,4.236363636363636

Added it to our collection of Little House, Brady Bunch, Gilligan, MacGyver.  No influence on my kids of kids' snotty attitudes towards their parents, over-sexual or hyped-up characters.  At times it does seem to go over the top with the ""green"" theme.  As stated in other reviews the episodes are not in the order that they were aired which is a little strange.

5880649,5,B00DZUD40K,"As the bringer of solutions where a pleasant outcome always prevails Grizzly Adams shows are not only reassuring but mighty entertaining as well.

This second season as the first one was, based on a stirring message of appreciation and respect for Mother Earth and its many creatures, is a total ecological and drama success.

The story of Grizzly Adams includes an educational message of respect for all of nature and its cute creatures, actually these shows are as a cold shower, the opposite of what is termed so-called reality; competition, greed, toxic waste, etc; all in disregard for Mother Earth, and its creatures including other humans.

Then we have Denver Pyle, or Mad Jack, as the second dog on the show who delivers an amusing routine worthy of an Emmy award.  Jack obviously enjoys putting up a rough front yet behind that roughness we can see there is a gentle, caring man.

These great televisions series, based on the life of a real nineteen century woodsman who found refuge from civilization in the Sierra Nevada mountains and who also raised and trained Grizzly bears and other wild animals, are highly recommended.",1385424000,2,1136,4.9267015706806285

The actual dvd leaves a few things to be desired. It is obvious that it is the original content and has not been updated  at all. You can tell some of the film that was copied was older. Although there is a list of episodes on each disc there is no way to know which order overall that they were broadcast, as the discs are not numbered.

5880660,2,B00DZUD40K,"Enjoyed this show immensely as a 12 year old, and the theme is an admirable one. Life in the wilderness and respect for nature and animals are strong points for showing this to children. For adults however this series is seriously dated and too slow paced and
just not enough exciting content or dialog to keep most of us awake. No harmful content at all, very mild throughout, little ones will love the cute animals often depicted, although in a somewhat repetitive manner, with many shots either reused or similar cropping up constantly. If the slow pace doesn't bother you and the lack of detail..meaning there are many survival techniques used in the show that are not properly demonstrated or explained, only occasionally, if the storyline demanded it. A more involved script would have helped, maybe a remake someday..that would be a hit I think. I am fairly tolerant with my viewing but too dull for me, view but don't buy until you have, would be my advice.",1370563200,,965,4.75

You get 4 discs and if your kids play with them and put them back in the wrong order then you will not know what order to watch in.  I guess to some degree it doesn't matter since these are not like a continuing story from episode to episode, but to some degree it does matter in my opinion especially when new characters are introduced etc.
my 6 year old is really enjoying these.  with all the garbage on tv today, it is really nice to have some wholesome tv to share with her.  she was a little scared at some of the show content at first (like wild animals attacking or little kids getting lost in the wild) but we assured her it would all turn out alright, and the animals were all friendly.
