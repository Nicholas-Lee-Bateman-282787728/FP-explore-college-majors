1908456,5,B0000AMKI5,"This is the video to get if you are unsure of your roll.  It provides slow motions that take you through every aspects of the sweep and C-to-C roll.
Even if you have a roll, this video can help you remove those bad habits that make a roll seemed strained.",1061510400,,255,4.1
1908457,4,B0000AMKI5,"Simply stated, if you want to learn how to roll a WW kayak, go no further than this video.  It breaks down the roll into its component parts, both for instruction before the fact and diagnosis & corrections after the fact.  It pinpoints all the little nuances of this necessary WW skill, right down to hand and eye positions, and does so in a fashion that is upbeat and inspiring.  You want to run right out to the pool and practice! That the video features average people - not kayak superstars - permits the viewer to relate to each scene.  My fiance and I both learned to roll 100% from viewing this video, over and over.  We continue to use it as a reference tool, and have lent it to other people wanting to get into WW kayaking.  Buy it - it's cheaper than a... private lesson, and just as effective, since you can repeat it as often as you want/need.",1032912000,18,857,4.291925465838509
1908458,5,B0000AMKI5,"I have struggled for years trying to roll my kayak reliably.  With this video, several sessions at the lake, doing one step at a time, I did it!",1182124800,,144,4.142857142857143
1908459,4,B0000AMKI5,"When learning the kayak roll, one of the most difficult things is to visualize what your body is supposed to be doing in 3-d, while your reference frame is turning! The video really helps with that. I flailed around for two days of rolling lessons in a pool until I got the idea that your knee is really the thing that helps you perform the ""hip-snap"" to turn you over, which my teachers weren't telling me but which the video stressed. Recommended.",1172102400,3,449,4.487804878048781
1908460,5,B0000AMKI5,This video helped clear up quit a few misconceptions I had about the Kayak roll. IF you have already had a roll class this video is a grate reminder tool. This video reinforced the instruction given in the Kayak roll class I took at a local educational institute.  Be Good and Have fun.,1168387200,,286,4.39622641509434
1908461,5,B0000AMKI5,I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to roll. It teaches a basic roll and breaks it down into its different components.,1162598400,2,139,4.6
1908462,5,B0000AMKI5,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the good reviews of this product were true.  This roll worked for me pretty much right away, albeit with some paddle float practice first.

I do think they should have mentioned paddle float use in the video.  It helps to build the muscle memory required to get this roll to work.  However, the roll does feel very different without the float of course.  Use your best judgement.

I also found that I had to move fairly slowly in order to get my sea kayak to come up.  This roll still works if you slow down quite a bit.

Trust the sweep - water becomes like rock when that paddle is moving.",1158796800,5,635,4.277310924369748
1908463,3,B0000AMKI5,"After watching this video about 5 times and after already having taken a certified rolling class twice before, successfully I might add, I went out with my kayak to a lake, sure that I could easily pull this roll off; after all, they make it look so easy in the video, and, I've rolled before.  Well, there I was underwater realizing I must have forgotten something because it was NOT anywhere near as easy as in the video.  Two reasons are: 1)it is incredibly disorientating upside down and 2)the video is never taken from the kayaker's perspective, but from a person looking at the kayaker, so you get a mirror effect.

Two weeks later I took another rolling class, this time a private lesson from a certified instructor.  This time he had me use my greenland paddle and do a ""pawlata"" roll, which is best for beginners.  During the lesson I rolled successfully three times.  So, my recommendation would be to rent this video and watch it, but then get instruction somewhere from someone who knows what they're doing.  Rolling is sort of like learning to ride a bike, but in this case, a unicycle.  It takes lots of practice and having an instructor is preferred.  The video itself recommends that you get an instructor.",1156809600,9,1222,4.6465116279069765
1908464,5,B0000AMKI5,"All of the reviews seem to agree that this is an excellent instructional video.  I concur, I would just like to add that in addition to being an effective style of roll, it is also VERY easy on your shoulders.

After a few seasons of failure and shoulder pain attempting to do a C-to-C roll I plunked down the money for this video.  It was well worth it.  It still took a few sessions to master (mainly just forcing myself to do what the video tells me to do!) but I now have a solid, trustworthy roll, and don't really have pain in my shoulders.  It's true, once you have a roll your confidence and ability really starts to improve.",1124496000,7,633,4.241666666666666
1908465,5,B0000AMKI5,"I finally picked this DVD up a year ago, watched it a couple times through last winter.  Got it out in early spring, watched it again. Went out and still bombed a few attempts. Payed closer attention and within an hour was popping rolls fairly frequently. Excellent teaching tool, by the end of the summer I was rolling on both sides, fully loaded sea kayak. Rough water, cold water. Just put the boat away for the winter two weeks ago, here in MN, no open water left. Last thing I did before the end of the season, a couple of real cold rolls.",1103414400,11,544,4.281553398058253
1908466,5,B0000AMKI5,"I bought this DVD after struggling to learn the roll, and finally learned it on the second pool session after watching it. Before watching the video, I was taught to first learn to bring myself up after a near-capsize using a sweeping brace, which I learned, but then I failed to apply that to the mechanics of the roll when upside-down under water, where all your instincts are the reverse of the correct motions.
This video teaches some exercises to progressively work your way to a full capsize -- first without the paddle and just using your knees. Then the instructor holds you by your lifejacket, with your face just above water, to teach you the sweeping motion of the paddle and the corresponding knee motion.
The video has very good production values, including animation and underwater camera angles. The last half of the video also contains diagnostics for common mistakes, and teaches you how to instruct others on doing the roll.
It was mostly filmed in a slow-moving river with whitewater kayaks, but also shows some sea-kayak-specific scenes, and the whole video applies to either form of kayaking. It even has some pretty amazing footage of kayakers riding some pretty serious ocean surf.",1089936000,25,1204,4.9068627450980395
7997732,5,B0000AMKI5,"This is the best roll video out there, period.  You'll learn a sweep roll from some excellent teachers in a manner that keeps you from being injured, makes sense and is easy to learn.  Troubleshooting tips are included in the video and you can watch it over and over to fine tune your roll or readjust if you've lost your roll.  Great camera angles and shots with a cut-out kayak give you a view you don't see anywhere else.  Highly recommended.",1484265600,,445,4.45679012345679
7997733,5,B0000AMKI5,"If ever something needs hands-on instruction and close, objective, observational feedback, it's rolling a kayak. The movements are complex, subtle and counterintuitive, your orientation changes throughout and you're underwater half the time so it's hard for you or even a casual observer to see what you're doing. So I was mightily impressed by this video, which uses detailed explanations and illustrations, including hands-on (simulated) instruction, to promote a single, all-purpose, reliable, adaptable and fairly safe roll technique. Instead of demonstrating numerous variations or supposedly inspirational advanced rolls, which is all pointless distraction, this team teaches the movements, timing and attitude that directly informs beginners. They know their stuff, both how to do it and how to communicate it, and they've honed their craft to concentrate on the essentials. The result is still a lot to absorb, sitting indoors, then put into practice in the water, but given its inherent limitations this video does a fantastic job. Many viewings interspersed with lots of practice still isn't quite like having someone standing beside you showing you on the spot what's right and wrong, leading you along step by step, but it's the next best thing. Pretty soon you'll hear their voices while you're upside down: ""shed the resistance"", ""torso rotation"", ""elbow forward"", ""head down"", ""watch the watch"" and most of all their calm confidence that, strung together and executed reasonably competently, these motions will succeed in righting you with very little effort. They still recommend personal instruction (it's what they do for a living, after all), but this video is a great alternative, and a great commercial for their school.",1478390400,,1741,5.5
7997734,5,B0000AMKI5,great video....still learning but I have watched it several times and I always see something I missed.,1414281600,,102,5.0588235294117645
7997735,5,B0000AMKI5,"Sure it's a bit outdated, but that's half the fun! :)  The content is fantastic.  I have watched quite a few rolling DVDs (repeatedly), such as Erik Jackson's and Ken Whiting's, but this is my new favorite.  It teaches a somewhat different style than the others, and acknowledges this in the video.  I think the more ways you can roll the better, so having another style in my 'bag of tricks' is nice.  Get a copy ASAP!",1400457600,,419,4.3896103896103895
7997736,4,B0000AMKI5,Working to learn rolling at age 66 was a challenge for my brain.  I found this video helpful in visualizing myself underwater and somewhat turned around.  I took several in-pool classes and combined cues from this video and two instructors in putting it together.,1396828800,,263,4.954545454545454
7997737,5,B0000AMKI5,"I ordered this video the day before I hit my face on a rock and got 8 stitches all because of a missed roll ... a little foreshadowing? I watched this video today, went out into the river to practice and bam! I'm back.  Of course I've been collecting and practicing a whole host of bad habits all summer long which finally culminated in the complete destruction of my previously bomb proof roll.  I can't believe how thorough this video is.  One video was able to help me discern all the wrong things I was doing -- it is RockStar.  thank you!!!

7997738,5,B0000AMKI5,"This video is fantastic in it's presentation of the kayak roll. It is clear, concise and well documented, reinforced and illustrated. All of the presenters are qualified instructors, and this is the first dvd I have seen that slows the process down and even breaks down each step into a practice. I highly recommend it to anyone who kayaks. You will not roll overnight but you will NOT roll at all without this dvd.",1280102400,,415,4.621621621621622
7997739,5,B0000AMKI5,"I've been paddling for a number of years and my only option on a flip had been a wet exit.  Last year I bought my first whitewater kayak (Dagger Mamba 8) and had been using it a lot in the ocean to play in waves.  I then got a sea kayak and had started adventuring more and more out into the ocean, down the beaches, etc.  I had practiced a self rescue using a float and pump so I had that down, but still, a wet exit is just such an ugly option, I had to get my roll down.  It was becoming a real safety concern.  I brought my kayaks to a friend's pool and armed with many hours of Youtube videos and research under my belt I was only able to fully confuse myself and get very angry.  Rolling is impossible!  That was it, I was all ready to sign up for a LL Bean roll clinic, $240.  They pretty much guarantee that by the end of the 4 hour private class, you are gonna have your roll down.

Then suddenly as a gift this video was given to me.  I watched it fully, took what I learned and went into the ocean on a very calm day later that week.  In shallow waters I had a partner do as I instructed (if I tap on the bottom, flip me back up) and I was still having trouble.  I finally said to myself, ""Fine, I'm going to do EXACTLY what they said in the video!"" Bang, I did my first roll.  Then again.  Then I got my 16 foot sea kayak out, first try rolled it.

This DVD not only contains the exact concepts but does a super job at teaching them.  They pound into you over and over the same thing but present these ideas from different angles.  Getting a roll down is just so very counter intuitive, and in the video they say that and then show you what EXACTLY to do.  There are different instructors and they use many different techniques to get the message into your head.  This is the same company that puts out a good Ocean Kayak Surfing video which I already found helpful, this video is even better.  Not only did this DVD save me a bunch of money, it's saved me from many horrid wet exits and who knows what else!",1251763200,,2020,3.9900249376558605
7997740,5,B0000AMKI5,"Just what I wanted - a movie that instructs you how to to the roll in a safe way. I've hurt my shoulder in an other rollstyle, but that isn't a problem any more with this new style.",1220313600,,181,3.789473684210526
7997741,5,B0000AMKI5,"I saw this video at a roll tune-up class and then bought my own copy for review. They teach the ""twist-sweep"" roll which seems safer and more protective of your shoulder than some others. The learning progression is effective and the roll technique focuses on the strength of your torso rather than your arms. I had degenerated from a solid c-to-c roll to something pretty sloppy and this video and a tune up class are helping me get back to something fluid and reliable.

The second half has a lot of diagnostic and corrective hints for ironing out weaknesses in your style.

It definitely helps to have an instructor to help manipulate the paddle and get you to relax your arms and hands on the paddle. The paddle is used mostly as a guide, not as a lever.",1210291200,3,758,4.4855072463768115
