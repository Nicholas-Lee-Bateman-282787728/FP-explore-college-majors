8470351,5,B005FNVBLY,"This is a fantastic DVD.  I bought both the electric and acoustic DVDs by Keith Wyatt and they're both awesome.  Initially, as a beginner I was able to 'copy and play' the notes, but a lot of the theory went over my head, and didn't understand why he's playing those notes.  But as I progressed, I came back to these DVDs several times and I could appreciate it more and more, because I started to understand why he's playing those notes.  And the teaching method is relaxed with a positive vibe... Good job!",1510963200,,508,4.43010752688172
