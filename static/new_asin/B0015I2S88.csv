3145003,5,B0015I2S88,"Transformers animated is better than I expected. This new Transformers animated series is really good! I am suprised that cartoon has references to Transformers: Generation 1! Transform and Roll out is the three-part pilot episodes to Transformers Animated! This Cartoon is really good with references to G1! My only problem with this series the animation is not as good as the past Transformers cartoons. The animation feels more like a copy of Bruce Timm's Batman the animated series rather than being a different animated show. The animations is cute but not better. Despite this, I still like it!  If your a Transformers fan, I highly recommend it! A",1219449600,2,654,5.055555555555555
3145004,5,B0015I2S88,"I just saw yesterday and it's was fun to watch. Excellent way to inntroduce the series and all the new Characters.
Buy in order to get connected with Season 1 that is coming out in Mid Aug.
Fun to Watch for the family and True Transformers fans",1218326400,,244,4.212765957446808
3145005,4,B0015I2S88,"The cult classic ""Transformers"" gets a brand-new look in the new Cartoon Network series ""Transformers Animated"".  Given the success of the hit Transformers movie, I'd say that is the reason why they created this ""Megas XLR"" meets ""Teen Titans"" action series.

The original characters like the Autobots such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, and the Decepticons like Starscream take on new adventures in a futuristic Detroit.  Whether they take on villains as robots or stop them in their tracks in their vehicle modes, you just know it'll get cooler every time.

This DVD has the very first three episodes, which is the ""Transform and Roll Out"" opener.  The Autobots not only attempt to rescue the city, but they have a whole lot to learn about the human world with the help of a little girl named Sari.

So anyway, this is a good DVD to own, but the full complete first season will be released later this summer !  Also keep an eye out for brand new episodes Saturday mornings only on Cartoon Network's Dynamite Action Squad block !",1214265600,6,1038,4.76536312849162
3145006,3,B0015I2S88,"This only contains the first 3 episodes of the series.  Season 1 boxset is coming out on August 19 2008 for about $20, which will include the remaining 13 episodes (episodes 4-16).  These episodes, from what I hear on TFW2005 site says will not be included in the season 1 boxset.

This is a fantastic series, and being a fan of the original, you will notice a lot of references to G1 that casual viewers would miss.  I will not post any of those here as it might be spoilers to those who have not yet seen the series.

I highly recommend viewers to give this series a chance, you will be surprised at how cleaver and entertaining it is.

My 3 star ranking is based on the fact that they are not including extras, and separating the first season into 2 packages instead of releasing them all at once.  The show gets 5 stars.",1214179200,11,824,4.27741935483871
3145007,4,B0015I2S88,"Having seen these episodes in HD widescreen the full frame presentation here is somewhat, well, lacking.

Otherwise Transformers: Animated is a great new retelling of familiar stories with a fresh look and a bit more friendly to the younger crowd. Looking forward to the rest of season 1 in August.",1213660800,4,298,4.96
3145028,5,B0015I2S88,"In truth, at first, I didn't really like this, but being open minded, I decided to give this a chance. After all, I had been hooked by the G1 version, which I loved, and I read various Transformers comics over time, so I have seen different renditions over time, and a different continuity each time. Talk about Universes!
This one has definite tie ins to the G1 universe and it would be easier to think of the G1 characters in much the same way Beast Wars did, as ancestors, and these new characters as their descendants. What I found hard to accept was that Prime, in this universe, is not the Prime his namesake was, in both title and power. Ultra Magnus on the other hand more than lives up to his name. And while the G1 series made Starscream as a dangerous conniving schemer,here he shows far more sinister power,that with just a little extra effort could have easily contended with Megatron, although I was pleased to see,none of the banter was lost. In fact, Tom Kenny does an excellent job in reprising the loveable evil character that Starscream has always been, with the added spice of being truly dangerous. It's too bad it wasn't until the Transformers Movie that we actually got to see Starscream in his truest form, while the Revenge of Bruticus came close. I'm glad I gave this a chance. It was fun, and I would recommend it.",1279152000,,1341,4.522633744855967
3145029,5,B0015I2S88,"Right. I'm a huge Transformers nerd: have been since 1984.  This show got a lot of derision from the TF community for...the chins.  Seriously.  They look way more cartoony and anime-influenced than previous Transformers continuities.

That being said, I love it.  The Autobots aren't trained warriors, but are a ragtag crew of repair technicians, who get tossed into a fight way bigger than they can handle.  The first season has some human villain bits that annoy some fans, but they're clever and creative and very fun take-offs on traditional 'supervillains'.

The writing is superb, and the humor is well balanced--there's nothing 'adult' about it, but there are things an adult can watch and find funny without feeling like they've had to ratchet their brain down to second grade.  There are also plenty of cheeky references to G1 (the original Transformers series) in cameos, etc.

All in all, a solid, family friendly cartoon series about robots that's engaging, funny, and cute!",1268697600,,986,5.1125

This is an awesome DVD 3 episode movie that gives the classic G1 characters such as Optimus Prime,Bumblebee,Starscream,and Megatron a more futuristic look with amazing action scenes and a very good storyline to really open the series up for alot of compelling plots and thrills along the way. Bumblebee gives you a reminder of the G1 version,but with alot more attitude and sleek look. Optimus grows more as a leader through the movie with the outstanding qualitys we all admire Optimus for. Prowl is really cool in this series with samurai fighting skills that make him a stealthy decepticon assain. Ratchet is his usual classic self with improved vital medical skills while Bulkhead is pretty much a big wrecking bot with a heart of gold. This is a great series kickstart that is perfect for transformer fans of all ages. Bottom line Transformers Animated Transform and Roll Out is a cool,action packed,thrill ride that is an awesome addition for all transformer DVD collections out there.
