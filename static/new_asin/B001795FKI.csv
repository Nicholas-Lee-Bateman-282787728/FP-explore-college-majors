8265437,1,B001795FKI,"All 3 of Julius dvds are crap. He talks too much, and keeps talking of concepts rather than teach drills and various techniques.he also keeps flinching during moves as if he is expecting to get hit. That is so irritating. Even my wife commented on that although she doesn't practice arnis eskrima.
Then he has these huge two apes as his partners who look like duhs or Shrek who keep pretending as if they are in pain and also keep grinning to someone off the set.
I bought these three videos from blackbeltmag.com and not from amazon.
All the 4 clowns in these videos which includes a weak looking female are dressed to kill with waist scarves with their names on them and some weird emblazoned forearm sleeve which has no purpose whatsoever. You would think it provides some protection during practice but it obviously doesn't because you often see Julius pulling it up so it's obvious it's not designed to protect.
Melegrito also keeps throwing in the cops into his ramblings and it seems to me it was to impress.
Don't waste your money on these bulls*** videos. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. And don't believe the guy who have the 5-star rating.",1427155200,2,1156,4.616504854368932
8265438,5,B001795FKI,"I know that nothing replaces a one on one instructor, but lets face facts, not everyone can afford, or even find a qualified teacher anywhere near them.  This helps a great deal.  Buy it, watch it, practice the moves... and you will improve.  I recommended this DVD to all of the Women/girls that take my self-defense classes.  It gives them insights especially when used with Krav Maga and improvisational weapons training, just substitute knives... you get the picture... Women afraid to talk to, be touched by, or learn from a Male?  Buy this series and try it..... it helps when you can fight back....",1403049600,4,605,4.778846153846154
8265439,5,B001795FKI,Excellent for entry level knife confidence! Number system and non-lethal options are discussed. Plus his training partners are fun to watch. Salamat Po Mr. Melegrito,1306627200,4,165,5.64
