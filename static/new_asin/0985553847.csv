174626,5,0985553847,"Intelligent, informed discussion about public education is hard to find.  To address this, several educators and researchers organized two conferences  one in Maine (August, 2012) and one in Georgia (August, 2013)  to explain their various insights and concerns.  These talks were then organized into an eight-disk DVD set, 'Exposing the Global Road to Ruin Through Education', which is available for sale on Amazon.com

Charlotte Iserbyt, President of 3D Research Co. and author of the Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, was one of the projects principle organizers.  Iserbyt was a senior policy advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration, where she had access to documents that increasingly caused her concern.

One of the interesting insights revealed by these documents, educator Samuel L. Blumenfeld writes in the forward to Iserbyts opus magnum, referring not only to what crossed Iserbyts desk at OERI but what she subsequently amassed over the next 25 years, is how the social engineers use a deliberately created education crisis to move their agenda forward by offering radical reforms that are sold to the public as fixing the crisis  which they never do.  The new reforms simply set the stage for the next crisis, which provides the pretext for the next move forward.

There is far too much material in these eight disks to review with any justice.  In the first conference, Iserbyt opens with an historical and ideological overview of education since 1940.  She is followed by Cindy Weatherly, who gives a riveting talk about the complicity of conservative forces that are promoting progressive education reform.  Other speakers discuss the problems of charter schools, the significance of educating for a global workforce, issues of illiteracy, and the politics of sustainability.

The 2013 conference is every bit as interesting, focusing more narrowly on specific efforts to transform education, synthesized into a slogan, limited learning for lifelong labor.  Jeannie Georges talk about outcome based education, a process developed by Marxist psychologists, speaks to the very essence of Common Core and a managed workforce.

Weatherly addressed the move from competency-based education to outcome-based including psychological and attitudinal profiles of each student.  She expresses concern that profit-making entities increasingly expect tax-supported public schools to send them trained workers who are given limited education that locks them into employment choices.

There is much more discussion about pseudo-conservative representation, social engineering, and the objectives, having little to do with traditional educational objectives.  These are thoughtful, deeply-researched presentations by people who have spent many years gathering evidence for their positions.  They draw extensively from source documents  government handbooks, tests that have been administered in various school districts, and the writing of reformers whose theories are very much driving current programs.

There is also a section in which activists from various states describe how they are informing their legislators and fellow citizens and Iserbyt concludes the conference with strategies on how to reclaim our educational system.  She begins by holding up a page titled Flow Chart of Educational Process and Needs that has been taken from a 1968 position paper for Chicago inner-city schools. It shows that the school is to be organized in such a way that teachers, students, and communities having certain characteristics will be changed to have new, more desirable characteristics.

Who are the individuals deciding what these desirable characteristics are to be?  They aren't the students parents or even religious leaders or the community itself but are entities outside the community.  To her, this is a wonderfully graphic example of the movement toward collectivism that concerns the activists presenting the Global Road to Ruin through Education project.  Authentic research (such as provided by this graphic and the wealth of other material included in the disk sense) is the cornerstone of any action plan to take back our educational systems.

She warns against joining groups and movements (easily manipulated from the outside) but to instead share information, individual by individual, especially with ones elected officials, ones educators, and local businesspeople.  Iserbyt also proposes a number of specific actions such as restoring the Family, Education, and Privacy Act so that personal data about students cannot be inappropriately accessed and returning education to local control; among other things.

The final disk in the set presents 250 pages of supplementary print materials  articles and charts that can be printed for distribution as needed, covering many of the same topics as the conferences.  Taken all together, this video set provides an invaluable toolkit for anyone concerned about the direction education has headed.  Quoting one blogger, If you think you are too small to be effective, you have never been in bed with a mosquito.",1390780800,2,5174,5.600770218228498
174627,5,0985553847,"If it is not already apparent to you from what we see  going on in education today, you must watch these presentations to find out. From researchers to teachers who experienced the 'change', you will get a wide view of the forces acting upon our government through the control of the generations coming through the public school  system.

Since the birth of our country, there are forces who have used our children as political mules for their own purposes. Never before has this been so blatant with the likes of Common Core. But make no mistake about it, the process has been going on for a very long time.  It is deliberate and by stealth, and often takes the form of standards and goals imposed by the federal government.

Bottom line is, in order to maintain the sovereignty and hard-fought independence of our country our children must learn proper history, and must not be brainwashed into thinking the UN is our government, or that our Constitution is dead. Socialism is not the answer but if this is not stopped, that is where we are heading.

For years taxpayers and parents have given radicals like William Ayers free access to our schools. It mattered not which party was in power, they kept working at their agenda until we have come to this point of dire straights.

Whether you have children or not, please wake up to what is going on or there will be no country left.",1388966400,12,1383,4.597560975609756

You can not go forward if you do not understand the past, otherwise you are condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past. These DVD's give a clear understanding of Who and Why education was and is designed to fail. Limiting Freedom and controlling people can only happen with re-education.  Once Americans realize that education is big business and the schemes were put in place to control not educate, then and only then will changes be made.  This DVD set is step one.

More of the same - more control, more wasted money.  Perhaps they are actually achieving their hidden goal - dumbing down America.

174630,5,0985553847,Exposing the Global Road to Ruin through Education is highly recommended for all teachers who want to understand what has happened to their profession and why their lessons are scripted to produce desired outcomes on standardized tests.  This series of DVDs is highly recommended for all administrators who wish to understand why they find themselves in this matrix of perpetual testing and conforming to ever increasing state and federal standards.  It is highly recommended for Superintendents who want to understand why their schools are suddenly failing and facing sanctions.  It is highly recommended for parents to understand why their children are totally stressed out and not enjoying school.  Charlotte Iserbyt has dedicated her life to getting the information out so these issues can be understood and people can begin to take action.  You owe it to yourself to learn how you can begin to fight back and reclaim your neighborhood schools.,1388793600,15,948,5.251655629139073
174631,5,0985553847,"""Exposing the Global Road to Ruin Through Education"" is a must for every person in this country.  In order to understand the true impetus of Common Core, you must first learn the history. Common Core is not new. The failed standards based system is documented throughout these presentations by researchers across the United States that love this country. The bigger plan is to change our system of government. Common Core is the stepping stone to individualize and personalize education for every individual student, similar to the Obamacare individual mandate. It is a power shift away from local control. The crushing of the public school system in this country and teaching academics will give way to global workforce training, charter school takeover with unelected school boards, and the federal choice legislation under the Re-Authorization of ESEA. Charter schools and choice vouchers will end representative government as we know it. These videos explain the history, who has funded this takeover, the dumbing down of America, and why it is being implemented by both the Democrats and Republicans with Barack Obama pushing to get the job done. People are clamoring across the country to understand why their local neighborhood schools are closing and being replaced by charter schools, privatizing education. Traditional teachers cannot explain why they are being replaced or evaluated on how their students score on tests forcing them to 'teach to the test.' Common Core is a de-facto national curriculum with a national test being developed, nationalizing education in this country. Federal choice  vouchers, where the money ""follows the child"" will kill our system of taxing in local government, and charter schools are being expanded to fill the void. Charlotte Iserbyt has dedicated the last 50 years exposing the socialist plan for a global transition by experimenting on our children. Psycho-behavioral techniques are being used to change your child's attitudes, values, and beliefs.  If you want to know the facts, get these videos and share them with everyone you know. These national leaders highlighted in the videos will give you the background that you need to fight the system. Our country depends on you and what we can do to slow the system down.",1388793600,18,2270,5.24793388429752
174632,5,0985553847,"in order to understand what is going on in American education today you MUST understand the history.  This series of DVDs will take you some time to get through but it is better use of your time than watching television.  These patriots have lived the history and they do us a great favor by documenting and making available information we would never know if they hadn't shared their true experience and years of research.  Some things might be hard to handle but believe me none of these people have anything to gain (unlike Pearson, Gates and so many other greedy, power hungry people) except to educate and help save our country and our children.

7795281,5,0985553847,"I've only looked at the first DVD of a set of 8, so I do not expect a high rating for my review here.

My current review is incomplete because the contents could be better reviewed by those who have better understanding of education systems, both North American and European (incl. Britain)

Ideally it would be great if someone who has an understanding of the European education system could compare the European with the N.American systems.

All I can say at the moment, with my limited insight of the subject matter, is that the DVD compilation is of high quality, and that it avoids the neoliberal economic viewpoint (privatisation of the Commons, incl. education for humans.)

This subject matter is a huge issue, probably fundamental to the free thinking needed to arrive at the truths of our existence and the custodial role we could play on this unique planet and its life.

I spent an enormous amount of time searching for equivalent DVD material on European education systems, but could find none. It amazes me that there is only this set of material for seekers of truth about an education system.

The fundamental problem with democracy today is the fact that most of the Western world's population is too uneducated to seek the right understanding required to select the wise leaders needed for governing people on this planet. We need the right education for this, which is unbiased, and therefore not favouring the narrow, selfish interests of those few (1%) who covet the wealth of this world.",1422576000,,1509,4.852140077821011

Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying, ""the philosophy of the classroom in one generation becomes the philosophy of the government in the next.""  We are reaping what's been sown for the last 40 plus years in the field of education.  All of us, whether we have children or grandchildren in school today, need to be ""educated"" ourselves about the agenda behind the educational bureaucracy; after all, we will (and do) live with the results in our society/culture/government daily.",1405296000,3,559,5.054347826086956
7795285,5,0985553847,"Charlotte Iserbyt and all the presenters have labored tirelessly to reveal the long history of the plan to rob our children, and for that matter, all of us having traveled the road of the public education system, of the love of learning. When I reflect on the dull, sanitized, and yes boring years of school, only in my adult years have I learned to love learning and that comes when you see just how fascinating the world is to learn from, not simply the need to study to the test. To think that young people don't want to sit class and be bored and frustrated by what passes for education (aka training) is no small wonder. As the saying goes, 'the mind is a terrible thing to waste'.",1405123200,3,686,4.3671875

It not only connects the dots, but also gives all of us solutions that we can implement now.  Yes, the process of changing our country back to a Republic will be slow, but it can be done with this tool of enlightenment and empowerment.

I recommend this DVD set to anyone that has that feeling that something is wrong with our once wonderful REPUBLIC, but just can't put their finger on what exactly ""THAT"" is.
