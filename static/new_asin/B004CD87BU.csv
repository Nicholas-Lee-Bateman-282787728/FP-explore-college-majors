8422940,5,B004CD87BU,"One reviewer on here wasn't exactly pleased with UFC 124. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, because I personally thought it was awesome! This was in Montreal, Canada, and what better way to treat the Canadians than have their favorite Welterweight defend his UFC Title on home soil! Georges ""Rush"" St-Pierre is indeed the UFC Welterweight Champion of the World, and Josh Koscheck doesn't like that too much. They were coaches on The Ultimate Fighter, and as you might expect, Koscheck did little to gain any fans. He ran his mouth, got under GSP's skin, and ran his mouth some more, not impressing a whole lot of people. The first time these two fought at UFC 74, GSP dominated Koscheck in a 3 round battle, and Koscheck didn't like that all too well. Will Koscheck get his revenge and get the knock out he thinks he deserves? Not if GSP has ANYTHING to say about it! This is the Main Event for UFC 124!

And if you ask me, Sean McCorkle is pretty stupid. He calls himself ""Big Sexy,"" and he won his UFC debut in his hometown against Mark Hunt, so all of a sudden, he's not only ""Big Sexy,"" but he thinks he's a big deal, and he's got a really big mouth. Maybe, just maybe, he should mouth off about other people, because Stefan Struve is PISSED! And a 6'11"" ""Skyscraper"" who's pissed off is a dangerous opponent. He's had submissions too, and a KNOCK OUT OF THE NIGHT against Christian Morecraft at UFC 117. So these two Heavyweights are going to throw down.

Plus, TUF 2 winner, Joe ""Daddy"" Stevenson and TUF 6 winner, Mac Danzig will meet in the middle, probably to see who stays in the UFC. Coming into this fight, they haven't exactly been impressive.

I personally think that this is loaded and bloated with good stuff, including 11 fights. I'll list those fights below!

Pat Audinwood vs. John Makdessi: At UFC 119, Audinwood didn't have a lot of luck against Thiago Tavares. He takes on the cross-eyed Canadian who loves his taekwondo in an MMA world. This is awesome display of technique, a lot of fun to watch, and one man earns a unanimous decision!

T.J. Grant vs. Ricardo Almeida: You have to admire the heart of Grant, while the submissions of Almeida, you'd better fear them and be wary of them at all times! This goes almost exactly the way you expect it to go, and goes to a unanimous decision.

Matt Riddle vs. Sean Pierson: Did people know that Matt Riddle's entire MMA record is in the UFC up to this point? He's done well, but Pierson wants a piece of the action as well, and it shows! Incredible fight that goes back and forth, and a well earned unanimous decision is awarded!

Jesse Bongfeldt vs. Rafael Natal: Canadian Bongfeldt is the newcomer, and Natal wants his first W on his opponent's home soil. Well, it was a great back and forth battle. And in the end, this fight is a DRAW! Still a good battle.

Mark Bocek vs. Dustin Hazelett: You would've thought this would be a stand-up war, or a neutralizing ground battle. The man who won this is one of my favorite UFC fighters ever, and took home a beautiful submission in just over 2 minutes! YES!!

Joe Doerksen vs. Dan Miller: Needless to say, regardless of Doerksen's losing record with the organization, he's a respected fighter. Dan Miller is nobody to mess with either. This is a back and forth battle that stays on the ground mostly, and a split decision is awarded!

Thiago Alves vs. John Howard: Both of these guys love a good battle, and Howard won me over from day one. This is a tough fight that goes to a unanimous decision!

Joe Stevenson vs. Mac Danzig: Ok, with these 2 going at it, you figure it would eventually end with one submitting the other, right? Let me tell you something, one man is right on the money in his pre-fight interview, and scores a beautiful 1st round KO after some great back and forth action! BTW, both of these guys stuck around after this fight, even though Stevenson was eventually let go after a few more fights.

Jim Miller vs. Charles Oliveira: After seeing Darren Elkins and Efrain Escudero being submitted by this guy, who wants to mess around with the likes of Oliveira? Why, Jim Miller does, of course! The 1st round submission in this fight is impressive!

Stefan Struve vs. Sean McCorkle: SHUT UP, Sean McCorkle! Struve made you look stupid, you didn't like it, and was even man enough to squash it afterwards. 1st round TKO settles this rather quickly, and in his next fight, Christian Morecraft made him pass out with a guillotine choke, releasing him from the UFC...HA!

Georges St-Pierre vs. Josh Koscheck: SHUT UP, Josh Koscheck! This is the best you can do when you fight for the title? You got owned, and Canadian fans loved it!

And I loved this DVD. You don't like it? I guess that's your loss, not mine.",1325030400,,4738,4.512252042007002
8422941,2,B004CD87BU,"UFC 124: St Pierre vs Koscheck 2 was a really weak card, bearing in mind that it came only a few weeks after UFC 123: Rampage vs Machida, which itself happened only a week after UFC 122! which took place in Germany. So was it a case of MMA overload? It certainly seems so. Not that it mattered to the 23 thousand plus who watched the event at the Bell Center in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After all Canada has always been a hot bed for UFC events and of course local hero and UFC welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre was defending his title in the main event against Josh Koscheck.

This event was really all about that one fight, the two opposing coaches from season 12 of The Ultimate Fighter, would once again fight after St-Pierre had previously beaten Koscheck back at UFC 74. So could Koscheck get his revenge in St-Pierre's own back yard. Koscheck would go in to the fight as Canada's number one enemy a role he relished, St-Pierre as always said he would do his fighting in the Octagon. In reality the fight isn't that great and won't have you rushing back to watch anytime soon.

The biggest shocker is the Co main event, if that's what you can call it. Sean McCorkle who only had one previous fight in the UFC and that was on the under card of Mir Vs Cro Cop and is hardly a well known name to the casual MMA fan would face of against Stefan Struve, it is a fast paced fight but have these two really done enough to deserve a co main event spot? A lightweight battle between Jim Miller and the unbeaten Charles Oliveira is an intersting match up of experience against youth. A Welterweight bout between Thiago Alves and John Howard is nothing spectacular. There is also a battle of Ultimate Fighter winners in Season 2 winner Joe Stevenson facing season 6 winner Mac Danzig, what's interesting is that Matt Hughes was their coach when they won the competition, not that get's a mention on the card, it would have been interesting to hear Hughes thoughts on this fight and who he thought would win.

With these 2 disc UFC DVD's you get all the Preliminary card fights such as Jim Miller's brother Dan fighting Canadian Joe Doerksen. There is naturally quite a few fights featuring Canadians on the DVD, the highlight being Sean Pierson taking on American Matt Riddle in a thrilling battle. You also get the countdown show which is excellent as per usual and if you haven't seen the event it's what you should watch first. This is one UFC event that's really lacking star quality(bar the main event) and is UFC DVD to skip.",1303689600,,2533,4.490238611713666
8422942,4,B004CD87BU,Great dvd! The TUF season 12 really built up the fight between Koscheck and GSP. The big question was could Koscheck KO GSP like Serra did? GSP had other ideas and put on one of his best performances to date. This is definitely worth watching for GSP's perfomance in the stand up. Not the best card on paper but had some good finishes. wwwdotufclatestdotcom,1296604800,2,357,4.59375
