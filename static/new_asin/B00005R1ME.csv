1652496,5,B00005R1ME,"""THE LONE RANGER"" was the first of two Technicolor theatrical features based on the popular TV series of the same name. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, stars of the TV series, essay the roles of the Lone Ranger and his faithful Indian companion Tonto. This time around, our heroes take on evil rancher Reece Kilgore (Lyle Bettger), who hopes to become an all powerful land baron by fomenting an Indian war. It is up to the Lone Ranger to keep the peace and to find out why Kilgore is up to what he's up to. To expedite this, the Ranger adopts a couple of clever disguises (though we never see his full face au naturel). Among the more novel aspects of the film is little Beverly Washburn as Lila Kilgore, the sweet, innocent daughter of the double-dyed villain. The nominal leading lady is played by Bonita Granville, who co-produced the film with her husband Jack Wrather. ""THE LONE RANGER"" proved successful enough to warrant a sequel, ""THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD"" (1958).",1152144000,4,992,4.642045454545454

1652498,4,B00005R1ME,"I wish to reply to your criticizim of Rhino for the running of a show in what you call Video Compression. The Lone Ranger was origionally filmed at 24 Frames-per-Second. Most shows today are filmed (and run) at 30 Frames-per-Second. I agree with you that the sped-up look (24 fps run at 30 fps) looks fake. However, may I point out that if you were to run that show at the origional 24 frames-per-second it will look somewhat choppy. Running it at 30 looks ""Artificially Fast"" and thus FAKE. For all of us that like The lone Ranger, this may be a ""No-Win"" situation. May I suggest that we try to appreciate The Lone Ranger for the classic show that it is (despite the technical glitch). Thanks ! P.S. Actually, my Favorite show is Lost in Space. Season 1 is in Black and White. Oh well, I love it anyway.",1139097600,6,804,4.366666666666666
1652499,5,B00005R1ME,"This videodisc will not disappoint. The image clarity is quite good, but not as crystal clear as, for example, the 1950s classic black'n'white movie, ""It Came from Beneath the Sea."" The sound quality is excellent. In case you were wondering, the classic introduction featuring the William Tell Overture is there for you, along with the usually corny introductory monologue.

There are four stories, Rustler's Hideout, War Horse, Pete and Pedro, and The Renegades. Rustler's Hideout is a classic story, about a pioneer settler who was wrongly accused, and had to spend some time in jail. At a later point, the mayor's son gets kidnapped by a gang. The pioneer settler, with some prodding from Mr. Lone Ranger, decides that it would be in his best interest to help rescue the mayor's son. This tactic succeeds, and the pioneer settler becomes a hero in the eyes of the community.

Tonto has a major role, but not the starring role, in each of the four episodes. What is funny is that at one point, where a cowboy is slinking across the desert, the music comes from a slow movement from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. The story is not just mindless action, as is found in the latest crop of Star Wars movies. In contrast, the Lone Ranger stories include episodes with misunderstandings, deception, trickery, etc.

At one point, the voice-over narration states that the goal of the U.S.government, at the time, was to protect the Indians from unscrupulous vandals.  Of course, we all know that in its affairs with the Indians, the U.S. government was itself the unscrupulous vandal.  The goal of the script-writer for the Lone Ranger narration was to re-write history.  Bad script-writer.  Bad, bad, bad.

You might have to order Volume One in order to obtain Volume Two. (I did not order Volume Two, and so I do not know if Volume Two contains inside the Volume One disk, or the Volume Two disk.)",1134000000,3,1892,4.817901234567901

1652501,2,B00005R1ME,Why in the world would you want to buy this collection of edited/time compressed episodes. They totally violate my memories of the character. Rhino has normally had a reputation for issuing some of the finest TV programs. This is really below their standards. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I hope that ultimately someone wil issue all the Lone Ranger episodes in their original condition.,1122076800,43,402,4.926470588235294
1652502,1,B00005R1ME,"We'll Rhino In their lack of research or un-caring have released edited and/or time compressed versions of this classic series! Traditionally t.v. shows produced prior to the early 80's were made with more show and less commercials in mind. The Lone Ranger went to color It's last two seasons. These shows run 25 unhurried minutes when seen without commericials. Rhino was given edited and worse yet time compressed episodes as their dvd masters. Notice how everything seems rushed and un-natural. Movements are compromised by the digital manipulation of the originl 24 frames per second to the now 30 to 40 frames a second. Nick at Nite and T.V. Land both show edited/time compressed prints. When we buy ANY films or t.v. shows on dvd, we expect them to look fantastic and be UN-CUT and UN-TAMPERED with. These shows are neither. Worse yet, the great black and white origin of the Lone Ranger was originally a THREE PART adventure. Here Rhino provides us with two edited parts leaving the climactic episode off! I understand that Rhino has announced they are releasing 19 Lone Ranger episodes in a box set. Will these be un-cut? Will these be un-fair examples of our t.v. heritage that generations to come will be cheated by? Write your letters kiddies. Let Rhino and the rest know that you want to see these shows as your parents and grandparents saw them.",1046736000,134,1358,4.832618025751073

Actually I never realized there were any color episodes of the TV series, since I was a sophomore in college when these four episodes were aired.  The color and sound are excellent, adding to the enjoyment of these melodramas that represent the finest American values.",1012435200,15,560,4.894736842105263

That same year Warner Bros produced a movie called ""The Lone Ranger"" in great color.  The TV costume that Clayton Moore wore in the TV series was the same as he used in the 1956 movie.  Actually the production values were the best in the whole series.  I recommend this one because it is in color and much better production values",1385596800,,472,4.367816091954023

Nothing like the Lone Ranger in color!

Based upon what I read here, I won't be buying these. Thanks guys. Time compression-can't believe it. Oh, well.
