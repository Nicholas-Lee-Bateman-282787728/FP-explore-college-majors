8052667,5,B0007WFUL0,This is an outstanding video that I use during my Vietnam/Counterculture of the 60s unit in class. The kids are riveted by it and it gives a lot of unknown information about the origins of some of my most famous memorials. The part on the Vietnam Wall Memorial in D.C. is extremely touching.,1430265600,,291,4.509433962264151

8052671,5,B0007WFUL0,"I was in Washington, D.C. several years ago for a convention and had the opportunity to visit most of the war memorials.  The only one I missed was the Marine Corps one.  When you are at Arlington national Cemetary, you are walking on hallowed ground.  The ceremony of the changing of the guard by the Tomb of the Unknowns is very somber, awe-inspiring and moving.  As a nation, we owe a huge debt of gratitude that can never be repaid to these men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the cause for freedom.",1371686400,2,516,4.4
