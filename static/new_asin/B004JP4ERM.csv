8431967,1,B004JP4ERM,"This is a joke! Worse than a 12year old's home video of a family trip!
I expected to experience the wonderful drives around the Island of Maui and all you see are a couple of spots of the cliffs and people going on a walking tour of the sugar cane fields or a lame 3 man Luau.

We Never drive - or see the scenery!

The audio was weird and hollow sounding and the video could have been of any island in the world!

Wow - how did they get to sell this on Amazon?",1325980800,4,461,3.831578947368421
8431968,2,B004JP4ERM,"The film showed very little of this Great Drive, The Road To Hana, with the camera shoots being taken from the back seat over the driver's shoulder and with the rear vision mirror blocking any views. There was more shoots taken of the cameraman's traveling compainion walking to the attraction than of the attractions and too much time was spent showing what you can eat. This was a disappointing Great Drive.",1322092800,4,409,4.774647887323944
