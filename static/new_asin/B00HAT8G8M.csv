6152851,3,B00HAT8G8M,"I had purchased the Wilderness Family Trilogy a few days before I purchased this movie.  The Trilogy titles are ""The Adventures of the Wilderness Family"",  ""The Further Adventures of the Wilderness Family""  and ""Mountain Family Robinson"". The covers are different (not so modern looking).  When I saw this Title and cover ""The Wilderness Family 3""  I was under the impression that it was another movie about the same family. filmed at a later date.  NOT SO.  ACTUALLY IT IS NOT THE TITLE AT ALL!  IT IS THE MOVIE ""MOUNTAIN FAMILY ROBINSON"" which I had just purchased.  I'm not happy at all, now I have paid for a duplicate of the same movie with a different title and cover.  Very misleading!  Wish I could send it back for a refund, but apparently the time had run out before I opened the DVD and discovered what I had been sold!",1402099200,9,830,4.54054054054054
6152852,5,B00HAT8G8M,YES WHAT A GREAT MOVIE THEY DONT MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANY MORE AND THEY SHOULD THEY WOULD BE A GOOD SELLER,1399507200,,105,3.8181818181818183
6152853,3,B00HAT8G8M,the third part of the families life in the wilderness.  everyone from little kids to grandparents can sit and enjoy this film.,1398470400,,126,4.7272727272727275
6152854,2,B00HAT8G8M,"It is exactly the same as Mountain Family Robinson. The title is misleading. If you own mountain Family Robinson, Do not  buy.",1398384000,7,126,4.7272727272727275
6152855,4,B00HAT8G8M,"Beautiful scenery, good story, although some of it seemed far fetched. The majority of the time, whether the children or the entire family would wonder into the wilderness unprotected from ferocious animals, their dog would always save the day.  I also purchased part 3. Extremely disappointed in the quality of both DVDs.  LIONSGATE states ""REMASTERED"" on the cover. I think not!  Some parts were shaky and blurry. Sound quality was fine. I may have to return both of them and purchase them by other studios, but their prices are too high.",1397260800,,540,4.912087912087912
6152856,5,B00HAT8G8M,"Bought this for my daughter's 35th birthday. She loved it as a child. Great childhood memory.
She still loves it.",1397001600,,113,4.7
8631415,2,B00HAT8G8M,"I think they ran out of ideas for really bad things to happen, which hurt the movie a lot.  For example, Pat getting pneumonia, and Jenny getting sick with her asthma attacks.  Two movies were enough.",1512000000,,200,4.527777777777778

8631419,5,B00HAT8G8M,"A great follow up movie from part 2. You have to own it if you brought parts 1 and 2.  These dvd,s have better picture quality than the 3 same movies on 1 disc.",1431302400,,160,3.7058823529411766

8631423,5,B00HAT8G8M,This movie journey continues off from part two up to the last end of the Wilderness Family. Its always nice to see the beginning to end of this beautiful family. If you love the Wilderness Family from the original when it came out and didn't know it continues into two more parts then I recommend you to get 2&3 to complete the collection.,1411689600,,339,4.396825396825397
8631424,5,B00HAT8G8M,"So happy to have found this on dvd, I've wanted to replace our vhs of this for years.  It was a favorite of mine growing up and its still a great classic in our household.  There's something for everyone, action, family values, and if you love animals and nature you will love this movie.  Last in a trilogy which all are worth watching.",1408579200,,337,4.317460317460317
