8097232,4,B000CCFLM8,"The Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa Part 3, Advanced.
 It is not dirty (sic) at all compared to a Batcha or Merengue. The three DVD set may have 100 turns and patterns. They do move right along, so it does have a quick pace. This is east coast Salsa, NOT the Salsa done in California, or Arizona. The basic is reversed from how it is done in Arizona.
There are three camera angles, direct front, high left front and high rear. This is very helpful. The instructor, ""Gigi"" can be annoying, she says ""automatically"" way to many times. I cannot think of anything in dance that is automatic.
The DVD that I watch the most is the third, advanced Salsa DVD. The other two will show you how to do east coast Salsa.
Moves covered on the third DVD: Girl's hammerlock, man's hammerlock with walk-outs, bowtie, wraps, two hand rope turns, right side straight jacket, shoulder rolls, mans pivots and turns. Plus many other patterns and moves. Gigi has her own Spanish names for the dances I listed. I list the patterns, based upon West Coast Swing, and Country-Two Step names.

8097233,5,B000CCFLM8,"This is a fabulous DVD for those who are already good salsa dancers, but want to expand their repertoire, brush up on their footwork, and learn the latest Cuban Salsa moves. We get a myriad of great combinations demonstrated by the very attractive pair of Gigi and Pedro, and the routines are viewable from 3 angles (front, high, and rear); you also have the option of choosing which of the many lessons you want to watch, in this programmable DVD. Digifilm has revolutionized the instruction DVD genre with the options it gives its audience, and the options also give the DVD added interest, and keep the lessons fresh and interesting.

Gigi is the primary instructor, and her explanations are clear and understandable, but the real treat is at the end, when Gigi and Pedro dance full out to music and dazzle us with their fancy footwork and sleek, graceful movements. The ambiance of the setting is also marvelous: A huge room, with gleaming parquet floors, a sparkling chandelier, and a few elegant furnishings, including a luxurious tapestry adorning one wall, with 2 doors leading out to a lush exterior. It all has an ""old world"" atmosphere that adds to the enjoyment of learning from Gigi and Pedro, who contrast this serene setting with their youth and exuberance. The music is also good, featuring Aris Martinez with ""Ni Tiguere Gallo Ni Paraguayo."" Excellent production values, expert instruction, as well as the many ways you can program this DVD to suit your needs and tastes, make these lessons for advanced Salsa dancers one not to miss!",1144195200,3,1551,4.875
8097234,4,B000CCFLM8,"This DVD follows the same format as the previous dvds in the

series. I like the multi angle feature, and the moves are explained

in a clear concise manner. If you already have the previous two

dvds, you will already be familiar with the format. This one

contains another 28 moves.",1142726400,2,284,4.509803921568627
8097235,5,B000CCFLM8,"The amazing and attractive instructor Gigi and her partner/ coinstructor Pedro step up the energy and technical abilities required of the student. They teach an elegant execution of complicated and exceptional dance movements for those ready to be the envy of everyone out on the dance floor. Once mastered be prepared to attract an audience!

Both Gigi and Pedro provide descriptions, explanations and actual demonstrations of dance techniques and maneuvers. They use an easy to follow count and demonstrate with several repetitions before moving on to another set of lessons. The multiangle programmable feature makes this the best and most outstanding method of learning salsa dancing. The different angles are *especially* effective in viewing the proper arm holds and allow clear views of executing the steps shown by the instructors. The fact is ... these lessons would cost a fortune if given by live instructors.

There are over 25 different sets of movements taught. Some of which are: 3 way stop, Sombrero, Dedo Sobrea Do, El Sueter, La Cuadra, Es Conde/ Posata, La Victoria, El Zorro, La Jenny, Enrosa, Abanico Complicado, Romolino, Sententa Complicado, Dedo Por Do, La Tuja, Bebe, and the *famous* Beso [*kiss*] Por De Bajo, Dedo Por Debajo, Adios Largo, Cando Complicado, Melon, Mona Lisa, La Rumbera, Kentucky Complicado, Pon Le Sabor Complicado, Jackie Chan, and El Medico. The dance movements are as beautiful to watch as their names sound. Watching Gigi and Pedro dance together at the end is a treat, they are so joyous and exuberant, quite oblivious to the cameras ... Sometimes I just keep playing the DVD in order to view Gigi and Pedro dance the salsa. Hint to the guys: you will *want* to take dance lessons from Gigi who wears a black dress that fits her trim and athletic body like a glove ... Most certainly some of you will use the zoom feature not just for the reason to review a step or two!

The prerequisites to learning advanced salsa are these: the couple needs to have mastered the basics (DVD 1) and the intermediate dance lessons (DVD 2). Besides building on past experience and lessons, advanced salsa requires a committment of practice time,  minimum several times a week done for many  months, possibly a year or more ... however the lessons will *definitely* pay off. The body needs time to develop ""muscle memory"" which is the ability to automatically  reproduce newly acquired body alignments in a timely manner to the music. This DVD proves that anyone who strongly desires to be an advanced dancer *can* achieve this goal. Salsa dancing requires having a partner with whom one is comfortable. The love of the Latin music and dance will transport the couple io a higher plane  when executing the lessons learned on this advanced salsa DVD.

8097236,5,B000CCFLM8,"This dvd carrys on the high standard that we have come to expect from Debdoot Das.

This is an excellent dvd of advanced Miami Salsa dance moves.

I must add that Gigi & Pedro are flowing together beautifully now.

This is a must have for Salsa dancers.

Highly recommened.",1141430400,3,273,4.510204081632653
8097237,4,B000CCFLM8,"* Teaches miami style turnpatterns, se below

* The patterns are shown in a straight forward way and are easy to watch and understand

* There are not a lot of details about leading and following or other technique

* The counting of steps is 123 456 with no mentioning of the structure of the music. This could be confusing if you are used to counting 1234 5678 with steps on 123 567. No great disadvantage though - you soon get a hang of this way of counting

* You can't read which turns are on the DVD on the box. This is a disadvantage. Of course you can write out the list from the homepage

* The menu system when using a DVDplayer-remote is a bit complicated. You have to press a lot on the arrows on your remote if you want to select among the different turns. On your computer it is a lot easier

If you want to work on your advanced salsa, specifically Rueda moves, this will complete your collection.  I just hope they put out more DVD's, like an Advanced, Volume 2 or something.
