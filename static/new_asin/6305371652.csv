7892051,1,6305371652,I finally gave it to someone that had a VHS. I did not see that it was a VHS prior to purchase.  Will look closer in the future. Did not meet expectations.,1404000000,,155,3.84375
7892052,5,6305371652,"Though this is the same movie, I do not have the VHS tape, therefore I cannot tell you anything about its specifications or quality.  I saw and enjoyed this film so much, that I had to review it any way that I could.  This is essentially the same story as Jet Li's ""Fearless"", about Huo Yuanjia.  The differences are many, but I liked this one quite a bit more.

Philip Ko Fei (""Tiger Over Wall"", ""8 Diagram Pole Fighter"") plays a kung fu master, who won't allow his youngest son to learn the family's style.  Yasuaki Kurata (""Fist of Legend"", ""Heroes of the East"") plays the boy's tutor, who secretly teaches him how to fight.  After spying on the father's kung fu for awhile, Kurata returns to Japan, leaving the boy with a fighting manual.  The boy continues to study, and soon the actor playing him turns into Leung Kar Yan (""The Victim"", ""Warriors Two"").

That's probably all you should know about the story before seeing it.  Those of you who read my reviews are aware of my hesitance in issuing 5-stars to a film.  The only flick I've previously given that honor to was ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"".  While the story of ""Legend of a Fighter"" didn't pull me in as much as ""36th Chamber"", I can't think of ANYTHING that would've made it better.  The fights are excellent, the story is good, the humor is minimal (and quite funny), and the characterizations are rich and well performed (especially Kurata's).  Why this has not received a mainstream release on DVD is beyond me.  Quite simply, it is one of the best kung fu movies ever made.

The DVD that I have is a bootleg from Bonsai Media, with a running time of 89 minutes.  The picture is remastered (unfortunately more like Xenon than Celestial) but it is full-screened, though it's not a big deal.  SEE COMMENT for details.  The version to get is from Hong Kong Legends, though I don't think it has seen an official Region 1 release.  If Dragon Dynasty is still interested in listening to their customers, perhaps they'll eventually consider it.  There's money to be made here, people!  Let us bow our heads in prayer.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

7892053,5,6305371652,"This is definately a great film. The  acting,although dubbed,is pretty good and the movie manages to stay on track. It is mostly serious except a couple silly scenes. The movie highlights chinese legend Huo Yuen Chia. This  was the master of Bruce Lee in Chinese Connection,and Jet Li in Fist Of  Legend. Although in this movie he's called Fok Yuen Gap(translation  error?).Huo's father(Phillip Kao) views him(young Yuen Chia is played by  Yuen Yat Chor)as a weakling and will not train him in martial arts,much to  his changrin. Instead his father hires an academic teacher(Shoji Kurata) for  him. Feeling sorry for the young boy,the teacher decides to teach the boy  how to fight. He learns a lot from the teacher and also spies on his father  teaching his brothers the family style. The teacher leaves(he was actually a  japanese spy,there to learn the Huo family style) and young Huo continues  to train. Years later Huo(now played by Leung Kar Yan) is still spying on  his father,and actually saves the family name by beating an eagle claw  stylist. After that the father names Yuen Chia head of the family. After  defeating a karate fighter,the Japanese warrior kills himself. The warrior's  father wants revenge and sends Japan's best fighter to china for a duel. The  fighter happens to be Yuen Chia's old teacher. During the end fight we see  that the Japanese teacher still cares for his student though he pretends  not to. There is a very serious tone to the end fight which makes it even  better. The fights are great. It is the usual great early 80's choreography  and hard hitting fun from the Yuen clan. On a kind of funny side,sometimes  when people are yelling Fok Yuen Gap,it doesnt always sound like that.",951004800,9,1724,4.815699658703072
