8260704,4,B00161ZE1C,"This is the hardest video I own. I work out everyday, and I own the TLT, one of the TLPs, most of the firms, and a bunch of the fitprime. This video takes the cake for kicking my butt. I'm ready to tap out half an hour in to it (but I push through it). It's almost all lower body work, and it works you to the max. I love it. I do wish the Ab work in the end was a little tougher (fast cheetah has a really great section). The quality is... well... fitprime, which aka is terrible. It doesn't do Tracie justice. She deserves so much better than the bad editing, horrible color, messy set, and odd camera angles. BUT, because it's Tracie, she makes it shine and work anyways. I would encourage anyone who wants to kick it up another level get this.",1228176000,7,747,4.08843537414966
8260705,4,B00161ZE1C,"The FitPrime workouts were created by Anna Benson, co-founded of The Firm workouts. When these videos were first released about 5 years ago, there were many debates about whether the workouts were innovative or just plain weird. I've always been in the former camp, as for me, the FitPrime workouts contain mainly uniquely effective moves, and I've always found them to be a lot of fun.  Weights First was the very first video in the FitPrime series, and it's only recently been released on DVD. It's led by Tracie Long, who started with The Firm and who has since moved on to her own DVD series. In this equipment-heavy workout, Tracie uses a barbell, dumbbells, a tall step (The Firm Fanny Lifter works well), a medicine ball (one that bounces), and a stick or dowel (primarily used for balance, so you could make do without).

Tracie begins using the ball for the 6.5 minute warm-up sequence. In the first half of the warm-up, she uses the ball and dowel for a toss/catch series, and in the second half, she moves the ball out to the side while doing a 1-legged squat/back extension; I found the warming up with the ball to be fun. Tracie then begins the weights work using the barbell, performing a series that includes good mornings, squats, and clean and press.

At this point, Tracie begins a sequence of lower body work, staying with the left leg only. Exercises include a front lunge/dip combo, 1-arm tricep french press (also on the left), another front lunge/rear dip sequence that includes ball bounces, and a leg press/single leg squat sequence (2 full sets--very tough!). Next, Tracie leads you through a brief cardio burst which combines marches with little hops while holding light weights. Following this, you'll continue to work the left side with yet another front/rear lunge series and then finally move on to biceps work with the barbell. More upper body work follows, including a 1-arm lat row, push-ups with one hand on the box and one on the ball, and triceps push-ups on the box. At this point, Tracie performs some very brief yoga stretches (<1 minute).

Going back to the lower body work, Tracie has you do side squats with abduction (both sides) and then plie squats with a biceps curl. Finally, it is time to switch to the right side of the body, going through the first lunge/dip combo, the tricep french press, the second lunge/dip combo with the ball, and then the tough leg press sequence.  Next there is another brief cardio interval which Tracie calls ""light cardio"": using no weights this time, she performs marches with jumps in and out.  She then continues with the last lunge/dip series plus upright rows with the barbell.

With about 15 minutes left to go in the workout, Tracie begins a nice abs segment. Using the stick under the knees, she does roll ups/roll downs, and then with the ball between the knees, she does upper and lower crunches.  Finally, there is a crunch with ball toss--this was tough but fun!  Tracie does about 3 minutes of abs work on one side, spends 4 minutes stretching, and then does another 3 minutes of abs work on the other side; the little break in the middle felt nice. One thing I did NOT like about this workout was the final 6 minutes of yoga stretching. Tracie seemed a little stiff here and moved a little too quickly, so I will probably do my own cool-down in the future.

Overall, this is a nice addition to my growing FitPrime collection (I now have 8 of 12), despite the fact that the production values aren't quite as good as the later FitPrimes (eg, the set is too busy, the camera angles aren't always the best, etc.). There is a definite lower body emphasis here--the first time I tried it, my butt was sore for days afterward!  This is definitely a workout for intermediate to advanced exercisers who enjoy the quirkiness of the FitPrime workouts and want to blast their lower body.",1219104000,10,3868,4.665198237885463
8260706,5,B00161ZE1C,"I just did this video for the first time this morning and it was awesome.  I'm an advanced excersier and am always looking for tougher workouts and I found it!  I love all Tracie Long videos--The Firm, TLT, FitPrime--and I highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about their workouts.  Lots of tough leg and butt work with a great abs section and fun little cardio bursts.  If I could give it more stars, I would.",1212883200,8,420,4.415584415584416
8260707,5,B00161ZE1C,"I just received this workout a few days ago and did it for the first time this morning.  I sweated buckets and felt the burn.  If you want a great workout and have butt or hip issues this is your workout!  I am an advanced exerciser of about 5 to 6 days a week and I am already feeling the after effects in the same day as doing this workout.  If you are new to exercise you can still enjoy this workout just don't add the weights or use very light weights; however, if you are an advanced exerciser add on the weights and get ready to sweat!  I like the use of the medicine ball for variety and fun.  You will not get bored doing this one because the routine is changed-up so often.  LOVE THIS ONE!",1206403200,9,699,4.021739130434782
