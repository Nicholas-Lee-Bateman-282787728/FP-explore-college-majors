6578654,5,B00MHVLA5O,So funny.,1431043200,,9,4.0
6578655,5,B00MHVLA5O,"Crude? You bet - that's what we love about it.  The pacing and the ""bants"" (thanks, Jay) were completely on a par with the earlier shows and movie and it was great to hang out in Australia with these four again. Honestly they don't seem a minute older; certainly no wiser! Hope they do another film (soon).",1426636800,,306,4.368421052631579
6578656,4,B00MHVLA5O,"As other reviewers have stated, it's not as good as the series, but the guys still deliver the usual foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed, ridiculous farce that they do so well. Set down under this time, there is just about enough credibility for the four clumsy, naive idiots  to pull it off successfully (as Jay would say).",1421452800,,315,4.833333333333333
6578657,3,B00MHVLA5O,"As most Inbetweeners fans will tell you, neither the first movie nor the second movie are a fair representation of just how brilliant the TV show was. I pity the person who sees the movies before experiencing the TV show. How unfair. The TV show is superlative on all levels.

That said, I have to say that I enjoyed the Inbetweeners Movie 2 more than I did the first Inbetweeners movie. When I watched the first one, I just sort of silently enjoyed it. I never really laughed or anything. I just enjoyed it without really finding it all that funny. Especially compared to the TV show. The Inbetweeners Movie 2, however, had several laugh out loud moments and the overall level of comedy was much higher and more sustained than its predecessor. Don't expect to bust a gut throughout this movie, but expect a better pound-for-pound comedy experience as compared to the first one.

Again, nothing will ever compare to the show. The characters are now in college (Uni) and these two movies are really the only way to bring the Inbetweeners back to the fans. Definitely worth an Inbetweeners fan's time, but hardly a substitute or continuation of the show.",1421193600,,1152,4.698019801980198
6578658,2,B00MHVLA5O,"Okay, first of all let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE the original series, British humour while mostly misunderstood and regarded as unfunny to some is one I can *relate* to, and generally love. After the series ended I watched the first movie and it was great! This one however just seems like an interjection rather than an actual movie, in other words it looks like the writers, producers and the director were just looking to make a quick buck out of it, rather than producing something entertaining for the fans out there.

The characters are still superb, and the dialogues are fine, it's just the storyline that was atrocious. In this version the 4 boys have already all graduated from High School and are attending University well 3 of them at least, and because it's them they are still considered as outcasts by their college peers, nothing has changed. They fly to Australia to meet up with Jay who is staying at his uncle's place upon hearing How WONDERFUL Australia is, and how easy it is to get girls, booze and exciting jobs like being a DJ in a famous club. Anyways, they go there expecting all of this to come true and little do they know what surprises were waiting for them.

The start was fine, it's only after they land in that the whole movie goes down hell. I just didn't like it and the ending was so abrupt and sudden that it just made me think the writers never had a solid plot to begin with. Also, each character's plot line from the first movie except for Simon's and partially Jay's were all ignored like they never happened. What a disappointment.

Thankfully the movie didn't drag forever, and the writers kept it quick and short but it didn't give me much satisfaction as I hoped it would. Some subplots were totally uncalled for and just boring like the meditation camp and unfortunately that was the main focus of the movie.

I don't recommend this, if you wanna laugh watch the series and the first film they were classics! Skip this one especially if you haven't watched the past two productions, It'll just make you bored and confused.",1419552000,2,2084,4.579088471849866
6578659,5,B00MHVLA5O,"Funny movie, everyone needs to see the series.

6578660,5,B00MHVLA5O,Just like the show fantastic,1468540800,,28,4.8
6578661,4,B00MHVLA5O,"If you're looking for silly, raunchy, ridiculously over the top humor, this is it.",1463184000,,82,4.928571428571429
6578662,2,B00MHVLA5O,Some funny scenes but no where near up to the quality and humor of the TV show.,1459209600,,79,3.7058823529411766
6578663,4,B00MHVLA5O,"Good. Not as good as the first movie, but if you liked the tv series you'll like this",1451088000,,85,3.7777777777777777

6578666,3,B00MHVLA5O,Ok to watch but there are better and funnier movies than this one. Nothing for kids,1436400000,,83,4.25
6578667,4,B00MHVLA5O,"Great for a laugh. Lots of sexual inuendo's and jokes, but definitely get a kick out of these guys and their shenanigans.",1436054400,,121,4.545454545454546
6578668,5,B00MHVLA5O,I love these guys! Wish they will do a third movie!,1435708800,,51,3.727272727272727
6578669,5,B00MHVLA5O,Funny - not suitable for youngsters!,1435536000,,36,5.166666666666667
6578670,4,B00MHVLA5O,"The Inbetweeners 2 is more like your traditional roadtrip movie than the original show and first movie. If you were unfamiliar with the characters it wouldn't matter for you in following what's going on.  It's your basic culture clash, dim-witted characters getting themselves into trouble abroad as they withdraw from their student loans and fly to Australia for a few weeks in a surprise catch up with their friend who has been bragging about how great his life is including his exploits with the ladies.  Of course the boys (and we viewers who are familiar with Jay) know his situation isn't going to be what he states.  Simon's girlfriend is becoming more and more possessive and demanding and his attempt to break up with her over Skype once in Sydney goes horribly wrong.  The likeable but mentally slow Neil wants to become a dolphin trainer after Jay told him if English people tell Australians their British they will be given any job they want. Will runs into a girl from his past in the nightclub where they find Jay in his actual employment who is headed to Byron Bay and since she hints he's in with a chance that's where the boys are headed too.

If you're unfamiliar with the TV show or first movie, expect Adam Sandler level crude humour and sight gags.  Although you can see some of these gags coming from their set ups, you still can't help watching as they play out.  Especially the water park scenarios.",1435449600,,1423,4.645418326693227
6578671,2,B00MHVLA5O,"Same as the first, just a different location. Just not funny.",1435276800,,61,4.636363636363637
6578672,1,B00MHVLA5O,"How the mighty have fallen. The Inbetweeners, particularly the first season, is an original and funny show. The first movie is aimed at the lowest common denominator amongst the show's fans, relying on sex jokes or gross out humor instead of wit. I had hoped they learned their lesson and returned some of the original writers for the sequel. Instead they doubled down on the idiocy. Even Simon Bird, the one and only bright spot of the first movie, is dragged down here. Perhaps the biggest gag of the movie involves feces, which we are shown quite graphically. Another gag involves killing a dolphin with fast food. If that sounds funny to you then by all means dig in. Instead I would skip it and watch the Friday Night Dinner series, a much better use of Simon Bird's talents.",1434844800,,780,4.618705035971223
6578673,4,B00MHVLA5O,"It is a great film, however, I prefer part 1  :)",1434758400,,48,3.3636363636363638
6578674,4,B00MHVLA5O,Big fan of the series - I loved those and the first film - I liked the sequel but didn't love it.,1434672000,,97,3.4545454545454546
6578675,5,B00MHVLA5O,its great. I love these guys and hope they keep it going with the inbetweener movies,1434153600,,84,4.3125
6578676,5,B00MHVLA5O,"After looking at the other reviews I guess I'm in the minority here.  I absolutely loved this movie.  Yes, it's different than the series but things have moved on ~ sort of.  But it's hilarious.  It's vulgar, disgusting,  and a riot.

Neil, Simon and Will take a trip to Australia to meet up with old friend Jay who has been searching for his former girlfriend, Jane.  The adventures and misadventures of the lads during this 90 minute romp through haliarity was well worth the time set aside to view.

Do NOT turn it off before the credits.  That last two minutes when the boys are back at the airport... well, that was almost as funny as water park segment.",1434153600,3,659,4.470588235294118
6578677,5,B00MHVLA5O,Loved it more than the first! Much funnier & more like the series!,1433894400,,66,4.153846153846154
6578678,5,B00MHVLA5O,Despite being utterly filthy the characters somehow maintain an air of innocence and likability. No mean feat... I love a bit of creative swearing  and this makes me homesick for the UK every time I watch it! Jays email at the beginning is just perfect. Fun stuff.,1433894400,,264,4.617021276595745
6578679,4,B00MHVLA5O,"4 stars because it was another well-written Inbetweeners slur fest, but the ending left me confused.  Was that the actual ending written in the screenplay?  Hard to imagine.",1433808000,,173,5.142857142857143
6578680,1,B00MHVLA5O,"Too bad too, as we always found the TV series to be really funny and smart. This was just a lame attempt at making a stupid ""13-year old boys"" favorite movie.",1433808000,,158,4.129032258064516
6578681,4,B00MHVLA5O,Really funny,1433721600,,12,5.5
6578682,3,B00MHVLA5O,Okay,1433116800,,4,4.0
6578683,4,B00MHVLA5O,"If you like the Inbetweeners then you'll like this movie.  Watch it in order though- it is the weakest of the TV shows and the movie #1.  Get to know the boys and you will appreciate it.  The pool scene is a laugh riot- probably the best of the entire series for that 'kind of humor'- no spoilers.  I would love to see the boys again- maybe at the end of their Uni career, or as young working blokes a la 'Peep Show'.",1432944000,,417,3.9879518072289155
6578684,3,B00MHVLA5O,Love the in-betweens but this one seemed a little off.  It is funny but no where near as funny as the first one.,1432857600,,112,3.869565217391304
6578685,3,B00MHVLA5O,"If you've seen the TV show or the first movies then you have some sense of what to expect, and if you like those previous versions you will like this. These movies were never very deep, but they really aren't intended to be. The story is about three randy yet hapless teens, though now college age, and their misadventures in seeking love ... or at least in seeking sex and failing spectacularly.  It can be fun movie if you don't take it too seriously.",1431993600,,453,4.392857142857143
6578686,5,B00MHVLA5O,Not as good as the first but worth watching if you've enjoyed the previous and the series.,1431907200,,90,4.352941176470588
6578687,3,B00MHVLA5O,"The boys are back in this latest INBETWEENERS outing. This time they're headed to Australia to join Jay where he claims to be living in a mansion, working as a DJ in a fancy club, and - of course - getting laid by a different lady everyday. Nothing could be further from the truth, but we all expect that from Jay anyway. Hilarity, hijinks, and tons of raunchiness ensue.

INBETWEENERS 2 is exactly what you'd expect out of the INBETWEENERS boys. If you're a fan of the UK series and the previous movie, you'll definitely enjoy this latest. If you aren't familiar with the UK show (NOT the US remake) I'd suggest starting with the series first and then moving your way up to the two movies.

Warning, these are RAUNCHY so do be prepared.",1431043200,,737,4.451851851851852
6578688,5,B00MHVLA5O,The Inbetweeners always delivers. Awesome as usual.,1431043200,,51,6.428571428571429
8672440,5,B00MHVLA5O,"Only works if you saw the series.
Laugh out loud funny.",1532217600,,55,4.090909090909091
8672441,2,B00MHVLA5O,"A little bit funny at the very end, but mostly just a waste of time.  If you don't like cringe humor, you will probably just hate every minute of it.

I guess perhaps, if nothing else, it's probably better than the American Inbetweeners series that aired on MTV, but that's really not saying much.",1530662400,,297,4.481481481481482
8672442,2,B00MHVLA5O,"I loved the first episodes and Film.
The sexual innuendoes and Krass inappropriate behavior were well timed and sparse in these and often hilarious.
Its a bit like swearing, people who swear occasionally in a conversation are often funny.
This Film was just like someone using the C and F word every other word, predictable and Krass.",1514332800,,334,4.87719298245614
8672443,3,B00MHVLA5O,Disappointing movie. Expected a lot more from this group. If you are grasping at straws for something to watch on a rainy day this may fill the slot. But boy it was a stupid plot. I think everyone just wanted a holiday in Australia so there you go.,1507161600,,248,4.1875
8672444,3,B00MHVLA5O,"... and I do, you'll find this palatable.  There's some stupid stuff, some gross stuff, and plenty of typically funny bits too.  If you've watched the series recently, you'll be prepared for some of the cringe-worthy bits; it's been a while since I've seen anything with the boys and I'd forgotten how off-putting these shows/films could get. If you are unfamiliar with the show, this is *NOT* the place to start.  If like me, you have vaguely fond memories of the show, yeah, go ahead, watch.  Just remember how there were plenty of infantile jokes and bathroom humor.",1502064000,,569,4.775510204081633
8672445,5,B00MHVLA5O,My husband loved this movie.  A foreign version of a Something About Mary type humor.,1496361600,,85,4.666666666666667
8672446,5,B00MHVLA5O,Hilarious movie. I loved the tv show and the first movie and this is just as funny as all the other ones.,1484784000,,105,3.8181818181818183
8672447,5,B00MHVLA5O,Funny.,1480032000,,6,6.0
8672448,2,B00MHVLA5O,"This movie shouldn't have been made. The series and the first film were great... and the characters are great. But Inbetweeners 2 must have thought they had to mine grosser stuff to distinguish itself. It's a hard movie to finish.

I will say that the beginning was strong and continues the story line from the first movie. Once they arrive in Australia, it loses its energy.",1477094400,,375,4.681818181818182
8672449,4,B00MHVLA5O,It often tries a little too hard for the gross out humor and uncomfortable laughs but still genuinely entertaining.,1476921600,,115,5.105263157894737
