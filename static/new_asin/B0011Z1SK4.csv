3070720,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I Love, love, love this DVD, and this is the first pilates DVD I have tried.  It is tastefully done for those that have a 'plus sized shape' but yet can still help you as you are ready for more advanced sessions. I cannot say enough good things about how well this dvd has been put together. You can really feel your muscles working after the first session.",1236902400,10,357,4.25
3070721,4,B0011Z1SK4,I really enjoy this dvd as it has provided a nice alternative for practicing Pilates.  The routine takes into consideration how the body does and does NOT bend/flex for some of us who are not a size 4 or 6.  It is nonetheless demanding in that the participant is challenged to be very deliberate in taking on poses.,1235433600,6,315,4.413793103448276
3070722,5,B0011Z1SK4,"This video is a good one for heavy, inflexible people like me. They offer many modified exercises. Even beginners can benefit from this video.",1235001600,7,142,4.958333333333333
3070723,2,B0011Z1SK4,"I bought this because I really wanted to revisit pilates and really liked a plus-sized yoga dvd I had bought.  But the sad truth was that this DVD felt like it was for senior citizens and people with very limited mobility.  I am going to have to sell it because after using a few times I was so bored and not inspired the way I thought I would be.  It makes me want to stick with yoga, as I always feel inspired and refreshed.  Maybe pilates is just not for me.  But truthfully, this DVD was pre-beginner level.  Good instruction but not a challenge even for this beginner.",1229817600,15,573,4.2592592592592595
3070724,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I am a plus size woman and I have always wanted to do Pilates, but was unable to because of my size.  This DVD has allowed me to finally experience Pilates.  I have really enojoyed this workout.  And even though you may feel like you are not getting much of a workout, you are definitely working your muscles.  I highly recommend this DVD to any plus size woman that wants to experience Pilates, but feels that she is too big to do it.",1228348800,78,435,4.204819277108434
3070725,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I love this dvd it's perfect for me! I cannot move as fast as some of the other dvd's have you move but this one is easy and enjoyable, I am very pleased with this purchase.",1228176000,12,173,3.8333333333333335
3070726,1,B0011Z1SK4,"I ordered this product and it came in this case but, I am confused I was looking at the little pamphlet that came with it and it had a list of all the dvds this lady has done. There was one called all day work out with Fern something or other and it had this older women and the instructor on the cover and that is the dvd I got. Confusing I know, I don't get it. So I am not sure if I even got what I ordered. There is a completley different girl on the front of the case and she is not in the dvd.",1219017600,3,499,3.6296296296296298
3070727,1,B0011Z1SK4,"This might be beneficial to people who weigh 600 pounds or more, but otherwise, it feels like you're barely moving at all.  It's quite patronizing, really.  Heavy people can handle a lot more exercise than this.  I almost fell asleep while I was doing them.  What a waste of money.",1216166400,16,281,4.56
3070728,5,B0011Z1SK4,"This DVD was great for me as a busy plus size woman wanting to improve my health, but not the most active person out there to get started.  I found the exercises and Lynn's instruction very easy to follow and I have progressed my fitness level and am now adding some cardio to my routine.  Great purchase!",1208304000,64,305,4.333333333333333
3070729,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I am a certified pilates instructor and I have many clients who will love this matwork. It's a gentle but deep workout that exemplifies all that I love about pilates.
The back to basics section is excellent, and the two main workouts are precise, flowing, and beautifully cued.

There is a morning energizing workout, a midday energizer and a short evening relaxation segment. The emphasis is on ""zipping and hollowing"" the lower abdominals, then adding movements of the limbs to challenge core stability. Several levels of difficulty are demonstrated.

I noticed the instructor includes modifications that will support a larger-sized body without making a big deal out of it. While not a strictly traditional pilates mat workout, the pilates principles are well represented.",1207008000,121,775,5.2926829268292686
3070730,3,B0011Z1SK4,"I want to be able to give this a glowing review, but I just can't.  I'm morbidly obese, but active and work out at the gym regularly.  I like a lot of concepts from pilates, but my weight makes it impossible to do all of the crunches and that sort of thing.  I was hoping for a video that focused more on the pilates moves that don't require curling the upper half of my body off the floor.  If I could do that, I wouldn't need a special dvd for plus sized...  While there are some exercises that do that, there is still a lot of focus on floor exercises that I just flat can't do.  Smaller plus sized people may enjoy it, but don't expect a pilates routine that has been drastically altered to accommodate those of us who can't do the floor work.",1377475200,17,747,4.117241379310345
3070731,5,B0011Z1SK4,Both my daughter and I are just starting out and the DVD is easy to follow and much more friendly workout for the beginners.,1374019200,,124,4.208333333333333
3070732,1,B0011Z1SK4,"The attire the subject had on was distracting.  a flowing billowy blouse not meant for exercising in. at least she could have had on tights and suitable top. it was a terrible DVD. No instruction, just a skinny gal showing a blossomed gal how to do a few pilates.
I ordered Gentle Yoga and think it is awesome.",1372204800,2,310,4.344827586206897
3070733,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I cannot say enough positive things about this DVD.  I keep coming back to it again and again.  The exercises are thoroughly explained, each session is just the right length.  The movements can be difficult but attainable.",1364256000,2,222,4.945945945945946
3070734,2,B0011Z1SK4,"As previously commented, I like the instructions the first few time, but think it would be nice to have the program go straight through with just form prompting and reminders.  It does not contain a lot of exercises and moves slowly.

I know for extreme beginners that is great so that you can get back in touch with your body.  If it had the workout as mentioned above, it would be 5 star.",1363305600,2,390,4.315068493150685
3070735,3,B0011Z1SK4,"It was okay, a lot of talking and wasn't very good.  I switched over to doing yoga, it was more peaceful and not tons of talking.",1362182400,,129,3.9615384615384617
3070736,5,B0011Z1SK4,First of all as a Plus Size woman I was on a quest to find something that I can keep up with while trying to lose the weight and this is so perfect that I recommended to others in our weight loss group on Facebook and not only that it has step by step instructions that are evenly paced and I started this today 2/26/13 and it had me sweating and stretching and Im glad I finally found something that I can keep up with.....so thanks,1361836800,3,433,4.046511627906977
3070737,4,B0011Z1SK4,"I do like this DVD. I wasn't sure what to expect since I've never done Pilates before. However, it's very good for learning how to properly breathe while stretching and doing simple exercises virtually anyone can do. The instructor is very plesant and explains everything quite clearly. A very instructional DVD. I would recommend this product.",1358726400,,344,5.160714285714286
3070738,5,B0011Z1SK4,The video is a great beginner tool for those who have not exercised in awhile.  She gives you both beginner and more intermediate instrustion. I love it!,1352505600,,153,4.666666666666667
3070739,5,B0011Z1SK4,"I am overweight and yet my favorite exercise is Pilates or Yoga, but the problem with most DVDs is that you cannot watch the screen and accomplish the positions before the instructor is off doing the next pose.  Lynne Robinson does talk a lot, but it isn't a problem as she has such a lovely accent and gives you tips of where you should be positioned for each pose.  This helps the viewer to not hurt their necks as they try to watch and do at the same time. The truly confusing thing was that the model on the front cover is no where in the video. But it doesn't matter too much as Lynn and Fern are fine. They divide the video into 3 parts- morning, lunch, and evening workouts. The morning is the only challenging one, the lunch one is nice if you sit in an office all day, and the evening one is really nice for a stretch and a bit of relaxation.

I would say that this is a great introduction video and is especially good for truly out of shape people, the beginning is challenging enough for a novice or a rather inflexible person.  For people who have gone to classes or who are in shape they would probably want a more challenging video.",1339027200,6,1146,4.219178082191781
3070740,3,B0011Z1SK4,"I bought this because it was recommended. I am overweight (BMI is 39) and have a hard time doing the same exercise DVDs I used 50 pounds ago.

This DVD is designed for people who are completely inactive and are overweight. I am out of shape but I do farm chores (cleaning stalls, hauling water, moving hay) and have two kids that I have to chase around so I found this workout WAY too slow and haven't used the DVD except once.",1326499200,6,427,4.2073170731707314
3070741,4,B0011Z1SK4,"In the past ten years, Pilates has been publicized as a way for already fit people to further strengthen their bodies.  I've talked to a lot of people who don't realize that it was originally designed for active people to recover from an injury, making it also a great system for out of shape and, most notably, inflexible people.  So why shouldn't plus-size people also benefit from it?  I have a back/shoulder/neck injury that keeps me from following the likes of Mari Windsor and Ana Caban, but I've always favored Pilates for my morning workout.  Lynne Robinson does a great job and it's nice to see how different it looks when a larger person does these exercises.  If you like this, but want to graduate through different levels, also check out Gaiam's Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason.",1300492800,19,816,4.8
3070742,3,B0011Z1SK4,"This is supposed to be for plus sized women, but I find that it is too advanced for me.  The lady in the video is plus sized, but she is very strong.  I can't do what she does without straining my back.  I can't do these workouts every day or else I will get injured, so I alternate them with other things.

The lady who is demonstrating the exercises is plus sized, but not obese.  She has a relatively flat belly that does not get in the way of the exercises and so if you have a large belly there is really no practical suggestions as to how one might adjust to allow for that.  PILATES HAS SEVERAL POSITIONS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A LARGE BELLY THAT GETS IN THE WAY.  THE EXERCISES ON THIS VIDEO DO NOT ADJUST FOR THAT AND DO NOT SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE POSITIONS.  The woman who demonstrates the exerses is also very strong and fit - so this is really standard Pilates with a larger than average woman demonstrating.  There is nothing in particular in the choreography itself to address the issues of truly overweight, injured, out of shape or otherwise physically challenged people.  If you buy this expecting to find a pre-beginner starting place for exercise then you might be disappointed and discouraged.  There are two fitness levels demonstrated and even the easiest level is a challenge for me.

I checked it out of my local library before purchasing so I could determine if it is usable to me and I suggest you do the same.  It is a stretch, but if I am careful I can use it under the direction of a professional pilates teacher.  Please do not try this before hiring a qualified pilates instructor for at least 10 lessons.  It is very VERY difficult for a physically challenged person to find a beginning exercise routine that will not threaten to injure an already out of shape body and this one has the potential to do more harm than good.  THIS VIDEO IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED AN EXCEEDINGLY ELEMENTARY STARTING PLACE, NOR IS IT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO START OUT WITH NO PROFESSIONAL HELP.

The advantage is that the video contains 3 complete workouts that are only 15 minutes long and are therefore good for people who are busy.  If you have time and are fit enough, you can do all three, but if you are not fit or are pressed for time, you can choose only one at a time, HOPEFULLY WITH QUALIFIED HELP.

I give it only 3 stars because their definition of plus sized is too small for me and it did not address my particular problems.",1283126400,61,2492,4.401746724890829

3070744,5,B0011Z1SK4,Simple exercises and breathing techniques.  Good for older and heavier people. I practice the breathing and do some of the exercises at work on my lunch break.,1281312000,,159,4.888888888888889
3070745,2,B0011Z1SK4,"Found the workout overall less intense than regular yoga videos, but not geared towards plus size women. I thought the video was going to show me how to do certain exercises in a different way so that I had no pain. However, I have low back pain and I have heard that pilates and yoga can be very helpful. However, this video was very difficult to do because I am so plus-size. They should have just called it something different than having plus size in description.",1278633600,8,467,4.441860465116279
3070746,2,B0011Z1SK4,"This is a great intro video for someone who has NEVER done pilates.  However I have and was disappointed that it was not at all what I was looking for.  I have done pilates in my lighter days and looking for additional pilates instruction specific to a new plus size body!  Therefore I was misled by the product description.  After previewing it to determine it was not for me, I would like to return it. Would you be able to assist with that return?  Thanks",1276041600,5,458,4.341176470588235
3070747,2,B0011Z1SK4,"I like the exercises, but Lynne Robinson does far too much talking and explaining between the exercises. I don't really feel like I am getting a workout. I have done it enough times where now I am just going on to the next one while she is still explaining. I use this in conjunction with the ""Hatha Yoga"" and ""Yoga for the Rest of us"".",1265241600,7,336,4.184615384615385
3070748,2,B0011Z1SK4,"I was very excited to get the DVD. I enjoy doing Rodney Yee's AM Yoga, and can do most of his poses, so I figured I was ready to move on to Pilates. I'm morbidly obese, which causes my belly to get in the way, so I was looking for a workout that would work around it. This DVD had great reviews, however, I was very disappointed when I sat down to watch it.

* It's very boring and the instructor talks too much.
* Where is the actual workout? I was hitting X2 on the remote, scanning for actual exercising. It seemed mostly to be an educational DVD, teaching poses, but not actually working the body while it plays. I don't have all day to sit and wait for an instructor to stop talking and get down to business, or demonstrate 1 pose and taking 5 minutes to do it.

I'm sticking with Rodney Yee. I wish I could buy Megan Garcia's Just My Size Yoga, but now that it's discontinued, people are seriously price gouging. But if you have the patience of a saint and can't move very much, then this DVD just might be for you. It's just too slow for me, and of course, being my size, I never dreamed of the day I'd ever say a workout was too slow for me.",1259366400,24,1149,4.057268722466961

I've talked to a lot of people who don't realize that it was originally designed for active people to recover from an injury, making it also a great system for out of shape and, most notably, inflexible people.  So why shouldn't plus-size people also benefit from it?  I have a back/shoulder/neck injury that keeps me from following the likes of Mari Windsor and Ana Caban, but I've always favored Pilates for my morning workout.  Lynne Robinson does a great job and it's nice to see how different it looks when a larger person does these exercises.  If you like this, but want to graduate through different levels, also check out Gaiam's Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason.",1300492800,19,816,4.8
3305239,3,B0011Z1SK4,"This is supposed to be for plus sized women, but I find that it is too advanced for me.  The lady in the video is plus sized, but she is very strong.  I can't do what she does without straining my back.  I can't do these workouts every day or else I will get injured, so I alternate them with other things.

The lady who is demonstrating the exercises is plus sized, but not obese.  She has a relatively flat belly that does not get in the way of the exercises and so if you have a large belly there is really no practical suggestions as to how one might adjust to allow for that.  PILATES HAS SEVERAL POSITIONS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A LARGE BELLY THAT GETS IN THE WAY.  THE EXERCISES ON THIS VIDEO DO NOT ADJUST FOR THAT AND DO NOT SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE POSITIONS.  The woman who demonstrates the exerses is also very strong and fit - so this is really standard Pilates with a larger than average woman demonstrating.  There is nothing in particular in the choreography itself to address the issues of truly overweight, injured, out of shape or otherwise physically challenged people.  If you buy this expecting to find a pre-beginner starting place for exercise then you might be disappointed and discouraged.  There are two fitness levels demonstrated and even the easiest level is a challenge for me.

I checked it out of my local library before purchasing so I could determine if it is usable to me and I suggest you do the same.  It is a stretch, but if I am careful I can use it under the direction of a professional pilates teacher.  Please do not try this before hiring a qualified pilates instructor for at least 10 lessons.  It is very VERY difficult for a physically challenged person to find a beginning exercise routine that will not threaten to injure an already out of shape body and this one has the potential to do more harm than good.  THIS VIDEO IS NOT MEANT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED AN EXCEEDINGLY ELEMENTARY STARTING PLACE, NOR IS IT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO START OUT WITH NO PROFESSIONAL HELP.

The advantage is that the video contains 3 complete workouts that are only 15 minutes long and are therefore good for people who are busy.  If you have time and are fit enough, you can do all three, but if you are not fit or are pressed for time, you can choose only one at a time, HOPEFULLY WITH QUALIFIED HELP.

I give it only 3 stars because their definition of plus sized is too small for me and it did not address my particular problems.",1283126400,61,2492,4.401746724890829

3305242,2,B0011Z1SK4,"Found the workout overall less intense than regular yoga videos, but not geared towards plus size women. I thought the video was going to show me how to do certain exercises in a different way so that I had no pain. However, I have low back pain and I have heard that pilates and yoga can be very helpful. However, this video was very difficult to do because I am so plus-size. They should have just called it something different than having plus size in description.",1278633600,8,467,4.441860465116279
3305243,2,B0011Z1SK4,"This is a great intro video for someone who has NEVER done pilates.  However I have and was disappointed that it was not at all what I was looking for.  I have done pilates in my lighter days and looking for additional pilates instruction specific to a new plus size body!  Therefore I was misled by the product description.  After previewing it to determine it was not for me, I would like to return it. Would you be able to assist with that return?  Thanks",1276041600,5,458,4.341176470588235
3305244,2,B0011Z1SK4,"I like the exercises, but Lynne Robinson does far too much talking and explaining between the exercises. I don't really feel like I am getting a workout. I have done it enough times where now I am just going on to the next one while she is still explaining. I use this in conjunction with the ""Hatha Yoga"" and ""Yoga for the Rest of us"".",1265241600,7,336,4.184615384615385
3305245,2,B0011Z1SK4,"I was very excited to get the DVD. I enjoy doing Rodney Yee's AM Yoga, and can do most of his poses, so I figured I was ready to move on to Pilates. I'm morbidly obese, which causes my belly to get in the way, so I was looking for a workout that would work around it. This DVD had great reviews, however, I was very disappointed when I sat down to watch it.

* It's very boring and the instructor talks too much.
* Where is the actual workout? I was hitting X2 on the remote, scanning for actual exercising. It seemed mostly to be an educational DVD, teaching poses, but not actually working the body while it plays. I don't have all day to sit and wait for an instructor to stop talking and get down to business, or demonstrate 1 pose and taking 5 minutes to do it.

I'm sticking with Rodney Yee. I wish I could buy Megan Garcia's Just My Size Yoga, but now that it's discontinued, people are seriously price gouging. But if you have the patience of a saint and can't move very much, then this DVD just might be for you. It's just too slow for me, and of course, being my size, I never dreamed of the day I'd ever say a workout was too slow for me.",1259366400,24,1149,4.057268722466961
