468391,5,6302456991,"I liked this movie and I think others will like it as well. Fonda is great in the film. He plays a man who was once a sheriff who resigned his post because of reasons he explains in the film and becomes a bounty hunter. He comes to a town where a young man with no experience is the sheriff. He comes bringing the dead body of a man who he hunted for bounty, for $500. The film focuses on Fonda teaching the young man how to be a sheriff. The sheriff is faced with a brutal man who wants to be the sheriff.
Van Cleff has a small part as a villain, and one can see why he later became a star.",1480291200,,591,3.813008130081301

I felt the movie had a fairly typical story line.  Good verses evil, a town bully, a young sheriff needs the help of an older, jaded, ex lawman.  There is a lady involved who is white and had a relationship with a Native American.  As such, she is held in disdain.  So there is the morality aspect of racism and prejudice.

I certainly feel this is a good, but not great movie and I am glad I saw it.  Thank You...",1479600000,,577,4.0265486725663715

468395,5,6302456991,"Four and a half DANGEROUS Stars. This is the excellent, black and white, 1957 Western production of ""The Tin Star"" starring Henry Fonda as the bounty hunter Morgan Hickman. When he brings a dead outlaw with a bounty on his head to young, inexperienced Sheriff Ben Owens played by Anthony Perkins, he sees the Sheriff needs help. Hickman also immediately gets fearful resistance from the law abiding town folk. The sheriff gets training from ""Morg"", who also befriends a widow and son. The laid-back early pace becomes faster, amid underlying themes of intolerance, suspicion, ignorance, friendship, and mounting danger. This movie stands up well to 21st Century viewing. Featuring a superb cast of Fonda, Perkins, Betsy Palmer, and Michael Ray; co-starring Neville Brand and John McIntire; with Mary Webster, Lee Van Cleef, and Mickey Finn. From a story by Barney Slater and Joel Kane. Music by Elmer Bernstein. Costumes by Edith Head. A Perlberg-Seaton Production. Directed by Anthony Mann. Highly Recommended.

While waiting for his reward money, Fonda befriends a woman, played Betsy Palmer, and her son, whose father was an Indian.  Sheriff Ben Owens, Perkins, asks Fonda, Morg the Bounty Hunter, to teach him to be a good Sheriff.  Fonda reluctantly agrees and encourages Owens to not be a Sheriff.  The interaction between the characters is great and it is an excellent movie.  The Friendship that develops between Morg and Kip, Betsy Palmer's son is very believable and genuine.  There is also the relationship that develops between Morg and Nora, Kips mom.

The film is good but formatted so that it does not stand out in the western genre of the period, that being said what I like about the film includes the performance of a superior character actor Neville Brand. Mr. Brand made a specialty of vicious villainous characters that viewers love to hate and in this film he is in great form. The ending of the film would have been better if Mr. Brands Character had been humiliated rather then meet his end in the usual 50's era style. Betsy Palmer also suffers from the clich of 50's era women of the west, her performance  is thoughtful and she conveys a lot with facial expression and body language that leaves one to wonder why such a short leading lady career. The cinematography is an education on how to bring to life the black and white western.

In cinematic terms, the film's strong point is the opening 25"" where the antagonism is set up between the bounty hunter and the townspeople, and we see a vulnerable young sheriff living on borrowed time. This gets fine cinematic treatment. But the remainder of the film constantly comes across as a story that doubtless was a great read, but was never given THE CINEMATIC IMAGINATION THAT CAN CONVERT IT TO THE DIFFERENT REALM OF THE SILVER SCREEN.  I could never throw off the feeling that I'm watching something still trapped in the pages of a book and I'm getting a non-cinema paraphrase. I learned from the other reviewers here that it won a prize for scriptwriting, but I suspect this was a recognition of literary merit by judges who read it as a literary piece separate from the film. One notices that the film won no awards in cinematic terms. This bookishness crucially compromised the film for me and I can't help thinking a greater insistence on cinematic/dramatic elements would've lifted the film beyond the 3* rating I give it here.

Henry Fonda is Morg Hickman, a bounty hunter who brings in a robber and waits to collect the reward. The town doesn't like him: there's no room at the inn, no stable for his horses. But Betsy Palmer, the widow who lives on the edge of town with her half-Indian son, gives him a room.

Perkins persuades Fonda to teach him how to do the job of sheriff after he discovers that Fonda had been a sheriff years ago, and got out of him the reason why he quit to take up bounty hunting. I won't spoil that story.

So of course Perkins ends up a good sheriff, but along the way there's plenty of adventures and unexpected turns for the whole town, including the doc, the robbers up in the hills, and the widow's son. I enjoyed this film, mostly because the people seem real (well, the ones we get to know, anyway), and the story is quite original in places. I appreciate that there's a lot of repetition of certain elements in any western; that's how the west was won, as they say. But combining them in unusual elements, and making characters you can't always predict how they will act, along with characters you care what happens to them, adds up to a good story.",1337385600,,1289,4.300411522633745

This is a rather stark, laconic, classic western, of the style of John Ford.  And even though Mann may have taken second seat to him after the war, he would go on to make westerns no less interesting, with the Tin Star as one of them.  Rather similar to Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""; these two can be purchased and enjoyed side-by-side.

468644,5,6302456991,"The Tin Star is full of Anthony Mann's typical plays on perspective and symmetry, the cinematic possibilities of which few other directors have ever really grasped - not merely visual but emotional and thematic as well (the opening shot is repeated in reverse as the closing shot, but with an entirely different meaning). Although it's set mostly in the town limits as Henry Fonda's embittered bounty hunter finds himself reluctantly passing on tips to the temporary sheriff (Anthony Perkins, still a nice, awkward young guy here before a lifetime of psychopathic typecasting), his great use of location to define and place characters is omnipresent: check out the great sheriff's office with its huge window overlooking the town which puts both men at the heart of the town while effectively keeping them outside it. Indeed, the film is all about outsiders either trying to belong or trying to dominate, throwing in a surprising subplot about racism that allies its misfits and broken angels.

Fonda makes a superb replacement for Stewart (the director and his favored star fell out on Night Passage), Neville Brand's tough bad `un, who wants Perkins' badge for a hunting license, makes a worthy adversary and the final showdown is brilliantly staged, and Elmer Bernstein's score is a definite plus (and a world away from the south of the border energy of his post-Magnificent Seven genre efforts).

This film doesn't have as much action as the films Mann did with Stewart but it has some great writing from Dudley Nichols who colloborated with another fine Western director, John Ford, on several films and rich characterizations from John McIntire as a elderly town doctor, Betsy Palmer as a young widow with an half breed child and Neville Brand as the bully/antagonist of the town. I believe the film also received an Oscar nomination for best writing but I think Fonda should've received one for Best Actor as well.

468698,5,6302456991,"Anthony Mann was known for the great hardbitten Westerns he made with frequent collaborator James Stewart, such as The Naked Spur, Winchester '73, The Man From Laramie, and others. But he did make one Western with Stewart's best friend and another Western movie stalwart, the great Henry Fonda.

Fonda comes into a small town with an outlaw dead over a saddle. He's a bounty hunter, formerly a lawman who has become cynical with life and justice, and prefers the pay and independence of bounty hunting to being a town marshal. The town has a young and very inexperienced sheriff, played by Anthony Perkins, who is struggling to hold the town together as a bigoted bully played by Neville Brand tries to force his way into the sheriff's office. Fonda takes a liking to Perkins, and tries to show him the tricks of the trade. When two half-breed brothers kill the town doctor, events spiral out of control.

The Tin Star is full of wonderful performances, from Fonda who sees in the idealistic Perkins the younger man he used to be and learns to love again thanks to Betsy Palmer, who plays a widow who has a half-breed son; to Perkins, who hits the right notes as someone who'll make a fine lawman if his dumb mistakes don't kill him first, and Brand as a menacing, hateful brute who runs over as many people as he can. John McIntire (another frequent Mann collaborator) is also great as the town doctor.

This is an all-time classic. Don't miss it.",1174435200,22,1448,4.626459143968872
468699,5,6302456991,"The contribution made by Henry Fonda to classic Westerns is incredible : he made his point early with ""The Oxbow Incident,"" his potent presence in ""Drums Along the Mohawk""... He was excellent as Wyatt Earp in ""My Darling Clementine,"" even better as the stubborn, mistaken lieutenant-colonel in ""Fort Apache "" a legendary gunman in ""Warlock"" and the hardened gunfighter-tutor in Anthony Mann's ""The Tin Star.""

Fonda plays a solitary-bounty hunter (""I'm not the law. I work inside it for money!"") who had once been a sheriff, and who had given up the badge in disgust of the shameful way he had been treated by the citizens in a decisive tragic moment of his life--for which he lost his wife and son...

Fonda is quiet, sure, polite, sincere and appealing... Teaching Michael Ray, it was clear that he knew not only his guns but human nature... He is human, kind, anxious, worry and tender with the young boy...

Anthony Perkins is attractive in his doubts about taking action or decision... He is nave and innocent, also incompetent for the job of an officer responsible for law and order... He always looks to Fonda for leadership, but he is eager to be a firm sheriff...

The conversation between Fonda and Perkins are the heart of the movie, which deals more with character than Gunplay: ""You got to keep cool and have absolute confidence. You lack confidence."" ""A decent man does not want to kill. But if you're gonna shoot, you shoot to kill."" ""Study men. A gun is only a tool. You can master a gun if you got the knack. Harder to learn man.""

The film had racism: When Bogardus kills the Indian, in the back, outside the saloon, he says: ""No sheriff will disarm a white man for shooting a mingy Indian. You, an Injun lover?""

Betsy Palmer plays Nona Mayfield, a woman compelled to live outside the town because she married an Indian: ""I'm just so used to everybody hating Indians.""

The film had also intuition and humor:

- Kip Mayfield to Fonda: ""Don't I look like a sheriff?"" And Fonda replying: ""You look more like a sheriff than the sheriff does.""

Abbe Pickett, after being a father for eleven girls and now to a boy, asks: ""You sure it ain't another girl?"" and the doc replies: ""Well, I hope I'm not too old to know the difference.""

John McIntire is fine as the old doc whose big dream was: ""I wish you two to get together.""

Neville Brand enjoys oppressing, intimidating and persecuting...

Anthony Mann's ""The Tin Star"" is strong on location work, tense, realistic, technically competent... The film had dusty action, and a picturesque old town with its bank, hotel, saloon, jail, hanging tree and all the cowardly citizens turned out to watch...

With elements of ""Shane,"" and ""High Noon,"" the film is a very good Western, 'as classic as you can get.'",1162944000,3,2768,4.670781893004115
468700,5,6302456991,Fonda reluctantly takes up the father figure role breaking in Perkins as the town's new sheriff. This minor looking film contains a thoughtful script and good character development. Elmer Bernstein's early Western film score enhances this tale endearingly.,1142899200,,256,5.7631578947368425
468701,5,6302456991,"The Tin Star is full of Anthony Mann's typical plays on perspective and symmetry, the cinematic possibilities of which few other directors have ever really grasped - not merely visual but emotional and thematic as well (the opening shot is repeated in reverse as the closing shot, but with an entirely different meaning). Although it's set mostly in the town limits as Henry Fonda's embittered bounty hunter finds himself reluctantly passing on tips to the temporary sheriff (Anthony Perkins, still a nice, awkward young guy here before a lifetime of psychopathic typecasting), his great use of location to define and place characters is omnipresent: check out the great sheriff's office with its huge window overlooking the town which puts both men at the heart of the town while effectively keeping them outside it. Indeed, the film is all about outsiders either trying to belong or trying to dominate, throwing in a surprising subplot about racism that allies its misfits and broken angels.

Fonda makes a superb replacement for Stewart (the director and his favored star fell out on Night Passage), Neville Brand's tough bad `un, who wants Perkins' badge for a hunting license, makes a worthy adversary and the final showdown is brilliantly staged, and Elmer Bernstein's score is a definite plus (and a world away from the south of the border energy of his post-Magnificent Seven genre efforts). Mann's last great Western, it deserves to be better known.

Sadly, no extras - not even a trailer.",1141516800,,1498,5.060728744939271
468702,4,6302456991,"Although John Ford is the most celebrated director of Westerns in cinema history, Anthony Mann comes very close to being his coequal.  Although Mann directed no single film as superb as either STAGECOACH or THE SEARCHERS, the string of outstanding Westerns he made in the fifties, most notably with Jimmy Stewart, surpass the work of any director not named Ford.  THE TIN STAR is far from his best film from this period, but the fact that he made six or seven that were better shows how completely he mastered the genre.

The main Anthony Mann actor was, of course, Jimmy Stewart, but in THE TIN STAR Mann turned to Stewart's best friend Henry Fonda to play an experienced bounty hunter.  When he brings the corpse of a fugitive he was forced to kill to a town sheriff in order to collect the reward money, he finds himself pulled into the affairs of the town.  He befriends first the small boy of a local widow, then the widow, and eventually the town sheriff, played by Anthony Perkins a few years before PSYCHO.  The relationship between Fonda, the ex-sheriff and veteran bounty hunter, and the idealistic and determined but inexperienced Perkins is very much a mentoring one, with the former gradually imparting the lessons necessary to succeed in his vocation.  It is a very circumscribed story and as a whole less ambitious than Mann's other films.

The film is filled with a number of talented character actors, including WW II war hero Neville Brand, who was one of the great heavies of the era.  John McIntire, who specialized in underhanded and shifty town leaders in his long career, here plays a 75-year-old kindly town doctor (McIntire was in his forties at the time).  Lee Van Cleef shows up as one of the bad guys of the film.

I found this as a whole to be a step below Mann's usual Westerns in part because of the lack of depth with which the psychological aspects of the story are dealt.  We understand that Fonda's character has withdrawn from life because of personal disappointment, but it isn't made clear why he is able to reestablish connections in this one.  In other Mann Westerns, much or most of the delight is watching the central character struggle with an inner transformation.  Jimmy Stewart in THE NAKED SPUR goes through emotional and psychological chances that we can watch on the screen.  The difference might lie in the two actors.  For all his talent, Fonda tended to present a poker face, while Stewart could register all sorts of inner turmoil on his face.  I am not arguing that Stewart is a better actor than Fonda, but that his particular strengths might have been better suited to this kind of role than Fonda's.

Nonetheless, this is a first rate Western that any fan of the genre or of Fonda or of Anthony Mann should definitely catch.",1126310400,2,2781,4.675564681724846
468723,5,6302456991,"Henry Fonda and Anthony Perkins star in ""The Tin Star"", a top flight and thought provoking western that evoked compassion, fear and sensitvity.

Fonda is his typically effective fashion played Morgan Hickman, a mature and confident bounty hunter who entered an unwelcome town to collect the reward on an outlaw he had killed and brought in.  Literally run out of town,  Fonda gets befriended by a young half breed boy Kip, whose mom Nona played by Betsy Palmer, offers him food and shelter.

The town had recently elected young and inexperienced Ben Owens played by Anthony Perkins, as its sheriff. The job was more than he could handle.  Swallowing his pride Perkins sought out the advice of Fonda who had served for many years as a sheriff.  Fonda began to mentor Perkins teaching him the finer points of law enforcement and dealing with people and in the process rediscovers his purpose in life.

Fonda's lessons were well learned as the town exploded when kindly and aged Doc McCord was shot and killed by the renegade McGaffey brothers inciting a riotous and uncontrolled posse.  Fonda cames to Perkins rescue in capturing the brothers and preventing them from being lynched, trying to insure a fair trial.

Neville Brand was perfectly cast as prejudiced town rabble rouser and loudmouth Bart Bogardus, who had eyes on Perkins job and was a prickly thorn in his side.

Director Anthony Mann deftly created a plot that seemed more realistic than the usual mindless heroic westerns we've become accustomed to.  He accomplished this by imbuing his characters with emotion and sensitivity and putting them in situations where conflict allowed these feelings to flow.  Henry Fonda again proves how positively natural his screen performances tend to be.",1126051200,,1752,5.024221453287197
468724,4,6302456991,"It's surprising to me to see The Tin Star (1957), directed by Anthony Mann, released on DVD before some of his other, better westerns like The Naked Spur (1953), The Man from Laramie (1955), or Man of the West (1958) but then I know not of all the ins and outs of the processes that go into getting films released on DVDs.  I do know studios often set schedules well in advance, dealing with all kinds of legal rigmarole, securing rights or what have you and all that...but I digress...directed by Anthony Mann, the film stars Henry Fonda (Mister Roberts, 12 Angry Men) and Anthony Perkins (Psycho).  Also appearing is Betsy Palmer (horror fans may know her as Mrs. Vorhess from the Friday the 13th series), Neville Brand (D.O.A., Stalag 17), John McIntire (The Asphalt Jungle, Winchester '73), and Lee Van Cleef (The Quiet Gun, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral).

Fonda plays ex-lawman/bounty hunter Morgan `Morg' Hickman.  As the film begins, we see Morg riding into town with another fellow who seems to have gone the way of the Dodo...that being extinct...seems the recently deceased was a wanted man, and is now being brought into town for the bounty.  The town is less than hospitable towards Morg's type, offering none of the pleasantries one would normally afford to a visitor, but that matters little, as Morg's just interested in getting paid.  He does make friends with a local outcast named Nona (Palmer) and her half-breed son, and they allow Morg to stay until authorization for his payment comes through.  Soon after Morg's arrival, the local sheriff, named Ben Owens (Perkins) request help in the form of advice on, well, how to be a sheriff.  You see, Ben, a complete greenhorn if you ever saw one, is substituting after the death (by lead poisoning, if you get my drift) of the last sheriff, who also happened to be Ben's girlfriends father...which brings up a whole subplot about how she won't marry Ben until he gives up being sheriff, but Ben is young and idealistic, and refuses to turn his back on his accepted responsibility, despite the complete lack of support from the town elders (they are truly a bunch of jackholes, scurrying at the first sign of trouble).  Ben needs sheriffin' lessons bad, as not only does he have to deal with the towns hotheaded, racist a-hole instigator Bogardus (Brand), but the trouble soon to follow.  Morg's recommendation to Ben is to quit, but seeing that's not going to happen he does agree to give Ben a few pointers, but will it be enough to keep the young, inexperienced lawman alive (given the formulaic nature of the story, I would guess yes, but you'll just have to watch and see)?

While I did enjoy this film, the weakest part for me was the conventional and often predictable nature of the story, which was actually nominated for an Oscar.  How many clichs can one fit into a film?  The disillusioned ex-lawman, the young, inexperienced, surely to be killed sheriff and his girlfriend who won't marry him because she thinks his profession too dangerous, the crotchety country doctor, the town bully threatening the new sheriff for control, the widowed woman raising her son, ostracized by the community because of his lineage, etc.  That being said, the strengths lie in the strong performances of the main actors and the extremely capable direction of Mann.  You can't help but like Fonda's character of the disillusioned ex-lawman, telling the younger Perkins to forgo the life he's chosen, but willing to assist as he sees in Ben what he once was, an idealist in a harsh and unforgiving reality (or, to put it another way, young, dumb, and full of...well, you know), fostering a psuedo father/son relationship.  Despite his lack of confidence in the young man, he offers his limited assistance willingly, as deep down he feels a kinship with the character, a spark of innocence he thought long extinguished within himself.  Have you ever seen a bad Henry Fonda performance?  He's just fun to watch, and always makes it look easy.  Perkins plays his role very well, not going overboard, but staying in the boundaries of a realistic character.  The other actors provide strong support, despite the stereotypical characters.  I think my favorite part was when Fonda's character was giving the young sheriff tips on shooting, and just the study of a situation in general, especially aspects dealing with confronting criminals.  This is also a common element in a number of westerns, but Fonda pulls it off so well, setting the clich, rather than following it.  Also, there's a decent and capable musical score by the legendary composer Elmer Bernstein (not his best, but then again a good effort by Bernstein is still better than most).  I thought the racial theme, with regards to the scene where Betsy Palmer's character reveals her sons heritage to Fonda's character, a little heavy handed, and perhaps a more subtle approach would have worked better, but either way, the point is made.  I found the slightly misogynistic undertones funny, but not unrealistic, especially in the scene where the town doctor (McIntire) is trying to convince Ben's girlfriend her duty is to get married, keep quiet, and start making with the babies.  And that brings me to the ending...break out the pancakes because there's no shortage of maple syrupy sappiness here...I don't have a problem with happy endings, but to see everything tied up so neatly seemed like the easy out...or maybe I'm too cynical for my own good...if only things in real life worked out so well.

The wide screen anamorphic print on this DVD is very sharp and clear, and the audio excellent in restored mono, Dolby Digital 5.1, and Dolby Surround.  There are English subtitles, but nothing else in the way of special features.  All in all, a very solid, often predictable westerner that takes very few chances, but does entertain, worthy of 3  stars.

He hangs around town to wait for his reward.  It is quickly obvious that the young and callow local sheriff (Anthony Perkins) needs some mentoring. Slowly, albeit reluctantly, the older, wiser and far more cynical Fonda fills that role. It is revealed that Fonda was once idealistic young marshal himself. A feature of TS is 2 separate showdowns: In the first Fonda and Perkins force two bad guys out of a cave and bring them to justice- alive. One of them is veteran black hat Lee Van Cleef. Then the grown up Perkins stands down a lynch mob and insists on the proverbial ""fair trial"" for Van Cleef and his partner.  If this review strikes the reader formulaic, TS is anything but. It is tightly directed by Anthony Mann, who helmed such great Jimmy Stewart oaters as, ""Winchester 73"" and ""The Man From Laramie"". Fonda's grit reminded this reviewer of his role as Wyatt Earp in ""My Darling Clementine"".  And the unsupportive townspeople were just like those who walked away from marshal Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"". (Van Cleef played a heavy in that classic as well).

468726,5,6302456991,"Henry Fonda was one of the greatest movie actors ever -- sometimes I think that he was THE greatest. Somehow Fonda managed to BE whomever he was playing, with no hint that he was acting, despite the wide variety of roles he played over his long career.
In The Tin Star Fonda is superb as an embittered ex-sheriff turned bounty hunter who scoffs at naive but dedicated Anthony Perkins, the newly-appointed sheriff in a town to which Fonda has come to collect the reward for an outlaw he has killed. While waiting in town for his reward money to arrive, Fonda reluctantly mentors Perkins in the art of being an effective sheriff and staying alive while doing it. There is a subplot involving Fonda's developing relationship  with a widow (played by Betsy Palmer) and her half-Indian son. Although there is action in The Tin Star, the movie is primarily about the relationships among the principal characters and how they change each other. This is a very good western -- indeed a very good movie -- in every respect. But Fonda's role makes it outstanding.

468727,5,6302456991,"THE TIN STAR seems to go against Anthony Mann's own formula, not so much for its plot, but in its casting of the principal actor Henry Fonda as the catalyst that motivates young sheriff Anthony Perkins (and the film) to live up to the demands of the position. Fonda's casting and presence as the hero seems to make the role static and less complex when compared to what James Stewart could have brought to the role (Stewart was Mann's usual choice for the leading man in his Westerns). Fonda's character is one of a bounty hunter / ex-sheriff who appears to have no moral ambiguities, thus the apprenticeship of Perkins under Fonda's moral stalwartness brings a very straightforward relationship to these main characters. Visually the film also seems to be limited to the town rather than on the wide unclosed vistas of the open range. This claustrophobic effect seems to repress elements of this otherwise interesting screenplay. However, these are only observed peculiarities to Anthony Mann's usual style. This is still a tightly scripted and enticing Western. The showdown between Perkins and Neville Brand is excellently played out. Elmer Bernstein's early Western score is very absorbing and insightful to the film's narrative. I particularly like Henry Fonda's role and his performance in this film.

Doesn't seem to bother him much, though.  While waiting for his bounty money to come through he becomes involved with a local widder and her young `un and helps set young and clumsy sheriff Ben Owens (Anthony Perkins) on the right track.

But not all people serve to do business privately, and some have to choose public work. One of these tasks is being sheriff in old west. In this movie the figure of the sheriff as a public server is well seen:  a man not very capable as I suppose were almost all, elected between the people of a small village, honest but without real skills to impose the law against dangerous bandits: So then, that famous tin star should weigh terribly. In contrast there is the gunman: he's very able with firearms but in this film shooting exhibitions pass to a secondary plane. The personage played by Henry Fonda basically knows his profession in full and furthermore, it remains in a slight dark the feeling that he doesn't value life too much, nor those of his preys nor his own, as he's a bitter, lonely, disillusioned man of and uncertain age with not much to lose. That quality, paradoxically, gives him an advantage in all fights owing to a quiet, indifferent mood the sheriff can't attain as he wants to live and hates troubles. The sheriff must risk against his will; the gunman afford these risks without much worry and all these isn't only a matter of mastery with the revolver. The two protagonists are very well chosen, contrasting the sober Fonda with the disquiet Perkins, but in the film at the end, the two men have changed.",1084752000,,1541,4.583333333333333

468731,4,6302456991,"In THE TIN STAR director Anthony Mann creates a western variation of the Grizzled Old Vet Teaching the Raw Rookie.  This kind of film has built within it a pre-existing allure for the audience who will want to know if the rookie can learn what his mentor has to teach before crunch time.  Henry Fonda is the veteran who used to be a sheriff before he turned to bounty hunting.  Anthony Perkins is the green as grass newly appointed sheriff of a small western town who wants only to be good enough to be considered a permanent choice.  In strolls Fonda looking for a bounty and what begins as a confrontation between established law and mercenary law soon morphs into a buddy movie.  Each sees in the other either what he could be or what he once was.  For a gunfighter movie, there is surprisingly little gunfighting. Most of the time, the audience gets a crash course in the finer points of being a peace officer.  By the film's midpoint, Perkins wants to know why the Fonda character made the switch from a sanctioned badge to a hired gun.  Fonda, as bounty hunter, tells a riveting tale of how a sheriff whom he once knew well (himself) needed money and had to catch a wanted man for the bounty only to find that when he was paid the money it was too late for the reward to be of any use.
The charm of THE TIN STAR is that it shows a character-driven western, a type that was not used again until Clint Eastwood revived the genre in his pre-DIRTY HARRY days.  Fonda and Perkins bounce off each other in all the right ways.  In supporting roles, Lee Van Cleef, Neville Brand, John McIntyre, and Betsy Palmer add their distinctive style to a beloved genre of the western.  In the extended conversations between veteran and rookie, both learn that a badge has a value unconnected to its metallic composition.
