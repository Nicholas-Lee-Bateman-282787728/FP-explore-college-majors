8155124,5,B000K7J8KG,"On time, undamaged and what I expected. This was bought for my daughter's upcoming birthday. The content will enable her to learn skills that permit her to take full hold of the ability to use products to bring out the natural beauty that resides within her. I see it as as a key to her being able to be the best she can be at her own choosing. I'm sure she'll use these skills to fortify her network of female friends and associates to enhance whatever opportunities that may flow from this end.",1403568000,,496,4.344086021505376

Glad I could find it after I lost it the first time.",1374710400,2,117,3.9166666666666665
8155126,1,B000K7J8KG,I already knew all of these techniques. I am very disappointed with the video. The make-up is exactly what MARILYN MONROE was doing. Alexis invented NOTHING!,1374278400,,157,5.076923076923077
8155127,4,B000K7J8KG,"This is a good make-up dvd for individuals who don't know where to begin with make-up.
Alexis explains the basics and gives you her take on how to give yourself the ""kitten"" look.
I would say that she is a bit of an expert, she has worked for Playboy magazine for years as their
top make-up artist.  She has since moved on to a little show called ""American Idol""!  Pam Anderson
owes her now signature look to Alexis.
  Anyway, even if you know lots about hair and cosmetics, you can still pick up a few tips here.
I never thought I could master the art of false eyelashes, here it's made simple.  I'm not giving
this 5 stars because I think it could have had an advanced portion, so you could grow with your
make-up knowledge.
  From my understanding there was some kind of fall out with Alexis and the company who put this
together.  I don't think the company is still in business, or if it is Ms. Vogel has separated herself
from it. This is worth mentioning if you think your going to be able to buy this make-up.

  If Alexis Vogel ever reads this review, please know that we all want you to write a book,
do another video, and start your own blog or post on youtube so we can follow you
 and learn how to make ourselves a little more kitten like.",1317427200,,1251,4.232067510548523
8155128,5,B000K7J8KG,"I've already gotten so many compliments on my makeup after following Alexis Vogel's instructions.  Another reviewer said that the DVD was a sales pitch but they are wrong.  I'm not using Alexis Vogel's makeup.  I just used similar products that I already owned in similar colors to what Alexis was using.  Then, once I got the hang of it, I started experimenting with different colors while using the same techniques and my makeup just keeps looking better and better.",1303516800,7,468,4.886075949367089
8155129,4,B000K7J8KG,THIS DVD PURCHASE MORE THAN MET MY EXPECTATIONS.  IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR...,1274745600,2,95,4.588235294117647
8155130,1,B000K7J8KG,I was very disappointed with this DVD.  I was told by a friend to get it for instruction--I am a Licensed Esthetician and I take makeup classes and review DVD's etc. to learn about makeup techniques.  There was very little content to this DVD--was really just more of a sales pitch--no real quality. Additionally I feel it is a little dated.,1255478400,4,341,4.573770491803279
