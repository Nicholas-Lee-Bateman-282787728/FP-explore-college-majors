8666836,2,B00LN878G2,"There is really no excuse whatsoever to have lossy DVD-quality audio on a Blu-ray. The picture improvement over the DVD is magnificent, everything is much clearer and there is very little artifacting despite the fast lighting that occurs in many places throughout the set, but the audio is not an improvement at all over the DVD using the same 448 Kbps Dolby 5.1 track. For a show in which the star is second ONLY to the audio, there is simply no excuse I would accept.

Great performance, Tiesto is one of the most recognizable names in the industry, very cool to have an archive of this concert...but if you already have the DVD I don't think you'll want to part with money just for the picture improvements found here.",1411689600,4,721,4.589147286821706
