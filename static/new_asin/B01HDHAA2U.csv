7786075,4,B01HDHAA2U,"So I enjoy a good old slasher film as much as the next horror fanatic, and this one is old hat worth a watch where moronic teenage campers square off a group of slack jawed yokels, takes place in the black hills so I assuming South Dakota has a hillbilly problem. I don't know it's been a while since I've been there and perhaps residents of South Dakota are all rocket scientist brain surgeons - don't need any trigger warning on this review now do we!

Seriously if you just want a pretty fun slasher film this one is worth checking out.  blood, guts, gores, chills seem to be in the right places.",1468195200,2,599,4.292035398230088
7786076,5,B01HDHAA2U,"You might have trouble camping for awhile after watching this well done horror flick. Creepy characters, Miss Elle could make you a little uneasy to say the least. Well executed and the settings really add to the atmosphere. Enjoy!",1468195200,4,231,4.948717948717949

7786082,2,B01HDHAA2U,Entirely ordinary kill-fest with no depictions of voodoo or the like.,1470787200,,69,5.363636363636363
7786083,1,B01HDHAA2U,So bad that I never finished watching it,1470787200,,40,4.125
7786084,2,B01HDHAA2U,"Somewhere between bad and horrific! I've tried to watch it twice and find myself wanting the cast to die sooner in this ""movie"".",1470700800,,128,4.608695652173913
7786085,1,B01HDHAA2U,Not scary. I cannot find a horror movie that is scary,1470700800,,53,3.909090909090909
7786086,2,B01HDHAA2U,"Just looking for a real scarry movie,  this one didn't even make me flinch",1470700800,,74,4.285714285714286

7786088,1,B01HDHAA2U,Stupid movie for stupid people. Don't waste your time or money on this loser.,1470441600,,77,4.571428571428571
7786089,1,B01HDHAA2U,Not worth the time.,1470355200,,19,4.0
7786090,1,B01HDHAA2U,MAYBE THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN OK IF YOU DID NOT USE ALL TRAILER PARK PEOPLE,1470096000,,77,3.875
7786091,4,B01HDHAA2U,"If you're into a fun horror flick you should consider checking out Voodoo Rising. They may not have had the biggest budget in the world, but it's clear that they really enjoy making movies and there's definitely a certain joy in that. Cool special effects and classic horror music help bring it to life.",1470009600,,303,4.62962962962963
7786092,1,B01HDHAA2U,Didn't really like it,1470009600,,21,4.5
7786093,3,B01HDHAA2U,"It was ok. Definitely not the worst horror flick I've ever seen. Decent special effects. Bad acting. Weird script. Campy in a low budget kind of way. I still liked it. I am a horror addict. No really.. I am. Good, bad, in-between. I watch a lot of them. I think it's so cool that people are out there making these things to entertain. I will continue watching because it's what I do.",1470009600,,383,4.260273972602739

7786095,1,B01HDHAA2U,"If you can get past the first 10 minutes it may turn out to be ok. Since the first 10 minutes were so stereotypical bad horror, did not continue.",1469923200,,145,4.0344827586206895
7786096,1,B01HDHAA2U,"The 5 star reviews are fake.  This is the worst film I've seen in a long time.  The acting, casting, camera angles, the score or background music, it's all terrible.  The movie tries to me dark and ominous with warnings from others- ""Don't go to Diamond Creek,"" or whatever.  I often like low budget flicks, but this is effing terrible.  I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  Read all the 1 star reviews and don't waste 15 minutes of your time.",1469750400,,447,4.390243902439025
7786097,2,B01HDHAA2U,This had nothing to do with voodoo.  It's about some stupid kids who do something stupid and get the local yokels pissed off so the locals have an excuse to commit torturous acts to satisfy their blood lust.  Bad acting and stupid plot.,1469664000,,236,4.465116279069767
7786098,1,B01HDHAA2U,"This had virtually nothing to do with voodoo, besides a campfire story and a so-called ""voodoo woman"" who doesn't fit into what barelypasses as a plot.  Just a lot of torture, killing and gore. If there were a 0-star rating it would apply to this.",1469577600,,247,4.488888888888889
7786099,1,B01HDHAA2U,Very boring,1469491200,,11,5.0
7786100,1,B01HDHAA2U,You look too cheap bad acting,1469491200,,29,4.0
7786101,1,B01HDHAA2U,"Pretty close to a home movie I could make, but I think I could get a better script.",1469491200,,83,3.6666666666666665
7786102,1,B01HDHAA2U,"During a full moon with Mercury in retro, a group of young adults opt to go camping in the Black Hills of Garfield, Ohio. They meet hillbilly rednecks with a mentally handicapped son who kills women. And there is that voodoo thing which doesn't play much as a part as the title might suggest.

Amateur film. Poorly scripted. Camp acting. Camera was  like ABC sports, it covers it from every angle but a good one. This is a me-too slasher film. Even the sound was off at times.

Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.",1469491200,2,516,4.468085106382978
7786103,1,B01HDHAA2U,Really?  Could this movie be much worse?  I honestly do not know where they find these movies...,1469404800,,96,4.588235294117647
7786104,4,B01HDHAA2U,"thankful these are actors and not for real people.  One time some hunter threatened to cut me up into pieces and put me in a plastic trash bag like how he did some animal that he just killed.  These people, the creepy Balmer family, don't just talk though.  I watched the whole thing.  Did I like it?  Let's just say I just kept watching and couldn't stop.",1469318400,,356,4.253731343283582
7786105,1,B01HDHAA2U,"Within the 1st 10 minutes this quickly became one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Poor filming, ridiculous dialogue, horrible acting.  Even the opening music is awful and incongruent with the tone of the scene.  Don't be fooled by the 4 star ratings- friends and family of the people involved with this film must have posted the good reviews.",1469232000,,349,4.688524590163935
7786106,1,B01HDHAA2U,"was it suppose to be funny? What a complete work of crap. Are there people in the urban areas really that dumb? Where do they imagine this is suppose to have taken place? Stupid, boring, childish, and not even a movie just that video high school shot garbage. Why does Amazon keep putting this crap on the table.",1469145600,,312,4.396551724137931
7786107,5,B01HDHAA2U,The movie was fantastic. Excellent dialog...ready for anything to happen can't make you ready for this! Just scary!,1469059200,,115,5.444444444444445
7786108,1,B01HDHAA2U,"The most unfounded movie in the world....Stupid beyond belief with not a  connected minute minute. I just kept saying ""what"" as it veered along from right to left making no sense. UGH!",1469059200,,184,4.75
7786109,1,B01HDHAA2U,"I have no idea why this has such a high rating. The cast must have rated it. The acting is horrendous, all the girls are fat, the sound is so bad (there's even moments in the picture where there is no sound at all). Do yourself a favor and don't watch it, just rate it 1 star.",1468972800,,276,3.8596491228070176
7786110,1,B01HDHAA2U,"This is the poor man's ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" -- very poor man's.  Nothing but a bunch of inbred ignorant throwbacks that we hope don't exist any more.  Found it too stupid and irritating to finish it.",1468972800,2,221,4.641025641025641
7786111,2,B01HDHAA2U,just watched the trailer. can't say that I want to see voodoo rising because of it.,1468972800,,83,4.25
7786112,1,B01HDHAA2U,"This was an insult to my intelligence. Terrible acting, ridiculous characters, awful script ... just all-around bad. I turned it off about 10 minutes into watching it.",1468713600,,167,5.222222222222222

7786114,5,B01HDHAA2U,What a picture. Great. Recomend.,1468627200,,32,5.6
7786115,1,B01HDHAA2U,"The ""good"" reviews are either fake or from someone associated with this ""film"". Non actors play a bunch of hideous inbred creeps living in the woods. The targets are a group of youngsters wanting to camp there. You know the rest....YUK",1468540800,9,235,4.7560975609756095
7786116,4,B01HDHAA2U,"Though of Deliverance for a bit when watching this because of the hillbillies vs city folk vibe...but this is bloody! Good classic horror flick set in the woods! Grab the popcorn, turn out the lights and settle in. A fun ride!",1468454400,3,226,4.536585365853658
7786117,4,B01HDHAA2U,An enjoyable take on the rednecks versus young folks horror genre.,1468368000,,66,5.090909090909091
8765136,1,B01HDHAA2U,Could have been okay but ultimately was pretty boring and didn't hold my interest,1528675200,,81,4.857142857142857

8765139,5,B01HDHAA2U,"I love it that millenials are all getting killed, more than youth of yesteryear. Mix that with classic slasher horror elements and themes, and you've got fun.",1472428800,,158,4.888888888888889
8765140,5,B01HDHAA2U,I happen to love this movie! It totally was a throwback to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre! you could tell the filmmakers and cast were having fun highly entertaining fun and at times a bit disturbing!,1472342400,,197,4.6571428571428575
