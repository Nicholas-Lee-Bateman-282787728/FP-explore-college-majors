8507155,4,B006ZOPDXE,"Wow! It is not often that Occidentals get to experience Asian artists presenting a fairly straight forward Western-style opera about primal Chinese history.

As with most filmed documents of live theatrical presentations, the video medium does not do the live theatre experience justice. So I am probably preaching to the choir about such constraints and limitations within the medium.

Once you get past the static viewpoint and the lack of daring to take advantage of what video could have added or revealed, what you do get is high concept of high art and well worth the price if the subject matter of Asian opera is to your taste. But it is certainly cheaper than going to New York or Beijing for opera about life-size pottery or clay soldiers.",1360281600,,748,4.8359375
