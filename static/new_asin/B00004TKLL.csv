7922941,5,B00004TKLL,"This movie remains at the pinnacle of erotic ASMR films, anticipating ASMR by decades.  Negative reviewers must be judging the film strictly by standards of plot and dialogue.  And judged wholly by those standards, who is to say that they do not have an argument.  But the results are a feast of the senses for those looking for sensual erotic escapism, regardless of how implausible the plot may be.  A writer is forced at gunpoint to take dictation of a cautionary tale of a virginal girl who stumbles unwittingly into a highly sexualized ""hotel of desire.""  On a purely sensual level it is first rate.",1508630400,,604,4.714285714285714
7922942,2,B00004TKLL,"This was the wrong ""Honey"". I was looking for the new Italian film about a young woman who helps people die. I would assume it is not out yet for distribution. I will return it. Don't really dislike it, it's just not what I had in mind.",1407628800,,236,4.042553191489362
7922943,4,B00004TKLL,"The original Vestron Tape is right at 89 minutes.

The other reviews here and elsewhere (like IMDB) have it pretty much covered. But please be aware that there is another listing for this VHS film on Amazon, with much lower prices.",1260230400,,231,4.634146341463414
7922944,4,B00004TKLL,"UPDATED DEC-13-2017:

The Amazon streaming version looks just like the VHS tape I reviewed before.  It is cropped to a 4:3 image, in English audio (with optional English captions), runs 84 minutes, and, of course, has mediocre picture and audio quality.  Here is hoping a better edition is forthcoming.  In recent years there have been quite a few Italian erotic dramas and giallo films made into Blu-ray special editions with beautiful restored picture and sound by companies like Arrow, Kino Lorber, and others, so I hope ""Honey"" would be treated likewise someday.

My original January 2001 review of the VHS is below:

I had received a 60-minute version of HONEY, and wrote a review on September 3 to complain about it.  Later I was told I should have been shipped the uncut 90-minute version.  So if you get the short version, return it and ask for the right one.  I was told the mistake was ""doubtful to happen again.""
(I finally got the 90-minute version after the supplier of the tape saw my review and sent me a new tape.)",979776000,17,1030,4.677777777777778
7922945,2,B00004TKLL,"The original film was in Italian, widescreen, and ran 85 minutes.  This VHS tape, however, is dubbed into English, cropped, and runs just 60  minutes (even though the box says it's an 85-minute film).  Buyers  beware.
The film is essentially about a sexual fastasy within a sexual  fantasy.  Effective moments of eeriness and eroticism help somewhat elevate  the material.",967939200,9,372,5.203389830508475
