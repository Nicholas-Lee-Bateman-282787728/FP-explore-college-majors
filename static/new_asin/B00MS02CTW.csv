6600650,4,B00MS02CTW,"I knew little about the Busby Babes and the Munich air disaster that took the lives of 8 young Man Utd players until encountering this film. As a former collegiate player and youth soccer coach, I really appreciate the influence that good coaches have on players. This film highlights that unique player/coach relationship. Brian Cox is superb as the legendary Matt Busby who helps a wayward lad get back on the right track in life through soccer. I'd recommend this to anyone who takes their soccer and their movies seriously. Right after Victory and Damned United, it's the best soccer film I've seen.",1416355200,,603,4.864077669902913
6600651,5,B00MS02CTW,"Saw this movie in theaters - great feel-good movie! There aren't enough soccer movies out there, and this is a great true story about a famous Manchester United coach.  I thought the soccer games were exciting and entertaining to watch, and the acting was very well done.  I'm personally a fan of true stories when they're done right.  Any teens and pre-teens in a soccer league should watch this with their team - this is the perfect movie for a team outing!",1416355200,2,459,4.573170731707317

6600654,5,B00MS02CTW,"Such a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy! Everyone is so good - especially the boy that plays Georgie, the main character in the film. First and foremost, Believe is a soccer movie. Second it is set in the 80's and based around the legendary Manchester United Football Club coach Sir Matt Busby. A really top-notch 80's soundtrack accompanies this superb film.",1415318400,,369,4.78125

6600663,5,B00MS02CTW,"I think this movie is is a five star. It teaches kids that you can score any goal if you have belief, or nothings impossible. I think this will help kids that like futbol (soccer) to play a better game of futbol . Futbol lovers would really like this movie. This may make kids think more possitively  about futbol.

6600670,5,B00MS02CTW,"This is a great true story movie. And its one that you can watch with the whole family, too! It perfectly evokes the England I remember from the early 1980s, as a small boy. Brian Cox always holds your attention, but you're never aware that its Brian Cox, and his work in this film is a perfect example of that. The passion for football (Soccer) that lives within most English children is alive and well in this seven-a-side team that sees it as a natural process of life. The children are exactly the way my football mad friends were, and like us, they're no angels. But you'll love them anyway!",1419897600,,596,4.427272727272728
