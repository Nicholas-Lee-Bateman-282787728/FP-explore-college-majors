556415,4,6303095186,"""Son of Fury"" harkens to the 1930s black and white costume dramas which visually looked like a novel's illustrations come to life. By 1942, that era was over except for this film. The black and white photography contributes significantly to that 1930s feel. Tyrone Power was an okay actor with enormous likeablility and he brings it out strongly in the character of Benjamin Blake. Everyone is first rate with George Sanders in perfect nasty form. The friendship between Power's character and John Carradine's adds significantly to the film. The beautiful Gene Tierney displays wonderful chemistry with Power and brings a naive charm to her island woman. ""Son of Fury"" tells its story in a professional, richly textured and yet lean manner. This movie is high entertainment not to be missed.",1206921600,,791,5.092307692307692
556416,5,6303095186,"Son of Fury heralds the dawn of Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney as a romantic duo that would later become legendary. Beautifully photographed and acted, director John Cromwell kept this classic well within the boundaries set by the script. The film, however, does challenge other boundaries: those of compassion, tolerance and love as the antidote to anger. Son of Fury is the story of one man's quest for justice, vindication and liberation from the cruel bonds of oppression, for himself and others.

  Benjamin Blake (Tyrone Power) fights to claim the estate and title, stolen by usurper Sir Arthur Blake (George Sanders) his uncle, which rightfully belong to him by inheritance. Beginning in childhood, Benjamin is forced to work in the manor's stables as a bonded servant, and subjected to repeated beatings and humiliation. Benjamin and Sir Arthur mirror each other perfectly; Benjamin appearing an outwardly, gruff-looking, smelly stable boy, but inwardly compassionate and noble, while Sir Arthur, scheming and cruel, wears the guise of a polished, perfumed, well-mannered aristocrat. Both characters succumb to fits of fury; one due to outrage at injustice and brutality, the other due to envy, lust for power and privilege. But, Ben possesses an indomitable spirit that Sir Arthur attempts to break time and time again. His nobility is intrinsic, while Sir Arthur's is the labor of violence and fraud. Ben's courage and determination must spell final ruin for the imposter. Rage serves neither of them well; for Ben is always being slapped down, or hounded by the authorities, while Sir Arthur's never succeeds in breaking him.

  Sir Arthur, a true champion in the blue blood boxing ring, does not hesitate to engage in unsportsmanlike conduct when he deems it necessary in defending his other purloined title; no Marquis of Queensbury rules here. On one occasion, he escorts his rival to the stable, and challenges the now grown-up, highly insubordinate Ben to a contest in the manly art of self-defense. As the two remove their jackets, Sir Arthur catches the unsuspecting lad off-guard with a sucker punch; hardly a sign good-breeding. Upon gaining the initiative, Sir Arthur goes on the offensive, and proceeds to pummel the real heir mercilessly. Sensing that fists are inadequate tools of punishment for the intensity of his rage, he horse-whips poor Ben into unconsciousness, and in the process -- nearly passes out himself -- from delirium brought on by the shear fury of the thrashing. Sir Arthur expends his physical and spiritual energy to exhaustion in the course of abusing Ben; a condition observed by those intervening on the young man's behalf. It must be noted that in today's cinema, it is often the protagonist who employs underhanded means to gain the better of an opponent; be it the sucker punch or a shot below the belt (a sign of rage?). At the hands of Sir Arthur, Ben experiences the insufferable tyranny inflicted on the lower classes by high-mind aristocrats, and learns of the need for kindness and humane treatment of his fellow beings regardless of breeding, social status or race.

  By now, Benjamin has had enough, and, risking imprisonment and death decides to escape the estate, and sail away to make his fortune. While fleeing from the long arm of the law, he is sheltered by Bristol Isabel (Elsa Lanchester), a member of the lower class and a woman of questionable repute. Sensing the underlying nobility and kindness within him, being the kind of woman who knows men well, she quickly befriends Ben, and assists him in evading police capture. Elsa Lanchester is lovely, utterly charming; and sparkles in this wonderful performance. Pity, she is mainly remembered for her role as the bride of Frankenstein.

  Benjamin finally gives the police the slip, and signs on to the crew of a merchantman bound for the far side of the world. After more rough treatment on the long voyage at the hands of a surly crew, he jumps ship with Caleb Green (John Carradine), while in sight of a tropical island in the Pacific. Initially, the two receive a rather frosty welcome for such a warm, sunny place. It seems that the natives, none of whom speak English, or any other European language for that matter, have been suffering from white-man fatigue as a legacy of whippings, beatings and plunder from previous visits by seafaring ""traders."" But, one look at Blake's scarred back is enough to convince the chief that his people and these strangers share a common bond, so he embraces them.  At the time this film was released, war in the Pacific was raging. American forces found Pacific islanders eager to cooperate in intelligence operations, for Japanese occupation had left a very bitter taste in their mouths.

  With his feet on terra firma once again, Blake plans to return to England, and oust Sir Arthur. But first, he has to make his fortune by diving for pearls. The shoals around the island, stacked with oysters, yield a rich harvest, however they reveal more than just pearls. Surfacing after one dive, Ben discovers the most beautiful gem, enchanting Gene Tierney, perched on a rock, a ""human mermaid,"" his Eve. Tierney is utterly captivating as the native girl who seduces Blake. During a night-time, gala celebration, she performs a dance that begs to be played over and over again - thank goodness for DVD! In loving her, Blake breaks the racial taboo of miscegenation in an era of intolerance, not only, for the time period of the film, but for audiences of 1942, when war hysteria and xenophobia were whipped up to the fullest. Loyal Americans of Japanese ancestry, among other groups, were incarcerated in US concentration camps for the duration of the war.

  As characteristic of films shot in the pre-dawn years of small screen TV, Son of Fury moves along at a brisk pace, thanks to the adept hands of a talented film editor, and contains none of the time-burning, close-ups and long, idol-worshipping shots so prevalent in later Hollywood films. The cast and crew of this film, possessed with a marvelous sense of equilibrium, did an exceptionally good job of combining all the elements of moviemaking into a well-balanced work. Son of Fury is a splendid example of the economical mastery of media characteristic of great artists. Every shot is a masterpiece of cinematography, every part exquisitely played to the fullest, but never overdone. The quality of video and audio is very good, and does final justice to the story of Benjamin Blake.",1188604800,3,6502,4.981549815498155

556419,5,6303095186,"Tyrone Power gives one of his most entertaining performances in this terrific and exciting story. This one is grand adventure and has all the elements that make films in this genre fun to watch. If this film doesn't make you feel good, I suggest you check for a pulse!

Power is Benjamin, whose rightful place as Duke is suppressed by his slimy uncle, Sir Arthur Blake. George Sanders portrays the gent we love to hate with as much aplomb as Power portrays the dashing and youthful hero in this most delightful and robust of adventure films.

Removed from his grandfather's care as a young boy, Ben grows into manhood under the harsh abuse of Arthur, all the while dreaming of adventure, and revenge. A romance with his uncle's daughter Isabel results in a brutal beating that prompts his escape by ship. Elsa Lanchester has a nice part as Bristol, the kind soul who doesn't belong in Ben's world but helps him get his passage to freedom.

Ben and his mate Caleb (John Carradine) decide to jump ship and swim to shore in beautiful Polynesia, where they discover treasure. One is in the form of pearls and the other is the gorgeous beauty of Gene Tierney, as native girl Eve. The second treasure may be the more valuable in the end, as Ben quite naturally falls in love with her without realizing it.

A youthful Gene Tierney was just coming into her own at Fox and has perhaps never been so gloriously photographed as in Son of Fury. Maybe it's the island outfits or the South Sea sun, but it is hard to remember a film in which she was more breathtaking. She is like a dream come true in this film.

But Ben's dreams are haunted by what has been done to him and he returns to claim his rightful place, only to be betrayed by Isabel (Frances Farmer) before a document surfaces that changes everything. All will not be set right, of course, until Ben deals with Arthur! But what about the waiting island girl Eve?

This lush swashbuckler is a perfect feel good movie for a Saturday morning in bed. This was Tyrone Power at his best, Sanders at his delicious worst, and Gene Tierney at her most beautiful. You can't help but enjoy this film, so you may as well not try.",1114300800,25,2167,4.473417721518987
556420,2,6303095186,"My only reason for seeing this film is to see the real Frances Farmer and Gene Tierney.  Frances Farmer plays ""Isabel"".  Gene Tierney plays ""Eve"" the native girl.  What a cast!  Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, George Sanders, Frances Farmer, Elsa Lanchester, John Carradine and as credited ""Master Roddy McDowall"".  Gene Tierney and George Sanders would later act again together in GHOST AND MRS. MUIR (1947).  Son of Fury was Frances Farmer's last film until 1958.  During the 16-year absence of acting, she had such a troubled life and a troubled mind.  She had been arrested and eventually was against-her-will committed to a mental institution.  A wonderful, dramatic film ""Frances"" (1982) dramatizes the life story of Frances Farmer, played by Jessica Lange.  Frances Farmer had a labotomy and in 1958 returned for one more film, The Party Crashers (1958) which would be her last.  In regards to Roddy McDowall, he was good in any project he was in.

556421,4,6303095186,"'Son of fury' comes from a period in Tyrone Power's career just as he was beginning to explore the darker side of his bland romantic image.  Here he plays a man consumed by vengeance, incestuous desire and envy: the illegitimate son of a peer and a working class woman, he is snatched as a child from his loving maternal grandfather by a dastardly uncle (George Sanders in fabulously, louchely vile form) terrified the young fellow will usurp his title, who makes him a stable boy.  In a remarkably brutal story, he is subjected to vicious bouts of violence, grimly biding his time before he can escape to the New World, make his fortune and return to claim his title.
the film, which plays like 'Les Miserables' rewritten by Robert Louis Stevenson, is neatly divided into three parts.  The first and third are the kind of perverse Georgian/Regency melodramas the British studio Gainsborough were popularising at the same time: vicious, charming aristocratic cads horsewhipping their inferiors; lusty servants violently seducing their swooning mistresses; priapic young bucks fleeing the police and a monstrously unjust legal system; teeming lower class streets, with dingy pubs and tarts with huge souls.
The transition from prurient Britain to puritan America leaves this model surprisingly intact: Power's masochistic submission to beatings and scarrings have an immense charge.  The cultural detail isn't as precise as a British film would be - there isn't the sense of a teeming 18th century England - but this gives a clarity to Power's terrible quest, and the set-design, especially in the interiors staging the masculine squabbles, are spare and beautiful.
Being an American film, the corruption of European 'civilisation', with its vice-ridden aristocracy and arbitrary legal tyranny, where a brave, bright and able young man is spiritually deformed by outmoded social rules, is contrasted with the primitive, though equally hierarchical idyll of Polynesia.  This middle section, calm between the English storms, suffers in comparison with the surrounding, full-blooded action - and Power is made wear some ridiculous togs - but allows director Cromwell insert some subtle irony: Power tries to escape decadent Europe, but he imports its defining characteristics (language, religion, industry etc.).  How long will the untainted idyll survive?  Conversely, the vision of Britain on the verge of its great Empire is almost left-wing!",1001635200,19,2441,5.357702349869451
556492,5,6303095186,"This is an excellent movie from which the premise behind ""Treasure of the Golden Condor"" was produced.

Ben runs away, makes money and comes back and talks to a Lawyer in turn he finds proof that Bens mom and dad are married an he isn't a bastard.  I don't want to give away all the twist and turns of the movie, but one thing, the uncle beats him and the uncle wife helps Ben run away. There is a good reason she helps him.

 Leaving the islands to return to England where he had originally fled from the cruelty of a step-uncle;he outwitted,and consequently regained the fortune of his deceased Father , thereby returning to his Paradise and his true love living ,as they sat, happily ever after!

I use to watch this movie with my dad as a lad on CBS' ""Picture for a Sunday Afternoon"". For those of you younger and or that don't know the show, they use to show all the hot movie classics similar to what TMC does these days. I am so glad that it is available in DVD with good sound and picture quality. The movie story line is fictional and precedes a similar story line staring Cornell Wilde  ""Treasure of the Golden Condor"" which takes place in the Aztec/ Inca areas VS Polynesia. If you like one of these stories you will like the other. Both have a betrayal and stealing of family name, fame and wealthy estate inheritance. In fact I personally think that the Golden Condor was a remake of ""Son of Fury"" changing the treasure from natural pearls to gold and jewels as well as the location of the treasures and ambiance settings. I hope you enjoy this classic movie.

Directed by John Cromwell

When his brother dies, scheming Arthur Blake (George Sanders) kidnaps his own nephew, Benjamin (played as a youth by Roddy McDowall and as an adult by Tyrone Power). Arthur's purpose is to claim his brother's dukedom for himself. Put to work as a stable boy, Benjamin grows up and develops a crush on his own cousin Isabel (Frances Farmer). When Arthur discovers this, he mercilessly beats Benjamin, who runs away and sails to India on a cargo ship to make his fortune. In Polynesia, he and a friend, Caleb (John Carradine), jump ship and set up camp on a tropical island paradise. There, Benjamin and Caleb become rich mining pearls, while Benjamin falls in love with a native girl, Eve (Gene Tierney). Now that he has amassed wealth, however, Benjamin is determined to return to England and get his revenge on Uncle Arthur.

Gloriously photographed in black & white by the great Arthur Miller the picture is also buoyed by a terrific score by Alfred Newman featuring a great swashbuckling main theme and an arresting love motif for the picture's softer moments.

This fabulous period swashbuckler film is based on the adventure novel Benjamin Blake by Edison Marshall, who also wrote The Vikings (1958).
