8325680,1,B000RAFTMM,"VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product! A RIPOFF!

I recommend NOT purchasing this item. The cost is TOO MUCH for the short amount of video time and with only a FEW songs! Appears to be someone's home product.

After happily receiving this CD in a very short time, my expectations crashed.

The CD is TOO SHORT in duration. It shows just one fireplace with someone stoking the fire ever so often, DISTRACTING! Cheap!

On my original Fireplace CD, with a similar cover photo, there are several different types of fireplaces and MUCH more music and a full HOUR of entertainment!

This CD is a complete waste of money!",1323475200,2,612,4.682242990654205
