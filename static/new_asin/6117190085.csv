7802657,1,6117190085,The English translation is terrible. Making this movie totally unwatchable. They should have used the translation that can be found on youtube. Very disappointed. It's a great story but not like this.,1388016000,,200,5.28125
7802658,5,6117190085,"This is the t.v. series to the diary ""1 liter of Tears"" by Kito Aya, it stars Erika Sawajiri as Aya, as opposed to the movie version with Asae Onishi.  Both are excellent and a must see.  The t.v. show does take more liberties with the story, like a love interest for Aya.  The movie is in my opinion more brutal and fast with the disease, while the t.v. show gives you more time with Aya.  If you watch one you will want to watch the other.  T.V. show is hard to find, very surprised Amazon has it in stock, so get it while you can.",1379980800,,533,3.990566037735849
