1588054,3,B00005JPP2,"I don't know whose bright idea it was to make a full-length ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" movie.

Let's face it, the appeal of the Adult Swim TV show is that it's short and insane, and it's entertaining at one A.M. when your brain is getting punchy. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters For DVD"" is rather amusing, but it wears out its welcome with an attempt at a longer, more complex storyline.

After a brief cameo by Mastadon (whom I love), we are shown the Aqua Teens in Egypt, where the levitating fry cup Frylock is killed by a giant dog. Timid Meatwad and sociopathic Shake attempt to have him revived by the Time Lincoln, except that they're being attacked by government agents.

Turns out it was all one of Shake's lies. Annoyed, he goes off to build his Insane-o-Flex, which Frylock discovers is an evil machine that will cause the eventual extinction of the human species. The Cybernetic Ghost Of Christmas Past From The Future explains that he has removed a screw to keep it from ever being assembled.

However, the food gang manage to do it. But to finally finish the Insane-o-Flex, they must venture to the laboratory of Dr. Weird -- and soon the Insane-o-flex has not only turned into a giant techno-playing robot, but has spawned a bunch of tiny Insane-o-flexes. Can the madness be stopped?

""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" works because it is ten minutes long, full of crude humor, and has no continuity, logic, or much of a plot. Well, the movie has the lack of logic and the crude humor, but unfortunately it attempts a a bunch of plots that never quite gel, including an ""origin"" plot that attempts to explain who made the fast-food weirdos and the Mooninites.

And admittedly it works for the first several scenes, which starts off with a crazy little plot that turns out to be a Shake lie, and leads in to the promising ""evil exercise machine"" storyline. It's the sort of mad, plotless thing you'd expect. But when Carl tells the Aqua Teens to go find Dr. Weird, the story starts stretching itself too thin, and twisting into a strained attempt at an actual plot. The story perks up a bit at the climax (a return to the madness), but overall it just doesn't work.

The characters are as you expect them: Frylock is wise and slightly offbeat, Meatwad is childlike and not too bright, and Shake is nuts and narcissistic. And there are some familiar characters who make cameos, including the Mooninites, Dr. Weird, Cybernetic Ghost Of Christmas Past From The Future, Plutonians, and Rush drummer Neil Peart. Oh, never mind.

""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD"" might be amusing if viewers can switch off their brains from one scene to the next. Amusing beginning and end, but a saggy middle.",1179273600,,2743,4.652892561983471
1588055,4,B00005JPP2,"I'm an ATHF fan from the start of the series. When I first left the movie, I was disappointed. I expected a 90 minutes laugh-fest.

After a few days of reflection I realized that this was an important film to the series and was more of a MOVIE than an extended ATHF episode. This film addressed the origins of the characters. Something far too important  for an 11 minute episode.

This movie was not great.  It was however, a very important piece of the ATHF world. My advice: look at this movie as an explanation of the series (i.e. documentary) and enjoy a few laughs along the way.

On a side note, I am considering changing my name to Walter Melon...",1178668800,,655,4.380165289256198
1588056,3,B00005JPP2,"I had a strange feeling of being duped after I watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theatres.  I wasn't exactly disapointed, there were some really hilarious moments, but I felt like I just paid nine dollars to watch a really long episode of the television show.

The Aqua Teen Hunger Force work best when they have a limited ammount of time.  What makes the show so great is that you spend 10 minutes trying to figure out what the hell's going on and before it's start to get annoying it's over.  The movie is exactly the same way, but being that it's 80-90 minutes long, it gets annoying numerous times and has a tendency to drag on.

But it was funny, the death metal concession stand snacks at the beginning were hilarious, the Pultonians, the Mooninities, and the Robot Ghost of Christmas past all had some funny moments.  And Neal Pert in a flying watermelon is genius.  But between funny parts, the movie kind of stagnates.

But still, the Aqua Teens aren't really designed to be on a big screen.  There designed to be watched late at night, when your either drunk, high, or both.  So if you go see it, get heavily intoxicated first, it might help with the boredom.",1176681600,,1187,4.5046728971962615
1588057,3,B00005JPP2,"In the opening of the movie, you are told, very harshly might I add, something to the affect of, ""if you don't understand this, then you don't need to be here"", and I sincerely agree.  Because, while I who enjoy the show give this a three, I would imagine the extra-sensitive, or even passive movie aficionado would probably give this a one-star rating, after walking out shocked in the first five minutes.  I understand that, as this is indeed a shocking movie.  On the flip side, if you do understand this, then the film is probably for you.

Now, normally I delve into plot here, but to do that is near impossible, as well as, almost unnecessary.  What you want is the funny, see..., and let me tell you, this movie definitely has it.  However, it's all pretty much put into the first half of the film.  Trust me it's true, as I saw it twice on opening weekend and the first time, due to exhaustion I fell asleep at the end, but the second time I almost fell asleep due to boredom.  Of course, the biggest question on everyone's lips beforehand regarding this film was whether or not the creators could take a 15-minute show and turn it feature length.  Well, no is the short and simple answer, as this probably should have been a 45 minute film, but I promise the 45 minutes are absolutely hilarious for Aqua Teen fans.  But, then everything slows down, some kind of plot is almost achieved, and the jokes diminish for the most part (except the very end.)

Even so, I do recommend this film to any, passive or obsessive, Aqua Teen fan, and also to the film fan who believes they've seen it all, and wants to see more.  Because while this film didn't meet my utmost hope, the fact that the creators achieved as much zaniness as they did, earning the R rating by far, is still impressive; thus leaving me to believe, that indeed, the film is worth the price.",1176595200,14,1860,4.422287390029325
1588058,2,B00005JPP2,"The Aqua Teen Hunger Force is comprised of living, breathing, and talking fast food items that live in New Jersey. Master Shake (is a milkshake that enjoys slacking off. Frylock (Dave Willis) is a pack of fries who speaks like Shaft, but is the team's voice of reason. Meatwad (Dave Willis) is an infantile, shape-shifting meatball that is always curious. One day, Shake buys an exercising machine called the Insane-O-Flex that, in actuality, is a piece of equipment that could pose a threat to the world. When their neighbor Carl (Dave Willis) tries it out, he finds himself stuck to it, and it morphs into a rampaging robot that buffs him up. With a villainous watermelon (Chris Kattan) and Rush drummer Neil Peart heading to Earth to claim it, as well as the evil Plutonians (Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro), the Force must team up with the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past (Matt Maiellaro), and two bumbling aliens (Mike Schatz and Andy Merrill), to make sure no harm comes to Jersey.

Right off the bat, I am not a huge fan of the Adult Swim animated comedy ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"". But because of its quirky charms and offbeat humor, I tune in to the adult-oriented Cartoon Network show whenever it's on, just to get a good chuckle or too. Hell, I'm even up for the movie adaptation, ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Movie Film For Theatres"" (which sounds like a play on words a la ""Borat""). So how come I didn't care for it that much as I wish I did.

Much like this year's ""Reno 911: Miami"", cast and crew members have all collaborated to bring their vision to the big screen. ""Aqua Team Hunger Force"" directors Matt Maiellaro (voice of Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past, Satan, and Err) and Dave Willis (voice of Carl, Ignignokt, Meatwad) pretty much follow suit like what they did on the TV show: rapid-fire hit-and-miss jokes, off-the-wall absurdity that looks like something from a Sci-Fi Channel program, and spoofs of pop culture. But when TV-show-to-movie adaptations expand upon their one-note blueprint to include more juicy material (South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut had plenty musical numbers to qualify as a bonafide Broadway production with raunchy humor), ATHF sort of place it safe.

Aside from a humorous musical number at the beginning that spoofs assorted foods singing about proper theater ettiquette, then switches to grungy junk food spitting a death metal track, ""ATHF"" is way, way, WAY broad and silly. Too silly for its own good, I may add. Dana Snyder, as the voice of Shake, gets some comedic mileage out of his line readings, reminding me what Vince Vaughn would look like if he was a paper milkshake cup. Sadly, Snyder doesn't get enough time to pepper the material with these goods, since Willis and Maiellaro are focused on throwing silly plot twist upon silly plot twist about the Insane-O-Flex, how our heroes came to be, a buff woman with a deep voice, talented ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members Chris Kattan (as aforementioned watermelon baddie) and Fred Armisen (as President Lincoln) filling the empty 87 minute void and nothing more, the Plutonian baddies not accomplishing when everything they try to do moves at a syrupy-slow pace, aliens Emory and Oglethorpe messing around with the Ghost of Christmas Past... I pretty much covered the whole entire movie.

It's hard not to recommend this movie, especially when there's a scene involving Master Shake belting out an original song called ""Nude Love"" to attempt to calm the Insane-O-Flex down. It's more proof that Snyder can make lemons into lemonade. Sadly, to find something matching this quality, you'll have to sit through all this mindless, pitched-to-the-rafter comedy dead-ends to find it.",1176595200,3,3694,4.915064102564102
1588059,5,B00005JPP2,"This movie is only dumped on by losers who don't like the show.  If you don't like the show, don't go see the movie.  The opening of the movie was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life, even crying the laughter was so hard.  The movie was never slow, the laughs never stopped and the money was so worth it.  If you like the show, see this movie.  If you don't like the show, shut your mouth and go see some Disney movie.",1176508800,12,425,3.9529411764705884
1588060,1,B00005JPP2,"No doubt, some people will tell you they liked this movie. Some will be folks in their forties desperately trying to be hip ... the pseudo-intelligentsia. From them, you'll probably hear things like, ""Ooh. So random. So surreal. You just need to experience it. There's no way I could possibly explain it. It's a commentary on the mindless emptiness of suburbia. Oooooh."" Don't listen to them. From the younger crowd, you might hear, ""Our parents would never understand this. It was SOOOOO funny. So random. It's so cool that fast food can talk! We're all made of meat!"" Don't listen to them either.

I've walked out of films before. They were films I should never have gone to see in the first. Santa Clause 2 springs to mind. None were as bad as this incredibly unfunny -- and  ultimately boring beyond description -- piece of garbage.

Now, I watched the show on television a few years back. I thought it had a silly charm in its off the wall and oftentimes surreal stupidity. However, there's really none of that charm in this waste of film. After a fairly funny start -- a spoof of a theatrical lead in about what you shouldn't be doing in the theater -- it quickly dives to the bottom. Its cultural references are mediocre; its attempts at gross-out humor boring. Sometimes, people who are stoned off their gourds can be funny. Other times, they can only put together things that appear funny to them ... and no one else. This falls squarely into the latter category. (No question the people who made this were on drugs. I would like to know what they are so I could avoid them. Ketamine maybe?)

I like offbeat humor a lot. Humor has no place in a description of this horrendous mess.

I'd see the remake of the Wicker Man again before I'd see this. In fact, I'd have a root canal to avoid watching this movie.",1176422400,12,1816,4.524390243902439
1588061,4,B00005JPP2,"I saw this movie on the day it came out and I've got to say that the reviews I've read from the critics are right.  That is to say that it won't win any new converts but is a gem nonetheless if you're already a fan of the show.  Even if you aren't, the first five minutes with the food items telling the audience rules for the viewing is absolutely one of the funniest things ever for anyone.  It has some food items from the theater telling the audience about how they can go to the lobby for food and making some subtle innuendo at the same time, until they're pushed aside from some harder-edged food items it start wailing on hard-core metal guitars, screaming to shut up, don't talk about the plot, if you've got baby then bring them outside into the street and run them over later when you're done, the movie is copyrighted, etc., etc., etc.  Absolutely hysterical since it has them mentioning every interuption that you could think of.  The movie itself is pretty funny, but some of the jokes fall flat and I could've done without the make-out scenes.  But it's got the best characters from the show, including the main characters, the Mooninites, the Plutonians, the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, MC Pee Pants, and even the return of Dr. Weird and Steve (both of whom haven't been on the show in a while).  Master Shake is as hysterical as ever in his egotistical, vain, and obnoxious self (down right funny when he tries to stretch and farts instead).  Ultimately the story is about a deadly exercise machine that is far too technical than it should be and how it comes alive and goes on a deadly rampage instead.  Not as good as the best episodes from the T.V. show, but still pretty funny.",1176422400,3,1722,4.476038338658147

Ever since I was 5, I would tune in to Adult Swim to watch space ghost, Sealab 2021, The Brak Show, and of course, Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Ever since, I've loved the show since. I am now 17 and I still adore the show. A few years after the film came out, I finally saw it and loved it. But going back and seeing the film again tonight, I'm not a big fan. The film falls apart at a lot of seams. One being the writing. For the show, the odd humor worked for the 12 minute episodes of each season. However, for an hour and 25 minutes, it begins to get quite dreadful and drags horribly. Two being the story. The story is a mix of stupid and smart. Those two combinations don't work well with this. Third being the ridiculously flat jokes. The show had jokes that worked, this film had a few laughs, but overall, the jokes get repetitive. Overall, this film is just ok. Worthy of a watch if you're a fan of the show, but don't have high expectations. What is really sad is they could've done a lot with this film.

For a film that delves deeply into heady topics of the nature of humanity, women's rights, race in a post-modern world, and the existence (or lack thereof) of God(s), ATHFCMFfT manages to stay accessible and down to earth. Thought provoking and insightful to a fault, it never seems preachy or as though the filmmakers had an agenda. Matt Malleiro shows his pedigree by paying homage to the great directors of the past and present with nods to Cronenberg, Svankmeier, Lynch, Kubrick, Sirk, Buuel, Fellini, Scorcese, Jodorowsky, Griffith, Selznick, and even Aronofsky amd Del Toro littered throughout. Truly, I have seen the face of God and he has mad manifest by this chef d'oeuvre, this most glorious of experiences, this crowning achievement that casts to ruin all other paltry attempts at artistry that came before it and those that have yet to pay for their arrogance.",1440460800,,1178,4.9847715736040605

The comedy is crazy, the extended runtime is god-like for any fans that want their thirst quenched with the trio, and it's surprisingly interesting.

They did a great job of keeping the momentum going and the laughs coming through the whole feature.  Just about essential if you are a fan of the show.  If you aren't. .  . well you probably won't like this one.  The film does address the origins of the Aqua Teens, as well as Frylock's relationship with Dr. Weird.

Every ridiculous thing that happens in the show is funny enough, but with only 10 minutes to fill they can throw it away on anything.  The fact that this is entertaining for a full hour and a half is astounding to me, and I'm pretty impressed that they pulled it off.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought with a bigger budget and a longer running time, they could push the series to new heights, but it just seems like an overlong episode with a bad ration of hit or miss jokes.

I guess that's what I like about the tv show - it's hit or miss, but it's only 10 minutes long and then you're on to the next.  The movie just kinda drags for me and I kept thinking that something huge and hilarious is about to happen, but it never really did.

Worth watching, not really worth buying.  If you're not a ""completest"" and just want to pick up some DVDs for casual (ie stoned) viewing, pick up the series first.  I do like the DVD cover though...",1242345600,2,823,4.144654088050315

First things first, the word ""Colon"" here represents the punctuation "":"" rather than where they may have pulled this script out of. The further adventures of Cartoon Network's show of the same name basically is one extremely long episode of the exact same quality and look, even if they added a couple of new techniques here and there (and unsuccessfully I may add). The boys Frylock, Master Shake, Meatwad and Dennis Franz looking neighbor Carl find a mysterious machine, the Insanoflex (think home workout type) and with it may find the true answer to just who created them and where did they come from. Not to be a spoiler, they DO find those questions out, in fact at least four to five different versions of it! But much kudos should be given to it's parody-like ""Let's go out to the movies and grab ourselves a treat"" opening, probably the best part of the film, and no ATHF appearance there to boot! But truth be told, if you don't find the Adult Swim 00's animated humor of surrealism, awkward long pauses, and pop-culture references, plus never have seen the actual long-running show before, this film will NOT make you a fan. Not that it stinks, it just is too strange to be an ATHF start-point. However, another chockful disc with deleted scenes, specials, fake endings, a complete first draft movie (that's really what you saw in the final product minus their mouths moving [?]) and a commentary of people who have no involvement with the film whatsoever (okay one guy, but he adds nothing too). An interesting attempt at trying to make the cult show into a movie, but in the end like fast food, while it might taste great, it just isn't that good for you.

You won't understand this movie and you never will until you've sat down with the first five seasons of the show and watched all the episodes. But for all you fans out there, WATCH WATCH WATCH! It's got Plutonians and Mooninites and the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past and even Willie Nelson makes a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo (yes fans, Willie Nelson. I almost died, too). Best of all, Mastodon gives an...educational...metal intro that will blow you away.

1590080,4,B00005JPP2,"I am an established fan of ATHF. I went into theaters knowing, expecting, and wanting randomness, utter crap of a plot, and crazy going on's that's been the usual business for Frylock, Master Shake, and Meatwad.

Anything other would've been the real madness.

That said - it isn't as funny as it could be. It still is entertaining, and purely awesome in the fact that it's ATHF and a movie (so ha, take that mainstream commercial media), but still, as a movie it could've been better. Somehow, yeah, I did want to actually know the real beginnings of the gang - so I felt it was a big ""let's diss the fans"" with a big pseudo subplot. But that isn't essential or important in the scheme of things.

NOW.. I'd like to talk about the commentary on the DVD set. Somehow, someway Patti Smith of ALL people got to be on it - commenting on the production of the movie. Let me say this: she wasn't at all involved in the production, she wasn't a voice talent, she didn't do any music, and she didn't even know what Aqua Teen Hunger Force was until recently (not to mention that the first time she saw the movie was during the commentary session).

Commentaries are a tricky thing to accomplish right. Certain people tend to talk over one another, sometimes topics are hijacked and diverted away from the movie to some random off-tangent place, or othertimes people get so sucked into the film they helped create they forget to talk or mention important tidbits fans are dying to know about.

Patti Smith dominated the commentary. Not once did I hear ANYTHING relevant concerning the production, or about developing the story, or anything. Not even funny little stories that happened during production. Nothing. She dominated it, and whipped it into submission. Several times the overly polite guys tried to wring it out of control: one example is in the beginning when they tried to attempt introductions which she interrupted loudly with a segueway story that had nothing to do with anything or another example by saying repeatedly over the course of the commentary, ""Oh gee, my son would love this...""

I suppose you could argue they brought her in because she was from South Jersey, or because she added this ""realistic bizarre esthique"".. or it could be because she was screwing one of the guys on staff.

Seriously, keep your poon and keep your biz separated. She turned the viewers at my place so OFF that we complained that her voice was starting to hurt our ears (at least mine).

I'm not saying ""don't buy the DVD."" Buy it! Rent it! Do whatever! Just when you click on the commentary, don't expect anything but losing 2 hours of your life listening to Patti Smith talk about nothing very loudly and hearing the guys titter in the background.",1223596800,2,2743,4.652892561983471

1590082,3,B00005JPP2,"Like one reviewer put it, the movie is great but would be better as a 15 minute episode. The magic that made the series so great just doesn't translate well into a movie. It's difficult to make something so short funny for an hour or two.

In the movie Fry, Master Shake, & Meatwad try to get buff. They have some contraption that's obviously going to backfire horribly (which it does) since that's something that's a regular in the series. After some misadventures, they start the machine up & it turns into a horrible robotic monstrosity with Carl inside of it. That's pretty much the basic plot in a nutshell. Literally, it could have been shorter. Then again, they wouldn't have been able to put in the added backstory about where they came from and who their parents are. It's funny, but honestly the origin story could have been skipped. It was lackluster.

In the end the movie is good for entertainment value (i.e., it won't bore you), but not good as far as overall greatness goes. I wouldn't buy it full price $25-18, but it'd make a decent addition if you can get it at a bargain price. It's not worth that much.",1215388800,2,1123,4.5

At a time when the writers seem to have no ideas, they decide to do a movie and the results show they still have no ideas. The music video at the beginning is the only reason to watch this movie. It's like a few ATHF outtakes patched together, nothing special, it looks as if no real effort was put into it. No plot and what works fine as 10 minute TV episodes blows when stretched out for an 87 minute movie. Save your money, buy the series DVDs, but avoid this turkey.",1206921600,6,578,4.034782608695652

1590192,4,B00005JPP2,"This review is written for those who (obsessively) watch the Adult-Swim, cult-hit, ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force."" (It is staggering to read reviews by people who have no idea it is a long-running show! Staggering ... and insanely funny!)

The stripped-down premise of the film: Frylock is having flashbacks to his creation (think Wolverine in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2-X-Men-United/dp/B000AYELVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2 - X-Men United</a>&nbsp;). He is on a quest to find his ""father."" What follows is an insanely twisted story with (deliberately) excessive star-wipes.

Perhaps the only reason I did not give this film five-bright-stars is because the writers/animators expose what lays beneath Frylock's jewel (on his back). And, it is wildly anticlimactic (to me). I ""get"" the joke ... it is purposely (ridiculously) anticlimactic ... still.  I was ""saddened"" that Frylock's ""best mystery"" was such a rip-off (Haaaaaaa! Hmmm, maybe it really is funny ... whatever).

The animation was awesome. The writing was standard ""Aqua Teen"" fare (meaning ""postmodern silliness"" including pop-culture references to Phil Collins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-oz-Mouse/dp/B001298HKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 oz.

The voice-acting was excellent. The repeated nods to their fans were (as you would imagine) gratifying. It was ""BrAsome!""

Prepare to meet the fourth Aqua Teen. (That is all I'm saying about that!!)

If you are on the fence, let me give you a shove: this film has kittens being decimated in plasma cannons, chocolate milk (again), watermelon spaceships, sex-ed for the confused (we've all been there), The TerraVue 3000, massive global inbreeding, fiber-optic tiger-print pants (need me a pair of those bad boys), and extended door-knob jiggling  (my personal favorite).

There's probably no point in trying to describe ""Aqua Teens Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD"" to anyone who hasn't already seen it or who is unfamiliar with the TV series on which it is based.  Suffice it to say, the story centers on the highly surrealistic adventures of three anthropomorphized animated characters: a milkshake, a meatball and a floating order of fries who try to save the world from an assortment of villains bent on its destruction.  I kid you not.

If creativity alone made for a quality film, ""ATHFCMFFTFD"" would be a masterpiece. (The title alone should secure it a place in movie infamy.  It makes ""Dr. Strangelove""'s full title seem positively curt and restrained in comparison).  As it is, however, the film feels like something somebody came up with while tripping out on some really bad LSD.  And indeed if one were actually ON acid while watching it, the movie might possibly be funny.  Stone-cold sober, however, one can only sit in poker-faced silence marveling at the fact that there must actually be an audience somewhere out there for this thing.  With its bawdy humor, foul-mouthed language and (sometimes admirable) political incorrectness, it clearly isn't intended for young children (parents beware).  In fact, its post-modern detachment and minimalist animation (as well as the title) suggest that its target audience is young adolescents feeling their first stirrings of rebellion and puberty, a time when even the most commonplace, unsophisticated vulgarity can seem forbidden, hilarious and daring.

The movie borrows much of its style from animated hits like ""The Simpsons,"" ""Beavis and Butthead,"" and ""South Park,"" the only difference being that those works are actually funny while this is not.  One word of advice: if you do plan on watching this, make sure to do so with the subtitles turned on.  That is the only way to get all of the dialogue which, thanks to the intense mumbling of the characters, is about 50% incomprehensible otherwise.  On second thought, given the quality of the writing, missing half of what is being said may not be such a bad thing after all.",1196467200,6,2142,4.980337078651686

Many people say that this movie has no plot, and...well...thats not-entirely untrue, theres a plot, but it makes almost no sense. One of the reasons i love this movie is because of its complete randomness. If u can't appreciate  something for its randomness or crude humor this movie isn't for u.

1590292,3,B00005JPP2,"Saw the middle 30 minutes of this fim in the theatres earlier this year.  Laughed a number of times and was overall amused by its silliness.  I had heard of ATHF but had never seen the show on TV.

Months later, I'm at my sister's house recovering from abdominal surgery and she calls me from the video store and asks if I'd like a movie to watch.  Reading to me from the New Release shelves, she arrives at ATHFCMFFTFD quickly and I select that one (and the German film ""The Lives of Others"").

Later that morning I was watching ATHFCMFFTFD and I gotta tell you, a little bit went a long way.  Granted, I was in severe pain when I watched it and being in pain will taint your enjoyment of anything (unless, of course, your enjoyment lies in being in severe pain, and if that is the case you are probably on a less-trafficked website than this one right now).

After about 40 minutes I had to turn it off -- it was just too much for me.  Too much noise, too much frenetic energy.  I didn't have the strength to keep up.  I watched the rest of it two or three days later.  Didn't get around to the bonus features, but based on the video cover box there appeared to be quite a number of them, so props to everyone for the value-added material.  If you're gonna sell a DVD to the public, any time you load it up with bonus stuff you are keeping the bar at the level it should be.

But overall I liked the outlandishness of it.

And other reviewers are right --  the ""Let's All Go to the Snackbar"" parody was great!",1192579200,2,1511,4.179930795847751

Throw in a very weird scientist and some crazy aliens along with the Aqua Teens' curiosity in finding out about their origin and it makes for a great movie.

The plot is exciting, Master Shake has an exercise machine called the Insano-Flex. However, an important part is missing, the motherboard. What the boys don't know is that it is really a doomsday machine. Finally, a plot and a script with originallity!!!!!!

The laughs are fast and and furious and you will have to watch this flick about 3 times to catch all the jokes. You laugh so hard at one joke, that two or three pass you right on by!

With all the familiar characters from the TV show, this movie is a salute to worldwide fans. I thank all those responsible for the making of this magnificent feature.

Of course for me the highlight was the surprise ending. Not only do we learn that Frylock is actually a lesbian, but the gang's mother is a smoking hot, big breasted, and incredibly sexy 9 layer burrito!!!",1190505600,,1078,4.48469387755102
1590389,4,B00005JPP2,"I am an Aqua Teen Hunger Force fan.  I belong to a yahoo group for their fans in fact.  I understood the movie, (So many people who didn't know what they were looking at are the critics of this movie)  I was not happy with the choices they made for plot and they could have made this better.  I think they should have had people who are experts at writing full featured movies handle this film.
  The thing I loved most about ATHF is their side splitting moments.  I found not even one in the movie.  I was so disappointed.  The preposterous, intelligence insulting, plot was dull.  We were supposed to learn their origins.  WHAT?????  Watermelon alien?  Burrito?  Lincoln? Pyramid?  Exercise machine?  No original theme song?  They ruined what is a little show which is a guffaw a noment and made something that even the most hardened fan can not fathom.
  I give it 3 stars  for what it could have been and Oooh Boy it could have shown everyone what we fans know, ATHF is a fresh inovative idea that should have had your sides splitting.  Williams Street is wonderful at making the show, but they really needed full feature experts.  I also think they mistakenly thought most people understood ATHF.  They should have explained the movie like no one ever saw ATHF before.
  I am just afraid that this means curtains for ATHF on cartoon network. What a tragedy!
  Buy the DVD anyway, I saw it on the first day in the theaters, but I must admit, I did find some funny parts the second time around when I watched the video.
  I recommend non fans watch ATHF TV show vidoes first.  You will see why they got the chance to make a movie.",1190332800,3,1633,4.418918918918919
1590390,3,B00005JPP2,"If you're a fan of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (ATHF), you have very low expectations of the show.  ATHF involves three symbols of fast food: the insane Master Shake (Dana Snyder), the lovably moronic Meatwad (Dave Willis), and the super-intelligent Frylock (Carey Means).  They are exactly what they sound like: walking (sometimes floating), talking shakes, piles of meat, and boxes of fries.  This is not an ironic fact lost on the producers; at various times, other people who encounter the Hunger Force (like Carl, the shut-in voiced by Dennis Franz) comment on the strangeness of these bizarre alien beings who happen to act like teenagers.

There are other beings who happen to harass our protagonists, including spiky aliens, aliens that look like they came from an Atari 2600 video game, and aliens that might be time traveling robot turkeys.  But that's largely irrelevant, because ATHF isn't so much a universe as it is performance art, with the topic of the night playing out to its inevitable conclusion.  In the vein of much British humor, plotlines and continuity are irrelevant.  Characters argue with each other, fight with each other, and even kill each other.  Sometimes, Frylock gets tired of his idiot roommates and just leaves.  Sometimes, Master Shake's insanely far-fetched plans destroy the world.  And sometimes, Meatwad kills Master Shake.

ATHF, unburdened by any real anchors to reality, is thus free to explore whatever, whenever, and wherever, the plot meandering to some illogical conclusion, often played for laughs but sometimes just to torture a particular character to death.  15 minutes of this is hilarious, and it's pretty obvious that ATHF is meant to be watched by college kids with short attention spans.  And adults like me who have 15 minutes before going to work.

So why make a movie? Or to be more precise, why make a movie titled Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters?

The dodge is that it reveals the origins of the ATHF, but that's silly.  For one, ATHF's comedic value is precisely in the complete and utter lack of explanation as to why fast food is living in New Jersey.  For another, ATHF is about conflict between various characters for no good reason other than to dance for our entertainment.  And that's precisely what the movie does, although it wears a little thin after the prerequisite 15 minutes normally allocated to the television show.

Explaining the plot of the movie is pointless, because it's not meant to be explained. It involves a talking watermelon, a mad scientist, Bruce Campbell voicing a chicken McNugget (of course), Space Ghost, the reincarnated soul of MC Pee Pants, the CIA, jazzercising giant robots that poop little jazzercising robots, and Abraham Lincoln's time travel shenanigans.  Aren't you sorry you asked?

Your perception of all this is really dependent on your perception of the show.  It won't turn you into a fan.  In fact, the entire intro is a joke on those ""let's go out to the movies"" dancing food characters, with various angry incarnations of movie junk food screaming to thrash metal, ""You came here. Watch it.  Don't like it? Walk out.""

I didn't walk out. If you're a fan of ATHF, you won't either.",1189900800,,3212,4.947761194029851

1590456,3,B00005JPP2,"Those who know me know I love Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Sometimes.  The writers are good at finding things that are funny that other people don't.  Sometimes.  This series has been the source of several ten minute spurts of hilarity that may never be matched in my lifetime.  But just some.  And that's really the problem.  Even for the initiated, indoctrinated Aqua Teen Hunger Force fan, a few of the shows just don't click.  I think that Hand Banana was hilarious and Grim Reaper Gutters was pretty awful and Global Grilling is just ho hum.  That's just this season.

One of the charms of the Adult Swim block on television is that if you don't like what's on, it's entirely possible that ten minutes from now, it won't be any more.  If a joke falls flat for these writers on television, it's a short experience, easily forgotten by the viewer when he tunes in again and gets a hilarious payoff.  In a movie theater, however, that particular privilege of their original format goes away and you're left with a film that's up and down and ultimately doesn't pay out as much as you might expect it to.

Now, don't get me wrong - fans of the show should buy the movie.  The extras are thick and meaty, and the film is at least entertaining enough for a person well indoctrinated in the series that it will be more enjoyable than not.  For a viewer who's never heard of this Aqua Teen Hunger Force thing, however, my sincerest advice is to run as far and as fast as you possibly can, because you will hate this movie.  Not just dislike - hate.

Any time a movie doesn't even try for large segments of the audience (the majority, in this case), you have to rate it accordingly, particularly given the fact that fans of the show are only going to read these reviews to find something they disagree with and argue about it.  So, yeah - average viewers, think of this three as more of a one and a half with a big fat caution.

Seriously, though - there were some pretty excellent gags.  The opening parody reel ought to be shown before every single film released for the next ten years, because it's a neat and effective way of expressing what we're all thinking.  After that, however, you get a sort of bumpy ride of chuckles and boredom.  I didn't personally find large parts of the story to be that satisfying, and the whole thing seemed to me like the writers were straining a little bit.

There is reason for optimism, though.  As a backer of the show, I have felt obliged to purchase this movie, and if only for the extras and the good parts, I think it was worth the money I paid for it.  The film also turned over something like ten times its budget, so we might be able to reasonably expect this sort of treatment for other Adult Swim programming in the future.  And, as I hope I've beaten into the ground by now, the funny bits are reasonably funny.  I just have a hard time with a movie where as many of the gags fall flat as this one.

Bottom Line:  this film is ONLY, and I will stress that ONLY part, for the already-established fan.  If you're a new person looking into just what this Aqua Teen Hunger Force is all about, I'd have to recommend that you get started with the first or second season DVDs (I actually started with the fourth) and see if the show is at all to your liking before you consider picking up this movie.",1188950400,28,3335,4.358184764991896

Coming from a rather oddball family, I have the kind of irreverent sense of humor required to sit through this whole film.  Once you get past the fact that there is no real ""plot"", and just enjoy the gags, it's great.

I can't begin to describe how random and plain weird this movie is many times.  Things just happen or something is said that makes one half of your brain say, ""WTF?"", and sends the other into a laughing fit.  You may want to rent it first, because this is definitely one of those films where you either love it or dismiss it as a waste of time.  However, if you do like to laugh and are the kind of person who finds a chicken standing nonchalantly while on fire and screaming hysterically while two characters engage in casual dialog, hilarious, then you might love this film.

1590460,5,B00005JPP2,"I must admit that I am a longtime fan of the TV show and that I own all four volumes that are on DVD. When I read some reviews saying that this was a let down from the show, I lowered my expectations and got the movie anyway. Turns out, my expectations should have been raised! I found this movie to be absolutely hilarious for what it is, silly, random riffing on pop culture, satire and just bizarre left-field humor. This is the kind of movie where plot is not needed because it interferes with the constant parade of insanity. I must reiterate what many other reviewers have said: if you enjoy the show or have an twisted sense of humor, or are fed up with formulaic, rigid movies, this is worth seeing. If you don't know about the show or expect your movies to have some sort of plot, character development or resolution (or you enjoy cookie cutter comedies) this is probably not worth your time",1188259200,,900,4.395209580838324

1590462,5,B00005JPP2,"Ok, the Aqua Teen show is not rocket science although it is completely hilarious.  Screw the critics and other people posting negative reviews about this film...they obviously have never seen the show, have no sense of humor at all and probably are in bed by 8 each night.  There are so many hysterical moments in this movie i.e. the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past dry humping anything in sight, Ignignokt & Err trying to steal a coffee table in a VERY SLOW moving tractor beam (""Watch now as we commit First Degree Grand Theft Coffee Table!""), Meatwad's Survivor-esque exercise video [something like ""Lose Weight!  Eviscerate!  Island of Death!  Sea of Blood!  Volume 2!""] which has grossly obese contestants being forced to run around an island, all the while being chased by a laser-shooting mutant exercise machine called the Insanoflex.  {I still can hear that damn Insanoflex song in my head... ""I like your booty but I'm not gay!"").  These are just a few of the dozens of hilarious inside-jokes, gags and other rude, crude and largely offensive (yet screamingly funny!) remarks about race, different cultures, etc.  The only thing that disappointed me about this 2-disc DVD was the fact that the so-called 'deleted' movie really is nothing special.  The animation is not finished, the mouths are not animated to fit the dialogue, there are a LOT of storyboards/sketches/rough animation spots, etc.  From what I can figure, all of the regular 'deleted' scenes comprise the 'extra' footage from the 'deleted' film.  So, don't get all excited thinking it's a different bonus movie because it isn't.  All in all, anyone with an elevated sense of humor will get a kick out of this film.  Watch it and make your own decision.",1187827200,2,1730,4.9411764705882355
1590463,3,B00005JPP2,"Extensions of TV series or sequels to movies with a built in fan base often have the lofty task of creating a film that is enjoyable to fans and the uninitiated alike - that is if a huge box office gross is a concern.  As Aqua Teen Hunger Force CMFT speaks only to its fans the latter group is not a concern.  ATHFCMFFT should have a spot in movie history as one of the weirdest things ever captured to celluloid.

The plot (yes there is one) revolves around an exercise machine called the Insane-o-Flex, a standard exercise machine that transforms into a giant havoc wreaking menace that Frylock, Shake, and Meatwad must destroy - and in order to do that - may also find out about their origins.  But if you're a fan of Aqua Teen, you'll know that none of that matters.  What does matter is that the things these writers come up with can only be described as insane and bizarre.

The uninitiated will likely feel that most of this was made up in a day's time.  Flying watermelons, a conviing time traveling Abe Lincoln and Bruce Campbell as a giant chicken nugget.  All this and more are just a few of the strange, sometimes inspired but always bizarre imagery that graces your screen.  And when it comes down to it - that's all an aqua teen fan needs.

Taking a step back, however and looking at this as a film unto itself, I had my reservations.  The strange ensemble of characters seems to only give everyone screen time and the jokes behing all these characters is lost to the layman moviegoer.  If you're not familiar with the characters, you'll probably only be mildly entertained after the hilarious introduction by several movie theatre snacks.

As a fan, I was a little let down too.  While I appreciate the madcap humor the makers of aqua teen have packed into their 12 minute episodes, the attempt to raise the level of bizarre here seems to do it for the sake only of ""how much can we get away with"" rather than artistic worth.  While you can't expect or really desire a proper story from Aqua Teen, some of this seems thrown together.  Throughout the entire film, their history seems unclear, even in the end, which is funny in and of itself, I guess, but I wanted a lot more from this.

Perhaps the DVD is the best way to view this though.  Like the season sets for the show, this is crammed with extras.  There is even a ""deleted movie"" which collects a series of deleted sequences and pieces them together.  The unfinished nature of this makes it difficult to watch, but it will be pleasing to die hard fans.  My favorite extra has to be something that's actually been on the internet for sometime, which is a series of fake endings to the film, that were shown leading up to the film's release.  These are short pieces that are often parodying movies or genres of films.  Short, simple, and fun.  That's what makes the show so special and what might make the movie drag a little.  But don't get me wrong - it's still fun, but only in small doses.  If nothing else, it's one of the most bizarre things you'll ever see as a movie.",1187308800,2,3046,4.423698384201077

1590555,4,B00005JPP2,"Of all of Adult Swim's original programming, Aqua Teen Hunger Force proved to be the most popular, which made a feature film pretty much inevitable.  And we get it with Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, which takes the unbridled, non-sensical insanity of the show and brings it to the big screen in spades.  Even if you've never seen the show before, just reading the title of the movie will give you a clue as to what to expect here.  The central plot (and I use that word loosely) of the movie revolves around the origins of the Aqua Teens: Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad; as they unite to save the world, well, kind of that is.  For those that are familiar with the show, expect plenty of familiar faces, most notably irate neighbor Carl, the Mooninites, Dr. Weird and his assistant Steve, and others as well.  Die hard fans will find little to be disappointed by, however it is worth noting that the humor does wear thin as the film goes along.  That aside though, there's plenty to enjoy here, and there's a nice crew of guest voices including Bruce Campbell, Chris Kattan, Tina Fey, and legendary Rush drummer Neil Peart.  The DVD features are wonderful as well, including the original ""deleted"" Aqua Teen movie, deleted scenes and fake endings, music videos, and more besides.  All in all, Aqua Teen fans new and old will get varying degrees of enjoyment out of the Aqua Teen movie, and the DVD special features make it worth picking up alone.",1187222400,10,1474,4.620689655172414

Anyone associated with the creation and production of this film must sense its own irremediable inferiority. That's why fans are so desperate to promote, foster, and institute it; it's the only way for the fans to distinguish themselves from the herd.

Why do fans consistently refuse to acknowledge that Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD descends from a long line of jackbooted, reprehensible sociopaths who like to subvert time-tested societal norms?

There are appearances by Dr. Weird, Steve, Ignignokt and Err (the Mooninites), Oglethorpe and Emory (the Plutonians), MC Pee Pants, and Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future.

The problem with the movie is not that it's like an 80-90 minute long Aqua Teen episode... it's that it doesn't hold the same already strained logic and coherency of the series. Despite the Aqua Teens being food items and Mooninites invading to bum money and raise havoc, the show had some consistency and even coherency. When Shake bought a grill that turned New Jersey into a pressure cooker, a rip didn't open up and demons from hell start square dancing with Meatwad. That's essentially what the movie does.

The final scene of the movie is an example of this, where random creatures start showing up and the story of Dr Weird creating the Aqua Teens goes nuts with--spoiler alert--stories changing from Dr Weird creating Frylock, to Frylock creating Dr Weird, to a Watermelon slice called Walter Melon creating them all, to a nine-layer bean burrito creating them, along with a VCR built into Frylock's back.

Unlike the TV series, the movie was just a random mass of gay jokes, craziness, and very un-Shake and un-Meatwad-like behaviour in most of the scenes. It's so densely nuts and incoherent that it would make the TV series look like a traditionally structured TV comedy.
