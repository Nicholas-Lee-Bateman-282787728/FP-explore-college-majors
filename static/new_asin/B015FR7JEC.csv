7435550,5,B015FR7JEC,"My three-year-old twins LOVE Paw Patrol so we were pretty excited for this new DVD to arrive today! Ever since I introduced my kids to Paw Patrol, they have become obsessed with it and never seem to get tired of it. We have all of the other Paw Patrol DVDs that are currently available and somehow, they never get tired of watching the same episodes over and over again. Well, this mommy was very happy to find out that there was a new DVD coming out soon so we could introduce some new episodes because while my kids don't get bored with the same ones, I sure do. I have boy/girl twins and this show is one that is great for them to agree on and we rarely have any arguments over what to watch, which is a bonus for me!

Brave Heroes, Big Rescues contains six episodes:

Pups Save Jake
Pups Save the Parade
Pups Save a Mer-Pup
Pups Save a Friend
Pups Save a Stowaway
Pups Bark With Dinosaurs

This DVD is 92 minutes long (Pups Save a Mer-Pup and Pups Bark With Dinosaurs are both double-length episodes) and had my kids entranced from the moment we popped in this disc! For anyone who is a fan of Everest, she appears in one episode (Pups Save a Stowaway). These episodes were a lot of fun for my twins to watch and I know they will be asking for this one for a long time. As a mom, I think Paw Patrol is a great show for young children because it's safe for them to watch and how can anyone not like a show about a bunch of adorable pups?!?!?!? I highly recommend Brave Heroes, Big Rescues to any Paw Patrol fan!",1456790400,58,1514,4.160409556313994

7435694,5,B015FR7JEC,As with the other Paw Patrol dvd I purchased these because my grandkids are such fans of the show on Nickelodeon. The show is based on a young boy and 6 pups that respond when there are emergencies in Adventure Bay. Some of it seems silly as the adults are portrayed as inept but since the kids don't know that it's not an issue. I'd recommend it.,1464912000,4,347,4.1940298507462686
