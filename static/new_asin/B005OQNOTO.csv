4854387,5,B005OQNOTO,"I was never a fan of mad,But after watching it on cartoon network i had to order this series. If you are not up to date with certain music,or movie entertainment you will probably not see this funny or appealing. I take it for what it is and i love it. I wish cartoon network would release more season. I cross my fingers",1356825600,,321,4.111111111111111

4854390,4,B005OQNOTO,"Being a BIG fan of Mad magazine, I gravitate towards anything with Alfred E. Neuman's face on the cover and Mad Season 1 Part 2 is no exception. If you're like me then you will enjoy the magazine's various parodies of movies, televison and popular current news events and personalities. If you enjoy Mad Magazine's various articles by the usual gang of idiots, you will find the live action versions of SPY VS. SPY, Sergio Aragones marginals, Don Martin's cartoons and Mort Drucker's great caricatures of popular movie and television stars as they leap off the screen rather than the page in full colour accompanied by music and dialogue which is perfectly matched to the characters and situations they are depicting.
Treat yourself to both Mad Season 1 parts 1 and 2. You won't be disappointed!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MAD FANS!!",1343347200,3,833,4.873239436619718

There are no extra features on this DVD which is a drawback. The DVD is over two hours long and there was plenty of room for extras. The animation is better in the second volume than in the first volume.",1493683200,,876,4.918918918918919
