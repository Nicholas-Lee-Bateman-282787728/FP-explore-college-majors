8213227,5,B000UGR99Y,"This dvd offers a good sample of 1960's musical performances. The picture and sound are both good and all of the performances are in color.
Fourteen acts are represented, with each act performing just one song-with two exceptions: Janis Joplin performs two numbers, while The Supremes reign supreme here, singing three songs. If you're a lover of 1960's popular music, you'll enjoy this video. The only negatives are the relatively short 65 minute running time ...and the fact that this dvd is apparently now out of print.",1506643200,,522,5.011494252873563

8213229,5,B000UGR99Y,"This 1998 edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated best of Sullivan series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

This edition features two numbers from Elvis Presley's second Sullivan show gig and one from his third. He's shown full-figure in all his controversial hip-swinging glory for the first two. During the January '57 stint, per network censors ""E"" is seen only from the waist-up. Afterwards, Ed publicly called Elvis ""a real decent, fine boy,"" but off-mike he grumbled the expletive ""sumbtch."" Presley couldn't hear what was said and he thanked the mercurial emcee. E's manager, Col. Tom Parker made sure this demeaning telecast was the last Sullivan show appearance for his boy.

During a special r&b-flavored 1955 broadcast, Ed brought in as co-host WWRL deejay Tommy Smalls (aka ""Dr. Jive"") and he intros Bo Diddley, a performance cut short here. Fats Domino's and Jerry Lee Lewis' 2nd half songs are also edited. All others are ""live"" and full length.
