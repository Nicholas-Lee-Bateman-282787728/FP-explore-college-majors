7798031,5,1573306746,"I've been doing this workout since 2000.  I have other DVD's, but don't use any of them, b/c this one can't be beat, i.m.o.  I like do the hour-long workout 2-3 times a week and the yoga + the crunches section of the hour-long workout 3 other days a week.

It is not a dance video in any way, they just play music in the background.  It is extremely easy to follow.  This isn't one of those videos where you will be trying to figure out how to do the different things, they are very simple, yet very effective.

The 30 minute yoga routine is just so great, too.  I love that it is a voice-over, instead of her talking while she's doing the yoga.  That and her soothing tone help to make it very peaceful.  She holds the poses for the perfect amount of time, i.m.o., longer than other yoga videos I've done.

You'll need steps, light hand weights & a yoga mat.  That's what they use in the video anyway, and that's what I use.  The folks in the video are using heavier weights than me, even after all these years of doing this video, but this video does keep me in great shape.

Keith is very motivating and stresses safety and good form.  Courtney (yoga instructor) is very soothing, which helps you get a good little yoga workout, in a peaceful way.",1369526400,,1250,4.263829787234043
7798032,5,1573306746,"This workout will work ALL of your muscles & it is so much fun!! Keith (the instructor) is very motivating & he takes you through a challenging workout in which you will need a pair of hand weights, a step (optional)& keep some water nearby because you will need to keep hydrated.  I don't own a step & the moves are very simple to follow (trust me your legs will be sore the next day!!!!) He has 2 girls working out with him, one does the beginner version & the other the advanced exercises. A great thing about this video is that several times they have you check your heart rate against a chart on the screen to make sure you're on track. When choosing your hand weights don't use a pair that is too heavy because he will alternate between weights and doing push ups in between, so your arms will get quite a workout!! After doing this workout a few days a week you will notice a difference in your body, but remember that a healthy way of eating plays a big role too! Keith ends with a relaxing cool down and there is a yoga segment following the workout led by another instructor but I have other yoga videos that I prefer to do.",1067385600,,1134,4.225806451612903
7798033,3,1573306746,"Keith Byard, might not be the best workout video instructor in terms of cuing (sometimes the count is to 16, then to 24, 15, 30, 25!), but he is so earnest and well-meaning that you forgive him this.  He will also give you  an enjoyable total body strengthening and sculpting workout.  The brief  cardio section, using every-day movements instead of ""Solid Gold""  Dancer moves, was mostly easy to follow ( Keith, you gotta cue!) Ah! Too  bad it was over so quickly. I found the music was average, not great, not  terrible.  The girls were a smidge robotic and charmless, especially the  premature one who kept on getting ahead of the instructor. Keith's section  was nicely shot on the beautiful cliffs of Palos Verdes.  The Yoga section  with Courtney also had some astonishing photography of Utah canyons.  I  would recommend using this tape as sculpting to supplement a great cardio  workout like Karen Voight's ""Energy Sprint"" or Kathy Smith's  ""Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning.""",957830400,26,985,4.914634146341464
