3170787,5,B0017ANB08,I went and saw this movie today and cried as I cried watching the Notebook.  Richard Gere and Diane Lane had that special chemistry once again.  If you loved the Notebook then you will love this movie as well.  Now I am just waiting for it to come out on DVD.,1223510400,13,259,4.03921568627451
3170788,3,B0017ANB08,"If you can imagine every melodramatic romance clich ever conceived of, you'd have a pretty good idea of what ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is like. This movie is sentimental to the point of losing all credibility, which makes me wonder why Nicholas Sparks, the author of the original novel, didn't explore the idea as a parody. I say this because, with so much drama crammed into just ninety-seven minutes, many will find it impossible to take seriously. Some might even laugh incredulously. The sad thing is that it's no better than it wanted to be. Watching it, you'll find that it has no ambition other than to be a syrupy, predictable love story. Sadder still is the fact that Diane Lane and Richard Gere--both wonderful actors--give believable performances. With such varied bodies of work showcasing their talents, you'd think they would have chosen a film much more credible than this.

The plot, in all its overwrought splendor, is as follows. Adrienne Willis (Lane) has recently separated from her husband, Jack (Christopher Meloni), after he had an affair. He wants her to take him back because he knows he made a mistake. She isn't ready to make that decision, which puts her at odds with her moody teenage daughter, Amanda (Mae Whitman). As for her young son, Danny (Charlie Tahan), he has been retreating into a world of video games. When the kids go to spend the weekend with their father in Orlando, Adrienne takes a ferry to Rodanthe, North Carolina, where she will temporally run a seaside inn owned by her vacationing best friend, Jean (Viola Davis). As it turns out, Adrienne will only have to accommodate one guest, partly because it's the off-season and partly because the weather is getting stormy, almost hurricane-like.

Her guest is the recently divorced Dr. Paul Flanner (Gere), who, not surprisingly, is dealing with his own emotional turmoil. Most of it stems from his estranged son, Mark (an uncredited James Franco), who stopped talking to him after joining a medical relief effort in the remote mountains of Central America. Paul's plan is to find Mark and reconcile with him. But before he can do that, he has some business to take care of in Rodanthe; a woman named Jill Torrelson accidentally died while in his care, and now he has to face the widowed husband, Robert (Scott Glenn), and the angry son, Charlie (Pablo Schreiber), both of whom have started a Wrongful Death lawsuit. Paul reasons that he did everything he could, but the fact that he's trying to defend himself when he should be apologizing is only making things worse.

Anyway, we now have Adrienne and Paul, both heartbroken people, alone together in a ramshackle inn. And wouldn't you know it, they engage in long-winded conversations about their troubles. Then they longingly glance at each other as they share glasses of wine with dinner. Then they get into a big argument just as the hurricane approaches the North Carolina shore. As they frantically try to bolt every window shut, they realize that they're falling in love. And after celebrating the storm's end with the local folk, they're finally ready to express their love. I distinctly remember the morning after they've made love; as they lie in bed, Paul describes Adrienne's body using geographical terms. Her arm is a steep mountain. The small of her back is a deep valley. Some may see this as romantic. I see this as the cinematic equivalent to art for art's sake--it's needlessly figurative language in an overly poignant love story. Besides, how could even have a bed to make love on? Wouldn't an inn build directly on the beach be destroyed by a hurricane?

I know this movie will find an audience. The proof is in the vast number of drugstore romance novels published year after year; the people who read them are the same people who will see ""Nights in Rodanthe"" and actually be moved by it. In all likelihood, they had already read Sparks' novel and were moved before entering the theater. I might have been moved had I not seen a major event coming from a mile away. I obviously can't reveal what that event is, but I can say that it makes perfect sense given the story's reliance on melodrama. The audience is expected to cry at a certain point, and indeed, when that point was reached, I could hear sniffling all around me. Does this seem manipulative to you? It sure does to me, especially since it goes hand in hand with obligatory reconciliation scenes that are anything but plausible. No, I can't say who reconciles with whom, but it doesn't matter anyway because it's bad enough that those scenes were included in the first place.

In spite of the over-the-top romance clichs, I'm forced to praise Lane and Gere for their performances. Not only was the chemistry between them great, it seemed as if they actually believed in what they were doing as actors. Too bad they didn't put their talent to better use. Too bad they weren't cast in a film that told a realistic story. Too bad they were stuck in a love story that collapses under the weight of its sentimentality. Too bad this movie had no desire to go beyond its formulaic origins and give us something new. If this kind of filmmaking appeals to you, if you don't have a problem with weepy romances about lost souls rekindling dying embers, then by all means, go see ""Nights in Rodanthe."" It may be the most rewarding movie going experience you'll have this year.",1222819200,6,5390,4.760427807486631
3170789,5,B0017ANB08,"I went and saw this movie yesterday and i was blowen away. Richard Gere and Diane Lane have done another great movie together. Richard plays Paul Flanner who is a doctor and he comes to Rodanthe, NC to see some one. Diane plays Adrienne Willis a wife and a mother of two and is having a hard time in her life. Adrienne goes to Rodanthe to look after her best friend's Bed and Breakfast where she meets Paul Flanner and falls in love.. this movie plays on all emotions. bring tissue Ladies.",1222560000,6,489,4.326086956521739
3170790,2,B0017ANB08,"The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane periodically appears credible in the new film Nights in Rodanthe, adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. Borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's Best Picture winner Out of Africa, Nights in Rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates.

Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. In his guilt, he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in Rodanthe, North Carolina to meet with the husband (Scott Glenn), who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. The trip is on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which is to retrieve his son (James Franco) from Equador, where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.

Meanwhile, Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) is struggling with her two young children, who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. Adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband Jack (Christopher Meloni) who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. When Jack takes the kids for a spell, Adrienne travels to Rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that Dr. Flanner has booked - leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.

The love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. The unmindful, unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane - what a perfect setting for romance. Even looking past the uninspired genesis, Nights in Rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. The audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair, and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth.

It's like a sillier version of Out of Africa, but with more crying, less sweeping romance, and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. Not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score, the story has been done repeatedly (especially from Nicholas Sparks); as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile movie-going experience.

Yet it felt as if the roles played by two very well respected actors didn't give their hearts to this performance which lead to the characters being less believable and found scenes where the recording of this movie as they followed the actors was very choppy.

Enough gritty love & divorce elements to give appreciation to an emerging friendship.  Gere is a physician who is initially estranged from his son, but later work together in humanitarian medical services.  Diane Lane is a temporary host for a Bed & Breakfast Inn along beautiful ocean coast.  One of the best parts is their exchange of USPS mail because there is no cell or internet service in Gere's humanitarian work apart from Diane Lane.  Their exchange of USPS ""hand written""

3170822,5,B0017ANB08,"Based on this Nicholas Sparks novel, in this film, the characters of Diane Lane (Adrienne) and Richard Gere (Dr. Paul Flanner) have a unique chemistry for a romantic partnership that is sizzling again and so believable. As now single with two children, Adrienne is holding down the fort for her friend on the shore of North Carolina, she has one visitor at the Inn she is looking after, this is Paul. He is there to take care of issues of an importance of his own concerning a dire surgical procedure that he cannot rid himself of the guilt over. He has broken down his strategy over and over in his mind and desires greatly to meet the husband of the woman who did not survive the surgery. As a tremendous storm is bracing down on the Inn and these two have got to survive this plus so many personal emotions twisting around them in their private lives. He tells Adrienne that ""life is all about choices"" and in how this movie plays out, this is the truest statement said. A lovely but affecting romance for grown ups and younger people alike. I wish the movie production studios would take notice that there is a great audience for relationships between people over thirty-five, forty, plus... Romantic attachments are not formed specifically during youth but from shared situations, circumstances, and camaraderie, how would these things vanish solely after being young? ... They wouldn't.",1499990400,2,1392,4.780082987551867

3170865,5,B0017ANB08,"The Author of The NOTEBOOK comes another romantic film.
Again meeting with both actor RICHARD GERE and DIAN LANE.
You think they are too old to make it happen? You got it all wrong.
It earned Worldwide $84,375,061. They are still sellable.
Dian Lane is still so very charming and Richard Gere is still very handsome to make it all happen back in 2009.
Warner brothers still thought that they can make a steady romantic film out of this two actors and they did made it happened.
Some complained about these three things.
1. The daughter of Dian Lane suddenly became a good daughter when Richard dies. Yes she was a bad daughter and was a rebel. But when Dian was truly suffered by the loss of her one and only love after her divorce to the father of the daughter, the daughter felt that pain. Again this is a movie not a documentary.
2. At the end why should Richard Gere have to die to make the audience tear jerk? Can it be just a happy ending? Again this movie is based on the best selling novel.
3. The built up relationship of Richard and Dian was too fast and we don't buy that at all. No I don't think so.

Richard had a bad moment in his life by having the surgery and killed an old lady by accident.
He blamed himself all the way, blamed his skills and even came to the patient's house to say it was not his fault.
It was one in a million chance of death.
He just didn't wanted to accept that it was all his fault. He still wanted to think that he is a good doctor.
Indeed he is.
And there he meets the very, very charming hilarious woman who worked for her friend who owns the hotel near the sea who is also in trouble with her marriage.
She is dancing around while cooking, loves music that he also loves, cooks for him the most delicious foods, throws things to the garbage can like doing basketball game, shows him the most beautiful arts upstairs and then there is this deadly storm came and they were about to die and miraculously they were survived.

How can they not fall in love?

The house by the sea is so very beautiful and especially the blue room is miraculous to look at.
The seaside walk by two actors are just pure picture perfect.
The chemistry of two actors are like an old couple. Why not they are already acted many times.
UNFAITHFUL, THE COTTON CLUB and finally this movie when they are really truly gloom.
Dinah Washingtons song is supporting the scene as well. You will like the mood of it when there is moonlight, candle and wine.
One thing is missing, that is love. Eventually will come along.
This movie is for grownups.
But you will love it anyway whoever you are.
You are in the people of good hands. Someone totally believable. Trustable.",1476576000,3,2676,4.31610337972167

3170977,5,B0017ANB08,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Mrs. Willis is headed for a divorce because Mr. Willis took off on her and decided that he wanted to end the marriage.  Just before Mrs. Willis heads to Rodanthe to assist a friend by looking after her hotel due to an upcoming storm Mr. Willis has figured out that leaving his wife was a huge mistake and wants to come back home.

Dr. Flanner is visiting Rodanthe on business as he has his own demons to battle in an upcoming malpractice suit.  He ends up being the sole customer in the hotel that Mrs. Willis is watching over creating what I would call a perfect storm.  Emotions run high as passions run hot in what proves to be one electrifying  romance that would change the lives of all involved.

Mrs. Willis decides against getting back with her husband in favor of Dr. Flanner.  Sadly they must depart ways in favor of a long distance relationship as Dr. Flanner goes to assist his son in a remote country.  During their time apart they wrote letters that ultimately fanned the flames of love as they got to know each other on a much deeper level.  When alas Dr. Flanner is due to come back home to Ms. Willis the cruel hands of fate would step in and Dr. Flanner would never make it back home and into her arms.

Instead Ms. Willis was left with one single box that contained within it's walls all that was left of Dr. Flanner's material possessions the tangible proof of their love for one another.  In a way it was sad to think about because their love was so much greater and Dr Flanner's personality was so much bolder then the physical objects that would be left behind.  Yet the letters and some other odd momentos would end up being the summary of what was left of a love that would no longer be but for the mind to remember.

In the end Dr. Flanner sends Ms. Willis a sign from above that he is still with and watching over her from above.  For me the take away was ""it was better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all."" - Alfred Lord Tennyson",1442707200,,2016,4.282321899736147

In the book Diane Lanes character is telling her daughter the story of how she met Richard Gere's character and how they fell in love. If I were you I would read the book first because the book was AMAZING way better than the movie.

3171017,3,B0017ANB08,"Can one weekend change a life?  Can Blu-ray high definition save a movie?  Yes and no.  Yes to the first question, no to the second.

Diane Lane and Richard Gere worked so well together in 2002's ""Unfaithful"" that Warner Bros. decided to pair them up in 2008's ""Nights in Rodanthe.""  The actors once again work well together, but they should have quit when they were ahead.  This time out they haven't got the script to go with their talents.

Director George C. Wolfe made his big-screen directorial debut with ""Nights in Rodanthe"" after success as a Broadway producer-director and doing several television productions.  Screenwriters Ann Peacock and John Romano based their screenplay for the movie on a novel by best-selling author Nicholas Sparks, who previously provided Hollywood with ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""A Walk to Remember,"" and ""The Notebook.""  One has to wonder if anyone besides Sparks is still writing romance novels or if Hollywood is looking to any other author for romantic material.

Lane plays a divorced woman, Adrienne Willis, with a teenaged daughter and a ten-year-old son.  Her ex-husband, Jack (Christopher Meloni), wants to get back together with her, but Adrienne cannot forgive his infidelity.  She has devoted her life to her husband and children and now feels betrayed by his unfaithfulness.  To compound matters, her daughter hates her for not allowing the father to return to the fold, and the son finds himself bewildered by it all.

Gere plays Dr. Paul Flanner, a divorced surgeon who has even more problems than Adrienne.  He always put his career ahead of his family, one of his female patients accidentally died in a surgery he was performing on her, he's being sued by the woman's husband (Scott Glenn), his wife has left him, and his grown son (James Franco), also a doctor, hates him.  Whew!

Coincidentally, both Adrienne and Paul wind up in the same isolated inn together in Rodanthe, a small town on the North Carolina coast.  She is taking care of the inn for a friend (Viola Davis), and at the moment Paul is the only guest.

Misery loves comfort, I suppose, because Adrienne and Paul quickly find they have a lot in common in terms of personal issues and just as quickly fall into one another's arms.

Frankly, that's about it, except for the ending, which I'll get to in a moment.  The story moves along like a two-person filmed stage play.  Lane and Gere are in practically every scene together after the initial exposition, and there is only so much a viewer can stand of their empty talk.  This is Nicholas Sparks, after all, not Eugene O'Neill, and it's ""Nights in Rodanthe,"" not ""Long Day's Journey into Night.""  So we can see what's coming at least two hankies ahead of time.

Yes, it's good to see a straight romantic movie that involves mature people for a change instead of endless, witless romantic comedies about twenty-year-olds.  But a good romance has to have substance, too, or there's not a lot of reason for it beyond fulfilling some basic need for potboilers.  Here, we get a man who loves Dinah Washington songs, a woman with an old phonograph and even older LPs, and a fairy-tale inn that looks like something out of ""Lemony Snicket.""  It's that kind of movie.

To punctuate the couple's dilemmas, the author throws in a hurricane, which seems severe enough to have blown the whole house down but doesn't.  From there, the story gets increasingly passionate, melodramatic, and, finally, maudlin.

The ""finally"" is the ending, which makes you go ""Ah, come on!""  It is as unlikely an event as you'll ever come across, and the author clearly intended it only as a manipulative plot device.  If the rest of the film simply bores you, the ending will infuriate you.  Come on, Sparks; you're better than that.

Up until its conclusion, ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is a reasonably romantic story that just happens to make for a mediocre film.  It resembles more and more a soap opera as it goes along and then does something unforgivable at the close.

Loved ""The Notebook""; could have done without ""Nights.""

Video:
The movie is fairly short at only ninety-seven minutes, so Warners went with a single-layer BD25 to accommodate it.  Then they used a VC-1 encode to transfer the 2.40:1-ratio widescreen picture to disc at 1080p.  As there is nothing about the image or the colors that jumps off the screen, it's sometimes hard to tell if the movie is in high definition or not without a direct comparison to the standard-def version.  If you do make the comparison, you'll find the Blu-ray sharper and the hues marginally deeper, but it's close because the filmmakers chose to keep the image somewhat soft and pale most of the time.  A few bright outdoor shots show us how good the high-def picture can be, though, and that's still pretty good.

Audio:
For whatever reason, WB reverted to their old ways of going on the cheap with the audio, giving us only a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on this Blu-ray disc.  Granted, the soundtrack is about 99% talk, which doesn't really cry out for lossless audio, but, still, I've always thought ""high-definition"" referred to high-def picture AND sound.  Oh, well.  There is a storm about halfway through the movie where rain, wind, and thunder roar all around us, the deep bass rumbles authoritatively, and a few dynamic jolts practically knock the walls of one's listening room down.  It's plenty good in Dolby Digital, but it leaves one wondering how much better it might have sounded in something like Dolby TrueHD.

Extras:
The extras are exclusive to the Blu-ray disc, and mostly they comprise a series of brief featurettes, all of them in high def.  The first and longest is ""The Nature of Love,"" twenty-one minutes on the author, the filmmakers, and the stars.  Next is ""An Intimate Look at In Rodanthe with Singer/Songwriter Emmylou Harris,"" twelve minutes with Ms. Harris, who explains this was the first time she had written a song directly for a movie.  After that, we get five alternative scenes with a director commentary, totaling about seven minutes; followed by ""A Time for Love:  Keeping Up With Nicholas Sparks,"" eleven minutes with the author of fourteen best-selling novels; and a music video, ""Love Remains the Same,"" with Gavin Rossdale.

Things conclude with some further exclusive features via BD-Live; twenty-five scene selections but no bookmarks; a slipcover for the Blu-ray case; a bonus digital copy disc of the film, compatible with iTunes and Windows Media; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
We've all come to expect a considerable amount of sentimentality in a love story; it comes with the territory.  It's just that ""Nights in Rodanthe"" lays it on so thick, you'd think the author had written it for folks who had never read or seen another romance before.  If you like the actors, you'll probably like the movie for Lane and Gere alone.  It's a shame they didn't have more to work with.

The movie's okay.",1429315200,,316,4.080645161290323
3171033,5,B0017ANB08,"There are people who might dismiss this movie as ""just another small, mediocre romantic drama from Hollywood.""

They would be wrong, because Nights in Rodanthe is an amazing movie. Sure, it is a bittersweet tale about fate who joins two strangers together, and a tragic turn of events that destroys that bond. But there is so much tenderness and beauty in this film, I find it mind-blowing.

There are little moments (which are actually huge), like Adrienne's reply to Paul who is soaked in negativity after a troublesome encounter (chapter 8 in the DVD), which is a little miracle, because we watch in wonder how that humble, loving response disarms and dissolves Paul's negativity, and invites love into their lives. This is my favorite scene in this movie, but there are many other great moments as well.

The acting of the entire cast is great, and the soundtrack is very effective and touching.

In spite of the fact that there is a sad ending to this love story, the movie ends with a hopeful note, that sometimes we have to rise from the ashes of the disasters that storm into our lives and nearly destroy us, and continue our journey in life towards a better future.

So, please don't let the cynics fool you, this is a great film, and the credit goes to Nicholas Sparks, director George C. Wolfe, and everyone who was involved in this great production.",1428969600,,1361,4.677824267782427
3171034,3,B0017ANB08,"I wish I could say to Nicholas Sparks, ""You should be ashamed of yourself, making me bawl like that!"" Talk about yanking at the heart strings, with this story he tears the heart right out of the chest and stomps on it on the ground. To be fair to the author, I haven't read the book, but I imagine it is just as heart-wrenching as this love story that blindsides you... I just didn't see it coming, what happened, but won't say more in case you do not know the story yet. I thought I was signed up for a nice, light-hearted romantic comedy. Then again, this is a Nicholas Sparks story, so that was not the smartest assumption on my part. I do love most of Nicholas Sparks' works. Although this was well acted, I regretted watching it, feeling emotional and weepy the rest of the weekend. Real life is painful enough.

Although I must add that I recently came back from a trip to the Outer Banks and Rodanthe looks much different in person. I would guess that many of the scenes were filmed in the nearby Pea Island wildlife refuge.

It was riddled by lots of contrivances and implausibilities that one logical viewer may find it purely cinematic and made to appease one's romantic feelings and sentimentality. Also,it was worth noting that it was also an unabashedly melodramatic and a tearjerker that will appeal to teen-agers who are falling in love for the first time and young adults who are experiencing romance for the first time. Even Richard Gere and Diane Lane could not save it from what it appears to be into one good movie.",1406764800,,737,4.811023622047244

We talked after the movie and I shared that my fianc was killed and whenever I see movies where lovers are torn apart by death, well, I cry. She shared that her fianc was killed 13 years ago and she also cries still. Amazing acting, amazing love. Sad ending.",1388793600,,347,4.4375

3171202,4,B0017ANB08,"Another great pairing of the amazing Diane Lane with Richard Gere. Playing a married or divorced young/mature woman tempted into a high temperature relationship seems to be her crowning specialty. There really is no one better to portray subtle, fleeting emotions with face and body language. Gere is a perfect foil here, as a respectable physician on a mission to assuage guilt over the death of his patient while under surgery. The progression of their initial impersonal relationship to love is well orchestrated.",1388534400,,516,5.228915662650603

3171213,5,B0017ANB08,"Richard Gere and Diane Lane have found each other on the screen for the second time. In their first, ""Unfaithful"", their acting abilities are evident as they find themselves in uncharted waters as a married couple. In ""Nights in Rodanthe"" they find each other as divorced or separated from their former partners and explore each other's lives, mistakes and opportunities. They each have as actors numerous chances to show their emotions. They both rise to the challenges. I hope they find another vehicle in which to act together again.",1385251200,,536,5.033707865168539

Of course I have to give a little credit to Nicholas Sparks who wrote the book--a master at romance. It's not gushy, mushy or cutesy. It's just a wonderful story of two people coming together and then tragically torn apart. Get out your hankies!",1377043200,,339,4.396825396825397

3171261,3,B0017ANB08,"How odd that james franco is not mentioned in the film's credits or advertising--he was an established movie actor by 2008. This movie has high production values-beautifully shot in lovely locations---for me the story was too contrived -like the beach house-('unfaithful'-with gere and lane is better) but it is worth seeing especially as it is a mature love story. Ageism is alive and well in 2013 with some reviewers critical of anyone over 40 making love. Diane lane's acting is moving. Gere's has always puzzled me----when he is required to emote-his face goes blank for 10 seconds and he stares into space before reacting--it happens in all his movies. Finally-it makes me smile when reviewers say 'it wasn't like the book'----they bring their own pre-conceived images from the book to the film and of course they won't match,also a book ,filmed literally page for page, would last 10 hours. It is wise not to read any book before seeing the movie---",1369958400,,955,4.937888198757764

Lite fare, chic flick.
I liked so many parts of this movie:  good actors, fairly well developed characters, the beauty of the Carolina beaches in widescreen.  There are some good messages:  for mothers and daughters, risk taking, returning to your passions, and continuing to develop and learn about life and to grow no matter our age and stage in life.  My favorite movies have plot twists surprises (there are not many good surprises in movies these days), I really appreciate that this movie has a couple of gritty plot twists that caught me off guard.

I do wish this writer were not so casual about physical relationships outside of marriage, but I know that in today's world I am in the minority; having said that I do not find it overly gratuitous in the movie, and it does fit the storyline.

And did I mention the breathtaking beauty of the Carolina beaches. If you also are a beach lover you MUST see this movie in the widescreen edition.",1347062400,,1141,5.418079096045198

It was the candlelight dinner that made me nauseous----what a terrible script!!  One trite cliche after another.  I wonder how these actors got through it?  Maybe they were so glad to have starring roles at their age?  Too bad.  They are both attractive aging people and it would have been nice to see them in a script that honored that place in their lives.  This was an embarrassment!

That said, what happened later in the plot was a downer. If you haven't seen it, but want to, go ahead. Overall, it's not a bad story, but be prepared for a tearjerker ending, similar to Kevin Costner's movie, Message in a Bottle.",1329523200,,539,4.39

I did check out some reviews before starting to watch it so I could get an idea of what I was getting myself into. I was definitely unimpressed with most of the movie. Diane Lane and Richard Gere's relationship in the movie just seemed too forced and not real in any sense. They just didn't seem to have any chemistry. Usually, I'm able to at least believe that characters such as these would want to be together. It just wasn't happening for me, though. I haven't seen either of them in too many other movies, so I can't comment on their acting abilities in general justifiably. This is one of those movies that I wouldn't really recommend to others to see. To be completely honest, I thought that Mae Whitman's performance was one of the better ones in this movie. I have seen a few movies that were worse than this one. If I thought it was 100% bad, then I would've given it 1 star. There were a few redeeming qualities in it, though, so I went with 3 stars.

3171357,4,B0017ANB08,"People are slamming this romantic drama for being too predictable and sappy. Well, they are right in one sense, but wrong in another. Yes, the film is predictable, but it isn't about the predictability but how characters deal with certain unpredictable things in life. Sappy? Yes, but, again, this deals with certain feelings, provoked and unprovoked, that lay dormant in all of us.

There was some unnecessary melodramatic acting about midway through that kind of put me off (hence the 4 stars), but the rest was good. I can see where people were put off by this melodrama, because I was a bit turned off by the over-dramatic acting about midway through, but I feel the story had a lot of depth.

There are a range of emotions in this film, from love to bitterness, from anger to forgiveness. There are things in life that will always take us by surprise, and none more so than falling in love with someone then they die before you really have the chance to get to know them. I know from my own experience in life. This film hit close to home with me. Yes, I have had something very similar to this happen to me, so it was something I could relate to on a personal level. I met someone one night at a party after work, and it was mutual that we liked each other, and planned on doing something the next evening. He died in a car wreck on the way home, and I was the last person to see him alive. Something I never got closure on...

I, too, saw the outcome of this coming; but I didn't see the way a certain character was gonna deal with the end result. Fabulous performances all across the board: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Scott Glenn, and Pablo Schreiber all give top-notch performances in this, some roles larger than others; but all important to the overall story.

I wanted to see this when it came out because of Gere and Lane, but normally I don't fall for that 'hey they were in that and now they're in this' fad; but those two, well, that`s an exception to the rule that I`ll break gladly. Anyways, I was really impressed with this. Even if the story didn't hit close to home with everybody, I still feel it was a really good film.

Critics ravaged this upon release, but luckily I ignored them; and I am so glad I did!
Awesome direction, acting, and some breath taking scenery make this a very pleasant viewing experience. This is on the same par as the two previous films Gere and Lane did together, Francis Coppolla'a ""The Cotton Club"" (1984) and Adrian Lynne's ""Unfaithful"" (2002).

Basic plot: A divorced woman (Lane) meets a single doctor (Gere) while he is on vacation to deal with a grieving father (Glenn) and son (Schreiber). The two fall in love and the rest is, well, for you to see and find out for yourself. Highly recommended!

But you still feel good about the ending, because the two people did fall in love. Director Nick Cassavetes did a great job of turning this book into a good movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't have the usual hang-up of ""the book was so much better than the movie."" I just know that I like Richard Gere and I love Diane Lane. The chemistry between them is perfect in this movie. The setting is gorgeous. Gere has a kickass car. And the photography is stunning! The bedroom scene between Gere and Lane is incredibly shot. The blue and white colors and the lighting are fantastic! This movie surprised me because I didn't expect to like it.

The two worthy leads not seeming to try very hard, with Gere perhaps faring better than Lane... whose part seems to be not as well-written as that of the male-lead. It's too bad that one of the few recent cinematic attempts to explore mature adult-relationships, among still very attractive protagonists, lapses into the banal and predictable, with a cheap and too-easy emotional trick at the conclusion. Of note, however, is the fine and understated... though powerful performance of supporting player, Scott Glenn... a wonderful example of: acting without seeming to act... and still conveying volumes. Mr. Gere and Ms. Lane should have paid closer attention!

I'm glad that I didn't see this in the theatre, and waited... instead, until its release on DVD, as its worth would not have been equal to the price of admission.

3171384,4,B0017ANB08,"People are slamming this romantic drama for being too predictable and sappy. Well, they are right in one sense, but wrong in another. Yes, the film is predictable, but it isn't about the predictability but how characters deal with certain unpredictable things in life. Sappy? Yes, but, again, this deals with certain feelings, provoked and unprovoked, that lay dormant in all of us. There are a range of emotions in this film, from love to bitterness, from anger to forgiveness. There are things in life that will always take us by surprise, and none more so than falling in love with someone then they die before you really have the chance to get to know them. I know from my own experience in life...Yes, I have had something very similar to this happen to me.
I, too, saw the outcome of this coming; but I didn't see the way a certain character was gonna deal with the end result. Fabulous performances all across the board: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Scott Glenn, and Pablo Schreiber all give top-notch performances in this, some roles larger than others; but all important to the overall story.
Critics ravaged this upon release, but luckily I ignored them; and I am so glad I did!
Awesome direction, acting, and some breath taking scenery make this a very pleasant viewing experience. This is on the same par as the two previous films Gere and Lane did together, Francis Coppolla'a ""The Cotton Club"" (1984) and Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" (2002).
Basic plot: A divorced woman (Lane) meets a single doctor (Gere) while he is on vacaton to deal with a greiving father (Glenn) and son (Schreiber). The two fall in love and the rest is, well, for you to see and find out for yourself. Highly recommended!

3171391,3,B0017ANB08,"One should know walking into a movie adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks book that they are going to have their emotions manipulated; that is just how he works.  I have not read a single novel from the man, although my wife has read them all (and I mean THEM ALL), but I have seen a number of his movies, and they all are pretty much the same.  I generally like them (I thought that `A Walk to Remember' was wonderful, `The Notebook' was impressive and `Message in a Bottle' was memorable) and, while I do like `Nights in Rodanthe' it is by far the least successful of the four.

The film, sadly, doesn't know how to make its overwrought clich seem somewhat inviting.  Instead, it winds up feeling like a middle-aged revival of an overly dramatic teen film.  It doesn't really make the distinction it needs to in order to create a real feeling of adult love.

The film tells the story of Adrienne Willis, an older mother of two whose husband left her seven months ago for another woman and is now on his knees begging for another chance.  While he is away with the kids (manipulating them into taking his side), Adrienne is helping out a friend who owns a sea-side bed and breakfast.  Her friend, Jean, is going to be out of town and was going to shut the place down, but Dr. Paul Flanner offered to pay double if he could stay there, so Jean asks Adrienne to watch the place for her.  Paul is suffering from his own personal demons, and so it's obvious that they are going to repel and then attract one another, just in time for a storm to wreck the house and throw them into each others arms.

Someone else mentioned the first kiss was laughable, and yes, yes it is.

There are certain acting duos that work really well with one another, and so they show up in more films together, and it just works.  Look at Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.  Sure, the only worked together twice, but MY GOD were they amazing together.  Look at Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (I know, not a conventional `couple').  Again, only twice, but stellar both times.  Certain actors just WORK WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER.  Diane Lane and Richard Gere worked together on `Unfaithful', and they did fine.  Lane stole the whole show, and appeared in more scenes with her `other' leading man than with Gere, so it really can't be said they worked `together' so much.  Here, there is no chemistry, so it leads me to believe that they LIKE working together more than they actually work well together.  I blame this one Gere, and here is why...

Diane Lane is amazing.  She is really the only reason I'm giving this film three and not two stars.  She is just flawless.  The fact that this amazing actress only has ONE Oscar nomination (and not even a win when her performance in `Unfaithful' was leagues better than the other nominees; even Moore who was spellbinding for sure) when she has been nomination worthy a few times is just horrifying to me.  Even in this regurgitated pulp she is a breath of fresh air, truly engulfing everything that a middle-aged woman at the end of her rope should.  The drunk cleanup scene is spectacular for her, showing spunk and wit and a raw sensual appeal that she has always captivated, but it is rather age appropriate.  She never tries to play a younger character, instead she is comfortable with playing her age, and in a world obsessed with youth it is nice to see someone who is willing and able to embrace their wrinkles (and that snot on her upper lip).

And Diane, you still rock my world!

Some have balked at the manipulated ending, and yes, it is a tearjerker (although, like some others I did kind of roll my eyes and chuckle while my wife was balling her eyes out), but like I said, this is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, so you have to expect this kind of an ending.  I think that if you walk in knowing what you are getting then you can find some sort of enjoyment out of this film.  Viola Davis is great in her role (a truly outstanding supporting actress), Scott Glenn is touching (very touching), and Gere, while a tad bland (I've never really liked him) is serviceable.  See it for Lane, please, and then never watch it again.  I actually enjoyed the entire beginning, up until the storm, when everything fell off the map with its preposterous overblown predictable clichs.

But, again, this is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation.",1255305600,4,4344,4.49171974522293

There were parts of the movie that left me wondering if maybe they edited it too heavily.  The movie was only about 97 minutes long and sometimes it seemed as though it wasn't flowing the way it should, like maybe parts or explanations of things that were happening were left out that were maybe there before.

The film is poorly directed by an ageing, yet inexperienced TV director with an old fashioned shooting style, and it shows. This combined with a screenplay that has not sufficiently been flushed out and too rigorous editing (despite the short 97 minutes running time), leads to a non credible flow and build up of the love story. We don't connect and care for the characters the way we should. We simply do not believe the depth and power of their short 4 day encounter that supposedly had that much of an impact on their lives during and afterwards. The opportunities in the film to make it believable were rushed and lost. In stead we get boredom and predictability with scenes and emotions that ring false.  A different director with a better edit might have been more successful. The elements to make it work with the original story from the book, the great cast and the beautiful setting were there.

The blu-ray itself is a delight. Sharp, colorful, simply beautiful. The audio won't impress but this is understandable for a dialogue driven film like this.

The one clear minus as I see it?  Well, primarily the storyline. I have to concur with some of the critics that much of the dialogue does come off as 'formuaic',  'melodramatic' and 'cliched' ala ""Bridges Of Madison County."" However, such things are part of the romance genre whether one likes it or not.

I've known personally of a number of ""Pauls"" and ""Adriennes"" in real life, so I know that there is a grain of truth to much of the formula and cliches in this film. Moreover, I think those sparks of politically incorrect truth regarding love and romance portrayed in this film is what has made some of the critics uncomfortable. Perhaps it hits too close to home for some of them...and then leads them to 'protestesth too much' when panning this film in their reviews.

Despite the storyline, I thought Richard Gere and Diane Lane were fine actors, and they did very well with the material given to them to work with. I also enjoyed the performance of Viola Davis, too.

The pluses:

Far too many romance films seem to carry the message that love is ONLY for the under 35s. So I really appreciate it when Hollywood makes romance movies, be they drama or comedy, that feature leads who are clearly age 40 or over, and I try to support those movies whenever possible.  That's why I'm choosing to look at Nights In Rodanthe as a work in progress. Hopefully others who choose to make a genre movie with older lead actors in the romantic leads will learn from watching it what works and what does not.

For me, what really got and caught my attention about this film was the cinematography. The scenery was simply gorgeous! The camera crews captured the location so well. I like how they made some of the scenes seem just like a living painting! I also liked how the flashback scenes were used as well.

Another reason I like the movie was because of the music selection. It was great hearing all those old songs by Brook Benton, Ruth Brown and others. I really enjoyed that song by Emmylou Harris as well.

In closing, I would say that if you try to compare this movie with Casablanca or Gone With The Wind or even The Notebook, you will be disappointed. However, if you give it a chance, and judge it on its own merits, then you just might enjoy it.",1245024000,,2505,4.435729847494553

The characters, a wife whose cheating husband wants her to take him back is played by Diane Lane. Richard Gere plays a surgeon who chose his career over his family and recently had a patient die on his table. Thats about as much about these characters as the movie gives you. There is hardly any development at all, which leaves you watching a movie that might as well be about two squirrels sharing a tree and eating nuts together. It drags you through this short and awkward love story which never quite gets you to understand their feelings and does not draw you in whatsoever. The ending is also severely unsatisfying and leaves you just kind of sitting there staring at the screen and waiting for the credits to start just to make sure that yep, thats the end.

If you really want to watch it, just fast forward through it and get it over with in 10 minutes because thats all it takes. You won't miss anything. Trust me.",1242604800,,1079,4.36318407960199

When I got into the story, I couldn't help but feel for the people. Diane Lane is Adrienne; She lost her hubby to a friend, and now he wants to come back home to her. He springs his proposal just as he is about to take the kids for their weekend, and she goes to the Outer Banks to help her friend while she goes to Miami showing off her artwork. Richard Gere is a surgeon who comes to  Rodanthe to meet with the man whose wife he operated on and she died during surgery. Through the years, he was more into work, and not into family and they suffered, yet his son followed in his footsteps. He meets Diane Lane, finds that he has more in common with her; he helps her see that in spite of the hubby thing, that she is beautiful and they fall in love and have their moments before he goes off to meet his son overseas. What I truly liked about the film is the fact that the widower of the woman he operated on wanted to meet the doctor, and you could feel the love he had for her come through. To him, what she had didn't matter to him not one bit, and I can see the love and conviction in his voice. then when Adrienne showed Gere what he lacked, it helped to make him a better person. Also Adrienne's daughter was terrible to her, but when Adrienne was going through her mourning, she was the one that took care of her and finally came through for her mother.

No matter how excellent of actors these two veterans may be they could not save this movie. About halfway through I quickly realized this would be a typical Nicholas Sparks story and began predicting the end. Sure enough someone dies. Just like every other love story the author pens. Besides this there was so little character development that it was hard to genuinely care about the people. Since I knew other movies that had begun as a Nicholas Sparks book, I actually predicted about 90% of the movie. It became so hilarious that my boyfriend was in tears by the end of the movie, just because I was right about most everything. Again, I love Diane Lane, she's one of my favorite actresses; Richard Gere and she lit up the screen in Unfaithful, but this is not worth the price of a rental.

My wife April and I watched this film and instantly got the message. In our opinion...this movie tells a story about the love most people search for all of their lives and never truly find.  This is a very deeply written screenplay that will likely leave many viewers empty because they are currently in relationships that are portrayed in the movie and they feel lack.  Others who have found true love will find this a source of confirmation that they have found it.

In our opinion, this is a movie that should be watched with your teenage or older children who are unmarried.

3171451,3,B0017ANB08,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Two emotionally-impaired people connect at a Bed & Breakfast on a beach in Rodanthe
2. That's about it

Not even the ever-gorgeous Richard Gere or the reliable Diane Lane can make this sappy romance story a winner.  Add Academy Award nominee Viola Davis and Emmy nominee Christopher Meloni, and you still don't have anything to write home about.  Too bad.

Gere plays Dr. Paul Flanner, a gruff surgeon who put his career above everything else.  Lane plays Adrienne Willis, a mother of two estranged from her husband (Meloni).  As luck would have it, the same day she agrees to hotel-sit for her best friend Jean (Davis), her husband decides that it's time to mend fences.

Off to Rodanthe she goes, to discover that there's only one guest arriving, and you can easily guess who that is.  Dr. Flanner is actually in Rodanthe on business, and has plans for a long trip afterwards.  The plot also takes a trip around this point.

This bittersweet Harlequin-type romance may have you reaching for a hanky from time to time, but that's due to the performance of the stars rather than the plot. Recommended for softies, fans of the delectable Gere, and incurable romantics.

Dr. Paul Flanner: We all make choices, Adrienne. You chose that life, you chose that man. Do you even remember who you really are anymore?

Even the parts that were supposed to be highly emotional weren't for me because I could not connect with the characters or storyline. It was boring right from the beginning, dull, lifeless, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Which is sad because I thought this could be great being ""The Notebook"" is my favorite movie that I can watch over and over. This you seen it once you seen it enough.

The themes are also familiar to anyone who has seen the other films since the focus is on two tortured souls who meet fortuitously, transform each other, and face some unexpected tragedy to reinforce the eternity of their love.

If it sounds formulaic, it is with every major scene turning into some life lesson for some character. There is a long line of these sudsy melodramas -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-of-Tides/dp/B00005OLYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince of Tides</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridges-of-Madison-County/dp/B0012E2HRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridges of Madison County</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House/dp/B000HEWEE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House</a>&nbsp;come to mind - but the difference is that first-time big-screen director George C. Wolfe does not do anything to enhance the formula despite the stellar work he has done on Broadway with ""Angels in America"". Adapted by TV-movie veterans Ann Peacock and John Romano, the story starts with recent divorcee Adrienne Willis agreeing to watch her best friend Jean's B&B, a precarious-looking oceanfront property in the picturesque hamlet of Rodanthe in North Carolina's Outer Banks. Not only is she doing a vacationing Jean a favor, but she can also avoid her unfaithful ex-husband, a weekend dad who is becoming increasingly persistent about coming back to the family.

It's late in the vacation season and a hurricane is brewing, but the inn still has one reservation, a guest willing to pay double the rate to keep it open. The guest is Dr. Paul Flanner, a moody plastic surgeon who has come to Rodanthe from Raleigh to face the widower of a patient who died on his operating table. While it appears he is trying to avoid a malpractice suit, he also has family issues with an estranged son who has followed his father into the medical profession but decided to help the poor in Ecuador instead. Adrienne and Paul naturally follow the pattern of their damaged souls, and the rest is inevitable. In their third onscreen coupling, Gere and Lane are on familiar territory here, and while they perform capably, neither brings anything terribly new to the story. In fact, Lane's performance feels very much a carbon copy of her work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Tuscan-Sun/dp/B0000VD02Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Tuscan Sun</a>.

3171463,2,B0017ANB08,"A co-worker/former supervisor asked about this film in it's release week, wanting to know where to get a good price on it from local retailers.  It seems he intended to make it a Valentines day present for his spouse and despite telling him many times that Amazon is typically (on a fairly consistent basis) the cheapest place to get Blu-rays from, he was going to buy it from a brick and mortar store.

Now, in the case of this individual, from personal knowledge I know that he spends time on the eastern shores of the Carolina's seemingly every year.  I assume he and his spouse really enjoy that area, and I believe he might also have some family ties to the region, so for him, Nights in Rodanthe might be a way to enjoy sights and sounds that are very familiar.

He did get a copy of the film (or so he told me), though he was a bit perturbed by the price he was charged for it.  That said, he turned down my jestful suggestion of buying this on DVD instead of DVD as he told me that his spouse isn't the type that doesn't notice the difference between Blu-ray and regular DVD ;-)

At least with the Blu-ray he and his spouse will be able to enjoy the scenery in high definition.

Hmm, 3 paragraphs in and I have't really talked about the movie (if you've read other reviews I've done, that isn't all that typical).  That would be because, well, I already did talk about such things in the title of the review and in this case I'm trying to talk up the good as best I can before I get to the bad.

On the good side, there's 'beautiful people' in a fairly beautiful location.  More so on the Blu-ray disc version which offers excellent picture quality for a film that is ok, but which has a story that has already been done by the same writer in another location.

Without dropping a huge spoiler here, another reviewer (possibly several) mention that the story comes from a writer that just doesn't seem capable of writing a story that goes in another, less predictable, less contrived, and less manipulative direction.  If you know that in advance, then you know what you'll be getting with this film.

As I sat and watched the film with my own spouse I came further and further to the conclusion that this film's story was something that I had seen before in another film.  Even though I didn't recognize and/or hadn't paid attention to the connection, I started seeing parallels to the film Message in a Bottle.  Once I checked the details of the film and saw Nicolas Sparks name, I knew why.  Different location (barely really), but same sort of emotional manipulation.

In the end I'd say this is something that some will absolutely love, but most would likely want to miss.  Rent it first unless you are a big fan of the stars and/or unless you really loved The Notebook or Message in a Bottle.",1234569600,2,2806,4.415533980582524

Adrienne Willis, a woman in the midst of a marital split, takes some time away, while her children are with their father, to think and to nourish her spirit.

She is staying in a coastal inn, belonging to a friend.  There is one other guest - a man who is trying to find his own redemption.  A doctor who lost a patient and who is delving into his soul for answers.

These two are drawn together, and on a stormy night, a love affair begins.

When their vacation ends, they go their separate ways - Adrienne returns home and Paul Flanders goes to a small country to assist his son in his medical practice.

Their letters sustain them.  And then, unexpectedly, their lives are irretrievably torn asunder.

This lovely, romantic tale was engrossing and deeply satisfying.  I gave it four stars, however, because of the predictable theme and the all-too-familiar plot.

I would watch it again, though, just to see the pairing of Diane Lane and Richard Gere!

3171469,4,B0017ANB08,"Heartfelt and sentimental?  Well, yes, what else could NIGHTS IN RODANTHE be!? Reviewers who lower their ratings because they find this film 'mushy' or overly sentimental must be forgetting that this is a film based on a Nicholas Sparks bestseller, and Sparks is known for novels based on enduring values and themes of the heart (The Notebook; Message in a Bottle).  (Seems to me that would be like down-rating a Peckinpah film because it was 'too violent,' or a Superman film because it was too 'campy' and 'unreal.')  My point is that a film deserves to be reviewed on its own merits, whatever the genre, and this one is no exception.

Others have mentioned the masterful performances of Diane Lane and Richard Gene (in lesser hands this film might not have come together well at all), and Scott Glenn has a small but extremely affecting role and gives a standout performance.  It is the fine acting and the beautiful cinematography that carry the film, while the screenplay and directing seem lacking (it's difficult to truly care about the characters, even if Diane Lane and Richard Gere make us really WANT to care).  What elevated The Notebook (beyond, of course, the superb acting talents of James Garner and Gena Rowlands) was the skilled direction of Nick Cassavettes.  Had he directed this film I believe that it would have held together much better.

As others have written here, the performances give us characters who appear REAL, and this is one of the strengths of this film.  The words that Adrienne (Diane Lane) speaks to her daughter at the end of the film, 'Hold out for a love that allows you to be more than you are, not less...' resound because we can feel the truth in those words.  Not because we KNOW they are true, but because Diane Lane and Richard Gere took us there and showed us what a love like that looks like.  In these days of dark and violent film offerings, this film (while falling short of The Notebook) offers an uplifting and very welcome alternative.  Suspend judgment and enjoy the 'mush.'  Your day will likely be better for it!

The only reason I watched was because of the actors, who did a great job with the material they were given.  The beach scenery in NC was beautiful.  The movie was disjointed in places, making me wonder for a time what was happening at that moment.  I feel that Hallmark produces a much higher quality of romance movie than this.",1234224000,,411,4.44
3171471,4,B0017ANB08,"I liked ""Nights in Rodanthe"", and thought it was a well-acted, poignant romantic drama that tells the story about two people who meet and find love under the weight of personal loss and despair. These days, it's so difficult to find 'true' romance dramas that have no constant profanity, explicit sex and that paint a caricature of what romance is.

""Nights in Rodanthe"" stars Diane Lane as Adrienne, a married, mother of two who is separated from her husband due to his indiscretion [leaving her for another woman]. Just as the kids are preparing to spend some time with their dad, the cad returns and begs Adrienne to take him back. She tells him that she needs time to think, and its fortutious timing as she is going away to Rodanthe to help take care of her best friend's inn, a charming old building sitting on the beach on the Outer Banks in North Carolina. There is but one guest who shows up all ruffled and terse - Richard Gere who plays a doctor who has just sold off his practice and his home and is in Rodanthe on some unfinished business connected to a surgical procedure gone wrong. During the course of several days [and this reminded me so much of The Bridges of Madison County], this vulnerable and hurting pair discover they are soulmates and indulge in a passionate affair that leaves an indelible mark on both of them. All this and there's a hurricane coming too! The rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of their love affair.

The chemistry between Lane and Gere is as strong as ever [they were also good in 'Unfaithful'] and helps make the romance between them believable and credible. The scenic cinematography of the Outer Banks is absolutely breathtaking, as is the soundtrack [Dinah Washington, Brooke Benton etc]. I did feel the ending was a bit over the top, but on the whole, I did enjoy this romantic drama - it felt like a story from the heart.",1234224000,2,1882,4.56508875739645

I would definitely recommend Nights in Rodanthe to those who like a good love story with plenty of drama.",1231804800,54,450,4.6375
3171475,4,B0017ANB08,"Note: For those who haven't read the book or seen the film, spoilers appear below.

""Chick lit"" becomes ""chick flick"" as author Nicholas Sparks gets another makeover by Hollywood. I've read none of Sparks' works, but my better half and I have seen all three film versions of his modern-day tearjerkers: ""Message In a Bottle"", ""The Notebook"" and now, ""Nights in Rodanthe."" This one has all the predictable elements for this genre, but the acting by the leads (especially Lane) is solid and the scenery is phenomenal, the film having been shot around North Carolina's Cape Hatteras and on Ocracoke and Cedar Islands, all of which helps make a fairly mundane story more compelling. (I've been up and down the Outer Banks at least six times during my life, and that was much of the draw of seeing this film, especially at mid-winter.)

Of special note is the performance put in by veteran actor Scott Glenn, playing a widower waiting for an apology from the Raleigh surgeon played by Gere. Glenn, who left Hollywood earlier in his career to hang out in Idaho and earn his keep in blue-collar jobs, got the hang of the local dialect in ""Nights"" by hanging with a crabber and generally melting into the neighborhood. The craggy-faced Glenn owns his scenes with Gere, not only through pitch-perfect dialect but also with an understated yet stinging ""nuts to you, you don't get it"" attitude. When Gere's character finally visits the widower's cottage, Glenn steals the camera lock, stock and barrel. There's an acting award here somewhere, at least in my book.

Cinematically, the only fault one might find with ""Nights"" comes at the end. Rather than close ""Nights"" with the spirited shots of Lane on the beach, mesmerized by a rare migration of the wild ponies that ordinarily confine themselves to the Virginia-Carolina border, the decision was made to tack on a wide shot of key characters peering out from a boardwalk - an unnecessary, even hackneyed action that drained some of the momentum from the film in its final moments.

""Nights in Rodanthe"" isn't rocket science, but it's pretty to look at, the acting is more than workmanlike, and everyone loves a love story, right? Four stars for the film, five for Scott Glenn's performance.",1231027200,39,2233,4.868421052631579

This film wouldn't be anything that someone who has not lived a bit could get into, but if you've felt the bite of betrayal or gotten lost in the sorrow of heartache... consider this one. A definite 'give it a try...' for the older and wiser crowd, Nights in Rodanthe is something to remind us of why we should ache for more and find peace with ourselves and the world, once we've found it.",1230681600,,715,4.296296296296297

3405285,3,B0017ANB08,"If you can imagine every melodramatic romance clich ever conceived of, you'd have a pretty good idea of what ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is like. This movie is sentimental to the point of losing all credibility, which makes me wonder why Nicholas Sparks, the author of the original novel, didn't explore the idea as a parody. I say this because, with so much drama crammed into just ninety-seven minutes, many will find it impossible to take seriously. Some might even laugh incredulously. The sad thing is that it's no better than it wanted to be. Watching it, you'll find that it has no ambition other than to be a syrupy, predictable love story. Sadder still is the fact that Diane Lane and Richard Gere--both wonderful actors--give believable performances. With such varied bodies of work showcasing their talents, you'd think they would have chosen a film much more credible than this.

The plot, in all its overwrought splendor, is as follows. Adrienne Willis (Lane) has recently separated from her husband, Jack (Christopher Meloni), after he had an affair. He wants her to take him back because he knows he made a mistake. She isn't ready to make that decision, which puts her at odds with her moody teenage daughter, Amanda (Mae Whitman). As for her young son, Danny (Charlie Tahan), he has been retreating into a world of video games. When the kids go to spend the weekend with their father in Orlando, Adrienne takes a ferry to Rodanthe, North Carolina, where she will temporally run a seaside inn owned by her vacationing best friend, Jean (Viola Davis). As it turns out, Adrienne will only have to accommodate one guest, partly because it's the off-season and partly because the weather is getting stormy, almost hurricane-like.

Her guest is the recently divorced Dr. Paul Flanner (Gere), who, not surprisingly, is dealing with his own emotional turmoil. Most of it stems from his estranged son, Mark (an uncredited James Franco), who stopped talking to him after joining a medical relief effort in the remote mountains of Central America. Paul's plan is to find Mark and reconcile with him. But before he can do that, he has some business to take care of in Rodanthe; a woman named Jill Torrelson accidentally died while in his care, and now he has to face the widowed husband, Robert (Scott Glenn), and the angry son, Charlie (Pablo Schreiber), both of whom have started a Wrongful Death lawsuit. Paul reasons that he did everything he could, but the fact that he's trying to defend himself when he should be apologizing is only making things worse.

Anyway, we now have Adrienne and Paul, both heartbroken people, alone together in a ramshackle inn. And wouldn't you know it, they engage in long-winded conversations about their troubles. Then they longingly glance at each other as they share glasses of wine with dinner. Then they get into a big argument just as the hurricane approaches the North Carolina shore. As they frantically try to bolt every window shut, they realize that they're falling in love. And after celebrating the storm's end with the local folk, they're finally ready to express their love. I distinctly remember the morning after they've made love; as they lie in bed, Paul describes Adrienne's body using geographical terms. Her arm is a steep mountain. The small of her back is a deep valley. Some may see this as romantic. I see this as the cinematic equivalent to art for art's sake--it's needlessly figurative language in an overly poignant love story. Besides, how could even have a bed to make love on? Wouldn't an inn build directly on the beach be destroyed by a hurricane?

I know this movie will find an audience. The proof is in the vast number of drugstore romance novels published year after year; the people who read them are the same people who will see ""Nights in Rodanthe"" and actually be moved by it. In all likelihood, they had already read Sparks' novel and were moved before entering the theater. I might have been moved had I not seen a major event coming from a mile away. I obviously can't reveal what that event is, but I can say that it makes perfect sense given the story's reliance on melodrama. The audience is expected to cry at a certain point, and indeed, when that point was reached, I could hear sniffling all around me. Does this seem manipulative to you? It sure does to me, especially since it goes hand in hand with obligatory reconciliation scenes that are anything but plausible. No, I can't say who reconciles with whom, but it doesn't matter anyway because it's bad enough that those scenes were included in the first place.

In spite of the over-the-top romance clichs, I'm forced to praise Lane and Gere for their performances. Not only was the chemistry between them great, it seemed as if they actually believed in what they were doing as actors. Too bad they didn't put their talent to better use. Too bad they weren't cast in a film that told a realistic story. Too bad they were stuck in a love story that collapses under the weight of its sentimentality. Too bad this movie had no desire to go beyond its formulaic origins and give us something new. If this kind of filmmaking appeals to you, if you don't have a problem with weepy romances about lost souls rekindling dying embers, then by all means, go see ""Nights in Rodanthe."" It may be the most rewarding movie going experience you'll have this year.",1222819200,6,5390,4.760427807486631
3405286,5,B0017ANB08,"I went and saw this movie yesterday and i was blowen away. Richard Gere and Diane Lane have done another great movie together. Richard plays Paul Flanner who is a doctor and he comes to Rodanthe, NC to see some one. Diane plays Adrienne Willis a wife and a mother of two and is having a hard time in her life. Adrienne goes to Rodanthe to look after her best friend's Bed and Breakfast where she meets Paul Flanner and falls in love.. this movie plays on all emotions. bring tissue Ladies.",1222560000,6,489,4.326086956521739
3405287,2,B0017ANB08,"The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane periodically appears credible in the new film Nights in Rodanthe, adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. Borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's Best Picture winner Out of Africa, Nights in Rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates.

Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. In his guilt, he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in Rodanthe, North Carolina to meet with the husband (Scott Glenn), who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. The trip is on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which is to retrieve his son (James Franco) from Equador, where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.

Meanwhile, Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) is struggling with her two young children, who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. Adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband Jack (Christopher Meloni) who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. When Jack takes the kids for a spell, Adrienne travels to Rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that Dr. Flanner has booked - leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.

The love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. The unmindful, unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane - what a perfect setting for romance. Even looking past the uninspired genesis, Nights in Rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. The audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair, and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth.

It's like a sillier version of Out of Africa, but with more crying, less sweeping romance, and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. Not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score, the story has been done repeatedly (especially from Nicholas Sparks); as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile movie-going experience.

Enough gritty love & divorce elements to give appreciation to an emerging friendship.  Gere is a physician who is initially estranged from his son, but later work together in humanitarian medical services.  Diane Lane is a temporary host for a Bed & Breakfast Inn along beautiful ocean coast.

As now single with two children, Adrienne is holding down the fort for her friend on the shore of North Carolina, she has one visitor at the Inn she is looking after, this is Paul. He is there to take care of issues of an importance of his own concerning a dire surgical procedure that he cannot rid himself of the guilt over. He has broken down his strategy over and over in his mind and desires greatly to meet the husband of the woman who did not survive the surgery. As a tremendous storm is bracing down on the Inn and these two have got to survive this plus so many personal emotions twisting around them in their private lives. He tells Adrienne that ""life is all about choices"" and in how this movie plays out, this is the truest statement said. A lovely but affecting romance for grown ups and younger people alike. I wish the movie production studios would take notice that there is a great audience for relationships between people over thirty-five, forty, plus... Romantic attachments are not formed specifically during youth but from shared situations, circumstances, and camaraderie, how would these things vanish solely after being young? ...

3405362,5,B0017ANB08,"The Author of The NOTEBOOK comes another romantic film.
Again meeting with both actor RICHARD GERE and DIAN LANE.
You think they are too old to make it happen? You got it all wrong.
It earned Worldwide $84,375,061. They are still sellable.
Dian Lane is still so very charming and Richard Gere is still very handsome to make it all happen back in 2009.
Warner brothers still thought that they can make a steady romantic film out of this two actors and they did made it happened.
Some complained about these three things.
1. The daughter of Dian Lane suddenly became a good daughter when Richard dies. Yes she was a bad daughter and was a rebel. But when Dian was truly suffered by the loss of her one and only love after her divorce to the father of the daughter, the daughter felt that pain. Again this is a movie not a documentary.
2. At the end why should Richard Gere have to die to make the audience tear jerk? Can it be just a happy ending? Again this movie is based on the best selling novel.
3. The built up relationship of Richard and Dian was too fast and we don't buy that at all. No I don't think so.

Richard had a bad moment in his life by having the surgery and killed an old lady by accident.
He blamed himself all the way, blamed his skills and even came to the patient's house to say it was not his fault.
It was one in a million chance of death.
He just didn't wanted to accept that it was all his fault. He still wanted to think that he is a good doctor.
Indeed he is.
And there he meets the very, very charming hilarious woman who worked for her friend who owns the hotel near the sea who is also in trouble with her marriage.
She is dancing around while cooking, loves music that he also loves, cooks for him the most delicious foods, throws things to the garbage can like doing basketball game, shows him the most beautiful arts upstairs and then there is this deadly storm came and they were about to die and miraculously they were survived.

How can they not fall in love?

The house by the sea is so very beautiful and especially the blue room is miraculous to look at.
The seaside walk by two actors are just pure picture perfect.
The chemistry of two actors are like an old couple. Why not they are already acted many times.
UNFAITHFUL, THE COTTON CLUB and finally this movie when they are really truly gloom.
Dinah Washingtons song is supporting the scene as well. You will like the mood of it when there is moonlight, candle and wine.
One thing is missing, that is love. Eventually will come along.
This movie is for grownups.
But you will love it anyway whoever you are.
You are in the people of good hands. Someone totally believable. Trustable.",1476576000,3,2676,4.31610337972167

3405474,5,B0017ANB08,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Mrs. Willis is headed for a divorce because Mr. Willis took off on her and decided that he wanted to end the marriage.  Just before Mrs. Willis heads to Rodanthe to assist a friend by looking after her hotel due to an upcoming storm Mr. Willis has figured out that leaving his wife was a huge mistake and wants to come back home.

Dr. Flanner is visiting Rodanthe on business as he has his own demons to battle in an upcoming malpractice suit.  He ends up being the sole customer in the hotel that Mrs. Willis is watching over creating what I would call a perfect storm.  Emotions run high as passions run hot in what proves to be one electrifying  romance that would change the lives of all involved.

Mrs. Willis decides against getting back with her husband in favor of Dr. Flanner.  Sadly they must depart ways in favor of a long distance relationship as Dr. Flanner goes to assist his son in a remote country.  During their time apart they wrote letters that ultimately fanned the flames of love as they got to know each other on a much deeper level.  When alas Dr. Flanner is due to come back home to Ms. Willis the cruel hands of fate would step in and Dr. Flanner would never make it back home and into her arms.

Instead Ms. Willis was left with one single box that contained within it's walls all that was left of Dr. Flanner's material possessions the tangible proof of their love for one another.  In a way it was sad to think about because their love was so much greater and Dr Flanner's personality was so much bolder then the physical objects that would be left behind.  Yet the letters and some other odd momentos would end up being the summary of what was left of a love that would no longer be but for the mind to remember.

In the end Dr. Flanner sends Ms. Willis a sign from above that he is still with and watching over her from above.  For me the take away was ""it was better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all."" - Alfred Lord Tennyson",1442707200,,2016,4.282321899736147

3405514,3,B0017ANB08,"Can one weekend change a life?  Can Blu-ray high definition save a movie?  Yes and no.  Yes to the first question, no to the second.

Diane Lane and Richard Gere worked so well together in 2002's ""Unfaithful"" that Warner Bros. decided to pair them up in 2008's ""Nights in Rodanthe.""  The actors once again work well together, but they should have quit when they were ahead.  This time out they haven't got the script to go with their talents.

Director George C. Wolfe made his big-screen directorial debut with ""Nights in Rodanthe"" after success as a Broadway producer-director and doing several television productions.  Screenwriters Ann Peacock and John Romano based their screenplay for the movie on a novel by best-selling author Nicholas Sparks, who previously provided Hollywood with ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""A Walk to Remember,"" and ""The Notebook.""  One has to wonder if anyone besides Sparks is still writing romance novels or if Hollywood is looking to any other author for romantic material.

Lane plays a divorced woman, Adrienne Willis, with a teenaged daughter and a ten-year-old son.  Her ex-husband, Jack (Christopher Meloni), wants to get back together with her, but Adrienne cannot forgive his infidelity.  She has devoted her life to her husband and children and now feels betrayed by his unfaithfulness.  To compound matters, her daughter hates her for not allowing the father to return to the fold, and the son finds himself bewildered by it all.

Gere plays Dr. Paul Flanner, a divorced surgeon who has even more problems than Adrienne.  He always put his career ahead of his family, one of his female patients accidentally died in a surgery he was performing on her, he's being sued by the woman's husband (Scott Glenn), his wife has left him, and his grown son (James Franco), also a doctor, hates him.  Whew!

Coincidentally, both Adrienne and Paul wind up in the same isolated inn together in Rodanthe, a small town on the North Carolina coast.  She is taking care of the inn for a friend (Viola Davis), and at the moment Paul is the only guest.

Misery loves comfort, I suppose, because Adrienne and Paul quickly find they have a lot in common in terms of personal issues and just as quickly fall into one another's arms.

Frankly, that's about it, except for the ending, which I'll get to in a moment.  The story moves along like a two-person filmed stage play.  Lane and Gere are in practically every scene together after the initial exposition, and there is only so much a viewer can stand of their empty talk.  This is Nicholas Sparks, after all, not Eugene O'Neill, and it's ""Nights in Rodanthe,"" not ""Long Day's Journey into Night.""  So we can see what's coming at least two hankies ahead of time.

Yes, it's good to see a straight romantic movie that involves mature people for a change instead of endless, witless romantic comedies about twenty-year-olds.  But a good romance has to have substance, too, or there's not a lot of reason for it beyond fulfilling some basic need for potboilers.  Here, we get a man who loves Dinah Washington songs, a woman with an old phonograph and even older LPs, and a fairy-tale inn that looks like something out of ""Lemony Snicket.""  It's that kind of movie.

To punctuate the couple's dilemmas, the author throws in a hurricane, which seems severe enough to have blown the whole house down but doesn't.  From there, the story gets increasingly passionate, melodramatic, and, finally, maudlin.

The ""finally"" is the ending, which makes you go ""Ah, come on!""  It is as unlikely an event as you'll ever come across, and the author clearly intended it only as a manipulative plot device.  If the rest of the film simply bores you, the ending will infuriate you.  Come on, Sparks; you're better than that.

Up until its conclusion, ""Nights in Rodanthe"" is a reasonably romantic story that just happens to make for a mediocre film.  It resembles more and more a soap opera as it goes along and then does something unforgivable at the close.

Loved ""The Notebook""; could have done without ""Nights.""

Video:
The movie is fairly short at only ninety-seven minutes, so Warners went with a single-layer BD25 to accommodate it.  Then they used a VC-1 encode to transfer the 2.40:1-ratio widescreen picture to disc at 1080p.  As there is nothing about the image or the colors that jumps off the screen, it's sometimes hard to tell if the movie is in high definition or not without a direct comparison to the standard-def version.  If you do make the comparison, you'll find the Blu-ray sharper and the hues marginally deeper, but it's close because the filmmakers chose to keep the image somewhat soft and pale most of the time.  A few bright outdoor shots show us how good the high-def picture can be, though, and that's still pretty good.

Audio:
For whatever reason, WB reverted to their old ways of going on the cheap with the audio, giving us only a lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on this Blu-ray disc.  Granted, the soundtrack is about 99% talk, which doesn't really cry out for lossless audio, but, still, I've always thought ""high-definition"" referred to high-def picture AND sound.  Oh, well.  There is a storm about halfway through the movie where rain, wind, and thunder roar all around us, the deep bass rumbles authoritatively, and a few dynamic jolts practically knock the walls of one's listening room down.  It's plenty good in Dolby Digital, but it leaves one wondering how much better it might have sounded in something like Dolby TrueHD.

Extras:
The extras are exclusive to the Blu-ray disc, and mostly they comprise a series of brief featurettes, all of them in high def.  The first and longest is ""The Nature of Love,"" twenty-one minutes on the author, the filmmakers, and the stars.  Next is ""An Intimate Look at In Rodanthe with Singer/Songwriter Emmylou Harris,"" twelve minutes with Ms. Harris, who explains this was the first time she had written a song directly for a movie.  After that, we get five alternative scenes with a director commentary, totaling about seven minutes; followed by ""A Time for Love:  Keeping Up With Nicholas Sparks,"" eleven minutes with the author of fourteen best-selling novels; and a music video, ""Love Remains the Same,"" with Gavin Rossdale.

Things conclude with some further exclusive features via BD-Live; twenty-five scene selections but no bookmarks; a slipcover for the Blu-ray case; a bonus digital copy disc of the film, compatible with iTunes and Windows Media; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
We've all come to expect a considerable amount of sentimentality in a love story; it comes with the territory.  It's just that ""Nights in Rodanthe"" lays it on so thick, you'd think the author had written it for folks who had never read or seen another romance before.  If you like the actors, you'll probably like the movie for Lane and Gere alone.  It's a shame they didn't have more to work with.

3405530,5,B0017ANB08,"There are people who might dismiss this movie as ""just another small, mediocre romantic drama from Hollywood.""

They would be wrong, because Nights in Rodanthe is an amazing movie. Sure, it is a bittersweet tale about fate who joins two strangers together, and a tragic turn of events that destroys that bond. But there is so much tenderness and beauty in this film, I find it mind-blowing.

There are little moments (which are actually huge), like Adrienne's reply to Paul who is soaked in negativity after a troublesome encounter (chapter 8 in the DVD), which is a little miracle, because we watch in wonder how that humble, loving response disarms and dissolves Paul's negativity, and invites love into their lives. This is my favorite scene in this movie, but there are many other great moments as well.

The acting of the entire cast is great, and the soundtrack is very effective and touching.

In spite of the fact that there is a sad ending to this love story, the movie ends with a hopeful note, that sometimes we have to rise from the ashes of the disasters that storm into our lives and nearly destroy us, and continue our journey in life towards a better future.

So, please don't let the cynics fool you, this is a great film, and the credit goes to Nicholas Sparks, director George C. Wolfe, and everyone who was involved in this great production.",1428969600,,1361,4.677824267782427

Talk about yanking at the heart strings, with this story he tears the heart right out of the chest and stomps on it on the ground. To be fair to the author, I haven't read the book, but I imagine it is just as heart-wrenching as this love story that blindsides you... I just didn't see it coming, what happened, but won't say more in case you do not know the story yet. I thought I was signed up for a nice, light-hearted romantic comedy. Then again, this is a Nicholas Sparks story, so that was not the smartest assumption on my part. I do love most of Nicholas Sparks' works. Although this was well acted, I regretted watching it, feeling emotional and weepy the rest of the weekend. Real life is painful enough.

It was riddled by lots of contrivances and implausibilities that one logical viewer may find it purely cinematic and made to appease one's romantic feelings and sentimentality. Also,it was worth noting that it was also an unabashedly melodramatic and a tearjerker that will appeal to teen-agers who are falling in love for the first time and young adults who are experiencing romance for the first time.

In their first, ""Unfaithful"", their acting abilities are evident as they find themselves in uncharted waters as a married couple. In ""Nights in Rodanthe"" they find each other as divorced or separated from their former partners and explore each other's lives, mistakes and opportunities. They each have as actors numerous chances to show their emotions. They both rise to the challenges. I hope they find another vehicle in which to act together again.",1385251200,,536,5.033707865168539

Of course I have to give a little credit to Nicholas Sparks who wrote the book--a master at romance. It's not gushy, mushy or cutesy. It's just a wonderful story of two people coming together and then tragically torn apart. Get out your hankies!",1377043200,,339,4.396825396825397

It showed wonderful local flair but also got to the very depth of human frailty.  We all want to be liked.  I think Richard Gere and Diane Lane were perfect for this movie.

3405758,3,B0017ANB08,"How odd that james franco is not mentioned in the film's credits or advertising--he was an established movie actor by 2008. This movie has high production values-beautifully shot in lovely locations---for me the story was too contrived -like the beach house-('unfaithful'-with gere and lane is better) but it is worth seeing especially as it is a mature love story. Ageism is alive and well in 2013 with some reviewers critical of anyone over 40 making love. Diane lane's acting is moving. Gere's has always puzzled me----when he is required to emote-his face goes blank for 10 seconds and he stares into space before reacting--it happens in all his movies. Finally-it makes me smile when reviewers say 'it wasn't like the book'----they bring their own pre-conceived images from the book to the film and of course they won't match,also a book ,filmed literally page for page, would last 10 hours. It is wise not to read any book before seeing the movie---",1369958400,,955,4.937888198757764

Lite fare, chic flick.
I liked so many parts of this movie:  good actors, fairly well developed characters, the beauty of the Carolina beaches in widescreen.  There are some good messages:  for mothers and daughters, risk taking, returning to your passions, and continuing to develop and learn about life and to grow no matter our age and stage in life.  My favorite movies have plot twists surprises (there are not many good surprises in movies these days), I really appreciate that this movie has a couple of gritty plot twists that caught me off guard.

I do wish this writer were not so casual about physical relationships outside of marriage, but I know that in today's world I am in the minority; having said that I do not find it overly gratuitous in the movie, and it does fit the storyline.

And did I mention the breathtaking beauty of the Carolina beaches. If you also are a beach lover you MUST see this movie in the widescreen edition.",1347062400,,1141,5.418079096045198

It was the candlelight dinner that made me nauseous----what a terrible script!!  One trite cliche after another.  I wonder how these actors got through it?  Maybe they were so glad to have starring roles at their age?  Too bad.  They are both attractive aging people and it would have been nice to see them in a script that honored that place in their lives.  This was an embarrassment!

That said, what happened later in the plot was a downer. If you haven't seen it, but want to, go ahead. Overall, it's not a bad story, but be prepared for a tearjerker ending, similar to Kevin Costner's movie, Message in a Bottle.",1329523200,,539,4.39

I did check out some reviews before starting to watch it so I could get an idea of what I was getting myself into. I was definitely unimpressed with most of the movie. Diane Lane and Richard Gere's relationship in the movie just seemed too forced and not real in any sense. They just didn't seem to have any chemistry. Usually, I'm able to at least believe that characters such as these would want to be together. It just wasn't happening for me, though. I haven't seen either of them in too many other movies, so I can't comment on their acting abilities in general justifiably. This is one of those movies that I wouldn't really recommend to others to see. To be completely honest, I thought that Mae Whitman's performance was one of the better ones in this movie. I have seen a few movies that were worse than this one. If I thought it was 100% bad, then I would've given it 1 star. There were a few redeeming qualities in it, though, so I went with 3 stars.

3405854,4,B0017ANB08,"People are slamming this romantic drama for being too predictable and sappy. Well, they are right in one sense, but wrong in another. Yes, the film is predictable, but it isn't about the predictability but how characters deal with certain unpredictable things in life. Sappy? Yes, but, again, this deals with certain feelings, provoked and unprovoked, that lay dormant in all of us.

There was some unnecessary melodramatic acting about midway through that kind of put me off (hence the 4 stars), but the rest was good. I can see where people were put off by this melodrama, because I was a bit turned off by the over-dramatic acting about midway through, but I feel the story had a lot of depth.

There are a range of emotions in this film, from love to bitterness, from anger to forgiveness. There are things in life that will always take us by surprise, and none more so than falling in love with someone then they die before you really have the chance to get to know them. I know from my own experience in life. This film hit close to home with me. Yes, I have had something very similar to this happen to me, so it was something I could relate to on a personal level. I met someone one night at a party after work, and it was mutual that we liked each other, and planned on doing something the next evening. He died in a car wreck on the way home, and I was the last person to see him alive. Something I never got closure on...

I, too, saw the outcome of this coming; but I didn't see the way a certain character was gonna deal with the end result. Fabulous performances all across the board: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Scott Glenn, and Pablo Schreiber all give top-notch performances in this, some roles larger than others; but all important to the overall story.

I wanted to see this when it came out because of Gere and Lane, but normally I don't fall for that 'hey they were in that and now they're in this' fad; but those two, well, that`s an exception to the rule that I`ll break gladly. Anyways, I was really impressed with this. Even if the story didn't hit close to home with everybody, I still feel it was a really good film.

Critics ravaged this upon release, but luckily I ignored them; and I am so glad I did!
Awesome direction, acting, and some breath taking scenery make this a very pleasant viewing experience. This is on the same par as the two previous films Gere and Lane did together, Francis Coppolla'a ""The Cotton Club"" (1984) and Adrian Lynne's ""Unfaithful"" (2002).

Basic plot: A divorced woman (Lane) meets a single doctor (Gere) while he is on vacation to deal with a grieving father (Glenn) and son (Schreiber). The two fall in love and the rest is, well, for you to see and find out for yourself. Highly recommended!

But you still feel good about the ending, because the two people did fall in love. Director Nick Cassavetes did a great job of turning this book into a good movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't have the usual hang-up of ""the book was so much better than the movie."" I just know that I like Richard Gere and I love Diane Lane.

The two worthy leads not seeming to try very hard, with Gere perhaps faring better than Lane... whose part seems to be not as well-written as that of the male-lead. It's too bad that one of the few recent cinematic attempts to explore mature adult-relationships, among still very attractive protagonists, lapses into the banal and predictable, with a cheap and too-easy emotional trick at the conclusion. Of note, however, is the fine and understated... though powerful performance of supporting player, Scott Glenn... a wonderful example of: acting without seeming to act... and still conveying volumes. Mr. Gere and Ms. Lane should have paid closer attention!

I'm glad that I didn't see this in the theatre, and waited... instead, until its release on DVD, as its worth would not have been equal to the price of admission.

3405881,4,B0017ANB08,"People are slamming this romantic drama for being too predictable and sappy. Well, they are right in one sense, but wrong in another. Yes, the film is predictable, but it isn't about the predictability but how characters deal with certain unpredictable things in life. Sappy? Yes, but, again, this deals with certain feelings, provoked and unprovoked, that lay dormant in all of us. There are a range of emotions in this film, from love to bitterness, from anger to forgiveness. There are things in life that will always take us by surprise, and none more so than falling in love with someone then they die before you really have the chance to get to know them. I know from my own experience in life...Yes, I have had something very similar to this happen to me.
I, too, saw the outcome of this coming; but I didn't see the way a certain character was gonna deal with the end result. Fabulous performances all across the board: Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Scott Glenn, and Pablo Schreiber all give top-notch performances in this, some roles larger than others; but all important to the overall story.
Critics ravaged this upon release, but luckily I ignored them; and I am so glad I did!
Awesome direction, acting, and some breath taking scenery make this a very pleasant viewing experience. This is on the same par as the two previous films Gere and Lane did together, Francis Coppolla'a ""The Cotton Club"" (1984) and Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" (2002).
Basic plot: A divorced woman (Lane) meets a single doctor (Gere) while he is on vacaton to deal with a greiving father (Glenn) and son (Schreiber). The two fall in love and the rest is, well, for you to see and find out for yourself. Highly recommended!

3405888,3,B0017ANB08,"One should know walking into a movie adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks book that they are going to have their emotions manipulated; that is just how he works.  I have not read a single novel from the man, although my wife has read them all (and I mean THEM ALL), but I have seen a number of his movies, and they all are pretty much the same.  I generally like them (I thought that `A Walk to Remember' was wonderful, `The Notebook' was impressive and `Message in a Bottle' was memorable) and, while I do like `Nights in Rodanthe' it is by far the least successful of the four.

The film, sadly, doesn't know how to make its overwrought clich seem somewhat inviting.  Instead, it winds up feeling like a middle-aged revival of an overly dramatic teen film.  It doesn't really make the distinction it needs to in order to create a real feeling of adult love.

The film tells the story of Adrienne Willis, an older mother of two whose husband left her seven months ago for another woman and is now on his knees begging for another chance.  While he is away with the kids (manipulating them into taking his side), Adrienne is helping out a friend who owns a sea-side bed and breakfast.  Her friend, Jean, is going to be out of town and was going to shut the place down, but Dr. Paul Flanner offered to pay double if he could stay there, so Jean asks Adrienne to watch the place for her.  Paul is suffering from his own personal demons, and so it's obvious that they are going to repel and then attract one another, just in time for a storm to wreck the house and throw them into each others arms.

Someone else mentioned the first kiss was laughable, and yes, yes it is.

There are certain acting duos that work really well with one another, and so they show up in more films together, and it just works.  Look at Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.  Sure, the only worked together twice, but MY GOD were they amazing together.  Look at Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (I know, not a conventional `couple').  Again, only twice, but stellar both times.  Certain actors just WORK WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER.  Diane Lane and Richard Gere worked together on `Unfaithful', and they did fine.  Lane stole the whole show, and appeared in more scenes with her `other' leading man than with Gere, so it really can't be said they worked `together' so much.  Here, there is no chemistry, so it leads me to believe that they LIKE working together more than they actually work well together.  I blame this one Gere, and here is why...

Diane Lane is amazing.  She is really the only reason I'm giving this film three and not two stars.  She is just flawless.  The fact that this amazing actress only has ONE Oscar nomination (and not even a win when her performance in `Unfaithful' was leagues better than the other nominees; even Moore who was spellbinding for sure) when she has been nomination worthy a few times is just horrifying to me.  Even in this regurgitated pulp she is a breath of fresh air, truly engulfing everything that a middle-aged woman at the end of her rope should.  The drunk cleanup scene is spectacular for her, showing spunk and wit and a raw sensual appeal that she has always captivated, but it is rather age appropriate.  She never tries to play a younger character, instead she is comfortable with playing her age, and in a world obsessed with youth it is nice to see someone who is willing and able to embrace their wrinkles (and that snot on her upper lip).

And Diane, you still rock my world!

Some have balked at the manipulated ending, and yes, it is a tearjerker (although, like some others I did kind of roll my eyes and chuckle while my wife was balling her eyes out), but like I said, this is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, so you have to expect this kind of an ending.  I think that if you walk in knowing what you are getting then you can find some sort of enjoyment out of this film.  Viola Davis is great in her role (a truly outstanding supporting actress), Scott Glenn is touching (very touching), and Gere, while a tad bland (I've never really liked him) is serviceable.  See it for Lane, please, and then never watch it again.  I actually enjoyed the entire beginning, up until the storm, when everything fell off the map with its preposterous overblown predictable clichs.

But, again, this is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation.",1255305600,4,4344,4.49171974522293

5. Watching Gere and Lane kiss, especially in the driveway scene, was like watching two senior citizens grappling around in the dark. Zero chemistry, zero passion, and actual fumbling. Yeach!

Maybe they should cast Gere with someone he can't stand. At least in An Officer and a Gentleman he and Debra Winger were passionate even if it was only in their dislike for one another off screen.

There were parts of the movie that left me wondering if maybe they edited it too heavily.  The movie was only about 97 minutes long and sometimes it seemed as though it wasn't flowing the way it should, like maybe parts or explanations of things that were happening were left out that were maybe there before.

The film is poorly directed by an ageing, yet inexperienced TV director with an old fashioned shooting style, and it shows. This combined with a screenplay that has not sufficiently been flushed out and too rigorous editing (despite the short 97 minutes running time), leads to a non credible flow and build up of the love story. We don't connect and care for the characters the way we should. We simply do not believe the depth and power of their short 4 day encounter that supposedly had that much of an impact on their lives during and afterwards. The opportunities in the film to make it believable were rushed and lost. In stead we get boredom and predictability with scenes and emotions that ring false.  A different director with a better edit might have been more successful. The elements to make it work with the original story from the book, the great cast and the beautiful setting were there.

The blu-ray itself is a delight. Sharp, colorful, simply beautiful. The audio won't impress but this is understandable for a dialogue driven film like this.

3405904,3,B0017ANB08,"To be honest, the critics really are not that far off the mark, despite some of their extremism and virulence in their panning of this film. Nights In Rodanthe has its minuses to be sure, but it's not as bad a film as the critics would have you think.

The one clear minus as I see it?  Well, primarily the storyline. I have to concur with some of the critics that much of the dialogue does come off as 'formuaic',  'melodramatic' and 'cliched' ala ""Bridges Of Madison County."" However, such things are part of the romance genre whether one likes it or not.

I've known personally of a number of ""Pauls"" and ""Adriennes"" in real life, so I know that there is a grain of truth to much of the formula and cliches in this film. Moreover, I think those sparks of politically incorrect truth regarding love and romance portrayed in this film is what has made some of the critics uncomfortable. Perhaps it hits too close to home for some of them...and then leads them to 'protestesth too much' when panning this film in their reviews.

Despite the storyline, I thought Richard Gere and Diane Lane were fine actors, and they did very well with the material given to them to work with. I also enjoyed the performance of Viola Davis, too.

The pluses:

Far too many romance films seem to carry the message that love is ONLY for the under 35s. So I really appreciate it when Hollywood makes romance movies, be they drama or comedy, that feature leads who are clearly age 40 or over, and I try to support those movies whenever possible.  That's why I'm choosing to look at Nights In Rodanthe as a work in progress. Hopefully others who choose to make a genre movie with older lead actors in the romantic leads will learn from watching it what works and what does not.

For me, what really got and caught my attention about this film was the cinematography. The scenery was simply gorgeous! The camera crews captured the location so well. I like how they made some of the scenes seem just like a living painting! I also liked how the flashback scenes were used as well.

Another reason I like the movie was because of the music selection. It was great hearing all those old songs by Brook Benton, Ruth Brown and others. I really enjoyed that song by Emmylou Harris as well.

In closing, I would say that if you try to compare this movie with Casablanca or Gone With The Wind or even The Notebook, you will be disappointed. However, if you give it a chance, and judge it on its own merits, then you just might enjoy it.",1245024000,,2505,4.435729847494553

The characters, a wife whose cheating husband wants her to take him back is played by Diane Lane. Richard Gere plays a surgeon who chose his career over his family and recently had a patient die on his table. Thats about as much about these characters as the movie gives you. There is hardly any development at all, which leaves you watching a movie that might as well be about two squirrels sharing a tree and eating nuts together. It drags you through this short and awkward love story which never quite gets you to understand their feelings and does not draw you in whatsoever. The ending is also severely unsatisfying and leaves you just kind of sitting there staring at the screen and waiting for the credits to start just to make sure that yep, thats the end.

If you really want to watch it, just fast forward through it and get it over with in 10 minutes because thats all it takes. You won't miss anything. Trust me.",1242604800,,1079,4.36318407960199

The story is more Nicholas Sparks emotion-by-the-numbers, and it adds up to less than zero. There is no sizzle between the actors, and the so the director resorts to camera tricks and mood lighting in a failed attempt to inject some life into this dead story.  The only moments of genuine sentiment are when veteran actor Scott Glenn, as a grieving husband, is on the screen.  He manages to convey something real; but the rest is just hollowness.

When I got into the story, I couldn't help but feel for the people. Diane Lane is Adrienne; She lost her hubby to a friend, and now he wants to come back home to her. He springs his proposal just as he is about to take the kids for their weekend, and she goes to the Outer Banks to help her friend while she goes to Miami showing off her artwork. Richard Gere is a surgeon who comes to  Rodanthe to meet with the man whose wife he operated on and she died during surgery. Through the years, he was more into work, and not into family and they suffered, yet his son followed in his footsteps. He meets Diane Lane, finds that he has more in common with her; he helps her see that in spite of the hubby thing, that she is beautiful and they fall in love and have their moments before he goes off to meet his son overseas. What I truly liked about the film is the fact that the widower of the woman he operated on wanted to meet the doctor, and you could feel the love he had for her come through. To him, what she had didn't matter to him not one bit, and I can see the love and conviction in his voice. then when Adrienne showed Gere what he lacked, it helped to make him a better person. Also Adrienne's daughter was terrible to her, but when Adrienne was going through her mourning, she was the one that took care of her and finally came through for her mother.

The acting is amazing. Richard Gere has always been one of my favorite actors. I actually saw Diane Lane for the first time in Unfaithful playing Richard's cheating wife. The two have amazing chemistry and are very believable as a couple.

I should have known better. I didn't have a warm fuzzy feeling prior to renting this movie, but thought I would give it a chance because of Diane Lane and Richard Gere. No matter how excellent of actors these two veterans may be they could not save this movie. About halfway through I quickly realized this would be a typical Nicholas Sparks story and began predicting the end. Sure enough someone dies. Just like every other love story the author pens. Besides this there was so little character development that it was hard to genuinely care about the people. Since I knew other movies that had begun as a Nicholas Sparks book, I actually predicted about 90% of the movie. It became so hilarious that my boyfriend was in tears by the end of the movie, just because I was right about most everything. Again, I love Diane Lane, she's one of my favorite actresses; Richard Gere and she lit up the screen in Unfaithful, but this is not worth the price of a rental.

My wife April and I watched this film and instantly got the message. In our opinion...this movie tells a story about the love most people search for all of their lives and never truly find.  This is a very deeply written screenplay that will likely leave many viewers empty because they are currently in relationships that are portrayed in the movie and they feel lack.  Others who have found true love will find this a source of confirmation that they have found it.

In our opinion, this is a movie that should be watched with your teenage or older children who are unmarried.  If you watch this along with Fireproof, you can use both films as a valuable teaching tool to help your unmarried children learn about love and marriage without making the mistakes that both movies address.

It's almost as though a whole bunch of elements were added because that's what a story like this is supposed to have, but they didn't seem very convincing. I have not read the book, so perhaps the book is a bit more developed. I was actually kind of surprised the house stood through the whole movie. It had waves lapping at the supports during good weather then a storm hits that's so violent it shakes the house and knocks a bookshelf over, but the next day it looks as if not a grain of sand has washed off the beach.

3405948,3,B0017ANB08,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Two emotionally-impaired people connect at a Bed & Breakfast on a beach in Rodanthe
2. That's about it

Not even the ever-gorgeous Richard Gere or the reliable Diane Lane can make this sappy romance story a winner.  Add Academy Award nominee Viola Davis and Emmy nominee Christopher Meloni, and you still don't have anything to write home about.  Too bad.

Gere plays Dr. Paul Flanner, a gruff surgeon who put his career above everything else.  Lane plays Adrienne Willis, a mother of two estranged from her husband (Meloni).  As luck would have it, the same day she agrees to hotel-sit for her best friend Jean (Davis), her husband decides that it's time to mend fences.

Off to Rodanthe she goes, to discover that there's only one guest arriving, and you can easily guess who that is.  Dr. Flanner is actually in Rodanthe on business, and has plans for a long trip afterwards.  The plot also takes a trip around this point.

This bittersweet Harlequin-type romance may have you reaching for a hanky from time to time, but that's due to the performance of the stars rather than the plot. Recommended for softies, fans of the delectable Gere, and incurable romantics.

Dr. Paul Flanner: We all make choices, Adrienne. You chose that life, you chose that man. Do you even remember who you really are anymore?

The themes are also familiar to anyone who has seen the other films since the focus is on two tortured souls who meet fortuitously, transform each other, and face some unexpected tragedy to reinforce the eternity of their love.

Wolfe does not do anything to enhance the formula despite the stellar work he has done on Broadway with ""Angels in America"". Adapted by TV-movie veterans Ann Peacock and John Romano, the story starts with recent divorcee Adrienne Willis agreeing to watch her best friend Jean's B&B, a precarious-looking oceanfront property in the picturesque hamlet of Rodanthe in North Carolina's Outer Banks. Not only is she doing a vacationing Jean a favor, but she can also avoid her unfaithful ex-husband, a weekend dad who is becoming increasingly persistent about coming back to the family.

It's late in the vacation season and a hurricane is brewing, but the inn still has one reservation, a guest willing to pay double the rate to keep it open. The guest is Dr. Paul Flanner, a moody plastic surgeon who has come to Rodanthe from Raleigh to face the widower of a patient who died on his operating table. While it appears he is trying to avoid a malpractice suit, he also has family issues with an estranged son who has followed his father into the medical profession but decided to help the poor in Ecuador instead. Adrienne and Paul naturally follow the pattern of their damaged souls, and the rest is inevitable. In their third onscreen coupling, Gere and Lane are on familiar territory here, and while they perform capably, neither brings anything terribly new to the story. In fact, Lane's performance feels very much a carbon copy of her work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Tuscan-Sun/dp/B0000VD02Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Tuscan Sun</a>.

Instead, we are given a big-budget Lifetime TV-movie that moves glacially until a hectic montage of letters leads to the unsurprising resolution.

3405960,2,B0017ANB08,"A co-worker/former supervisor asked about this film in it's release week, wanting to know where to get a good price on it from local retailers.  It seems he intended to make it a Valentines day present for his spouse and despite telling him many times that Amazon is typically (on a fairly consistent basis) the cheapest place to get Blu-rays from, he was going to buy it from a brick and mortar store.

Now, in the case of this individual, from personal knowledge I know that he spends time on the eastern shores of the Carolina's seemingly every year.  I assume he and his spouse really enjoy that area, and I believe he might also have some family ties to the region, so for him, Nights in Rodanthe might be a way to enjoy sights and sounds that are very familiar.

He did get a copy of the film (or so he told me), though he was a bit perturbed by the price he was charged for it.  That said, he turned down my jestful suggestion of buying this on DVD instead of DVD as he told me that his spouse isn't the type that doesn't notice the difference between Blu-ray and regular DVD ;-)

At least with the Blu-ray he and his spouse will be able to enjoy the scenery in high definition.

Hmm, 3 paragraphs in and I have't really talked about the movie (if you've read other reviews I've done, that isn't all that typical).  That would be because, well, I already did talk about such things in the title of the review and in this case I'm trying to talk up the good as best I can before I get to the bad.

On the good side, there's 'beautiful people' in a fairly beautiful location.  More so on the Blu-ray disc version which offers excellent picture quality for a film that is ok, but which has a story that has already been done by the same writer in another location.

Without dropping a huge spoiler here, another reviewer (possibly several) mention that the story comes from a writer that just doesn't seem capable of writing a story that goes in another, less predictable, less contrived, and less manipulative direction.  If you know that in advance, then you know what you'll be getting with this film.

As I sat and watched the film with my own spouse I came further and further to the conclusion that this film's story was something that I had seen before in another film.  Even though I didn't recognize and/or hadn't paid attention to the connection, I started seeing parallels to the film Message in a Bottle.  Once I checked the details of the film and saw Nicolas Sparks name, I knew why.  Different location (barely really), but same sort of emotional manipulation.

In the end I'd say this is something that some will absolutely love, but most would likely want to miss.  Rent it first unless you are a big fan of the stars and/or unless you really loved The Notebook or Message in a Bottle.",1234569600,2,2806,4.415533980582524

Adrienne Willis, a woman in the midst of a marital split, takes some time away, while her children are with their father, to think and to nourish her spirit.

She is staying in a coastal inn, belonging to a friend.  There is one other guest - a man who is trying to find his own redemption.  A doctor who lost a patient and who is delving into his soul for answers.

These two are drawn together, and on a stormy night, a love affair begins.

When their vacation ends, they go their separate ways - Adrienne returns home and Paul Flanders goes to a small country to assist his son in his medical practice.

Their letters sustain them.  And then, unexpectedly, their lives are irretrievably torn asunder.

This lovely, romantic tale was engrossing and deeply satisfying.  I gave it four stars, however, because of the predictable theme and the all-too-familiar plot.

I would watch it again, though, just to see the pairing of Diane Lane and Richard Gere!

3405966,4,B0017ANB08,"Heartfelt and sentimental?  Well, yes, what else could NIGHTS IN RODANTHE be!? Reviewers who lower their ratings because they find this film 'mushy' or overly sentimental must be forgetting that this is a film based on a Nicholas Sparks bestseller, and Sparks is known for novels based on enduring values and themes of the heart (The Notebook; Message in a Bottle).  (Seems to me that would be like down-rating a Peckinpah film because it was 'too violent,' or a Superman film because it was too 'campy' and 'unreal.')  My point is that a film deserves to be reviewed on its own merits, whatever the genre, and this one is no exception.

Others have mentioned the masterful performances of Diane Lane and Richard Gene (in lesser hands this film might not have come together well at all), and Scott Glenn has a small but extremely affecting role and gives a standout performance.  It is the fine acting and the beautiful cinematography that carry the film, while the screenplay and directing seem lacking (it's difficult to truly care about the characters, even if Diane Lane and Richard Gere make us really WANT to care).  What elevated The Notebook (beyond, of course, the superb acting talents of James Garner and Gena Rowlands) was the skilled direction of Nick Cassavettes.  Had he directed this film I believe that it would have held together much better.

As others have written here, the performances give us characters who appear REAL, and this is one of the strengths of this film.  The words that Adrienne (Diane Lane) speaks to her daughter at the end of the film, 'Hold out for a love that allows you to be more than you are, not less...' resound because we can feel the truth in those words.  Not because we KNOW they are true, but because Diane Lane and Richard Gere took us there and showed us what a love like that looks like.  In these days of dark and violent film offerings, this film (while falling short of The Notebook) offers an uplifting and very welcome alternative.  Suspend judgment and enjoy the 'mush.'  Your day will likely be better for it!

3405967,2,B0017ANB08,"I felt this was a rather boring, predictable story, and very slow to get started.  The only reason I watched was because of the actors, who did a great job with the material they were given.  The beach scenery in NC was beautiful.  The movie was disjointed in places, making me wonder for a time what was happening at that moment.  I feel that Hallmark produces a much higher quality of romance movie than this.",1234224000,,411,4.44
3405968,4,B0017ANB08,"I liked ""Nights in Rodanthe"", and thought it was a well-acted, poignant romantic drama that tells the story about two people who meet and find love under the weight of personal loss and despair. These days, it's so difficult to find 'true' romance dramas that have no constant profanity, explicit sex and that paint a caricature of what romance is.

""Nights in Rodanthe"" stars Diane Lane as Adrienne, a married, mother of two who is separated from her husband due to his indiscretion [leaving her for another woman]. Just as the kids are preparing to spend some time with their dad, the cad returns and begs Adrienne to take him back. She tells him that she needs time to think, and its fortutious timing as she is going away to Rodanthe to help take care of her best friend's inn, a charming old building sitting on the beach on the Outer Banks in North Carolina. There is but one guest who shows up all ruffled and terse - Richard Gere who plays a doctor who has just sold off his practice and his home and is in Rodanthe on some unfinished business connected to a surgical procedure gone wrong. During the course of several days [and this reminded me so much of The Bridges of Madison County], this vulnerable and hurting pair discover they are soulmates and indulge in a passionate affair that leaves an indelible mark on both of them. All this and there's a hurricane coming too! The rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of their love affair.

The chemistry between Lane and Gere is as strong as ever [they were also good in 'Unfaithful'] and helps make the romance between them believable and credible. The scenic cinematography of the Outer Banks is absolutely breathtaking, as is the soundtrack [Dinah Washington, Brooke Benton etc]. I did feel the ending was a bit over the top, but on the whole, I did enjoy this romantic drama - it felt like a story from the heart.",1234224000,2,1882,4.56508875739645

I would definitely recommend Nights in Rodanthe to those who like a good love story with plenty of drama.",1231804800,54,450,4.6375
3405972,4,B0017ANB08,"Note: For those who haven't read the book or seen the film, spoilers appear below.

""Chick lit"" becomes ""chick flick"" as author Nicholas Sparks gets another makeover by Hollywood. I've read none of Sparks' works, but my better half and I have seen all three film versions of his modern-day tearjerkers: ""Message In a Bottle"", ""The Notebook"" and now, ""Nights in Rodanthe."" This one has all the predictable elements for this genre, but the acting by the leads (especially Lane) is solid and the scenery is phenomenal, the film having been shot around North Carolina's Cape Hatteras and on Ocracoke and Cedar Islands, all of which helps make a fairly mundane story more compelling. (I've been up and down the Outer Banks at least six times during my life, and that was much of the draw of seeing this film, especially at mid-winter.)

Of special note is the performance put in by veteran actor Scott Glenn, playing a widower waiting for an apology from the Raleigh surgeon played by Gere. Glenn, who left Hollywood earlier in his career to hang out in Idaho and earn his keep in blue-collar jobs, got the hang of the local dialect in ""Nights"" by hanging with a crabber and generally melting into the neighborhood. The craggy-faced Glenn owns his scenes with Gere, not only through pitch-perfect dialect but also with an understated yet stinging ""nuts to you, you don't get it"" attitude. When Gere's character finally visits the widower's cottage, Glenn steals the camera lock, stock and barrel. There's an acting award here somewhere, at least in my book.

Cinematically, the only fault one might find with ""Nights"" comes at the end. Rather than close ""Nights"" with the spirited shots of Lane on the beach, mesmerized by a rare migration of the wild ponies that ordinarily confine themselves to the Virginia-Carolina border, the decision was made to tack on a wide shot of key characters peering out from a boardwalk - an unnecessary, even hackneyed action that drained some of the momentum from the film in its final moments.

""Nights in Rodanthe"" isn't rocket science, but it's pretty to look at, the acting is more than workmanlike, and everyone loves a love story, right? Four stars for the film, five for Scott Glenn's performance.",1231027200,39,2233,4.868421052631579

This film wouldn't be anything that someone who has not lived a bit could get into, but if you've felt the bite of betrayal or gotten lost in the sorrow of heartache... consider this one. A definite 'give it a try...' for the older and wiser crowd, Nights in Rodanthe is something to remind us of why we should ache for more and find peace with ourselves and the world, once we've found it.",1230681600,,715,4.296296296296297

There's a visible chemistry and that fact is evidently carved in relief in this touching film in which that love affair in that beautiful shore in North Caroline an unforgettable weekend. But the secondary lines reaffirms and nurtures the whole plot.

They meet up at a B & B on the ocean - and WOW - it was the most beautiful big house ever. I spent most of the movie looking at the furnishings, paint colors, and decor of this incredible house!
loved it madly!

Needless to say, the 2 lost, lonley, conveniently somewhat between relationships, attractive pair hit it off and have a whopping romance.

But, one time, she gets mad at his insensitivity and quickly he learns to be more compassionate. Quick learner!
