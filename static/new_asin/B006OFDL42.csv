5009161,5,B006OFDL42,"I thought the movie was fun and easy to get through. Sure, the acting is bad, along with the sound, editing, dubbing, and pretty much everything else, but the film has a certain charm to it that can't be ignored. I believe The Chill Factor achieves the ""so bad it's good"" title.

It's about a group of friends snowmobiling in the mountains. One of them gets in a nasty accident and they seek refuge in an abandoned summer camp. Turns out the abandoned camp was also home to a satanic cult. Naturally, the group discovers a Ouija board and unleashes a possessive, demonic spirit, which begins to pick off the group one by one.

I absolutely love horror movies with a Winter setting. Winter brings a sense of dread that can't be missed. It gives the film great atmosphere. The kills weren't overly gory, but they did the movie justice. The characters were also more fleshed out than most B-grade horror films. The final chase scene was a treat, but the very end of the film leaves a little to be desired.

Overall, I had a great time with it. It moves into slasher territory, which is great in my opinion. I'd say give it a watch with the lowest of expectations.",1377388800,3,1160,4.462264150943396
5009162,1,B006OFDL42,"I thought I had seen the worst of the worst D-Rated movies until I ran across this stinker, I just can't find a reason why anyone would have agreed to even make this steamer? How do they find so many bad actors to play in these things? The narration throughout the film just added to its irritating improvisation and adlibbing of some of the lines and to make it even worse, nothing happens for 43 minutes into the darn thing. There are tons of bad editing, mismatched musical scores, characters lips moving but dubbed out. A lot of simulated sex but no skin if anyone was wondering and of course a totally crap ending.",1355875200,2,619,4.43859649122807

8501859,4,B006OFDL42,"Three young couples are on a snowmobile holiday. They take a side trip to a place called Black Fire Lake in order for two of the guys to race. Tragedy ensues when one of them is seriously injured after crashing into a tree. He's battered and unconscious. Desperate for shelter, the group happens upon an old abandoned lodge in the middle of nowhere. As one might expect, this is no ordinary lodge! After settling in for the night, our heroes notice the religious artifacts everywhere. One of the guys decides to set out on his snowmobile to find help. While he's away, the rest of the group discovers a strange ""wheel of fortune"" game that's sort of like a Ouija board. They decide to play the game, and bizarre things start happening! The injured guy wakes up, while simultaneously, the guy who went for help meets w/ an unfortunate ""accident"". Apparently, these unwary travelers should have left that weird game alone! Further inspection reveals that the lodge was once a summer camp for children. It was run by a religious group that just happens to have been a satanic cult! More deadly ""accidents"" occur. Will anyone survive until morning? THE CHILL FACTOR is a slow-moving, supernatural horror movie w/ a few ghoulish set pieces. Though the characters are vapid, they aren't so absolutely annoying as to ruin everything. There are also some gruesome death scenes, including a death-by-icicle scene that's a gorehundt's delight! If you have a taste for the occult, then you might like this one...",1390780800,4,1501,4.844357976653696
