A legend of a boy who was known to cry all the time, a mystery and a climax to remind us things aren't always what they seem on the outside from rumors, stories and legends.  There are real people with real experiences often misunderstood behind them.  Lessons for life as well as entertainment.  Imagine if In The Light Entertainment had a huge budget for new productions what a refreshing change from all the negativity in so many movies today.  Positive, courageous, compelling to deal with negative life circumstances and turn them into positive (though fictional) adventure.  If we all had the guts to act do what was right, even when it's hard, we might make a positive difference in our society.  The leads were excellent and overall, the supporting actors were fair.  Reminds you of a time when we could go visit friends and have fun and adventure without too much danger of deviates praying on us.  Too bad our own children can't enjoy the same freedom in this place called America.  Let me know if there are any places like that left!",1137542400,2,1134,4.625

8029028,5,B0002M5T7K,When  I first watched this movie I was 7 or 8 and I loved it. It's sad but it has a lot of lessons for families and young kids as well.,1473638400,,135,3.3548387096774195
8029029,5,B0002M5T7K,"Okay, technically that's four words, but still, you get the idea. I bought this movie solely for Harold Smith's role. If you ever played the 1993 Infocom adventure game Return to Zork (PC), you'd know exactly who Smith is and his loveable legendary character, Boos Myller.

As far as this movie goes, it's about a young girl who hears the legend of Cryin' Ryan after tripping over his tombstone (from Smith) and shortly after, meets the spirit of Ryan himself. She spends the movie solving a mystery as to who Ryan's murderer actually was. The movie is innocent enough, and it's a great B movie to watch with your kids. I bought this recently, and had never seen it before. The actors were all locals from what I read with little-to-no acting experience. I can say this much: The actors were spot on for having no prior experience (with Smith being the exception). While not perfect, it's definitely better than I could do if just thrown in front of a camera.

I gave this movie 5 stars because it was far better than I anticipated it to be. The only gripe I have about this movie is that I wish it had a bigger budget. They did a phenomenal job given what they had to work with, but I could only imagine what this could have been, had they had a bit more to stretch. Pick this movie up. You won't be sorry, especially for the price!",1463270400,,1333,4.392712550607287

8029031,4,B0002M5T7K,liked the movie but made me angry that people turned away from a bad indentence and didn't help watch it to understand when kids are cryin' for help,1396137600,,148,4.321428571428571
8029032,5,B0002M5T7K,"the fiest time i saw this was 10 years ago and it made me cry about how the boy died of child abuse , so sad but i love it, one of my fave childhood movies would recomend to others",1278460800,2,180,3.525
8029033,5,B0002M5T7K,"What seems like it is just another kid's ghost story turns out to be a very important lesson on child physical abuse.  You see, Ryan was cryin' because he was beaten at home; it will come as no surprise, except to very young children, that Ryan's father accidentally killed him during one of his drunken beatings.  That is why his 'spirit' could not rest until his death was solved.  This movie has lots of good lessons that any traditional values family could support.  Chris sneaked out when she was supposed to be grounded . . . but she later confesses to her dad.  Chris also witnesses another young boy being abused, and, after learning the lessons Ryan taught her, she went to the authorities to report it so they could investigate it.

The most touching aspect of the movie was how Ryan tried to defend his dad; he was being punished because he saw the beatings as evidence of his dad's love for him because he was trying to make him go right.  Then, when he meets his father ghost (also deceased before he could be prosecuted) starting to shake Chris around, he realized that what his dad did was not love.  Still, he told his father that he forgave him for the beatings.  Chris couldn't believe her ears!  But what better example is there of the Lord's Pray - 'forgive us our trespasses as (in the same manner) we forgive those who trespass against us!'

One other scene that would be of interest to Christian families is when Chris asks her dad what happens when we die, he replies, 'To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.'  Of course, this is a children's movie.  But, it is one that parents can watch with their kids and enjoy it just as much as they do.  Also, it gives ample opportunity to discuss child abuse with one's children and to help them know when they need to report a friend's abuse.

Finally, I don't understand the first reviewer's attitude toward this movie.  Maybe he abuses his kids and it made him feel guilty.  I would argue that the vast majority of families looking for enjoyable movies for their kids that also teach valuable lessons and ethics, this is one they should seek out.",1176163200,11,2134,4.4728682170542635
8029034,1,B0002M5T7K,"I cannot believe how bad this movie is. My whole family could not take it. We made it through 60% of the movie before we could not take it any more. It is freaky how bad the acting is, not to mention the writing. Oh, and the sound sucks too. This is a must to see, ONLY because it is SO HORRIBLE. Warning, however, kids under 7 may find some scenes scarey - really. Good luck and may the force be with you.",1149724800,4,406,3.9036144578313254
