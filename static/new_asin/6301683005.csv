7815297,5,6301683005,"Hosted by Bob Costas and Mickey Mantle, this video presents the 14 men (through 1989) who had hit 500 career home runs.  Mantle and Costas talk about the old days, the players of long ago, and analyze the factors and variables that both helped and hindered players' quests toward reaching 500 career home runs.  There are a couple of factual errors in this video (one of them is when Costas said that Ted Williams won the Triple Crown in 1941, when in fact he did not win the RBI title that year).  You'll see old footage of the 14 players in the club, some of their statistics, some of their historic 500th and 600th home runs, and more.  Costas and Mantle share interesting stories about these players and the eras in which they played.  Though dated (it came out in 1989), I still like watching this video.

In the 20 years since this video was made, many more players have joined the 500 home run club.  A lot of these players have clouds hanging over their heads because of suspected use of steroids and HGH (human growth hormone).  I like watching this video because it shows the players of yesteryear (who were never suspected of using performance enhancing drugs) who hit 500 or more home runs.  Years ago it was much tougher for a player to reach 500 career homers because performance enhancing drugs didn't exist, ballparks generally were larger, and up until the early 1960s there was a 154 game season, not to mention the fact that some players who played in the early 20th century started their careers in the Dead Ball Era, which ended around 1920.  Babe Ruth is an example of a player who began his career (as a pitcher) in the Dead Ball Era for the first 5 years of his career.  Being a pitcher, he didn't get to play every day, though he did eventually start to play the outfield on days when he wasn't pitching.  Despite hitting an estimated 50 ""home runs"" that were ruled foul balls by the old foul pole rule that stood until 1931 (where if a ball hooked inside the foul pole and landed in the stands in foul territory despite crossing the plane of the fence in fair territory it was ruled a foul ball), he did hit 714 career homers.  Add those 50 homers and he'd have 764, two more than Barry Bonds.

If you're nostalgic and ""old school"" when it comes to baseball, you owe it to yourself to see this video (if possible).  Highly recommended.",1251331200,3,2361,4.4581395348837205
