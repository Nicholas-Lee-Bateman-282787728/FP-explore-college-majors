1222868,5,B00000ILG0,"Sir David is his usual charming self in this beautifully made documentary. I can't see there ever being a better video series about birds, this truly is the penultimate expression of Attenborough's love of nature. The  cinematography is top-notch and there are no boring segments to be found.  If you are at all interested in birds, whether casually or professionally,  you owe it to yourself to watch these videos.",945734400,18,415,4.9855072463768115
1222869,5,B00000ILG0,My husband and I found ourselves drawn into the sights and sounds of the Life of Birds each week.  Our only regret was we did not catch all the episodes so we bought the tapes as a gift for our parents which we intend  to borrow!  The photography is top notch and the information reveals a side  of our feathered friends we never appreciated before.  You will never look  at birds the same way again!,943228800,5,400,4.266666666666667
1222870,5,B00000ILG0,"I have been watching this series on my local PBS station, and it's become the absolute highlight of my week.  Attenborough himself is avuncular, charming and witty, as well as incredibly knowledgeable.  His camera crew  go to extreme lengths to ensure top-notch photography.

1222882,4,B00000ILG0,Good documentary. However it would be nice to have some that don't require quite such coverage on the reproductive habits of birds. Not that it's not important but it would be nice to have something to show kids that we can truly relax with.,1494892800,,241,4.5

1222945,5,B00000ILG0,"Wow wow!  This is a high-water mark in nature photography, the camera operators must have worked double triple overtime to get these intimate scenes of birds being birds. The info presented in narration is always engaging and interesting.  And the presenter, David Attenborough, is Mother Nature's son--no passive script reader, Attenborough gets into these birds' heads and explains what is going on in their birdy brains. This is a wonderful program, had me hollering ""WOW WoW!"" at thee TV :-)",1429747200,3,495,5.175
1222946,5,B00000ILG0,"The flow of the narration is wonderful, helps to commit oneself to 10 hours' of viewing time (on 3 DVDs.) Very good editing and music too. It's true that the visual quality may not be the greatest. But I watched some of this on a small screen, such as my computer monitor, and wasn't bothered that much.

This storyiline includes references to the evolution of birds, including the first flying reptile birds millions of years ago. Creationists might have trouble with that scenario. But I'd recommend putting such stuff into a minor place in the whole bird picture.

You'll discover insights into how birds began flying and achieved mastery, except for those who didn't fly! Then there are episodes on meat-eaters, fishers, signals and songs, mating and reproducing. Most intriguing is how they've gone all out to protect their eggs--rivaling pottery, carpentry, weaving, camoflage and deception. The episode on ""Limits of Endurance"" helps us to sympathize with their battles for survival throughout their history, but especially in today's world.

Overall this is a magnificent production and I recommnend it for your home library. It's not a one-time viewing type of DVD set.",1428969600,,1178,5.125

1222950,5,B00000ILG0,"We viewed this on VHS years ago and bought the DVD to see this outstanding production from David Attenborough and BBC again.  Attenborough's enthusiastic and knowledgeable narrative is pleasant to listen to and simply fun, as always.  Suggest buying Birds of the Gods to go with it.  The photography is exceptional.

1222969,5,B00000ILG0,"this is a documentary that all should have as part of their home library. David created an exciting adventure about life with birds that I never knew existed. How they lived, what they did to maintain the importance of deciding on a life long mate, becoming a parent and one that did not leave home. How did these birds inherit the ability to maintain this knowledge and keep it from evolving into something extremely different. Life as we humans know it is in many ways quite similar however we too remain the same. I hope many will seek this video as yes it is different reading this in a book but the advantage of the visual places layers of knowledge that most likely we would not envision. This DVD is extraordinary in every way. Congratulation to all who participated in creating this story. P. J. Today",1419033600,,809,4.5479452054794525

Then why lower rating, because of a disc quality issue; the complete DVD set developed transparent patches and became unusable with in few years.(I am writing this review several years after purchase). The current stock may be good but none of the BBC DVDs I purchased from UK site had a single problem.
Apart from that, you notice grainy nature of the transfer in the series most probably due to aging of the original work.

1223031,5,B00000ILG0,"once again, David Attenborough takes us to places on the earth-- where I might never travel--to view these magnificent creatures.  If you love birds, grab this film.  You'll love it!  And return to it time and time again to remind yourself just how incredible Mother Nature truly is.  Worth every penny!",1403913600,,303,4.882352941176471
1223032,5,B00000ILG0,"Very well organized and diverse.  The video doesn't attempt to cover all birds but uses a variety to demonstrate aspects of bird life, such as evolution, flight, mating and so forth.",1402617600,,182,4.870967741935484
1223033,5,B00000ILG0,"This series is from 1998, and the DVD was released in 2002.  I saw it when it first came out, and it is still as alive and thrilling as ever.  This is a series you could pick up and watch whenever you are feeling sad, and it will lift you up.  David Attenborough's love and knowledge of these creatures shines through in every moment.  And thankfully it is not a ""greenie / preachy"" approach to the subject.  Even the most ardent bird lover will find something new and interesting in every episode.
This, in my opinion, is one of the best nature series ever produced, right up there with Blue Planet, etc.  If you have not seen this, do not miss it.",1402617600,,649,4.278688524590164
1223034,3,B00000ILG0,"I liked it but there's too much dinosaur nonsense involved....It should be just all about birds.

1223035,5,B00000ILG0,We randomly selected this BBC series to watch and were blown away by the photography. The filming of the diving birds where the camera angle is below the surface of the water thereby showing the instant the bird dives in to grab the fish was extraordinary!  We highly recommend this series to all who appreciate the amazing diversity of bird species around the world.,1401753600,,367,4.734375

1223064,5,B00000ILG0,"I watched these 3 DVDs while on the treadmill (took several different days), and was amazed at the quantity of things I had no clue to when it came to birds.  Did you know that there is a bird that can mimic a chainsaw, a car alarm and a camera shutter clicking...and do it so well that if you were lost in the jungle near this bird you would think there were people near by? ...and this is NOT a parrot.

Many more fascinating things to see in this documentary!",1392422400,,462,4.122222222222222

1223073,5,B00000ILG0,"My daughter is doing a science course exclusively on birds this year. We have been watching, ""The Life of Birds,"" and have learned so much about them. One could never get this close to birds and see how they truly live in their own environment. Many of the birds highlighted do not reside in our state, but are worth finding out more about. Even if it has nothing to do with school, this is a must-see program for anyone who is a bird watcher or simply wants to learn more about them. We have not finished viewing this series, but have discussed starting from the beginning and watching them once again. The gentleman who narrates this program has a slight accent, so we pulled up the captions on-screen to make sure we could understand all that he was saying. This in no way takes away from the program and being able to pause and discuss in-between has been helpful. Take the time out of your busy day and learn more about the world of birds, you'll be glad you did!",1387497600,,968,4.383333333333334

1223075,3,B00000ILG0,"Besides Planet Earth and the Blue Planet, this is one of best segments of specific group of species that David Attenborough does a great job covering.  I love science presented this way.  I wish this was shown more in schools today.  It is a wake up call for those who don't want to believe in the fragileness of those on this spaceship earth.",1385856000,,343,4.412698412698413
1223076,5,B00000ILG0,"If ever you think--nah, no living creature would do THAT!--just take a look at the diversity of organisms on earth.

1223077,5,B00000ILG0,Outstanding documentary of the life of birds. I bought it to give away as a gift as I already owned it. I watch it often to unwind from stress at work. David Attenborough is a great storyteller. Masterfully done.,1385078400,,212,4.461538461538462
1223078,5,B00000ILG0,"Amazingly narrated, beautiful and unique images, and relevant information. It really gave me a different perspective on birds and their way of life, it being so different from our own and other animals as well.",1382745600,,210,5.0285714285714285

1223080,5,B00000ILG0,"Fascinating movie. As fast as David Attenboro talks the movie doesn't run too fast. The pauses and attention to each bird is at once stimulating and calming. Nice editing. Amazing, graceful creatures. Early birds, flightless birds, giant birds!",1380067200,,244,5.447368421052632

1223094,5,B00000ILG0,I've seen a lot of David Attenborough's work and it's all incredible.  He never stoops to anthropomorphizing but explains the challenges of surviving from each species' unique perspective.  Anyone who thinks science and nature are not magical in the way that they find supernatural explanations to be needs to spend more time looking at the world through David Attenborough's eyes.,1376179200,,381,5.333333333333333

1223099,5,B00000ILG0,"Attenborough does a wonderful job taking us to the ends of the earth, and into our backyard, sharing bird behavior with us.  The content is incredible and we learned so much the first time we watched the entire series from the library.  Our only complaint as we've been watching again is the video quality over streaming.",1371945600,,321,4.714285714285714

1223101,4,B00000ILG0,"David Attenborough as always is amazing as well as BBC. They always succeed when it comes to documentaries. I am very pleased with this purchase. I gave it 4 stars because as others have said it is fairly grainy in parts; if it comes out on blu-ray I will probably purchase that copy for the better quality image, but otherwise outstanding cinematography and incredible information that will leave you amazed at the variation of birds on the planet.",1370304000,,449,4.769230769230769

1223105,5,B00000ILG0,"If Sir David Attenborough did a show about dirt, and the 10 minute DVD was selling for 49.99, I'd buy 2 - just in case. If you have never watched any of his documentaries, you have sorely cheated yourself. His style and enthusiasm have a way of drawing the viewer in, and you suddenly find yourself in awe of things you didn't think you even cared about. If you have kids, his BBC specials will bring to life the real world; the one beyond social networks and 'smart' phones. If this is your first time watching David Attenborough, make sure you put 'Planet Earth' on your list of 'not to be missed' DVDs. And while you're at it, look into the life of the man himself. He's been travelling the world since the 50's, and you know it when you're watching him handle any subject. PS: He and Richard Attenborough (Jurassic Park) are brothers. Watch this show, you won't be disappointed.",1368489600,,882,4.484472049689441

1223108,5,B00000ILG0,I've read the book and see the movie.  Both are most enjoyable.  Lots of pictures in the book.  Rare in a movie to see such close-ups of so many rare birds!!!,1364774400,,158,4.032258064516129
1223109,5,B00000ILG0,"...fascinating documentary by David Attenbrough. Everything he does is superb. Life of Birds is no exception.

Each episode is a masterpiece in itself, but there is a sequence, so it's best watch them all, and in order.  You don't have to like birds to like this program.  What ever your feeling about birds, David Atttenborough will probably convince you that they are, if nothing else,  fascinating.",1364515200,,401,5.03030303030303
1223110,5,B00000ILG0,This series is wonderful.  Excellent footage that makes you really see what the birds are all about.  Very nicely done!,1364169600,,119,4.9
1223111,5,B00000ILG0,"We have swatched it in snippets with our 4 and 6 yr olds, just before they go to bed.  While there are a few graphic sequences, they are not overt or scary. Attenborough and his team always seem to do a fine job and in this case, really from all over the globe.  Production values are excellent, and the camera work is very fine. Attenborough makes regular appearances in situ, but not overly so, and usually close up with the subjects.  Highly recommended.  We now have cued up his ""Greatest Wildlife Show on Earth"" for our next viewing.",1363219200,,538,4.459183673469388

1223113,5,B00000ILG0,"This is a great series. The image quality is really impressive on my 38"" tv streaming via Roku and for what I assume is before HD cameras.

It's great as a companion to other activities; I've been doing crafts while listening to his narration, then I'll pause and watch when it sounds like there will be impressive video.

Love all the different types of birds around the world, breaking them down into flying/flightless, meat-eating/herbavores/fishing, and even bringing in their dinosaur ancestors during the episode on feathers.

Great for anyone who enjoys documentaries, wants to learn more about birds, or just finds birds fascinating.",1362441600,,641,5.203883495145631
1223124,5,B00000ILG0,"I love Sir David, and this was the second-to-last dvd I had to get before my collection was complete! I started watching it right away. I get such a kick out of seeing David wandering around with all the birds and exploring. Every time I've put in the DVD my roommates start congregating because it's so interesting.

It's definitely an older series, Life and Planet Earth was spectacular because of the crispness of the images in addition to the content. This series is older, so keep in mind it was great quality for that time. The content is just as good.",1362009600,,558,4.524752475247524
1223125,5,B00000ILG0,This is a pretty amazing series. While of great interest to bird-watchers and people who enjoy the natural world - it's photography is compelling enough to keep even the casual viewer engaged - and learning something at the same time.,1361836800,,234,4.875

But I can't seem to watch a single video from Amazon's servers without frequent pauses, garbled/distorted playback and below average video quality. It's hard to appreciate these regal creatures when you can't tell their beaks from the sky, their feathers from the water, etc.

Poor streaming results in poorer video quality, and frequent pauses to retain more of the stream for playback. I don't know what the problem is: Amazon's video window shows excellent connection/bandwidth between my computer and their servers, and my internet connection is a whopping 50mb+.

I was unable to record the entire series, so I have always wanted to see it in its entirety.  Since I love birds, this was a real treat for me to watch all of the programs on three DVDs.  It is really a remarkable series, especially when you consider to what extent the producers went to film in unusual and often remote locations.  The slow motion photography showing how birds fly is nothing short of amazing!  Considering that this series was filmed several years ago, I was impressed with the color, clarity,and sound of the DVD set.

It's grainy, and the colors aren't nearly as vivid as we're now used to.

Once you get past that--it takes about 20 minutes to revert to pre-2005 video eyes--you are in for a glorious treat.

Some of the most wonderful segments from all the Attenborough series are concentrated here.  The beauty of birds is brought across in thematically-grouped disks (fishing, finding partners, etc).  Some bits are far more beautifully narrated and edited than any human documentary, especially the ones on the Lyre Bird and the Bowerbird.  The segments are funny, moving, and surprising.

Final note: sometimes other BBC nature documentaries can get me down--they are often ruthless about showing death and telling sad stories.  ""The Life of Birds"" has far fewer such moments per segment.  It's a genuine relief to just get to revel and be awed.  And the birds furnish plenty of material for both.",1285804800,7,1102,4.783068783068783

However, any video with David Attenborough is worth the investment, his intrigued and enlightened tone elevates the documentaries beyond downfalls in video quality. For those that love birds, or like being intrigued by the exotic stories of nature this series is a must. If your a collector of Attenborough this is yet another great series. But if you love documentaries because you like hour and hours of stunning photography,this is not at the same quality as other series. Life in the Undergrowth and the Life of Mammals I would recommend if your a discerning videophile.

I deducted one star simply because the quality of the picture was not great.  I know that this was produced a while ago, and that is probably why.  I had grown accustomed to ""Planet Earth"" and it's spectacular picture.  I put this dvd into my computer with its new monitor just to make sure it wasn't my old tv that was the problem, and even there everything looked a little dull, fuzzy, and grainy.  Oh well, I guess that's just the way progress goes!  It sure does make it obvious when something was filmed a few years back.

The picture quality is mediocre at best and doesn't show the great photography which made the  original programs so appealing.  The discs were very difficult to remove from the case, and you have to be careful not to damage them when taking them out.  One of the hubs which held the DVD's in place broke off after the set was played only a few times.  I wonder why a better DVD set of this series wasn't made for our region.  This is not an expensive set if you can get it at a reduced price, but one wonders if it is really worth the money when other nature documentaries which are just as good have been released on better material.  If you like David Attenborough and want to see one of his best documentaries featuring birds you will want to own this set, but you might be very disappointed in its quality.",1266969600,6,873,4.286585365853658

of problem with the subject matter: yes , everything is true but it is very sad
and bleak survival of the birds;  no artistic effor of making the birds look interesting,
beautiful or exotic, no chapter of birds singing  or diference of voices in general
which could be quite exciting topic to cover. No beutiful music in it as well..
It is too scientifically coldly made no passion or effors has been made to invision
 the birds with admiration and amusement: no hint of beauty in the birds or lyrical
attemt to show how special birds are,it is  very cold even very true
observaton. I do not want sugar coated series as well but have a little bit poetry
will help.  I saw preview of different series and seeems to me all have the same
attitude : the series are about hardship but the real life has everything ,
they try to make you scare as auction film which I try to avoid most of the time.
I am sure that it  is not only hardship in life but a beauty and music and art of seeing it..
Here is  everything so intense and sad... even scary. It is  very plain reflection of the life
of birds.
 Where is the joy in the birds life?  I am sure that we do not look at the  birds
 with  very narrow cold analitical  eyes  but  we enjoy the birds songs,
 admire their beauty and grace and colors  as fabulous variety :
I think the producer should to find differnt appoach to this series.
I liked he series but it is too simplistic...

Some of the topics include finding a mate, building nests and rearing young, to various bird calls/sounds, and the challenges birds face living in extreme environments are just some of the topics discussed.

What is captured on film for us to view about the various birds around the world is quite amazing and fun to watch. I enjoyed learning a lot of new and interesting things about birds I never knew before.",1239148800,,669,4.911504424778761

From the beginning, it is fascinating with both extraordinary graphics and amazing insight as to the life of birds. Even though it comes on multiple disks, you will be left wanting for more.  Naturally, one of the mod important elements in this production is David Attenborough with his intriguing presentation stile and pacing.

The only downside is that this documentary suffers from ""yum yum eate'm up syndrome.""  The depiction of something being eaten is proportionally over emphasized; this distracts from the rest of the film.

1223178,5,B00000ILG0,"This is the 6th entry in the David Attenborough Life series following The Private Lives of Plants. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic. The Private life of Plants was another 6 episode series and focused entirely on botany.

With Life in the Freezer and The Private Life of Plants Attenborough made a new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos, Attenborough now decides to detach from the shorter episode format of Freezer and Plants (an such as was in previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives) and goes for a higher number of 10 instead of 6 instalments on another expert theme. Attenborough concentrates on one animal kingdom, the birds, and it's a real wildlife bonanza with many moments to leave you speechless.

While The Private Life of Plants was a somewhat still, though time-lapsed voyage, because they don't move very far very quickly, the Life of Birds is on the opposite end of the spectrum with birds darting around frequently to the point where slow motion is needed to see what just happened for the `blink and you miss it' moments. In this series Attenborough maybe visits more places and countries than all his series put together. Some of it though was covered before in Life on Earth, but you still want to see it again. Since birds do a lot of singing sound is of primary importance as much as the visuals, maybe even more so. This show literally turns your living room into a nature park with its superb audio. There are some sequences involving domesticated birds that have been imprinted and they can perform on cue, so you get some amazing shots, like birds flying with the camera. There is some CGI done for birds that are now extinct.

Major themes include when to fly and when not to fly, the mechanisms of flying, finding food, meat eating birds, fishing, bird signalling, finding mates, egg laying, parental care and endurance.

Overall it's an amazing production. Attenborough though is now 72 years of age and while he even appears swimming in some sequences, this is the series where his years are starting to show but its more than obvious that this isn't stopping him, not one little bit. The investigation and observations of birds is nothing short of stunning. This series also has one of Attenborough's greatest moments.  The Lyrebird that can mimic cameras, a car alarm and a chain saw. The final episode includes human intervention including some conservation efforts that are nothing short of gobsmacking. Attenborough rounds off by making a final call for bird preservation. Ornithology has never been so well documented.",1233187200,2,3257,4.893115942028985

Now, my only bad remark about the series.  The DVD video quality.  It is VHS at best, and looks like a Divx hack of some movie... not that I would know what one would look like.

1223241,5,B00000ILG0,"My wife and I have a long and strong interest in birds, with two pet sparrows, other close bird associations, and hundreds of hours soaring with raptors, ravens, swifts, gulls, and pelicans, on our hang gliders and paragliders. Birds have been the main focus of Naomi's artwork. So we expected to enjoy the series but maybe not find a lot of new or surprising information. Wrong! Most of the content so far has been new to us, either species we had never heard of or at least a different angle on the ones we did know something about. After renting and watching half of the first DVD, we ordered the whole set. This will be one of the few that we will watch, and show to friends, over and over.

I can't speak directly for people who think they have no interest in birds, but that should be no deterrent. If you have any interest in the world around you, watch this video.

  The videography is breathtaking; narration is great; pacing, story interest, and organization are nearly flawless. Factual, technical, or editing errors are few and trivial. As someone with a long interest and a lot of knowledge in aviation and aerodynamics, I can say that this program gets it right and gets it across in ways that intelligent lay people will grasp in ways that will give them a whole new way of seeing the world around them. I can only assume that the same level of care has been given to less familiar sub-topics. Getting specialized knowledge across to lay audiences without dumbing it down or losing accuracy is a rare and precious art: The Life of Birds is a masterpiece. Attenborough is a charming guide, fun to watch and hear, and not too intrusive. Occasional computer graphics and animations serve a good purpose and are not overdone. There's little or no annoying overdramatization - who needs that when the material is so engrossing and compelling on its own?

  If video transfer quality on earlier DVDs or tapes was poor, that problem seems to have been solved. What we've seen is some of the most sparklingly clear video I can think of anywhere. About the only small gripe I have is that the menu navigation and links from one chapter to another are awkward and confusing. But that amounts to a minute or two of annoyance out of hours of pleasure.

  One reviewer mentioned missing topics such as bird respiration. Well, it would be nice to cover everything known about birds, but even in 10 hours of video it simply can't be done. And some topics are probably a better fit for books, such as The Sibley Guide to Bird Life & Behavior.

I have not gone birdwatching in about 10 years; after viewing this, I have not only resumed birdwatching, but I have a more intuitive way of looking at & appreciating the birds, which has helped me identify birds more quickly and accurately.

  David Attenborough seems to revere the wildlife with such a refreshing perspective--as if, despite all his expertise, he is still able to wonder at each action of each creature, and truly enjoy the small wonders of the world.

1223263,4,B00000ILG0,"This is my first of many reviews of David Attenborough's fantastic wildlife documentaries. After checking out ""The Living Planet"" from the library I quickly found out more about his work, and this was the first I came across. Seeing as how, long before I watched this I already had an enormous interest in wildlife, I was very pleased to learn loads of new facts (a common occurrence in Attenborough's programs) and even find out about species I had never heard of before!

Some examples of this (for me anyway) were the Takahe, Kakapo and the extinct Moa (recreated with CGI, which is used for some other scenes too). Even species I was very familiar with, such as the Toco Toucan would exhibit behavior that was completely new to me. In one scene two Toco Toucans rob eggs from a tube-like nest with their amazingly long beaks, and I had always thought they were strict fruit-eaters! This series is just jam-packed with fascinating scenes like that. And, of course, I am still familiar with much of what is being presented, but that does not take anything away from the viewing experience at all. (if it did, what would be the point of repeat viewings?)

A plus to all this, is the presentation, the cinematography is incredible. (eagles flying towards the camera through trees, a king-fisher diving to catch a fish viewed from under-water) And of course David's narration and on-screen presenting is very engaging, he's very enthusiastic about the material he's delivering.

On another note, the music is great and really fits well with the programs, and I often find myself whistling the theme after watching it.

There really is only one small complaint, which is the same as many others, that being the video transfer. It's not as good as others in the ""Life of"" series but it is not too bad and you easily forget about it once you've started watching it (due to how good the series is). Most scenes still look very clear and sharp. Only occasionally does the picture get really fuzzy. Also, this is a widescreen program, and to be presented in fullscreen (coupled with a less than stellar transfer) is what made this miss the 5 star mark. This is truly a masterpiece of a documentary, so to see it not given the very best DVD presentation possible is a real shame.

Still, this is definitely a great addition to anyone's video library, and I highly recommend it!",1156636800,3,2369,4.71256038647343

The only suggestion I offer, is to make sure you view this on the best ""State of the Art"" TV that you can afford (or borrow) and you WILL experience a visual experience like none other.

It is a 3 disk set and it is about 3 hours of viewing of each disk. If you become affected (mesmerized) as I had been, you would probably want to keep this particular DVD set in a ""safedeposit box"", so that you can add an amendment to your ""Will"", bequeathing this particular DVD set to those that loved you the most.

They may forget about you, but they will never forget the visual experience you have left them.

May you have an long life and as long as you live and re-play this DVD set,your life will only be embellished.

1223265,4,B00000ILG0,"David Attenborough simply makes the best nature documentaries available today.  His style is thorough, witty, knowledgeable and avuncular; watching his work one feels as if one is being gently instructed by a kindly and brilliant long lost relative, eager to impart his understanding of and wonder with the world to those who will follow him.

The Life of Birds is a truly excellent series, with extremely high production values, solid editing and a wide array of obscure trivia and arcana to interest the veteran avian enthusiast as much as the neophyte naturalist.

I have never personally had any particular affinity to or affection for birds before viewing this series; I honestly picked it up to have more Attenborough to enjoy after burning through The Life of Mammals and The Blue Planet over the course of a few weeks.  Despite my initial disinclination for the subject matter, I found the documentaries to be exceedingly engaging, so much so that within weeks I found myself and my somewhat surprised S.O. hiking around a nearby nature reserve searching for various indigenous species of marsh birds.

However, the subject matter, however fascinating, is tested to it's limits of interest by the sheer size of the series.  I hesitate to accuse Attenborough, but I feel that the subject matter could frankly have been handled in less episodes than are present in the series, or perhaps in shorter episodes.  Upon reflection, however, I cannot think of any extraneous episodes or segments; rather, after the huge diversities of species covered in the tantalizing Life of Mammals and Blue Planet, I suspect the focus on the more subtly diverse avian kingdom was simply too narrow for my wandering and fickle tastes.

In all, however, The Life of Birds is truly an excellent series, and I would recommend it unhesitatingly to anyone interested in increasing their own knowledge of the manifold wonders nature.  While I have no real personal sense of what is or is not appropriate viewing for young children, one of my co-workers to whom I have lent several of the discs of the series tells me that his two pre-teen daughters enjoy the series very much.

I would, however, suggest to those without experience of Attenborough's works that they begin with The Life of Mammals, probably my favorite of all his series.",1142553600,13,2318,4.981865284974093

1223288,5,B00000ILG0,"Having watched several bird videos lately (the dramatic documentaries March of the Penguins, Winged Migration, and Pale Male, as well as the fictionalized Fly Away Home), and having recently become aware of the variety of birds in our neighborhood, I finally got around to watching David Attenborough's excellent Life of Birds. As entertaining as all the other videos were, Life of Birds is by far the best of the flock.

As you begin to watch the series, it isn't long before you appreciate the amazing camera work, as well as the amount of patience involved in waiting for just the right shot. And with the amount of film that was shot, editing must have been a monumental chore as well. But what an incredible result. You get so close to the birds, and observe so intimately their behavior, that you may begin to grow pinfeathers.

I had never seen David Attenborough before watching Life of the Birds, though I was aware of his reputation. For the first episode or two, I thought he was a bit quirky, bouncing around as he talked, wearing funny hats in cold weather, popping up in every corner of the earth to catch birds in their native habitats. His enthusiasm is infectious, and it's fun to see him occasionally interacting with the birds - in one scene he actually helps steady a bird who loses its footing while running up a tree. He lounges among huge flocks of birds and the birds walk up to him as if to say ""No need to worry, it's only David Attenborough."" But Attenborough would not approve of anthropomorphizing the birds. He knows his science, and by the end of the ten-part series, you will too.

There are no extras on this three-disc set. However, in one of the later episodes there is a short section about the filming of the series. One cameraman spends all night in a precarious treehouse so that he can film his subjects at sunrise. There is a storm and lightning breaks off one of the brances of the tree the camerman is perched in, but fortunately not the critical branch. The shots he got in the morning were spectacular.",1135555200,10,2047,4.587431693989071

1223295,5,B00000ILG0,"Even though there were some things I thought were missed, and even though there was something in every program that mildly annoyed me.  With nothing really comparable, I still believe this is worth the top rating, simply because of the labor of love David Attenborough put into it.

What were those things I didn't like?  In ""Life of Birds"", with 5 minutes to go in every program, David would introduce the next program, but then would resume with the current program.  This, to me, breaks the rhythm of the narrative and is not consistent with the style used in ""Life of Mammals"", where he would introduce the next program only at the very end of the current program.  Maybe this difference in style also reflects the difference in time the two were created, ""Life of Birds"" seems to have been made much earlier, and it even shows in the inferior quality of some of the footage used.  Each program in ""Birds"" also lasts 53 minutes, while those of ""Mammals"" last only 48.  Those extra five minutes...

I also think there was not enough attention given to other crucial parts of birds' anatomy, like the unique respiratory system that allows them to cope with the oxygen demands of flight.  Even the differences in ""white muscle"" of quail and red muscle of doves, for example, were not touched, and these would have given insight to why some birds are natural strong flyers while some are limited to short burts and spend their time mostly on the ground.  Differences in talons and beaks, differences in wing shapes, IMO could have been better illustrated.

And in both ""Birds"" and ""Mammals"" I really can't understand why David Attenborough would go great lengths to show the rarest of species while ignoring the obvious: chickens, dogs, cats, cows and horses.  Just because these animals are domesticated and common in the backyard doesn't mean they're not interesting.

And yeah, house cats are among the most destructive of bird predators.  Maybe that's one reason for not showing house cats.",1104278400,17,1994,4.826470588235294

Even if you are an avid birder, you are sure to discover new species, new habitats, and new facts about bird behaviors that you weren't aware of before. One of the most rewarding things about these stories are that you may find yourself wondering out-loud, ""How did they find out about that???"" over-and-over, as we did, to find that they actually take the time to answer those questions at the end of the episode.

1223308,5,B00000ILG0,"My wife and I bought The Life of Birds from Amazon without seeing a minute of it.  We had seen The Life of Mammals and Blue Planet enough times that we both felt confident that we knew what we were getting.  We were right.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I can't quite say it was as good as Blue Planet, which blew me away.
Based on our previous experience with The Life of Mammals and Blue Planet, what were we expecting, you might ask?  Well, first of all, we knew we'd be getting an outstanding nature documentary series featuring a dizzying variety of animals.  We were also expecting informative, yet not overly intrusive narration from David Attenborough.  Last, we were expecting a series that our 2-year-old would be riveted to and want to watch over and over again, which is what happened with the first two series.  As I said earlier, that's what we expected and that's what we got.
Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Winged Migration.  But as far as documentaries go, it really is a different bird (if you will).  The Life of Birds is engaging in a way that Winged Migration is not - it strives to teach, not to create art.  The footage may not inspire quite so many ""How did they get that shot?"" moments as Winged Migration, but there are plenty of scenes that make you wonder.  Add to that the fact that there are so many bird species from all manner of habitat in this series that you'll lose count after the first installment.
The 3-disc set consists of 10 episodes:
TO FLY OR NOT TO FLY:  Features computer animated sequences on the origins of flight and how birds evolved from pterasaurs - very similar to that in Walking With Dinosaurs.  Also great footage of birds hunting insects, including a bee eaters, kiwis, and a hornbill.
THE MASTERY OF  FLIGHT: An in-depth look at the anatomy of flight featuring albatrosses, pelicans, hummingbirds, snow geese and various birds of prey.  There's a great scene where an osprey nabs a trout, picks it up and turns it head first in mid-flight to reduce drag.
THE INSATIABLE APPETITE:  Deals with the constant search for food, largely as a result of flying being so energy-intensive.  Features woodpeckers, sap suckers, geese, lorikeets, hornbills, crows, robins and macaws.
MEAT EATERS:  Deals almost exclusively with birds of prey, such as owls, eagles, kestrels, shrikes, and hawks, as well as a few that you wouldn't expect (vultures and flamingos).  Amazing flight footage in this episode, and very much feels the same as those documentaries of lions eating zebras in Africa.
FISHING FOR A LIVING:  Pretty self-explanatory title, featuring dippers, ducks, skimmers, kingfishers, gulls, cormorants, herons, cranes, albatrosses and assorted shore birds.
SIGNALS AND SONGS:  A detailed analysis of the reasons and ways that birds communicate.  Features robins, blackbirds, finches, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, bell birds, toucans and a whole bunch of birds whose names I'd be sure to misspell if I tried.
FINDING PARTNERS:  You can't talk about mating birds without talking about peacocks, right?  Well, they did.  However, there are grebes, Jamaican streamer-tailed hummingbirds, red-headed weavers, an odd-looking pheasant, a Scottish grouse, the calf bird (which moos to attract a mate) and hedge sparrows.
THE DEMANDS OF THE EGG:  Looks at the hassles birds go through to protect their eggs, including a close look at nesting.  Features terns, dippers, frigate birds, warblers, weaver birds, red-breasted toucan,  cuckoos, and imperial pigeons.
THE PROBLEMS OF PARENTHOOD:  Deals with the non-stop effort of feeding some demanding kids that bird parents seem to go through.  The young bird footage is great.  Features Australian Rosella parrots, coots, cuckoos, Andean torrent ducks, red geese, Arabian babblers, and open billed storks.
THE LIMITS OF ENDURANCE:  Examines birds living in hostile environments, and co-existing with people.  Also handles conservation efforts, as well as a brief recap of birds that have gone extinct in the last hundred years or so.  Features penguins, sand grouse, crab plovers, Arctic gulls, vultures, crows in Japan (some amazing urban footage here), purple martens, and a host of endangered birds.",1089331200,244,4221,5.043290043290043

1223310,5,B00000ILG0,"David Attenborough's series, The Life of Birds, is quite simply the best documentary wildlife program I have ever seen. First, hats off to the photographers who spent countless hours patiently waiting for that one moment when, for example, a hawk plummets from the sky to capture its prey on the ground. We watch in wonder as this magnificent bird folds its wings and falls at speeds of 200 mph and more to the ground to stike and then lift quickly the unsuspecting animal in its talons. On the other end of the spectrum we observe a hummingbird remaining still in the air while its wings are beating a hundred times a second as it delicately licks nectar from a flower. Before television we have never had a chance to see these wonders so closely and so immediately. These great photographers reveal the mysteries of nature hidden from all but a very few naturalists.

David Attenborough is our guide in this wonderland and he treats us like a friend along for a walk in the woods or the frozen tundra of the North Pole, as well as the rest of the planet that he has wandered in his search for undiscovered truths about the habits of birds. Attenborough takes great risks on our behalf. With line and pulley he ascends to the tops of trees in the Amazon rain forest or the eagles nest high in the rocky mountains.

Not a moment is wasted. Each minute of every program is filled with sights and sounds, facts and figures, and thoughtful commentary about the life of birds. We think of ourselves as the masterbuilders of planet earth until we see the weaver birds using spiders' silk to sew a nest using the leaves of trees and thatch carefully gathered to make a home for the eggs that hatch into young as carefully tended as a mother tends her child.

Our DVD player gives us options no naturalist ever had. We are able to slow down and freeze frame extraordinary sights and study them carefully before we move on. Here is an education no book can match or field study replicate. When the last program ends we have the satisfaction of knowing that the whole show is available to us again and again to view at our leisure.

Great is the only word to describe The Life of Birds and first-time viewers will be delighted by all they see and hear. This is a program for everyone and a great investment for any home library.",1078531200,,2319,4.488151658767772

Beyond the rather grainy/fuzzy look to a lot of the episodes, this is David Attenborough's opus to his favorite animals, the birds.  Well, I can't be sure they are his favorite animals, but it would seem that way from his treatment of them in this and several of the other 'Life' series.
OK, perhaps a second complaint might be that we've seen a little of this before with 'Trials of Life', but unlike 'Life of Mammals' that alternatively feels too recycled or stretching too hard to find the weirdest thing we've never seen (IE the Golden Mole), 'Birds' gets right down to its lessons in Ornithology.
Not that it's anywhere near as brainy as Life on Earth--I'm pretty sure nature lovers of any age will dig it--but it doesn't go for flash the way 'Blue Planet' (admittedly only narrated by Attenborough) or 'Mammals' does.  Common species do the job of telling the story Attenborough has for us just as well as the species from the 'wind-swept plains of patagonia'.  With the stylistic flourish paired down, Attenborough's love and enthusiasm for avians shines through and we get something that all the special infra-red cameras and weird post-editing couldn't accomplish.  Ultimately, 'Life of Birds' is both informative and enduring, while Attenborough's continued arguments for conservation and preservation of species will fall silent on only the most unfeeling viewers.  If Attenborough's goal was to establish a sense of marvel toward a group of animals we often take for granted, he has accomplished this and perhaps a little more.
A strong series that stands alone or works well in conjunction with many of Attenborough's other works.  Recommended!",1063843200,16,1693,5.071942446043166
1223312,5,B00000ILG0,"This series is probably my favorite nature series ever made. The stunning close-up photography of so many exotic (and not so exotic) birds is fun and fascinating to watch as they go about their behaviors. Sir David's narration is, as in all his programs, charming and unintrusive. I reviewed the VHS release of this series a couple of years ago and was so happy when they annouced its release on DVD because of the usual improvements in transfer and audio quality. Whoever did the job should be ashamed of themselves because in some places the video is so grainy (check episode six) that it literally looks like some compressed MPEG or AVI file downloaded from the internet. In other areas it is less noticeable, but still no better than the VHS tapes. The audio sounds OK, but again it's not noticeably better. Other than the permanence of having it on DVD compared to VHS, I was very disappointed.",1056931200,12,899,4.69620253164557
1223313,5,B00000ILG0,"This is 580 minutes of spectacular footage and riveting narrative.  Sir David Attenborough is the supreme nature narrator and the BBC filmmakers are simply brilliant.  I couldn't pull myself away from the screen.  To see, up close and in perfect imagery, both the usual and the unusual life of birds, to see the vast range of species, habitats and habits... priceless.  Bird behaviour is fascinating, even more fascinating than you can imagine prior to viewing this series.
What an amazing world we live in and what a superb job these folks have done to bring us so close to the avian part of God's creation.  Don't miss it!  You'll want to watch them over and over.",1041465600,9,666,4.698275862068965
1223314,5,B00000ILG0,"This 3 dvd set, comprising ten one hour programs on various aspects about birds (hunting, singing, mating, parenting, etc.) is utterly fascinating and informative. However, the most amazing thing about it is the incredible photography. A documentary should be made explaining how they filmed it! Here we see views looking up from the bottom of a lake as a kingfisher dives into the water and snags a fish - amazing! Birds in flight are filmed as thought you are flying along side them. There are also some rare species which were captured on film for the first time. A truly stunning documentary and very educational. I had only one minor complaint - there was very little information about common birds that you might find in your garden here in the U.S., but that is a minor detail that can be overlooked.",1037145600,18,807,4.7304964539007095
1223325,5,B00000ILG0,"If you want to see the reality, beauty, and mysteries of birds this is the defining documentary. Sir David has, once again, outdone himself! A truely 'must see'.",1036281600,2,161,4.785714285714286
1223326,5,B00000ILG0,"It would take something spectacular for me to watch a DVD for 10 hours straight... and this is.  I laughed, I cried, I held my breath as 2 fighting hawks grasped talons in midair and spiraled down... would they realize that the ground was fast approaching? (Buy it and find out!)  Think of this series as an amalgamation of fascinating facts about different species' behavior as it relates to their commonalities, such as nesting.  Although no species is explored in depth, the vignettes are satisfying. (Although, I do want to know what happens to eggs that get buried completely and abandoned by their parents!) David Attenborough is his usual quirky self, appearing a few feet away from his subjects, and sometimes interacting with them.  His confrontation with a territorial Scottish grouse is priceless. The birds themselves, aided by spectacular photography, are truly wonders.  The shots of Lady Gould Finch and Zebra Finch nestlings' mouths were astonishing, and I doubt that people who raise them as pets have seen this.  There's not too much nasty stuff here, although I know more now than I want to about coot parents and brown pelican siblings, and what we humans do to Diksissels in South America is heartbreaking.  Kiwis to Kakapos, plovers to peacocks, they're all here.  If you are a bird lover, you will see a few familiar scenes (the million flamingos in the lake, the male emperor penguins incubating eggs on their feet), so you find yourself watching for favorites... will they show the amazing artistry of the Bowerbird? Willwe see the Palm Cockatoo beating a log with a stick to declare his territory?  I expected to see California Condors as the final bit (the subject is conservation) but instead got a delightful scene with a human caretaker flying his ultralight plane with his flock of Whoopers and Sandhill Cranes.  Give yourself (and your loved ones) a treat and buy this DVD!",1032739200,46,1905,4.925
1223327,5,B00000ILG0,"When my husband purchased this three-DVD series, I asked him, ""Are you really  SURE you are THAT interested in birds to watch ten hours of programs about them ?""  But from the first hour, I was hooked.  Every single episode relates so many different, interesting facts.  Some things I had wondered about for many years, and they were explained.
For example, why is it that the birds start singing the very second the first ray of sun comes over the horizon, and they go on singing very noisily for about 30 minutes, at which point they quiet down again?  (VERY annoying if you're trying to sleep.)  Well, the answer is that each bird knows all of its neighbors, and calls to each neighbor periodically throughout the day to be sure it is still there and well, and to be sure that no foreign bird has invaded its neighbors' territories.  Upon awaking each morning, each bird calls to it's own neighbors, particularly those of its own species, mainly to be sure that its neighbors are still alive and well.  (Most birds are blind at night.)  This exchange takes about half an hour, and is the birds' equivalent of our morning news.  That's why it stops after half an hour, when each bird has finished talking to each of its neighbors.  This is only one of the fascinating facts I remembered from this delightful series.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is the slightest bit interested in nature of any kind.",1031356800,4,1415,4.5936254980079685
1223328,5,B00000ILG0,"This is the BBC at its best. Further, it's Attenborough at his best too. The quality of the production shines through. It's luscious, rich, vibrant and makes this one of the best TV series of is type ever made.
This magnificent series makes you gasp in wonder at the sheer splendour and variety of birds on our planet. The photography and editing are first-rate. Attenborough's style is, as always, enthusiastic, knowledgable and supremely confident.
This, like many of the great BBC natural world series is the sort of programming that makes the rest of the world envy British TV viewers.",1003968000,3,589,4.9

1223330,5,B00000ILG0,"I'll start with these words:  I was not a bird watcher.  I was not into bird watching at all.  My hobbies mainly involved computers.  I graduated in Computer Engineering.
So why my 5-star rating on this piece of work?  Well, it is simply the most enjoyable long running documentary I have ever seen.
Every scene in this set has been filmed as if each frame was a work of art.  Seemingly impossible close-ups of birds in flight, as well as incredible film shots of different species of birds in their natural habitat, have been taken throughout the series.  Also, remarkable computer animations were used to render some prehistoric aerial creatures, as well as to enhance some explanation about the bird's vocal chords and bone structures.  One would wonder if such attention to photography would warrant a ""Making of..."" film.
But not only is the scenery stunning, Sir David Attenborough has a flair of teaching us the world of birds in ways that would grasp the attention of any viewer.  He does not go into complex, arcane description of each bird, but takes the time to introduce us to each species in a very friendly way.  No complex Latin description.  No dry description of the birds' characteristics.  Sir David Attenborough draws us in with his genuine fascination of each species.  He doesn't rely much on some birds' cuteness to get our attention.  He lures us with pure human curiosity.
A sparkle of humour here, a tiny amount of suspense there, and an engaging soundtrack all add to the narration, creating a documentary that should be known for its superb structure in teaching us the birds' way of living.
NOTE for DVD users:  At the time of writing this review, there is currently a DVD version available through the BBS website.  There are 3 DVD discs included, containing all 10 episodes.  Unfortunately, it seems to be restricted to the European market, since the prices are marked in pounds.  As you all know, DVD players can only play DVDs with the appropriate regional code, so it is unlikely that American DVD players can play imported European DVDs.  There is currently no plan to export the series into an American encoded DVD set.",978393600,121,2155,4.791327913279133
1223331,5,B00000ILG0,"I wasn't interested in birds when I recieved this series as a gift. But it is so remarkably well done that I'd recommend it to anyone, bird lover or not.
Attenborough's talent is to present fairly detailed information in a  very interesting fashion. He doesn't fail us in this series...the  photography is remarkable as well.
Perhaps the most remarkable footage  is of a bird that does a convincing imitation of a camera shutter, a car  alarm, and a chainsaw. You must see and hear to believe.",960595200,,493,4.6976744186046515

We've never been displeased with anything he has produced, and we think Life of Birds is one of his best! Mom has Alzheimer's and we search out good nature documentaries for her. This series touches home for her because her mother was an avid birdwatcher, so she grew up appreciating the beauty of birds. Life of Birds has introduced her, as well as myself, to varieties of birds we never knew existed. The one we watch over and over again is episode 7, Finding Partners. It's incredibly fascinating and beautiful! The way the birds court each other is superbly captured on film and we gasped over and over again.
