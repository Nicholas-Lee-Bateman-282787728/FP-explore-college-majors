The third volume in the series finds ""Star"" Chow Sing-Sing (Stephen Chow) finally engaged to his sweetheart Man (Sharla Cheung Man), but still working undercover for the HKPD's elite Special Duty Unit.

When a man named ""Million"" Wong is killed with an ice-pick, Chow (who is a dead ringer for him) is assigned by his superior to take his place and gather evidence as to who did it. One of the prime suspects is Wong's wealthy wife, the beautiful socialite Judy Tong-Wong (Anita Mui). While nervously expecting at any moment to be attacked by the murderer, Star has to spend a lot of time with the alluring Judy (which doesn't sit well with Man at all). There's also a gambling sub-plot involving another major suspect: the swindler Tailor Lam (Anthony Wong Chau-sang) and a sub-plot in which ""Star"" begins to question Man's fidelity.

The plot is mainly a parody of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct-1992/dp/B000E5N684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct (1992)</a>&nbsp;and partly a parody of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-Gamblers-2-1991/dp/B0002KPI7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of Gamblers 2 (1991)</a>&nbsp;- which director Wong Jing made with Stephen Chow two years earlier.

It is a good film, but it doesn't really link to the first two films at all and there are few characters carried over from the original plotline. Sorely missed is Chow movie stalwart Ng Man-tat playing bumbling police constable ""Uncle Tat"" Tso. The replacement of director Gordon Chan with Wong Jing also changes the structure of the film to be more about low-brow comedy and parody than the others. Fans of those movies may be disappointed, but fans of film parodies (and fans of the films it references) who are not familiar with the first two films  might really enjoy it.",1247616000,,1996,5.596026490066225
7905511,5,B000009HOG,"I'm not going to convince you that this is a great story line, but think Jim Carey in Chinese. Stephen Chow is Carey's equal in Hong Kong and famous for his comedy take offs on HK films. The saving grace of the movie is the perfomance of Anita Mui. Be honest - she's great in just about everything she does and her immitation of Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" is golden.",973209600,,372,4.253521126760563
