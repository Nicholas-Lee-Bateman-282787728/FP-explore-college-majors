7829252,5,6302689341,"The Phantome Rider is a Republic theatrical serial.  Otlaws are menacing the territory and the Indian reservation for their own greedy purposes.  A young school teacher hearing of the Indian legend of the Phantom Rider dawns a white costume and mask, and rides a white horse becoming the mysterious Phantom Rider come to life.

Followers of Marvel Comics might remember a short-lived western comic book series from teh mid-1960's by Stan Lee called ""The Ghost Rider.""  (Teh original Ghost Rider).

You may suspiciously find the comic book series to have a striking resemblance to this character in this movie serial.

Well, in the 1970's when Marvel Comics came out with the new Ghost Rider series (present day motorcycle daredevil Johnny Blaze), Marvel Comics wanted to reprint the original ""Ghost Rider"" (Western) series.  However, they had to change teh name in order to avoid confusion with the new ""Ghost Rider,"" so they renamed the character and the title of teh book ""Teh Phantom Rider.""  What a strange and amazing coincidence.  I'm sure by that time, this movie serial had fallen into public domain by this time.

But, anyway, if you like wesern masked avengers, this is a great serial.  I wish they'd put it out on DVD.

Also for you Marvel Comics readders who liked the original western ""Ghost Rider,"" you'll like this serial.",1272844800,2,1337,4.946188340807175
