4134487,2,B003L195C4,"I was really looking forward to receiving this set.  However, the picture quality was very poor and the sound was so bad I had to keep turning the volume up or down.  Very disappointing.",1285632000,7,186,4.4411764705882355
4134488,4,B003L195C4,"On entering my local DVD rental shop I was surprised to find the familiar face of Peter Bowles smirking down at me from the box cover of a thing called ""Lytton's Diary.""

Well, who could pass that up?

""Lytton's Diary"" turned out to be a British TV series from the 1980s that dealt with a London newspaper, and more specifically with the travails, agita and tsouris of producing a daily gossip column devoted to the foibles and shenanigans of the Brit chattering, entertaining, and empowered classes.  In the first episode, the column is initially called simply the ""Diary."" By the end of the episode, after some maneuvering, doube-crosses and sheer dumb luck, Peter Bowles as the eponymous Lytton becomes head honcho over the team that gathers in all the crumbs that go into what is then and thereafter known as ""Lytton's Diary.""

And that's fine with me.  I grew up in San Francisco where from the late 1930s to the 1980s, everyone either eagerly devoured the column of Herb Caen--in whichever of the daily fishwrappers he chose to honor with his presence--or loudly disdained it (after having eagerly devoured it.)  Lytton is not quite the inkstained royalty that Caen was, but he'll do.

By some sort of trans-Atlantic succession, ""Lytton's Diary"" appeared on the airwawes just as the American ""Lou Grant"" was departing.  Lou Grant, portrayed by Edward Asner, had been a much beloved comic character as Mary Richards' crusty boss in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""  After the conclusion of that show, the Grant character, now out of a job, applied for a slot as a reporter at a major metropolitan daily.  By the end of the first episode, by circumstances no more or less probable than those shown in ""Lytton's Diary,"" Grant ended up as daily editor of the city news section of his paper.

Grant was rough, gruff, rumpled in both apparel and spirit, and ultimately devoted to finding out the facts and printing the truth.  Lytton, on the other hand, was Saville Row-tailored, blow-dried, not quite totally reliable as lover, friend or boozing companion, and devoted to more than a little sinuosity in his ethics.

Both shows are probably pretty good indicators of the Zeitgeist of their respective times and places.  And both shows are unquestionably fn to watch.

One particularly striking thing about ""Lytton's Diary"" is that it is almost as good as a TARDIS trip to a far-distant place in the universe called the 1980s.  In that strange and dreamlike world, the natives wear long and elaborate hairstyles.  The men and most particularly Lytton wear skin-tight, over-tailored ""suits"" at all hours of the day, while devouring cigarettes and alcohol in prodigious quantities.  They speak into telephones attached to one another by wires and controlled by primitive rotating dials instead of push-buttons.  They write with the aid of large, hand-powered machines called ""typewriters"" in an open bullpen without a cubicle anywhere in sight.  The word ""computer"" is never to be spoken.

Just imagine!

Normally, I'd assign four stars to this sort of show, but the evocation of the 80s and the ever-so-slightly reptillian Bowles are vastly entertaining, so five stars--and may Bowles' scales never rust!",1283558400,10,3199,4.996226415094339
4134489,4,B003L195C4,"A wonderful change of pace in British Drama. London--Fleet Street shown in it's news days, when the street was teeming with reporters and photographers scurrying after the scoop. Each episode is a different story with a surprise ending. The news team observed is the gossip page: ""Lytton's Diary"". It takes about a half dozen reporters to publish the daily page of gossip and Lytton (Peter Bowles) is their leader.

Several guest stars are included like: Edward Hardwicke (Sherlock Holmes); John Hallman (The Pallisers-truly great series); Mel Martin (Love for Lydia); & Trevor Peacock (Vicar of Dibley).

The series having originally run in 1985-86 gives it a bit of a period feel. Fun. A newsroom teeming with electric typewriters and 2-tone (green/gray) dial phones. Afro-blond hair for a do. Also, due to age, the picture sometimes appears a bit over-exposed (an 80's film quirk I've seen before) so I cut back a 1/4 star as a result. Actually, outdoor scenes looks like London fog, smoke in the many pub sets, and oh, the shower scene. After getting involved in the interesting stories, it is forgotten. The absence of subtitles earned a decrease by just 1/4 star. It's helpful for us older folks, but we still enjoyed this series, without script. That leave ""Lytton's DIARY"" a SOLID 4 1/2 stars for almost ten hours of viewing (12 episodes).

You may experience some disappointment at the end of the last episode when you realize you have just watch the COMPLETE COLLECTION of ""Lytton's Diary"". You will want more.

I'm watching it in sessions since there are different stories. I'm used to watching continuing episodes of the ""same story,"" so I don't feel the need to watch all at once (as I did in To the Manor Born, for instance).

I have enjoyed the plots and characters. I recommend it.....",1459296000,2,417,4.415584415584416
