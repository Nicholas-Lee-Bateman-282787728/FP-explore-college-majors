8393048,3,B003ANP8EM,"I think this set is adorable because not only do you get three classic Thomas & Friends DVDs but you also get a carrying case!  The episodes are from 2005, 2005, and 2007 so they are older and original Thomas DVDs.  Aidan liked them, but he prefers the newer Thomas episodes in CGI animation, but he does absolutely love the case!  I think this pack would be perfect for any Thomas fan as you get a little of everything with it and for the price, you can't go wrong!",1277078400,3,466,4.213483146067416
