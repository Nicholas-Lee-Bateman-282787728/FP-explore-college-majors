7987618,5,B00008WJEW,"For some reason I had the impression Season 1 was inferior, so I began with Seasons 3 and 4. However, I enjoyed the Best of Season 1 most of all! There is a feeling of comraderie and a better flow to the episodes than in the later seasons. Perhaps the acting isn't as good, I don't know if I'm a goo judge of that, but I don't mind as long as it's enjoyable and relaxing. Perhaps in the later seasons they tried to make the social issues more prominent or realistic. In any case, this DVD is just good, clean fun!",1355356800,,513,4.089108910891089
7987619,3,B00008WJEW,"The quality of the DVD is excellent. I wish it had come with English subtitles as well as Spanish. I cannot argue with the choice of episodes, but why only five? It would have gotten five stars if it had included episodes such as ""Target: Angels"" (which featured a pre-Magnum Tom Selleck as Kelly Garrett's date), ""Angels In the Army"", and the one about Jill working under-cover as a roller derby babe.",1347148800,,402,4.597222222222222
7987620,5,B00008WJEW,"These women will always be known to have fueled the feminist movement in showing women in dangerous situations and winning. Men still love this show because of the MUCHO sex-appeal(especially Fawcett and Smith;Jackson is not bad either!). Not as racy as the new version with Lucy Lui and Cameron Diaz(others too!) but Fawcett in one episode might change your mind in that category(she plays a prostitute;the v-neck outfit from Heaven;WOW!!). If you watched it and liked it in the 70's, this will bring back good memories.",1277078400,,521,5.069767441860465
7987621,3,B00008WJEW,"I've seen most of the 1st 2 seasons and some of 3 and 4.
I saw seance for the 1st time the other week and thought it was really well done and a great performance by Jaclyn Smith.",1066262400,6,178,3.710526315789474
7987622,4,B00008WJEW,"When these shows first came out, I was eleven years old.  I really didn't get a chance to see much of this first season when it ran in 1976, but I knew all about the three women who were the Angels thanks to tons of magazine coverage.  The show was a phenomenom.  Everybody had the Farrah poster!

Jump to today.  This set is a very nice, complete view of season 1 (the only season Farrah was on the show).  It includes the pilot and 22 episodes.  Some are good and hold up with time.  A couple are clinkers.  But, the sound and video reproduction are good and it is easy to see why everyone was so spellbound by the show - Kate, Farrah and Jackelyn were stunning.",1055894400,10,664,4.165354330708661
