1694481,5,B000063W2R,"I'm 47 years old, and it takes a LOT for a cartoon to impress me. I became hopelessly addicted to the Powerpuff Girls in 1995, and this movie just renews my love of the franchise.
The movie was everything I expected and much more from Craig McCracken and the entire PpG staff that put this wonderful movie together. If this movie doesn't become a cult anime classic, I'll eat my entire PpG comic book collection!
This is indeed the best cartoon movie I have seen in years.",1025740800,15,472,4.436781609195402
1694482,5,B000063W2R,"It's nice when a movie exceeds expectations as nicely as the Powerpuff Girls.  The plot is fairly simple.  It's an origin story (the kind ALL superhero movies are) where the girls meet everyone for the first time.  I promise I'm not giving anything away here.  This all becomes very evident while the credits are still rolling.  The movie is fairly short.  In fact, if you know what to look for, you will realize that this is simply three episodes of the tv series put together the way the Samurai Jack movie was done.  So whats to like about this movie?  Script:  Same witty one-liners, puns and culteral references we've come to expect from Powerpuff Girls. (Human has kept monkey under his thumb for too long!  Now we must oppose that thumb and begin our Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes!)  There is a fair amout of violent sight gags and a little crude humor, but no more than you would come to expect from the tv series.  Music: Ranges from orchestral to techno-pop.  Nothing to make an album out of, but it's always the right tune, for the right amount of time, at the right time. Animation:  The character designs have not changed in any way.  The girls move (slightly) more fluidly, and a combination of cel art and 3d computer graphics really bring Townsville to life.  Normally, I hate combining CG with cel art, but it works here.  Overall, it was a treat, and this is one film I will certainly buy when it comes out on DVD.",1025740800,2,1437,4.4653846153846155
1694483,5,B000063W2R,"I love the Powerpuff girl-cartoons. The film was great and had it all-adventure, comedy, they're cute Bubbles, and creativeness. The film was cute and was as good as Scooby-Doo. However M. Lillard (who played Shaggy) would bring up a hard competition! The movie was exactly like the cartoon series and is for all Powerpuff girls fans, Cartoon network cartoons fans, and for Girl power based flick fans! The girls are really like everyday children except for their super powers of coarse. It's a film that will be inspiring to children. I laughed during a lot of scenes.
  Those who weren't Powerpuff girls fans before probably will be now. All Powerpuff Girls fans won't be disappointed! The light humour, wise cracks, and lovable characters make this cartoon enjoyable. It's a Warner Bros flick that's worth watching for anyone who enjoys animated series. As well as entertaining you, the film features morals about making the right choices. Young kids will especially be entertained throughout the movie with adorable little heroes (heroines) fighting crime and trying to save the world. It's a hard-not-to like version of Arnold S action flicks with cutsey pie jokes and enjoyable scenes. It has fun adventure that mainly people who love goofiness in flicks will love. It's a movie version that both adults &kids would love. It has a clever plot and a good story.
  For those who have no idea what the Powerpuff Girls story is about- you'll have no problem. The movie tells you everything-about how Bubbles, Buttercup, and Blossom turn into super heroes and how they got to fighting crime! It's without doubt (alongside Lilo&Stich) the year's funniest animated feature!
  Overall it's a pleasing feature and is so far funnier than any film I've watched this year! I guarantee fun but once again that's possible if you enjoy light comedies and animated features! As for all Powerpuff Girl fans-you'll all love it! Those of you who very rarely like cartoons but enjoyed the very entertaining Monsters Inc... This probably isn't something for you!...",1025740800,6,2050,5.050295857988166

I was pretty impressed.  Not quite as inpressed, however, as I was after I finished watching the movie.

1694537,4,B000063W2R,"Review of the product: With the new show out (which I don't watch), I felt the need to revisit this movie. As a kid, I watched this movie quite a few times, so this was a nice little nostalgic experience for me. Based on what I heard, this movie did horribly in the theaters back at its release. Personally, that makes me feel a bit sad. Possibly due to its lack of popularity there are very few releases of this movie on DVD and none on Blu Ray as of (June 2016). I struggled to find this in stores. I couldn't find a copy of this even in stores dedicated to selling used DVDs. As a result, I ended up ordering this from Amazon. To my knowledge, this movie is out of print. So if you want a brand new copy of this movie, good luck. Honestly, buying a used copy will be your best option, since they are much cheaper. But be sure that the DVD is in good condition before making a purchase. My copy has a super warn out case, covered in scuff marks and paint ware. But somehow, the disk is in near perfect condition, I'm grateful for that. These come in a cardboard folding case with the title of each scene displayed on the inside. Note that this movie is NOT available in widescreen. This may bother some of you, but personally, I'm able to get passed this. Its punishment enough that they don't produce this movie at all anymore. I think that's a slightly bigger issue than not having it in widescreen. Review for the movie below.

Review for the movie: This is a super short movie. Its roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Which is barely long enough to qualify as a ""feature length film"" The movie is super simple (some may consider it a clich of a story). This starts off by presenting the Powerpuff Girls origins story with a cinematic treatment. This is something most of us have already seen dozens of times from the TV show intro. From then on, the girls are learning about the new world, since they were born yesterday. Throughout, they learn life lessons, how to control their powers, and try to fit in with the world as by gaining their later known reputation as super heroines. The movie has a darker tone and is filled with some humorous pop culture references here and there. But honestly, I feel like the majority of this film felt rather gloomy. Most of the movie is spent with the girls down of their luck, and being mistreated and taken advantage of by other characters. This is a nit pick. But I would have preferred a Powerpuff Girls movie with more feel good moments, and a more light hearted relationship with other charcters.",1465171200,2,2547,4.3734177215189876

1694542,5,B000063W2R,"The Powerpuff Girls Movie is a delightful film about of the coming of age of three little superhero girls. Its filled with a wonderful animation style, likeable characters, an intense soundtrack, and corny jokes. This film is not just good at making you smile and laugh, however. The Powerpuff Girls Movie is excellent about using colour to give you some insight to how the characters relate to one another and how the setting relates to the current point in the story line.
The use of colour is a visual cue that everyone ends up noticing, whether they are intentionally paying attention to it or not. Immediately when the film starts we are introduced to the colour and setting relationship. The setting is Townsville and is immediately shown to the viewer as being a muted green and very gloomy.  This an appropriate colour choice for Townsville because the narrator then tells the viewer that the city is in need of a hero and needs to be brightened up.
Professor Utonium is a very pale man with black hair and a black and white outfit. When the professor is in his laboratory working on a mixture, he blends in. The room itself is very black and white with the exception of the chemicals he uses. The chemicals are so colourful because they are the meaning and purpose of Professor Utoniums world. All the professor does is work in his lab. The only chemical that is not colourful is called Chemical X. The Chemical X is black and colourless because it brings mischief to the substance it is dripped into. This chemical causes havoc in the movie. The professor in his black and white clothes in his black and white room working with colourful chemicals when all of a sudden the black Chemical X drips into his mixture. From the combination of chemicals the professor concocted, the three powerpuff girls are formed.
The formation of the powerpuff girls, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, is an immediate colour addition to the professors life. Blossom, named for her directness and opening up to the professor, wears a pink outfit and has red hair. Her outfit colour symbolises her niceness and sweetness to people. Bubbles, named for being cute and bubbly, wears a light blue outfit and has blonde hair. Her outfit colour symbolises being bubbly, because water is blue. Buttercup, named for no other reason than, it also begins with a B, wears a green outfit and has black hair. Her outfit colour symbolises being tough and envious, because green is often associated with boys and also with jealousy.
Once the powerpuff girls are introduced, the rest of the world brightens up, too. There is a room in the professors house that gets created for the powerpuff girls that is varying shades of pink with bedding to match the colours of the powerpuff girls. The atmosphere and the outside world get brighter instead of being muted and gloomy as they were before. In addition to the new colours, happy and upbeat music plays as the girls are happy.
With all this colour there has to be some darkness, right? Well, there is. Amidst all of the joy, cheer, and colour, there is a cut away to a monkey with an exposed brain lurking in the shadow. This is foreshadowing for our evil, primate villain, Mojo Jojo. Before we are formally introduced to Mojo Jojo, we are introduced to straight up villains. They are green in colour and look very sickly. As far as shape goes they go through the variety: skinny, tall, lanky, huge, short, boxy, and angular. We never are told their names in the movie, but in the television series we find out some of the names: Snake, The Gangreen Gang, Ace, Big Belly, LilArturo, and Grubber. The colour of the villains paired with their shape set the apart from the regular people of Townsville.
 After the powerpuff girls encounter the villains and promptly beat them, they meet Mojo Jojo. He introduces himself as just Jojo. Mojo Jojo stays tucked away in the dark in his box and tries to get the girls to sympathise with him. He succeeds and gets them to be a part of his evil plan, which he tries to pass off as good. The powerpuff girls build him a lab.
 Mojo Jojos lab suits him very well. The lab itself is a green colour on the inside when Mojo Jojo is present and working on things, while Mojo Jojo is a red colour. Green and red are complimentary colours to each other on the colour wheel, so the colour choice for Mojo Jojo and his laboratory make sense. He and the lab are meant for each other.
 Mojo Jojo is not the only person who is complimented by their environment. The same goes for Professor Utonium. The professor is black and white, with his new environment (after the creation of the girls) being quite colourful. The professor is complimented by his new environment. This could even apply to the powerpuff girls. A common environment for them in this movie is to be fighting villains. The villains in Townsville look very different from the powerpuff girls, so they are complimented by their environment.",1446681600,,4953,4.670103092783505

The writing is as good or better than in the TV series, though it does take itself more seriously than the series normally does. The art is in the same style as in the TV series, but with better production values. It is a little violent for young children, but then the same can be said for the TV series.

1694667,3,B000063W2R,"The Powerpuff Girls movie was the first attempt at a feature film about the three heroines of the show of the same name. Unfortunately it also looks like the last what with the show no longer running on Cartoon Network (at least not on the regular channel).

I see there are a lot of complaints about the violence in this film. Part of the backlash I feel is due to lack of parental investigation into the media beforehand. The Powerpuff Girls isn't My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic--it's always basically been about three magically created heroines who beat the snot out of super villains, but just happen to be little girls. The show plays out like most cartoons do, in which most of them are indeed episodic and almost never have an actual moral. It's just something fun and pretty for the kids to watch, with a few adult jokes thrown in (nothing obvious, so they're handled with subtlety). The violence in the cartoon was done more for comedic shock than anything else, I believe. That said, when regarding the movie, I don't feel the complaints are entirely without merit, which leads me to the problems with the film.

There is quite a bit of violence in the movie, but it's not the standard cartoon violence we've come to expect. The movie is about the PPG becoming Townsville's heroines. Unfortunately their powers are extremely dangerous and they have problems being accepted by the town and its inhabitants at first. After destroying much of the town in what was supposed to be a harmless game of tag, it begins a usual film cliche' about how people often ostracize those who are different. This becomes especially true when they run into ""Jojo"", who is in fact Mojo Jojo before he became a fully established villain. This movie also incorporates his backstory from the show in which he was Professor Utonium's ""assistant"", meaning he was virtually a lab monkey who loved destroying everything in the lab and was subsequently responsible for the PPG being born (during this scientific disaster he was also granted super intelligence). The PPG run into him when they're attacked by the Gangrene Gang, but they haven't used their powers to fight before and remain helpless. This begins one of many rather dark scenes in the film: the colors in the animation are very dark, it's raining, and you have three helpless little girls at the mercy of a gang of guys in a back alley. It really looks pretty darn scary, like something out of a child's nightmare. It makes me think of scenarios and tones I've seen in Batman: The Animated Series. Jojo saves them, which leads to further scary moments with a rather serious scene about them discussing how unfair it is that Townsville treats them like freaks. This sets up Jojo's plan to manipulate and use the girls' powers to take over Townsville and then, the world.

The issue is the real ""meat"" of the movie isn't seasoned properly, and while it starts off fine, it goes out of its element at points to where it feels like it's trying to be an X-Men film. The Powerpuffs eventually realize that Jojo tricked them when he uses an army of monkeys to take over the town, and they fly from the earth into space, and sit there in despair. (Jeez.) The rest of the film involves them returning, realizing they can use their powers to fight, and having a showdown with a giant Mojo Jojo and realizing he was the real monster all along while protecting Townsville and winning their adoration and love.

While this isn't a bad plot for the film in itself, the production choices were very weird. Most of the entire film is dark in tone and looks, except for the opening and scenes where Jojo is baiting the PPG to help him. There's little of the brightly colored animation we usually see in the cartoon. While this isn't the darkest place I've seen the creators take the series (that would be when the PPG went ahead in time by accident and saw that Him, the PPG version of the Devil, had taken over Townsville and destroyed it in their absence), this film is a good contender for second place. So while I can't say The Powerpuff Girls has always been sweet and mindless fluff, I don't think it was a fantastic choice on the creators' part to make the meat of the feature movie their ""Let's Get Dark and Scare the Kids"" special that in the show they only did on occasion. While Mojo Jojo is sort of the girls' ""main nemesis"" in comparison to the other villains of the show, I also found it weird that they chose to expand on his backstory when it's something the show had already done before. When you look at all the things they COULD have done it seems like an okay choice, but the way they handled it might have been a bit too bizarre.

For the record, I enjoyed much of the film, but what I want to drive home is that it wasn't because it reminded me of a basic PPG episode. While I rather enjoyed the very heavy subject matter they tried to get across and that the series has never treated its kid audience like idiots, I found the majority of direction choices very out of place for the PPG franchise as a whole. Still the action is pretty good, the fights are good, the pacing is alright, and the animation is very nice. It's not a ""bad"" film--just very oddly directed.

In short, The Powerpuff Girls SERIES is meant for kids and is relatively harmless. If you have a problem with the violence though, I would steer the little ones away from both the series and this movie. If you're an older fan of the series you still may enjoy the movie for its animation, good voice acting, and rather darkly produced plot. It's a good popcorn movie. If you're a parent, I would skim the film first though to see if you think your kids can handle it.",1339718400,,5690,4.524781341107872

1694723,4,B000063W2R,"I think Cartoon Network's very first (and perhaps only?) theatrical release is one of the neatest animated films I've seen in my time.

The story is basically the origin story of the Powerpuffs - when they were first created and how they saved the day with their unusual powers.  This movie has the original characters from our young heroes to the Professor to the evil Mojo Jojo.  One thing that makes this movie super-exciting is the really fast fly-throughs and fight scenes within Townsville.  Either way, it's one of the greatest action movies in the animation industry.

Now the DVD has the full-length movie and a whole lot more.  They include deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes features, character interviews and commentaries, and, of course, the ""Dexter's Laboratory"" cartoon short originally released before the film.

1694728,4,B000063W2R,"I'm in the category where I'm watching this having never seen an episode of the Powerpuff Girls. Recently, I started becoming interested in voice acting and was checking out many animation shows to ""hone my skills"" when this one grabbed my interest. The movie is basically for those like me that never watched the show but it might spoil you.

Professor Utonium wants to create some daughters using sugar, spice and everything nice but his monkey Mojo knocks some Chemical X into the solution causing the monkey to grow a gigantic brain and 3 girls: Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. Each one is unique with Blossom being the leader type and quick to come up with a solution, Bubbles is the emotional and sickeningly cute one while Buttercup is the brass tough one(who sounds like Tommy from Rugrats which is no surprise since Elizabeth Daily provided that voice).

An innocent game of tag at school however gets the girls very competitive when they start thrashing Townsville with their speed and strength. They are then disdained by the public, the professor included. Walking home, they run into Mojo who wants to create the ""make-the-town-a-better-place"" machine so the girls help him unbeknown to them what his real intentions are. He kidnaps all the monkeys and causes them to wreck havoc. So of course the girls must save the day.

You get many origins in the show of course not just the start of the Girls and Mojo Jojo but also the shows catchphrase ""saving the world before bedtime"" and just who exactly named the Powerpuff Girls.

The animation looks nice but most likely you've seen better but that's not really the point. This is the style of the series but the animation is a bit more ambitious with multi-plane shots and some 3D backgrounds or backgrounds that look 3D.

The voice actors do a good job and to be honest, my favorite would have to be the high pitched Bubbles played by Tara Strong. Roger Jackson(a.k.a ""the voice on the phone"" from the Scream movies) does a good job as Mojo Jojo including a fast little rant regarding his plans.

1694751,4,B000063W2R,I have to say that this movie is one of the best adaptations fromthe Television to the big screen. A great storyline including the creation of The Powerpuff Girls and their ascendence from little girls with superpowers to heroes of the world. The movie is great and the DVD has a load of special features including the Dexter's Lab short that was shown in the theater along with the movie. The only reason I gave this DVD a 4 star rating is because there is no widescreen version. I saw this movie in the theater and noticed throughout the DVD version some things I had seen in the theater wasn't there. I hope Warner Bros. releases a widescreen version of this sometime in the future.,1088035200,3,685,4.488
1694752,5,B000063W2R,"Bottom line, this movie is awesome! I never even really watched the Powerpuff Girls until my sister bought me this movie as a joke for my 19th birthday (I'm a guy). Obviously I thought that this movie would be to ""kid-ish"" for me. How inconceivably wrong I was. I never imagined how great this movie would be. When we watched it, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie. Since then I have become a huge Powerpuff Girls fan, mainly because the series is so well done, and I've never seen violence and cuteness blend so well (I don't think I've ever even seen it attempted actually). I could go into depth of everything I loved about this movie and all the references it makes to pop-culture and such, but everyone before me has done that so I'll stick to the main points. First off, as you probably already know, the movie is a prequel to the series. It shows how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo came to be their arch nemesis. The film is non-stop action and cuteness, a nice break from the mind-numbing lameness of most ""superhero"" movies.  Although it is advertised as a ""children's movie"", I think this film is definitely entertaining to all ages, if not more so to teenagers and adults (my opinion). As I've said there is quite a bit of violence, but not anymore than the series. I think that if you let your kid watch the TV show, then this movie shouldn't be any worse. This however is only my opinion and that decision should be left to you. Another thing about this movie and the TV show as well....is that the soundtrack (the music in the background) is so perfectly orchestrated for every scene. It really makes every scene and action sequence so much more enjoyable. My only complaint is about the DVD and is of course the lack of widescreen, this is an action movie. The plot in this film is not twisting at every corner obviously, but there is an actual plot, and I guess you can find some ""morals"" in it too. I won't go into what happens in the movie, because that wouldn't really be a good review. I love all the characters though, especially the girls themselves. You would never think that someone could make such  adorable superheroes that are so entertaining. Mojo Jojo is also very entertaining, and the dialogue is great. This is dragging on so I'll wrap it up. This movie can be enjoyed by die-hard Powerpuff Girls fans and people who have never even heard of them before. I must mention one more thing. Someone else in a review said that if you are a ""monkey fan"" you should see this movie because there are a lot of monkeys in it. If you are a monkey fan, I really don't think you should see this movie. Sure there are a lot of monkeys at one point, but I'm not gonna say how many are left at the end of the film. All in all this movie is fantastic and has grown to be my favorite movie of all time (no joke), and therefore I highly recommend it to everyone. Thank you.",1079481600,2,2920,4.385608856088561
1694753,2,B000063W2R,"If you like Powerpuff Girls you will love this movie. It's well written and nicely animated and is generally, well, a whole lot of fun.
However... The fact that this movie is not avaliable in it's original wide screen format is truly disgusting.
If you didn't see it in the theater then I guess you can watch this DVD and be blissfully unaware of all the footage you're missing. But to me, it's ruined. I got this DVD as a present, watched it once and was so annoyed by the butchering of the film I haven't watched it since.
So, even though I'd give the movie itself five stars I had to give the DVD two. And being a fan of the Powerpuff Girls that was hard to do.",1076284800,5,664,4.155038759689923
1694754,5,B000063W2R,"""This is the best gift ever."" ""Yes, it is.""
I've never been a huge fan of The PowerPuff Girls. The show was always kind of hit and miss for me. But some of the episodes were truly brilliant, and when I heard that the movie was coming to theaters I was definitely interested. Maybe it was the trailer, maybe it was all the other movies that came out at the same time; or maybe I was just busy. But somehow or other I never got around to seeing this movie in theaters. For a long time now (ever since the DVD came out) I've wanted to give it a rent. I rented it a few weeks ago and bought it almost immediately afterward. I feel like I horribly cheated myself by missing this one in theaters. Many people who haven't seen this movie probably think what I first thought when I heard about the movie. ""Probably largely more of the same."" More cuteness, more simple yet stylish animation, and WAY more fight scenes, right? WRONG!
From the moment the movie starts, it's apparent that WAY more work went into this movie than into your average episode of the series. WAY better animation, WAY better music, WAY better dialog. TONS of character development. Dramatic camera angles. Yes, all the good things that make great anime, or great cartoons, or great movies, crammed into a little over an hour. If you've ever watched an episodes of Dexter's Lab or PowerPuff girls, you know what to expect. Parody of classic movies (in this case, especially planet of the apes), with cool zoom-out shots, ominous villain laughing and slick action sequences. And speaking of action...
""You're it!""
Does this movie have action? Yes it does. But not non-stop way-too much action. More a situation starts slow then gets progressively more energetic as dramatic tension builds and then fury is unleashed in an awesome high-speed fight.
Take the infamous tag sequence for example. When the girls first go to school we, like the professor, just know that something is going to go wrong. They're going to cause destruction with their powers. But when he goes to pick them up they're playing hopscotch and other little kid games, being perfect little angels. Then someone shows them how to play tag. And naturally, Buttercup isn't content with just running at normal speed. As the girls chase each other, they gradually build up speed until the ground behind them starts to melt, and then they take off into the air. The music builds up at just the right time and in the right way to get your heart pumping during this scene, and I don't think I've ever seen a scene in a movie that better conveys the sheer joy a person would experience if they could propel their self at almost limitless speed.
""How can you understand what it means to be...A FREAK!?""
This another interesting thing about this movie is the fact that it is about the origins of the PowerPuff Girls. Hasn't that already been covered? Don't we already know about that? Do we really need to go over this again?! Oh yes indeed. As this movie takes it's time to cover the story of how the girls were created, how they experience the fear and sadness of being different from everyone else, and how they ultimately attain their resolve to use their powers to fight for good and to save people. One of, if not THE cornerstone of the movie is undoubtedly the one who eventually becomes the Powerpuff Girls' archnemesis, Mojo Jojo. In this movie we see an interaction between the evil one and the girls unlike any other seen in the series. Mojo is evil, and has plans for world domination. But the girls don't know that. And when he asks for their help, they unwittingly find themselves assisting Mojo in his greatest and first plan ever. Now, Mojo has had a lot of plans, but I can never recall one that worked out quite this cool. You have to see it for yourself.
""a Sweeter time, when there was a Spice to life, and everything was...Nice.""
Besides the exceptional camera angles, dialog, and action sequences, the dvd of this movie features truly exceptional picture quality. I first watched it on a progressive-scan dvd player hooked up to a widescreen HDTV. I thought the picture was widescreen until I looked on the movie box. The image does not appear to be cropped or panned anywhere (despite the fact that it HAS been cropped from its original aspect ratio). And the picture is super-crisp with fantastically vivid colors.
""And so, for the first time, the day is saved...""
Overall, if you're a fan of the Powerpuff girls, you it to yourself to buy this movie immediately. And if you don't like the Powerpuff girls that much...you should at least give it a rent. It's a self-contained movie of the highest quality, and it blows many bigger-budget, higher-grossing animated films out of the water.",1067385600,,4734,4.636904761904762
1694755,5,B000063W2R,"The PowerPuff Girls movie goes beyond what any conventional animated cartoon's limits. The action, emotion, plot twists, over the top finale, everything is PowerPacked the PowerPuff Girl way.
Our story begins with the Girl's creation. After witnessing a supermarket holdup, Professor Utonium, decides to create perfect little girls, little does he know, his Chemical X, accidentally mixed in with his concoction of sugar, spice, and everything nice, results in the most powerful kindergarteners anywhere. Thus, the PowerPuff Girls were born! Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.
Blossom, the intellectual, is the leader of her superhero trio. Brainy and sassy, she can outwit even the most enormous monster, or the most sinister villain, even Mojo Jojo!
Bubble is the cute and cuddly comic relief. Make no mistakes though, she may spend her off-time coloring and playing with her stuffed animals, but when the bad guys come around, Bubbles has proven time and time again that she's just as tough (and sometimes even tougher, than her sisters).
Buttercup (so named because it also begins with B) is the tough one. She's a miniature cartoon version of  Joan Jett. She likes to fight bad guys, and doesn't take crap from anyone.
As our story continues, we meet the mayor, Miss Bellum, the kindergarten teacher, and of course the most evil presence to come along since Darth Vader, Mojo Jojo! He may be no taller than 2 feet (with a foot high brain!), but he is the essence of pure evil. Though he can never decide if he wants to rule the world or destroy it.
In this grand film of epic proportions, Mojo tricks the girls into building his secret laboratory. It is located conveniently in the center of Townsville on top of an active volcano. After his lair is complete, Mojo gets enough chemical X to inject all the primates at the zoo.
You can imagine the chaos and panic that comes from that! Squadrons of flying monkeys that spit a rainstorm, a mighty gorilla who wants to rival Mojo, an orangutan driving a machine of mass destruction, white polar wicked monkey, sonic booming cymbal playing monkey, and a crazed chimpanzee that needs a straight jacket.
Watch in amazement time and time again. With each viewing you'll see something different. You'll laugh, cry, and cheer for the girls.",1065657600,,2284,4.947916666666667

This movie is a treat and must-own for fans of the TV series, and an excellent intro for first-timers.  Something to notice about this show, particularly the TV series, is how it's obviously influenced (stylistically) by Japanese animation, yet in my opinion this is visually of a more refined and tasteful quality than the typical ""Japanimation""/anime that I've seen.  Anime fanatics will probably call me bad names for that, but that is my opinion.
Another thing to notice...
though it's marketed (toys, accessories, etc) to little girls, this is *not* a kid's cartoon, in the same way that the best Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, and Tex Avery-produced cartoons are not for kids.  The writing, the voice acting, and the characters are very well done.  In short, this is a quality, very enjoyable series, and the movie only reinforces this.  The only short-coming to this movie is that North America is limited, for some inconceivable reason, to the full-screen version.  However...if you have a multi-region DVD player (like I do) then you must get the Region 2 (UK) version, which is the wide-screen version.",1065657600,,1203,4.985

I don't think the PPG attract a much wider audience just because they make a movie of it. The result is that most fans sit there and yawn while experiencing bad re-makes of scenes already made in the TV episodes. The humor isn't as good in the movie either, the whole impression I get is that the whole concept has been polished by ""specialists"" who believe that they know what should appeal to a mainstream audience. However, what I believe appeals to adult PPG fans is the mix of cute little kindergarten girls who beat evil people as bad as one can without getting a PG13 rating, combined with a semi-adult sense of humor. Kind of a version of the South Park humor, but without the edges and the pee&poo jokes. Which is too bad, if you ask me. ;)",1059177600,,922,4.366279069767442

I had never seen the Powerpuff Girls before, and they instantly made my Top 10.  This movie rocks!
The animation is quirky, distinctive, and very cool.  Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup are loveable, and very spunky.  Mojo Jojo is a very cool villain.  The action is awesome and breathtaking--not for the faint of heart, neither for young children.  The plot, although formulaic, does take some unexpected turns (which are a blast!).  The laughs just keep on coming.  It's a shame this movie did so poorly in the box office, because it deserved more recognition.  Who cares if it's wacky, weird, and over-the-top?  It's one of the most entertaining movies ever!  This should've been nominated for best Animated feature (although Spirited Away did deserve the actual award).

1694781,3,B000063W2R,If you are a fan of the PPG you will love this movie. I sometimes watch the TV Show and decided to see this movie. The movie is basically what happened in Townsville before the PPG and when the city was first learning to accept them. I would recomend this movie for people 12 and under. If you like the PPG TV Show you should deffinetly see this movie. It did not fall short of my expectations at all.,1052611200,,401,4.0886075949367084
1694782,5,B000063W2R,"""The Powerpuff Girls - The Movie"" is my first exposure to The Powerpuff Girls.  Lacking cable, I have never seen the show on The Cartoon Network, nor have I seen any of the other DVDs available.  Of course, I knew the characters but only from the various merchandise.
With that in mind, I really enjoyed the flick.  It has pretty much everything I want from a film like this; good, stylistic animation, well-paced, clever multi-level humor, cute character design, and a plethora of monkeys.  A really good movie overall!  I am pleasantly surprised, and will probably check out some of the Cartoon Network DVDs now.  The animation and story is not up to the level of Samurai Jack, but it is great for what it is.
As to the DVD, it is a little lackluster, but not too bad. For any theatrical film, a widescreen presentation is expected, and pan-and-scan is never welcome.  The character interviews are great, maybe one of the funniest extras I have seen on a cartoon DVD.  All in all, a fun DVD to have.",1047945600,5,1001,4.553072625698324
1694783,3,B000063W2R,"There's nothing really BAD about this movie--it's got the same sense of humor and the same witty voice performances that effervesce through every episode of the series.
But it all feels too familiar, like there was nothing new to offer. The story is a prequel to the TV series--we all know how the girls were created, but we've never seen their origin story played out. Problem is, once the Chemical X spills into the mix, the rest of the film is just filling in blanks. What did they do on their first day of school? How did they become the heroic trio that Townsville has come to depend on? How did Mojo Jojo first make himself known? The answers to those three questions are pretty much the whole film and, honestly, there's not a single surprise in any of the movie's answers. The whole thing plods along with a sense of obligation and very little excitement.
I'm not sure why a widescreen version wasn't made available (probably monetary reasons, given that the film flopped), but the fullscreen is decent enough.
Kids will like it, but probably find it a bit too long. Adult fans of the PPGs will likely enjoy it once or twice, then return to watching the superior DVD collections of past episodes.",1046217600,3,1204,4.604651162790698

Clocking in at just over an hour, ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" plays like an extended episode of the hit cartoon, but with more mayhem and slightly better animation. This is the origin story of the Powerpuff Girls, three children made of sugar, spice, everything nice and Chemical X. But the scheming Mojo Jojo has nasty plans for the girls, who have uncanny superpowers. This is a film that is sure to delight all ages, but will appeal more to preadolescent kids. While the movie appears to be aimed at little girls, even I, a 17-year-old male was entertained from start to finish.",1041033600,,639,4.714285714285714
1694785,4,B000063W2R,"""The City of Townsville...."" The first words of every single episode of ""The Powerpuff Girls."" When Cartoon Network started drawing those three little girls and that city did they know that it would become such a huge hit? Probally no. The film baffled me a little bit also. The success of the television show is so huge. People buy products all the time and there is always some sort of buzz about ""The Powerpuff Girls."" If the idea and the show are so huge, why didn't the film do as well at the box office? It was number 9 on the top then on it's first weekend last summer. I don't really see why though. I think that this movie should have did better. The critics thought it was great and the few people sho saw it liked it.
I didn't see it in the theatres. I have only seen about ten episodes of the show and that was right before the movie came out in theatres. I didn't get to see it in the theatres so I had to wait untill it's release on DVD. I can't reveiw the features on the DVD but I can talk about the film itself as a whole. I saw the movie on a Pay Per Veiw cable thing.
For those of you who have watched the show, you know that it is about three little girls who were invented by The Professor. They were created by ""sugar,spice, and everything nice."" But The Professor put in another thing. CHEMICAL X! Thus these three little girls with superpowers came out and fought evil in there city. The City of Townsville is always being under attack mostly by the evil monkey Mojo Jojo! In each episode the three girls (Blossum,Bubbles,and Buttercup) defeat Mojo Jojo. This movie however is a prequal to the show. A descripted story on how the girls where made and there first encounter with Mojo Jojo.
The Professor is looking to make people to help Townsville from crime. He makes The Powerpuff Girls. Everybody loves them. The kids at school love playing with them and everything is going good for them. Untill one boy teaches them the rules of the game tag. They play all over town and end up destroying it. All the citizens hate them. They go to school the next day but never get picked up that afternoon. The Professor was arrested. They walk home and meet Jojo. He is also hated because he has superpowers. The girls decide to help him build a machine to help Townsville. They don't know Jojo tricked them into making a machine to help Jojo rule the Earth forever. All goes according to plan and then Jojo decides to be named MOJO JOJO!
The three girls adventure in Townsville is great and I think that this movie should have made more money. I enjoyed it and the animation was great. I mildly enjoyed the mini cartoon at the beginning. Dexter's Labortory's Chicken Scratch. I think you should see Thw Powerpuff Girls movie. It's not just for girls or kids. It's fun for everybody!

But it was good.  It's about time that we actually see the whole day when Professor Utonium 'created' the girls and not just the shows introduction.  The animation is great, the sound is good and the story is very faithful to the show and vice versa.
It's fun for kids and even adults because of Bubbles' childish personality and Buttercup's rought and tough, sometimes sardonic attitude.  It's really great.  And also the Professor's relationship with the girls is very heartwarming.  It's good to see a vhild oriented movie with the message that everyone is special in their own way, not different, and it's just a matter of how you use your specialties that make you who you are.

Mojo is the one who added the checmical X, not the professor.  This little fib that the professor takes 100% credit has been going around for too long. It's time that everybody heard the truth.

Like the old Warner Brothers cartoons, the parodies, in-jokes, and cultural references are simply beyond them.
Unfortunately, this DVD is far from perfect.  It is available in fullscreen only, and its packaging is flimsy.  Were it not for the hilarious cast interviews and commentaries, this would be a 3-star product at best.",1037145600,2,578,4.989583333333333
1694811,5,B000063W2R,"This is a movie about how the Powerpuff Girls were born, and the events that transpired to make them the super-heroine saviors of their home, Townsville. The movie is an outstanding, brilliantly animated story with ""non-stop frentic action"" (which is why it is rated PG) that seems to parody the entire genre of super-hero comics. The good guys always win in the end, and the bad guys go straight to jail. One of my favorite things about the TV show is that they completely skip the judicial system. All of the bad guys go directly from crime to punishment. Each of the three main characters have a distinct attitude. And most anyone can identify with one of the girls. The movie shows us how the girls came into being, and how the antagonist for the television series came into being, and a bunch of other things that explain how the world of the Powerpuff girls television show came into being.
The animation is great. It was drawn mostly by hand, with the aid of computer graphics in a few spots. The music is an amazing combination of electronic and symphonic music that matches the moods of the movie perfectly. There are some good lessons in life in the movie for little girls, and the movie is power-packed with action and fighting for little boys to enjoy. And those of us who haven't forgotten how much fun it was to be a kid can really escape in to this fantasy world created by Craig McCracken. The story is a lot of fun and consistent with the television show stories (down to the last detail). And Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are the 3 cutest cartoon characters I have ever seen. The characters' drawings were based on the 60s posters of the little children with the huge eyes.
The one setback: no wide-screen version. Only full-screen. I wish they had more college students in the focus groups. Instead of a wide-screen version, they used the space on the DVD disk to put a feature-length director commentary, which was very interesting to watch. I really enjoyed hearing about director's thoughts as I watched the movie a second time. It also includes interviews with Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, and Mojo-Jojo and the Mayor of Townsville, which were really fun to watch (it added even more depth to the character's personalities).

1694814,2,B000063W2R,"Last summer's _Powerpuff Girls Movie_ was, hands down, the most interesting animated feature in years.  In terms of graphic design, it's the film UPA might have made, if it had had the chance.
Sadly, it was relegated to kid-flick purgatory and ignored by the public, which may explain why Warner Bros. has botched its DVD release.  Although the film's trailer is presented in widescreen, the film itself is not available in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Image cropping is noticeable, especially during split-screen sequences.
A nice round-up of extras doesn't help much under these circumstances.  Still, because I enjoyed the film so much in theaters, and because I think the animation is really good, I promise to rewrite this review and raise my rating once Warner Bros. releases it in widescreen.
For now, shame on Warner Bros.
Warning to parents: This film is extremely violent, and many of the visuals could be deeply disturbing.  As with the television series, the _PPG Movie_ is not for children.",1036713600,11,1009,5.054216867469879
1694815,5,B000063W2R,"I am 18 years old, yet the PPG cartoon is my 2nd fav Cartoon Cartoon behind Samurai Jack. (I hope they turn the upcoming live-action movie into an animated movie!) When I went to see the PPG movie in theaters, I also saw it with Hey Arnold and MiB II. The PPG movie was easily 100x better than the other two films. Some people complain that it's too dark and slow, but it's all good. For one, it's a movie, so the action has to be upped up to make an impact. As for the slowness, it allows us to really peek into the character's minds, and brings out a whole layer onto the girls in the show. Especially the asteroid scene, one of the best.
The animation is wonderful, except for one thing. It's FULLSCREEN! I have a small TV, but I HATE Fullscreen! Come on WB! Give us Widescreen! Anyway, as to the actual animation, it is wonderful. It may seem very simple, but it wasn't. If you listen to the commentary on the DVD, you will hear about how they had such a hard time animating the 2D (not 3D) backgrounds, and how the color palatte didn't like the animation computers they were using. I think the results are terrific. Everything is bright, crystal clear, and there are no blemishes whatsoever. And considering they only had $35 million and about a year, if that, to make the film, the results are very impressive.
The extras are sweet. Besides the aformentioned commentary, there's character interviews with Blossom, Bubbles, Buttercup, Mojo and the Mayor. Those five characters also add commentaries to certain scenes and each have their own charm. The Mayor gives little commentaries to a few other extras, such as the early screen test. Then there's the standards, such as the movie trailer, subtitles, etc. There's a sneek peek section, but it's on Dexter's new CD, the new PPG video game, the Kids Next Door, and what will most certainly be a crappy Ed, Edd, and Eddy video game. Overall, this is a must buy for PPG, and animation fans alike. Just demand that next time CN releases a film on TV, that they put it in widescreen.",1036713600,3,2035,4.5027027027027025

1694817,5,B000063W2R,"Normally, full-length features of TV series aren't as good as the original, even if they are done with the original actors.  Ditto for animated films.  The younger the audience, the more it will be geared towards them, which means it may have no substance.  There are a few exceptions, such as the adult-geared South Park, which outshone the series, and the subject of this review, the Powerpuff Girls Movie, which despite its youthful audience, has pop culture references that only adults might get.  And it isn't that long, clocking in at 73 minutes.  So my earlier assessment in a review may have been less than generous.
Basically, the early part of the movie dealing with their creation is a revised, extended retread of the episode ""Mr. Mojo's Rising.""  As I'm one for program continuity, I'm relieved it doesn't contradict the events in that story that much.  Fans can compare the two and come up with a firm origin story that dovetails.  But the bottom line is that Townsville is a haven for crime and lawlessness, and it is that backdrop in which Professor Utonium, that ""forward thinking man who looks back"" creates the trio.  The movie serves to explain how and why they became dedicated to fighting crime.
Blossom is so named because of her directness, Bubbles because she is cute and bubbly, and Buttercup because it also starts with a B, which may explain why she's such a grump at times.  Anyway, the first half hour, dealing with their super powers and the Professor's amazement and delight at what he's created, is clearly the happiest moment of the movie.
Then comes the Powerpuff Girls' idea of urban renewal, which is basically to--unintentionally, of course--tear the concrete jungle of Townsville, as well as their kindergarden, in a superpowered game of tag, which they learn from Mitch the bully.  The Professor is arrested for being partly responsible, and the girls are branded pariahs, before running into Jojo.  The four team up to create an invention that will save Townsville.  However, no thanks to Jojo, that invention turns out to be a device that reverses the existing primate hierarchy, and the girls' association with it further ruins their image in the eyes of the Townies and worse yet, the Professor.
The obvious pop culture references come from Planet Of The Apes and King Kong, be it dialogue or scenes.  However, the theme of xenophobia, fear of the unknown, is key here, as the Townies turn on the girls influenced by the usually distortion blitz committed by the media.  And the animation style and pace is taken to higher levels, especially the zappity-pow final battle, which is another point in having a feature-length film.
There are cameos from Fuzzy Lumpkins and the Gangreen Gang has a few moments, so that hints them as the key villains in a possible second movie, assuming McCracken and company decide to do another.  Which leads me to this:  The Powerpuff Girls Movie shouldn't have tanked at the box office.  Now the timing, that was the problem, as it ran into Men In Black II and Spiderman, which was still going strong at the box office.  However, video and DVD sales/rentals are the ultimate indicators of how good a movie was, so let's just see, shall we?
So girls, to quote Mojo, ""you did good, very good indeed.""  Oh, and you're all IT!  Gotcha!",1036540800,4,3307,4.807420494699647

1694851,4,B000063W2R,"""From the voice that brought you great lines such as 'The city of Townsville... is under attack' comes this menu to the ultra-deluxe Powerpuff Girls movie DVD"" enthuses the familiar voice of Tom Kenny, better known as the Narrator on the Powerpuff Girls.  And brother, I'd love to be able to tell you that this DVD lives up to that promise... but I've got to say, WHAT SELF-RESPECTING ""ULTRA-DELUXE"" DVD IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAN AND SCAN?!
There used to be a time when all theatrical motion picture DVDs were available *only* in their original, widescreen, theatrical aspect ratio.  No questions asked, no apologies made.  But clearly, Warner Brothers has decided that this DVD is strictly a release for children, and thus decided to eliminate those ""pesky black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen - and in the process a good chunk of the movie's picture along with them - because apparently kids are too dumb to realize that TVs and movie screens are different shapes!
But let me back up here a bit.  For anyone who's a fan of The Powerpuff Girls TV series, you'll know that this is so much more than a children's show.  Despite what the media, marketing, and critics would have you believe, the Powerpuff Girls are *not* the creation of some soulless corporate committee designed to sell a 'girl power' positive-role-model message to the Barbie set.  Oh no.  They were created by a talented up-and-coming animator named Craig McCracken because, well, he thought the idea of little girls with extreme superpowers was funny.  And over the years of the show's evolution and success, it has stayed true to its original intent: to be funny.
The Powerpuff Girls Movie is a shining example of a funny movie created by animators for animation fans.  Compared to the already-excellent TV series, the colours are more vibrant, the effects are more spectacular, the music just plain ROCKS (why isn't there a soundtrack available?!), and the action is truly a sight to behold... even on a TV screen in pan & scan format!  Which really honks me off because a movie with such striking visuals such as these deserves to have the whole picture on the screen.
Adding insult to injury are the deleted scenes, and practically all the clips used in the various DVD special features, that actually ARE presented in widescreen!  There are scenes where you can literally compare the two and see for yourself just how much of the feature's image is being cut off.  But hey, to see fully completed deleted scenes (minus only the sound effects) from an animated movie is not something you see every day and is a very nice touch!  Still, it would have been nice to have director Craig McCracken explain why these scenes ended up being cut in the first place.
Other special features like the interviews with the ""actors"", the director's and character's commentaries, and the test reel are all very nice features indeed.  Though I was disappointed by the single theatrical teaser trailer included.  If you spent any time at all watching Cartoon Network while this movie was in theatres, you no doubt saw some of the myriad cool promos that were made (check out the PPG movie promo feature at toonamiarsenal.com).  If they'd thrown even just a handful of the best ones on this DVD, I'd have been happy.
This was quite possibly my favourite movie of the year, and this shabby treatment on DVD is not only a slap in the face to the hardcore fans, but also to Mr. McCracken and the talented team at Cartoon Network Studios.  Warner Bros. may do stupid things like this sometimes, but they do occasionally listen to their customers.  We got the uncut version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, we're getting a special edition DVD of The Iron Giant pretty soon, and if we're vocal enough, we may just see a widescreen release of The Powerpuff Girls Movie.
4 stars still go out to this DVD just for being a wicked-cool movie.  And a fair amount of effort and care did go into the DVD's production and special features (except for the trailers).

If you didn't watch it in the theater, then buy it on VHS or DVD ""for the kids"". *wink*",1031184000,2,665,4.6923076923076925
1694856,5,B000063W2R,"... The PPG Movie is certainly no Like Mike.  Nor is it a Lilo and Stitch.  What we have here is a great ANIMATED feature of sumblime style and substance. There is no explicit cornball moral message that is stuffed into our faces.  Craig McCracken respects the minds of children enough to know that they will be able to see the moral lesson here for themselves.
The PPG have an annoying image of being a-cutesy-wootsy-Hello-Kitty-kids-only affair. ... Same point with The PPG: There is an exclusive level of enjoyment for open-minded mature minds to be found in the show and movie: pop culture reference, high style, pastiche, parody, all that post-modern stuff you hear about...  BR>And the movie brings all these qualities to a greater audience on a larger level.  Yes, this isn't some avant-garde groundbreaker...  This is sophistication of an enjoyable level. It can be called art...not because it is erudite or complex, or ironic and irreverent...no.  It is art the only way it should be:  effecting and beautiful...Beauty is truth, truth beauty.
 Yes, the film is less on humor and more on drama and plot...and these chraracters work much better on TV...but it all seems like a pygmy mouse when you see those radically vibrant images of an innocent rainbow striping the sky towards an egoist monkey with a huge brain or a huge chain of chimpanzees exploding...kids will clap, seniors will be rolling in the aisles (it's true, ive seen it) and you think, This is JUST a cartoon.  And it is, it is.  But it can be so much more.  Just try it.  I don't want to feed this to you.  Just give it a go.  Don't hate...Investigate!",1030838400,2,1627,4.719858156028369
1694877,5,B000063W2R,"I saw the Powerpuff movie while I was on vacation with my best friend and my cousins and my aunt. Everyone LOVED the movie. The Dexter short at the beginning was pretty dumb, but I'm willing to sit through it to watch the movie. Plus, it's more entertaining than five more preveiws. I see some parents think it is not good for children but please take into consideration what I have to say before deciding not to see it or take your kid to it because of a few parent's bad reviews (and keep in mind, some of them may be some teenagers who dislike the Powerpuff girls and are just causing trouble). The people I went to go see the movie with were [various]ages... ALL six of us enjoyed it and none of us thought it was 'too violent.' It was the perfect movie, it is one of my top favorites and I would take my little cousins and friends to it. The amount of violence that is in it is pretty much the same, or even less, then TV shows such as Power Rangers, Pokemon, or any other show a 3 year old or older likes. And there has to be some violence or it will turn out like a Barney movie.(the ending would have to be as exciting as ""excuse me, please stop trying to take over the world. Thank you!"") Mojo Jojo was by far the best bad guy to have appear in the movie. Also, about the Professor not punishing them for destroying Townsville: the PPGs were practically newborns! It's like putting a 3 year old with a baseball bat in a room of priceless vases and expecting him not to break anything. Anyway, the PowerPuff Girls is a GREAT movie for ALL ages. I highly recommend going to see it if at all possable! It was worth my money, I'm sure it will be worth yours! And when you go, stay more than ... only covers the tag game, and not even getting into the excitement.",1030752000,,1767,4.169590643274854
1694878,4,B000063W2R,"To be honest, I didn't know anything about ""Powerpuff Girls"" even though Cartoon Network can be seen also in Japan, and I happened to have seen American animation series like ""Flintstones"" there.  But they decided to release ""PPG: The Movie"" in theaters in Japan, so I went to see that.
And the film proved an unexpected joy; though the theater was not full of audience (actually very few), but the kids behind me were enjoying the film, and interestingly, parents too.  Even though the film has failed commercially to impress us (at the opening week the film reached only No. 9 in US box-office chart), those who showed up at the theater would come to love those wide-eyed cute girls, Blossom, Bubbles, and boyish Buttercup, without previuosly watching the original TV episodes.
In fact, the film is virtually ""Episode I"" of TV series that has been running more than three years, so non-die-hard ""PPG"" fans can easily enter the world of Townsville, where three super-girls (who still go to kindergarten) fight against evil ape Mojo Jojo.  The film introduces how the girls are born in the laboratory of Professor Utonium, with sugar and spice and everything nice (plus Chemical X), just as catchy 60s pop song goes.  There are regular characters that appear in the TV series (so I heard), but you don't have to know anything about them to enjoy the film.  Wise choice of moviemakers.
The film, as some have complained with some justification, is NOT for little kids and parents who seek for moral and message in animation films.  This film is not as outrageous as ""South Park"" but certainly it includes some violent contents, one of which is the total destruction of kindergarten and the city itself due to the girls' practical joke, and some child play that everyone knows.  But the girls just can't help it.
The story falters sometimes, especially in the first half; we all know that this weird green ape with a paper bag on his head must be a villain; we know that the professor, compared with those kids and bad monkeys, looks very insipid and boring.  But wait till the second half when everything gets into gear.  The last scene has rousing actions by the girls.
Director Craig McCracken gives a unique style of drawing and color, and about its designs only, the film is memorable.  And proabably he is a fan of Japanese animations, or at least he knows soething about it.  Fighting girls remind us Japanese ""Sailor Moon""; fighting and chasing (or mayham) on the street is a favorite device of Japanimation (like ""Urusei Yatsura""); or the idea of hero/heroine created by a doctor resembles the situation of classic anime ""Astro Boy,"" and so on.  Of course, these Japanese products owe much to American older animations, but his style itself is, in my eye, quite closer to Japanese counterpart, rather to Disney and Hannah Barbera's works.  That might explain my and other Japanese audience's joyful reaction to ""Powerpuff Girls.""
Anyway, if you or your kids want to see something with a bit more of edge, something spicier than ""Pokemon"" in watching animation, try it.  It is hard not to love those girls.",1029024000,5,3112,4.803370786516854
1694879,4,B000063W2R,"This movie was made for all people. You may never seen an episode of The Powerpuff girls, and still enjoy the film.
It's not only gor 6 year old girls. No!!, if you're like 48, you'll love it too!.
The girls: Blossom is the leader. She's strong enough and beautiful. Bubbles is the baby, she's more beautiful than her sisters but she's not that strong.
Butter-cup is the strongest one, but I think she's more pretty than the other two. She's my favourite.
Here she can't avoid saving a stupid dog that didn't let her to kick and punch that dirty apes.
The story is about the creation/origin of the girls, and how they tryied to live in a normal place, not using their super powers.
But, the girls are out of control and people start to hate them. So the bad ape Mojo Jojo makes his first evil plan to take over the world.
Animation is great. The action scenes of the movie are amazing. Explosions, destroyed buildings, apes and monkeys torturing people, and this 3 colored girls flying over the city, kicking some...
Craig McCraken did an excellent job. The drawings lokk great, the girls never looked so alive. What i didn't like about was the short episode of Dexter before the film.
It was dumb and boring, I just wanted to see the Powerpuff girls, not he and his hilarious sister, Dee Dee.
I was hoping that it kicked the box office. But it was  a disaster, nobody went to see the film.
In my country, people went crazy, and waiting in 2 hours line to get tickets for it. But of course, other kids movie like Ice age, Spirit or Lilo and Stich, and Stuart Little 2 did better.
But I can promise you that this film, is 100 better than all the others toghether.
It's non stop animated action, of 3 little beautiful and charming girls.

1694880,2,B000063W2R,"I've been waiting to see this movie for months!  I was ready to have a good time, but the powerpuff's let me down.  How could this happen?
Unfortunately the story is a prequel to the show detailing how the girls came to be and why they decided to fight crime.  Why is that bad?  Well the audinece it's most likely to see the movie watches the show regularly, and the show has already told us many of these details.  So I wound up sitting there waiting for something to surprise me, to offer something that I didn't already know.  Not only did that never happen, but I was subjected to 10 minutes of Bubbles crying!  Fight scens dragged on and on as did a game of tag.  it's like the writers couldn't think of wnything good so they just let the girls run amonk for 6 minutes.  The whole movie just felt like an over-long episode.  I was very disappointed.

1694882,5,B000063W2R,"First of all, I'd like to address the fact that this movie's target demographic was never, EVER intended to be small children. The show's creator and the movie's director, Craig McCracken, has himself said this on several occaisions. Yes, it was advertised in such a manner, but it wasn't Cartoon Network that supervised how the movie's promotion was conducted. Just thought I'd clear that up for the mother who posted a few reviews below me as well as anyone else who might be considering bringing their child to see the film.
Anyways, being a huge fan of the series for quite some time, I was really looking forward to this movie's release. I saw it as early as I could on the day of its premier, and I can't say that I was at all dissapointed. The movie, like the show, is chock full of media/pop culture references (one scene almost entirely composed of Van Halen references, and the scores of Planet of the Apes refs should be easy to spot towards the second half of the movie) and punny humor, most of which the little ones probably won't be able to pick up on. At the same time, though, there was a nice element of seriousness to some parts of the movie that would never be found in the series.
Lots of people would enjoy this film, and if you haven't already seen it, I really suggest you go and do so. It may not change your life, but it's certainly entertaining.",1027296000,,1372,4.426877470355731

Honestly, do you think that a town with monsters rampaging around would want heros who didn't take things a tad bit on the violent side? This movie just reflects our so called ""perfect"" world in ways that kids can understand.
Getting to the moral. The moral of the story , as they repeated many times, is that sometimes people don't understand how special you are and that you have to show people how special you are and let them take it or leave it.
If parents can't look past the violence and look deeper into the moral, I don't know what kind of kids we are raising.
My point is ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" because the story can be exciting and meaningful.",1027123200,,883,4.45679012345679
1694884,1,B000063W2R,"Why are they making children's movies that are PG-rated?  Do the people at Cartoon Network have no conscience whatsoever? This movie deserves zero stars.  It's an abomination.
I recently took my five-year-old and was incensed by the gratuitous violence and destruction -- the fact that the PPGs never faced any consequences for destroying a school and a town while ""playing tag.""  They were simply no longer popular because the people of Townsville misunderstood their ""specialness.""  Dad neglected to discipline them for their actions.
Is the rise of Mojo Jojo supposed to serve that purpose?  Does that mean that the adults have no authority to teach a lesson, but Mojo Jojo does?
And what's up with the buxom but beheaded Mayor's aide?  What kind of misogynist came up with that idea?
I have never written a review on Amazon before.  I do so now because I am so appalled at this awful movie.  I'm still kicking myself for not doing my homework before taking my child.  There is nothing powerful about these puff girls.  They send a dangerous message that you can wreak havoc on a community and get away with it.

And continues to detroy the town (as the girls play ""tag"") and the last half of the movie when the girls have to figure out how to kill of all the different apes they inadvertently set free.
You may wonder why we went to see this movie.  As a casual observer catching snippets of Power Puff cartoons, I thought they were a little rough but assumed there was some underlying moral to put the violence in context (turns out there isn't).

PpG, The Movie, felt more like a film for adult fans of animation, not small children. There is enough violence (and bodies) to maybe scare some very small children. But for the fans who are older, this film has it all. PpG, The Movie, gives the background to the origin story that the series alludes to, and, although short, is a great one-off adventure for the girls.
The animation was strong and the film moved at an excellent pace. The best part, though, I must say, was the score by James Venable. His work with the series is good, but the incidental music in the film has the perfect level of darkness and light to fit each scene. The breakbeat background in the Tron-like tag sequence was more energizing than any chase music I've heard in ages.

Some people do not understand that this is the prequel to the TV series, so of course it will not have all the villains in the movie. Craig McCracken wanted to balance out the film where fans of the show, and people who have never seen the PpG, can enjoy it. The movie is just like the TV series.
  I am happy to see that Craig did not make any improvements to the characters as other films do that go from TV to the big screen. He kept the characters the same as they are on the show. The animation is a little better.
  The movie makes references to such films ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Wizard OF Oz,"" and ""King Kong.""
My favorite scene is where the girls are playing tag in Townsville. The girls are having a ball playing tag around Townsville. They do not realize how rough they are playing and in the process, they are destroying the town.
  This film makes you laugh while other animated shows take themselves too seriously. The PpG reminds me of the Cartoons I used to watch when I was a kid. Cartoons like Atom Ant, The Beatles Cartoons, Spider-Man, Top Cat, the Impossibles, and the campy 1966 Batman TV series.
  It is not only the animation that makes the movie great; it is also the talents of the voiceover actors that bring the characters to life. E.G. Daily, Tara Strong, Cathy Cavadini, and the rest of the cast make these characters laughable, loveable, and believable. Everyone has done an excellent job on this movie.
  I hope Cartoon Network and Warner Brothers decide not to get rid of the cast of this fine and unique series. The show will lose many fans if CN and WB do decide to get a new cast. The cast was almost replaced before the voices were recorded for the movie. CN and WB did not want to pay the cast all the money that the cast were supposed to get for the TV series, the movie, and the PpG merchandise. I am happy to hear that things worked out for the film.
  I was not disappointed with the PpG movie. I love the show more now after seeing the movie. I plan to see it again. I cannot wait of this movie on DVD.

This movie tells the story of the Girls' origin, and (not coincidentally) that of their chief nemesis; evil-genius superchimp Mojo Jojo. A good introduction for viewers previously unfamiliar with the large-eyed trio, a more detailed recap for those in the know, and a visual feast for anyone. The artwork is a thick-lined but vigourous hybrid of Western and Japanese style animation (so much for 'never the twain shall meet'), with a dash of CGI thrown in. The voice characterizations are flawless, particularly Roger L. Jackson's basso profondo, which renders Mojo, by turns, convincingly poignant and genuinely menacing. The action sequences frequently fill the screen to the point of bursting, and yes, there are a couple scary moments (though no worst than what any Disney feature includes.)

In the short time we were at the theater, there was no story. It was basically the Powerpuff girls running around like they were on speed. I think the geniuses who put this movie out figured there wasn't a need for a real story because the kids just wanted to see the girls. Great thinking.

Nevertheless the film still manages to work on mulitple levels so adults will enjoy this as much as older kids.
Any child over the age of 6 or 7 should be able to appreciate the themes of rejection and being ""different"". The way they are utilized throughout the story adds depth to the film. I felt, though, that the film lacked much of the humor and charm of the television series. When the girls hit the big screen, the story takes a far too serious turn early on.
