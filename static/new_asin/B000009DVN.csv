7905353,3,B000009DVN,"Godfrey Ho's reputation as Hong Kong's premier shlockmaster is all the more disappointing when you consider that he could actually make an entertaining movie when the mood struck him. ""Angel Enforcers"" is an example of this: it's occasionally weird and clumsy, but it's rarely boring, often exciting, and just barely misses a four star rating. This one's fallen into obscurity but should still be able to find some love among fans of Ho's more famous efforts like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undefeatable/dp/B0024F08FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undefeatable</a>.

The story: A police unit led headed by four female officers pits itself against a cartel of diamond thieves and the aggression of a vengeful assassin (Dick Wei,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Madam/dp/6305235155/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes, Madam!</a>).

This is very much a representative of the ""girls with guns"" subgenre and is a pretty good vehicle for prominently-placed leads Pan Pan Yeung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Terminators/dp/B00GT2IVLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Terminators</a>) and Ha Chi Jan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eastern-Condors/dp/B0000TPA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eastern Condors</a>). It's a pretty low budget movie - note the abundance of handheld camerawork, unconvincing effects, and soundtrack segments lifted from other movies - but remains interesting by making use of its creative freedom. You'll find a decent amount of intriguing characters (e.g. the kingpin played by Siu Wong Fong), plenty of weird dialogue (""Place your soul in this incense, and we'll visit grandma together""), and even some weird tidbits that defy rational explanation (e.g. exploding flowers).

The action content is uneven, with the latter half of the film definitely boasting more than the first. It's a fairly even balance of fights and bullet ballet, and in regard to the latter, it bears mentioning that the police in this film suffer some of the highest casualties I've ever seen in a Hong Kong picture. There are eight full-length fights, and at best, they're pretty good - a little heavy on flips and falls requiring doubling, but otherwise, they're not bad. Ho's tactic of making the villains much stronger than even the lead protagonists is an unconventionally welcome change of pace and gives the final battle a genuinely tense mood. Also, while most of the stuntwork isn't anything out of the ordinary, there's an absolutely heart-stopping instance wherein Ridley Tsui (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Annihilation/dp/B004MA1K12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a>) falls off a bridge, hits the edge of a moving truck, and falls onto a moving van - respect!

The film has an occasionally nasty side that flairs up when once Dick Wei actively begins seeking revenge for his slain comrade, but overall, the tone is pretty hammy. If you're a fan of the work of Cynthia Khan and especially Moon Lee, you will probably enjoy this more than if your standard is more along the lines of Michelle Yeoh. Nevertheless, it's more likely than anything that action fans will indeed enjoy it to *some* degree, so check it out if you can find it for a reasonable price.",1430611200,,3413,6.209302325581396
