8371361,4,B002JCSOA0,"Get out your paint and palette knives...five colors plus white, two knives, one brush and paint along.  This is slow and rather detailed so you can finish your own painting while you watch.  I'm personally not fond of the ""colors"" but the video is great in terms of the use of values and a paint knife for a seascape.  I would recommend it, have fun.",1331424000,,350,4.3538461538461535
