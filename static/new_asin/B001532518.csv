8257216,5,B001532518,This DVD is one of the best videos of Cozumel I have ever seen. We have been going there for over 20 years and I have never seen a video describe Cozumel so truthfully. You did an excellent job. Keep up the good work. I prefer to dive with Aldora Divers and highly recommend them. They cater to your needs and are very safety conscious.,1288310400,,336,4.184615384615385
8257217,5,B001532518,"I wish I had had this DVD before my first trip to Cozumel.  It has incredible coverage of the dive sites and great video footage as well as topside tourist info and island history.

For every site you get a detailed description of the dive, its difficulty, and get to see the sights first hand.  It definitely arms you to make your next trip the best yet.  I'd recommend that any Carribean diver and this disc to their collection.",1206316800,,430,4.405063291139241
8257218,5,B001532518,"I've watched the DVD multiple times now and I'm amazed by the amount of high quality, as well as detailed, information.

If you've never been to Cozumel, after watching this DVD you would know everything you would need to in order to plan a great vacation there.  I really enjoyed the coverage on the hotels, restaurants, overview of the island and of course the diving.

All of the information would have been especially useful my first couple of times to the island, but the detailed information on each of the dive sites will be used as a reference for a long time to come.

I have never seen a dive video or book that provides so much information on the dive sites.  There is extensive video of each of the many popular sites and as well as the graphics/slides that show the underwater topography at each, as well as the quality of the coral and fish populations, etc...

This is clearly a very thorough, analytical, and well done travel video.  And for this price I would certainly buy future titles in the series.  It is one thousand times better than the dive/travel books I've purchased at scuba shops before.

I love it!  Good job DiveScape!  I'm a fan.  What's next?",1205625600,,1176,4.5476190476190474
