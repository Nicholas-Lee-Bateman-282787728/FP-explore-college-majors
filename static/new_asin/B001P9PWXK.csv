3744283,5,B001P9PWXK,Love the recording and video quality. It makes you feel as if you are there live with the artist. Please send me your latest Dvd listings of this type of music concerts.,1243123200,,169,4.3125
3744284,5,B001P9PWXK,I have been looking for the Montreux DVD for some time and was pleased to find a copy in new condition.  The DVD is outstanding,1239580800,,127,4.08
3744285,4,B001P9PWXK,"I like David Sanborn, but I'll be honest, I bought this because it features the late, great Hiram Bullock on guitar, of whom there isn't much performance video available anywhere.

The band is hot - Sanborn is great - but Hiram steals much of the show - barefoot dancing and hot playing.

I was also exicted to see that several tracks feature Robben Ford on guitar, but he doesn't get much of a chance to solo and is actually gratingly out of tune on one song intro though I'd chalk that up to the pre-historic monitoring systems of nearly 40 years ago.

Rest in peace Mr Bullock!",1239408000,9,580,4.401869158878505

8332671,3,B001P9PWXK,I am a long time David Sanborn fan and especially his early work.  I have been disappointed in his live concerts where he does not connect well with the audience.  This performance is musically very good but his bandmates are jumping around on stage in a distracting way.  Not fun to watch.,1319328000,,290,4.538461538461538
8332672,5,B001P9PWXK,"Every Sanborn fans collection is not complete without this DVD.  David is backed by a great band and shows us, even 26 years later why he IS one of THE best alto saxophone players on the planet bar none.  His playing is flawless, his songs are wonderful to listen too, the DVD is vivid and clear, almost as if you're at the concert.  A nice special treat included is the Rickie Lee Jones rendition of Autumn Leaves (as a ballad) which was nice to hear Sanborn play jazz.  As of all that isn't enough, the PRICE IS RIGHT.. $13.49 plus FREE Shipping.  Get this for your library while supplies last!  Highly recommended for all Sanborn enthusiasts and fans!",1294185600,4,654,4.5
8332673,5,B001P9PWXK,"I'm a huge Sanborn fan & he can do no wrong & watching this 20 odd year old performance was simply awesome. Probably a bit of bias on my part but when you're a master, you're a master! J As a huge Jazz sax fan, i'll recommend this DVD anyday!!",1247011200,3,243,3.88
