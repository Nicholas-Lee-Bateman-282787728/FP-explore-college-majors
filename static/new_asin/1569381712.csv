8578948,5,1569381712,"This documentary does a great job of remaining objective while following a family (a mob) of kangaroos.  Focus centers on a few kangaroos which the narrator names (Jaffa, Sunshade, etc.).  There's drama and we feel for the kangaroos, and it doesn't seem like the drama was artificially created.  It really feels like a year in the life of a mob of kangaroos.  It's the only documentary I've enjoyed enough to buy.",982108800,8,413,4.774647887323944
