8423622,4,B004CTHD0A,"I bought a package of NRA SHOOTING SPORTS games including xtreme accuracy shooting, High Power Competition, and Varmitt shooter. I have been an avid gun collector and shooter for years, but never taken part in competion shooting with the NRA or CMP.. I saw this package when I was looking for books on NRA or CMP Rules and thought hey! this will be a fun way to learn the rules and may help me remember some of the finer aspects of Competition shooting. Like a chess game program I have that really taught me a lot and greatly improved my game, I thought, this might work. The packaging and information are exciting the instructions and system requirements are very reasonable. Accept, that I have a windows 7 home premium operating system and I can't as yet get it to load.  So... if you have a similar system... research how to load on your computer first. Not like I did. I'll call the company tomarrow, talk to my computer guy and see if their is a way around this. Last resort will be upgrading an old xp computer I have so that it will run the software.  I really want to use these games to learn and have fun!  Best of luck  Maq",1336780800,,1135,4.339622641509434
