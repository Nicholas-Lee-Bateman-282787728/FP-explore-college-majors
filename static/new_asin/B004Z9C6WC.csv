8449560,5,B004Z9C6WC,This was a fun project to be apart of. It is a fun gory little tale any horror fan would enjoy! Support your independent film makers!,1469318400,,133,4.153846153846154
8449561,4,B004Z9C6WC,When I first started watching Bianca I thought what is this? Then as the story progressed I found myself drawn in.  I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  Kimberly did a phenomenal job with Bianca's voice.  Great job ditching the accent! :)  Tom Steeber does a great job also.  Somehow everything in this film comes together and works in a way that was much better than I could have anticipated. Great job to every one.,1312416000,,440,4.45

Not really a cartoon,More a surreal combo of film mediums to exploit a stories conclusion.
When your star is a fashion doll, So as not to offend the BARBIE collectors and groupies.
This story is pretty incredible,Well let us say it is credible IF everyone in the situation was human and 2D ?
Steeber is also the director and writer and at times you're thinking,Is this HARVEY PEKAR like or one of TIM BURTONS acid trips...Maybe if ANDY WARHOL had been able to enter the digital age ?
Almost felt sorry for Bianca and yet understood,""Umm ""if one can make such a statement and have some semblance of a normal life ?
Cant wait to see festivals try to label this film,Good Luck Judges and maybe HORROR is best category.",1306195200,,738,4.556390977443609
