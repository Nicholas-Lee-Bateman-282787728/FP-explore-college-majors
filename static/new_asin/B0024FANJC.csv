8350589,5,B0024FANJC,"Dolly Parton sat down with Morley Safer to do a sit-down interview on ""60 Minutes"" back in April, 2009 in order to publicize the debut of ""9 to 5-The Musical"" on Broadway. For those who think this DVD release contains portions of the interview that didn't air on the telecast, they will be disappointed: the interview is the same as what aired on CBS and the total running time is only 12 minutes long. So, if you already have this interview taped on VHS or DVD, save your money, but if your an ardent Dolly follower who has to have everything she has appeared on buy this disc.
 The interview itself is quite touching as Dolly discusses her growing-up years in Tennessee, her rise to superstardom, the cosmetic surgeries she's had, and most emotionally her love of her parents whom she lost a few years back. Here for the first time on tape Dolly actually becomes emotional as a tape of her parents is played for her. She tries to hold back the tears, but to no avail she cannot. It's heartbreaking when you hear Dolly say"" that's Momma!"" in her little girl voice. The tape of Dolly's parents is from Dolly's rarely seen 1976 syndicated TV series.
 The interview itself was taped at Dollywood.",1279584000,,1194,4.5488372093023255

It was brand new, sealed and not a copy, but for the money I expected a little more and by the description it sounded as though it was a full hour.  Great footage and a great interviw.",1273104000,,265,4.196078431372549
8350591,1,B0024FANJC,"VERY disappointed...

Because the name is 60 min I figured this DVD would be a full hour of info about Dolly Parton. I'm very annoyed I paid so much for a 12 min program.",1271894400,3,170,4.0
