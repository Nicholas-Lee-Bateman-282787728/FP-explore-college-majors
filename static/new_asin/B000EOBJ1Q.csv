2524471,5,B000EOBJ1Q,"I bought this DVD and I have to say that if you are a big fan of The Lord of the Rings, this DVD must be part of your collection.
The music is beautiful, wonderful.. You can listen every little sound, every musical instrument.  Also, while you're watching the symphony, you will enjoy wonderfull drawings by Alan Lee and small interviews with Howerd Shore.",1351382400,,356,4.5625
2524472,5,B000EOBJ1Q,"The ratings for this dvd seem to divide according to whether one wants an introduction or demands the whole thing and more. I have seen the films and have listened to my 3 cd set of soundtrack music. Never having had a chance to hear the symphony, I was very pleased with this as an introduction.
I just watched the whole thing again. Obviously at 52 minutes nobody is going to get all of the favorite selections. But it introduces some thoughts on instrumentation and repetition of themes, also comments on some of the melodic streams Shore planned for effect. Small sample: Hobbiton is introduced with a toy whistle at first, but elevates to a flute when the adventurers return home.
It is slammed for being shallow, but is at a reasonable level for the general public. There are passages long enough to get a good taste of the symphony.
I was pleased with the account of using Tolkein's created languages in the choral sections.
The books, the films, and the various versions of soundtrack music will provide the enthusiast years of happy hunting. But, golly heck, wanting the whole thing with out takes and variations on dvd just isn't going to happen. Soundtracks take years to really catch on in many cases. That's why so many are listed at astronomical prices in after market listings.
Don't pay more than a bit for this. It is 52 minutes, hmmm, was there more music than that? If you can get by with a reasonably simple overview with a few really nice musical gems, get it. If you are bloddy serious, spend $40 to $100 for other materials that are out there.
After two days of rehersals Shore conducted a massive group at Montreal. School children were included among the choral groups. Some solo players were very talented. Watch the violinist.
This is far, far better than nothing, but very short of everything. But, the 52 minute screen time rather hints that. If you have the cash and enough curiosity this snippet will cause you to find more. Enjoy.",1343779200,5,1962,4.6570605187319885
2524473,5,B000EOBJ1Q,Love everything about The Lord of the Rings and this music DVD is no exception.  Order was received very quickly  and has been viewed many times.  Thank you.,1298764800,,157,4.535714285714286
2524474,5,B000EOBJ1Q,"This DVD brings to life Tolkiens world of The Lord of the Rings through the beautiful, etherial music of Howard Shore's scores of Peter Jackson's movie trilogy ... the music is played flawlessly, and it is such a wonderful treat to see Howard Shore directing his beloved music ... a ""must have"" for all fans of the movies and music!",1288742400,,332,4.55
2524475,2,B000EOBJ1Q,"There is very little ABOUT the writing or preparation of this music. Instead, Howard Shore, sounding heavily medicated, tells us (or reads to us?) what each piece of music is about and he says that LotR is a beloved piece of literature. Thanks Howard, it's about time somebody noticed that... ho hum...

He gives no more insight into the creative process than any lighting technician or gaffer could have done.

Contrary to somebody else's review, all the music is NOT here by a long stretch. This isn't the full concert and even the full concert did not contain all the music composed for these films.

Sorry to say that I wasn't even blown away by the musical performances.

Overall a disappointment. I'm not sure why I'm giving it two stars instead of the minimum-allowed one star. Probably out of recognition of the overall artistic achievement of this series of films. I'm still awestruck by the sheer scope of the project.",1256774400,2,928,4.78125
2524476,3,B000EOBJ1Q,"As Richard from Texas very accurately stated, this is NOT the complete symphony.  I don't know why you would offer a ""making of"" and not release the actual music.  I heard the LOTR Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl, and it contains music that is NOT in the movie or on the 4 or 5 soundtrack CDs. In particular, there is one part, the Lost Glory of Moria, written for 8 part men's chorus, that is simply fantastic.  I am still waiting, 5+ years later, to find a recording of this music.",1199404800,13,482,4.274725274725275
2524477,2,B000EOBJ1Q,"The images on the front and back covers suggest a celebration of the music, but this DVD is NOT a recording of the two-hour concert.  Rather, it is a 52-minute documentary that offers tantalizing fragments of his symphony interspersed with Shore discussing various aspects of this work (i.e., ""A Composer's Journey Through Middle-earth"" -- as the cover says...in small type).  ""Tantalizing"" is the right word, as this viewer was left wanting a whole lot more.  So, let the buyer beware!
Hopefully the entire 6-movement symphony will appear on DVD soon...",1196121600,2,554,5.133333333333334
2524478,5,B000EOBJ1Q,"I bought the 4-disc set of the Return of the King at Target, and it came with this 5th DVD, a documentary on the making of the music behind the trilogy.  The DVD is well done, and makes the good choice of having more music than speaking.  All the tunes from the trilogy are in here, both the orchestral music, and those with words by Enya and other artists.  The DVD shows the people behind the music, both the composers, technical crew, musicians, and singers.  Overall, a great complement to the movies themselves.",1158537600,9,516,4.516129032258065
2524479,4,B000EOBJ1Q,"This DVD, is in some way... one of the best results from the Peter Jackson's Movies; the music from Lord of the Rings is a master piece; no doubt about it. and this is a resume, a very good one. I give it 4 stars becouse the only thing i miss was MORE! MORE MUSIC!

Creating the Lord of the Rings Symphony, is the best way for those whom have no chance to see the Symphony in our own cities (or countrys)...",1147910400,3,407,3.9634146341463414

8111878,3,B000EOBJ1Q,"Why is there no DVD of the complete performance of the work by this Montreal orchestra, especially since it seems likely that the entire concert was filmed? Or by some other orchestra? Surely there is a demand for such a DVD. The music often gets going, only to be interrupted by some comment by composer Shore, who looks like he is reading a script off a teleprompter.",1398556800,,369,4.522388059701493

8111881,4,B000EOBJ1Q,"Let me state first the positive reasons I gave this DVD 4 stars and then the one negative that kept it from getting 5 stars.

Positives:

1) Howard Shore is a musical genius and the guy did for LOTR (and is doing it for the Hobbit series too) what John Williams has done for Star Wars and that's to give depth and substance to a fictional world through the blessing of music.  Howard Shore made us believe this is what Middle Earth feels like through music.  Plus, giving us some insight into his thought process and how he connected the books with the movies and the movies to the fans through this beautiful music is just great to be privy to in my book.

2) Just ""experiencing"" the music played ""live"" is a real treat (even though this is not the full concert score but just select pieces).  Something about a live performance gives a sense of newness and spontaneity that you just don't get with a studio recording.  I regret terribly that I missed the chance to see this live when it toured originally, but, frankly, this is the third best thing (next after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-audio-CD-recording-of-the-entire-concert/dp/B005FNJL7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the audio CD/recording of the entire concert</a>) if you want to get some sense of being there.  When the final notes were played, I wanted to stand up in my living room and applaud along with the audience.  Howard Shore deserves every last bit of praise he gets about the LOTR music...and this DVD puts us, the fans, right on the front lines of him showing us once again why he was the perfect choice to give Middle Earth its musical heritage.

Every one of these 4 stars is quite simply due to the fact that capturing these small pieces of the live performance of the music was just plain cool and worthwhile.

Ok...so, my one negative.

It was rather obvious that a good deal of the ""interview"" footage of Howard was nothing more than him reading word-for-word a script.  I was really disappointed in that portion of the DVD because there are sections (it seems mostly right at the beginning and again at the end) where he is simply expressing his thoughts very fluidly and honestly in a completely non-scripted way.  The difference is quite noticeable.  I'm sure there were reasons for doing this, but it made Shore come off in his spoken segments as being stiff and almost dispassionate about something that I know, having seen a number of interviews with him about this music, he is deeply passionate about and not at all afraid to share his thoughts about it.  And frankly, the information wasn't terribly interesting or insightful into the journey to create the various pieces with the overall score...and topping that off with a bad delivery of that information just made it so much worse.  So...for that...I'm knocking off a star because it really does seem to take away from the rest of this well done DVD documentary.  If you want real insight into the creation of the score, pop in the DVD appendices with the Special Extended Edition of the movies.  Much, much better.",1358467200,,3106,4.859582542694497
8111882,5,B000EOBJ1Q,"Very Good ! My son just loved this DVD. He was looking for more Tolkien stuff and just come across this one.
