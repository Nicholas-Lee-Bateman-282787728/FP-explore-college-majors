I watched the whole thing asking myself, ""So, what's the point?  What's the point?  Where is this movie going?""  And at the end of the movie, I was still asking myself, ""What was the point?""

Only after I read the editorial review on Amazon.com, which provided the necessary background to understand the movie, did it make sense.  Unfortunately, the movie provided none of that background.  A good movie would have.",1238112000,,635,6.067415730337078
8001092,5,B0000DIC7D,"I like the earlier works of Miklos Jancso, and I believe that this is one of his best films. This was the first Jancso movie where his traditional long takes were first developed and perfected. Jancso teemed up with a fresh-out-of-school cinematographer, who was just as eager to break with traditional filmmaking. Indeed the end result is mesmerizing cinematography. Even if you don't get the complex story at your first viewing the movie still leaves with a great impact. If you want to learn about cinema techniques you must see this film.",1088812800,5,542,4.9021739130434785
8001093,5,B0000DIC7D,"""Silence and Cry"" is easily one of Miklos Jancso's best works. Anything from his 1960s period is great work of art, and ""Silence and Cry"" is no exception. The film is full of long sequences in which the choreography of both the actors' and the camera's movement is simply amazing. The DVD has rare extra features like the short documentary trilogy ""The Presence"". It also has a full director's filmography, listing all of Jancso's work, including early short films and television productions. It's a real bargain under $25 bucks, considering that similar DVDs from Criterion or Image cost a lot more. Highly recommended.",1066003200,11,620,5.029126213592233
