8379568,5,B002SSR8FW,"For me, the best BellyDance DVD for intermediate and beginner.
It is not really like others, difficult to explain why... But we can feel the passion and get the motivation in it.
The movements are correctly described, we can clearly see them. The teacher explain the main common errors. Ok, for this part, you can think that it is like all other DVDs. But she's really graceful like egyptian bellydancers are.
So if you are looking for something more than only pure technique, a little something from Egypt, original bellydance: get it!",1426377600,,536,4.836956521739131
8379569,4,B002SSR8FW,I really enjoy Princess Farhana's videos. She is easy to follow and explains the moves well. A good set of videos for the beginner or intermediate dancer,1376524800,2,153,4.703703703703703

This is a product for the beginning dance student.  If you are a beginning beginner, an intermediate beginner, or an advanced beginner, sure, add this dual pack to your collection. Learn all you can.  Especially from the Greats.

If you don't know where to start with Belly Flutters and Rolls, get this.  No matter your level of dance - just get it.  That is why I made the purchase.  If you already have a good start w/flutters and roll and are intermediate/advance Middle Eastern dancers, you may  want to still make this purchase for the stellar performance.
