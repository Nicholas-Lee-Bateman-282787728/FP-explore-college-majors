8733505,5,B015GNOW3Q,"This is a great set for the Amos and Andy fan.  The picture and sound quality on each DVD is fantastic. I tried watching similar videos online for the lost episodes and they pale in comparison to the video quality of this DVD set.

I don't understand the negative reviews for this set.  Clearly they bought copies from a different seller or an entirely different set.  Make sure you buy the leather-bound set to get the quality episodes.",1532563200,,437,4.564102564102564
8733506,1,B015GNOW3Q,"This set is really the worst of the worst.

That said, all Amos n Andy DVDs offered for sale are bootlegs.  There has never been any authorized sales by CBS, the copyright holder on all Amos n Andy materials produced post 1948.  The only source for complete shows are 16mm film syndication copies held by private collectors.

In the mid 1980s I assisted The Nostalgia Merchant in locating several 16mm film copies when they brought out their two VHS and Betamax volumes of Amos n Andy shows.  The films were transferred to 1 videotape using Rank Cintel flying spot scanners, then the state of the art in film to tape transfer.  I only mention this because I see that five of these transfers are now part of this digitally remastered collection, copied from thirty year old VHS tapes!

EVERYTHING in this collection is from some other sources VHS tapes.  EVERYTHING in this collection is available on youtube, the exact same episodes with the exact same problems in the exact same place, the only difference is the they are free.  To charge $199.00 for this set is ridiculous nearly to the point of being criminal.  The so-called lost episodes in this set are also on youtube.

And these are not professionally produced DVDs, they are rather DVD-Rs.  And the errors abound.  Five disks had one episode each that would not play.  Disk five was EXACTLY the same as disk 4, only the label was different, so another four shows were missing from this set.

I only kept this long enough to verify the problems with the disks then back to amazon.com for a refund of my $199.00 please do yourself a favor and avoid this.

Everything can be seen for free on youtube, or if you wish to buy the DVDs, look into one of the other sets on amazon that cost about  of this set, and have the same poor quality copies.",1522627200,,1799,4.537267080745342
8733507,4,B015GNOW3Q,"I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but this show is one of the classics of television, and I like it more than modern day comedy shows.

8733508,5,B015GNOW3Q,"This series, removed from television by misguided and those with an agenda, is an absolute composite of human problems, frailities and issues that we have to face everyday. Within this series is a heretofore unknown humanity and simple exposition of getting into and out of everyday problems.
This product is an absolute masterpiece. The remastering of the episode from the original kinescope renderings is awesome.
What a gift of truth to a generation that has no compass, grounding or beliefs.
Get this and revel in  the glories of what true civilization is!",1491264000,5,560,5.086956521739131
8733509,5,B015GNOW3Q,"I received this as a gift.  The video and audio quality on this DVD set is truly remarkable.  Having been a fan of this show since I was a kid I am delighted to finally be able to watch the series again with clear picture and sound.  I have seen other dvd collections of Amos and Andy that cost less, however the quality of the video and audio is not even close.  If you are an Amos & Andy fan and want the complete series this is the only one to consider; great packaging, CD of nostalgic radio shows, and a book containing a history of the series makes this collection a great value.",1481846400,3,585,4.105263157894737
