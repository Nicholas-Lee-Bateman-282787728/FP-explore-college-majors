3550081,5,B001EDFSIQ,"If you are a fan of Hunter S. Thompson you will love this movie.

The archival footage is extraordinary,and the interviews are great.  Johnny Depp does top notch narration as Hunter.

By the end of this movie, you really get a feel for the man that was Hunter S. Thompson.  This was a very deep and moving experience.

Even the soundtrack is flawless!(CCR, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, etc...)

  The special features are also superb, with commentary, a music video,audio excerpts,extended interviews,deleted scenes, all the ""gonzo"" art,and even a photo gallery, plus more.

If you like Hunter, then this is a no-brainer purchase.

I plan to also buy the soundtrack,audio tapes,and books.

Happy ""Gonzo"" watching.",1227139200,8,721,5.129310344827586
3550082,4,B001EDFSIQ,"On February 20, 2005, the end of an era was blown out not with a whisper but with a bang. Dr. Hunter S. Thompson chose that day to end his own life by committing suicide with one of the many guns he owned. It was a loss for a generation that grew up reading him in Rolling Stone Magazine, a loss for fans and a loss for journalism.

While two films (WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS) were made about his life, it is only now that Hunter reaches the screen in his own words, in his own actions via the newly released documentary GONZO: THE LIFE AND WORK OF DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON. And what a treat it is to see and hear him speak for himself.

The film looks back at the entire life of this maverick that changed the face of journalism by making it not just about looking at issues from the outside in, but from the inside out. Gonzo journalism often placed the writer into the scene of what was being written about since that writer was actually there. Gonzo journalists write as participants as opposed to voyeurs. And Hunter was a definite participant.

The film begins with his youth covering the usual biopic necessities of what possibly made him choose the direction he did. But it moves forward to his youth when he chose to be a writer and pursue that dream. Not only did he pursue it, he got involved in it.

The first break Hunter found was when he commingled with the motorcycle gang the Hells Angels to find out just what they were all about. The pieces he put together on the gang were wrapped up into a book titled HELLS ANGELS that was considered the quintessential source of information on gangs. A falling out with the gang led to Hunter's moving on to another topic.

Those topics were wide in range but always confronted with the brutal honesty as seen through the eyes of Thompson. Be it the Democratic convention in Chicago where the peace and love generation was beaten down by those in power or the great American dream demolished in his eyes as the city of Las Vegas, Hunter took typewriter ink to paper and using wit and a skewered sense of words defined the world for his generation.

Hunter's involvement in politics is shown ranging from his own run as sheriff of Aspen to his following the campaign trail in 1972 elections. Having been alive to witness the end of an era with the assassinations of both Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, Hunter found hope in the form of George McGovern. But that was never to be.

But all things change. And this is where the truly sad part of the story of Hunter S. Thompson slopes downward.  The involvement with drugs and alcohol combined with the glory brought on by celebrity status took its toll on Thompson. No longer able to blend in without being recognized his ability to cover a story changed as did his life.

The movie is an examination of a writer whose works are still read today. The director uses interviews with people who knew Hunter intimately like his wives, son and business partner to those who got to know him while he covered their stories. Sonny Barger of the Hells Angels, Ralph Steadman, George McGovern, Jimmy Carter, Pat Buchanan, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone and more all find screen time discussing this amazing author. Each has their own personal vision of who Hunter was and how he affected them.

What we are left with is the story of a man who wanted to change the world only to have the world change him. In some ways for the better, but not always. The words of Thompson describing flying bats and lizard people during hallucinogenic experiences were perhaps nowhere near as frightening as the real life demons he confronted as his life changed. Perhaps it was one of those demons that urged him on to commit the final deed of his life.

What one walks away with after watching this film is perhaps a little more understanding of the man. Perhaps you walk away with an interest in finding those items that he wrote. But more than anything you walk away with a feeling of loss at never having appreciated him to his full extent while he was here with us. A dynamite film that informs, entertains and shines a light on a true talent.",1226966400,47,4159,4.466403162055336
3550083,3,B001EDFSIQ,"This is a little like a better than average ""A&E Biography"" episode, and it hits most of the important notes, but ""Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson"" never really ignites or explodes in the unique ways that a great or even excellent documentary should.

We get talking head interviews. We get scads of photographs and old footage. There are re-enactments which are occasionally clever. Johnny Depp reads the writings (and while it struck me as redundant that the man who played Thompson onscreen is back to basically do it again, he knows the music well enough). The old friends weigh in and seem glad to be part of the club.

And above all the director works a little of the way into the obvious but overwhelmingly valid notion that the persona that made Thompson eventually melted him down. The movie does its job. Fair enough.

But the only real charge I got out of ""Gonzo"" was seeing the rare clips of Thompson appearing on a 1960's public debate program as well as the old game show ""To Tell The Truth."" The author, caught before the genius or the fermentation started and looking like a mere kid, seems shy but sly and I'll enjoy seeing the entire broadcasts if they're included on the DVD.",1226620800,,1213,4.580645161290323

3550169,5,B001EDFSIQ,"This movie has been well reviewed by others so just a couple of points that struck me. Firstly, as noted above, this movie has a wonderful soundtrack. At last half the story is told by the music that accompanies it. It also paints a vivid picture of Thompson. He is shown as a man that weeps for the brutalities of the world, and savages those that commit them like no one else can. I've loved him for that ever since I was first given a copy of Fear and Loathing. He's also a man who hunts wild pigs with a machine gun and tortures his pet bird. He abuses his wifes trust and abdicates his relationship with his child. He's like a lot of romantic heroes, in fact. A lot of people seemed to really love him.

3550194,5,B001EDFSIQ,"This is a warts-and-all documentary of one of the most important American journalists of the twentieth century. Well worth a look. Hunter's writings are spoken by Johnny Depp.

On Election Night 1972 when George McGovern went down to defeat at the hands of Dick Nixon, Hunter Thompson was also a man defeated - bitterly so. Here is how he concluded his book on the '72 Campaign:

""The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes and all his imprecise talk about 'new politics' and 'honesty in government' is one of the few men who've run for President of the United States in this century who really understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon.""

On February 20, 2005, at his home in Woody Creek, Colorado, Hunter Thompson pointed a gun to his head and ended his life. Age was starting to catch up with him and his chronic health problems had made living unbearable. By all accounts he also sank into a deep depression when George W. Bush was reelected three months earlier. As despairing as he felt at the end of the Campaign of 1972, Election Day 2004 was the final nail in the coffin. The good Doctor was quite a perceptive guy. It's a fairly good bet that he saw the future all-too-clearly and wanted to cash in his chips - get out while the getting was good as it were. I won't stand in judgement of Hunter Thompson. I can't.

3550195,5,B001EDFSIQ,"Worth watching for a different perspective on the 60's and a counter-culture writer's life.  The film mixes documentary clips with the Johnny Depp 'Fear and Loathing' film, which kind of works in a way.  I enjoyed seeing Ralph Steadman's story of encountering Thompson, and actually seeing Steadman in the process of creating his art.  Artists will like this part I think, Steadman is given quite a bit of screen time and the art is shown quite well, not just in brief flashes.  Jann Wenner was interesting too, to see the perspective of Thompson's editor, what it was like to be on the receiving end of a writer's journey.  Some great TV clips from the Hell's Angels book era are shown too, like from the 'Whats My Line' show, and seeing an actual Hell's Angel riding his Harley into the TV studio on camera is priceless.  The scene of the Chicago convention riots really reminds me of the Occupy police riots, and how if anything, the police and America as a whole are even more fascist now than in the 60's.  Anyway, in the end it is kind of a sad testimonial to the dead-end of drugs and alcohol.  For all of Thompson's evangelism of peyote, it didn't seem to do him much good spiritually or mentally, or even as a writer, though the vision of Las Vegas as populated by lizard people is not too far off.",1342310400,2,1307,4.485232067510548

This is a informational and a good movie for a backround about Hunter, but please, please, please read his works to find out about HST in his own words, theres nothing quite like it, you will see here as it is always said the movie is never as good as a book.",1291075200,,880,4.005681818181818
3550199,4,B001EDFSIQ,"One of the best documentaries out there on Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. It really gives you a good idea of fear and loathing on the campaign trail 72' and on his political insights throughout his life. You realize that he was, as crazy as he seems; but that it was as some sort of twisted genius, a literary scribe reporting the grim realities that were the ""American Dream"".

HST was a real outlaw in a time of great change for America. His works will always be remembered and this documentary is a good overview of his great and early works. While it gets a little vague after Campaign Trail 72' it touches on his later works but the latter half is more so about Hunter himself. That eventually what he found was that America was slowly killing itself. The film ends on a real quick note after that, but the substance of his early work and the footage from 72' is real gold. You learn a lot about Hunter in those early years. Full of the rage and on that pure gonzo journalist edge.

If you enjoyed this movie, or HST at all I recommend ""Breakfast with hunter"" and other related works. A good portion of the HST footage is from these films and if you own this, you should pick up Breakfast as well. It's a film for the HST elite or anyone looking to know more about Hunter S. Thompson.

3550206,3,B001EDFSIQ,"Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson: 6 out of 10: Is Hunter S Thompson any more relevant to modern journalism than Joe Namath is to modern football? After all, both were men of their times. In addition, both faded badly by the mid-seventies. Thompson's early work is excellent (a copy of ""The Proud Highway"" sits on my bookshelf) and reached its pinnacle with Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.

A mere three years later Rolling Stone publisher Jenn Warner had become so fed up with Thompson he basically tried to have him killed.

As [...] puts it ""Then, early one evening in March 1975, Hunter was watching a nightmarish film of the evacuation of Da Nang on the evening news. The phone rang, and Hunter picked it up. It was Wenner, saying, ""How would you like to go to Vietnam?"" Hunter could not resist. The collapse of the American empire was a happening tailor-made for his talents. Within days, he was heading out over the Pacific. He arrived in Saigon hours after Thieu's palace had been bombed and staffed by his own Air Force. For a man who lived with the conviction that the world was going to end next Monday, this was an especially ominous portent. Thompson had the sense of ""walking into a death camp."" This was it. He would never get out alive. As it turned out, the fate that was in store for him was even worse. Thompson discovered that, even as he was on his way to Vietnam, Wenner had taken him off retainer - in effect, fired him - and with the retainer went his staff benefits, including health and life insurance."" Also leaving him no way out of Vietnam... a one-way ticket if you will.

Dude that is cold...

And that is the very nature of the problem with this documentary. Why is not this story mentioned? Who knows? It certainly was a turning point in Thompsons life (He apparently became more withdrawn and paranoid afterwards... understandably so)

Gonzo is a pollyanna look at Thompson. The abuse of his first marriage gets a glancing look and all the interviewees (Including Jimmy Carter, Pat Buchanan and Jenn Werner) seem hesitant to speak ill of the dead.

The fact that in a few short years Thompson turned from a well-respected writer into a Muppet and Doonesbury cartoon is not covered well. The fact is mentioned but the reasons are glossed over. It is as if the film is worried that by mentioning his failures it will reduce his significance.

Yet, I would argue that Thompson's effect on Journalism is larger than he gets credit for. Reporters nowadays often ignore facts, concentrating instead on how events make them feel. Anderson Cooper crying during the Hurricane Katrina coverage threatened to become a bigger story than the storm itself. (He was not helped when fellow Mensa candidate Wolf Blitzer said ""You simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals'many of these people, almost all of them that we see are so poor and they are so black"")

The documentary never really focuses on this aspect either. Gonzo seems to fear pulling back any of the masks its subject wears presumably scared of what it might find. Gonzo would have been better served concentrating on one period of time and focusing its energies.

That said, for those unfamiliar with Hunter S Thompson outside of his Muppet form this is a good start. Moreover, if it gets people to read his early work so much the better.",1258416000,3,3370,4.650420168067227
3550207,3,B001EDFSIQ,"After watching the documentary ""Gonzo"" about Hunter Thompson I decided that Hunter Thompson and Truman Capote are very similar: both are talented but uneducated writers who became cultural icons, and in so doing died as writers. As Glenn Beck chronicles brilliantly in his biography ""Capote,"" Truman Capote reached the pinnacle of his career with the publication of ""In Cold Blood,"" and even though he was still in his thirties he would spend the rest of his life engaged in drunken debauchery and tragically comic romances.

I don't know enough about Hunter Thompson to know when he reached the pinnacle of his career but according to the documentary ""Gonzo"" he reached it after his political reporting during the 1972 Presidential election. Suddenly more famous than the people he was covering he could no longer write. His life ended when the George Bush presidency (and the specter of Nixon returning to haunt America yet again) drove Hunter Thompson to kill himself. Thus, Hunter Thompson was America's social conscience.

Alex Gibney is obviously a skilled documentary director. He had to assemble all of Hunter Thompson's writings, the impressive array of media coverage and Hollywood productions about or inspired by him, two decades of American cultural history, and interviews with all the famous people who knew him into a two-hour documentary -- and so ""Gonzo"" was a work of passion. And the editing is truly superb, weaving together a lot of disjointed material into occasional sparks of insight. However impressive the production quality the documentary is still overwrought and bloated -- two hours is a really long time to sit around watching Hunter Thompson being Hunter Thompson, and after the first hour I really wanted to leave.

That's the problem with many directors today -- they can't allow themselves to make something entertaining -- it has to have social value. And so ""Gonzo"" spends a great deal of time on how Hunter Thompson really despised Nixon for all the right reasons, and makes the inevitable comparison of Nixon to Bush. It's an affecting artifice but it's still an artifice because you can't help but feel that rather than America's social conscience Hunter Thompson was nothing more than an infantile narcissist.

Glenn Beck's biography of Truman Capote is deeply sympathetic, as you would expect from a writer who knew his subject personally and who spent thirteen years on the book. But it doesn't shy away from the fact that Truman Capote personally engineered his own destruction, and Mr. Beck does not at all blame anyone or anything else.

The unfortunate fact about Hunter Thompson was that he, like Truman Capote, was an infantile narcissist. No one asked him to take drugs. No one asked him to flaunt himself in front of the national media. No one asked him to abandon his family. He did this all to himself, and while he was a talented writer there was no truth and substance to what he wrote -- like Capote, he just sounded right but in the end he just sounded good. I remember watching the movie ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""but I can't remember what it was about -- that I think is Hunter Thompson -- he was such a outlandish character you have to remember him but what he actually said and wrote you just can't remember. ""Gonzo"" tries too hard to make Hunter Thompson the hero, and make a cultural icon of the seventies relevant to the post-9/11 world.

A much better documentary than ""Gonzo"" is ""An Unreasonable Man,"" which is about Ralph Nader. ""An Unreasonable Man"" confronts all the criticisms directed at Ralph Nader, specifically how he helped George Bush by running as the Green Party candidate in 2000 -- it's an honest and serious documentary because it's about an honest and serious man who raises honest and serious questions about our political system. ""Gonzo"" lets us be voyeurs, and glimpse into the wild juvenile life that Hunter Thompson lead, and then asks us to take him seriously because he killed himself and railed against George W. Bush.

In this way the documentary is asking you to take it seriously -- and if you do you can also feel you've spent two hours productively. I'm sorry but I can't yet bring myself to that delusion.",1257811200,5,4208,4.893408134642356

Whether you are a fan of his writing, or just curious about the man, this will give you a good overview of the writing and deeds that he has become most famous for.

I was already familiar with most of the facts, but enjoyed this anyway for all of the footage of him. It was a treat to get to see him in his prime, and I especially enjoyed seeing all of the stuff from when he ran for Sheriff in Aspen.

He was such an interesting guy, I would recommend this to you even if you aren't a fan, and don't have an interest in journalism.",1234569600,,630,4.105691056910569
3550224,5,B001EDFSIQ,"Some of the ideas presented here have previously been used in reviewing Hunter Thompson's books.

Generally the most the trenchant social criticism, commentary and analysis complete with a prescriptive social program ripe for implementation has been done by thinkers and writers who work outside the realm of bourgeois society, notably socialists and other progressive thinkers. Bourgeois society rarely allows itself, in self defense, to be skewered by trenchant criticism from within. This is particularly true when it comes from a known dope fiend, gun freak and all-around lifestyle addict like the late, lamented Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. Nevertheless, although he was far from any thought of a socialist solution and would reject such a designation we could travel part of the way with him. We saw him as a kindred spirit. He was not one of us- but he was one of us. All honor to him for pushing the envelope of journalism in new directions and for his pinpricks at the hypocrisy of bourgeois society. Such men are dangerous.

That said, the DVD under review, complete with the ""talking head"" commentaries by those who knew him like his hard pressed wife and ex-wife, Professor Douglas Brinkley and Jann Wanner (of ""Rolling Stone"" magazine) and pertinent readings from his works by the likes of Johnny Depp is both a valentine to his memory and a rather full exposition of his most creative years from the late 1960's to the mid-1970's. From his success with the still worthy sociological study ""The Hell's Angels"" about the West Coast outlaw bikers, which took him to the dark side of the counter culture of the 1960's, to ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" with his companion the ""Brown Buffalo"" , Oscar Acosta, which took him to the dark side of the American dream, to ""Fear and Loathing on Campaign Trail 1972"" , which took him to the dark side of American politics he fearlessly (some would say recklessly) skewered one and all in the fight for new cultural values.

I am not sure whether at the end of the day Hunter Thompson saw himself or wanted to been seen as a voice, or the voice, of his generation but he would not be an unworthy candidate. In any case, his was not the voice of the ""Generation of '68"" being just enough older to have been formed by an earlier, less forgiving milieu. His earlier writings show that effect. His work from South America, for example, is almost straight journalism. His later best stuff was on a different order of magnitude. Only a few, and with time it seems fewer in each generation, allow themselves to search for some kind of truth even if they cannot go the whole distance. As with all journalists, and in the end that was his forte, as indeed with all writers especially those who are writing under the pressure of time lines and for mass circulation media these pieces show an uneven quality. However the total effect is to blast old bourgeois society almost to its foundations. Others will have to push on further.

One should note that `gonzo' journalism is quite compatible with socialist materialism. That is, the writer is not precluded from interpreting the events described within himself/herself as an actor in the story. The worst swindle in journalism, fostered by the formal journalism schools, as well as in other disciplines like history and political science is that somehow one must be `objective'. Reality is better served if the writer puts his/her analysis correctly and then gets out of the way. In his best, and those are mainly his early works highlighted here, that was Hunter's way.

As a member of the ""Generation of 1968"" I would note that this was a period of particular importance which won Hunter his spurs as a journalist. Hunter, like many of us, cut his political teeth on one Richard Milhous Nixon, at one time President of the United States and all- around political chameleon. Thompson went way out of his way, and with pleasure, skewering that man when he was riding high. He was moreover just as happy to kick him when he was down, just for good measure. Nixon represented the `dark side' of the American spirit- the side that appears today as the bully boy of the world and as craven brute. If for nothing else Brother Thompson deserves a place in the pantheon of journalistic heroes for this exercise in elementary political hygiene. Anyone who wants to rehabilitate THAT man before history please consult Thompson's work. Hunter, I hope you find the Brown Buffalo wherever you are. Damn, the 2008 campaign, despite the hoopla, was boring without your knife even if it was not as sharp as in the old days. Watch this DVD. And then read his books.

3550230,3,B001EDFSIQ,"I became a fan of Hunter S. Thompson the day I opened up the latest issue of Rolling Stone and began reading the first installment of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", and continued to be a fan for the rest of his life, in spite of the decline in his writing (which began, as far as I was concerned, as early as ""The Curse of Lono""), so I approached this film with great interest and excitement.  And much like Thompson's work, I found parts of it to be highly entertaining while other parts were almost unbearable.  For me, the best stuff was the achival film footage of Thompson at work and play, being interviewed, campaigning for sheriff, etc.  The worst stuff was Johnny Depp reading Thompson's writing: the written word doesn't always work so well when read aloud, and Depp's almost somnambulant recitation shines a glaring light on just how stylized and contrived Thompson's words could be.  What worked PERFECTLY on the page falls flat on its face when uttered aloud (a big problem for me with the film version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" as well).  Another shortcoming of the film was the director's tendency to devote too much time to the events Thompson was writing about: there are parts of the film that made me feel like I was watching a documentary on the History Channel about something other than HST.  It also seems that 85% of the movie was devoted to about ten years of Thompson's life ('65-'75), and although this was undoubtedly the most important part of his life as a writer and activist, it still seems ridiculously lopsided (the director addresses this issue in his commentary).  The best moments here are absolutely 5-star material, but there's a fair bit of stuff that I could have done without.

A film critic wondered about the hangovers (Ebert). Actually I was curious about the substance abuse myself because one of the most interesting things about Hunter Thompson was that he lived a lifestyle that kills people usually decades before the age he sort of made it to. The exploration of the conflict with the media persona Dr. Gonzo and the man Hunter Thompson was good. I didn't know about his helping Jimmy Carter get started toward the White House. Now I'm totally in the minority on this--but it would have been better to use a little bit less classic rock. I know! I know OK??! Yea, yea the music is great and it brings back that time, etc., etc. I think every documentary I've seen on 60s figures or that era has these 60s rock songs and I could do with them less--not played throughout the whole thing. You don't need a doc on a writer in the 20s with swing playing loudly the whole time. So, anyway this was MY impression. And Depp is cool sitting in a bar properly dressed for his scenes reading famous passages with a pistol in one hand and classic Thompson book in the other, but.. Well I don't know how cool that is. And well, again, what *I* was hoping for was a real outsider perspective that took a cold, hard, sober critical view--not another celebration of a 60s icon. And that's OK but not as interesting to me. Some of the commentators have an interesting thing or two to say. They collected many famous friends in politics and the entertainment industry. I would have appreciated some brilliant rightwinger nut come on and slam Thompson and the counterculture. (Pat Buchanan spoke only as a friend which was very entertaining btw, BUT, he's no nutcase. I'm talking a real Allan Bloom type, although he's dead.) Maybe have a conservative literary critic dismiss his work or a historian to place in better context the social phenomenon of Thompson/Dr. Gonzo. Have a doctor explain in detail that it is a miracle Thompson didn't die form liver failure years ago. Or, here's a good one--have a leftist or two take issue with the politics. Mix it up more I say. It's not like most Americans even to this day approve of what Thompson stood for--let's explore more *why* and why perhaps we shouldn't be so quick to celebrate the counterculture.

The panorama of the sixties was quite interesting and very well done as was the profile of Owl Creek and Colorado. The bottom line though is that Thompson's was a wasted life.

The film succeeds--despite itself--primarily on the strength of the raw material (i.e. Thompson himself and his story) and Johnny Depp's narration, the arrangement of which was a masterstroke on the part of the producers.

The film is, however, rife with issues that annoyed me and kept from from fully enjoying it.

A. It is about 15-20 minutes too long. Far too many times I found myself looking at the counter to see how far it had gone.
B. It gets too cute by half in many instances with animation, reenactments, music, and graphics. Call me old fashioned, but I don't like the ""MTV Style"" or ""ADHD Style"" of filmmaking here. To me, if the story is compelling and the editing is done well, there is no need for these effects. See Errol Morris' work for an example of what I mean by this.
C. It tries to be ""avant-garde"" by never telling us who is being interviewed. Again, call me old fashioned, but I want to know who is speaking when they appear on camera.
D. After all is said is done, it does not present much in the way of new info for even casual Thompson fans such as myself already generally familiar with his life and work.

I would not have watched this if not for the excellent reviews from Ebert and other prominent and trustworthy critics, and in this case I guess they saw something I didn't. Hey, it happens sometimes. Anyway, this is about a 7/10 for me again on the strength of the material itself and the brilliant choice of Depp for narrator which was awesome, and I say that as someone who really isn't a fan of Depp at all. He was perfect for this role, however.",1230508800,2,1707,4.375394321766562
3550251,4,B001EDFSIQ,"The late great Hunter S. Thompson was a mass of walking contradictions, someone who will likely always remain a bit of a cipher. He was a writer whose work was imbued with DFH political idealism and tempered by a full personal commitment to the hedonistic enjoyment of sex, drugs and rock `n' roll; yet he loved to collect guns, watch stuff blow up and counted the likes of Pat Buchanan among his personal friends.  I don't envy a biographer in any medium such a daunting task.

In Gonzo: the Life and Work of Hunter S. Thompson, director Alex Gibney(Taxi to the Dark Side, Enron: the Smartest Guys in the Room) may have discovered the right formula. He takes an approach as scattershot and unpredictable as the subject himself and runs with it, utilizing a frenetic pastiche of talking heads, vintage home movies, feature film clips, animation, rare audio tapes and snippets of prose (voiced by Johnny Depp, who has become Thompson's theatrical avatar, like Hal Holbrook's synonymous identity with Mark Twain). While Gibney keeps the timeline fairly linear, he does make interesting choices along the way-and equally interesting omissions (e.g., Thompson's formative years are given the bum's rush).

Gibney ostensibly begins his film with an examination of the 1966 book Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga, which first established Thompson's groundbreaking style of method journalism.  An overview of his Rolling Stone reportage ensues, highlighted by the assignment that resulted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

A lion's share of the film is devoted to two chapters of Thompson's life: his quasi-serious run for sheriff (!) of Aspen Colorado and his coverage of the 1972 presidential elections (recounted in Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72). In fact, the segment regarding the 1972 campaign is nearly a stand-alone ""film within the film""; it's such a riveting and well-crafted piece that I wished Gibney had expounded even further and turned it into a full-length companion documentary. Gibney also reminds us of something largely forgotten,yet significant-the fact that Thompson was instrumental in bringing then-governor Jimmy Carter into the national political spotlight back in 1974, by championing his amazing Law Day Speech.

Consequently, I think political junkies are going to dig this film a lot more than the fans who remain solely enamored with Hunter S. Thompson's more superficial, substance-fueled ""rebel"" persona. Excepting the depiction of Thompson's relatively unproductive latter years, which were spent ensconced in his Colorado compound, too distracted by guns, drugs and sycophants to do little else but slowly disappear up his own legend (like Elvis at Graceland) the director admirably suppresses the urge to play up the public notoriety and revel in the writer's recreational excesses.

The film is not without its flaws; the frequent use of Depp clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas becomes distracting and begins to feel like cheating (by contrast, there is only one brief nod to Bill Murray's turn in Where the Buffalo Roam.) This is a minor quibble, because there are some real treasures here as well.  Devotees will delight in listening to the audio snippets from the original cassettes that Thompson made while cruising through the Nevada desert with his attorney (the DVD features additional excerpts as an extra).

This is certainly no sugar-coated puff piece; there are several ex-wives and associates aboard who make no bones about reminding us that the man could be a real tool. On the other hand, examples of his genuine humanity and idealism are brought to the fore as well, making for an insightful and fairly balanced overview of his dichotomous nature. What the director does not forget is that, at the end of the day, HST was the most unique American political commentator/ social observer who ever sat down to peck at a bullet-riddled typewriter. We could sure use him now.",1229904000,2,3948,5.15625
3550252,3,B001EDFSIQ,"I've been intrigued by HST ever since I was a kid growing up in Evergreen, Colorado in the late 1960's and early 1970's.  Word of the ""Freak Ticket"" and its mighty and outrageous leader made its way over the mountains from Aspen and astonished all of us. His audacity echoed in those mountains (and still does to this day).  I also recall perusing those famous issues of Rolling Stone at the Walgreen's magazine counter where HST told-tale of all his intrepid investigations, and where sinister evil seemed to lurk around every dark corner. And my appreciation for his unique approach to things has grown as I've matured.  I see him as a patriot, and as a courageous one at that.  It takes courage to tell the truth about things--or something close to the truth, but conveyed in a very interesting way--especially when there are lots of powerful forces out there praying for your demise, and maybe even plotting it.

I haven't read everything HST wrote, but I've read most of it, and I've read a biography or two as well.  I was delighted when I heard about this documentary, and I rented it off of Netflix the moment it was listed.  And, yes, I'll probably end up buying it for my library of 1960's retrospectives.  I'm absolutely fascinated by everything that happened in the US--and the world as well--between 1965 and 1975.  It was an amazingly vital and dynamic period of our history, and will probably never again be matched during my life or the life of my children. HST was a major player in several of those realms from that period.

But, on the whole, this documentary seemed a little flat to me. I was vaguely confused from time to time. It seemed lacking in continuity.  For example, they discuss the Ali/Frazer fight in Africa in the early 1970's--which HST buoycotted because he thought Ali was going to be destroyed; so, instead of going to the fight, HST took a swim--and then the next phase shows HST in the late 1990's or early 2000's--swollen, belligerent, dysfunctional, bizarre.  They omitted almost everything relating to the three decade time-frame in between. Those decades were his decades of decline; I would have liked to know the particulars of why and how.

I was frequently distracted by trying to figure out where and when a given episode occured. The presentation was definitely not a chronological presentation, and so the viewer has to establish their own time line of events. It was repeatedly difficult to place the descriptions of disparate developments into any type of exacting, fluid context.  The film needed a voice-over narrator to provide segue continuity and to make for a comprehensive, smooth examination of the man and his event-rich life.  Instead, we get this varied, slightly jagged, series of interviews where sometimes extremely significant events are mentioned, almost in passing.  I found myself developing more questions as the film went along rather than getting answers. I looked HST up on Wikipedia this morning, and there were dozens of interesting features to this man's career which were not even alluded to in this documentary--major gaps relating to essential aspects of his life story. (Example: his falling out with Jann Wenner and aborted assignments to Vietnam and elsewhere.)

True, I'm grateful to have seen the great footage, much of which I had never seen before.  And the interviews with Jann Wenner,Jimmy Carter, Pat Buchanan, HST's wives, and McGovern and some of the others did provide some salient insights.  But my curiosity continued to grow rather than to be sated. I would have liked to hear recollections from Johnny Depp, and Bill Murray, two friends who I'm sure could have offered a lot, and I would have liked to have heard more from HST's son, who seems like an articulate and amazingly normal man.

HST was a blemished figure, and probably he is more myth than reality when all is said and done.  I recall seeing him on a late night talk show (Leno, I think) in the early 2000's.  HST was thoroughly drunk and slurred every word.  He was a bloated mess, and, essentially, he was already dead. But, for that magical decade or so, few people burned brighter and more intensely than Hunter S. Thompson.  His unique combination of anger and humor is something which will be hard to match, and he is definitely one of the colorful characters from the century which we have just left behind.",1228348800,20,4373,4.831099195710456
3550253,4,B001EDFSIQ,"""Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson"" is an overview of the life and passions of Hunter S. Thompson, inventor of ""gonzo"" journalism and iconic hero of liberalism -at least for those liberals who didn't mind all the guns. Through interviews with an impressive variety of Thompson's friends and associates, narration by Johnny Depp, and archival footage of Thompson himself, director Alex Gibney takes us through Thompson's life, concentrating on his career and image. The story starts in earnest in 1965, when Thompson was ""imbedded"" with the Hell's Angels for over a year, his first exercise in participatory journalism and the subject of his first book, ""Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs"" (1966).

That's followed by Thompson's experience of the 1968 Democratic Convention, his  bid for Sheriff of Aspen on a pro-marijuana platform in 1970, the story behind ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", and his work for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine, including his coverage of the McGovern-Nixon presidential campaign, which became ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail `72"", and finally his suicide in 2005. The film doesn't attempt to be a comprehensive biography. Thompson's years in the Air Force are not even mentioned, for example. I was pleasantly surprised by the array of people who consented to be interviewed: his first wife Sondi Wright (Sandy Thompson at the time), Tom Wolfe, former President Jimmy Carter, George McGovern and Pat Buchanan, ""Rolling Stone"" co-founder Jan Wenner, Jimmy Buffett, Thompson's frequent collaborator the artist Ralph Steadman, among others.

Alex Gibney is conventional in his approach to his unconventional subject. He doesn't criticize Thompson as much as he might or glorify him as much as fans sometimes do. This attempt at objectivity makes ""Gonzo"" a good introduction to Hunter S. Thompson but also a bit bland. Ralph Steadman's art work is used liberally throughout the film, which is great. And there is some attempt to convey Thompson's eventual frustration with the public persona that he had fostered. Though ""Gonzo"" isn't a fawning look at the man, it is a fond look. Thompson's rejection of the sham of objectivity in journalism may be admirable, he was a man who liked to scrutinize other people's ethics much more than his own. ""Gonzo"" leaves the audience to draw its own conclusions about things like that. At times I wished that it were more incisive, but there is a lot of interesting material here.

The DVD (Magnolia 2008): Bonus features include 5 deleted scenes, 19 extended interviews, a gallery of 75 drawings by Ralph Steadman, 8 Photo Galleries, including old photos, pages from Thompson's notebooks, and other memorabilia, a list of 18 of Hunter's Guns, a tribute performance of ""Wayward and Weary"" by Tift Merritt (4 min), 2 audio excerpts from ""The Gonzo Tapes"" of Thompson and Oscar Acosta in Las Vegas 1971, and a feature commentary by director Alex Gibney. Gibney takes us through the when, where, and what we see in the film, providing some additional understanding of the footage, and he offers comments on Thompson. Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish.",1228003200,20,3187,5.134874759152216

8297877,5,B001EDFSIQ,"HST,  ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.""  Wonderful flashbacks to late 60s and 70s, Aspen, Woody Creek, the surreal cartoons Ralph Steadman,in the Rolling Stone with its original newsprint tabloid format.  Great documentary on life and times  of the great gonzo journalist.  Brings back great memories for the 72 election, Nixon andWatergate.

Complements a re-read of Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 and serves a prep and comfort to current times.

I purchased the video after learning I couldn't find the streaming source.

Go ahead, ""Buy the ticket, take the ride.""",1490227200,,594,5.114583333333333
