Parts are just laugh out lound funny such as the swimming sequences, but it goes on way too long about the  teaching methods that are used to teach the kids to swim.  My main problem  is the obligatory third act, where the girl realizes that Kintaro is a  genius and a stud and she's sorry he's gone.  In this installment, the  third act goes on way too long, and I just got bored.  Still, pretty funny.  I like episode 5 the best, though...",950572800,,554,4.240384615384615
