8084080,4,B000BB18O0,"I bought mine used, I think they replaced Movie 3 with the standard release. The subs are different and have more mistakes than the other two films. It is only ""complete"" in the sense it includes the only three films released in the USA. The whole franchise is a 19 volume manga series, two TV series, and six total films. Not gonna talk about the movies themselves, that would take too much time and room. But they are a fun bit of overlooked J-horror, since most of them were made *before* The Ring.",1440028800,,501,4.397849462365591

8084082,4,B000BB18O0,"I already had the complete ""Eko Eko Azarak"" series on VHS tape. But when all three movies finally made it onto dvd, I decided to purchase them. The first two installments in the series star Kimika Yoshino as the wizard. She's very pretty and the movies themsleves are pretty good for the budget they were produced on. The third installment stars Hinako Saeki. She's also very pretty and in my opinion, she's a better actress than Yoshino. Unfortunately, ""Eko Eko Azarak 3"" is just plain terrible and that's mainly due to the fact that it has zero budget. Not the actress' fault. These three movies came out just before ""Ringu"" and I'm surprised Hollywood hasn't tried to remake them yet.",1365984000,2,687,4.733333333333333
8084083,5,B000BB18O0,"Wow I can't get enough of this movie.  It checks all my favorite categories, horror, lesbianism, school-girls, supernatural!

A Great movie with several weaker sequels.",1291852800,,168,5.68
8084084,4,B000BB18O0,This was an enjoyable trilogy to watch. But don't pat too too much for it.,1228521600,,74,4.0
8084085,4,B000BB18O0,"Misa Kuroi is a girl with problems. First off, she is the new girl, recently transfered and finding herself plagued by rumors. Secondly, the rumors are true. She is secretly a powerful witch, the most recent in a long line of witch-girls to inherit the power. (""Eko Eko Azarak"" is her chant to summon her mystic powers.) Thirdly, someone else in her school is summoning Lucifer and sacrificing her classmates so that she may be crowned empress of the universe. Not a good start for the poor girl.

If it all sounds a bit like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" well, it is, although the comic series that ""Eko Eko Azarak"" is based on predates ""Buffy"" by about 20 years. No matter who influenced who, the basic premise is familiar, and comparisons can be made. But ""Eko Eko Azarak"" is no hip, slick-talking teenage drama. The violence is gory and the sex is explicit, and the students of this high school do more screaming and dying than worrying about fashion.  The magic takes its influences from anywhere it can get it, with Lovecraftian monsters and the Christian Satan getting equal time.

This 3-disk set is an amazing bargain, containing all three movies ""Wizard of Darkness,"" ""Birth of the Wizard,"" and ""Misa the Dark Angel.""  None of the movies are mind-blowingly great, but they certainly hold up as good for the genre. The special effects are so-so, but the girls are beautiful especially lead actress Kimika Yoshino.  The films were very popular in Japan, spawning a TV series as well.

Overall, this is a fun series and solid horror/magic films.  You pretty much know what you are getting in for, and if you like the genre you can't go wrong.  After all, you can't go wrong with a film whose tagline is ""Come, darkness and vicious spirits. Lucifer, let this cute girl be the empress of the universe""",1152835200,24,1804,4.686708860759493
