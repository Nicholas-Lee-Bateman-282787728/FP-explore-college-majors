6124272,4,B00GZ0DP9W,Great explanation of the Catholic belief on purgatory and a healthy reminder why we need to stop canonizing everyone who passes and start praying for them.,1410480000,16,155,5.0
6124273,5,B00GZ0DP9W,"This is an amazing documentary film on the Catholic Doctrine of Purgatory. After watching this, it actually makes sense that Purgatory is a universal Christian belief, not just for Catholics. My hope is that Protestants and non-Catholics alike will be able to relate to this discussion on Purgatory and be opened up to the truth.

As a recommendation to all....please watch and learn from this documentary. The souls of the faithful departed in Purgatory need our prayers at every moment. Please do not abandon them.",1393286400,27,516,5.070588235294117
6124274,5,B00GZ0DP9W,"This DVD was a gift and I acknowledge that I was apprehensive about watching it.  We don't hear much about Purgatory at Church except during the month of November when we're encouraged to pray for the souls there, and I think a lot of us have concerns and some misconceptions about life after death.  This excellent documentary was very informative, clear, and complete in its coverage, and watching it left me feeling positive and encouraged.  As a result of watching this I plan to do more reading about, and certainly more praying for, what has aptly been labeled 'The Forgotten Church'.  This documentary will appeal to both scientific and mystical thinkers, and is highly recommended.",1389916800,20,689,4.965217391304348
6124275,5,B00GZ0DP9W,I am in awe over this well explained and positive Purgatory movie.  It focuses on the mercy of Our Lord and how we can absolutely have hope in the future.  It is never too late to improve our faith journey!  We do not have to look at death with dread but with hope and expectation.

6124283,4,B00GZ0DP9W,The material is divided into two main sections.  The first and more interesting was results reported on a large study of near death experiences (NDE).  The author of that work organized his material in a logical form focusing on several common experiences 1000 or more people experienced.  The author concluded that his study proved life exists after death; so that Purgatory and Heaven can't be excluded.,1433289600,11,405,5.106060606060606
