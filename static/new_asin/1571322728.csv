188189,5,1571322728,"This is one of the better tales as the story is easily grasped by kids who face similar problems every day. Junior Asparagus is faced with the problem of choosing to invite the new kid at school who is different. That night, as he wrestles with the decision, Bob and Larry come to ask Junior's help in saving their ship from certain destruction. Junior saves the day by recognizing that differences in others are beneficial and enlists the help of Jimmy and Jerry whom no one had previously thought of as important. Very funny, well done, and an excellent message! My one year old daughter loves ALL her Veggie Tales and this one is among her favorite!",984355200,,652,4.581196581196581
188190,5,1571322728,"When I first heard of Veggie Tales I thought the idea of vegetables as video characters was uninteresting and hokey...then I sat down to watch ,""Are You My Neighbor?"",with my grandchildren and found that the  characters delighted me as well as my grandchildren, ages 6 months to 7  years. As we watched, we all laughed. When the story would end, the  children would ask to see it again and again. The humor is intelligent and  the stories joyfully convey valuable lessons to young and older alike.  Veggie Tales are neither bland nor boring and they don't preach.  The humor  and engaging characters make the lessons memorable and fun so the videos  are highly effective.  I don't tire of the reruns and that's a rare thing  to experience in children's videos.  I recommend ""Are You My  Neighbor?"" for the children in your life. This is one to enjoy  together!  Also, check out some of the other fun titles in the Veggie Tales  series like, ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"", and the videos with  'Larry-boy'.",964396800,12,1003,4.710982658959537
188191,5,1571322728,"I'm 19, and like the person listed before me, I first saw the veggies in my 12-th grade Religion class.  But I enjoyed the video and now own the entire series.  This was a very good episode of the VT.  The first half is a ""Dr. Seuss"" parody/retelling of the Good Samaritan Parable.  It  comes off very well with some great songs along the way.  The Star-Trek  parody, the second half of the video, is also very good and, would you  believe it, the first time I heard the ""I can be your friend  song"" I nearly cried, twas so beautiful.  Great music.  Great fun.  Make sure you watch your vegetables!",956361600,5,598,4.288288288288288
188192,5,1571322728,"Are You My Neighbor is absolutely the best Veggietales episodeout there.  The two different stories along with Silly Songs withLarry are great!  Phil Vischer and everyone at Big Idea Productions put a lot of creativity and polish in this tape.  From wonderful songs, to rhyming stories with a plot, wonderful 3-D images and great jokes along the way, you're sure to be engrossed in watching it over and over (as well as your kids! ).
And best of all, it has a point. ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" I've seen all Veggiestales videos, including the just released 'King George and the Ducky' tape, but 'Are You My Neighbor' is the best.",954720000,10,636,4.711711711711712
188193,4,1571322728,"I am 18 years old, and I first saw this movie in my 12th grade religion class, believe it or not.  The video is obviously aimed at young children, but it can be entertaining for a person of any age.  This basic story line  follows that of the ""Good Samaritan"" in the Bible, with some  minor differences.  In the beginning, we learn that the  ""shoe-heads"" and ""pot-heads"" (seriously) are in a major  dispute with each other for some reason.  Eventually, a kid from one of  these groups is out walking when he is suddenly attacked by robbers, who  beat him up pretty well.  This is all ""cartoon violence"", which  probably would not scare young children.  But anyway, as the story goes,  people walk by the kid who was beat up, but they do not stop to help  because they are so ""busy, so very busy"", which eventually  becomes a song.  Following this, a kid from the ""other"" group  stops to help the wounded kid, and gets him help, and we learn that it is  best to ""Love Thy Neighbor.""  That's it.  That's the story.  Believe me, that summary does not reveal a thing because it has the same  basic plot of that in the Bible.
  Now, for my own review.  I thought  it was all right for a re-telling of this parable, but not the best.  Probably the only reason that I was able to actually keep an interest in  the film is because, while viewing it with the rest of my teenage class, we  were able to pick out a number of sexual references.  Doing that made the  movie downright hilarious.  These references do not actually exist, but it  you look really hard at anything in the world, you can find that kind of  stuff.  But, like I said, that was the only thing that held my interest in  the film. The animation is good and the songs can be very catchy.  I think  that this would be great for any kid who is in Sunday school through first  or second grade, as well as for their parents.  It probably would not be  interesting for anyone else unless you have a good sense of humor.  Although I thought it was funny and overall pretty good, I better not be  getting this for my birthday!",952819200,,2078,4.285714285714286

188195,5,1571322728,"This hilarious video is packed with fun and inspiration.  From ""I can be your friend"" to ""Love your neighbor"", the veggies show us that hatred, or even indifference, have no place in God's plan.  The  Seuss-like poetry in Flibber-o-Loo will stick in your head and make you  smile.  Great for kids and adults.",947376000,9,308,4.735849056603773
188196,3,1571322728,"Our 22-month old loves all things Veggie, but this one gets on my nerves.  It tells the story of the Good Samaritan in a trivial way.  Seems to be saying, ""Love those who are different,"" without saying why.  I  know the creators are capable of doing better --- they did much much better  with ""Josh & the Big Wall,"" my favorite Veggie of all.

7797315,5,1571322728,"When released, this Veggie Tales video was a fresh wind of creativity all parents and their kids will love.  (I first saw this video as a single college student and loved it from the first.)  Since other reviewers give you an idea about the story line, I will focus on the artistic aspects of this video, which contains two of the best episodes produced by Big Idea.

Dr. Seuss meets Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan in the Story of Flibber-o-loo.  Yes, it's weird, wonderfully weird.  The pacing is perfect with humor at every turn.  In the tradition of old Warner Brothers cartoons, countless slapstick moments that children love are punctuated with sublime humor that only parents will get, like barbs tossed at the political and medical establishment.  The moral of the story is one every parent will approve -- the importance of overcoming prejudice to help those in need -- certainly something valuable in today's divisive society.

In a rare feat, the moral makes the story all the more hilarious rather than detracting from the fun.  The message is straight from Jesus, presented in a non-religious, non-sectarian way that challenges everyone but threatens no-one.  If only more artists and producers could find this sweet spot of non-offensive, even positive humor and hilarity....

The Gourds Must Be Crazy is a veggie Star Trek spoof (Captain Kirk and Scotty fans will enjoy the flashbacks) that extends the theme of dealing with others who are weird -- I mean different.  Yes, the singing gourds are a bit crazy.  But that's part of what makes this episode worth watching.

Speaking of crazy singing, the classic song ""Where is My Hairbrush"" (included as a bonus) is among the best musical works of all time.  Since its release, this song has been covered by multiple rock bands, for two artistic reasons:  it's a catchy tune that makes fine rock opera ... and it's chuckle-belly funny.  You won't hate yourself when you can't get the song out of your head.  I think you'll agree it's a song worth singing in the shower -- or even better, when you step out of the shower.",1121472000,2,2087,4.798319327731092
7797316,5,1571322728,"My son watches this over and over and never gets tired of it (age 3). The theme of loving one's neighbor is presented to kids seriously and practically in a humorous way. The stories are told on a kids (ages 2-6) level, but aren't patronizing or overly simplistic.

The first episode deals with prejudice between groups of people via the story of the Good Samaritan from the parables of Jesus. The two groups are represented by vegetables who wear shoes and pots on their heads respectively which stresses the inanity of prejudice a little more than the original story, but does a great job in showing how people's self-importance gets in the way of helping their fellow man.

The second episode will be very funny to adult fans of the original Star Trek and deals with the shunning of individuals due to differences. After Junior Aspargus confesses he doesn't want to invite a foreign boy to his birthday party, he is invited aboard the ""Starship Applepies"" where he learns that people's differences are gifts when a threatening giant meteor made of popcorn is eaten by two ""weird"" members of the crew, saving the day.",1117497600,,1119,4.762886597938144
7797317,5,1571322728,"This was the very first Veggie Tales I ever saw, way back in 1995, and I still think it is one of the best Veggie Tales ever made. Funny stories with moral messages, cool computer animation, silly songs you want to keep singing, and hilarious inside jokes for the older viewers. If you have other Veggie Tales videos but not this one, you have got to get this, it is wonderful! If you haven't yet jumped on the Veggie Tales bandwagon, I suggest you do so, and start with this video. Veggie Tales are videos that people of all ages love, from the little two year olds (A half hour video is perfect for that age) to the grown-ups. I have known a lot of people who have watched Veggie Tales (even non-Christians) and everyone loves them! My husband and I are as excited as our kids when a new Veggie Tales comes out. Try them, I know that you will love them.",1040083200,8,855,4.251533742331288

An OUTSTANDING beginning to an OUTSTANDING series of Christian videos aimed at children from 2 to 122.  The series continues from this charming beginning -- and continues to improve; continues to get funnier; and continues to teach values in a simple, non-threatening manner.
Believe me, as a clergyman (and as a parent) I've seen a lot of garbage in the Christian children's video market.  ""Veggie Tales"" is a welcome change.",1003104000,12,718,4.966666666666667

The second story taking place on the USS Applepies is halalrious. The Gourds Must Be Crazy and I am glad that they are! I own EVERY Veggie Tales video but this one still ranks as my #1. I suggest them all. Although I ahve not been over impressed with the Larry Boy videos, Madame Blueberry or Esther I know many people who rank these as their favorites.
