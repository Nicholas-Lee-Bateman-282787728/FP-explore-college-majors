7823902,5,6302280583,"It's a shame that this one is not available on DVD!  The Misses September 1989 Mirjam and Karin VanBreeschooten, only the second Playmate twins in the magazine's history, are given their own showcase here.  You see their hometown in Holland, watch as they film mini-profiles of each other, visit a castle, and so such more.  You even get to meet their parents.  One thing that makes this tape so fun is that the twins always seem to be having such a good time. The highlight of the tape (and this is a toughie, as it's all good) is when they dance in front of a white background to different types of music.  Playboy has never had twin Playmates of the Year, so the typo on the tape's label is interesting--it reads ""Playmate of the Year--Dutch Twins.""  Capping off the video is an entertaining profile of 50's Playmate and actress Jayne Mansfield, documenting her rise to stardom, and untimely death.",1397001600,2,901,4.635220125786163
7823903,2,6302280583,"Playboy Video Centerfold: Dutch Twins: Mirjam & Karin Van Breeschooten is 47 minutes long. The video is divided into two parts. Thirty-three minutes are dedicated to Mirjam & Karin Van Breeschooten-Playmates of the Month for September 1989. After a brief intro of full nudity, the bulk of the video is dedicated to their early years, how they became the first Playmates for the Dutch version of Playmates, how they became Playmates of the U.S. version Playboy and the twins interviewing each other. The twin tries to speak English but don't do a very good job. It is only in the last ten minutes does the full nudity kick in. So Mirjam & Karin are only nude 33% of the time. If the nudity was spread out during the thirty-three minutes, then this might have been a more enjoyable video. The second part is dedicated to Jayne Mansfield-Playboy's Playmate of the Month for February 1955. Basically it is a brief biography of the star.

7823904,5,6302280583,"This is Playboy at its best. The twins are shot in their hometown of Holland and there are some truly beautiful and breathtaking scenes. The girls' parents are interviewed and it's great to see their reaction to their twins in Playboy.

There is additional footage titled ""Playmate Update"" with Jayne Mansfield, which is done documentary-style with a narrator. There's black and white along with color footage that is informative, interesting, and sexy.",1133049600,,453,5.291666666666667

And, the shoot in the wonderful Nederland's location is the essence of this video's good point. I think Playboy had better make this video on DVD format.",970876800,2,309,4.43859649122807
