Absolutely no instruction, audio is unintelligible, and the dancers are not good enough for a workout video.  In addition, the company Caiman.com will not let me return the video because it's been opened.  BLAH!",1113264000,13,321,4.696428571428571
8011154,2,B0001EFVKO,"I was hoping for an excellent, in-depth bhangra workout. Bhangra is my favorite form of dance. After reading the reviews, I bought this DVD because I thought it would have advanced bhangra steps, however, this DVD has really basic bhangra steps.

I would not recommend this DVD for the following reasons:

1. The music they play is not good bhangra music

2. The actual bhangra dancing is only 12-13 minutes!

3. The moves are quite basic. I was hoping for some really high-energy moves

4.  Some of the dancers in the back are off beat and they look tired. They do not smile, they look like they are struggling.

I was hoping Veera and the others would have worn traditional Punjabi attire. I would not recommend this DVD for the beginner bhangra dancer because they do not go over the steps ahead of time to get you ready and I would not recommend this for someone who is already familiar with bhangra because you will already know the steps. Either way, the dancing segment is really short and the music is not good.",1110585600,16,1019,4.53551912568306
8011155,2,B0001EFVKO,"While I have many Indian friends and watched many performances, I still was way out of the loop on this video.  There is no instruction on how to do any of the steps.  The ""instructor"" just goes for it.  There are even shots of just her head so you have no idea what her body is doing and no way to know what you are supposed to be doing.  And it's quite a short workout session.",1097366400,16,379,3.9473684210526314
8011156,1,B0001EFVKO,"I tried this video because I love Bhangra.  The audio is off, the dancers aren't on beat, the moves are not very desi.  If you want a good Bhangra Instructional/Workout Video try ""Bhangra Workout-1"" with Sat Pavan Kaur.  Its really good.",1091836800,22,237,4.7317073170731705
