8606602,5,B00ELBZJZ0,"Saw the mini-series many years ago when it first came out.  A fascinating story line.  Of course, we know much more now about Mars than when the book/mini-series came out, not to mention the special effects.  Nevertheless, if you are willing to overlook the out-of-date aspects, it still makes a good and entertaining viewing.  Excellent and amazing for its time.",1513900800,,363,5.0
8606603,5,B00ELBZJZ0,"This was first a mini series on BBC, in three segments.  It is a reminder of what might be affected by people moving to Mars.  It exhibits visually the beauty of the original Martian Race and their wisdom, gained from everything our Earth people would also go through before they became as advanced.  It is beautifully told and visually very well done, even before all the motion picture technology really hit.  This is a classic!  Just be sure you are ordering the version you can play on US standard dvd players.  I ordered the wrong version and it was my fault but the seller refunded all, including shipping back to Germany.  They were very accommodating and honest!",1496966400,,670,4.6752136752136755
