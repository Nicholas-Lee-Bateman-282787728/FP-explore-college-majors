8049504,4,B0007ODIJ4,"I enjoyed this and it helped me out so that I could immediately apply the info to jazz band lead sheets.  I was looking for a quick turn around way to pick up enough info on the Freddy Green style to start using it - like that week - and this helped me do that.  Another really good reference I also bought from Amazon is:  Swing & Big Band Guitar: Four-to-the-bar Comping in the Style of Freddie Green.  That reference has a lot of info and a sample CD.  This item, has a DVD, more basic info, and will get you up and running fast!  Totally worth it if you are interested in jump starting this style.",1271894400,,601,4.094017094017094
