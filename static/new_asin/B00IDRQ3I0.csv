If you liked it great, but there's gotta be better options out there for crappy 80's movies.",1475280000,,267,4.3

8641318,3,B00IDRQ3I0,"Hellhole released by Scream Factory was originally released sometime in 1985 and after a VHS release it was long out of print and more or less forgotten in time. In 2014 Scream Factory planned a blu-ray release, but were unable apparently to track down the original negatives and the release was dropped. Sometime between 2014 through 2016, Scream Factory was able to come across different elements and mixed it together to create the complete film. Personally I love when films such as this are released. There's those movies you know, but haven't seen and when you view it for the first time that's great, but for me discovering an underground film has a certain excitement to it as it almost feels like I'm the only person in the world that knows this film. Hellhole was sort of marketed as a horror film and even the poster implies that. The opening scene is very slasher like and there's also a subplot with doctors doing deranged experiments, which adds a horror/sci-fi vibe to the film, but it's also sort of a crime/drama as well as a suspense/thriller and lastly a women in prison film (just replace the prison with a sanitarium).

Scream Factory has emerged as the leader in cult cinema and I fully understand why, but honestly I'd rate Arrow, Synapse, Severin and Grindhouse over Scream Factory, but SF knows what's best for business and they release films that are mostly well known and will most likely have strong sales to the very least good sales. That's actually a reason I prefer the other labels as they take more chances. Now don't take any of this wrong as I often anticipate the latest SF release. But when they release films such as Hellhole there's again an excitement for me discovering an unheard of film, but business wise it makes sense for SF to focus on films like Return of the Living Dead, Escape from New York and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 even if they already received blu-ray releases as all those will do far better sales than Hellhole.

As for the HD I feel as if SF delivers a good HD presentations, but not quite as good as the labels I mentioned in particular Arrow. However I have no issues with their HD video, but if we're simply going off that SF is middle of the pack as a whole, but Hellhole was quite the surprise as it features a surprisingly solid HD presentation. As I mentioned SF will do what's best for business, which is why they release films that are a little more notable. So when they do release an underground film we can't expect Hellhole to get the same treatment as say Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 in terms of extras and video, but again Hellhole features a far better HD presentation than I was expecting and while it may not be their best, but it does rate fairly high. The detail, clarity and sharpness are quite excellent as are colors. However seeing as two sources were mixed the other source material isn't quite on par as there's a noticeable drop off and noticeable print damage, but none of this hinders the film and the flaws with the 2nd source have to do with the elements used and nothing due to SF. But Hellhole outside of the 2nd source looks very good and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong HD presentation.

When it comes to overall package of the release Scream Factory always delivers the goods and some of my favorite releases are from SF, but once again not every film will get the same treatment and Hellhole simply isn't popular enough to warrant a release like the Collectors Edition releases from SF. The only features here are a trailer and an interview with Mary Woronov, which is highly entertaining and my only complaint is it only runs at 5-minutes.

As for the film itself I found it an ok film; Hellhole as mentioned does mix different genres and I felt it did hinder the film as there's no clear direction as most of the mixed genres feel underused. With that said it's still fairly entertaining, but I wouldn't rate it a personal favorite, but for fans of cult cinema you may find something worthy. My advice is watch the trailer and see if it interests you. Hellhole does feature a terrific cast of actors that most fans of cult cinema will recognize with some by name and others by face. Look for Robert Z'Dar best known as Matt Cordell in the Maniac Cop trilogy as a guard.",1469923200,15,4277,4.55064935064935
