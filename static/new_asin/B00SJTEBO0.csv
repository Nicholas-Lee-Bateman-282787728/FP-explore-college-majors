8698670,1,B00SJTEBO0,"I expected another good documentary on the true problem of overpopulation but instead got a LIE that there's no overpopulation problem.  Yes, developed nations have exploited at times, and that ain't right, but the ""solution"" isn't to add more people.  We are talking about the HEALTH OF THE PLANET HERE.  Werner Boote is a f idiot.",1496793600,,332,4.892857142857143
8698671,1,B00SJTEBO0,"This is a documentary with a mumbled message.  He ends up his journey concluding that global population rise isn't really a problem, that everyone can fit into the space available (even into the size of Austria);  the idea of population control is instead a rich nation conspiracy to lord it over the poorer nations.  This is dangerous nonsense - the global population has grown from 3 billion in 1960 to over 7 billion today and counting - it would have been even greater without the UN-sponsored program to provide family planning aka contraception to fast growing nations around the world.  Each additional person on the planet contributes to energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, food production, land and forest exploitation, waste removal, water and ocean pollution.

That richer nations have exploited poorer nations is indisputable, especially with the spread of multinational corporations and their grip on poorer nation economies.  But encouraging birth control in poorer nations is in no way related to that - it has been, from the 1970s, a realization that all nations are in trouble if the birth rate would continue to rise without limit.  And not fueled by rapacious industrialists, but by environmentalists, demographers, climate scientists, social scientists, etc.  Also by women's rights groups who recognize that women are better protected when they are not subjected to large number of births throughout their child-bearing years.  The rate of growth has through these efforts been reduced, but there is still much to be done in several regions of the world;  the UN's programs are still vital in many nations who are experiencing very high growth rates, rates that are harmful to their food supplies, social cohesion, environment, and wild life.

This is a poorly thought out documentary, and could have been so much better if the message it contains had been thought out with some degree of care and logic.",1484956800,2,1927,5.144230769230769
8698672,1,B00SJTEBO0,"Poorly made ""documentary"".  He finds a minor official in the UN who is afraid to say population is or is not a problem.  So the filmmaker takes that to mean it is not.  He goes to China and tells about the one child policy, and includes the Chinese claim that there are 1/2 billion less people on the planet because of it- fair.  He has people claim there is a plot by the rich nations to force lower population by the rich nations.  He does not go into how the rich nations, Japan, Germany, even the US would be dropping in population without immigration.  Unfair -rich nations have already dropped their birthrates.  He goes to a monument warning of overpopulation and because people deface it and claim satanic practices, he is equating population control efforts with devil worship - really unfair.  I can find monuments to great people or an idea in my city that are defaced with teenagers to say the same thing; it proves nothing but vandalism.  And he ends the movie by saying the entire population of the world can fit in Austria with more room than a prison cell and pictures of Africa without heavy urbanization.  He does not go into at all the concept of the contigo - the land and area is needed around a city for the collection of water, arable land for farming and ranching, disposal of garbage, forests and oceans to make oxygen, plants to make energy, products from the sea, phones, cars, homes, sand from rivers and beaches to make cement.  Or typography - put all those people in Austria (as he says can be done!) and most of them would die from the cold stuck on some mountain.  He claims that no one knows how many people the planet can hold.  Wrong.  Population experts - who he doesn't interview - state the planet can support about 2 billion people in something resembling first world standards.

I wouldn't be surprised if he got his funding from the oil companies or the Koch Brothers.",1450569600,2,1910,4.5276967930029155
8698673,5,B00SJTEBO0,"I enjoyed this unusual documentary, a starting point for a great debate.  Let's hear from some American Capitalists and The GOP.  This doc is naturally one sided because it not only goes where no man has gone before--oops, that sounds familiar--to give the Other Side of the Story.  I never expected to see a defense by The Whole Rest of the World against The Population Bomb Theory.  Within this doc is the familiar statement that, if it were Possible, to jam the entire world population, all 7 billion of us, into one small area, each person would simply occupy a livable few square meters of his or her Own.  Years ago this statement used a single American state as target.  The counter argument often cited is that you cannot forget all the infrastructure associated with each human, the water sewer electricity gas telephones internet TV etc.  Pile up all that corroded junk over under and around each human, and he or she would quickly expire from combined suffocation, lack of necessary hookups to an infrastructure, blocked communication to others, and claustrophobia.  No sky scraper would be tall enough.  Talk about over-crowding!  Finally, go back to Possible and admit that nothing like that 7-billion mass migration is even Possible.  Look at how stressed the world is right now with the refugees from wars, where to put them, who must submit to having new neighbors who do not understand The Language.  Wars have always been fought over territory.  Everyone wants room for themselves, their families, their animals, their crops, their religion, their God-given rights.  The Territorial Imperative is true.  And, as expanded in THE LOMOKOME PAPERS, people just Love War.
  Now, go back to the argument that family planning birth control is an American conspiracy.  If it is, why is the GOP fighting it so hard???  Why do conservatives hope things will just go away....to overseas?  Close those clinics, however useful they are, and just rely on Just Say NO?  Could it be that our motto is Do What I Say and Not What I Do?  Indisputably True is that many many places on Earth are way too crowded for healthy living.  This documentary POPULATION shows that in spades.  But what to do?  Just try and prove that Americans are NOT greedy, selfish, consumerist, deaf to other nations and their people.  Try to raise money for other desperate people and someone will say that The United Nations is a plot to turn the Earth into a socialist, commie, One World State by superseding American Exceptionalism.  Actually it might be easier to demonstrate that America is now a mixed union of both self-appointed and freely-elected Bosses, 1984 arrived, willing to enjoy travelogues from their easy chairs.  The future portrayed in H. G. Wells THINGS TO COME, a technocracy of billionaire information technologists wielding The Gas of Peace like bug spray from drones, may be here.  If population control is just a form of genocide, why wasn't Bush indited for waging the Irac war?  Oh, he was, by Vincent Bugliosi in another fine documentary.  Seems America is not good at blaming itself for any of the world's big problems?  Thank God, this is the year of documentaries.  Great ones like POPULATION.  At least there was no foreign mother holding up her starving baby to a lunch table of Americans, like in that horrifying cartoon by Gahan Wilson.  This doc is splendidly viewable like something from National Geographic, a subsidiary of FOX NEWS now?  OMG, says the character in Futurama with the Coke-bottle glasses:  I want off this planet!",1447286400,,3544,4.905723905723906
