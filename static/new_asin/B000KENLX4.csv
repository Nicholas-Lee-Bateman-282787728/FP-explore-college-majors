2688758,4,B000KENLX4,"This is a really good movie.  It's actually written by somebody with a good sense of humor (who is consistent with it).  The musical ""numbers"" don't seem forced or contrived.  It will entertain both adults and children without bringing up uncomfortable questions from your children.  In other words, no sexual innuendo or wondering why this story contradicts with that of another favorite holiday tale (unless your kids are extremely advanced).  So, the music is catchy, the characters are cute, the voice actors well-chosen, and the story is actually interesting.  I saw it on cable a couple of years ago and went out of my way to get it, because Christmas cartoons are often so horrible these days.  Don't get me wrong, it's not oscar-worthy, but it's as good as Rudolph.",1227484800,10,773,4.9
2688759,1,B000KENLX4,"NOT FOR YOUNGER KIDS.  TOO MUCH ADULT HUMOR.  my 3.5yr old saw this on the screen and wanted to watch This.  About 10 min in, she lost interest.  But kept running back to sneak a peek at the TV because she wanted to see Santa and the claymation is very attractive to kids.
But about half way through the movie, I came back into the room to check up on my kid and saw the scene where Santa was at the clubs with the reindeer and getting drunk.  Mrs. Clause was looking for Santa and found him in the clubs almost passed out and held up by the raindeer.  Its like ""Wallace and grommet"" meets Saturday Night Live.  Maybe I just walked into the room at the wrong time but this wasn't appropriate for small children.  Especially to see Santa in less than perfect light.  As a parent, you know what's best for your kids.  I just want to warn other parents to skip this movie and save your money.",1446076800,5,889,4.176470588235294

2688763,3,B000KENLX4,Not the best family Christmas movie but my younger child at least enjoyed it.  Would recommend for younger kids as the story can be a  bit boring.,1420156800,,146,4.37037037037037
