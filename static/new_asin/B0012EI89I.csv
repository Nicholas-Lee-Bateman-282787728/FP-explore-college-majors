8245618,5,B0012EI89I,"The ""Battlefield"" series is one of the most important television documentary series about the Second World War ever produced. Unlike other series, such as ""The World at War"", there are no interviews with either historians or participants and no descriptions of small-scale engagements, just the hard strategic facts of the engagement as seen by the top leaders. A considerable part of each film describes the run-up to the actual battle, with considerable use of maps, descriptions of the leaders, the commanders, the armies and the weapons that decided the engagement. What is emphasized is the importance of the battle within the whole strategic picture of the war. After this, a detailed presentation of how the battle played itself out is given. Finally, the strategic results of the engagement is described,
showing how the entire course of the war was affected.
This series is designed for someone who has more than just a casual interest in the history of the war, and I highly recommend it for this audience.

This particular film was very enlightening because there aren't many other documentaries that cover the naval and air war in the Mediterranean.  Whereas everyone who has studied about the campaign in North Africa has heard about how the British managed to intercept a large percentage of the supplies heading from Europe to Rommel's forces in Libya and Egypt, few details are provided in the other documentaries. From this film I learned much about the Italian navy which was highly respected by the British Royal Navy, the importance of Malta to the British, the unbelievably stupid decision by Hitler not to attempt to invade the island, satisfying himself with air attacks on the island and the British convoys bringing vital supplies, and the gallant Italians who in midget submarines and boats penetrated British bases at Malta and Alexandria, succeeding in sinking British ships, and the importance of the British attack using a handful of slow
Swordfish torpedo biplanes to sink Italian battleships at Taranto, which provided the inspiration to Japanese Admiral Yamamoto to plan the attack on Pearl Harbor.
I highly recommend this film, as well as the others in the ""Battlefield"" series for the serious student of World War II.",1352592000,2,2252,5.116847826086956
8245619,5,B0012EI89I,"I wasn't expecting much for the price i paid for this documentary..and have watched other WW2 documentaries 3-4 times the price as i paid for this one. I was surprised how good it was..it was very interesting footage and covered i think all the bases for the war in the mediterranean. Very sober , quality narration by a British narrator.

Great footage also.",1328659200,2,359,4.698412698412699
8245620,4,B0012EI89I,"This provides the average American, for whom WWII begins on 12/7/41,  an excellent introduction to the campaign in the Med before the US got involved. As an amateur military historian I must admit I learned a good bit about the naval and land campaigns in and around Greece and Crete. A worthy addition to my ""Battlefield"" collection.",1301788800,,334,4.859649122807017
8245621,3,B0012EI89I,"I learned a lot from this dvd. It is roughly 1 hour 38 minutes. It covers not a single battle but a series of large and small battles that comprised the Mediterranean campaign.  It is an overview of a campaign rather than a battle within a campaign.  It is almost too grand in scope.

It is different from the other battlefield titles that I have seen in that it does NOT follow the expected format.  The expected section breaks on the leaders, weapons, prelude to battle, aftermath, etc. that are the hallmark structure for the battlefield series is not followed. This format could not be used when covering a campaign vs. a single battle.  Still, I found myself missing the profiles of the various key armaments.

Instead you are given an overview of the major battles that took place in and around the Mediterranean from 1940 - 1943.  It is good material -but broad in scope and somewhat undetailed.  In each battle, the leaders are mentioned but not truly profiled.

The DVD uses many of the same images throughout the broadcast... italian planes flying overhead, british 8th army digging in, the scenes are representative of the actual events but are used 2-4 times in the program.  It is kind of redundant and causes the viewer to lose interest.

So although I respect the efforts of those who put this documentary together,  I had some dissappointment when it deviated from the expected format of coverage.  From this point of view, the program doesn't really feel like other titles in the series.

Still, as someone who is interested in the topic, you certainly won't be disappointed with what the show presents.",1267142400,,1620,4.759856630824372
8245622,3,B0012EI89I,"It seems to me that the War in the Mediterranean during World War Two has not been covered in the way it deserves. Granted it was a sideshow but none the less it deserves better than it has gotten so far.
  This DVD is a step in the right direction. While it is a light weight and should not be considered a magnus opus. It does cover a lot of area no matter how briefly of a lot of Places, Persons,, Events and Battles that deserve mention. I especially like the part on the Role of Malta that it played in the War. Also it did cover the fights in Syria and Eastern Africa that are usally overlooked. For the money its not a bad deal!",1217721600,4,635,4.031746031746032
