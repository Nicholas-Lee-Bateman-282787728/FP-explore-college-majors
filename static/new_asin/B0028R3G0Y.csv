Ermione is, to me, the most intense of Rossini's operas that I know.  The music scarcely let's up, driving us to the inevitable horror at the end. Why this opera has such a sad history of neglect I cannot imagine.",1473638400,,348,4.117647058823529
8356701,5,B0028R3G0Y,"In the current revival of interest in the total output of operas composed by the master Gioachino Rossini many unknown treasures have come to light. Among these is the searingly dramatic masterpiece Ermione. It is a Greek tragedy from Euripides (Andromicache) to a play by Racine (Andromique) to the libretto of the Rossini opera by A. Tottola. This was presented at the San Carlo in Naples 25 March 1819. For unknown reasons it was withdrawn after seven performances and not seen again until some hundred later. It was revived at the Pesero Festival. on 22 August 1987. The cast included Montserret Caballe, Marilyn Horne, Chris Merritt and Rockwell Blake. The first and only other DVD recording was done at the Glyndebourne Festival of 22 May 1995. This recording featured a brilliant display of Bel Canto technique by Anna Caterina Antonacci in a fine production by Graham Vick.
Before the current Rossini Festival DVD of 2009 there had been a CD in 1986 with Cecilia Gasdia and a CD release with the crew of this DVD recording in 2008.
Ermione is one long relentless march of tragic love and hate to a bloody tragic ending; an elegant royal lady injured and insulted by fate. I can understand that the 19th century Neapolitan opera audience was not prepared or could tolerate such horror filled, savage and morose staging impinging or their pleasant, well-ordered lives. This truly was a monstrocity as compared to  safe sane middle class life they led. They enjoyed Rossini's light-hearted ""Barber of Seville"", L'Italiana in Algeri"" and ""Centerentola"".  In Ermione there's not one tune a hurdy-gurdy could play on the street corners of Naples after an evening of Ermione. No, this opera is intense, so intense  and fast moving that is , to me, truly ""awesome"". Much like the tune filled R. Strauss of Rosenkavalier in his earlier tragedy Elektra. And awesome is what Sonia Gnassi is in this production. She is the royal princess, daughter of Helen of Troy and the betrothed of Pyrrhus, Greek King of Epirus. In the aftermath of the fall of Troy, Andromica, wife of Trojan Prince Hector and their Astianax along with many prisoners have been taken to Epirus. Unfortunately Pyrrhus falls in love with Andromica and casts Ermione aside. And the tragedy begins.....
Ganassi is most convincing as the abandoned  royal princess and her descent into madness is very well presented. ( I think the Ermione of Anna Caterina Antonacci in the Glyndebourne production  is more ""royal"" and the fall even more tragic)  All of the rest of the cast in this production are top-notch and excellent in their roles. The production is something else. I thought the Glyndebourne production interesting and digestible . The current production is, in a word, ""stupid"" or maybe just  ""silly"".
Overall, a great opera enthusiastically recommended - forget the sets.",1463356800,,2842,4.9831223628691985
