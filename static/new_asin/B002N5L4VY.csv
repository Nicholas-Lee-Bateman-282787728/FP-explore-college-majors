3955357,5,B002N5L4VY,"I have been looking for something to help close the gap in my abdominal muscles, and this video is definitely working! I can already see results after 4 workouts. There are two circuits, divided into 3 or 4 (respectively for circuit 1 and 2) seven minute segments, with a timer counting down in the bottom of the screen. As Tracey Mallett says, ""You can do anything for 60 seconds!"" She's right. She's motivational, pleasant, and has other moms doing the workout behind her, showing different intensities you can follow if you're not ready for the full workout. This workout is designed to be used with a couple of light weights, but after not working out for 6 years, I didn't use them the first few times and still found the workout a challenge. I am looking forward to getting my body back, and I know this DVD will get me there.",1311292800,8,832,4.516556291390729
3955358,4,B002N5L4VY,"This video is great: It's fun, Tracey is really cute and supportive, and it's very effective (I've lost 10 lbs in a month since I started doing this and Lindsay Brin's Post natal boot camp!). I really like that, unlike every other workout video I've ever done, Tracey's workout buddies actually look like they've had kids--they're not all ripped and grinning through the whole video. I also like that there's a countdown during each circuit so you never have to guess how long you have left: it makes it a lot easier to put your all into the exercises--and get maximum results--when you know you only have a couple of minutes left. My only gripe is that there isn't a specific section for targeting the abs, like other post natal videos I've done. Otherwise, highly recommended!",1311120000,,778,4.727941176470588
3955359,4,B002N5L4VY,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

The main tie in for mothers is that the backup ""dancers"" seem to be ""real"" mothers in all ""real"" shapes and sizes.  Some are in great shape, others not so much.  Also, the instructor's motivational conversation is centered around motherhood.

Pros:  Overall, this was a solid workout for me --- I do have to use heavier weights and modify moves to higher impact/speed when my heart rate is too low but I have to do that for most short interval style workouts.  I actually like short interval 10-20 minute workout segments that I can add on to other workouts or do all at a time for a full workout in itself.  Liked the mix of moves.

Cons:  Can't really hear music/moves not tied in to music so much.  Instructor does not really have the voice for this kind of thing and gets too shrieky to listen to for long.  If the DVD had the option for music only that would solve a lot of the problems.  At one point the camera was rather badly shaky/unfocused and I wondered why they didn't reshoot that segment but it was not a chronic problem.  Not crazy about the backdrop which I found distracting for some reason rather than feeling like something I could relate to.  Also, rather than having the ""real"" people, I'd rather have professional trainer-types with good form that I could watch and emulate.  Better yet, have one be a modifier for beginners/low impact and one be a modifier for advanced/high impact.",1307145600,3,1462,4.569230769230769
3955360,5,B002N5L4VY,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the instructor.

Like its sister DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-s-Lose-the-Belly-Flab/dp/B002GHHHHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett's-Lose the Belly Flab</a>, Get Your Body Back is part of fitness instructor Tracey Mallett's Super Fit Mama series, which also includes the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Fit-Mama-Stay-Fit-During-Pregnancy-and-Get-Your-Body-Back-after-Baby/dp/1600940315/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Fit Mama: Stay Fit During Pregnancy and Get Your Body Back after Baby</a>.  Mallett designed this workout with new moms in mind in several ways.  First, the workouts consist of two phases, ""Phase 1,"" which is shorter (about 25 minutes total) and uses light weights only, and ""Phase 2,"" which is a bit longer at 32 minutes and uses two sets of weights.  The second way in which this DVD is tailored to new moms is that each phase is further broken down into circuits:  Phase 1 has three 7-minute circuits, whereas Phase 2 has two 6-minute and two 8-minute circuits (each phase also includes a 4-minute warm-up).

The Main Menu of this DVD reads as follows:
*Introduction
*Phase 1
*Phase 2
*Baby Cellulite Blaster
*Stretching
*Play All
*Circuits

Mallett works out on the same white living room-type set used for Lose the Belly Flab.  The 4-minute warm-up, which plays automatically when you select either phase, features Mallett alone.  She begins with simple marches, side steps, and squats, and performs some flexion/extension for the back.  She then does static stretches for the hip flexors, calves, hamstrings, and quads.

For Phase 1, Mallett is joined by two background exercisers, Ariele and Kristina, who is modifying.  She begins with a plie squat that moves into a side lunge with bicep curl.  (Note:  almost all of the strength exercises involve compound movements.)  Next comes a rear lunge with an overhead press, and then the first cardio, twists with a knee in.  This is followed by pulsing squats with a little jump.  For the second circuit, Mallett performs a side lunge with a punch followed by a back row with a rotator cuff pull (scarecrow).  For cardio, she does a hopping twist.  This is followed by more shoulder work, a waist twist, and then gallops with split jumps.  The last circuit starts with a traveling side plie with shoulder raise; lunge with back work follows, and then the first cardio is a jumping v-step.  The strength work concludes with a windmill row and a plie with rotator cuff work; the final cardio is side kicks.

Andrea and Melanie are with Mallett for Phase 2, with Andrea modifying.  This time, Mallett starts the strength work standing in 4th position with an overhead press and then moving to triceps kickbacks with a side kick.  For cardio, she does jumps out and in.  Next come static back lunges with a twisting row and side steps with a ""present"" to the front; the cardio is a side steps with an optional jump.  For the next circuit, Mallett begins with a side lunge/fly, coming in for a tricep extension, and then, single leg lunges with row.  Cardio is step touches with rock.  This is followed by one-legged squats with row, shoulder work in plie, and gallops to kicks for cardio.  With two more circuits left, Mallett performs a walking lunge with bicep curls and then the same back row with rotator cuff pull (scarecrow) from Phase 1.  For cardio, she does ski rotations.  Mallett moves down to the floor for the next strength segment, which includes plank pose with alternate knees in and push-ups.  But then it's back to standing for curtsey squats with a side leg lift and ballet jumping jacks.  For the final circuit, Mallett starts with a squat lunge using one heavy weight; she then does a triceps extension with standing side crunch.  The cardio involves ""fast feet"" (a.k.a. football run), which is followed by what Mallett calls ""body builders"" (a.k.a. burpees).  The final moves in this circuit are a front lift with attitude leg and front/side kicks for cardio.

Since the credits roll at the end of each workout, in order to get to the 2-minute Stretching segment, you need to go back and select it off of the Main Menu.  Mallett is alone again here.  She starts standing but then moves on to mostly seated stretches such as butterfly, one-legged forward bend, and wide-legged forward bend.

At 9.5 minutes, the Cellulite Blaster is a nice little bonus which uses no weights and which focuses mainly on the lower body.  Again, Mallett is working out alone, and there is no warm-up or cool-down to this segment.  Instead, Mallett jumps right in with a side lunge/lift/curtsey lunge combo, ending with a pulsing curtsey.  Next, she alternates between squats and plie squats, pulsing between the two.  Coming back to standing, she lifts one leg behind for a pulsing rear leg kick, then slowly leans the body forward and returns to standing for balance work.  Mallett finishes on the floor for leg lifts from a side plank position.

This DVD was a nice surprise, mainly because I found the workouts to be significantly more challenging than I had expected.  I am not a new mom, and I generally consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser; I definitely felt sufficiently worked out during BOTH phases.  As noted above, I do think that the format of this DVD is excellent for new mothers, but at the same time, I also think these workouts would be best suited to those who were active BEFORE their pregnancies.  Others who choose to use this DVD to get back in shape should not hesitate to 1) follow the modifier, 2) use very light (1-2 lbs.) or even NO weights at first, and 2) only do as many circuits as current strength, stamina (and baby!) allows.

In the end, whether you are a mom or not--if you are an experienced exerciser who is crunched for time and who enjoys circuit workouts, Get Your Body Back just might be the perfect solution!",1306195200,4,6014,5.068158697863683
3955361,5,B002N5L4VY,"As someone who loved intense workouts prior to pregnancy (such as P90X), I wanted to find an intense, fun workout that targeted problem areas after the birth of my first child.  This workout is fun, and with smaller segments, even when my newborn needs my attention, I can always come back to the workout.  It's fun and there is a lot of variety to keep from getting boring.  I highly recommend this video.  Be sure to have dumbbells (3-8 lbs) and a resistance band.",1299196800,4,466,4.511904761904762
3955362,4,B002N5L4VY,I had my third baby less than 4 weeks ago and started using this workout about a week after.  The workout is broken down into segments all being less than 10 minutes each.  This is working great right now because the baby does not always cooperate and let you get in your workout.  It is challenging but definitely doable and easily modified.  The cardio bursts can be done either low or high impact and you can always increase your weight.  I started with 5 pounds.  I definitely recommend this workout.,1290643200,8,504,4.544444444444444
3955363,5,B002N5L4VY,I really like this workout. It has zero dread factor which I feel is very important when choosing a workout video. It has two different but challenging workouts that will have you sweating your butt off but will not leave you sore the next day. I think I will purchasing more of Tracey Mallet!!!,1290470400,7,295,4.481481481481482
3955364,5,B002N5L4VY,"I have never seen a video of Tracey Mallett's until this one and I am so impressed. First of all, you can see she uses her body right, in a way that if you follow it, you too will have great posture and lose the back fat and muffin top. Second, every exercise in here is a bona-fide no bullsh way to get results, all using the current knowledge about the spine, pelvis and abdominals, how to use them right, strengthen them, and how to keep them in tip-top shape while you lift weights and move aerobically. I am SO GLAD I found this! Ms. Mallett is the real thing.",1270425600,23,565,4.1454545454545455
3955365,5,B002N5L4VY,"This circuit style cardio & weights workout is great. I like Tracey but some of her workouts are not that good or challenging, however, this one is awesome. It's fast-paced and challenging but at the same time pleasant and doable. Forget the post-pregnancy marketing theme, this DVD is excellent and delivers a total body workout in under an hour for anyone. I'm a longtime exerciser and used to Cathe, Jari, Amy, etc. and I was surprised how challenging and efficient this was. Even the first part that is supposed to be easier and to get you back to fitness, is nothing for beginners. If you're intermediate to advanced, do the entire DVD and you will sweat and feel great! Great job, Tracey!",1270339200,36,694,4.69672131147541
3955366,5,B002N5L4VY,"I love all of Tracey Mallett's workouts, and this one is just as great as the rest!!

Get Your Body Back is an excellent circuit-style workout that will help you burn fat & build muscle...and get your body back!!  LOVE that the workouts are broken down into smaller segments for those super busy days, too!!

This DVD is a great compliment to her Quickblast DVDs.  While her Quickblast workouts are a little more cardio-intensive, Get Your Body Back will help you obtain more muscle definition while still burning fat!!

TRY IT!!  You won't regret it!!",1263945600,26,552,4.757894736842105
3955367,4,B002N5L4VY,"Bought this dvd to help get me back into my pre-baby body. So far so good. Unfortunately I can't do some of the workouts because I have bad knees and I wish she wouldn't zoom through the workouts like she does, but all in all great product. Arrived sooner than I thought so was pleased",1377302400,,285,4.2
3955368,5,B002N5L4VY,"This DVD is marketed as a ""bounce back from baby"" routine; however it is well suited for anyone looking for an effective circuit workout.  Each 6 minute segment combines bursts of cardio alternated by weight training moves.  There are low-impact, beginner modifications throughout.  The muscle sculpting uses light hand weights 3-5lbs to perform compound moves which incorporate the upper and lower body.  The heart rate really stays elevated for a good total body burn. DVD has chapter menus, including a core-focused segment.  Would highly recommend.",1372636800,4,552,5.447058823529412
3955369,3,B002N5L4VY,"I'm not a Tracey Mallett fan. I have several of her DVD workouts and although they are all good, I can't get past her voice and they move a bit quickly, even for this experienced exerciser. Good workout and production quality, though.",1351728000,3,234,4.595238095238095
3955370,5,B002N5L4VY,"I used Tracey Mallet's pre-natal workouts as well and really found them to be great. ""Get Your Body Back"" is challenging but doable. The circuits are short and seem to make the time go quicker. There are plenty of options and modifications shown. You will definitely feel the burn during and after the workout. My husband finds Tracey's voice a little annoying but it doesn't bother me at all.",1343088000,,393,4.7101449275362315
3955371,5,B002N5L4VY,"I bought this video after having my first baby two years ago, and I STILL use it. It was very challenging at first even though I am pretty active/fit (ran a marathon while pregnant), but you can modify everything, and the instructor explains how to do so. It's a very time-efficient work out where you work legs and arms at the same time, and you can make it more challenging by using heavier weights, which is what I do now. The best thing about it is that it's split into six to eight minute ""circuits,"" which is PERFECT for squeezing in between other tasks or when babies or toddlers are cooperative enough to play on their own for a few minutes. These days, I spend the morning in my workout gear and just do 8 minutes as I can, when I can. By the end of the morning, I've gotten through the video.

I looked at a lot of other post-baby videos, but most of them were either too easy or too much time commitment. This was perfect for me.",1339977600,10,940,4.222222222222222
3955372,4,B002N5L4VY,"This video is surprisingly effective for the amount of time it requires.  It is broken into 2 phases (1 is easier and you build up to phase 2).  Each phase is subdivided into segments.  Phase 1 has 3 segments of 7 minutes each, so you total 21 minutes of actual workout time (the warm up and cool down are separate segments for each phase).  Phase 2 has 4 segments that total 28 minutes.  You can mix and match if you want because the entire DVD is chaptered.  As you get stronger, you can do all 49 minutes of Phase 1 and 2 consecutively.  There is also an additional 10 minute Cellulite blaster that is all lower-body work.  The short segments make the workout go so much faster -- I thought they would be irritating or slow down the pace, but they do not at all.  There is a countdown clock in the lower-right hand corner that shows you how many minutes are left in each segment.  You are never more than a handful of minutes away from finishing your immediate goal, so it is encouraging.  It is a great concept.  I have seen a tremendous change in my body in about 4-6 weeks (my daughter is 1 1/2 years old but I did not get back to exercising until about 2 months ago b/c of medical issues).  I have lost weight and visibly slimmed my arms, hips, and legs.  It is a little light on Ab work (except for some standing obliques) so you may want to throw in some crunches yourself at the end.

The only criticism I have is that in one of the Phase 2 segments, when introducing an exercise (football runs), Tracey starts with ""Oh, we HATE these!"" which is the complete opposite of her very encouraging and positive (yet non-annoying) personality up 'til that point.  Then, she turns to the Mom doing the modified version and says, ""Come on, you can do more than that!  Go faster!""  That 60 second interval seems completely out of place with the rest of the DVD and should be removed (or silenced) if the DVD is ever re-released.  The exercise itself is fine (tough and effective, but doable).  It is her bizarre, out-of-character commentary that is a complete downer.  (If you are the type of person who is motivated by people who belittle you and criticize your effort as ""not enough,"" then you will not be bothered by that segment but you will find the entire rest of the DVD to not be for you.)  But for that 60 second segment, I would have given the DVD 5 stars.  I have not been this pleasantly surprised with a workout DVD in a very, very long time.",1337558400,16,2455,4.3238512035010945
3955373,5,B002N5L4VY,"Back before all this baby business, I used to go to the gym 7 days a week for an hour or more. I did cardio, circuit training, kickboxing, etc. In just 18 minutes I felt a burn more than an hour's worth of cardio and circuit training. Sure my post-pregnancy body isn't used to high intensity workouts; however I've lost more than my baby weight previously and needed just a little extra kick to work the target zones Tracey Mallett claims she can work. She does, she really does.  Previously I had been jogging 40 minutes a day with my little one plus belly dancing - an none of that compares to this DVD. Tracey Mallett is not only upbeat, but not annoyingly energetic. She smiles throughout the whole DVD and encourages you to as well. It actually helps in those situations when you really feel your inner thighs burning from the workout! After I master this DVD, it's on to more Tracey Mallett DVDs, she's a great instructor!",1336608000,13,928,4.491124260355029

This is a very efficient circuit training workout that combines low and high impact ""targeted"" exercises. She has someone who does low impact, but if you want to take up the intensity, you just use higher weights and jump instead of keeping it low impact. Tracey target's the shoulders, upper and middle back, along with legs. It's one of the best circuit workouts I've done.
