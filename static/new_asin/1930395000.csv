8324496,3,1930395000,"We were looking for a video to help our kids learn better table manners (and a few pointers for us as well). I think this video is too focused on elegant dining and does not have enough content for average parents and kids (things like passing food, excusing oneself, ordering in a restaurant, eating with fingers). It is very slow paced, with only Michele talking to the camera and little change of camera angles.
The best part of the video is a classy backdrop and her coverage of some basics like spaghetti, soup, etc. It is helpful and I didn't see other videos that looked much better, but I think parents should try a more family-oriented video first.",1056326400,,657,4.576271186440678
8324497,5,1930395000,"It is refreshing to find a video of table manners which finally offers table etiquette that is global in scope and Continental in flavor.  Michele graciously presents a savoir-faire of manners which any world traveler  would be envious to possess. This video is ""de rigueur"" for  anyone from Vail to Vienna who seeks to dine and entertain in premier style  and elegance.",956448000,,370,4.919354838709677
8324498,5,1930395000,"A very interesting video that is especially useful for the international traveler. When in Europe, table manners are especially important and many dining situations that one finds there are not common in the U.S. There is  also a certain amount of elegance to Michele's presentation and the  information provided should make anyone comfortable in many dining  situations. The instruction provided by Michele will also definitely make  dining more pleasurable. A must for someone who wants to learn or polish  their table manners.",954460800,3,529,5.402439024390244
