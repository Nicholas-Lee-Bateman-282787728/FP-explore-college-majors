8221417,1,B000W739NG,I was very disappointed with this product.  In a nutshell these are movie clips that are available free on the NASA Dryden film archive website.  This DVD is made-up of clips obviously ripped from the internet and it looks like it was made in someones bedroom.  The video quality is what you would expect from a disc of material taken from low-res internet clips.  AVOID!!!!!!,1301702400,6,376,4.7384615384615385
