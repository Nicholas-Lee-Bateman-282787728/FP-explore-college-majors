1818219,5,B00007KK51,"I actually went into this movie with some trepidation. I expected it to be kind of cheesy and lame, but I wanted something different, so I decided to rent it. I did it mainly because I am a big fan of Once and Again's Evan Rachel Wood (Emily) and she did not disappoint me. Emily is a girl who gets paid to keep secrets and she's also an aspiring violinist preparing for a big audition. Her mother is very pregnant and Emily is not too thrilled. Then, a new family moves in next door and she becomes friends with their son, Phillip. Eventually, the weight of secrets -- her own, the ones she's keeping for her job, and one that Phillip tells her -- becomes too much for her to bear alone. I really liked the ending as it allowed a cathartic release of Emily's big secret and it leaves the viewer with a positive message -- secrets are destructive and encouraging people to keep them is even worse. This movie is funny, uplifting, and refreshing. For anyone who doesn't normally like family movies, this one is for you!",1048464000,,1018,4.391534391534392

1818221,1,B00007KK51,"Sorry, folks who loved it, this movie did not engage me on any level.  How it can be considered good or wholesome family fare is beyond me.  I am a huge fan of Evan Rachel Wood's, whose exit from kid roles this surely was, but she deserved a better script and story, and worse, she photographed so painfully thin (we daren't use the a-word) it was distracting.
If satire is what closes on Saturday night, failed whimsy can't even get a tryout in Des Moines.  Played seriously or for laughs, or even as tragicomedy, this might have been a winner of a film.  As it was--too grim to be cute, and too un-kid-savvy to be of interest to any but the youngest children and the most sentimental adults--it's a mishmash that taxes every degree of suspension of disbelief. The female filmmakers know their homages and toss them around like confetti, lifting a little from this big-screen movie here and that TV sitcom there, but in-jokes do not a coherent film produce all by themselves.
True, no dogs were killed or toys chewed up by power mowers as in Lawn Dogs, but the spoofed exurban setting and wacky kids were there, as were the little paper bags that Mischa Barton pulled around in her little red wagon in the other movie, which was outright whimsy and therefore more successful even when it turned not only serious, but tragic. One of the wacky kids in Little Secrets catches cats in a butterfly net.  Riding bikes with those silly helmets was better filmed in My Girl, That Night and any number of other kid films of recent years.  There is even a grimy little boy Digging To China in his backyard (his secret, I suppose), but guess what, everybody?  Evan Rachel Wood made her movie debut in a very good movie of the same name when she was ten! How hip a homage is THAT?
I could only wish, watching Evan's mostly unconvincing moves as a violinist, that she had been ten again, and could get a legitimate laugh with setting up a lemonade stand-like ""doctor's office,"" like Lucy in Peanuts, by interacting with other ten-year-olds that were supposed to be her ""clients"" and paid 50 cents each for her ""services,"" part of which was hiding broken and stolen stuff in these little brown lunch bags.  But playing a 14-year-old going on 30, and looking as well turned out and coiffed as any sophisticated high school senior, E.R. reminded me that teenagers and little kids of today simply do not interact, no matter how much we might wish that they did, or that they did when we were younger, but don't any more. This meant, when things turned serious in the movie, as they did all too quickly, the descent into bathos rather than pathos was accelerated, the skids greased by making Evan Rachel Wood the youngest movie protagonist ever to have her very own Inner Child.
In terms of child stars with speaking parts, Little Secrets is the Movie Of The Year.  Even the kids who were seen but not heard, and there were far more of them throughout, will be able to look back fondly, along with their agents, and say they were part of it.  But as entertainment today, one star--with or without your kids in tow.",1046044800,3,3097,4.543985637342908
1818222,5,B00007KK51,"This is a true rarity:  a film aimed at families that everyone in the family can enjoy and relate to.  There is no pandering to the lowest common denominator here.  This is a movie with characters that ring true.  The predominently young cast handles their roles with a startling degree of excellence.
Real issues are tackled throughout.  To tattle or not to tattle?  Honor, loyalty, trust:  all explored with surprising honesty.  The meaning of friendship, and the lengths that people are willing to go to nuture friendship.
My friend's daughter and her friends viewed this film while I was babysitting them.  Despite the perfectly sunny afternoon, they stayed glued to the TV till the conclusion.  And you know what?  So did I.  Wholeheartedly recommended.",1045612800,,758,5.024193548387097
1818223,5,B00007KK51,"This movie delighted even my husband - who does not do the kid flick thing.  My children all loved it - age 6-10, though only the eight and up crowd understood all of the elements.  What amazed the adults is that here was a charming movie of an unusual but believable over-achiever who simply profits by keeping secrets for other children.  The characters we follow through the movie are entirely entertaining, although there were a few minor lapses in acting believability in some of the younger children in supporting roles.
The movie keeps the audience interested and entertained from one element to another as the secret keeper's own secrets sensitively unfold.  We considered this worth watching several times and that is not something we usually do.
The drama of the story is not quite Oscar Material, maybe a 4.5 stars, but for a family movie, Mom and Dad will be pleasantly surprised and satisfied that it was money - and time - well spent.  If you are looking for a stirring and entertaining movie for children age 8-100, this one should please everyone.  I strongly recommend this purchase.",1045094400,9,1100,4.824468085106383

1818239,5,B00007KK51,"Here's a movie that caught me totally by surprise. I'd seen it on my favorite DVD bargain rack for some time, but it just didn't seem like something of interest. Finally, I bought it because there didn't seem to be anything else suitable for viewing and it turned out to be one of the best movies I've viewed this year. The movie was sappy, sugar sweet and squeaky clean, not exactly my usual fare these days. The acting didn't seem particularly good, yet I got caught up in it and ""lived"" the last two thirds of the movie. It was touching, quite touching. The cast and setting presented about the most idealized family and neighborhood you could imagine and the assembly went through their hum-drum daily lives. Now how exciting could this be? Well, it wasn't exciting, at all. It was just a very nice group of everyday people going through their everyday hopes, problems, aspirations, and yes, their little secrets. It's hard to explain. Trust me. You have to experience it.

The movie was centered about Emily (Evan Rachel Wood), a teen-aged girl who had a neighborhood kids' business of keeping secrets for fifty cents each. It was a thriving enterprise and was quite a bit like a Catholic Confessional, and seemed to serve the same purpose. Movie-wise, it was a way of introducing the neighborhood kids and, ultimately even a few adults and a way of weaving a simple story together. Very interesting structure. Emily was an aspiring classical musician (violinist) who was trying for a symphony position and achieved it, ultimately, with the help of a couple of her friends. Now that just doesn't seem like the basis for an outstanding movie, but trust me, it was.

The setting was excellent, as was the photography. The soundtrack was exceptionally good and the DVD came with a bonus CD of same. I guess the acting was superb too, as was the directing. That is to say, in no place did I notice anything spectacular, but the movie captured me in a wonderful way that I'm not used to being captured and swept me away in the story. Why hasn't this movie achieved more note? It's a wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy.

1818240,5,B00007KK51,"There are many other reviews here that outline what this film is about, so I won't bother repeating it here. However, I do want to say what a great film this is! I happened to catch it on one of the cable channels here recently, and although I must admit I've never heard of it before, I was completely won over by this charming film from the very beginning! I found the storyline to be quite original, and there were many valuable lessons to be learned along the way. I'm sure this film was intended for young adults, but I'm much older than that and still enjoyed it very much! In fact, I liked it so much that I just purchased the DVD here on amazon! The cast in this movie couldn't be better, and they all give wonderful performances! Evan Rachel Wood is perfection itself in her role as Emily, and the chemistry between her and the supporting cast easily deserves 5 stars. More recently, Evan  co-starred with Larry David in the Woody Allen film ""Whatever Works"", and I couldn't believe this was the same actress! In ""Little Secrets"", she gives a very charming performance in what is certainly an excellent film for the entire family. In ""Whatever Works"", she gives a first rate comedy perfomance. After seeing these two films, I also checked out her break-through role in the movie ""Thirteen"", and saw still another side of Evan's great talent. In this, she tackles a serious dramatic role in a coming-of-age story about peer pressure that many young adults face along the way, and she handled the role brilliantly! After viewing ""Little Secrets"" and these other great films that she has made, I will certainly be wanting to check out some more! A great actress that should have a great future ahead of her!",1281571200,4,1713,4.598039215686274
1818241,3,B00007KK51,"I am really surprised there are are no reviews for this film as yet. Evan Rachel Wood is immensely talented and shines here. While the point of the film is that honesty is the best policy, which is true, there is a difference between ""honesty"" and matters that are private and no one else's business. This difference was not shown. Wood plays a sensitive, intelligent, compassionate 14 year old whose parents are having a baby. Of course an impending birth is exciting but it seemed to me that to the parents, it was all about the baby, and treated Emily like some kind of distant afterthought, even in  an accident. The two neighbor boys, Phil and David, seemed to have absolutely no sense of boundaries or respecting Emily's privacy, from ransacking her room to following her to treating her like an object, that they were ""giving"" to each other, or ""capturing"" for themselves, to the point of creepiness. This should not be presented to the girls seeing this film as acceptable behavior from boys. Girls should be allowed to choose to spend time together without an uninvited boy intruding or being called ""flakes."" Boys should not walk into a girl's home and watch her as she thinks she is alone, or break into her room and go through her things, without permission, as was done several times, to two girls. I just think that a film for pre and young teens should try harder to impart healthier values. I really would like to know what other people think.",1270166400,2,1459,4.655038759689923
1818242,4,B00007KK51,"We borrowed this movie from a friend for my daughters to watch in the car during a trip.  Both of my daughters loved it, but especially my 8 year old.  She wants to watch this every day, quotes lines from it, and talks about it.  It's a good story with good lessons for young kids.  With all the trash out there for kids today...this one stands out.  And my daughter wouldn't let me rest until I bought it for her after I had to return the borrowed one.",1246838400,,453,4.1022727272727275
1818243,5,B00007KK51,"This is one of those movies that is great for the whole family, young to old. It has enough fresh comedy to keep you laughing, and the proper drama to grip you and feel the emotion that the writers intended.

1818244,4,B00007KK51,"David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" starts with some great images: ideal suburbia - kids crossing the street, firemen waving as they go down the road on their truck, and a man watering his garden. Then the guy has a stroke and collapses. We are then treated to the best shot of the film: his dog playfully jumping around the squirting hose he continues to hold as a toddler ambles toward him. Then the camera moves down for a macro shot of the insect world in his lawn, introducing the film's theme that there is a secret and much nastier world just below the surface of ""Norman Rockwell"" suburbia.

In ""Little Secrets"", Emily runs a business which keeps all the neighborhood secrets in a safe place for a fee. It takes Lynch's dark theme and turns it into a lesson about friendship and trust. Apparently this thematic content is the reason the film was given a PG rating, although it is hard to imagine that anyone would think this film required ""parental guidance"".

The film features a decent performance from Evan Rachel Wood (Emily), although there is nothing here that would lead anyone to think she was capable of her breakout performance in ""Thirteen"". Michael Angarano (Phillip) is fantastic opposite Wood and they have a nice chemistry. David Gallagher does a good job in a small role that is unnecessarily tacked onto the story, presumably to capitalize on his ""7th Heaven"" popularly. Blair Treu, the film's director, should have recognized in mid-production that a better resolution would have been the pairing of Emily and Phillip rather than Emily and David. It was an easy fix, minor rewrites and re-shooting a couple scenes to make Phillip the same age as Emily, they certainly look the same age. Gallagher's drawing power did not save the production commercially (it tanked big time at the box office) so they ruined the ending for nothing.

The director of photography used a lot of great crane shots and creative camera angles but overall the the shots should have been tighter (i.e. closer shots of the faces and eyes). One exception was Caitlin E. J. Meyer (Isabelle) who the camera loves and who steals her scenes as the nine-year old younger sister of Emily's best friend. Isabelle has the movie's best line ""Life is complicated when you look like Claudia Schiffer"".

This is a very original premise, a well-conceived and rather profound story. It should really appeal to those who liked ""The Boy Who Could Fly"" and ""Harriet The Spy"".

There is one especially good scene when the web of secrets starts to crumble. First Emily is angry at David because he was caught drinking which was his secret, making David angry at Phillip for telling Emily his secret, which makes Phillip angry at Emily for telling David that he had told her David's secret. ""What a tangled web we weave....""

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1126051200,5,2843,4.766260162601626
1818245,1,B00007KK51,"While this film was engaging on many fronts, I could not bring myself to enjoy it. It injected a fantasy world into the minds of our young children, synonomous with an opiate. While I do enjoy children's films, I found it was not up to par with the latest in children's technology (Spy Kids 3-D is a good example of this). The acting was paralled by Keanu Reaves - outright silly! The story was not compelling enough to bring me to the edge of my seat. I could not recommend this film to any family household.

1818251,4,B00007KK51,"""Little Secrets"" stars Evan Rachel Wood from the television series ""Once And Again"" as Emily, a young teenage violinist who hopes to have a successful music career. While her friends are away at summer camp, Emily becomes a secret keeper. Children who are several years younger than her pay her to listen to their secrets and Emily is very good at keeping a secret. She knew she could do it when she was very young and decided it would be a very marketable skill. Emily also offers advice about  maintaining the secret to the children. When a new family arrive, Emily finds a very close friend and a potential love interest. Of course with friendships and potential relationships come complications, and Emily eventually learns that ""to be close to someone you can't keep secrets from them"". Throughout the story, Emily is very good at keeping other people's secrets, but underneath it all she is hiding a big secret all of her own, and that secret is... sorry- it's a secret!
When I first put on this DVD I had high expectations. I was expecting something very special like the movie ""A Little Princess"". However what I got seemed a lot more like ""The Babysitter's Club"". In saying that though, although not being a masterpiece, ""Little Secrets"" was not a bad movie. I have since watched it several more times and the movie is now growing on me. In fact I rented the movie first before buying it. And also, I'm definitely sure we're gonna be hearing more great things about Evan Rachel Wood.
The DVD features a Commentary by writer and director, a short Making-of featurette and a Blooper reel that is actually quite funny. The real bonus here though is an Exclusive soundtrack CD, which you'd be very surprised to find on a fairly minor release such as this.

7977575,3,B00007KK51,"it's a nice movie with a bunch of cute kids who seem all well educated and sophisticated.  However, the movie could have been an hour long instead of 1.5 hours.  The first half hour was great as it explains all the characters, but the second half hour was quite slow and didn't offer much more than what is known from the first half hour.  By the third half hour, suddenly the kids got weird with each other and that's when the story picked up speed.

The movie is about secrets everyone has, and how it can hurt many people because sometimes people lie to keep a secret.  The idea is a good one, but some secrets can hurt people badly if told, but the movie doesn't talk about it that way.  Overall, this is a good family movie with decent moral ideas.  However, as one reviewer said, the ending was not right in which the younger brother put so much energy in building a relationship with the young girl, who is the main character, only to have to give her up to his older brother who was only in the last part of the film.
