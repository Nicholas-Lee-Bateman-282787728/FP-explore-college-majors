8168124,4,B000MEYH2Q,"This dvd not only teaches you to juggle, but its highly entertaining as well. The host of the video does a great job explaining the steps to take to become a proficient - and one day maybe even a great - juggler. I highly recommend it!",1387497600,,235,4.130434782608695
8168125,4,B000MEYH2Q,"I'm surprised to see that this has no reviews so far.  Honestly, juggling for me is like trying to type without looking at the keyboard.  I've had it in mind to learn, I've made several attempts, had people try to teach me, etc. but nothing has stuck.  Then the kiddos and I heard about a juggling exhibition coming to town so I ordered ""Juggling for the Complete Klutz"" book and its set of juggling cubes.  I also ordered this DVD from our branch library.  I planned to have us make another attempt at learning how to juggle before we went to the show.

Well, the Juggling for the Complete Klutz kit was very well reviewed but it was like any other written tutorial - it didn't come alive for me and I couldn't get into it.  The cube shape of the juggling balls (designed not to roll away) also hurt my hands after a while.  I set it aside and figured I'd get back to it.  Then we watched this video and Steve Girman's method of ""toss toss catch catch"" had me and the kids on our feet trying it for ourselves.  And to my amazement, within an hour or two of practicing, I was actually juggling for a minute!!  It may sound foolish, but I have never been able to do that!

I completely credit this video.  It's not slick and it looks a little bit dated in parts, but it is so well done as a teaching tool.  Seriously.  He's encouraging, he's super clear, he goes slowly and he even repeats his tricks over and over so you don't have to keep rewinding.  There are beginner, intermediate and more advanced tricks.  The tricks are set on a video loop so they can be repeated as needed until you learn them - how cool is that?

I also like that the video has some personal touches of humor (didn't impress the kids but they're quick comments) but he doesn't stray into innane skits or interviews.  He sticks to juggling and it works.

We're going to return our library copy and buy this to have it on hand.  Don't let the dated look fool you - this has got to be one of the best juggling instructional videos out there.  Now someone ought to follow his good lead and re-make this with more modern kids and music and add amazing demonstrations (no vaudeville but more like extreme juggling) at the end like you'd find on a youtube search!  That would get a lot more attention than zero reviews (still surprised about that).",1375315200,2,2317,4.3125
