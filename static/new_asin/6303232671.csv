7842856,3,6303232671,"What I liked most about this film was of course, no question, Colin Firth. I really had to hunt this movie down in order to view it and while I didn't purchase it in it's VHS format here, I was able to view it piecemeal online.

I don't think it's a totally bad movie,  but I read an interview from Colin back in the day where he said the role paid well, he needed the money, and it  allowed him to be near his young son (Will), but he hoped this particular movie would never see the light of day again. He absolutely HATED it!

As I watched it I kept wondering what would make him hate it so? It was a rather flimsy plotline, like something I would dream up starring Colin and ME, but whatever. Then towards the end of the movie I understood why he probably felt that way about the film. It was akin to soft porn, not something I think he'd EVER want to be associated with. I actually felt bad for him. I don't think I recall ever seeing that much skin in the 90's on an R rated movie...not that I'm complaining. The following year of course,  was his breakout year as the beloved Mr. Darcy of P&P fame and the rest is history.

Still, even in a movie such as this, he was the best thing going in it. He was performing in a dual role and each one was believable on it's own merit. I'd never heard of the leading lady, Jennifer Rubins and haven't seen anything else from her so I've nothing to compare her performance with. I kinda wish I had a ""physical"" copy of this, yet still one viewing is enough for me.",1522972800,,1509,4.098305084745762
7842857,3,6303232671,Welllllllll.  It is not quite like anything else I've ever seen.  A pretty sick puppy of a movie and certainly a departure for Mr. Firth from his rom-com persona.  It had a twist of an ending I didn't see coming.,1482451200,,212,4.25
7842858,5,6303232671,See more of Colin Firth in this film than I expected...loved every minute.,1416009600,,74,4.769230769230769
7842859,4,6303232671,"One of Firth's firsts. Clever twists. He shows all the talent that would take him far. Jennifer Rubin makes a convincing change from a weak would-be starlet to a calculating actress. Firth apparently hated it. But as B movies go, it's a B+",1410048000,,239,4.5813953488372094
7842860,4,6303232671,I think this was one of Jennifer Rubins better earlier pictures. She and Colin Firth were very good in this one. I remember it from years ago. It was hard to find.,1404864000,,163,4.125
7842861,5,6303232671,"The movie seems like it was made for TV. But having said that it showcased a range of talent from Colin Firth and co star.
Well done. A welcome addition to Firth collection.",1373760000,,173,4.2727272727272725
7842862,5,6303232671,"ok, first off, this will not win oscars, but this is an incredibly smart script, and the acting all the way around is top notch. colin firth is great, but he does not ""save"" the film, the film itself is great. jennifer rubin is great as usual, and is not a slouch at all. dean norris and john getz provide their usual outstanding cameos.

  am very surprised at the critisism this movie gets. I dare you to guess the twists, and all the loose ends are tied up. this would get more love if it ever came to dvd, surprisingly, it has no dvd release.",1253318400,,546,4.180952380952381
7842863,2,6303232671,"Well, this is not Colin's best.  It is dangerously close to a thrown-together Hollywood hills soft core film.  It is rare to see him play nasty.  (He plays two characters actually, so his nastiness turns out not to be his real self.)  There's some mystery, some twists and turns, some skin. The other actors are wooden, plot is thin.",1221436800,3,333,4.593220338983051
7842864,5,6303232671,"Colin Firth is of course, awesome in the film, and if you're like me and enjoy low budget, and somewhat twisted thrillers, you will enjoy this. Mr. Firth's character alone makes the movie worth it. Excellent acting, as always, and the character is just... yummy, in a way. Great movie, but I admit, only because of Colin Firth.",1127088000,5,327,4.655172413793103
7842865,2,6303232671,"OK, here's the plot. A struggling actress hears from her friendly neighborhood bartender that there is this acting coach who helped some well-known movie star to the big time. So, she drives to his sprawling mansion in the Hollywood Hills, and undergoes some rather bizarre exercises to discover her inner talent...or something like that. Colin Firth plays the coach, who moves through rapid mood swings, keeps a mysterious room (complete with red light over the door), and looks great in various stages of undress. The plot gets a little murky after this, but, eventually she is led to believe that he is killing off the young actresses he is supposed to be helping, tries to escape, returns, kills him (she thinks), and is traumatized by the whole experience. Lest you think I am giving too much away, let me assure you, I am not. The problem is, after this, there are more questions than answers, pieces of the puzzle don't ever fit together, and I got the distinct impression that the writer/director simply gave up. Colin Firth does a credible job with characters not quite complete, while the female lead (whose name is not even listed on the video cover) rates a C- in acting ability. Granted, her role is also a bit vague. It is implied that she is an alchoholic, yet she quits drinking cold turkey with no problems whatsoever. At times she is a scared little girl, and others, a seductress. Then there is the confusion of whether the actor, who pretends to be the acting coach, is a sympathetic person or not, and if the acting coach is actually killed and, if so, by who?
I rented this one only because of Colin, and I'm afraid without his presence, it might have been a total waste of time. I would only recommend it if you are, like me, determined to see every film made by this man, good or not. Otherwise stick with Pride & Prejudice, Bridget Jones's Diary, or Fever Pitch.",1020384000,49,1887,4.619047619047619
