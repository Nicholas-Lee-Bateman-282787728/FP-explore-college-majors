8079107,1,B000ARTMS4,"This is a childish, new age film by an amateur film maker. The plot is disjoint and has no transitions that leaves it full of holes. It is a waste of time. A shame to all the great Mexican movies.",1510617600,,196,3.925
8079108,2,B000ARTMS4,"The trailer for this film unfortunately paints a portrait that is more interesting than the movie itself.  I was encouraged to watch the movie after realizing that it starred Vanessa Bauche, promotion for this particular film was strong considering her performance in Amores Perros (as Gael Garcia Bernal's love interest).

The result was a disappointing attempt at a coming of age story, which was both predictable and with no standout cinematography.  The plot holes and conclusion to the film also left me unsatisfied with it as a whole.  I was happy with Vanessa Bauche in Amores Perros, and was thus disappointed when her first big break as a lead actress was in a film that didn't deliver (by no real fault of her own).  My suggestion is to consider renting this movie before buying it, as it doesn't represent quality Mexican cinema.",1263427200,4,840,4.887323943661972
