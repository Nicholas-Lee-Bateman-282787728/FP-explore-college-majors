2171521,5,B00067BCBI,"For once, they got it right, offering a glimpse into the drama/suspsense of the early days in heart surgery, as well as giving a revealing look at two pioneering figures in the field - one well-known (the white doctor) and the other an unsung hero (his afro-american lab assitant). Neither saccharine or unrealistic, the film offers an unflinching look at both the genius and unbridled ambition of Dr. Blalock while countering it with the steadfast loyalty and dedication of his assistant, Vivien Taylor, destined to live in the doctor's shadow for much of his life. This is one I am adding to my personal collection. It is simply that outstanding.",1098316800,138,648,4.9
2171522,5,B00067BCBI,"This movie is an excellent example of how society has over shadowed the talents and contributions of African Americans for centuries.  The story of the ""Blue Babies"" is heart warming, but never get caught up in the medical smoke screen.

All Black Americans, young and old will enjoy this, and if we are honest, we have all had/ or will have the experiences of Dr. Thomas in one way or another.",1097539200,5,394,4.535211267605634
2171523,5,B00067BCBI,"Based on the true story of Dr. Alfred Blalock, a surgeon from Johns Hopkins Hospital, and his assistant Vivien Thomas. (Alan Rickman & Mos Def.) Surounded by prejudice, discrimination & racism; the two men learned to respect, and to ultimately benefit from their differences for the good of all. They developed the heart surgery shunt technique to prolong life for 'blue babies.' Although that's what the plot is about, it's not what the story is...

I shouldn't have liked this - not a fan of HBO 'original' movies, nor rap stars turned actors. Great movies are made by studios or independents, not networks. Great actors come from the world of acting; not singing, photography or sports. But the description sounded interesting, so I gave it a chance... WOW.

Excellent story, very fine acting, authentic looking cinematography, compelling and well-developed screenplay; and a real zing for your heartstrings. The particular subject matter is interesting enough, but the real story is the human relationships, both within/among the characters & American society. As we travailed through the growing pains of integration and striving for equality whether by race, gender or social class distinction; the story of how we coped and progressed has seldom been depicted with such artistic clarity.

Also, a real Believe In Yourself, Do What You Love, Don't Give Up kind of story. Not a perfect film, might seem a bit slow-paced at times for some, but very engrossing. Along with the lead actors who portrayed their characters wonderfully, Kyra Sedgwick also turned in another fine appearance. Watching it unfold it was easy to become involved, by the end I was very pleasantly surprised to be reminded that the brilliant young leading man was Mos Def. I certainly didn't expect such a performance, but gladly admit he's most definitely a fine actor. Glad to see it'll be available on DVD, definitely a MUST-SEE.",1097366400,12,1908,5.108974358974359

TITLE:  Something the Lord Made (2004)  NR  1:50:01
  Alan Rickman, Mos Def, Kyra Sedgwick, Gabrielle Union
  Joseph Sargent (Director)

  This movie tells the story of two real-life American medical pioneers, neither of whom will likely be familiar to you today  one because his contributions to medicine happened over seventy years ago, the other, tough he worked side-by-side with the first on those very SAME medical procedures, was considered by American society of that period to be a non-entity. I first saw this movie when it made its debut on HBO back in 2004  and, thought then, as I do now, that it was an excellent telling of a fascinating story. Since then, HBO On-Demand has usually made this movie available for viewing every two or three years, or so, for a limited time  and, every time that they did so, I watched it (at least once)  so, when I saw that it was available on DVD, this was a definite ""no-brainer"" purchase.

  Featuring Alan Rickman, performing in his usual brilliant manner; Mos Def, surprisingly (at least, to me) holding his own with Rickman; and, a great, well told, story. What's not to like? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.78:1  Color  480p  MPEG-2 (6.3 Mbps)

  Though this is a made for (cable) TV movie, it still (within the confines of the DVD format) looks pretty good. Its image features a slightly muted color-palette (which, I think, was probably done purposely in order to visually invoke the time period of the movie). The image also has good contrast and decent shadow detail. In addition, relatively fine detail (for a DVD) is evident in the brighter scenes and in many of the close-ups of actor's faces and their clothing. Also, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations to detract from the image. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has very good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the very pickiest of viewers.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 5.1 (384 Kbps)

  This movie's soundtrack, while doing nothing spectacularly, does everything at least adequately. The dialog is very clear and well-placed, with all voices being easily understood. The musical score is well-recorded, and well-integrated with the on-screen events. The surrounds, while not overly active, usually do an adequate job of conveying the on-screen location (the vast majority of which are indoors). Unfortunately, there is no deep bass  but, the content of the movie doesn't really call for it. This is a ""workmanlike"" audio presentation, that does not embarrass itself, and serves its visual presentation quite well. Most listeners should find that it has somewhat more than acceptable sound quality.

2171627,4,B00067BCBI,"An inspirational movie (well, if it's that good, maybe you have to call it a ""film"") about the development of the correction for tetralogy of Fallot.  It is a little heavy handed in its political correctness and the surgeries on newborns do not proceed quite the way they have it, but some of that is to be expected.  I briefly met Helen Taussig in the early 1970's when she came to the med school of the University of Iowa to give a lecture.  Unlike the actress in this depiction, she was tall and gangly.  It was a small auditorium and she was waiting at the podium.  I was one of the first in and went to the front row, pulled up the desktop and got out my paper and pen.  The residents, then in white uniforms, all headed for the back rows where they flopped into the chairs.  Dr Taussig came down to me and thanked me and then proceeded to give the lecture.  Contrary to a comment her character makes in the movie, women were not kept out at Johns Hopkins.  In fact, the medical school was founded with the express intent to educate women physicians, which at the time was not really revolutionary.  About one third of the graduates of the Unviersity of Iowa College of Medicine in the late 1800's were women (this changed with the Flexner report at the turn of the last century, when academic standards were tightened - if the MCAT -admissions test, which has been heavily weighted in scientific knowledge - were the sole criterion, 95% of physicians would
be men (see Martin Gross's book, The End of Sanity, on this).  There are nonetheless some great ones, and I am proud to have met, however briefly, one of them.",1496361600,,1622,4.445945945945946

I liked the Dr. Blalock character's portrayal too. Alan Rickman with a southern accent! Lovely. His behavior was believable as that of a real primadonna cardiac surgeon. (We had a famous cardiologist in the family and other heart related docs around. They were a difficult and arrogant bunch. Our cardiologist kin had to be arrogant to get from the slums of Brooklyn to be top in his feild. He was not quite as charming as the Blalock character, but had a wicked sense of humor.)

The script for this movie tries to look at the perspective of both its main characters. In interactions between the main characters and the worlds they inhabit, but only one of them has to actually live in both worlds; the other only has one world to live in. I originally got this movie because I love Alan Rickman. I didn't have expectations going into it because I've read a large mixture of them, but came out pleasantly surprised. It is a slow moving plot line, but given a chance, and if you pay attention to the fact it's based on a true story, it's quite an amazing movie! The acting is wonderful, and kept me hooked, even in the slow parts. Johns Hopkins made Thomas an honorary doctor of laws after he was appointed Instructor of Surgery for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, teaching his unsurpassed surgical techniques to a dozen, soon to be, renowned heart surgeons.",1480550400,2,1127,4.725888324873097

2171755,5,B00067BCBI,"This movie has contradictions for me.  It is based on the lives of a Doctor and his research assistant who solved two pressing medical issues.  The first was combat related, soldiers with fixable wounds dieing from shock.  The second made the Doctor a savior and his assistant the head of training surgeons at Johns Hopkins University Medical School.  They accepted the task of fixing hearts where the plumbing they were born with starved their bodies of Oxygen, ""Blue Baby Syndrome"".  Together they defied the belief ""you can't stop the heart for surgery"".  These men overcame prejudice and ignorance in there working relationship and in the world of medicine.  Today Johns Hopkins University Hospital displays both of their portraits in the gallery of medical pioneers who graced there institution.

Alan Rickman played Dr. Alfred Blalock the Heart Surgeon and Dante Smith (AKA Mos Def & Yaslin Bey) played Vivien Thomas the Research Assistant whose abilities made everything possible and in the 1950s was completely ignored by American Media.

The script for this movie tries to look at the perspective of both its main characters.  In interactions between the main characters and the worlds they inhabit, but only one of them has to actually live in both worlds; the other only has one world to live in.

This a great movie about real people who walked on boundaries of prejudice both in life and work.  They solved one problem and destroyed one prejudice together.  The other prejudices that touched them more for Vivien Thomas than Alfred Blalock are still alive and in some places more active than ever and claiming more people into slavery to EVIL than ever before.",1473120000,4,1673,4.996389891696751

2171760,5,B00067BCBI,"Several years before this movie was produced, I had watched the fascinating story of Vivian Thomas and Dr. Blalock on PBS.  So when HBO made the story into a movie, I was at once curious, being that a southern doctor would be placed by a British actor (albeit one of my favorite) and Vivian Thomas would be played by Mos Def, as all I knew of him was that he was a rap artist.

As most of the other reviews state, both gave flawless performances...perhaps to be expected from Alan Rickman, but not necessarily from Mos Def.  I have to say, if he did not win an Emmy or some award for his performance, he was robbed.  Mos Def brought such quiet dignity and strength to the role, he moves you to tears.  I have to believe that if Vivian Thomas were alive he would be proud in his humble sort of way.  The movie is every bit profound as the story itself.  You won't be sorry you watched it and it will stay with you for a long while.

Plus, being someone who also pays a lot of attention to a soundtrack (because soundtracks can enhance or ruin a movie, in my opinion) I have to say that once again, Christopher Young has perfectly scored and captured the right tone.",1469232000,,1164,4.235294117647059
2171761,5,B00067BCBI,Great story line that drive home the truth. It really is a recount of what actually happened between two brilliant men and highlights social racial tension.

2171851,5,B00067BCBI,"Here's a dandy little 2004 movie that slid in and out of the multiplexes before we noticed. HBO can do that sometimes.

The movie starts in the 30s with the economic issues wrought by the Depression, followed by WWII with a massive number of military personnel whose lives were saved because they were prevented from going into shock by a technique developed by Alfred Blalock, played by Alan Rickman (""Harry Potter,"" ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"").

This real-life surgeon was ably assisted by his under-employed lab technician, Vivian Thomas, played by Mos Def (""The Italian Job"" and ""16 Blocks""). In ""Jim Crow"" Nashville, it was never considered appropriate for a black assistant to receive any credit for his contribution, so Thomas was not honored for his valuable input.

When Blalock was promoted and transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital, he prevailed on Thomas to move his wife and two girls from Nashville to Baltimore despite the hardships it caused. Even though he worked side by side with Blalock in his laboratory, Thomas was classified as a Class 3 Laborer on the payroll and was paid accordingly.

Consequently, while Blalock lives a life of luxury and ease, Thomas has to do part-time handyman work to help pay the rent.

At Johns Hopkins, as Head of Surgery, Blalock is determined to develop a treatment for ""blue babies,"" babies born with faulty hearts, doomed to an early death. He and Thomas finally devise a technique that they think will work. They do the experiment over the strident objections of all the powers that be at the hospital and in 1944, open-heart surgery is born.

This is an excellent snapshot of the 30s up to the 60s, with the social upheaval, civic unrest and turbulent times for racial issues. Mos Def is wonderfully directed and has given us a performance he can be proud of. Naturally, our old work-horse Rickman, is flawless...this time with a mild Southern accent!

Mos Def was the star as far as I am concerned but Alan Rickman is a favorite of mine. This is a little known story of the cure for Tetralogy of Fallot in newborns (known as Blue-Baby syndrome back in the day). Spoiler alert: the rapper Mos Def, now known as Yasiin Bey, carries the story of a black man hired as a janitor at Johns Hopkins Hospital, but who given a chance in the research lab invents a device that helps in remediating fatal neonatal cyanotic heart defects. A friend who teaches middle school showed the movie to her students. They were thrilled and excited and were motivated to do more research.",1436572800,3,790,4.380952380952381

Mos Def actually does a wonderful job (who knew he could act).  The terrible
discrimination in the time period is dramatic, even keeping Thomas out of
the operating room until Alan Rickman's character demands loudly that Thomas
be admitted to assist in a surgery.  Overall, this is a wonderful story.",1433289600,3,381,4.846153846153846

It is a slow moving plot line, but given a chance, and if you pay attention to the fact it's based on a true story, it's quite an amazing movie!  The acting is wonderful, and kept me hooked, even in the slow parts.  Your feelings also go up and down with the characters.  Not my favorite movie, but a good one none-the-less.  There is some cussing in it, but it's not overbearing.  I don't think many young people would appreciate it as much unless they have a taste for medicine, or are interested in blue babies/heart surgery.",1431907200,7,706,4.511811023622047

2172144,5,B00067BCBI,"My review is brief and to the point.

Being of African American Decent, I was very proud of the contribution
made to the medical community  that would exceed racial lines as to
the overall benefit to our society as a whole.

From a spiritual point of view, when we work together as loving human
beings, we exceed the hatred and bigotry that Satan promotes. Satan's
goal is to kill, steal and destroy but when we combine our God given
talents, we exceed the ""snake Line."" (Satan's domain)

Very entertaining with a profound message. Let us not destroy our
United States of America from within as the Romans did to their
society. If we truly want God to Bless America, we must display
""LOVE,"" towards our fellowman and combine our God given talents
to survive in the future.

2172251,5,B00067BCBI,"Really interesting story of the collaboration between Alfred Blalock, a famous Southern White heart surgeon, and Vivien Thomas, a brilliant self-taught African American surgeon.  Their invention of the operation to correct the Blue Baby defect was an interesting process.  Both contributed key ideas and techniques, but Thomas's access to schooling and many other spheres of life were limited by segregation and discrimination.  Blalock was mostly very respectful of Thomas, and they worked very well together and with their assistants and students, but he did not always give him full credit publicly.  Thomas, however, was revered by the med students for his perspicacity, integrity, and courage, and, in the end, the hospital, Johns Hopkins, elevated Thomas to full status as a major star surgeon at the med school and mounted his portrait in a place of honor.  Events in the film are interesting, poignant, and dramatic.  I want to read his own biography now.",1419120000,6,963,5.261437908496732

2172314,5,B00067BCBI,"This is the very stirring and true story of a medical partnership which resulted in the development of the Blalock-Taussig shunt, which revolutionized pediatric cardiac surgery.  It highlights the role of Vivien Thomas, an African-American surgery technician, trained by Blalock, but whose role and position in a very Southern oriented Johns Hopkins Hospital of the 1940's placed severe constraints on Thomas' position.  It is heart-warming to see Thomas advance and progress despite these social limitations, until he finally receives some of the recognition and accolades he so richly deserved.  Happily this occurred while he was still alive.
Thomas' instruction in surgical technique to medical students and residents alike was his best legacy.  These grateful men and women commissioned a painting of Thomas to hang in the Hopkins Hospital.
This film is a glowing tribute to both men, and to the wonderful partnership they had over many years, and is a celebration of the life-saving operation they created.  It is a truly wonderful story!",1412985600,4,1044,5.380368098159509

Stellar performances by Alan Rickman and Mos Def bring this true story about the pioneers of Heart Surgery alive. I have seen the movie about 10 times, and if it comes on HBO I can't turn away from it. Rickman uses the F-word a couple of times which may be offensive to some people but if you can get through that the emotional payoff of this story is worth it.

2172455,5,B00067BCBI,"I'm writing this review in defense of a great movie that's been slammed by some of the reviewers for different personal reasons.  Bottom Line, this movie is about saving lives, Baby's Lives. And the road to saving those precious infant lives is full of failure, frustration, anger, unfairness and miracles.

It's based on a true story and seems to accurately depict the racial attitude that existed in America during that time.  A lot goes on in the relationship between the two main characters, but as always in great movies, it's the things that are not said that make the story so captivating.  You get to see not only the growth of two men, but also the evolution of surgery and surgical procedures that have made a difference in how heart valve problems are treated today.

Maybe those who griped about the movie were misled by the title. It's not about the son of God, but it does show the gift of God in the hands of human beings. What better gift for man than to be led to discovering a way to mend a newborn infant heart?

I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing how with medicine and innovative medical procedures, doctors/surgeons have triumphed over many health defects to save patients lives.

People of our generation don't always understand the struggles that black people have had to overcome in a society that at one time thought they were only able to do jobs of servitude. Even though our society still treated minorities as ""less thans"" we have come a long way and often forget the distance we have traveled as a society. We need to remember those struggles so when we begin to think of others as ""less thans"" we can be reminded than any person can be capable of anything and nothing, not color, not preconception, not language, not birthplace should hold a person back from doing what they are capable of doing. So often we are not aware of the people who have contributed to furthering science because their stories fall into the background and the big named people take the credit. These stories need to become part of our national memory to remind us no one, not one person should ever be thought of as ""less than"" anyone else.",1388620800,2,976,4.582857142857143

Before this doctor and his assistant dared to make these breakthroughs the medical world considered the heart untouchable. This is a story of encouragement and believing when no one else believes.

2172549,5,B00067BCBI,"This movie seems interesting since it is based on true story and particularly because most of the events took place in Nashville and Vanderbilt Medical School. The film is about an outstanding achievement for the first time in the field of medicine in the mid of 20th century and in the history of the United States. It is about heart surgery on blue babies. The film dramatizes the passion of Dr. Alfred Blalock and his lab technician Thomas Vivian. Vivian first works as janitor in Dr. Blalock's lab; he is promoted later to lab technician after Dr. Blalock realized that Vivian is a gifted and intelligent man whose assistance helped him in his research on blue babies.
Vivian is serious in his works and he is promoted to lab technician. He is pretty much familiar with using surgical instruments that draw Dr. Blalock's attention in keeping him as his assistance in the lab. That is why Dr. Blalock takes him to John Hopkins's Hospital where they pursue their research and medical careers. A question comes out here, will Vivian get any credit for his achievements? The film provides a satisfying answer to that question.
Dr. Blalock and Vivian both oppose the rules of their time and they trigger a medical revolution against racial segregation. There are some certain scenes in the movie that inspire me and affected my feeling such as;
* After the bank is failed and Vivian loses his savings; however, he is planned to use this money in order to accomplish his dream which is attending college.
* When Dr. Blalock becomes nervous of Vivian since he doesn't know what the smoked drums is so as he could have used to record data in the experiment. Dr. Blalock rushes out to get him after seeing a bunch of anatomy sketches on heart drawn by Vivian; then he apologizes to him and brings him back to work again.
* Vivian's salary degradation and classifying him as level 3 technician
* Some doctors rumor around the lab and they're murmuring"" Look at this, Vivian is achieving surgery and is assisted by chief surgery.
* Only 2 doctors agree to attend the operation with Dr. Blalock on the first child , the rest are skeptical and they don't attend.
* A doctor tells Dr. Blalock, ""you are dangling your reputation on a cliff; you are rushing this because you do not want to admit to the parent since you spoke too soon.
There are also scenes in the movies that have pleased me and make me happy such as;
* The speech of Dr. Blalock to the doctors invited to his home.
* Dr. Blalock says in response to a doctor discouraging him in doing the surgery on the girl ""When you see risks, I see opportunity""
* Assembling the new respirator machine by Vivian which pleased Dr. Blalock too
* Making the small clamp from pieces laying around in the lab
* When Dr. Blalock tells a doctor ""His hand (Vivian's hand) is important to me""
* Dr. Blalock doesn't start unless he brings Vivian into the operation
* Thomas Vivian's official recognition in the hospital and honoring him with a degree in medical surgery.

CONCLUSION :
As I see in the movie and like I expected, Vivian is honored, respected, and credited by the officials of John Hopkins's Hospital. The devotion and courage of Dr. Blalock combined with the precise and hard working of Vivian led to the achievement of the most complicated heart surgery. Today, only in the United States more than 2 million heart surgeries are performed whose origin can be traced back to the revolutionary work of Dr. Blalock and Vivian.",1380240000,,3471,4.634740259740259

Alan Rickman plays the surgeon who is truly rude, egotist, full of himself, yet relies so much on an African-American before the Civil Right movement.

I sent it to my brother who is an ER doctor when he was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan with the Air Force. He LOVED it - as did his buddies. He left it behind for the next and future medical staff. My ER doc brother thought it was an excellent addition to the library there. And he loved that it was a story of a fellow surgeon who, along with his amazing technician, came up with many lifesaving cardiac surgical procedures.

An absolutely superior movie about an amazing and unlikely relationship between a headstrong, brusque cardiac surgeon, and his humble yet dignified surgical assistant, in a time in the South when blacks and whites didn't exactly get along and sure didn't socialize or work together in public.",1371081600,,863,4.567741935483871

It does a good job showing the process of making a medical discovery. It shows the technical and natural and social obstacles. It also raises lots of questions about collaborative work and personal relationships. It does not simplify the story and make one guy the victim.,1370649600,,383,4.818181818181818

2172640,5,B00067BCBI,"This was a very moving movie about the quality of life and the unexpected turns it can take.  It really makes you wonder about the value of credit you receive from the world around you.  Do you really need it?  Or is it enough to know you changed the world without anyone noticing you for it or giving you any form of compensation?  Won't God ultimately compensate regardless?  Still, if I were the main character in this movie, I probably wouldn't have handled his situation as maturely as he did.

So if you're an ambitious person, wanting to push the limits, don't do it hoping to get a reaction from others.  Do it because you want to see something new and no one else plans to do it.  Easier said than done.  And this movie does a wonderful job of demonstrating the complexity.  It's highly philosophical.",1368662400,,810,4.486301369863014

A Southern surgeon is invited to join the faculty of Johns Hopkins.  He brings with him his lab assistant, a black man whose work he respects and depends upon.  On arrival in New York the doctor is welcomed through the front door while his black friend and co-worker must go around to the back where he's taken for a janitor.  Out of this mess the lab assistant discovers and devises the method for curing 'blue babies', and from that the field of heart surgery.  The most remarkable thing is that the story is true.  Alan Rickman and Mos Def are superb in Something The Lord Made.  I gather it began life as an HBO mini series, and in the joining together it becomes a little - just a little - long, but it holds together and makes for a MOVING picture.

2172704,5,B00067BCBI,"This is an amazing true story, and the acting, writing and production are top notch! It starts in Nashville, TN in 1930 with a black finish carpenter with a high school education losing his job due to the depression. He finds a job as a janitor cleaning the research lab of an up-and-coming white surgeon. The surgeon discovers that his new janitor has an unusually keen mind and manual skills and begins to use him as a lab assistant. The relationship that develops between them is a true meeting of the minds and is astounding considering they're in the South in the 1930's. The black man, Vivien Thomas (played by Mos Def), is truly brilliant. He conducts much of the surgeon's research on his own and becomes a major factor in making it possible for the surgeon, Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman), to perform the world's first open heart surgery, which takes place at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. The film develops the social/historical context and the personalities in the families in considerable depth, and one cannot do it justice in a short review. This is a thoughtful, sensitive drama, not recommended for those who like movies full of violence, sex and coarse language, but not a chick flick, either. One of the best movies I've ever seen. The extra features include a historical slide show with photos of the real people who were involved and commentary by the director, writer and another person - the only commentary I've ever listened to all the way through.

United in the Johns Hopkins medical labs, privately their lives were strictly separated, due to the racism common in the 1950s; this led to the peculiar circumstance of Thomas serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Only in 1969 did Johns Hopkins officially recognize Thomas's achievements and hang his portrait next to that of Blalock, and in 1976 awarded him an honorary doctoral degree in acknowledgement of his decades of training Johns Hopkins surgeons.

2172749,5,B00067BCBI,"""Something the Lord Made"" is one of the most moving films I've ever seen. In 1930 in Tennessee, Vivien [NOT Vivian] Thomas, a 19-year-old African-American man, unable to afford schooling, finds a job as janitor to a white, 30-year-old Vanderbilt surgical resident, Alfred Blalock. The janitor soon becomes lab technician, and a rocky, lifelong (unequal) partnership is formed.

Alan Rickman is masterful in his portrayal of the brilliant, driven surgeon who must face his own prejudices to first recognize Vivien's brilliance, and then to acknowledge the injustice in the ways black people are treated. He struggles with an unwillingness to buck the system, and some reluctance to share the glory, to make sure Vivien is credited for the work he does. His societal blinders and single-purpose focus are slowly widened as his respect for Vivien grows.

Mos Def, as Vivien Thomas, is the heart of the film. He has the acting skills to give the role the strength and sensitivity it requires. Even with the moving script, a lessor actor might not have been able to do this role justice. And for Vivien Thomas, my heart will always ache more than a little that he had to struggle so hard, and would never live in a world where he got everything he deserved. Part, but not everything.

Several reviewers commented on foul language and one expressed concerns about showing the film to teenagers. I prefer fact to fiction. Surgeons under pressure sometimes curse; it would be unrealistic to portray these lives any other way. Anyone old enough to understand the social issues has heard these words before. It would be a tragedy to deprive a teenager of the many gifts this film brings. Call me degenerate for not taking offense at the cursing, but, without reservation, I whole-heartedly recommend it for teenagers and adults, alike.

I would not have gone past the first few minutes if a young person or teen had been present, but I stuck with it for about 25 minutes. Wish I hadn't! I cannot believe HBO rated this as acceptable for all audiences. I also cannot believe that a professional doctor who is worth anything would lower himself to continual gutter language.

2172796,5,B00067BCBI,"Kindness and virtue come from the heart, and should be performed without thought for the opinion of others, or of future rewards. Leo Tolstoy

True story: 1940s Vanderbilt surgeon Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) hired carpenter Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) in his dog research lab. Thomas impresses Blalock with his rapid intellect, curiosity, manual dexterity, humor and inventive flexibility.

Blalock takes Thomas with him North to Johns Hopkins. Dr. Taussig, noted for her ability to diagnose via palpation instead of auscultation, brings a blue baby destined to die within 6 months to Blalock. Blalock and Thomas wrestle to recreate a model of a blue baby in the dog Anna (now immortalized in a portrait at Johns Hopkins) and then cure the cyanosis.

A friend who worked with us at the Gallup Indian Hospital in 1971 suffered the loss of his first born, a son, to Transposition of the Great Arteries, blue baby syndrome.

Surgical dogma at the time proscribed touching the heart. Blalock and Thomas broke tradition as a mixed race medical teaching partnership during the era of segregation, pioneered heart surgery on an infant, created new surgical techniques and invented ground breaking miniature instrumentation.

5 star inspiring true story of risking on the frontiers of medicine to offer guidance for generations of physicians and hope for families.

I had the good fortune to do research under John Norman, MD surgeon, on a totally implantible artificial heart at Boston City Hospital in the 60s. Dr Norman moved to Texas to work with Denton Cooley on the Abdominal Left Ventricular Assist Device. Dr Cooley was one of Dr Blalock and Dr Thomas' residents.

It is important to teach children kindness and simplicity in life and work. All of children's moral and spiritual education should be supported by your own good example. You should live virtuously, or at least try to do so; the success of your good life will educate your children.  Leo Tolstoy

Dr Alfred Blalock struggles with this conflict of being friends with Vivian Thomas, his lab assistant, and just using his talents to help himself.

Based on a true story, this movie focuses around Vivian and his talents in the art of refining and creating important surgeries. However, his inability to have an education stops him from raising his station in society any farther than it is.

From 1930-1960 when most of this movie takes place, you can imagine how difficult it was for him.

This Emmy-winning HBO film is simply outstanding in every way; the script, based on a true story, is exciting and the actors are all excellent.

But Thomas' remarkable manual dexterity and scientific acumen shatter Blalock's expectations, and Thomas rapidly becomes indispensable as a research partner to Blalock in his first daring forays into heart surgery. The film traces the groundbreaking work the two men undertake when they move in 1941 from Vanderbilt to Johns Hopkins, an institution where the only black employees are janitors and where Thomas must enter by the back door. Together, they boldly attack the devastating heart problem of Tetralogy of Fallot, also known as Blue Baby Syndrome, and in so doing they open the field of heart surgery. The movie dramatizes their race to save dying Blue Babies against the background of a Jim Crow (Racial Segregation) America, illuminating the nuanced and complex relationship the two sustain. Thomas earns Blalock's unalloyed respect, with Blalock praising the results of Thomas' surgical skill as being ""like something the Lord made"", and insisting that Thomas coach him through the first Blue Baby surgery over the protests of Hopkins administrators.

He must clean the dog kennels for Alfred Blaylock, M.D. surgeon, overbearing, supremely confident descendent of Jefferson Davis and racist by today's standards.

It isn't long before he notices that Thomas is reading his medical books and he begins pushing him to operate on research anmimals, which he does with singular skill.  In twelve years, Doctor Blaylock's research in shock and trauma earns him a position as head of surgery at Johns Hopkins in MD. He turns down a position in Michigan because they will not accept his lab assistant, and Blayock will go nowhere without Vivien Thomas.

Enter Doctor Taussig a medical doctor who meets Blaylock in his home where Vivien Thomas is serving drinks to his guests. She asks the good doctor to pioneer a surgical procedure for ""blue babies,"" so called because they do not have enough blood flow to the extremities. While Mr. Thomas is serving drinks and listening to the conversation, he is adding his two medical cents to his mentor. With more curiosity and respect than pique, she demands, ""Who are you?"" Dr. Taussig and other guests like Drs. Denton Cooley and William P. Longmire will soon learn of Thomas's knowledge and skill.

As in real life, Thomas helps Blaylock overcome the dictum, ""do not touch the heart."" He creates special clamps, stitches, and procedure for blue baby operations. Thomas has the magical ability to operate with his eyes closed. He will assist the ground-breaking operation of open-heart surgery, but will not get any of the credit.

Heartbroken and feeling betrayed by the exclusion, Thomas tries to pursue college and a new career without success. He humbles himself returning to Doctor Blaylock where he teaches residents surgery. He finally receives an honorary degree that doesn't quite match the level of respect and admiration that hospital staff have for his achievement and skill.

There's nothing like a good book, but there is also nothing like a good movie. Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blaylock superbly. Very progressive by World War II standards, he is woefully bigoted by today's, and is perplexed at Thomas' disappointment in him. Mos Def too, plays the respectful and self-respecting Vivien Thomas to perfection. He will not tolerate Dr. Blaylock's temper tantrum and returns money to another doctor who insists he get coffee and a donut for him. Both play from a superb script. The single piano as background was the perfect accompaniment to the triumphs, disappointments, frustration, and sadness of the show.  I found several parts in this feature I wanted to play again and again, and there are too many favorite parts to catalogue them here. HBO has made another movie that nourishes the soul and, of course, the heart.

We all are indebted to Vivian Thomas for paving the way through his innate skills and self-taught skills which manifested themselves in revolutionary medical equipment and new cardiac surgery techniques.

Now, we can add 'Something the Lord Made' to that category of delights.  This stirring film captures the unlikely, real life partnership between Alfred Blalock (Rickman) and Vivien Thomas (Mos Def).  The two - and the movie's point is that it was The Two, not just Blalock - invented the entire discipline of cardiovascular surgery.  [In one of the film's sly and informed moments, Blalock addresses a student - 'Dr. Cooley.'  This would be Dr. Denton Cooley, a pioneer in the field himself, but depicted here as learning at the feet of Blalock...and Thomas.]

I love the moment at the end of film in which hung portraits of Blalock and Thomas (renderings of 'retired' Rickman and Mos Def done for the movie) give way to the real-life portraits of the two men which hang in the halls of Johns Hopkins.  It's then you realize that this is one movie where the events weren't overplayed.  This is a true tale of triumph and friendship.

This is twofold:  First, the film has the uncanny ability to make us stop whatever we're doing, when we come across it on cable, to watch; and second, the ability to absorb us totally and completely into the story.  Such is the case with director Joseph Sargent's SOMETHING THE LORD MADE.

Based on true events, this is the story of Dr. Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, two pioneers in the field of cardiac surgery.  Dr. Blalock is obnoxious and high on ego; yet he also has dedicated his career to saving lives--in particular, ""blue babies"", the tiny infants with heart abnormalities preventing the flow of oxygen, thus usually leading to their deaths.  Blalock hires Thomas, a quiet and unassuming African-American man, as a janitor in his lab at Vanderbilt, yet it soon becomes apparent to the surgeon that Thomas is a medical genius; soon Vivien is promoted to lab technician (although still receiving a janitor's pay), where he becomes indispensable to Blalock's ongoing research into open heart surgery--a very risky proposition in the 1940s.  Once the surgery is successfully performed at Johns Hopkins University it is Dr. Blalock who receives all the credit and accolades, while Thomas, a perpetual victim of Jim Crow, is ignored or shunned.  Even Blalock himself refuses to publicly acknowledge Thomas, leading to a tension that temporarily ends their association.  Yet in the end, many years later, Thomas receives his overdue recognition at Johns Hopkins, in one of the most moving scenes you'll ever experience.

Quite frankly, for the most part, I find Alan Rickman annoying; yet as Dr. Blalock he is absolutely convincing and believable as the gruff, no-nonsense surgeon.  And Mos Def is a most effective counterpart as the quiet, patient Thomas--a man yearning for one of humanity's most vital emotional needs:  recognition.  Meanwhile, director Sargent vividly recreates the sights and sounds of medical experiments and primitive surgery, which again immerses the viewer into the story.  SOMETHING THE LORD MADE is an extraordinary, remarkable film, most highly and enthusiastically recommended.

2172942,5,B00067BCBI,This movie was heartfelt and heartwarming.  I couldn't stop watching it.  It was quite touching.,1231632000,,96,5.333333333333333
2172943,5,B00067BCBI,"My interpretation of the title, Something the Lord Made, refers not just to the genuis of the black assistant's (Vivien Thomas played by Mos Def) ""feel"" for surgery but also to his incredible restraint at the lack of recognition shown by lead surgeon, Dr. Blalock (Alan Rickman).  Clearly, the latter's surgical achievements would have been delayed at best if not for the former's unique abilities.

Of particular interest is the response of Blalock to Thomas within the racial/social context of the time (1944).  In the film, Blalock excludes Thomas from any social recognition.  This occurs most notably following the successful ""blue baby"" reversal procedure.  During the subsequent press conference, Thomas isn't included.  Could this have been an innocent omission by Blalock or was Thomas intentionally excluded?  The film doesn't provide a definite answer to this important question delving into the character of Dr. Blalock.  My opinion:  Blalock deliberately excludes Thomas from recognition because he was frightened of having to share his success with a second-class citizen of the time.  To admit that a black man orchestrated the preliminary canine-research leading to open-heart surgery was too much for Blalock and the majority of whites in 1944 to swallow.  Fortunately, Thomas receives his long-overdue honorary doctorate at the end of the film.",1230854400,2,1362,5.438095238095238

2172982,5,B00067BCBI,"This 2004 made for television film details the lives of Drs Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) and Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman), who are pioneers in the field of cardiac surgery.

Prior to the 1940's, it was theorized that touching the human heart would result in instant death. These two doctors' work in conjunction with Dr. Helen Taussig in as well as emergency surgeries begun in World War II gave rise to the discipline of cardiology.

Vivien Thomas began working for Dr. Alfred Blalock in 1929 at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, TN.  At the time, Blalock was studying trauma. Blalock and Thomas together developed the procedure to transfuse blood to restore life to trauma patients.

That work took the pair of them to Johns Hopkins where the Dr. Blalock was challenged by Dr. Taussig to help 'blue babies.' The two pioneered both the instruments and techniques including sutures that 'grow' that enabled blue babies to live.

It's no surprise this film won an Emmy in 2004.  ""Something the Lord Made"" is a fascinating historical depiction of a pioneering time in our history both scientifically and racially.

The procedure they developed was for babies with congenital heart defects (CHD), but it ushered in an era of heart surgery that ended up pioneering treatment surgeries for - CHD's now more well-know cousin - acquired heart disease.

Alan Rickman did a surprisingly good job playing a good guy (something I don't think I've seen too often...he should do it more) and Mos Def gave an equally good performance.  I don't like to give spoilers, but if you have issues with animal experimentation this movie isn't for you.  If you understand the medical necessity in it, and take it as that, then this is a great movie about the beginning of open heart surgery for the treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot and how racial prejudice could have easily delayed or even prevented this procedure.

My only criticism is the use of foul language during one of characters temper tantrums.  I don't think it was necessary and it almost seemed out of character for Dr. Blalock, at least the way Mr. Rickman portrayed the character...it seemed almost ""forced"".  It could have been a great family movie with the deletion of the obscenities as this could be a springboard for the discussion of racial issues, animal experimentation and even critically ill children.

Thomas takes home textbooks at night and teaches himself medicine. He is also very skilled with his hands and wants to pursue a career as a surgeon but America is not a friendly environment for blacks who want to achieve in the scholastic world, especially the world of medicine. It soon becomes apparent to Blalock what a genius Thomas is and what a skilled surgeon he could make. While Thomas perfects a new technique that saves thousands of infant lives (still in use today I understand), Blalock gets all the credit. The acting is outstanding and the story will bring tears to your eyes. It's still hard to believe this was America 50 to 60 years ago. A great movie. Too bad it never made it to the theaters.

2173047,5,B00067BCBI,"When I read the description of Something The Lord Made, I thought to myself - there is just no conceivable way that this is going to be interesting.  However, it did have a lot going for it.  It was directed by Joseph Sargent, who also directed the brilliant, A Lesson Before Dying.  It starred Alan Rickman who is so good he could make an IKEA commercial look like it was directed by Ingmar Bergman.  It paired Rickman with Mos Def, who has remarkable screen presence.  (I first noticed Mos Def in another exceptional film, The Woodsman, which, coincidentally or not, also featured Kyra Sedgwick.)  So, despite the promise of (in)action confined exclusively to a medical lab, I forged ahead.

I'm so glad I did.  This is one of those minor gems you might easily miss.  Make sure to pay attention to the score, which is outstanding.  It's way too easy to sketch this movie out as an anti-racism diatribe, that's way too facile.  As with A Lesson Before Dying, racism is simply a fact, not a larger-than-life villain.  This, of course, makes the depiction that much more powerful.  We don't see the pain of racism courtesy of gassy soliloquies; we feel the pain of it as we read Mos Def's face watching Dr. Blalock receive his award at Baltimore's Biltmore Hotel.

Why beat a dead parrot?  We know the Biltmore is segregated.  Vivien - Def - can only gain admittance by posing as a bellhop.  We know that Blalock is a vain and arrogant surgeon (quelle surprise!) only too willing to bask in glory that would never have been his without Vivien's remarkable contributions.  And yes, we know that the racist culture surrounding these men makes it easy for Blalock to distance himself from Vivien when it suits him.

This context of racism is woven right into our flag; it's part of the culture, hardly newsworthy enough to merit a film.  The engine that's really driving Something The Lord Made is not racism at all; it's the subtle, complex relationship joining these very different men who share a passion for medicine.  The interplay between Vivien's self-effacing, quiet dignity and Blalock's braggadocio is pure gold, these two are so right for each other; they balance one another in a way that is touching at the very least.

Certainly there were moments when I wanted to explain to the supercilious twits at Hopkins that Vivien was the genius behind the wheel and they should be lavishing praise on him.  At times it was sad, and Vivien's stoicism makes it sadder.  But the movie never takes cheap shots; Def and Rickman offer marvelously reserved performances, thereby increasing the impact.  Ultimately I was left with an overwhelmingly positive sense of how people can, and often do, achieve miraculous things despite the mountains of debris and bizarre baggage they've been saddled with.

The story of the first heart surgery (also the first pediatric heart surgery, just to make the accomplishment even more difficult) is put into context.  I won't summarize the movie other than to say that issues of race, class, and gender were very important in this pioneering operation and led to the neglect of one of the key persons, Vivian Thomas, played with subtlety and skill by Mos Def.  Dr. Blalock, played by the consistently excellent Alan Rickman, is portrayed neither as a do-good crusader or a black-hatted parasite but with the ambiguity and mental conflicts inherent in such an intelligent and ambitious character.  A long-overdue recognition of Thomas' contributions ends the film and it would seem hackneyed were it not strongly based on true events.

2173091,5,B00067BCBI,"I want you to see this movie because it is a wonderfully acted story of people who actually lived not long ago and who did important things that still have an impact on the world we inhabit.  This movie is about the birth of cardiac surgery and how the great surgeon Dr. Alfred Blalock came to perform the first heart surgery on the blue baby, Eileen Saxon, in 1944.  It is also the story, and primarily the story of the great Vivien Thomas, an African-American, a surgical technician who was Dr. Blalock's assistant.

Thomas wanted to be a doctor, but his precarious finances were made impossible by the Great Depression.  He was grateful to be hired as a janitor by Blalock.  It wasn't long before Thomas' brilliance was appreciated by those who knew him, but the racist attitudes of those years prevented his great genius from being presented to and appreciated by the general public until much later.

Dr. Helen Taussig suggested a way to treat blue baby syndrome to Blalock who involved Thomas in researching the arterial shunt suggested by Taussig.  Thomas first developed the way to create the syndrome in dogs and then developed the way of relieving it with the shunt.  After a great deal of work with dogs, Thomas taught the procedure to Blalock and it was Blalock who did the first surgery in 1944.  Thomas could not perform the surgery because he wasn't a doctor and he did not get public acknowledgement for his contribution for decades.

Still, acknowledgement did come, and we are all better for knowing about this genius, the life Thomas led and the contributions he made.  Mos Def is brilliant as the quiet and dignified Thomas.  It is a subtle and moving performance.  Watch the details of the actor's characterization and how he adds so much depth to this portrayal of Thomas.

Alan Rickman is also fabulous as Dr. Blalock.  Here is a brilliant surgeon with the ego that cardiac surgeons have (need to have) in order to brave the challenge of taking their patients to the brink of death in order to give them life.  I enjoy the interactions between Blalock and Thomas.  Blalock is clearly a good man.  He braves much opposition to have Thomas in the surgical theater, but he is also a man of his time.  Blalock does not directly participate in the racial attitudes of his era, but he doesn't take his challenge of them beyond bringing Thomas in when he needs him.

This movie is full of wonderful moments that I never tire of seeing.  The other characters add to the richness of the movie, but it is the performances of Mos Def and Alan Rickman that make this movie the treasure it is.

Strongly and enthusiastically recommended.",1156377600,8,2647,4.67170626349892
2173092,5,B00067BCBI,"Wow! What a fantastic movie! I've seen this movie two times and would see it TWO HUNDRED times! The story was true to history and the acting was superb. I found myself letting out a tearful exclamation for Mr. Thomas' triumph as the movie regrettably came to an end. There are so many powerful lessons one can learn from this movie. Here are just a few (just my opinion):

- The degradating racism that black people had to face in years past is a shameful chapter in American history and should never be forgotten. But a more powerful lesson...

- Someone with a strong desire to succeed, the ability to learn, the ingenuity to side step road blocks, and the courage to put those traits into action cannot be stopped by ANYTHING! Faith can move mountains! And still another powerful lesson...

- The anger at the racism we may face--and we still face--must not blind us to those of a different color who present us with opportunities. Yes, sometimes it is with reluctance, but often their kindness is offered with a heart-felt desire to help one succeed.

I'm buying this movie and will show it to my nephews at my next opportunity. We must not forget the burdens our ancestors had to bear in order for us to benefit. And we must not forget our responsibility to continue that hard work for the next generation. We owe it to those who toiled in those rough fields!",1156032000,2,1364,4.532520325203252

Maybe I should see the movie again.  You gave the credit to Blalock and some other Caucasian Doctor  Only  ??

Racism and Prejudices are such complexities of the ""American Life""  Some of us live it every day and say ""What!... Not Me!  While others live and deal with it every day!  How obsurd to call the genius of Vivien Taylor ""loyal and dedicated""  This man had No formal medical training yet he went toe to toe with a Doctor who was at the top of his field.  Who was the real genius here  !",1155772800,,1094,4.36
2173094,5,B00067BCBI,"While other reviews focus on the content and plot of the film, I'd like to address the filmmaking aspects.

This film has taken its place on my top five list due to its outstanding script with its artful use of subtext; ensemble acting that is restrained in order to make its emotional currents all the more powerful; cogent, insightful, and sensitive direction; authentic set design; a score that enhances and complements the story's emotional tone; and circumspect, fearless editing.

Like the script for Brokeback Mountain, this one stays faithful to the story it is telling. It doesn't wander or digress but remains true to the message being conveyed. Therefore, the viewer doesn't get lost in unnecessary sub-plots. Each scene moves the story forward and reveals more about these characters--Blalock and Thomas--their relationship, and journey together. The story was told from Thomas' point of view as he wrestled with his conflicting needs for external acknowledgment and recognition vs. his internal need to follow his heart in the form of his ""true"" work.

While others discussed the racism conveyed by the film, I saw this as a backdrop that added complexity and obstacles to the personal journeys these men were on--much like the Holocaust provided the backdrop to Otto Schindler's evolution from a self-centered businessman to an enlightened human being. We all have obstacles to overcome--internal and external--given the genes we inherit, the families we are born into, and the time, place, and often oppressive social norms surrounding us. The ultimate question is how do we cope with the hand we are dealt? This story was first and foremost about Vivien Thomas' journey and his impact on and relationship with those around him as he fought his own internal battle to live authentically and honorably within a society of tightly restricted social and economic roles assigned by social class, ethnicity, and tradition.

This movie's dialog was some of the best I've ever heard. One of the most poignant moments comes when the two men are parting. Blalock stops abruptly and makes a short speech, saying that a person has never really lived unless they have regrets. He then says, ""I regret.."" which had he finished, would have been ""on the nose"" and far less evocative. Instead, he says simply, ""I have regrets."" In its brevity, this speech is all the more powerful for what Blalock doesn't say than what he does. We know exactly what he means and what he feels. And we know that Vivien does too. It is also in character with the Blalock we've come to know. This is dialog at its very best.

Not only is this dialog good but Rickman's delivery of this speech is next to perfect. We feel what Blalock is at that moment--the intensity of his regret and his feelings for Thomas. There is no emotional wall between actor and audience. Rickman invites us in in a very personal and intense moment.

Moments like this fill the film from both actors, and even the supporting cast. Dr. Taussig's (Mary Stuart Masterson's) unveling of Vivien's ""likeness"" puts us in the audience, feeling the joy she does in being able to acknowledge her colleague. Clara's (Gabrielle Union's) glance at the copy of Life magazine speaks volumes, as does the derision of Thomas and Blalock by Thomas' predecessor following their pioneering surgery.

Mos Def's portrayal of the mild-mannered, highly-intelligent, self-effacing, yet driven Thomas made learning of his other talents as a rapper all the more astonishing. What a range this man has! His performance was highly nuanced and intricately textured in rich contrast to Blalock's arrogant and eruptive character. The two actors blended and twisted their personalities together like a windy country road which served to demonstrate how human relationships based on common values and commitments bloom into respect to the point of genuine love--that of cherished friends. And look what that level of relationship was able to achieve! Was there doubt in anyone's mind that Thomas actually came to love Blalock when his footing became unsure after hearing of his colleague's fate or when he thanked his friends who ""could not be here"" when he finally received his long overdue acknowledgment? The performance of each actor served to enhance the power of the other. What an example of ensemble acting!

When acting is this uniformly good, as it was in Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People,"" you can bet it's the result of first-rate directing. Shots are varied and supportive of the story and the director appears to genuinely care about the people whose stories he is telling and treats them with much respect. This voice of respect shone through as a narrator far away in the distance but ever-present. Perhaps that's one of the signs of good directing--truly caring about your characters and the story you're telling. Audiences sense that when it's there.

As a boomer around for much of the time during which the story took place and having been in Hopkins and grown up in the DC-Baltimore area, I found the sets and mood established for the place and times to be very authentic. Great job by the set design folks.

It is difficult to focus on the lighting because the story is so involving, but the emotional content is frequently enhanced not only by the melodious and also understated score, but by some incredible lighting. If you permit yourself the pleasure of watching this film multiple times, look for it. You'll be rewarded if you do.

Editing was tight--almost too tight. I found myself wondering, for example, how and where Vivien got into his bellboy suit and how he could afford to throw it away. The editor discarded any footage that did not contribute directly to the story--thereby, helping to tell it and only it.

It's rather astonishing that so much artistic merit could dwell in the heart of such a ""small"" story not well-known outside of medicine and probably not even outside of cardiology or Hopkins. The fact that it was produced by HBO and not a big-name studio with a big budget, makes its achievements all the more laudable.

If you're a movie buff or purist, be sure to latch onto this one. It can be enjoyed many times over!",1155254400,7,6191,4.952793834296725
2173095,5,B00067BCBI,"I know my review rating (5*'s) seems like a mistake.  Well, as an African-American male, I appreciate quality knowledge of the past.

2173096,4,B00067BCBI,"The extraordinary story of Vivien Thomas is one that all Americans should be proud of. Thomas proved what was formerly a common tenent in this country--that you do not need a formal education or a degree from a prestigious university in order to excel and achieve miraculous things.

Thomas's story is also one we should be ashamed of. In striving for his dreams he overcame obstacles and suffered indignities that were degrading--not to Thomas, but to the ignorant and short-sighted men who feared his abilities and his success.

""Something the Lord Made"" does a beautiful job of telling this story without getting lost in an obsessive need to create villains and saints. All of the characters are richly human, complex and sometimes contradictory. We see that ego, even more than racism, prevents Blalock from giving Thomas the credit he deserves. Bureaucracy, a near-universal hindrance, places another stumbling block in his path (though, without racism, this might have been more easily surmounted).

The result is an inspiring movie that evokes both triumph and  disappointment. It does not tell you to hate racism--it makes you feel the tragedy of racism. It reminds us that even good men can be betrayed by their own weaknesses, and that forgiveness is a blessing on both the giver and the receiver.

Alan Rickman and Mos Def are simply great together. They are able to recreate with subtleness the complex relationship between two men who were equal, yet unequal; who were forced acknowledge their need for each other, in spite of their strong, independent spirits.

2173098,5,B00067BCBI,"In this movie, an uneducated, but bright, black man works with a leading doctor to develop the techniques and instruments needed to perform the world's first heart surgery.  Before Blalock and Thomas, the rule for medicine was that doctors do not touch the heart.  Although the development of the procedure is exciting, the real lesson in this movie is that even if one does not have the means or social standing to accomplish something great, with perseverance and a keen mind one can work around those restrictions to do great things.  Before the end of his life, 'carpenter' Thomas was a professor at Johns Hopkins medical school, teaching future doctors heart surgery techniques, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate.

If parents are unable to give their hopeful, bright sons or daughters the education they need to succeed, they can show them this movie and encourage them to work for their goals by any means they can find.

I feel they very accurately protrayed two of the greatest medical pioneers in the twentieth century, Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas. My favorite scene is during the surgery where the little Tet girl all of a sudden turns from the nasty blue to a normal pink.

2173120,5,B00067BCBI,"This movie is a gem:  It intertwines multiple stories together and does so brilliantly.

At one level, it can be viewed as how the evolving relationship between two extraordinary people led to great medical advances.  There is the brilliant, brash short-tempered white surgeon Blalock and the equally brilliant, cool, calm, dignified Black janitor/student/technician/assistant/...(I won't give it away- watch the movie) Thomas.  These two opposing personalities recognize that they complement each other perfectly, and, develop a deep respect for each other. Working together they make extraordinary advances in medicine from discovering the nature and treatment for shock to performing the first heart surgery.

On another level, the movie presents the realities of race relations in American History.  While Thomas and Blalock work as equals in the laboratory, on the outside world, things couldn't be more different.  While Blalock lives in a mansion, and gets lauded for 'his' advances at galas, the press and by the medical community, Thomas works extra jobs to pay rent, including serving as a waiter at Blalock's parties!  Its heartbreaking to see his contributions so thoroughly ignored by the outside world- he is not even included in the picture taken of first medical team to perform the surgery, is not included as an co-author in medical journal articles, and he is not invited to, much less acknowledged at, conferences and gatherings.  However, the advent of civil rights brings Thomas gradually increasing recognition, leading to the film's rich and incredibly gratifying ending.

The film is often at is best when it shows the outside world of racism colliding with the collegial world of laboratory:  when Thomas, working as a waiter in Blalock's party, shocks the other physicians with his knowledge and insight during a discussion of possible surgery for the heart condition tetralogy of fallot, or when Blalock visits the Thomas family and gets an icy cold reception from Thomas' wife Clara for finally arranging for a raise for Thomas from a `maintenance worker' to a 'lab technician,' to the highlight of the movie where Blalock finds he just cannot perform his first heart surgery without Thomas at his side, regardless of the general surprise and snickering/denigration of some of his colleagues.

Last but not least, this is also a movie about one of the extraordinary advances of medical science.  It is brilliantly done just from a medical history point of view.  Medical concepts are explained simply but without sacrificing accuracy.  Watching how Thomas and Blalock go from stage to stage- from creating a cardiovascular condition similar to tetralogy of fallot in a dog, to performing the first corrective procedures in dogs (with some tragic mishaps) to performing the first successful procedure in a baby girl is simply fascinating.  Indeed, watching baby Eileen's face turn from blue to pink upon success of the surgery- one feels that one has just witnessed a modern miracle.

Indeed, it is something the Lord made possible, working through the minds and hands of two extraordinary men from two very different worlds.",1150070400,2,3153,5.286573146292585

2173123,5,B00067BCBI,"I can't say enough about this wonderful film.  I am outraged that the movie studios wanted nothing to do with this film.  So much the better for HBO I guess.  The story is about the doctors who pioneered the technics for heart surgery.  It was thought back then that you could not operate on the heart.  Dr. Blalock thought otherwise.  Vivien Thomas was a carpenters son and was very skilled at his trade.  After losing his job he finds a job cleaning the lab for Dr. Blalock who was working on shock syndrome.  He used dogs for his research.  Blalock soon discovered that Thomas had skills beyond that of a carpenter.

It is said that Alan Rickman who played Dr. Blalock in the movie balked at saying the line ""this is like Something the Lord made.""  He thought is was corny having to say the title of the movie as dialogue.  I beg to differ.  When you think of the line within the context of Vivien Thomas, a truer word was never spoken.  Indeed, Thomas was something the Lord made.  God made Vivien Thomas a doctor even though he never went to medical school.  You've seen that happen before.  A pianist who can't read music, a painter who never took art lessons, a preacher who never went to seminary school, etc.

Mos Def (he should buy himself a new name now) plays Thomas and he is brilliant in this role.  I don't know if he'll ever do anything as wonderful as this again.  He is a natural.  Seems that the Lord made him an actor:)  Def has great instincts and great timing.  I was highly impressed.  If you watch the film closely, you will notice that he changes his body language and voice 3 times as the character ages.  Mos Def seems to play a spot on image of Thomas who played things close to the vest and was not prone to outbursts or fits of temper even when he became angry.

You must view this film.  It's heart breaking to watch Blalock and the other doctors get their picture taken for a magazine while Thomas stands in the background with no recognition at all even though Blalock called him into the O.R. to talk him through the procedure.

I won't tell you what happens at the end but you'll be happy with the end results.  Please, please, please don't miss this one. I must commend HBO.  It seems as though they are the only company that produces african american themed films on a regular basis.

2173125,4,B00067BCBI,"""Something the Lord Made"" was written by Peter Silverman and Robert Caswell and directed by Joseph Sargent.  It is an inspiring film that was based in part on a magazine article by Katie McCabe who derived her material from a true story.  The movie stars the great British actor, Alan Rickman, who adopts a southern accent for his role as an ambitious and imperious surgeon and medical researcher named Dr. Alfred Blalock.  Blalock hires a black man, Vivien Thomas, underplayed beautifully by Mos Def, to do odd jobs around his lab.  Much to Dr. Blalock's shock, Vivien is not only incredibly skilled with his hands, but he picks up medical knowledge like a sponge and would like to become a doctor himself.  Soon Vivien becomes an indispensible assistant to Blalock, who learns to respect the young man's dedication, intuition, and creativity.

The story begins in the thirties, when opportunities for bright young African-Americans were few, and Thomas is thrilled to be involved in important and involving work.  However, as the years pass, he begins to resent the fact that he is perpetually relegated to the status of a second class citizen and he finds it impossible to support a wife and children on the low wages that he receives.

Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blalock as an arrogant, self-centered, and short-tempered individual who is anxious to be a pioneer in medical research.  He gets the chance to do just that when he and Vivien come up with a plan to perform heart surgery, an unprecendented operation that most doctors considered impossible. Mos Def imbues Thomas with quiet intelligence and dignity, and he is genuinely touching as a man whose wounded pride gets in the way of his willingness to perform the job he loves.

The film's main weakness lies in its unsubtle treatment of institutional racism and reactionary hospital administrators. Kyra Sedgwick plays the stock role of Dr. Blalock's wife, Mary, a beautiful and long-suffering spouse who rarely sees her busy husband.  Gabrielle Union is the sugary sweet Clara Thomas, Vivien Thomas's supportive and patient wife. Mary Stuart Masterson is the hearing-impaired Dr. Helen Taussig, a caring and tenacious physician who first gives Blalock the idea of operating on ""blue babies.""

In spite of its few flaws, ""Something the Lord Made"" is worth seeing for its unfliching look at an unusual collaboration between two very different men who shared a passion for saving lives.  It is also a history lesson about the days when heart surgery was unthinkable and when talented men of color were relegated to a secondary and unheralded role in medicine.",1141430400,8,2615,5.011547344110855

DC steadily keeps working, aptly executing myriad roles in many movies, kinda like Samuel Jackson, although I think it took SJ much longer to get starring roles -- more years in the business, I mean.

There's no fluff nor wasted time in this story.  Everything advances the storyline.  Rarely does Hollywood manage to tell someone's true life story without making this viewer feel they've taken too much creative license.

This is precisely the kind of story Hollywood SHOULD be telling, but very rarely does.  There are so many such real-and-better-than-fiction stories available, but moviegoers keep settling for the same-old same-old.

This movie takes you through a series of emotions as you watch it. Vivien Thomas is only one of many African Americans who never received the proper recognition they deserved because of the times they lived in. It seems only right for America to right all the wrong done to African Americans like Dr. Vivien Thomas and honor them for their accomplishments and contributions to society. Some of the simple pleasures we enjoy today are possible because of the knowledge, inventions and hard work of citizens like Dr. Thomas. The color of our skin does not define the person or make them inferior. This has been proved over and over and Dr. Viven Thomas is the perfect example.

2173140,5,B00067BCBI,"This is a quality HBO production about two extraordinary men who developed a new technique in heart surgery, (In fact heart surgery had never been done before) creating by-passes to the heart, in this case, the condition of `blue babies', where not enough blood or oxygen reaches the heart of the child, thus causing the skin to turn blue. This was a fatal condition before this surgical technique was developed. One can imagine that it is difficult enough operating on a full grown, adult heart, but the first by-pass surgery was done on an infant, which makes the event that much more incredible.

Alan Rickman plays the famous Dr. Alfred Blalock, whose approach to medicine generally extended beyond the received wisdom, forging ahead in to new areas and known for taking risks in the development of modern surgical medicine.

Mos Def put in an incredible performance as the famous African American, Vivien Thomas, once a skilled carpenter, to then discover his natural gift for surgery and medicine in general.

Since this groundbreaking surgery was performed, literally thousands of lives have been saved across the planet, thanks to the skill and determination of an educated and gifted researcher and a special autodidact, a man naturally skilled in surgery and a deep passion for the profession.

The film depicts the entrenched and generally accepted racism and social segregation at the time, shown with Vivien Thomas's constant battle against unfounded prejudice while working with Dr. Blalock at John Hopkins. However despite this racism, Thomas became an invaluable teacher at John Hopkins and finally, after the death of Dr. Blalock, was given the accolades, an honorary doctorate, and included as one of the great teachers and surgeons at the world famous hospital.

Is there humility in utter greatness? Well, to say the least, Vivien Thomas was terribly humble and extremely intelligent and, as the film implies, was the central contributor to the development of bypass surgery. What an inspiring individual.

HBO has a reputation for creating top quality films. Something the Lord Made is certainly one of them. Outstanding performances from the entire cast, a well written script, sound track and a story that should be more well known.

2173165,5,B00067BCBI,"I love this movie for two reasons. The first because, I myself had a right sided Blalock-Taussig shunt operation performed on me back in July of 1972, when I was about 16 months old. This allowed me the strength and oxygen needed to stick around until Nov. of 1976, when a complete repair of my tetralogy of Fallot complex was carried out.

Seeing the history and background of this operation hit me, as you may imagine, on a very personal and emotional level. It's also a little humbling to know that, basically, ALL open-heart surgery performed today, saving so many lives, is related to the surgery designed fix the condition; I came into this world with. Thereby, breaking the convention of not messing with the heart.

Thing is, I had thought this movie had a great impact on my emotions, which it did. But, that was nothing compared to watching this movie with my mother. Whenever the focus was on blue babies in particular, she about fell apart. While she was interested in the truths and history portrayed in this film, she was unable to complete watching the film. The names, the symptoms and the babies, just rang to true and real for her to handle.

So, I guess I would caution parents of a child that has had to go through this that, you may want to think twice about watching this movie. I would however, recommend that if said child is old enough to understand, you should buy them a copy of this movie. I think I will help them understand what a wonderful gift they have been given.

The second reason is because, of the historical value of this film. They way people treated each other then was just so... While better today, I still think there is a ways to go. I think watching this, can show the current generations were we have come from, and hopefully, help them understand there is still a ways to go. A little ambitious maybe, but then again, I should not be around today, to be typing these words either.

Finally, I would like to thank Mos Def and Alan Rickman for there stunning performances in this film. Awesome, just awesome.",1119830400,69,2054,4.525606469002695
2173166,5,B00067BCBI,"Vivien Thomas would have been on his way to medical school if not for the stock market crash of 1929 wiping out the Thomas' finances.  A skilled carpenter trained by his father, Vivien took work in the research lab of surgeon Alfred Blalock.

The partnership was magic.  Blalock had been a disappointment of sorts.  Although he graduated from Johns Hopkins, he didn't get his desired residency in surgery there, and after three years he left Baltimore to become the first surgery resident at Vanderbilt in Nashville.

Blalock had ideas about treatment of shock due to trauma - the now common sense plan of blood transfusion - and his research led to the saving of untold lives in World War II (and beyond). As a result of his new fame he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at Johns Hopkins.  He brought along Vivien Thomas.

The achievements of Dr. Blalock are suitably shown in this movie, but the film wisely focuses on Thomas and on their relationship.  Without a single day as a medical student, Thomas uses his innate intelligence and abilities so well that he becomes the lab extension of Blalock's research.  While Blalock is off being Chief of Surgery, Thomas is in the lab, devising new surgical techniques on dogs.  The movie by-passes the technique Blalock and Thomas devised for treatment of coarctation of the aorta.

Dr. Helen Taussig is a pediatric cardiologist at Hopkins who cares for those unfortunate children born with ""blue baby syndrome"" - Tetrology of Fallot - with a severely narrowed pulmonary artery (carrying blood to the lungs from the heart) and a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart (allowing already poorly oxygenated blood to bypass the body).  She approaches Blalock and the Blalock-Thomas team go to work trying to reproduce the condition in the laboratory so that they can devise a means to treat it.  (Historical records show that it could have been any one of the three who came up with the idea).

So while Vivien Thomas is doing the bulk of the lab work that will eventually bring Dr. Blalock world-wide fame, he is being paid as a ""class 3"" employee (the pay scale for custodial workers) at Hopkins because he is black.  He isn't even allowed to enter his building through the front door.

The film doesn't gloss over the fact that racism holds Thomas in his place when his own intelligence and abilities have made him in every way Blalock's colleague.  It also doesn't gloss over the fact that Blalock did little to correct things for his colleague.

Alan Rickman portrays Blalock and Mos Def gives an astonishing performance as Thomas.  Real suspense is generated in the scenes surrounding the first ""blue baby"" operation.  Heart surgery had never been performed before, and failure would be both a professional setback, but also mean death for the child.

Seeing the final scenes, where Vivien Thomas finally gets some of his due credit for his extraordinary work (20 years after Blalock and Taussig have their fame), is a heart-warming thing.  The world is a richer place for the contributions of these Doctors.",1119744000,24,3097,4.825757575757576
2173167,5,B00067BCBI,"Watching the progress of many of the films bravely created for television viewing by HBO move into the DVD market is gratifying.  Such a decision rubber stamps the importance of these 'small films' and makes them available to the general public.

Such is certainly the case for SOMETHING THE LORD MADE which is a tender epistle about the growth of trust and bonding between two men for the good of science and mankind.  Dr. Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) is a cardiovascular surgeon whose importance in the field of medicine is still being recognized.  An early pioneer in the hemodynamics of vascular and cardiac surgery, this brief portion of his life focuses on his benevolence in hiring a bright but impoverished young African American Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) and through a recognition of the latter's fine mind and bright spirit, bonds in a way that for the day was completely dissonant to the rest of racially prejudiced America.

How these two men finessed the surgery for a congenital disorder of the great vessels of the heart which had always meant death to those born with this Tetralogy of Fallot before Blalock and Thomas intervened is but one aspect of this sensitive film.  The even more important statement is the one of racial equality that preceded many other more famous movements.  Much of the power of this film is in the portrayals of Mos Def and Alan Rickman who are both brilliant in their interpretations.  This is a subtle film and one that is greatly enhanced by a superb supporting cast and the capable direction by Joseph Sargent.  Simply stated, this is one of those films that everyone should see.

It takes place in the 1930's, a society in which only doctors can be paged and blacks are only qualified to get donuts.  Alan Rickman and Mos Def play the men who got rid of the myth that heart surgery is impossible.  Rickman does a great job here as an egotistical southerner who does mean the best. He is probably underrated as an actor.  However, I have yet to buy the Mos Def bill of goods. Here and in ""The Woodsman"" he comes off as perpetually stoned, which eliminates any opportunity for his characters to come alive.  The main problem with this film is that it comes off as a standard biopic that failed to captivate me.  It even gives in to biopic clichs like the nagging wife (in fact this one even has 2 of them).  These movies (""Ray"" and ""Miracle"" also spring to mind) would have you believe that females do much more to hinder progress than they do to inspire it.  And speaking of hindering progress the Church makes an appearance opposing heart surgery.  It makes you wonder if the Church has even been in favor of anything other than pain.  It also glosses over the fact that the research here was perfected on dogs, yet doesn't even pose the question of whether or not this is ethical.  I would say that it's probably not.  If we're all living things why are some allowed to be science experiments? When the Nazis did it to men we all screamed bloody murder, yet when we do it to man's best friend (in the same decade) we call it science.  In the end the black man is supposedly repaid for all the suffering the hospital put him through, but again I questioned whether or not this was fair payment.  More than anything this movie reminded me that college is a system that you pay into as opposed to some place where educational miracles are born.

The movie portrays all of this superbly. Welll worth watching several times.",1110844800,6,435,5.78125
2173195,3,B00067BCBI,"In the 1940s, Dr. Alfred Blalock and a team of doctors at Johns Hopkins were making great advances and innovations in the field of cardiac surgery. However, with the great multitude of privileged doctors surrounding him, perhaps Blalock's most valuable asset was the work of his lab assistant, Vivien Thomas, a black man who was never given the chance to be a doctor, but was given, by Blalock, the opportunity to help develop revolutionary techniques that would save countless lives.

Something the Lord Made, a film made for HBO, tells this story from Vivien's perspective, which is radically different from the story that was told at the time by the international media. Mos Def plays Vivien, and does a wonderful job in making Vivien a real person, instead of an idealistic caricature, who doesn't make much money, but isn't satisfied making more money elsewhere, because he really enjoys the field of medicine. Alan Rickman plays Dr. Blalock and adds an atrocious southern accent to an otherwise stable performance.

Vivien Thomas, a carpenter by trade, has been saving for medical school for several years, when he comes across the opportunity to be a janitor in the lab of Dr. Alfred Blalock, a young research doctor who experiments on dogs in order to find a way to perform surgery to repair defective hearts, an operation that has been deemed impossible by most experts. Vivien shows some interest and more than a little knowledge of medicine, and soon Blalock has given him a white coat and they work side by side in the lab, challenging one another along the way. When Blalock gets a new job as head of surgery at Johns Hopkins, he insists that Vivien come along with him.

The doctors at Hopkins are very slow to accept Vivien, a black man, into their world, but he slowly gains their respect through his extensive knowledge and calm demeanor. There are still skeptics, however, and Vivien wonders whether Blalock is treating him as an equal or just using him to further his own career and accomplishments. After they perform the first surgery together, Vivien isn't even allowed to be in the pictures taken for the magazines.

This is a good made-for-TV movie, but not up to the standards of a theatrical release. The dialogue is all medically accurate, I am told, but when they are not talking medicine, the characters aren't given much interesting to say. As I stated before, the performances are solid, with Mos Def shining most brightly, but Alan Rickman really needs to stick to British characters, because more often than not, his accent was just distracting. But overall, this was an interesting film, and I was able to take away from it some medical information and history, so I'll give it one thumb up.",1110758400,12,2725,4.8412017167381975
2173196,5,B00067BCBI,"For me the worst bigots are not the ones who carry shotguns and engage in lynchings.  Underneath their hatred is a fear born from knowing in the marrow of their bones that they are not as good as the people they are oppressing and that on an equal playing field they will be the ones who end up on the bottom.  I am always outraged more by those bigots whose racism is embodied in what they say and how they say it, as well as by the gestures they demand to keep Jim Crow in place despite the evidence of their eyes and the assumption what they see actually gets into their brains.  In ""Something the Lord Made,"" there is a moment where a white doctor at the most prestigious hospital in the country makes a point of leaving his office and go into a laboratory just to have a black man fetch food and drink.  I look at such a man and wonder what he is thinking, knowing that whatever it is, it is just not right.

Racism is the subtext of ""Something the Lord Made,"" an HBO movie that dramatizes the story first told in the ""American Experience"" documentary ""Partners of the Heart.""  This is the story of Dr. Alfred Blalock, who pioneered cardiac surgery in 1944 when he and Dr. Helen Taussig developed the Blalock-Taussig technique, a surgical procedure that repaired the faulty blood vessel in the hearts of babies that was causing a lack of oxygen.  This fatal birth defect turned babies a light shade of blue, resulting in their being commonly called ""blue babies"" (Fallot's tetralogy).  The story of ""Something the Lord Made"" is about not only this pioneering medical work, but also the relationship between Blalock and Vivien Thomas, a lab technician. Blalock (Alan Rickman) is white and Thomas is black (Mos Def), which is why racism keeps rearing its head throughout the tale.

Blalock is a brilliant but brash physician doing pioneering work on the treatment of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock (Blalock demonstrated that surgical shock resulted primarily from the loss of blood, and therefore encouraged the use of plasma or whole-blood transfusions as treatment).  Thomas has been saving his money to go to medical school but has been working as a carpenter's assistant when he gets a job sweeping and cleaning Blalock's laboratory and dog kennels (experimental techniques are developed working on dogs, once a condition comparable to what is found in humans is created).  But the doctor quickly discovers that Thomas has a quick and inventive mind and the Great Depression ends Thomas' dream of going to medical school.  What starts off as a relationship between master and servant (or at least boss and employee), becomes that of teacher and student.  By the time Blalock moves to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and takes Thomas with him, the two have become joined at the brain.  There is a delightful scene where Blalock is kicking around ideas with his new colleagues and Thomas keeps making comments and bouncing ideas off the doctor until they are involved in an intense discussion and everybody is watching dumbfounded.

Director Joseph Sargent (""Colossus: The Forbin Project,"" ""Miss Evers' Boys"") has two major stories to tell here.  One is the medical story of the invention of cardiac surgery and the other is the human story of whether Vivien Thomas would ever be recognized for his invaluable assistance in that effort.  Thomas does the work of a lab technician, but is paid as a janitor.  He has to use the back entrance at Johns Hopkins when he comes to work and students flock to see the great Dr. Blalock assisting Thomas when operating on a dog.  Even after they achieve their greatest success, there are colleagues who laugh at Blalock because he needed Thomas' help to do the impossible, their bigotry making it impossible for them to realize doing the impossible is no mean feat.

There are social victories along the way.  Not so much that Blalock is finally persuaded to do something about his invaluable assistant's salary as the young doctors who come up to Thomas and ask if they can work with him in their spare time (although their accents are invariably not of the south).  But Blalock is getting his picture on the cover of ""Life"" and the only one in the operating theater not in the group photographs are Thomas and the nurse, and there is an element of sadness that it was over a decade after Blalock died that Thomas received his overdue recognition.  Was Blalock's problem that he was egotistical or that the man was so focused?  The film suggests it was the latter and that the work was what mattered.  Indeed, the most memorable scene in this 2004 film is when we see with our own eyes the miracle that Blalock, Thomas, Taussig, and these others wrought in 1944.

""Something the Lord Made"" won the 2004 Emmy for outstanding made-for-TV movie, due in part to the marvelously understated performances by Rickman and Def.  The DVD includes audio commentary by Sargent, writer Peter Silverman, and producers Robert W. Cort and Eric Hetzel.  The featurette on the making of the film and historical slide show both get into some of the true story, which is worth pursuing on its own.  The frail child on whom the operation was first performed died months later during a second operation.  But the film does make it clear that she was very ill and a high-risk patient to begin with, who was doomed to die, and what happened at Johns Hopkins in 1944 did prove the surgical procedure worked well enough to end up saving the lives of tens of thousands of children.  So there are more aspects of this fascinating story that have been left untold that you can certainly find out more about.",1109980800,174,5619,4.72057318321392

2173198,5,B00067BCBI,"Something the Lord Made: This movie was unbelievable. It is based on a true story about a rich white doctor and a poor black carpenter. Those in the medical field will most likely know both of these names. The rich white doctor was Dr. Alfred Blalock and the poor black carpenter was Vivien T. Thomas. What made this movie so terrific to watch is it kept you interested and it moved quickly. It was really quite true to the period of time it was set in (About the 1940's)......It covers a 40 year span though and does it effortsly.

MARY STUART MASTERSON plays Dr. Helen Taussig, an intregal part of this story.

SOMETHING THE LORD MADE is a moving story of men who defy the rules and start a medical revolution. Their patients are known as the ""blue babies"" - infants suffering from a congenital heart defect that turns them blue as they slowly suffocate.

Alfred Blalock (Alan Rickman) and Vivien Thomas (Mos Def) make a brilliant team. But even as they race against time to save one particular baby, the two occupy different places in society. Blalock is the white, wealthy head of surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Thomas is black and poor, a skilled carpenter whose dream of going to college and becoming a doctor was ruined by the Great Depression, although he was naturally gifted with the intuition and dexterity of a great surgeon.

Even as they save lives and invent a whole new field of medicine, social pressures threaten to tear them apart. Ultimately, however, Thomas finds his dreams coming true in unexpected ways.",1109548800,9,1531,4.701492537313433

I found this film to be wonderfully multifaceted. I watched and listened in awe as this beautifuly told story of Vivian Thomas, who I didn't know of, and the famous Drs. Blalock and Taussig evolves. It is compassionate in the treatment of African-Amrericans of the time and also the egoistic white surgeons and doctor surrounding the ground breaking reseach on heart surgery. Further research by me indicates that the story is as close to historically correct while still maintaining a bit of the drama. Purhaps I was more deeply impacted by the story of Mr Thomas, knowning all too well the status of the ancillary indviduals who surround these famous people. He was a powerful figure, but to a point was only interested in his research and allowed the Doctors to gleen the accolades.

2173205,5,B00067BCBI,"Alan Rickman and Mos Def give superb performances in this wonderfully-written film about the triumph of intelligence and creativity over the effects of racial prejudice.

""Something The Lord Made"" is the real-life story of Dr. Alfred Blalock and technician (later Dr.) Vivian Thomas, both of whom pioneered open-heart surgery in America in the mid-twentieth century.

Rickman, as Blalock, gives a flawless, charismatic portrayal of an egotistical surgeon who gains nobility of spirit while he defies (and yet is simultaneously confined by) the customs of his society. Rickman's performance is all the more impressive because he is British, and Blalock was an American from the south; nevertheless, Rickman's southern accent is natural and effortless.

Rickman brings likability and humanity to what could otherwise be an unsympathetic character; and this core humanity gives ""Something The Lord Made"" a depth not often seen in tales of bigotry within American society. Too often, tales of this sort delineate the bad guys from the good guys in an almost cartoonish fashion, but Rickman's Blalock is both good and bad, reflecting more accurately the reality of the times in which both characters lived.

Mos Def gives a subtle, moving and sympathetic performance as Vivian Thomas, a gifted man who is caught in the trap of prejudice and the expectations of an unenlighted society. The film clearly demonstrates that Thomas is the intellectual peer of Blalock; it is society and circumstance that for years robs Thomas of the practical opportunity to become Blalock's actual peer in terms of status. Def gives us the portrait of a man who chooses patience over reaction; through him, we feel outrage at the denial of the respect due Thomas, time and again.

The writing in this film is low-key and highly effective.  Because American society has in some ways changed since the mid-twentieth century setting of this film, younger viewers may not understand the actions and choices made by Blalock and Thomas, both within this film and within real life. Nevertheless, ""Something The Lord Made"" gives an extremely uplifting and surprisingly accurate portrayal of life as it really existed in those times, and should be appreciated both as an historical and enlightening film.",1102377600,224,2270,5.2569060773480665

I wish there could be more output of this quality on TV, rather than garbage like ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven.""  Films do not require violence to be good (is anyone listening at the studios??)

  Alan Rickman transforms himself from a Brit to a Southerner without a hitch, and we are all the luckier for it.  This excellent actor manages to walk that fine line between the admiration for a black colleague's abilities and the accepted racism of the time.  Rickman's Alfred Blaylock is neither a villain nor a saint.  He is a brilliant doctor whose motives are focused solely on the benefit of the patient.  Mos Def also does an excellent job of portraying Vivian Thomas, a man with hopes and aspirations who, like Blaylock, is well aware of the restrictions of the era.  The two of them make the most of their working relationship in spite of the black/white issues in the 1930s-1960s.
