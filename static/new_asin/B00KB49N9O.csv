8657245,5,B00KB49N9O,"I was in the Navy 1961 to 1965. In 1961 I attended Radioman's School in Bainbridge, Maryland and on the base was a small
theatre. The cost of admission was ten cents and one evening I decided to go see this movie ""Claudelle Inglish"". Needless to
say I fell in love with Diane McBain and even went back the next evening to see the movie again. However, I can't really recall
the plot or storyline because I was so enamoured by her beauty the rest of the movie was superfluous. I've been looking for
this movie for twenty years and it's only now become available. Thank You Amazon.",1417737600,9,579,4.37037037037037
