4233536,3,B003ZDZ1XU,"If your job interview has the question, ""Do you suffer from any blood vessel abnormalities, iron deficiencies, vitamin B-12 deficiencies and/or intravenous drug usage?"" assume your boss is a vampire.

But in vampire movies, nobody ever figures out the bleeding obvious. And that's only the beginning for ""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Undead,"" a clever little indie movie that combines vampire horror, Arthurian legend, romance, and Shakespeare's classic play ""Hamlet."" It's sly and clever, but things start coming unravelled at the end.

Julian Marsh (Jake Hoffman) is unemployed, unhappily single and deeply depressed, so his dad forces him to take a directing job. The play: ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead,"" by Theo Horace (John Ventimiglia). Julian gets his buddy Vince (Kris Lemche) a job as Hamlet; his ex-girlfriend Anna (Devon Aoki), who is now involved with a sleazy mafioso, is also cast as Ophelia.

It's glaringly obvious that Theo and his cronies are all vampires, and Vince suspects that something is undead in the state of Denmark. Julian (still hopelessly clueless) is contacted by a secret organization (which apparently has only one schizophrenic member) who reveal the horrifying truth of Theo's diabolical plans! Can he extricate himself and Anna from the play before they join the legions of the undead?

Vampire legend, the Holy Grail, Shakespeare's play, and the disturbing underbelly of New York theatrical life. ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead"" is a fun little black comedy -- director/writer Jordan Galland was obviously having a lot of fun smushing these things together into one story.

The entire movie is filled with quirky, sly humor (Vince repelling vampires with garlic breath), fun running gags (professional hypochondriac Hugo Pepper), and the second half manages to insert a murder subplot where poor Julian is trying to escape the cops. And Galland manages to craft some fun, semi-realistic dialogue (""I don't think that's how a vampire would really [bite someone],"" Julian lectures Theo).

Probems? Julian is kind of stupid, since he doesn't figure out that Theo and Co. are vampires even though it's FRICKING OBVIOUS. Also the Holy Grail is central because it can cure vampirism, but then the subplot is just made pointless (and a chunk of the plot with it). Wha?

Even if the character is dumb and skanky, Hoffman is a pretty endearing actor -- he has that dorky, puppy-eyed charm that makes you cheer for him and hope that everything turns out all right. Aoki is rather wooden but okay, and Lemche is fun as Hoffman's overconfident gay buddy. As for Ventimiglia, he chews the scenery as the most cliched, obvious vampire you can imagine -- and obviously he's having a great time!

""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead"" is a fun little movie despite subplots that come unraveled at the end. Quirky, weird and splattered with blood!",1289952000,9,2895,5.197424892703863
8410168,3,B003ZDZ1XU,"It has been a while since I rented this movie, but I still remember it favorably, which says something positive about it.
This is pretty much what you might expect -- a vampire movie about a theatrical company that is always on the lookout for fresh blood.
An unexpected guest at the end adds some zest to the procedings.
OTOH, it has to get all cutsie-poo with another film with a very similar title. This may go over with the art-house-set, but I find this sort of thing distracting at best and annoying at worst.",1515024000,,515,4.431578947368421

An out of work director is hired for an adaption of Hamlet, unaware all the actors except the main character are vampires, and the actor portraying Horatio is the REAL Horatio, a vampire waiting to have a final showdown with the REAL Hamlet, who escaped the vampire curse by drinking from the Holy Grail. When the star ""dies"", the director has to step in and take his place...

...and thereby hangs a tale...

This  black comedy of vampires and Shakespeare is full of quotes from Hamlet as well as other clever bon mots. The acting is good, which is a surprise, since usually in an indie film, there are good actors as well as mediocre ones, but here?  While most names aren't known, except for Ralph Macchio and Jeremy Sisto, all are outstanding.

I'm surprised I haven't seen this film anywhere except on netflix, where I discovered it, and then on amazon, when I decided to buy it. This piece should've been released in theaters and been a hit.  After viewing it again and having to explain the title to a friend who's also a writer and should've been a bit aware, I'm wondering if perhaps all the literary references, which I found delightful, clever, and funny, would've off-put the average viewing audience a bit.

Whatever. It works for me. I loved it. and it's in my home library now where I can watch it as much as I like whenever I need a dark laugh as I consider my fairly useless diploma in English Lit and the Fine Arts. It also brings to mind the days I spent in college drama, to some extent.

Funny, Witty, Dark...I have a feeling Will Shakespeare (who is shown in a cameo, hastily transcribing Horatio's dictation) might've enjoyed it, too.

This film is silly and enjoyable. A little slow to start, but once the principal characters are introduced, it gets rolling and is quite enjoyable (much more so than more lavish and polished productions featuring any one of those single elements mentioned above.",1293753600,8,368,5.571428571428571
