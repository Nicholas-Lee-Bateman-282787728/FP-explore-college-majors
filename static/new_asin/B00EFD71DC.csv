LOCKDOWN 2013

This was the second PPV event of the year for TNA and was also in the wonderful city of San Antonio Texas. This was a good event that I think was better than the first one of the year but still not as great as what could have been. Of course the main event and ending was EXCELLENT and you know I loved it.

1.[3 WAY X TITLE MATCH]KENNY KING VS ZEMA ION VS CHRISTIAN YORK-great opening match that would see your typical high spots in an X match. That of course is not a bad thing because it is expected and to be honest the X Division has not been anywhere near what it used to be. So it was fun to see a match like this which had a great moment involving all three guys and the top rope. King keeps the belt here in a well earned victory, all three looked good here. I was not surprised that King and Ion did well here but I was happy to see York step his game up after he looked so sluggish at Genesis.

2. JOEY RYAN VS JOSEPH PARK-decent match right here with two guys I like. Park has been great especially with his facial expressions with this new lawyer character. Then of course we have Ryan who in my opinion has not been used properly. The match is pretty good and the crowd was with Park all the way here. He gets his first PPV win here after dropping down on Ryan for the pin.

Right here we have a backstage segment with Bully Ray, Brooke, and Hulk Hogan. I mention only because I really liked Hogan's speech here, it felt real.

3.[KNOCK OUT TITLE]VELVET SKY VS GAIL KIM-this was actually a better match than it gets credit for. Of course this match was more about building Kim's feud with a certain referee for this match. Still the match was good with Sky retaining her title

4. ROBBIE E VS ROBBIE T-I actually liked this match much more than I thought I would. Sure it is not a great match and it may be the worst on the card but I still enjoyed it for some reason. Of course it could have been seeing E get demolished in the end by T, T with the win as if you didn't know. This was your typical little/big guy team that split because of the little guys' arrogance. I liked this better when HBK and Nash did it in 94.

5.[TAG TITLE]AUSTIN ARIES & BOBBY ROODE VS BAD INFLUENCE VS CHAVO GUERRERO & HERNANDEZ-I really enjoyed this match right here as it was nonstop action. The crowd was really behind Chavo and Hernandez for obvious reasons. All three teams did an excellent job here as did the ref. I bring that up because he kept control for a good majority of the match. That is rare in these kinds of matches but of course things get a little out of the ref's hands towards the end. I am a fan of all these guys and knew they would deliver. Daniels and Kaz as well as Aries and Roode were excellent in their heel roles here. Chavo and Hernandez looked just as good, Hernandez in particular seemed like he picked his game up here. They really got the crowd going. I also like how Roode and Aries kept the belts, it was a good finish. I loved Chavo hitting everyone with those suplexes.

6.[CAGE MATCH]KURT ANGLE VS WES BRISCO-the first cage match of the night would pit Kurt Angle against Aces & Eights member Wes Brisco. Now I am a fan of this faction and have actually been enjoying the storyline. With that said I am a huge fan of Kurt Angle so I was a little torn here. But if it came down to it personally I wanted Kurt to win but story wise they needed to make A&E look strong. Now while Wes looked good here it was Kurt who really controlled the match. His German suplex off of the top was great and I liked the ending here. Kurt had nailed the ref and turned him inside out so he was out of it when Kurt made it out of the cage. This lead to D-Lo attacking him and putting him back inside the ring and pulling Wes out, of course the ref then turns to see Brisco outside of the cage. That is a win for A&E.

7.[LETHAL LOCKDOWN]TEAM TNA VS ACES & EIGHTS-my boy Mr. Anderson started things off for A&E doing battle with Magnus for the first three minutes. Most of this matchup would see Magnus in control but they were both down when Knux [Knox] made his way to the cage. Of course he and Anderson dominate Magnus until Samoa Joe is the next to enter. At this point the former tag champs work very well together with the tandem moves. Garett Bischoff was next up for A&E and he basically falls victim to the team of Joe and Magnus as well. A&E take control shortly before Eric Young makes his way to the cage and lights people up. Devon is next in the cage and helps put A&E back into control. James Storm hits the cage and tears into A&E even hitting the ""last call"" on Knux. Team TNA looks great at this point but then enters D.O.C. giving the numbers advantage back to A&E. but all things turn TNA's way once Sting hits the cage with his bat and lays everyone out. After that he distributes weapons to all his teammates. At this point A&E takes an insane beat down and TNA looks totally dominate. But things shift gears once the bad guys get their hands on the weapons. It looks like more of a natural thing when A&E are dominating with the weapons. Things get more intense of course and we even get a giant tower of doom, the crowd loved it. Not long after this Eric Young gets the win after coming off of the top of the cage with an elbow. This allows TNA to win the match and although I like everyone on their team I feel like A&E should have gotten the win to put the angle over more.

8.[STEEL CAGE TNA TITLE MATCH]JEFF HARDY VS BULLY RAY-with the history these two have had I knew that this was going to be a good match. This match was all about the speed of Hardy against the power of Bully. This was a highly competitive matchup as it went back and forth. Now we all knew that Ray was going to turn heel and join A&E but he made us all wait. When they first hit the cage he and Hardy joined forces to fend them off. Once that was over with they went back into it as daddy and daughter Hogan made their way to cage side. It wasn't too long after that when Aces & Eights returned, this time Ray didn't side with Jeff. Devon made his way into the cage and tossed Bully a hammer, Ray of course to my great delight nailed Hardy with it. This lead to him winning the title and announcing he was president of Aces & Eights. I loved the promo he cut afterwards and the scene of people throwing trash in the ring.",1379980800,,6357,4.127625201938611
8605073,3,B00EFD71DC,"The Kenny King-Christian York-Zema Ion-3 way X-Division title match was solid despite some of the sloppiness but also the innovations were appreciated. The Joey Ryan-Joseph Park match while a good comedy bout,it was better off on free TV rather then PPV. The Velvet Sky-Gail Kim-Women's title match was not great but still fine to say the least. The Robbie E-Robbie T match was not very good and felt more like a below average TV bout this side of WCW. The Austin Aries/Bobby Roode-Bad Influence(Frankie Kazarian & Christopher Daniels)-Chavo Guerrero Jr/Hernandez-3 way-Tag Team title match was a high-flying,smash-mouth showstopper. The Wes Briscoe-Kurt Angle-Steel Cage/Grudge match was  not great but solid. The Lethal Lockdown match between Aces & Eights(Garrett Bischoff,Devon,DOC,Knux & Mr. Anderson) against Team TNA(Sting,Samoa Joe,Magus,Eric Young & James Storm) was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl and a good reminder of NWA's Wargames from the 1980's. The Steel Cage/World title match between Bully Ray & Jeff Hardy was also a smash-mouth,back-and-forth brawl with a twist ending to boot. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1377820800,,1127,5.477011494252873
8605074,3,B00EFD71DC,"It should be noted that this is the first time in the history of the event that NOT every single match was held inside the steel cage as only they only saved the cage for the main event matches.

X Division Champion Kenny King vs. Christian York vs. Zema Ion - This match started out hot & kept the intensity throughout the match as it was just one high flying risk taking move after another such as it started with York doing a suicide dive onto the outside followed by King attempting to top that with an apron moonsault that had him only for Ion to follow with a corkscrew top rope dive as all three men had moments where one move had a domino effect on the other man such as King's neckbreaker off the ropes when York had Ion in a powerbomb position & Ion's top rope frankensteiner on King that had him land on York while sacrificing themselves such as the springboard legdrop by King that hurt himself.  This was a non-stop action type of match that's reminded me a bit of the earlier days of the division where they worked hard & tried a bunch of crazy spots.

Joseph Parks vs. Joey Ryan - Ryan attacked Park from behind but ended up bouncing off Parks when attempting a crossbody so tried to hit & move while taking advantage of things like his baby oil before Parks finally made his comeback grabbing Ryan by the hair (and I'm not talking about on his head) & used his body mass to his advantage.  While this was designed to be a comedy match, this was a match that should have been on Xplosion & not a PPV.

Knockouts Champion Velvet Sky vs. Gail Kim - ""The more things change, the more they stay the same"" applies here as this was the rematch from the previous year's LockDown only with this match not happening inside the cage & Velvet coming in as the champion as Velvet came in control getting early pin attempts & offense like a sitdown splash off the apron but Gail came back focusing on the midsection with kicks & a forward samoan drop but kept getting in the face of referee Taryn Terrell due to the calls she kept making that wasn't to her favor & even grabbed used her as a distract to hit Eat Defeet on Velvet but Gail eventually went too far to where Gail physically abused her causing Taryn to turn into a ""hot mess"" and finally defend herself.  The match was pretty much just a backdrop to the story of Gail abusing Taryn one too many times causing her to finally snap.

Rob Terry vs. Robbie E - This was pretty much just Robbie E attempting some moves that had no effect on him before Terry finally killed him with his power in a short dominate squash.  Another match that should have been saved for Xplosion instead of a pay per view.

Tag Team Champions Bobby Roode & Austin Aries vs. Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Bad Influence - Hernandez dominated both teams before Kaz was able to take control with a missle dropkick & worked on breaking Hernandez down only for Chavo to get the hot tag allowing Chavo to hit multiple 3 amigo suplexes but both teams singled out Chavo working him over before Hernandez again used his power such as a double backbreaker with all the action eventually breaking down with all six men getting involved with it coming down to which team could outsmart the other two.  A real good three way tag that was booked to have each team shine at some point.

Steel Cage Match: Kurt Angle vs. Wes Briscoe - Angle started out givng Briscoe a wrestling lession as he dominated him in the ring with repeated suplexes like the german & belly to belly only for a mistimed move allowed Wes to work over Angle choking him with his shirt & stomps but Angle was able to comeback throwing Wes into the cage multiple times & punishing him with 5 german suplexes causing Wes to resort to dirty low tactics & eventually catching a break when he was able to counter the anklelock sending Angle into the cage before both men where fighting on the top rope with Angle delievering the most impactful suplex yet.  This match reminded me of the phrase ""carry a broom to a great match"" because Wes was too green to be in the position he was in as he didn't come off as a threat at all for this match causing Angle to do a high majority of the wrestling &  easily the least competitive Angle match I can possibly remember since his tag match against Pacman Jones (YES, I WENT THERE!)

Lethal Lockdown Match - Team TNA vs. Aces & Eights: Sting, Magnus, Samoa Joe, James Storm, Eric Young vs. Devon, Mr. Anderson, Knux, D.O.C., Garett Bischoff - For those who haven't seen a Lethal LockDown match, it's held under the same rules of the old WCW/NWA match of War Games. One man from each team starts the match and after a 3 minute period, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each one minute time period, the teams alternate sending members in & once all team members enter the cage, the only way to win is by pinfall or submission but it should be noted that this was the first time that a roof full of weapons wasn't lowered onto the top of the cage.  Various highlights include the moments of dominance by both teams such as Samoa Joe alone & his teamwork with Magnus that reminded you of their days as tag team champions a year earlier along with Aces & Eights later in the match, Sting bringing in the trash can full of weapons such as his trademark baseball bat & trash cans which Joe was launching at people & trash can lids & chairs, a tower of doom off the cage, and a Jimmy Snuka moment for one of the participants coming off the top of the cage.  This got good towards the end of the match with the weapons & some spots but was missing something to make it really standout once the match was over.

Steel Cage Match: TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Bully Ray - Both men were evenly matched early with Bully showing his power while Hardy played to his speed but Bully got the advantage when he took Hardy down from the top of the cage with Hardy getting crotched on the way down followed up by beating on Hardy with clotheslines & forearms & a headbutt keeping Hardy grounded only for both men had to put their differences aside for a brief moment before they went back at it with Hardy attempting to go to the top only for Bully to stop him with a hard chop causing Hardy to sacrifice himself him a spinning kick & Bubba making Hardy pay with a Bubba Bomb when he went to the top again when things really started to pick up when Hulk & Brooke Hogan made their way to ringside along with Aces & Eights when we finally see who was behind the group as the ""President.""  This was a good match between both men but not their best singles encounter & was more about the story behind the involvement of Aces & Eights along with the Hogan's.

While this PPV did have some real good matches, there were too many unimportant fillers that had no business being on the show that people paid for along with the fact that this the match quality seemed to take a backseat in favor of pushing the storyline or the chemistry just wasn't there.  It was better than the previous years event but still very disappointing for what is known as one of their most important shows of the year so I recommend for a rental.",1376870400,,7198,4.3296213808463255
