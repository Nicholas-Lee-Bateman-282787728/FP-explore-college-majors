It feels ghastly and true and hideous, as intended. It was also a joy to discover Brian Cox in an early leading role.",1500681600,,296,4.60377358490566

8319110,4,B001LNOLDM,"OK, this is a black and white copy of a show that went out in color back in 1968.  Only version still available to us.  The sound could use a clean up or subtitles.  Couldn't hear much of the dialogue but I understood the idea.  Sort of borrowing from Brave New World but with TV as the way the populace is kept subdued.  The big deal about this one to modern viewers, the prediction of reality TV.  But one in which people are murdered for the audience to get off on, something that hasn't happened yet!  No extras here, basically a slightly illegal feeling to this release.",1386201600,,575,4.317757009345795
8319111,5,B001LNOLDM,"Film started off a little slow then moved into gear with very good acting by all the professorial actors, well worth watching.",1358553600,,126,4.7727272727272725
8319112,5,B001LNOLDM,The person who requested this for Christmas insists it is an excellent Sci-Fi film. Was a hit for Christmas. Arrived on time in excellent condition.,1293494400,,148,4.96
8319113,5,B001LNOLDM,"This is a movie i thought i would never see..I had heard rumours of its existence decades ago. It  should be watched by every film student,video maker,and anyone who works in media of any kind...You will find yourself
wrapped up in the story..It was written by Nigel Kneale a British writer who also wrote THE STONE TAPE and was very prominent as a writer whose stories were turned into movies(put his name in a search engine to find out more). THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS fortells, Reality television,its consequences...and how it can be a government propaganda tool. It predicts the future in which people don't go outside their homes but spend their time mainly staring at the television screen....and although sex is around, future people find it...  boring...and it is violence that gets them laughing ...You see in the future(read almost now) empathy is lacking..sound familar?",1251504000,19,884,5.006802721088436
