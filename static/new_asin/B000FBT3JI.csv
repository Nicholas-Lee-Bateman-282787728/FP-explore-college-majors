8266081,3,B000FBT3JI,"This first feature film from Fiji, or rather the Fijian island of Rotuma, written and directed by a native Fijian,

tells of an intelligent young woman who wants more than the traditional ways of her island community.

She avoids homemaking skills to aid her father with tasks such as coconut harvesting and is attracted

to his folkways and beliefs, instead of the colonially imposed Christianity. This also includes his attachment

to the Rotuman myth of the first ruler, Warrior Woman and her magic. The mostly in the Rotuman language

soundtrack, with English subtitles, is greatly enhanced by the optional English commentary track.  Although

most of the actors are amateurs, the results are better than one might expect. A fine insight into a different

culture and its members, struggling to adapt to modern Western society. Recommended.",1168560000,,844,5.2
