8074141,5,B000A3XER8,"I can't believe more people haven't discovered and reviewed this excellent DVD and for the current amazon price, you absolutely can't go wrong. I paid $8 and it's now available for $3.71!! Although somewhat dated (published in 2007, it is a classic stretch routine that I use over and over again). I hope it doesn't go out of print...

The menu system is really simple to navigate and puts you right into the workout (no individual segment menu choices, but you can hit the forward button on your remote to move ahead if you want). I love the dash-board screen during the workout. It keeps track of how much time is left in any particular stretch and how much time is left for the whole workout. It also has a line of dots along the right-hand side of the screen that shows you where you are in the workout along with tips along the bottom of the screen.

Debbie Siebers leads the stretching routine and has two others in the class. The guy is super flexible and the woman is a beginner. With their demonstrations this DVD is perfect for beginners, intermediates, and advanced users. There is slow instrumental music that has a nice beat, not too loud and doesn't put you to sleep either. Debbie provide verbal queues and tells you where you should feel the stretches along with regular reminders to breath. She doesn't not talk too much and her voice is soothing.

The whole routine is a little less than 1 hour and here's the line-up:

The routine starts with a 3 minute standing warmup and is easy and fun to follow. Then she moves into a series of standing stretches. This section lasts about 20 minutes, but the time goes by quickly. Each stretch is held for a perfect amount of time: 30-40 seconds, and again you can look up anytime to see the remaining time left for both the current stretch and the whole routine ...I LOVE THIS FEATURE!!!

Debbie moves on to a very short chair stretch of the hip and butt. It is my favorite exercise where you cross one leg over the other and she holds each side for a full minute. This is only a 3-minute segment, but very effective.

Each of the next sessions are approximate 10 minutes:

Then she moves on to all fours on the floor for a series of stretch, balance, and strengthening exercises. It is followed by a series of leg/arm holds to strength your whole body. I love this section and it is very effective in warming, exercising, and deep stretching! This section ends with wonderful child pose to stretch your lower back and cobra/child back & forth to get your hip joint juices flowing.

Then she moves you on to your back. Alternating knee to chest, then twisting, both knees in to chest, then a wonderful body elongation. She continues with hamstring stretch which is shown for beginner's modification and an advanced version. Then, the same chair hip stretch is repeated on the back. She continues with inter-leg stretch, then lower back, and fun spinal rolls.

Coming up to sitting is the next section and includes a forward bend, butterfly, then an unusual and effective knee stability exercise (I've never seen this on any of the other DVD's in my collection). She finishes this section with cross leg sitting forward bend, then a second round of wonderful neck stretches, triceps stretching, and twisting.

For the final 2 minutes of the routine Debbie has you stand up slowly, then hamstring hanging stretch and a wonderful side stretch.

This routine is one of the very best I've seen and Debbie provides exceptional instruction. Many of the exercises are traditional, but Debbie also provides a unique variation to the traditional and brand new exercises too. It's a nice mix of keeping you warm and stretching which is quite effective. Debbie talks you through each move like your own personal coach. This is absolutely what I have been looking for in a stretching routine. You absolutely won't be disappointed in this DVD!

8074142,4,B000A3XER8,"Most of the stretches are typical (there are only so many, after all), but she does have some additional exercises for the lower back, the hip joint and the knees, which are therapeutic.  The pace is mellow and Debbie is calm.  There are also a few yoga moves, like cat, child's pose and cobra.  If you have aches and pains in your back and joints, and if you like to work along with someone else in the privacy of your home, then this is an easy-going, but thorough, routine.",1276819200,13,476,4.325842696629214
