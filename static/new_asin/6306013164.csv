7899450,4,6306013164,"They say first impressions are important. Well this was my first FMW video and I was impressed. The action was great all-around. First it was supposed to be Comat Toyoda AKA ""Mother-in- Law"" vs. the Bad Nurse Nakamura. Before the match, Sub Miss Saito begged ""Mother-In-Law"" to let her wrestle the Bad Nurse. So ""Mother -in--law"" agreed. You will here the two commentators bantering so much they missed ""bad Nurse"" pinning Sub Miss. There was a female Muta named Megummi Kuddo she is one of the toughest female wrestlers I've ever seen. The announcers spend more time arguing that calling matches. The Gladiator/Hayabusa match was well put togather. Gladiator is Mike Awesome from ECW fame. There was a lights-out death match that would have been better if there was no lights out stip. There was a crazy tag team coffin match with Mr. Pogo and Horace (Hogan) Boulder vs Super Leather and Matsunaga. Matsunaga gets ... whopped all over this tape. This is a great intro to the world of FMW: Hardcore wrestling Made in Japan",1046908800,2,1022,4.8125
7899451,4,6306013164,"Well, this is the first FMW video ive ever seen, so... Was it good?  It was diferent, ill give you that, but it wasn't what I expected.  The wrestling was good and all, but the announcers where the weak spot in the thing...  They seemed more concerned with comparing the wrestlers to american wrestler, and with talking about which one of them had worse gas.....  But don't let that fool you into thinking that this thing is bad... It isn't..  Its a great video..  The DVD version has some great add ons.  The Mr. Pogo match would of been awesome, if it wasn't compleatly dark... but hey it was a lights out match (I think).  The 'Gladiator' (Mike Awesome) Vs. Hayabusa (Probably spelt wrong) match was awesome (no pun intended). All in all a pretty good DVD.... Good enough that I will probably buy some other FMW ones too...",997833600,,826,4.496644295302014
7899452,3,6306013164,"I liked this DVD alot, but I hated how some of the matches were clipped. Most it did not bother me, but the Kanemura/Tanaka match was one I REALLY wanted to see. Instead I got a 5 minutes of clips. It looked good too. I LOVED the Gladiator/Hayabusa match (shown in Full) as well as the Gladiator/Ooya vs Hayabusa, and ??. It was full too. The other DVD was much better. I hope all the matches are unedited next time. It was cool how they translated the speech!",979430400,,460,4.238636363636363
7899453,1,6306013164,"This DVD is a waste of money.  For years I've heard about how great the FMW is.  I purchased this with high expectations and was let down.  The comentators suck like nothing else, the hardcore match with Mr. Pogo is nearly impossible to watch thanks to the brilliant idea of using strobe lighting, and the rest of the matches are mediocre Monday night stuff at best. On the plus side Mike Awsome's hair is at full mulletude.  And the bonus stuff is great. Your money is better spent on the ECW DVDs.",978566400,,499,4.391304347826087
7899454,2,6306013164,"Perhaps you've heard about how great FMW is.  Perhaps you've heard how they ""invented"" hardcore wrestling.  That may be so, but this tape doesn't prove it at all.  Why?  Let me count the ways.
1)It has Horace freaking Hogan on it.  In not one but two matches.  Sure, it's better than his WCW work, but that's saying very little.
2)The announcers are annoying.  They can't convey any emotion, and their idea of insight is to rattle off the names of some old school wrestlers.  Ole Anderson wasn't the only or first wrestler to work on one body part, so why do they keep on bringing him up?  And their jokes are lame.
3)The ultra-hardcore Death Match with Mr. Pogo is a lights out match.  Meaning you can't see what's going on.  Dumb dumb dumb.
There is some good stuff on this tape.  The work of Hayabusa is amazing.  And the women's stuff is a hundred times better than their American counterparts.  But really, if you can look around on the internet you can find much better tapes than this.",973296000,4,992,4.4692737430167595
7899455,4,6306013164,I have been an FMW fan for a few years now. I have seen most of the recent stuff 98-00 and some of the old explosion matches and stuff. I must say I  prefer the recent stuff. This tape is mostly the old hardcore stuff. The  tape seems like an attempt to make FMW look very hardcore...which is a good  idea. Although I don't like the hardcore stuff the Pogo/Danger match is  good and the Hayabusa/Gladiator match is very good. I would recommend this  to any fan of hardcore wrestling.,969148800,4,483,4.322222222222222
