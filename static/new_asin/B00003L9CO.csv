1331290,5,B00003L9CO,"I am a huge fan of Dana Carvey (and, by the way, was sorely disappointed when the idiotic network honchos cancelled his terrific solo comedy show). This video is a compilation of many of the funniest and most brilliant moments from his Saturday Night Live appearances. Carvey does impeccable impressions, from George Bush to Dennis Miller (including a great clip with him imitating Miller while sitting next to him at the news desk) to Jimmy Stewart (the lost ending to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sketch is deliciously irreverent). All of the favorite characters Carvey created are here, too, e.g., Church Lady (of course!), Wayne & Garth, Hans & Franz, Grumpy Old Man, and my personal favorite, the improvising songwriter (""...she's chopping brocoli...""). Sly, satiric, clever and incredibly funny -- well worth the price of admission.",987033600,4,833,5.177777777777778
1331291,5,B00003L9CO,"What a show indeed. An awesome collection of Carvey at his best. Is there a better impressionist in world? I don't think so. He's brilliant as Perot, Bush, and Johnny Carson as well as some of his own created characters. A must SNL fans and a definite for any Carvey fan. Side splitting laughter that is as good as anything Eddie Murphy did and better than Chris Farley's (although I loved his also) stuff. Buy this!",976665600,,416,4.4868421052631575
1331292,5,B00003L9CO,"Dana Carvey is simply brilliant. To watch him is to witness magic. His unique talent helped largely to bring Saturday Night Live out of its slump,  and has made countless people take notice of the show. He is my greatest  influence and I can't say anything more than I just adore him. He is, as  Dave Letterman once put it, a national treasure. Probably even worldwide.",966038400,2,369,4.5606060606060606
1331293,5,B00003L9CO,"Dana Carvey stopped appearing as a member of the cast of Saturday Night Live in 1992, but he left behind an amazing legacy of hilarious fictional characters, while also showing himself to be one of the leading  impressionists in contemporary American comedy. During a period when SNL  was largely a hit-or-miss affair (as compared with its classic first five  years), Carvey could always be counted on to elicit guffaws when he  appeared as Garth of ""Wayne's World,"" The Church Lady, The Grumpy  Old Man, Hans the bodybuilder, or even the grossout-inducing ""Massive  Headwound Harry."" But it is perhaps as an impressionist of political  and show business personalities that Carvey showed his greatest talent.  He  became nationally famous for his George Bush impersonation, but he  repertoire included so many others: Paul McCartney, Ross Perot, Tom Brokaw,  George Michael, Keith Richard, Jimmy Stewart, Johnny Carson, Strom  Thurmond, Bob Dylan, and on and on--his ability to capture every nuance of  a character was nothing short of astounding.
This video presents an  excellent cross-section of Carvey's work, including some hilarious Church  Lady sequences, a rapid-fire series of impersonations, and a terrific  combination impression of Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall called  ""Carsenio.""  Anyone who enjoys laughing will find this video well  worth the money.
It's surprising to me that in recent years Dana Carvey  has not found a lot of new venues for his great talent. While his onetime  partner on ""Wayne's World"" Mike Myers has achieved superstar  status as ""Austin Powers,"" Carvey has more or less receded into  the show business background. Here's hoping that Dana finds his winning  show, film, or character soon.",961891200,25,1728,5.314814814814815

From his offbeat characters as Massive Headwound Harry, Hans of Hans and Franz, and most famously, Church Lady, Carvey is definitely one of the smartest comedians working today.

At once vulnerable, lovable and impressionable, he stays in your memory. His characters are top rate and makes you laugh with him and at his endearing facial gestures.

1331337,5,B00003L9CO,"This DVD is a wonderful hour of television which documents the lost and exquisite program that Saturday Night Live once was. The finest segment here is Lovitz's performance as Mephistophiles on an imaginary People's Court. Phil Hartman plays an amazing Judge Wapner while Jan Hooks is a scintillating piece of rural refuse. Actually, I replayed the People's Court bit three times because it happens to be in my Top 5 SNL moments ever. The rest of the DVD is good and includes his great rendition of the guy in the Dunkin Donuts commercials from two decades ago.

1331340,5,B00003L9CO,"I've been a fan of SNL for many years, and I've seen thousands of sketches and seen cast members come and go. However, even though I had loved Jon Lovitz in his movies like Rat Race and on his guest spots for The Simpsons, I never knew how great he was on SNL. I own 5 SNL DVDs, and this one is my favorite now. Lovitz brings so many memorable characters to the table that it's amazing I never knew about them. There's his court case as the Devil (or Mr. Mephistopheles); his Weekend Update visits as Frenchie, Annoying Man, and as himself, instructing people to get to know him (Donald Trump and Queen Elizabeth did so and look at them now!); the Liar; Hanukkah Harry; the lesser beast to Phil Hartman's beast at the drive-in; the Dunkin Donuts guy; the girl watchers with Tom Hanks (""Hello... and goodbye""); his impersonations of Michael Dukakis, Harvey Feirstein, and others; and a few Hollywood spoofs with Phil Hartman.

 With all these great skits, how could you not want this DVD? Maybe Jon Lovitz isn't the best SNL guy, but he's one of my favorites now. It's all because I got to know him, so GET TO KNOW HIM!",1137196800,9,1118,4.422330097087379

1331343,5,B00003L9CO,"This is exactly like it state's, ""The Best of Dana Carvey"" from 1986-1992.  If you are familiar with Dana Carvey in any way, you will love this DVD. If you are not familiar with him and you have any sense of humor at all, you will not be disappointed. It has a lot of great skits in it.

Dana Carvey is truly one of the funniest comedians of our time. Carvey has also been in a few movies, notably ""Wayne's World"", but my personal favorites are ""Opportunity Knocks"" and a movie for the family ""The Master of Disguise"" is hilarious. The ""Master of Disguise"" came out in 2002 and my kids are still saying ""I'm a turtle"".

Also if you ever get the chance, check out his short lived TV show from 1996 simply titled ""The Dana Carvey Show"". ABC pulled the plug on this instead of moving it to a later time slot. I wish ""The Dana Carvey Show"" would make a triumphant return to network TV, but at least we get to see Dana's comedic genius every once in a while on Letterman or Leno. And of course, this ""The Best of Dana Carvey"" DVD.",1123286400,2,1025,4.192893401015229
1331344,5,B00003L9CO,"To paraphrase a previous review, Jon Lovitz joined the cast in the notorious 1985-86 season. The show was in a bind a this point. The previous 1984 season (the last under Dick Ebersol's reign as execuitve producer) was a big hit thanks to a largely all star cast including Billy Crystal and Martin Short. Lorne Michaels returned as the show's driving force this year, and began searching for raw talrnt to bring the sho back to life. The cast he found was a large assortment of future stars, including Joan Cusack, Robert Downey Jr., Randy Quaid, Anthony Michael Hall, Lovitz, Dennis Miller and Nora Dunn. Despite a wide range of talent, the cast didn't work out, and the show was actually cancelled at one point during the summer of 1986. However, Lorne beged for another chance and did what is known in tv as an overhaul, he fired the majority of the cast but kept three promising performers: Dennis Miller, Nora Dunn and Lovitz.

Now, 20 years after joining the cast, Jon Lovitz has finally got his own best of. Although most of the best of's leave SNL fans divided, this dvd is actually a pretty accurate sampling of his work on the show.

To give a brief overview, this dvd gives us sketches featuring all of Lovitz's most popular charcters, including Tonto, Master Thespian, Mephistophilles (the devil incarnate) and the unforgettable Tommy Flannagan, Pathalogical Liar. There are also a few impressions thrown in, including a hysterical Harvey Fierstein bit that had me in stitches. There is also a montage featuring snippets of some other memorable impressions, such as Michael Dukakis (and as one reviewer mentioned, dead on), David Crosby and Queen Elizabeth. There are some sketches that I didn't like such (I could've done without ""Tales Of Ribaldry"" and especially the one with John Malcovich), but otherwise, this is a really great dvd.

The bonus materials are also very good. I didn't watch the dress sketch yet, but it looks pretty good, something about WWII. His Conan appearance is hilarious, the photo gallery a standard bonus on all best of's and his dress rehearsal is a little boring but shows his talent in progress.

Overall, this is a very well done best of for Mr. Lovitz. It's nice to see the show honoring its legends from long ago.",1118448000,8,2261,4.804627249357327
1331345,5,B00003L9CO,"I'll admit, i'm a sucker for these SNL best of series.  I usually wait awhile to get these for 10 bucks or less, but as was the case with the Will Ferrel/Jimmy Fallon dvd's, paying full price(about 15 bucks) for this right away(released as of 6/7/05) is not a bad thing.  I'm not a huge Jon Lovitz fan, but he did have some very funny bits/characters, and he was always a solid performer that was counted on to help carry the show every week(and he would deliver too).  I'm not here to review or re-cap all the sketches, too lazy for that.  Besides, either you enjoyed Lovitz or you didn't, and some sketches are better than others(we all know every collection is a hit-or-miss affair as to the selection of sketches that made the cut or not); and even with his fans, there will always be debate as to which bits better represented his talents.  So i'll just tell you why this is a particularly good edition in the series.

A. it runs about 94 minutes.  some in the series barely break 60 min!  so you're getting a decent dose of quantity here(quality i'll leave up to SNL/Lovitz fans to dissect themselves)

B. the extras are plenty, unlike some other bare bones releases in the series.  they include:

* audition: good thing i'm not a talent scout, cause i wouldn't have hired Lovitz based on his audition lol.  it's fairly brief, another snl alumni shows up(and does nothing!), and it has a tie-in to the dress rehearsal....

* photo gallery: some pics of mr. Lovitz, also fairly brief.

* dress rehearsal: a decent sketch(never before seen apparently) that also has Leslie Nielson(Police Squad/Naked Gun fame) in it.  it's a WW2 bit that has some lines you'll recognize from his auditon.

* tv appearance: from the Conan O'Brian show, this is pretty good as well. there's only one segment(in its entirety it seems) unfortunatley. i say that only because i've seen him on Conan quite a bit and this isn't the best one. but it does include his usual rants at Conan's expense.

* audio commentary: my favorite extra.  having him contribute this track really adds to the enjoyment. listening to him reminisce in the commentary is fun and informative and really adds an extra dimension to the disc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy SNL, Jon Lovitz, this 'best of' series, comedy in general, or good value in your dvd's.",1118188800,20,2318,4.623471882640587
1331346,5,B00003L9CO,"Jon Lovitz first came on the show during the notorious 1985 season, which had an incredible accumulation of acting talent (Robert Downey Jr., Joan Cusack, Anthony Michael Hall, and Randy Quaid, to name a few) but that didn't necessarily apply to sketch comedy. Lovitz, though, shined, as did Dennis Miller and Nora Dunn, and they were the only three to make it to the next year. For the next half-decade he would prove to be a versatile comic diva, bringing a wide variety of characters to the show, including the Pathological Liar (should be self-explanatory); the prince of darkness, Mephistopheles (who seemed to wind up being sued on the People's Court far more often than one might expect); Michael Dukakis (and uncannily, too), and others. Lovitz finally gets his long-overdue recognition with this DVD, and I'm grateful, since he is probably the most underrated performer ever to be on the show. At least with this DVD, SNL is moving back toward its roots, which is a positive direction since it has such history. Anyway, bottom line, this is a great DVD to have.",1115942400,40,1070,4.852459016393443
1331347,5,B00003L9CO,"Dana Carvey left ""Saturday Night Live"" 12 years ago, but he left behind a hilarious body of work only matched by Phil Hartman and Will Ferrell. He was one of the show's most vesatile performers of the classic 1986-93 years, creating a wide range of classic characters and dead on impressions. ""The Best Of Dana Carvey"" features all of his best moments from his seven year career, plus several from his eight guest appearances.

All of Dana's best charcters are here, including the Church Lady, Hans of Hans and Franz, Garth Algar, Grumpy Old Man, Ross Perot and of course, President George H.W. Bush. All of the sketches featured here are hilarious (though I would have preferred a full ""Church Chat"" bit and the 1988 and 1992 debates sketch with Bush). Also there's a great montage of all his most memorable impressions including George Michael, James Stewart, Paul McCartney and John Travolta and the infamous Il Cantore sketch. The funniest sketch is the Tom Brokaw segment where he's going over various ways of announcing Gerald Ford's deah. As the sketch progresses, each potential from of death gets more absurd, from commmiting suicide to getting eaten by wolves.

If there's any complaints I have, is that are no Ching Chang or ""Nightline"" sketches (Dana Carvey's impression of Ted Koppell was so hilarious). But still, this is a hilarious look at Carvey's amazing ""SNL"" career.",1110844800,9,1386,4.944206008583691
1331348,5,B00003L9CO,"Dana Carvey may have left ""Saturday Night live"" in 1993, but his legacy still lives on. Along with Phil Hartman, he was the most versatile actor of the show's 1986 - 94 seasons, creating a variety of classic impressions and zany characters. This dvd shows just how amazing he was in those seven years (plus the years he came back to host).
Unlike Phil Hartman's dvd, this disc I have no complaints about. If you like good, old - fashioned American comedy, then look no further here. On this dvd, Carvey's most popular comic creatiosn are here. Whether you enjoy the sarcastic Church Lady, the conceded bodybuilder Hanz or the lovable Garth from ""Wayne's World"", it's hard not to enjoy what's here. Also, there's a series of his amazing impressiosn. In additon to two hilarious George Bush sequences, most of Carvey's repetoire is hre: Ross Perot, Tom Brokaw (the funniest sketch on the whole dvd), Paul McCartney, Johnny Carson (in the infamous ""Carsenio""), John McLaughin, George ""Look At My Butt, Dennis"" Michael, Robin Leach, Prince Charles and a host of others. Even ""Massive Hoeadwound Harry"" is funny once gget past being grossed out at Carvey's bleeding head and the dog chewing on it.
This is a great dvd honoring one of the greaetst contemporary American geniuses. Highly recommended for ""SNL"" fans and anybody who enjoys laughing.",1089504000,4,1340,4.933628318584071
1331358,5,B00003L9CO,"When Dana Carvey left ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1993, he left behind a legacy of zany characters and hilarious (and dead - on)impressions. Since his departure, he has hosted 3 more times (in 1994, 1996 and 2000) and has made numerous guest appearances. This dvd captures the genius that Carvey was (and still is).
The opening sketch is a lively parody of Ross Perot's press conferences. When watching this sketch, it's hard to pinpoint whether you're watching Carvey or Perot of himself since he does him so exact. I loved him in ""The McLaughlin Group"", in which he portrays tv debate group moderator John McLaughlin as a egotistical maniac, further proof of how good ""Saturday Night Live"" at political satire. I loved the ""Church Chat"" montage, thogh I wish they had one complete sketch. The montage of his impressions is hilarious. It's amazing how well he did them, especially Robin Leach, James Stewart, George Michael and Paul McCartney, to name just a few. The Tom Brokaw sketch is better (I'm sure Crvey does him better than Chris Parnell). The Bush stuff is funny, but I wish they would ahve included the 1988 debate with the puRepublican nomiees for President, featuring one of Carvye's earliest Bush impressions.
There are many other great sketches, too many to name. I think this is a highly hilarious romp through over 10 years of classic humor.",1085961600,,1356,4.874458874458875
1331359,5,B00003L9CO,Dana Carvey was one of the kings of snl and this just hightlights some of his performances from garth to grumpy old man to church lady Carvey is hystericaly funny thats why i gave it 5 stars,1081209600,,190,4.162162162162162
1331360,5,B00003L9CO,"Dana Carvey was one of the most versatile cast members in the long history of ""Saturday Night Live"". He stayed on for 6 years (1986 - 1992) and has wound up hosting several more times over the years.
The opening sequence features Carvey as a dead - on Ross Perot, fielding questions asked by Sandler and Schneider. The dvd mainly focuses on his unique impersonations of many famous people, including Robin Leach, Tom Brokaw (the one when he's Brokaw going over ways to announce that Gerald Ford is dead is hilarious), Jimmy Stewart, Keith Richards and, of course, George Bush. Also included are some of Carvey's quirkiest characters, including Garth from ""Wayne's World"", ""Carsenio"" (a spoof of ""The Tonight Show"" featuring Carvey as Johnny Carson trying to recapture his place with the public by copying Arsenio Hall), and ""The Church Lady"", which always has me laughing.
This one of the best discs that Broadway Video has released in their long line of ""best - of"" collection. ""The Best Of Dana Carvey"" will keep you laughing no matter how many times you watch it.",1077235200,,1066,4.830601092896175
1331361,4,B00003L9CO,"This is a great DVD!  Carvey as Tom Brokaw going through all the possible ways former President Gerald Ford might perish (eaten by wolves, from an overdose of crack-cocaine, strangled by Nixon, etc) is by far the best skit on this DVD.  Carvey as Bush was of course his signature, but I wish they would have included more Presidential scenes.  There is only one Perot scene and two Bush scenes on this DVD - a few more of these (such as the Bush-Dole skit from Nov 96) would have made this a 5-star DVD.  It still is a great buy and I highly recommend it.",1073174400,2,555,4.257142857142857
1331362,5,B00003L9CO,This collection was great.  George Bush is one of my favorites but the best is Carsenio;the person that said that skit was boring is an idiot....Carsenio RULES,1072137600,,159,4.888888888888889
1331363,3,B00003L9CO,"I ordered this DVD (along with several others from the 'best of' collection) because I used to really enjoy watching SNL when I was an undergraduate in CA and because it is unavailable in Europe. This DVD has some mediocre to good skits with Dana Carvey from SNL, but does not include a single full skit of ""Church Chat"" opting instead for a ""Church Chat Montage"" which has small snippets of various church chat skits. I found it quite annoying to watch a few seconds of a skit and then have it cut short - I wanted more. My rating of three stars is because I think several full-length skits of 'Church Chat' should have been included as they were one of the most popular (and one of my favourites). For those of you who can tape episodes when they appear as re-runs, I would suggest doing that rather than buying this DVD. A disappointing 'best of' for a great SNL cast member.",1030320000,19,878,4.392638036809816
1331364,5,B00003L9CO,"I am a foreigner and did not start watching SNL until after Carvey had left the show. I first saw him live when he hosted the show in 1998 where he was in a NPR skit. His impersonation and performance left me with such a enduring impression that I believe it is in my subconscious now. This DVD showed me a more complete version of his talent. Then just as I thought he couldn't be more funny, I watched the special features (why it is not part of the main program I'll never understand), which had his audition tape and Hanz/Franz finale. Boy, was it a blast!",1014768000,,560,4.242990654205608
1331365,5,B00003L9CO,"I am a big fan of SNL and have really enjoyed Dana's work in the past. I hesitated before I bought this dvd not sure if it would be another effort to cash in on a poorly put together dvd... However I was impressed with what I saw. The DVD contained some of my favourite of Dana's moments including some Waynes world skits, Church Chat, his hillarious impression of Dennis Miller, George Bush and my personal favourite the skit where he plays the psychic contestant on a gameshow... It made me sad watching it all knowing that Dana wasn't doing as much as he should be now! The best part though was in the special feature not listed here ""Dana's original uncut audition for SNL"" this rare never before seen piece is worth the price of admission alone! Check it out for fans of Saturday Night Live or just people who appreciate fine comedians.",1003708800,7,841,4.467532467532467
