3756546,2,B001PR0YEE,"When my wife and I went to see Planet 51, it was a Sunday night in the pouring rain.  We were the only people in the theater.  And that was apt, because we're probably the only adults who actually bothered to see the movie and got all the jokes.

On Planet 51, things are looking up for Lem (Justin Long), an aspiring assistant manager for the local planetarium.  He just got the job and he's about to ask out the girl next door, Neera (Jessica Biel).  Until an ""alien"" shows up.  And that alien is Captain Charles (Chuck) T. Baker (Dwayne Johnson), a human astronaut.

Chuck, you see, has landed on a planet he thought was uninhabited. His job was to plant a flag, play a few rounds of interplanetary golf, and then get back to his ship and report home. But all those plans are threatened by the military that wants to dissect him, embodied by the sinister General Grawl (Gary Oldman) and the resident mad scientist Professor Kipple (John Cleese).

On the one hand, Planet 51 wants to entertain the kiddies.  It features a computer-rendered world full of lush retro-futuristic landscapes rendered through a 1950s lens. It has rocket ships, aliens both benign and belligerent, and not one but TWO cute dogs-that-aren't-dog characters.

On the other hand, Planet 51 wants to be an action homage to the sci-fi of yesteryear. It features characters smooching, gunfire, 50s-style nostalgia, 50s-style paranoia, and references to genitalia.

The problem is that Chuck's kind of a jerk.  Put in the role of the kindly extraterrestrial, Chuck can't pull it off - he's not above intimidating people, playing into their worst fears, lying to get what he wants, and his cries of ""not having the right stuff"" are hard to believe given that he's, ya know, an ASTRONAUT.  Lem spends most of the movie whining about not getting the girl, Chuck spends most of the movie whining about not getting home, and the only reason the plot moves forward at all is because Rover (one of the two aforementioned ""dogs"") saves the day.

In fact, Rover steals the show.  Cleverly designed to look like a cross between the Mars rover and a dog, Rover propels the plot on his tiny wheels alone.  If the movie was more about Rover and got rid of Chuck, it would have been a much more entertaining film.

Instead, Planet 51 teeters between tedious characters arguing, simplistic moralizing (Lem explains to the General that he's ""afraid of the unknown."" Really?), and lame side plots that are just mean-spirited (two citizens have their brains removed...hilarious!).

If you're a twelve-year-old boy who happens to remember 1950s science fiction movies, E.T., Populuxe architecture, Aliens, and The Right Stuff, then this movie's for you.  But since the odds of that happening are about as realistic as a planet full of half-dressed English-speaking aliens, adults will likely find Planet 51 too childish and the shout-outs to older sci-fi will go over the kids' heads.",1260748800,10,2936,4.836
3756547,4,B001PR0YEE,"I was a bit surprised to see the chilly reviews of most of the critics (the movie got an average C in the Yahoo critics review). I saw the movie with my 8 years old and we both enjoyed it a lot. It is a fun little movie which includes parody on many sci fi movies as well as on the 50's Americana. It's true that there are many references and puns pointing to other movies but in my eyes this was part of the fun and not 'unoriginal copying' as some critics claimed. I was especially proud when my son identified the scene from Singing in the Rain! My own favorites were a killer, acid-urinating pet formed after the monster in 'Alien', and the paranoid general in sun glasses which reminded me of Jack D. Ripper from 'Dr. Stragelove'.
I saw some complaints about the 'simplicity' of the graphics, it's true they are not in the league of 'Shrek' or 'Bolt' but they do just fine in the context of the movie. Overall I will not claim this is a ground breaking movie in any way, but I enjoyed it more than 'Monsters vs. Aliens' which covers a somewhat similar teritorry and which we saw earlier this year.",1259971200,40,1102,4.277511961722488

3756875,5,B001PR0YEE,"It's interesting and has quite a few original ideas. I don't think I ever thought of things that way that we are the aliens as far as aliens are concerned and they think we want to get them just like we think they want to get us. What is too fictitious is that they speak English. Why would they speak English in another planet? I understand that they do it so that we can understand them but still. They make it seem that they cant read English when they claim the twix bar says surrender or die and the barcode is a list of surrender terms, yet the cars say VW and they all speak English so that doesn't work out that well.
I still give it 5 stars because it is interesting and thought provoking. I guess kids see what they see but as an adult, these are my thoughts. Watch it and let me know in the comments if you agree.",1483574400,,824,4.061349693251533

It was pretty interesting seeing the actors talk about the movie and I didn't realize some of the voices who are actors that I love. I don't normally pay much attention to credit unless I recognize my voice, so that was kind of neat seeing their views on the film and it was fun for me to watch. My kids were completely uninterested when they realized it wasn't the movie. We actually have this movie on DVD, but I just wanted it on Amazon so they could do it easily on their tablets.

3757072,1,B001PR0YEE,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Awash in sci-fi films genre and 1950s pop-culture references, PLANET 51 is an animation film that I would have to say was grossly under-appreciated during its cinema run. Once I popped the Blu-ray Disc in my player, I found myself under the spell of PLANET 51, which I turned out to be beautifully animated and really quite funny. The plot of PLANET 51 is a pastiche of paranoid 1950s science fiction movie clichs, all of which are given a wide-eyed, but knowing spin, that have been designed to tickle fans of this particular genre. The said premise places the story of PLANET 51 on a planet that populated by little green men and little green women, whose society resembles that of 1950s America.

In the midst of this alien suburbia is Lem (voiced by Justin Long), a teenaged alien who has gotten a job at the local planetarium museum and has a crush on Neera (voiced by Jessica Biel), the girl next door. Lem finds his typical teen existence complicated by an alien spacecraft touching down in his backyard during a barbecue. From out of the alien spacecraft emerges NASA Astronaut Charles 'Chuck' Baker (voiced by Dwayne Johnson), who is shocked to discover this supposedly uninhabited world to be much inhabited. Of course, paranoia about an alien invasion immediately besets the community, with our NASA astronaut on the run from a typically gung hoe military. While dodging the army and trying to get back to his spacecraft, Chuck manages to convince Lem that he means the people of his planet no harm. However, General Grawl (voiced by Gary Oldman) is convinced the alien intends to transform the local populace into ""zombies"" under extra-terrestrial control, so swaying him to Chucks cause is going to be impossible. Making matters even worse for Chuck is Professor Kipple (voiced by John Cleese), the supposed ""expert"" on all things alien, who is determined to separate the mind-controlling alien from its brain.

There is non-stop action along with some fantasy violence along the way. In one scene, a robot which resembles Wall-E crushes a bug. One character is hit in the head by a spinning telescope which is accidentally bumped. There are a few innuendos but overall this is an entertaining and funny animated film. There is also the theme of helping others out and not judging someone too quickly. The kids at the preview I attended laughed heartily several times and none of them seemed frightened. I recommend this animation film for all ages, but some parents will be more comfortable in allowing more mature children viewing this animation film. Visit PLANET 51 today! You will have a great enjoyable time for 105 minutes and you will definitely not be disappointed.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Entertainment in Video for the UK has made PLANET 51 available on Blu-ray Disc with a very pleasing 2.35:1 aspect ratio presentation. The 1080p presentation is nothing short of superb, which is exactly how it should be. This CGI animated film has been transferred directly from the digital files, the image on this Blu-ray release is computer-generated perfection. Planet 51 has been beautifully textured and every bit of fine detail is readily apparent, in addition to the image delivering marvellous levels of sharpness, clarity and dimensionality. Colours are fully saturated, yet completely stable. Blacks are pitch perfect, while the whites demonstrate the same kind of straight from the computer realm perfection. Additionally, contrast demonstrates the kind of smoothness that can only be created in the digital realm. As I stated above, the presentation comes directly from the digital files, so there is no grain, nor will one find any visual imperfections in the image. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  PLANET 51 is presented on this Blu-ray Disc with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Much of Planet 51 is dialogue driven, but the dialogue moments are interspersed between mild comic actions and chase sequences. The sound design is effective and fun, with the outlying channels keeping up with the onscreen action very well, even if the track falls just a tad shy of demo quality. Additionally, the track is nicely atmospheric and filled with plenty of little sounds that help complete the films sonic environments. Thanks to the lossless encode, fidelity is terrific for the musical component, as well as the sound effects. The bass channel packs the entire necessary rumble that the sound effects require. Voices have a warm, natural quality, plus the films dialogue is always completely understandable.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature TV Special: Life On Planet 51: Behind-the-Scenes Feature [1080p] [12:00] Covering everything from the voice acting, to the storyboards, to the final animation, this feature is your basic making-of piece that comes standard nowadays. A lot of promotional stuff is thrown in here too.

Special Feature: Planetarium Sizzles: The Voice Stars of Planet 51  [1080p] [3:00] A short piece that features several cast members describing their characters and their place in the plot, with little emphasis on the actual voice work, aside from some behind-the-scenes footage of the actors behind the microphone.

Special Feature: PLANET 51 Music Video Montage [1080p] [2:00] Contains clips from the animation film playing against rock tunes from the soundtrack. What I don't understand is the choice to feature music from The Killers and Blink 182.

Special Feature: Extended Scenes [1080p] [3:00] This feature takes us on an un-narrated tour of ' PLANET 51's numerous CGI sets.

Special Feature: Animation Progression Reels [1080p] [16:00] This is the only feature even remotely worth watching in this whole lot. It showcases six scenes from the film in four stages of progression, each placed in a box across all four corners of the screen. Highlighted scenes include Chuck's Landing [2:23]; Chuck on the Run [1:12]; The Chase [3:05]; Gas Station [2:49]; General's Orders [2:20]; and Showdown With the General [4:35].

Special Feature: Short Cut: Origins of Planet 51 [1080p] [12:04] This is a fairly basic making-of piece that features cast and crew speaking on the story and moving on to look at the process of lending voiceover work to the film, the quality of the voice actors, the design of the alien world, and the computer effects used in the process.

Special Feature: The World of Planet 51 [1080p] [2:54] This simply is a compilation piece that showcases some of the locales found throughout the film.

Special Feature: Exclusive to Blu-ray ""Target 51"" Game with optional iPhone controller App download from iTunes! [1080p] This is for users to play a game through two different modes: Galaxy and Survival. Galaxy mode challenges players to shoot incoming spacecraft from a first-person perspective in level one, dodge objects in a third-person mode in level two, and blast asteroids in level three, the final level a nothing more than a rip-off of Asteroids. Survival Mode is simply level three of Galaxy Mode.

Sneak Previews: Space Chips and Valiant

Finally, PLANET 51 offers a funny spin on the fifties sci-fi films genre, as well as being a beautifully animated CGI film. The animation film looks as good as anything put out by PIXAR, even with the filmmakers' ability to get away with practically texture less alien creatures. Most of the best material will find favour only with adults, but children should still get a kick out of the animation film's generic but whacky characters, bright visuals, and innocently fun tone. Entertainment in Video UK Blu-ray release of Planet 51 is solid. Science Fiction fans owe it to themselves to check the animation film out, and no doubt the children will beg their parents to add it to the Blu-ray library. But what I cannot understand is that why people haven't pointed out that this animation film is very similar to the 3D Blu-ray of Escape From Planet Earth animation film. To sum up the Blu-ray is totally gorgeous, and the best way to view PLANET 51 at home via your Home Cinema set-up. Highly Recommended!

All the funny and interesting (rather limited anyway) portions were ruined, in my mind, because of it.

The graphics and characters are a great blend of family fun and futuristic ""what if"" type dialog. The lack of abusive or insulting language was also refreshing from a parental perspective. Other shows have had my children mimicking words like ""stupid"" or ""dummy"" a little too much for comfort.
Planet 51 was also a ""watchable"" show for the adults of our home. One that was not so absolutely childish that you just sit there and act like you are paying attention while your kids watch. You can follow the dialog and if you like ask your children questions or inspire imagination in them based up on the story. All in all a pretty good show.",1399939200,,751,4.489051094890511

This guy for sure resembles somewhat like DWAYNE from his glimery smile and his cool charisma. I guarantee that PLANET 51 will be a good treat for all the kids, especially If they decide to watch this with their friends on HALLOWEEN FREIGHT NIGHT.

3758129,2,B001PR0YEE,"It's a featurETTE.  That means it's more like a long trailer.  The movie seems like it might be fun, but this really is more what-the-heck? than anything else.  Because it does say [Featurette] on the description, I can't say it was a surprise, but with the ability to put trailers up online, why even make a 'product' like this?

After downloading and watching the featurette, my family decided it was worse than a waste of time and actually made us all less interested in the movie.  If this is a new marketing strategy, Sony Pictures, don't use it again.  It's just irritating to download something like this as if it were an actual movie clip or... SOMETHING worthwhile, and find out it really is just a long trailer.

I would have given it a single star if I'd paid money for it.  Being free, I didn't lose anything other than time and interest in the actual movie.

Bottom line: It's a trailer and nothing more.  Treating it like it's something different only made us more upset that we wasted time watching it.",1362441600,,1017,4.538461538461538

3758291,4,B001PR0YEE,"I purchased this movie because last year, in second grade, my daughter suddenly became very afraid at the very thought of aliens.  (There were a few kids in her class scaring the heck out of the rest.)  After nearly a year of tip-toeing around the topic, the problem has gotten worse.  So, I decided it is time to show her that aliens are only scary if she makes them scary.  I have been hunting for every friendly/funny child version of aliens to be found.

The first few minutes are the 'scariest' with an alien attack being depicted.  (Scary being subjective, of course, since most eight-year-olds would have no issue with the scene.)  After that, this movie started working its magic.  It is funny and very entertaining, even my husband stayed for the whole thing (he takes the 'family' out of 'animated family film').

Right from the start, Planet 51 jumps in and embraces all of our alien stereotypes and beliefs, having cleverly reversed the roles.  I especially appreciated the subtle inferences (look for what we call a meteor shower).  There are also many nods to other films, songs, and pop culture figures.  These guys are living in the 50's, and the storyline is enhanced by that setting.

Planet 51 defintely deserves favorable consideration if you are on the fence, wondering if it will be as entertaining as it looks like it should be.

One thing - this item is supposed to be a 2-disc Blue Ray/DVD combo.  It's not.  There is a blue ray disc, and there is a second disc they call a DVD.  The 'DVD' is a disc you can use to play the movie on your computer or play station.  Even if that is okay by you, the 'DVD' feature needs a code to activate it and allow the download.  The code expired in March of 2011.  This explains the incredibly discounted price.  You are not getting a combo pack.  This is, effectively, just one disc - and do not purchase it unless you can play a blue ray.",1343779200,3,1901,4.497076023391813

It isn't on a par with some of the other animation movies out there, but it is nowhere near being really bad.

The producers of most all movies these days--not just animated films--create a short production like this one both as an extra feature for the eventual DVD of the film and as a form of promotion for the film just before and during the time it is being released in theaters.

It's a what if a race of green aliens were just like humans in the 1950s and had fears of ""aliens"" eating their brains, controlling their minds and other creepy actions. Rampant themes of prejudice and how a society can destroy itself by obsessing over its fears. Notable voices by  Dwayne Johnson, Jessica Biel, Justin Long, Gary Oldman, Seann William Scott, and John Cleese.

It's about an astronaut (Dwayne Johnson's character) who visits a planet covered with green alien creatures (who happen to speak perfect english- yeah I know, talk about a totally *weird* coincidence!)

Anyway the storyline is that the astronaut becomes friends with one of the green aliens, and it's the aliens job to hide the astronaut from the rest of the planet who considers the astronaut an alien himself, which would therefore mean being killed against his will.

Of course the objective here is to get the astronaut back to his spaceship and therefore back to his home planet without being caught... yeah, THAT won't happen so easily!

My favorite character (who actually surprised me by getting a fair amount of attention) was Rover, the little machine satellite photographer creature that resembled a dog.  Trust me, this little thing was *adorable*, haha!  I especially liked the segment where it met up with another dog roaming the neighborhood and they both sniffed each other out like typical dogs, lol.  This dog however, had a long attachable tongue of some sorts perfectly illustrating an alien dog.

I didn't realize it until the movie was over, but apparently Dwayne Johnson was going through an outerspace-themed period of his career when you consider this film along with Race to Witch Mountain were released around the same time (another solid adventure movie).

Just got finished watching this movie and I REALLY ENJOYED IT. Maybe it's because I went in expecting to watch a
decent movie after all the negative and plain hateful reviews I read before I bought it. The main reason I took a chance on this film was because it had an original story and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. It's full of laughs, a few touching moments and overall it's a great little adventure.

If you pay attention to all the little details of this movie like the hidden tributes, the soundtrack and the voices behind the characters I think you'll really love it. From alien cars designed like a VW Vanagon, to throwbacks to ET and the Alien dog it's a fun adventure. And voices of The ROCK, Stiffler, Gary Oldman, John Cleese make a stellar cast.

As for PQ the details are great, colors are bright and lighting is wonderful. The designers behind this movie are game animators with high attention to detail.

As for the audio it's very well done. The voice levels are balanced throughout the movie, the surrounds are well
utilized (love the helicopters flying around), and the music was a perfect match.

So if you have kids over say 7 and if you like Scifi you should own this movie, screw all the negative reviews;

The animated pic ""Planet 51"" - a Spanish/English/American co-production directed by Jorge Blanco - turns the sci-fi genre on its ear by having the earthlings be the alien invaders from outer space rather than the other way around.  The planet that NASA astronaut Charles ""Chuck"" Baker (Dwayne Johnson) lands on looks and sounds suspiciously like a space age version of the 1950s, where English is the spoken language, rocks fall like rain from the sky, rock'n'roll classics blare out from every radio and jukebox, malt shops and bowling alleys serve as the primary venues for recreation and socializing, cheesy science fiction movies dominate the culture, and women in poodle skirts and bouffant hairdos ride around in cars that don't touch the ground.  Lem (Justin Long) is a local teen who hides Baker when mass hysteria on the part of the community threatens this stranger from outer space with imprisonment, dissection or worse.

Most of the humor in this sly parody of ""E.T."" and the original ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" derives from the anachronisms of the setting, as pop culture references, both old and current, pour forth from the screen with reckless abandon.  The screenplay by Joe Stillman isn't always as sharp and sophisticated as the idea behind it would warrant, but the action is fast-paced, the voice work spot-on and energetic (with major assists from Jessica Biel, Gary Oldman, Seann William Scott and John Cleese), and the visual style so cheerful and appealing that only a total meanie would expend time pointing out the movie's few imperfections.  In many ways, it's less pretentious and more fun-loving than some of the more arty and cerebral Pixar extravaganzas of recent times - which makes it a nice fit for old and young alike.",1287532800,,1768,4.996598639455782

3758446,4,B001PR0YEE,"Watch the Skies -- There are Humaniacs Amongst Us!

What a fun movie!  Just don't think too hard about it -- another planet that emulates the 1950s, complete with barbecues (but floating burgers) and flower-child VW Mini-busses (but float!).

This world that is 1950s but alien gets visited by a guy from Earth (complete with American NASA spacesuit) claims the planet for the USA but freaks when he finds a world full of aliens!

Rover (Mars Rover, get it?), our friendly little robot, loved rocks so much that he neglected to say the place was inhabited!

yeah, the adventure did have a lot of potential and there are a few places where the film is really just plain boring.

I loved several references:  Rover spinning around a lightpole with an umbrella to the tune ""Singing in the Rain!""  The ""Alien"" dog with the acid pee.  And so on!

What saved it for me was not only the early sci-fi references (singing the 2001: A Space Odyssey) or the funky music references (the Macarena is painful!) but the lessons learned -- that being different, and facing the unknown, you can either run from it or embrace it as a force for change.

Is the unknown the end of all you know or just a new beginning?  Despite the silly hijinx and the slapstick comedy, that theme was really at the crux and I could really appreciate that.

The animation is not the slick & polish of Pixar, but the music soundtrack is hilarious!

So no, this movie is not for the cynical critic who wonders why everyone speaks English or why the planet is a copy of the 1950s.  It's a sweet popcorn entertainment pure and simple.

Recommended for young kids.",1283817600,,1623,4.544827586206897
3758447,3,B001PR0YEE,"As far as premises go, it's tough to beat Planet 51's: Take the clich&eacute; alien movies of the 1950s and reverse the formula- instead of a good-hearted alien coming to Earth, send a good-hearted human to an alien world (that just so happens to look just like earth in the 1950s) hence making mankind the alien.

There are many layers of brilliance in this structure and after taking in multiple previews that showed a film that seemed to capitalize on all of this cleverness, it was with great anticipation that I went into this one.  Sadly it falls pretty short of the expectations I laid out for it beforehand.  But more on that later.

The story follows the alien Lem (voiced by Justin Long), a misguided teenage astronomer who works at the local observatory.

Not unlike teens on earth, Lem crushes on his next-door neighbor Neera (voiced by
Jessica Biel), who finds herself rather taken with a hippie protester; the opposite of the preppy astronomer-type if you will.

The small suburban community they call home is flipped upside down when an authentic spaceship from another world happens to land in Lem's backyard. The alien turns out to be one Captain Chuck Baker (voiced by former wrestler Dwayne Johnson in a nearly unrecognizable performance), a slightly egotistical, block headed NASA astronaut with genuine good intentions.

See Chuck, it turns out, along with his robotic companion Rover (who was a dog-like probe sent to the planet prior to his arrival) are stranded on Planet 51 with only a matter of days to return to the landing capsule so they can return to the orbiting mother ship before its automatic pilot activates, sending it back to Earth.

Lem halfhearted helps Chuck with his mission to get home despite the risk of bing a traitor to his planet if discovered by the anti-alien, fear-mongering General Grawl (voiced by the ever-versatile Gary Oldman).

Yes it's a cute premise, yes there is creativity potential just bursting out of every nook and cranny but no, the filmmakers have somehow skimped over these aspects to deliver what could very well be one of the sloppiest animated features of all time.

For starters we have this alien world that is nearly identical to 1950s earth on down to our own musicians playing on their radios! Huh? Did they intercept our radio wave transmissions? If so why not say mention this?  Is it possible we intercepted theirs back then? Oh jeez, anyway none of this is explained nor is the timeframe of earth ever presented.  Is Chuck from modern day earth or is it the 1950s back here as well? It may even be our own distant future considering, at present, we're unable to travel to planets outside of our own system.

Anyway, this is a kids film after all so don't let me wax poetic about the scientific plot holes.  However, it's still got problems even these flaws exempted!  The 1950s references (and they are a plenty) will be 99.9% lost upon the intended audience.  How many kids these days know that 1950s cars had tail fins or that the pompadour and letterman's jacket was all the rage back then? Half the adults I know didn't get that!

Then there are the movie spoofs- the residents of the planet keep acid breathing pets that were transplanted from the ALIEN films, there's a rover that borrows heavily from Wall-E without any of the charm, there are Star Wars quotes and Terminator impressions.. Not crimes in their own right of course, but the humor here just never establishes any sort of rhythm.  The jokes are rather all over the place in terms of intended age groups and complexity but none are really too funny.

Additionally the film simply doesn't flow or wrap-up quickly enough to hold most children's interest.  Couple this to references and gimmicks that few, if any, younger folk will understand and you end with an animated film that makes you kind of wonder who in the world this thing is really for.

I wouldn't say it's unwatchable by any means but in conclusion, this is a rather muddled finished product that fails to deliver on the clean animation and clever premise that make it seem so worthy initially.  The biggest tragedy is the opportunities missed- this one is fair but it feels like it worked hard to avoid greatness.",1283817600,,4224,4.749658002735978
3758448,4,B001PR0YEE,"When we say that Planet 51 has a predictable story, and many reviewers have, we need to take a perspective break. If this movie was solely for adults, then it would fail to do a complete job of entertaining us. However, this type of animated movie is made for kids. They have not seen the hundreds or thousands of movies that we adults have, and so the plot won't be quite as predictable for them. The movie is meant to be watched by families, with the primary focus on it entertaining the kids. To that end, it does a fine job, and throws the adults quite a few bones at the same time.

The human astronaut who lands on a planet which is supposed to be barren, as reported by the robot rover which was sent to scout it, is not overly sympathetic to begin with. However, both he and the planet's inhabitants grow a lot during the course of this story. The positive revelations and character growth in the movie are good role model story for kids without being preachy. That aspect of the movie was well done.

As usual for these modern computer animated movies, this film is a visual feast. Textures are omnipresent and rich. Details of a sideways 1950s type culture on an alien world are interesting and amusing. The smoke trails of the rocket ship launches are unbelievably realistic.

My favorite character, and I am probably not alone, is the incredibly adept robot ""Rover"", who is still functioning and helpful when the manned mission arrives on the world.

So this is probably not a movie for a ""date night"" for a couple. But for a family on a Sunday afternoon, it fit the bill solidly.",1283040000,,1592,4.479310344827586

The character design is a bit simple, but the animation is striking and beautiful and the world created is wonderful to look at. I loved the soundtrack and the characters grew on me as the film progressed.

Considering we've had two films recently with a sci-fi premise, this film and the other being 'Monsters VS Aliens' I found the creature design to be better in 'Monsters VS Aliens' and the story to be better in 'Planet 51' Although the H.R. Giger Alien dog was top notch comic relief in 'Planet 51' .  I enjoyed both films and both were made with sci-fi film buffs in mind.

I bought the Blu Ray DVD combo pack and I hope this is a practice that prevails for a long time. I'm not ready to fully commit to Blu Ray and I like getting a copy of both formats in one package.

I loved the 50's throwback element and the characters were very easy to like. Overall just a great movie that we enjoyed far more than most of what we've seen lately.

3758452,4,B001PR0YEE,"This film is very much a parody of classic sci-fi/fantasy/adventure films even though the primary audience seems to be preteen and teen audiences.  Nearly every scene has references to at least one if not several such films.  Some of the more obvious references include ""Aliens"", ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Battlestar Galactaca"", ""Star Wars"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Incredible Hulk"" (or perhaps ""Night of the Comet"") and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"".  As a buff of such films, I enjoyed seeing the creators of Planet 51 poking fun / paying homage to these great films of the past in a light hearted, almost whimsical way.

The script of this film is very creative in portraying humans as the invading aliens, and does make a good point that  judging others based on our own preconceptions is harmful, and likely to cause alot of hurt for all concerned.  The movie is a bit lightweight in its presentation of this; but given the intended audience, a deep and philosophical exploration of this topic would have been a mistake.

As for the animation, I enjoyed the clean, colorful world of ""Planet 51"".  it is clear the creators put a great deal of effort into re-envisioning classic 1950's/1960's automobiles as floating bubble-shaped cars for aliens: a very cute idea.  Character design and animation was also quite good.

All in all, I'll give it four stars: not a film that will be remembered as a classic, but certainly fun to watch.  I'm sure this will be one of those Blu-Ray discs that my little boy will enjoy watching (over and over and over again) when he gets a bit older!",1280361600,,1632,4.792857142857143

It was `ok' to watch, but that's it. The kids were not really into it. They watched it, but there was no `spark'. Our 5 year old stopped watching after 15 minutes.

The ""baby boomers"" will get the references to classic SciFi movies and the rest will get a kick out of the comedy and references to newer movies. The story revolves around an American astronaut that lands on a planet full of green aliens with antennae. They are living in a slightly different version of our 1950s. The rage at their theaters are space invasion movies with creatures with one eye that use mind control and suck out brains. The inhabitants of Planet 51 act in typical 1950s fashion when the astronaut lands with the population scared and the military on high alert and ready to shoot first and ask questions later. When a young astrologist befriends the astrounaut his life changes dramatically from being popular to being hunted down. The local scientist wants to cut out their brains for experiaments if the mitlitary doesn't kill them first. Although this all may sound morbid it is handled in a comedic fashion and suited for the whole family.

3758469,3,B001PR0YEE,"With all of the star power voicing the film (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, John Cleese, among others), I was hoping that this film would be better than what it was. It's a very cute film, but overall it just seems to lack ""the right stuff"" necessary in order to stand out against the myriad of other computer animation films out there.

Planet 51 is about an alien planet that seems to be stuck in the 50s, complete with cute 50s soundtrack. When the earthling astronaut Chuck lands on the planet, everyone instantly views him as a threat to their safety & a round of ""you're an alien zombie"" begins. Native Len must not only help Chuck get back to his ship & get home, as well as try to romance the girl next door.

This was a cute enough film that originally had the bad luck to be released just after The Fantastic Mr Fox & just before The Princess & The Frog. It never really had a chance, which is a shame because it is cute enough to capture the attention of many kids & since there haven't been many kid films about aliens in the last year or two, it would be a fresh enough of a movie topic.

Unfortunately the film just seemed to lack pizazz. The animation is good & everyone does a decent acting job, but the plot & some of the characterizations were just lackluster. I was a little irritated with the depiction of the astronaut Chuck- he was played as little more than a pompous fool. I understand the need for comedic effect, but at times the movie really needed someone to play it serious- the constant ""jokey"" feeling to the movie just kept it from really getting that great feeling to it.

It'll still entertain the kiddos for a few hours, but parents will probably find their attention wandering, which is a shame- the mark of a great kid film is one where the parents will be just as entertained as the kids are.",1275177600,2,1826,4.330409356725146
3758470,3,B001PR0YEE,"Planet 51 is one of those idea's that look good on paper, but usually end up failing to make the jump from concept to production.  This movie was a real disappointment because I was really looking forward to it coming out; primly because it was written by Joe Stillman.  So I was naturally assuming that this movie would be a Sci-Fi version of Shrek filled with all the humour and loveable characters that made the first two Shrek movies so great.  What we got was a patch-work Frankenstein of beautiful design and badly thought out plot & characters.

Planet 51 follows the mis-adventures of American astronaut, Charles ""Chuck"" T. Baker as he lands on an unknown planet and discovers that it's not as uninhabited as he thought.  After slap-stick freak out, Chuck finds himself stranded and is forced to rely on help from the reluctant Lem Korplog; An amateur astronomer who's own perfect life has been turned upside down by Chuck's decision to choose him as his new best friend.  Thus the two are forced to partner up and get Chuck back home before time runs out.

One of the major problems with this story is that none of the characters come across as they should.  Chuck doesn't feel like an alien, but rather someone who lives down the street.  Lem and Nerra's relationship feels forced.  Nerra herself comes across as too perfect without an flaws.  Ekle could've been put to some good use but instead comes across as annoying.  Finally, the three characters of Skiff, Grawl and Kipple succeed too well at being deliberately idiots, to the point where the lines that are meant to draw laughs just draw groans.

The plot it's self was another big disappointment, as it seemed to Snooker-Loop into uninteresting angles, and the majority of the jokes were all aimed at those below the age of 12.  (Not one but TWO poop jokes barely within 2 minutes of each other.)  The moral of the story is ""Don't Fear the Unknown,"" but the whole movie is put together so haphazardly that when it is finally spelt out for the audience, it feels tossed in.  It wasn't as though it was a bad movie. There were parts I really enjoyed and there were moments where you could see it was trying to be a great movie; but for every good moment, it unbalanced it's self with three ridicules moments.  I really wanted to like Planet 51, honestly I did. But it just wouldn't let me.

But having seen the movie a few times over, I've come to see it has it's own uniqueness which kept me coming back.  The movie needs to be viewed a few times to understand and appreciate it fully and the artistic design of the whole movie is undeniably beautiful.  The concept of reverse ET is great, and the moral of ""Don't Fear the Unknown,"" - which has been done to death - comes across in a way that doesn't feel worn out.  It's these reasons that keeps it from getting two stars.",1274918400,5,2841,4.52054794520548

3758472,5,B001PR0YEE,"Planet 51 is probably the the funniest sci-fi animated film I've seen. The animation is great - better in my opinion than the much-vaunted Pixar. The best part of the movie was its sly references and characters of other sci-fi classics. The two ""dogs"" - the alien dog (based on H.R. Giger's Alien) and the human astronaut's rover - steal the show. However, the rest of the cast works well (and Jessica Biel manages to stay hot even with green skin).

3758489,4,B001PR0YEE,"On the surface this movie looks like a one trick pony that plays up a singular gag concept of role reversing the alien invasion theme that has been used on probably hundreds of different films and television programs. We have an alien planet with a culture identical to ours circa the 1950's (the pinnacle of the Cold War era) that is visited by an Earth astronaut. All heck breaks loose as the military freaks out over the alien ""invasion"" while the public reeks of terror built up by all those alien monster movies they have been watching over the years. So yeah that's a fun joke that won't go very far. Good thing Planet 51 knows how to milk the concept.

So yeah. It's funny when you first see the astronaut thinking he just planted the American flag on a deserted planet only to find out he's right in the middle somebody's back yard barbecue. It's funny when he's running around in his space suit scaring people as much as he is scared. Those gags would only take a movie so far. Good thing we get a good deal more than that. There are plenty of really fun sight gags, pratfalls, inside jokes, and mayhem to keep the laughs up beyond the big concept joke. There are also interesting parallels to our own culture and even some well executed life lessons type character development.

It's hard to pick out what makes this movie most fun, but one really good one is the various 50's (and 60's) and classic sci-fi references peppered throughout the film. The references go all over the place. Movies like Alien, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, American Wedding, Singing in the Rain, and E.T. (to name just a few). Songs like Bob Dylan's The Times, They Are a Changing. Even 50's comic books were spoofed (I saw a Strange Tales issues in that movie somewhere). So if you have any amount of pop culture knowledge that goes earlier earlier than the 80's you will find a few inside jokes to giggle at here.

The inside jokes are good for those on the inside, but that's not enough. This film excels in the kind of visual comedy more in line with concepts from Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd. Not that the characters do crazy physical comedy, but a combination of what's happening in the environment and how the characters interact, or not interact, with it shows some comedic polish. The robot probe's ingenuity and love of rocks is just one example among many of this.

The script has it's fun moments and the story seems to follow a more curvy feel to the conflict and emotional devices than your standard ""build up to the climax"" formula. The movie builds up to what looks like the resolution only to have another wrinkle in our hero's plans put them back to square one. It's a little bit refreshing on one way, but in another it feels like the movie kind of keeps trudging forward. Thankfully there is some decent character development throughout this. Nothing groundbreaking. It's not even different than most your standard animated movie plot lines. Still it moves the emotional aspects forward.

I'm not sure why some people are harping about the computer animation being inferior. That's nowhere near the truth. I guess people expect computer animated movies to look as real as possible and ignore the artistic possibilities. Planet 51 is a cartoon. It's not supposed to look photo-realistic. It DOES look great. And one thing I noticed that stood out as especially cool was how they handled smoke effects. It's not Avatar real, but it's a lot more dynamic and believable than what I normally see.

The voice acting surprised me and impressed me. Dwayne Johnson, AKA The Rock, has done comedies with some success before. The thing is he was still The Rock being funny. On Planet 51 not only is he funny, but if you didn't know who was doing the voice work you likely wouldn't have known it was him. Raising the pitch of his voice is what did it. Who's idea what that? His. I'm impressed. Not because he just raised his pitch, but because he created a fun and snarky character in the process. Other voice actors are spot on. Gary Oldman has always been a favorite of mine, and I had a hard time figuring out who he voiced. And that's a good thing as you don't want the audience to hear the actor, but the character. This is what I felt about the entire cast with John Cleese as the exception, mainly because his voice is so distinctive you don't hire him unless you want THAT voice.

The DVD has an impressive array of special features that do better than many blockbusters do on their single disk releases. Here is the breakdown:

Run Rover Run! Obstacle Course Game - Didn't play it, but I hear it's your basic DVD game with jumping and a little whack-a-mole action.

Extended Scenes - Just as it sounds it's extended footage of scenes in the movie. These are fully realized scenes that are fully rendered and produced. They are brief but fun to watch. I just wished they would have just made an extended cut of the movie and added the scenes in as I only see them as a benefit to the movie.

The World of Planet 51 - This is just a short tour of the various CG sets in the movie. Gives you a chance to look at all the little details in various rooms and outdoor settings. Not great, but not bad either.

Life on Planet 51 - This is a relatively short, but very nice documentary on the making of the movie. You get interviews with the voice actors, director and production staff as well as behind the scenes footage on how they made the movie. It's a very well rounded featurette that does a lot more than just give lip service to the viewer. Many times the ""making of"" featurette is nothing more than an advertisement released prior to the movie that doesn't tell you anything. None of that here.

Planetarium: The Voice Stars of Planet 51 - This featurette is inferior to Life on Planet 51, as the previous one already gave you the best parts of this one. There are maybe a little bit of extra snippets on this one that weren't covered on ""Life"", but for the most part you are getting a rehash of what you already seen.

Planet 51 Music Video Montage - Music video using clips of the movie. Nothing more.

Animation Progression Reels - Now this is fun. You get to see different scenes production process by seeing four simultaneous frames of the same scene. One frame is the story board. One is essentially the CG storyboard (for early conceptualization, framing, facing and all that). One frame is essentially the characters and other major components fully rendered, but lacking shading, background details, effects and such. And of course the final version. It's neat to see the process, although I couldn't go through all of the scenes without getting a little bored. I suggest picking the scenes you want to see processed because they have quite a few in this feature.

Planet 51 is a fun movie with a good deal of heart. The production is solid with good animation and effects, great voice acting, and a solid script. You gotta take the movie for what it is: a nod to Cold War sensibilities and the pop culture that arose from it. If you think you can get into a little nostalgia then you will love this movie. Most sci-fi fans that appreciate the classics will love it too. Those of you not into all that, but like visual comedy (sight gags, prat falls, etc) will also get into Planet 51. And ultimately if like films like Shrek, Hoodwinked, and Aliens vs Monsters you will definitely enjoy this little gem.",1271376000,,7423,4.533233756534727
3758490,2,B001PR0YEE,"This movie was nothing special, which is too bad because it had such a great premise. I thought they could've done a lot more with the human/alien role reversal. I caught a few of the throwbacks such as Star Wars and E.T., but it wasn't enough to carry the movie.

Kind of slow, and (maybe it's just me) there seemed to be awkward pauses during some of the dialogue, like they should have taken out a second or half second of silence between lines in the conversations.

I thought the general was waaaaay too one-dimensional. He had no thought process, and was practically a zombie prior to the astronaut's arrival.

The premise is simple enough, a US astronaut lands on a planet inhabited by green, humanoid life forms that are living in a society reminescent of 1950's America.  The ""natives"" think the astronaut is a threat and try to catch him.  Some of the locals believe otherwise and help him escape.

With a budget of $70 million, despite heavy competition from Hollywood blockbusters ""New Moon"" and ""2012"", ""Planet 51"" earned $94 million worldwide.

VIDEO:

""Planet 51"" looks very good when it comes to details. Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1),  I enjoyed the overall atmosphere created by Ilion Animation Studios.  From the creation of the homes, the gates, the plants, the skies...the whole '50s feel of the town looks quite vibrant and beautiful.  But when it comes to the green citizens, there is much less detail.  Although green, even Shrek is green but you can still see the spots within its skin.  Not so much for the aliens of ""Planet 51"", although a lot of detail can be seen in the astronaut uniform of Chuck.  But overall, the animation was well-done from Ilion Animation Studios and the presentation is absolutely vibrant in HD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Planet 51"" features audio in English and German 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Also, an English audio description track in 5.1 Dolby Digital is included.  Because the film incorporates many action scenes, from the sound of the vehicles zipping through the air, Chuck's spacecraft with its engine roaring or the hidden base opening up, there is good use of the surround channels and LFE.  Dialogue and music are also clear and understandable through the center and front channels.  But overall, a pretty solid lossless soundtrack!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, German and Turkish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Planet 51"" is a fun and entertaining sci-fi film.  Although, the cold war reference, especially dealing with the fear of aliens may go over the heads of children, ""Planet 51"" manages to be a film similar to E.T. but in this case, the human is the alien and for the most part, the green aliens speak perfect English. Also, the film does a good job for paying homage to various sci-fi films such as ""Alien"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", ""Terminator"", etc.  If anything, the humor of the cold war, especially classic and current sci-fi films will easily make fans of the genre quite appreciate of the film.

While, the human ""Chuck"" is more of a guy that is all talk and makes himself out as a guy who has ""the right stuff"", Lem has been the alien guy who really never stood for himself and has had his share of low self-esteem.  Through helping Chuck and overcoming a variety of obstacles, we see how Lem begins to feel more comfortable with himself and eventually, using his new-found self-esteem to get closer to his dream girl Neera.

Despite the film not receiving the greatest reviews, ""Planet 51' is a CG-animated film that may not have any deep overtones but there is really cool CG animation when it comes to the actual living areas.  The detail is quite beautiful on Blu-ray and the lossless soundtrack is quite awesome as well.  The Blu-ray has a good number of special features as well.  And if you are a parent looking for a fun and safe film for the kids while going on a trip, the Blu-ray release does include a DVD and also a digital copy as well.

Overall, ""Planet 51"" is a good movie and I think those who are able to pick up on the jokes of the film will enjoy some of its slapstick humor.  The film has enough gags to please the children (as my seven year old who watched it in the theater and once again with me on Blu-ray was giggling throughout) but anyone expecting anything more or anything deep may be disappointed. But in the end, I was quite satisfied with the film overall.",1268179200,,5054,4.718857142857143
3758522,3,B001PR0YEE,"I had stayed away from this movie because of all the negative reviews, but my husband persuaded me to give it a try since it was playing at the dollar theater. We also brought our 5-year-old daughter along, thinking this was going to be a kids' movie. Well, though our daughter was entertained, I think this movie is best appreciated by adults who can grasp all of the pop culture references, especially those 50s sci-fi flicks. If you fall into this latter category, chances are you'll be entertained, as my husband and I (both movie buffs) were. The visuals are bright and colorful, and serve to keep kids' interest.

The story itself is a kind of twist - instead of human being invaded by aliens (as was so typical of 50s sci-fi flicks), here we have an alien culture who are terrified of a human astronaut who inadvertently lands on their planet. The entire planet is populated by a race of green creatures with antennaes, and they all embrace the music of the 50s, read 50s comics, and generally live out the era. Chuck the astronaut's (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) arrival is greeted with horror as these green guys have come to perceive those not of their planet as humanoids, and it falls upon hapless teenager Lem (Justin Long), his best friend Skiff (Seann William Scott) and the girl of Lem's dreams, Neera (Jessica Biel) to 'rescue' Chuck. The baddies here are played by General Grawl (Gary Oldman) and mad scientist Kipple (a hammy John Cleese). When the story lags, it uses Chuck's cute robot dog Rover for gags. The movie references lots of classic movies such as Star Wars, Singing in the Rain, E.T., etc. which though hardly original makes it fun and entertaining.",1266278400,13,1679,4.691525423728813
3758523,5,B001PR0YEE,"'Planet 51' was the last thing showing at our local theatre that I hadn't already seen.  The previews and lobby displays (mis)led me to believe it was just another throwaway kids' cartoon, full of forced cuteness, predictable gags, and cardboard characters; but I had time to kill and the ticket was at matinee price, so I finally went in.  Am I ever glad I did!

The obvious send-up of 1950s American culture is fun, and so is the shoe-on-the-other-foot twist of the human being viewed as the fearful alien menace, but if that's all a viewer takes away, he or she is missing a lot.  There was plenty of unexpected satire that had me laughing out loud through much of the film.  There is also a profound message that centering one's society around perpetual fear can cause more harm to a culture's core values than the thing being feared; however, the message very carefully doesn't get in the way of the humanity (alienity?) of the story.

The music was well done and really enhanced the fun.  Visually, I loved the film.  Character design wasn't anything particularly special, but the look of the planet itself was gorgeous.  This is a cartoon, after all, not an overblown CGI extravanganza like Avatar, so you shouldn't expect photorealistic rendering of every tiny detail.  The beauty of this kind of artwork is in the imaginative forms and colors, the simplicity of shapes and lines that enhance the story, not overwhelm it.

Actually, having brought the subject up, I suppose many comparisons and contrasts could be drawn that make Planet 51 a kind of Anti-Avatar.  Here, the humans are neither conquering villains, nor paternalistic hero figures.  People--er, beings--from both sides have to do their part on Planet 51 to bridge the misunderstanding of cultures and enable goodwill to prevail.  That may not be the kind of dramatic plot it takes to engage some viewers' attention these days, yet it's exactly the sort of solid but gentle storytelling one should expect from the offspring of George Harrison's Handmade Films.

Plus, so far as I can tell, no one has yet suffered depression after viewing Planet 51. :)",1265500800,95,2123,4.858333333333333

3758526,4,B001PR0YEE,"I really liked this movie. It had an awesome storyline. I loved that it was set during the 1950's on Planet 51, but is modern day on Earth, because I really enjoy 50's pop culture. Lem is an 'alien' who thinks that the Galaxy is only 500 miles long. On a typical day, an astronaut named Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Baker lands on the planet and thinks he's the first, but he was dead wrong. All the residents believe Chuck is an alien who wants to eat their brains and turn them into zombies. Lem befriends Chuck and finds out that he's a good guy. The military take over Chuck's ship so they can dissect it. If Chuck doesn't get back to his ship in time, he will never be able to return to Earth. I highly recommend PLANET 51!!!",1264636800,7,725,4.223021582733813
3758527,1,B001PR0YEE,"I took my 8year old and friend to see this.  It was hard to sit through the entire movie.

It was:

1.  Boring
2.  Not funny - very few laugh out loud moments
2.  References to subject matter way over a child's head
3.  A couple of inappropriate references

I will not be buying this movie...ever.",1263600000,9,297,4.178571428571429
3758528,4,B001PR0YEE,"This film was very enjoyable if you know the references to the 1950s films along with other scifi films; being a cinema major and music junkie I knew majority of the films that were parodied making it extremely funny. However 99% of the people (including critics [Which are usually film school drop outs always bitter]) didn't get the references and made it less enjoyable for them. The reason why the film didn't do good was that it was released during the same weekend as New Moon (UHF did the same with Indiana Jones 3) and was too specific of a market. It's a great film if you've seen all those cheesy films but not for kids. The film was made for them but kids won't get this however mom and dad would find it to their enjoyment. For adults think of it as a kids film but with clean jokes for you. John Cleese from Monty Python is in there along with the ""Rock"" as the astronaut which both have perfect roles. The music had lots of remade hits from the 1950s. So before you watch it make sure you know lots of the films and music otherwise you may not be able to appreciate the film for what's there. It's definitely a film to kick back with a beer and some of your friends who are into the retro films to get a good laugh from. Highly underrated since most people didn't understand it.",1262908800,46,1292,4.277551020408163
3758529,4,B001PR0YEE,"Plot: A human lands on a Planet (assumed to be called 51) thinking it is just another moon, only to find out it is inhabited by human fearing aliens who think the humans want to eat them. Hence, mayhem ensues as they attempt to track down said astronaut who has befriended a young local he convinces to aid him.

Nice little movie, good jokes and fun to be had. Like the other reviewer said nothing ground breaking but a great time for most age groups. Pretty fun turn of the tables with the human being the alien (yeah kind of an ET in reverse, but cool none the less).",1262131200,4,570,4.229357798165138
3758530,2,B001PR0YEE,"Me and my gf watched this movie with a good amount of expectations. We expected:

1. Great animation work. CHECK! But nothing marvelous or extraordinary. Nothing that differentiates this film from many other animations.

2. A good, complex, well-thought-out plot that would fascinate us, something unimaginable. UNCHECK! This movie is extremely predictable from beginning to end, it has no twist. I was able to predict this film's plot and storyline pretty much throughout the movie. It has a very simplistic formula based plot that has been used dozens and dozens of time over and over again. Lets see if you guys can see.

3. Good, witty humor. UNCHECK. The humor is there and it does make you laugh sometimes, but nothing that'll make you laugh hard unless you're a person that's easily amused and laughs when you see everyone around you laugh aka a puppet. Most of the jokes are very plain, obviously meant for kids or very simple minded adults.

All in all, this movie is boring, predictable, and something I've seen before, just a bit retouched here and there.

Me and my gf really wanted to watch an enjoyable movie since we both watch all types of movies, even animations and Japanese anime, but this movie is just uninspiring and uninteresting. We wanted something new and exciting. Unfortunately, this movie lacks a lot. There's more to movies than just decent animation and directing, it's all in the story.",1261785600,8,1418,4.891666666666667

There are some great references to other films that small kids won't get but still it has a good story, great animation and refreshing humor (no way this was made in the united states) that they will enjoy. I especially liked how the knee-jerk reaction of the government is mocked. Pretty cool film.",1260921600,6,429,4.584415584415584
