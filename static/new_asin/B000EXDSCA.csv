2543020,5,B000EXDSCA,"After KING KONG I suppose there was really nothing great from Hollywood's Golden Era to bring out on DVD except for this, the Mount Everest of 60s film musicals.  And soon, June 13, right in time for summer, we will be able to feast our eyes at last on the most addictive cinematic treat ever made.  I know there are some who say it's the worst movie ever made, and I used to be in that party as well.  But every time I watch it now, and it's always on AMC, I have new respect for the makers of the film, especially director Mark Robson, who really is trying to bring life and reality into a somewhat bizarre script.  Robson has plenty of prestige credits to his name; he started working with Val Lewton and then climbed out of B-movies with the noir explosion of the late 40s, when right in a row he knocked out CHAMPION, ROUGHSHOD, and HOME OF THE BRAVE.  Something of the raw power of these films clings to VALLEY's frilly edges; not just in the over the top voyage of Neely O'Hara down to the alleys of San Francisco's North Beach, where she staggers from bar to bar looking for a jukebox to play one of her bygone hits.  ""I used to be Neely O'Hara!""  Now, if Brando had said that, everyone would have believed it, but Patty Duke, perhaps she was a little too young to be playing the part.  Anyhow the San Francisco of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS has long gone now, and the alleys and flea-bag hotels where Neely shacks up with any stranger have been replaced by expensive, sterile boutique tourist hotels, and yet we can still identify with her panicked sense that the world has gone by a little too fast for comfort.  We all wake up and wonder what hit us, what happened, where did it all start going wrong?

Mark Robson was Canadian and could view American problems with a gimlet eye, an inherently cinematic one at that.  Audiences shrief with pleasure at the montage sequences of VALLEY, like the one where Neely exercises frantically in a series of improbably gym outfits, while learning musical numbers and berating Martin Milner in between.  The truth is, we are exhilarated by Robson's mastery of one of the cinema's oldest tricks, fast motion to make life seem more precious and magical.  Melies perfected it; Robson just brings it to life once again with that incredibly earnest Andre Previn soundtrack.

So, about Patty Duke I'm of two minds, but basically, when I see the show now I am always impressed by how totally she gives herself to the role, even if she can't always stretch her talent all the way across its other side.  Her wisecracks and her ""sexiness"" are tasteless, but her singing voice is ebullient, filled with life, fun, you can imagine, yes, she might have been a Broadway star.  She's so short though that occasionally you catch the set designers rearranging chairs (giving them longer legs, etc) to make her look less like a little girl and more like a mini-Bardot.

She still brings me to tears every time she's in the sanitarium and Tony's there and she has the inspired idea to sing ""Come Live with Me"" directly to him and somehow he remembers who he is for a minute and manages to croak out a few bars.  It doesn't seem like something the thoughtless Neely would do, but we forget, she's basically good at heart, she's just been hurt too early in life.

Anne Welles (Barbara Parkins) has another fantastic montage, when she becomes the Gillian girl on TV and they dress her in dozens of colorful caftans and mini-dresses while the backgrounds shift from one psychedelic light-show-based blob to the next.  She maintains her Canadian cool throughout.  I only really love Anne when she gets herself concerned about poor Jennifer.

Jennifer North (Sharon Tate) is exquisite in every scene.  There is no question in my mind that she should have won the Oscar for playing in VALLEY.  People shrugged and said, she can't act.  That's true, but only in a very limited way.  Mark Robson had the patience of a saint and really helped Sharon overcome her natural shyness and false self-consciousness.  The scenes where she has to act in a trailer for a French ""nudey"" movie, while at the same time, she's watching the trailer in disgust, are awesome, and how about when she and Tony are leaving Lincoln Center and he falters, then collapses.  I've heard from several sources that Robson filmed the scene without telling Sharon Tate that Tony was going to fall down, thus capturing what looks like honest surprise and consternation and worry.  Perhaps the DVD will show the screen tests that Jean Seberg did for ""Jennifer.""  THAT would be a coup!

All this and ""I'll Plant My Own Tree,"" ""Give a Little More,"" and that world beating swinging love song, ""It's Impossible.""

And George Jessel.

2543021,1,B000EXDSCA,"I have to agree with Reviewer #1, this is one of the worst movies ever made; and yet, like a 30-car pile up on the freeway, it's impossible not to watch.  WAY over the top performances by Patty Duke, Susan Hayward, Lee Grant (and just about everyone else), eerie, rare appearance by Sharon Tate, great title song sung by Dionne Warwicke, wild sixties fashions, cheesy dialogue (my favorite:  ""There's only one star of a Helen Lawson show and that's ME, Helen Lawson, remember?"") - it's all here.  I can't wait to own it on DVD.",1142467200,15,527,4.526315789473684
2543022,4,B000EXDSCA,"OH MY GOD!  One of the all time worst films that is FUN to watch had finally come to DVD.  This is a classic! Please remember that the novel by Jaqueline Susann is (or was) the top selling fiction book of all time. The translation to film did not work.  Script, acting, directing - all is terrible & cheezy but somehow the film is kinda fun.  Maybe because it is about Hollywood! You get to watch some great stars in some embarrassing awful situations/acting.  Have Fun. You may want to rent it first to see if it is your cup of tea, but I am definitely adding it to my already large DVD collection!",1142380800,7,599,4.219298245614035
2543023,4,B000EXDSCA,"When I read the reviews of this film in books, most critics either rated it as a ""BOMB"", ""TURKEY"", or ""IT""S SO BAD IT'S FUNNY"". It made me wary of it, until I realized that it featured the late Sharon Tate.

I actually enjoyed watching this movie (although it is slow and ludicrous in some parts). I loved the scene between Susan Hayward's Helen Lawson and Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara involving the wig and the lavatory - it's not to be missed! - ""What are you doing?"" Hayward's bitchy Helen Lawson demands. ""Giving it a shampoo! Goodbye, pussycat - meow!!"", Patty Duke's screechy but hilarious Neely O'Hara responds gleefully. When it fails to flush, she throws over her shoulder, ""Well, how do you like that? It wouldn't even go down the john!"" And then she tosses the drowned rat rug over the stall door. What a riot!

I also liked Dionne Warwick's ""Valley of the Dolls"" theme song, in fact, it has been featured on several websites as part of a memorial to Sharon Tate. Speaking of the gorgeous Miss Tate, she is one of the main reasons to watch this film. Her mesmerizing and enchanting beauty, her touching vulnerability and honest portrayal of the tragic, ill-fated Jennifer is one of the highlights - too bad she doesn't have more screen time. But the coincidences between her and this role are too much to dismiss. Her body being used in films, her beauty exploited, her sweet personality, her star-crossed romance with Tony Polar (Tony Scotti - what a mouth, dentists would love him), her pregnancy, which she aborts, and her suicide, which is a real tear-jerker for me, only adds poignancy to her real life. It is hard to see her and not think of the horrible fate that awaited her and her unborn child just two years later. I think she would have done very well as an actress.

Patty Duke and Barbara Parkins (a fellow Canadian) have their notable parts too, but Neely becomes so whiny and self-centered you have to wonder why Anne Welles and Lyon Burke (Paul Burke) even continue to maintain a friendship with her. The same can be said for the men in her life - Mel(Martin Milner)and Ted Casablanca (Alexander Davion).

And that song, ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" has got to go! Who came up with that stained plastic mobile that slowly twirls in the background during this ridiculous number? It's amazing that Hayward wasn't knocked unconscious by the excruciating lyrics, the appalling plastic, or both!!

The song ""Come Live With Me"" actually isn't bad, although it sounds better when Neely and Tony sing it together in the sanitarium. I love those 60s fashions (the Gillian Girl commercial is a real hoot), music and references, although some of it is very dated and slightly offensive, with references to 'fags'. The character of Anne is sympathetic, and it's nice to see her wake up and come to her senses. Most of the male actors are overwhelmed by the strong women they are with. Lee Grant as Tony's controlling sister Miriam comes off very well. Susan Hayward is priceless as the over the top Helen Lawson. Some of the novel's trashier themes are not mentioned or lightly glossed over, so it makes an interesting comparison, and also with the 1980s remake.

Don't miss this 1967 version of ""VALLEY OF THE DOLLS""! You won't regret it. It can be a tad slow, but it's worth it! You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll agree that it's priceless!",1141171200,2,3349,4.667796610169492
2543024,5,B000EXDSCA,"Jacqueline Susann had little literary style--but she did have first-hand knowledge of both Hollywood and Broadway, and she based her 1966 novel on the lives of several highly regarded performers, including Judy Garland, Ethel Merman, and Betty Hutton.  Her plot points were melodramatic, but they were unexpectedly brutal for the time, and the sordid, puerile, and gritty details with which she endowed the book struck a nerve with readers who had never really believed all those press releases about how stars were ""just folks.""  The critics despised it, but VALLEY OF THE DOLLS rocketed to the top of the best seller lists, an international publishing phenomena and the single best selling novel of the 20th century.  The highly anticipated 1967 film version was expected to be equally groundbreaking.

It wasn't, and the reviews were justly savage.  The book's fame carried it to undeserved financial success, but when the theatrical run ended it went into the vault.  There it stayed until the 1970s when--possibly prompted by Sharon Tate's horrific death--CBS picked it up to fill an empty late-night-movie slot.  Having acquired the rights, the network ran it repeatedly over the next few years.  Little by little, audiences began to tune in... and their jaws dropped with a ""What were they thinking?"" incredulity.  This revival was not necessarily welcomed by those associated with the film.  Oscar-winner Patti Duke had conquered television and even become something of a teen idol, releasing several successful pop recordings, but by the mid-1960s she was in need of a role to blow off the trappings of her juvenile years.  The part of alcoholic, pill-popping Neely O'Hara seemed ideal, but the film was a critical nightmare and Duke bore the brunt of the attack.  Although she continued to work on stage and television, she strongly felt the film ended her bid for major movie stardom and was quite vocal in her rejection of it.

The basic story concerns three young women in New York who, either by accident or design, work in show business.  Anne Wells (Barbara Parkins) is a prim and proper young lady from New England who takes a secretarial job with a talent agent; she soon falls in love with boss Lyon Burke (a horrifically miscast Paul Burke) and is later launched to fame as a television commercial model.  Neely O'Hara (Patti Duke) is a ""born in a trunk"" type show-biz kid whose first shot at stardom is yanked from under her by vicious star Helen Lawson (Susan Hayward)--but her talent wins through, and she becomes Hollywood's  hottest star.  Jennifer North (Sharon Tate) is a show girl whose talent is her body, and who falls in love with lounge singer Tony Polar (the truly dire Tony Scotti) against his sister Miriam's (Lee Grant) wishes.  Along the way there are also womanizing husbands, possibly gay husbands, mysterious genetic diseases, asylums, abortions, cat fights, skinflicks, cancer, suicide, and enough booze and dope to float a battleship.  There is also a lot of bad dialogue, bizarre musical numbers, treacherous necklaces, wayward shoe buckles, montage sequences that look like cheap Vogue layouts, peculiar fashions, atrocious hairstyles, and performances that alternate between bland understatement and operatic hysteria.

As in most cases, the fundamental disaster begins with the script.  The novel was what you might call honestly trashy and consequently quite compelling, but the screenwriters were afraid of the material.  They are willing to mention abortion, but there aren't actually any scenes that pertain to it.  They will talk about gay men--always using such terms as ""fag"" and ""queer""--but they draw the line at having gay characters on screen.  When Anne succumbs to her lover's supposed carnal charms she enters the room discreetly wrapped in a big bath towel and there is fade out at the kiss.  The porno film that Jennifer makes to pay her husband's hospital bills is tame even by 1967 standards.  And then there are the lines, so wildly ridiculous that you wonder how any actor could say them and keep a straight face.  But it really director Mark Robson who stamps the whole thing with a cult-film kiss.

Mark Robson was best known for the film PEYTON PLACE, and his success with that film in 1957 would be a major factor in the failure of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in 1967.  For this is not really a 1960s film.  Oh yes, the performers, the clothing, the sets, even the references to everything from abortion to suicide are distinctly 1960s, but it is all done with a 1950s sensibility.  From kisses to pill-popping, the attitudes are naive and the approach is incredibly chaste, and there is a tremendous clash between the material and the way in which it is presented; seen today, it can only be described as double-retro.

If Robson had no real feel for the material, he also lacked empathy for his cast.  By most accounts Robson was determinedly combative in dealing with Patti Duke.  Some feel this was actually a directorial maneuver, an orchestrated ill-will designed to bring Duke to the emotional boil the role required--but whatever the case the result was not so much emotional boil as a boiler explosion.  Duke plays at a white-hot level from start to finish; everything goes from very big to even bigger, and she looks ridiculous as a result.  But Duke is not alone in her one-note performance, for Robson seems to have inflicted this upon every one in the cast.

Barbara Parkins, a remarkably beautiful woman with a memorable speaking voice, spends most of the film giving doe-eyed gazes to Paul Burke, and since Burke is only mildly attractive and utterly uncharismatic the effect is ludicrous.  Parkins is also saddled with all the ""good girl"" lines, most of which begin with ""But Lyon,"" or ""Oh, Neely,"" and when she at last succumbs to drugs the best Robson can come up with for her is a stumble down the beach and a wallow at the shore.  Sharon Tate was a memorable beauty but not a gifted actress; it is therefore odd that of the three leads she is most successful--but this is really only comparative.  Like every one else, she is saddled with atrocious dialogue and ridiculous scenes, and she has the added liability of Tony Scotti as a leading man; even so, her natural warmth somehow manages to read through.  Of the entire cast, only two emerge relatively unscathed: Susan Hayward and Lee Grant.  It is perhaps significant that both built careers on playing ""tough broads,"" and their roles here are essentially repetitions of well-worn paths expertly traveled.  Even so, Hayward has the film's single most ludicrous musical number, and Grant gets blindsided by the film's single worst plot device.

Who could ask for anything more?  Well, a really good print, really good sound, and lots of extras would be nice--and this double DVD ""Special Edition"" release provides them all.  It restores all the scenes that were usually clipped for television; it also offers a pristine print and the sound quality is excellent.  Unfortunately, Garland's screen tests and film work has still not surfaced, and while Patti Duke says she has come to terms with and even embraces the film's popularity it would seem that embrace does not extend to significant interviews on the subject.  But this aside, the bonus material is quite good.

Barbara Parkins and E! commentator Ted Casablanca (not to be confused with the character of the same name in the film) share duties on the commentary track, and while Casablanca is a bit wearing, Parkins is charming and often wickedly subtle: throughout the commentary she puts Casablanca in his place more than once, demonstrates remarkable cleverness in dodging things she clearly has no wish to discuss, and often allows her silence to speak louder than words.  This is particularly true concerning her personal relationships with Lee Grant and Patti Duke; the former is dismissed in a phrase and, while she backs Duke in her claims of Robson's abuse, she also avoids comment on Duke as a personality--at least until the very end, when a certain ire breaks through.  At the same time, she is remarkably forthcoming on the subjects of Judy Garland and Sharon Tate, and lends considerable insight into both.

There are a number of archival bits, some specifically pertaining to author Jacqueline Susann, some concerning the ""nautical"" premier of the film.  These are interesting, but they show their age.  More interesting are the contemporary documentaries, most of which address the cult appeal of the film and which include numerous interviews with a wide range of individuals.  It may not be the perfect bonus package, but it comes close enough.

Clearly VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is a film that has a limited appeal, but if you are a fan, and lots of people are, throw out your old VHS and spring for the DVD.  It may be trash, but it's fabulous trash, and it's worth it.

2543025,4,B000EXDSCA,"This film is so spectacularly bad and contains some of the most campy dialogue ever committed to film that it is hard to believe that the Parties involved thought this would be considered a serious piece of ""Art."" I do give the Actors credit for not laughing at some of the ridiculous lines they have to say. When Sharon Tate reminds Patty Duke ""how bitchy fags can be"" somehow Ms. Duke doesn't start laughing. Even better is when Ms Tate learns that her husband has a disease that will make him a ""Veg-e-table"" and when the Doctor asks if she has any questions she says No ! As for Ms. Parkins, she doesn't do a whole lot other than pose and speak beautifully. Patty Duke screams, cries, shimmies, and flushes wigs down the toilet - bascially everything but spin her head around al la ""The Exorcist"" although I was waiting for that too. It was a career defining - and nearly career-killing performance that she described as ""humiliating"" in her 1988 memoir - but she has since embraced the film (something Faye Dunaway sadly has not done with ""Mommie Dearest."")Susan Hayward, as boozy broad Helen Lawson, veers toward self-parody in most of her scenes but she delivers one of the best-known camp lines in history (Which one? Watch and see). Like the before-mentioned ""Mommie Dearest,"" this gem is best seen with some cocktails, a room full of Gay men, and some ""dolls"" to calm down the resulting laughter. The DVD special features, particularly on Disc 2, are great. I had no idea that this was made into a TV Miniseries in 1981 with no-talent Lisa Hartman, of all people, cast as Neeley, but the documentary includes scenes of that as well.

2543173,4,B000EXDSCA,"Released in 1967 and based on Jacqueline Susanns novel, Valley of the Dolls is a soap opera about the negative side of showbiz in the mid-60s. Barbara Parkins stars as the ing&eacute;nue from small town New England who moves to New York City and swiftly lands a job as a secretary at theatrical agency that represents an arrogant, aging performer (Susan Hayward). Paul Burke plays the suave agency son who takes interest in her while Patty Duke appears as a feisty, talented upstart, the rival of Haywards character. Sharon Tate plays a statuesque beauty with limited acting aptitude while the sharp Lee Grant and stud-ly Tony Scotti play a sister/brother team. The three main protagonists eventually resort to prescription drugs to relieve their stress, particularly the barbiturates Seconal & Nembutal and various stimulants, which are the eponymous dolls.

The first 25 minutes are great, showcasing wintery New England landscapes and several curvy beauties in the Broadway scene. You cant beat the authentic mid-60s ambiance reflected in everything and everyone. From there, however, the movie settles into a salacious cautionary tale that relies on sentimental twaddle and hints of steamy sex to compensate for a relatively un-compelling story. Fans of soap operas will no doubt enjoy it more than I did.

People criticize the movie on the grounds that its campy, but this is inaccurate. Valley is a totally serious (melo)drama with the occasional overacted histrionics, but its not campy. If you want camp, see the non-sequel Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), which is a satire scripted by none other than Roger Ebert.

In an interview Patty Duke said that director Mark Robson treated the female actors like unintelligent bimbos, particularly Sharon Tate. Interestingly, Judy Garland was originally slated to play the roll played by Hayward, but Robson fired Garland for ironically turning up drunk. Duke also said she and her pals would occasionally order pizza and have a ""Valley of the Dolls night where theyd make fun of the movie. Sadly, Sharon Tate would be dead less than two years after the films release, murdered by the Manson wackos in Los Angeles on August 9, 1969.

The movie drives home its message well:  Beauty is fleeting, money does not bring true happiness, drugs & drink are a dead end and showbiz fame can be a bitter pill; but one CAN escape if one chooses. I also like how the movie switches from New York City to California at the midway point, which keeps things fresh. Lastly, the entertaining bathroom catfight between Hayward and Duke is worth the price of admission.

The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Redding Center & New Haven, Connecticut; Manhattan & Katonah, New York; and Santa Monica, Malibu & Los Angeles, California.

For those who thought Mad Men was over the top in the sexism and other -isms...this should prove. Not.
Amazing to realize Patty Duke went from being a ""perky"" teen to the next year a rising star/addicted star.
And Susan Hayward's line about Broadway and dope, and ""I've got a MAN waiting for me"" has been recycled often including currently on Stephanie Miller's comedy/political radio show.

2543284,5,B000EXDSCA,"I saw Valley of the Dolls when it fist came out and I was about 17. Before that, the book was read, hidden and talked about between the girls I knew in high school. It was also the talk of the media and the upper middle class burgs in California and Jacqueline Susann did the talk show rounds. The movie didn't live up to expectations from what I've read since but I liked it from the first with its perspective from a female aspect it was fresh and interesting to me. The soundtrack by Dory and Andre Previn works some king of magic for the movie unlike soundtracks for today's films that are theme less Muzak clips. Dionne Warwick's vocal in the title track is superb in haunting the storyline. I enjoy watching the movie just to see Barbara Parkins especially in the first half of the movie, she set the high bar for beauty and the unobtainably perfect woman for me, I fell in love with her and 35 years later I still am. Patty Duke has no problem role playing Neely O'Hara and the wild twists of emotion. Sharon Tate clearly was headed for an even more stellar career as the quiet, humble super beauty bombshell, but her life was taken shortly after finishing the film by the subhuman monster ""Manson Family"" members (can we please turn back the calendar?). The performances of the male actors becomes more impressive each time I watch it as there is so much drama surrounding the women that the men are easily overlooked. I REALLY love the cinematography, the camera angles, the lighting and the sets that are a classic '60s style, enhancing the visual emotion just to the limit of extreme. I know it's considered camp to me in the '60s at all. What a good production overall, except for the hairspray commercial scene, it's never a bore to watch unlike far too many movies of this decade that are boring within 10 minutes!",1457222400,2,1828,4.4924924924924925

2543436,5,B000EXDSCA,"Really, just about everything else that the late Jacqueline Susann wrote ranked with those chintzy books with floral arrangements on the cover. But back in the mid-1960s, all everyone talked about was this one book. It was like ""Valley"" was the new ""Gone With the Wind"". So much that there just HAD to be a movie. So they recruited Barbara Parkins fresh from her starring TV role opposite Mia Farrow and Ryan O'Neal in the very first prime time soap ""Peyton Place"", teen star Patty Duke fresh from playing twin-cousins in her own sitcom. Then finally they had to get a stacked-like-a-brick-outhouse blonde in Sharon Tate, doomed to later becoming the evil icon Charlie Manson's most famous victim. It could have been an overpriced over-produced disaster, but it wasn't--it copped just about every Oscar in sight in a sweep that rivaled ""West Side Story"" a few years earlier.

The premise was very simple--icy regal small-town New England beauty (Parkins as Anne Welles) moves to the Big City and lands a job in the front office of a talent agency. Her downstairs neighbor is this cute-kid working-class roots Broadway extra (Duke as Neely O'Hara). In the process, Anne also meets and befriends leggy showgirl Jennifer North (Tate). Three BFF's who are as un-alike as you can get, but their diversity is what made that friendship possible--people who are alike often hate each other's guts. They move through the entertainment world separately and together, ensnared by the fame, the alcoholism and barbiturate addiction which are as much a part of the pop entertainment landscape as the curtains and the footlights. But Neely's battle with mental illness aggravated by the booze and pills (which partially paralleled similar issues in Patty Duke's offstage life) caused me some real anguish at the time, because Duke had been one of my ""star crushes"" in my teens. One of my mental ""WAV files"" from this film is Neely having a breakdown, screaming her own name; ""NEELY O'HARA!!!"" Given the fact that my favorite authors are Stephen King and the late Tom Clancy, and my all-time favorite movie series is the James Bond franchise, I guess you could call ""Dolls"" (both the book and this flick) a ""guilty pleasure"" for me.",1403740800,,2217,4.943699731903485
2543437,4,B000EXDSCA,"Some call Valley of the Dolls one of the worst movies ever made.  Acting wise, this is probably true.  Even Patty Duke, a remarkable actress, comes across no better than a drama student in a bad high school play.  We can thank the director (if you can call him this), Mark Robson for so totally alienating the actresses in the film.

Payy Duke hated him for demeaning her in order to ""pull a performace out of her.""  Sharon Tate was treated like an imbecile, which she wasn't, by him and her performance comes across as wooden and staged.  His inability to direct and properly treat one of the most gifted actresses of all time, Judy Garland, resulted in her being replaced by Susan Hayward who overacts all over the place in this film.

Yet there is much to praise this film for.  Breathtaking cinematography in some of the location work, beautiful music that captures the spirit of the film in a way the screenplay and acting could not.  And there are even some touching emotional moments.
The ending is quite good with Ann finally getting away from the drugs, the hollywood scene hypocrisy and the adultery.  She has found herself and is free.

Some of the scenes, however, are just so laughable that one forgets the good qualities of the film.  Patty Duke in that ridiculous costume, as her character Neely gets angry and walks off the set of the movie she is filming.  Neely in the alley screaming, ""I'm Neey Ohara"" is downright embarrassing.  Poor Sharon Tate in the scene where she is on the phone talking to her mother, while she does breast enlargement exercises makes one whince.

Susan Hayward, as the character Helen Lawson, singing ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" is so obviously dubbed that you want to close your eyes in embarrassment for her.  Her contortions of her body while she is singing makes it look like she is having gastrointestional problems and all the while a big ridiculous mobile is swinging around her head.  What in the world was Mark Robson thinking?

Everyone loves Susan Hayward, but this film was just not for her.  Judy Garland could have done wonders with the part if Mark Robson had known how to handle and treat her.

This actually might have been a very meaningful film had it not been so lude and trying to expoit sexual shock power (for the day--it would even be tame for a TV show today.)  This was done instead of meaningful character development.  Subtle acting would have done much for it instead of this amatuer night overacting that Robson employed.

Patty Duke said in an interview that I saw that every once in a while she has her friends over to her house, orders a Pizza, and has a Valley of the Dolls party.  Her ability to laugh at this film, and herself as she appears in it, shows that she is a true professional.

So, if Valley of the Dolls is so bad, why do I frequently pop a bowl of popcorn, dim the lights and have my own Valley of the Dolls Night?  Why am I entertained for the whole two hours of the film?  Why do I feel a catharsis at the end as we see Ann from behind, leaving her lover and fame, walk in silent solitude down the snow covered path in the woods and disappear from sight?

Chronicling the story of three young women - Anne (Barbara Parkins), Neely (Patty Duke) and Jennifer (Sharon Tate) - who each enter show business and pay the price for it (often with ""dolls"" - pills - as a backdrop), Valley of the Dolls was based on the scandalous (for its time) Jacqueline Susann novel ... and in itself became scandalous by just how badly made, badly-acted, and badly-written a film it was.  Yet, on a daytime drama level, there is something mystically watchable about it; something that sucks you in through the lunacy, the overacting, and will soon have you watching it for the tenth or twentieth time, quoting lines and lyrics back to it like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  A train wreck of a film, yet one you can never tire of, or quite turn away from when it comes on cable.  As addicting as ""dolls"" themselves.

2543479,5,B000EXDSCA,"This is the movie version of Jaqueline Susann's Roman a'clef trashy novel, VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. It's not a very good movie, but then again, VALLEY was not a very good book. However, they're both fun.

The best part of the book was trying to figure out who all these characters were supposed to be in real life.

Helen Lawson, a ruthless vulgar stage staras supposed to be Ethel Merman. Neely O'Hara was supposed to be the much-loved superstar Judy Garland.

Jennifer North seemed to be a Hybrid of Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot.

Barbara Parkins character was a mixture of Grace Kelly and ?

The Movie was actually pretty to look at with lavish sets and costumes but, the story was a shrink-to-fit version with many changes and many deletions.

Por Patty Duke won what was at the time, the prize role in this opus, that of Neely. It almost destroyed her career. The girl is supposed to be Judy Garland. There was only one Judy and she had the kind of voice that could break your heart. Casting this role was impossible. The music wasn't bad but it wasn't Garland either. Harold Arlen and others wrote songs FOR Judy. The Previns just weren't up to this task. Judy was also, reportedly, lovable, no matter what else was going on in her life. Patty Duke is just shrill and unpleasant.

Have you ever noticed that in the films final scenes, when Neely is to drunk to go on, her understudy is played by a young woman who is made up to look like Barbra Streisand?

There's another problem. this movie's timeline is all off. The book is set in the late Forties and Fifties (More or less). This movie is all over the place.

Susan Hayward got the best reviews and was in fact, the only one to emerge unscathed. Well, in the first place, beautiful Susan wasn't a homely old bag like...Helen and she had Margaret Whiting dubbing her song ""I'll plant my own tree"".

One reviewer of the day wrote that the best part of the movie was Dionne Warwick singing the Title song. Sad but true.

2543481,1,B000EXDSCA,"This could have been such a great film. The book is wonderful, the movie however just falls flat on it's face. If you haven't read the book then you will have absolutely no idea what is happening in the movie or how any of these characters know each other or how their relationships become intertwined, or even anything about them in general. Also it's absolutely nothing like the book. I understand this movie was made in the late 60's so I'm sure there's no way this film could have been made like it had been written in the book there are lots of things I'm sure they would have to take out or change in order to make it appropriate to be put on the screen, but the things they chose to change were just ridiculous and really took away from the movie and the characters.

I can appreciate a bad movie, but I honestly find nothing redeeming enough about this film to even make it enjoyable to laugh at or keep watching. I barely made it through the whole thing. It's a two hour long movie but so little happens in the movie and at the same time tons of things are going on at once only you don't get to see any of it. It's basically just little flash forwards in every scene that like I said before would leave you lost if you haven't read the book. Very disappointing. I really don't understand how it's become a cult classic, yeah some scenes are pretty to look at but there's nothing there. A great story becomes empty, meaningless, and boring.

Susan Hayward has a memorable yet smaller role, and Shannon Tate plays a role that seems written just for her as the tragic non-actress in this one.

2543501,4,B000EXDSCA,"I love this movie for tons of reasons, most of which are better explained by the other reviewers.  Having said that, an otherwise five star release loses a star due to the lack of footage involving Judy Garland.  While I do not know if Miss Garland actually completed any scenes, I have seen her wardrobe tests for the character of Helen Lawson, which were shown, perfectly restored and with audio, as a post-screening bonus when the restored film was shown at The Egyptian theatre in Hollywood, prior to release on dvd.  The dvd only has bits of it.

Additionally, and more importantly, when the AMC Backstory about the film was originally shown on that channel, the end credits rolled to Garland's recording of ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"", which has circulated for years as a bootleg with very poor audio.  Again, this track had been restored and not only sounded exceptionally clear, Judy's vocal had even lost a good deal of the hoarse quality exhibited on the bootleg, where she sounds unwell.  Why wasn't it included?  For certain fans this alone would justify purchase.

As a soundtrack side note, while Susan Hayward's vocal for ""...Tree"" is dubbed by Margaret Whiting on the film, the soundtrack lp and subsequent cd contain a version by an uncredited vocalist.  This may have been contractual, because at the time Whiting was recording for London Records, while the soundtrack was issued on 20th's own label.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valley-Of-The-Dolls-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0000041OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valley Of The Dolls: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>.

Incidentally people involved with the film have claimed Miss Garland stole the costumes made for her by Travilla , but during a print interview given after she was fired she receives a call from the designer, who gives them to her.  He then had them remade for Susan Hayward.  This makes sense in light of Garland's petite stature (4'11""); who else would they have fit?  She later wore the beaded suit for her 1967 New York Palace Theatre performances, which have as yet not been issued on cd.

2543528,5,B000EXDSCA,"Valley of the Dolls is one of those movies you either get and end up obsessively loving, or don't get and end up thinking it's a big ol' bore. I understand why some people don't like it. One has to have an affinity for the ""so bad it's good"" genre of film to love this. If you have no such affinity, you will not like this movie. If you know this about yourself, don't waste your time.

It is fairly common knowledge that the book which the film is based upon on was insanely popular. I've read it and yes, it's a decent read but it wasn't popular because it was great literature. Jackie Susann was not Tolstoy, but she knew how to write about sex and pretty people with problems. The subject matter was also rather risque for the time period which made it that much more popular. Naturally, the rights were sold to Fox because it is the law that every popular book be adapted for the screen. That's where the problems started. In the 1960s, sex and other other naughty subjects just weren't dealt with in a straight forward manner in mainstream films. Since the basis of the book is sex and other such naughty subjects, it was ridiculously watered down for the screen. That didn't bode well for the film. At all. But really, the bad script was the least of this film's problems.

Valley started off with all the elements of what a good movie typically has - fairly popular and acclaimed actors (both Patty Duke and Susan Hayward won Oscars before this and Barbara Parkins was nominated for an Emmy for her role as bad girl Betty Anderson on Peyton Place), a competent director (Two time Oscar nominee Mark Robson), talented and highly acclaimed songwriters (Andre and Dory Previn), an internationally known fashion designer (Travilla), and the backing of a major studio (Fox) with oodles of money. Despite all these elements, the film still fails on almost every front. It is almost unfathomable how they got so many things wrong but you can trust they did. There's terrible dialog, crazy overacting, insane situations, bad clothing and terrible songs. You can tell everyone involved tried to make a good film, but either the stars weren't aligned or everyone was really on dolls during the making of this film.

Despite Valley's badness, it is still highly entertaining. Completely ridiculous most of the time, but still highly entertaining. How can one not be entertained when watching a woman, nay, a STAR, wander around a seedy  street muttering to herself only to end up in an alley screaming her own name to the sky? You have to have ice water running through your veins if you don't get emotional while watching the social mixer at the sanatorium (""It's NOT a nut house!"") scene. Those scenes are really the tip of the terrible iceberg. As soon as you think this film can't get any more insane, it manages to squeeze just a little more crazy out of the tube.

Don't get me wrong, Valley does have some good points but they're few and far between. There is some decent acting by Barbara Parkins (Anne Welles), Paul Burke (Lyon Burke) and Sharon Tate (Jennifer Polar), but that's mostly due to the fact that those characters weren't all that over the top to begin with. Surprisingly, the questionable acting comes from the people who are actually renowned for being good actors. Patty Duke (Neely O'Hara) is responsible for quite a few of the more memorable scenes (ie bad) in the film. The character of Neely was a juicy role but Duke went a little too far with it. She's not unwatchable, just a little too big for the room. Same goes for Susan Hayward (Helen ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" Lawson). She's just not terribly convincing as a Ethel Merman-esque character. Granted, she was a good actress but for whatever reason, Hayward chose to sneer nearly every line of dialog. As for her lip syncing, high entertainment for all the wrong reasons. I don't know if Hayward was savaged by the critics but Duke certainly was. Understandably, Duke hasn't been all that keen on talking about the film, but has lightened up about it in recent years.

As popular as Valley is on the cult film scene, it was hard to find on home video for years. When I heard that it was being released by Fox (along with another fave of mine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Valley-of-the-Dolls/dp/B000EXDSC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a>), I couldn't wait to get it. I was actually surprised that Fox really pulled out all the stops for this release. A lot of older films are released by studios as a bare bones kind of affair, but Fox included some pretty good extras. There are three documentaries; the first one, Gotta Get Off This Merry-Go-Round: Sex, Dolls and Showtunes, deals with the songs of the film. It ran a little long but is otherwise pretty good. Another documentary, Valley of the Dolls: A World Premiere Voyage, was made in 1967 and is hosted by Army Archerd. The title tells you what it covers - the premiere of Valley on a cruise ship in fabulous European locations. I presume this was made by Fox to promote the film. When and where this was shown is something I've never figured out. It is fairly interesting if you like watching infotainment from the 1960s as most of the footage is clearly staged and chalked full of more corn than a box of corn flakes. In one scene, Tony Scotti (who played lounge lizard Tony Polar) lip syncs ""Come Live With Me"" to a slightly uncomfortable looking woman by a pool. I don't know why this was included but it's funny...and slightly creepy. Other features include a stills gallery, two featurettes, a trivia game, some kind of karaoke game which I have never bothered with, and screen tests. Screen tests are always fun to watch and Fox even dug in their vaults to include the screen test for Judy Garland. Garland was initially hired to play Helen Lawson but ended up being replaced by Susan Hayward for various reasons. It's heartbreaking to watch her screen test because she likely would have been great in the role, but she was obviously skating on thin ice by that time and would be dead a mere two years later.

Last but not least, there's the audio commentary with Barbara Parkins and former E! gossip guy Ted Casablanca (Can you tell he's fan of the film? Can you?). Commentaries are either terribly annoying or fantastically entertaining. Valley's commentary falls into the terribly annoying category. Parkins is tolerable as she still has that fantastic voice, but she doesn't really dish any dirt. Casablanca on the other hand treads the line between slightly annoying and super annoying. He's a superfan of the film (if you haven't guessed by now) and fawns over Parkins like it's 1965 and she can get him a walk on part on Peyton Place. I think the commentary would have been a lot more interesting had Patty Duke participated. Evidently she was asked but declined which isn't all that surprising considering her tolerate/hate relationship with the film.

Overall, this is a fantastic release that I'm pleased to finally own. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a soft spot for campy films as Valley is the top dog of camp and terrible acting. If you're looking for great cinema, you will be disappointed. Seriously. Don't buy or rent it and then complain about it. Valley's reputation has proceeded it for the last 45(!) years. Unless you have been living under a rock, you should have some inkling that Valley of the Dolls is not the Citizen Kane of the 1960s. We all KNOW it's bad, that's why we love it!",1353542400,,7551,4.728170083523159

The ultimate test of a cult classic is re-watchability.  There are tons of cheesy movies that are fun to watch once or twice -- but how many can delight upon repeated reviewings, movies that only get better as you can recite your favorite lines along with the actors?

By that standard, Valley of the Dolls is a true classic.  While it doesn't stick exactly to the plot of the book (in fact, the changes prompted screenwriter Harlan Ellison -- yes, THAT Harlan Ellison -- to remove his name from the credits), the benefits of the movie format more than make up for it.  The glorious colors and costumes, the amazingly campy musical numbers, the luminous beauty of Sharon Tate and Barbara Parkins, the non-stop energy and scenery chewing of Patty Duke, the wig-snatching glories of the plot -- this story was made to be seen, not just read.

2543545,4,B000EXDSCA,"Valley of the Dolls(1967) is a lurid, campy melodrama based on Jacqueline Susann's novel. It stars Barbara Parkins, Patty Duke, and the late Sharon Tate. The film made a lot of money in ticket sales, but many movie critics gave it bad reviews.
Neely O' Hara, Anne Welles, and Jennifer North work in Hollywood and they end up addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills(""dolls""). The film has good production values and a good music score by John Williams. Dionne Warwick sings the film's theme song. Valley of the Dolls does have some laughable moments. Neely O' Hara's insults are garbled in some scenes and Anne Welles' opportunity to be a model pops out of nowhere! I think Valley of the Dolls might be one of the first Hollywood movies to use ""four letter words"". Valley of the Dolls was remade for television in 1981 and in 1995. Russ Meyer directed a semi-sequel to this film for 20th Century Fox in 1970, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Mark Robson directed Valley of the Dolls. He also directed the 1974 disaster film Earthquake. Valley of the Dolls looks and feels like a 1960's movie. Women in the film have beehive hair dos and fur coats. There's tacky colors painted on some sets. Barbara Parkins is very sexy and elegant as Anne Welles. She was a cast member on Peyton Place. Patty Duke is decent and over the top as Neely O' Hara. Sharon Tate is quite good and lovely as Jennifer North. Lee Grant and Susan Hayward are good in supporting roles. Valley of the Dolls satirized the sins and scandals of 1960's entertainers. Today's paparazzi and reporters are constantly looking for stories to report on today's celebrities. Valley of the Dolls is a guilty pleasure from 1960's Hollywood.",1337472000,3,1694,4.6879194630872485

Yes, it's still entertaining, in an over-the-top way. But unless you are a fan of overacting, then you may be less than enthralled. Patty Duke is the most overdone. She plays the Lindsey Lohan of 1966, as a 26-year-old Broadway star who gets drugged up. The late Sharon Tate comes off best as the no-talent who uses her body for ""nudie"" films. Barbara Parkins, then the hottest one of all from the TV series ""Peyton Place,"" has since been forgotten, and she plays the most straight-laced. Even for the late 60s, this was an old-fashioned film, but they tried to appeal to kids with then-risque topics. It is quite silly. Some people know every word of this thing.

Just listening to Patty's character, Neeley, screaming out for Dolls makes me snicker! Since everyone else goes into the storyline, there really isn't anything I could say that would spoil this for first time viewers. Barbara Parkins was a beautiful young woman but she's stiff as a board in this. She plays Anne, a young woman seeking her fortune in New York City who becomes a famous model, and that seemingly happens overnight! Patty Duke, a normally good actress, is just so ""out there"" as a Judy Garland type, (with not an ounce of the charm of the real Garland), and the dialogue given to her character is so insipid you can't help but cringe and laugh! The gorgeous Sharon Tate, as a sweet showgirl turned porn actress, has really nothing to do except look beautiful and she easily gets our sympathy just by knowing what tragedy would befall her in real life! And poor Susan Hayward, as an Ethel Merman type, (REALLY???), gives a bitchy performance, and with only so so vocal dubbing to a less than memorable song.

It would disabuse future generations of any nostalgia for trashy, '60s, American cinematic kitsch. Apart from this merely potential boon, the film does serve as a thorough repudiation of those who bemoan the prevalence of nudity and sex in modern film.  Aside from outright suppression, a healthy dollop of nudity and sex is the only thing that might have saved this film. Ok, maybe it is possible to enjoy the sheer BADNESS of the movie. (I will admit I find it far more enjoyable than, say, Mommy Dearest.) But there is no doubt it is trite, shallow, and trashy.  The plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is absurd, and much of the acting is abysmal, although it is really hard to blame the actors given what they had to work with.  But perhaps that is too strong. I really didn't mind Barbara Perkins. She was very pretty and stayed more or less in character throughout, even if her character had the emotional depth of a wading pool.  Patty Duke was thoroughly hateful and WAY over the top, and her final scene is bad acting at its worst, but how else could she play the part?  As to Sharon Tate, she was stunning.  The only real reason to watch this movie other than a perverse interest in kitsch or as a primer on the elements of a bad movie is to gaze upon Sharon Tate.  Of course, it is impossible to tell from this movie if she could act. She certainly didn't here and her performance is dreadfully stiff and awkward. But she was so beautiful, and it is so sad to watch her knowing the fate that was to befall her.

2543578,4,B000EXDSCA,"When I was 17 years old in 1967, I was wandering around Broadway in New York City.  ""Valley of the Dolls"" was playing at the Criterion or Loews State, (I forget which,) and the place seemed to be jammed with people waiting to get in.  I heard a lot about the film and decided to join them, even though this was supposedly a film made for adults and I was still only 17.  I was very proud to go home later and announce to everyone that I had seen ""Valley of the Dolls.""  I really don't remember whether I thought it was any good.
I'd seen it a few times since then, but had not seen it for a while.  I picked up the DVD and watched it last night.  The film is quite silly and campy with a wildly over-the-top performance from  Patty Duke.
And I enjoyed it immensely.
The picture and sound quality are wonderful, the music by John Williams excellent, the wonderful theme song by Dionne Warwicke very memorable.  I enjoyed the location work in New York.  The film opens up on a snowy, slushy day in New York City, exactly the type of weather we've had here for the past month.
Barbara Parkins is beautiful and so aristocratic looking in the lead role, I absolutely thought she was so great looking at the time.  And she never looked better than here.  The costumes are beautiful.
The special features on the disk are almost as entertaining as the film.  The film is apparently greatly beloved by homosexuals.  And there is a long retrospective of a group of gay film critics and filmmakers discussing what they love about the film.  This segment had me laughing continuously.  You will learn some things about the film you might not have known such as Judy Garland originally scheduled to play the role of Helen Lawson (eventually played by Susan Hayward.)  The star of the film, Barbara Parkins, is interviewed throughout the special features and she mentions how she blames the director (Mark Robson) for letting Patty Duke go so over the top is her performance as Neely O'Hara.  There are also screen tests including Barbara auditioning for Neely (not Anne) and doing an absolutely excellent job.  Theres a bouncing ball Karioke of the various songs from this film, trailers and an excellent AMC Back Story.  (I used to really enjoy those.)
As stated, the film is totally unrealistic and completely over the top, the dialogue tremendously campy, the special features on disk one and two very entertaining as well.  Pick it up, it might bring back some amusing memories.  It certainly did for me.",1296950400,6,2495,4.586907449209932

2543597,5,B000EXDSCA,"""Valley of the Dolls"" is the film version of the Jacqueline Susann novel. It is the dramatization of what happens to three young girls who come to Hollywood, their dreams discovered, then ultimately shattered. Patty Duke, Sharon Tate, and Barbara Parkins star. Most consider the film absolute trash, but I consider it pure camp escapist entertainment. The film also explores the terrible drug culture that was predominant in the 1960's. Judy Garland was suppose to star as old Broadway headliner Helen Lawson, but was ultimately fired and replaced by Susan Hayward. The best line in the film is by Hayward, when she yells at Nealy, played by Patty Duke,...""you come back here from Hollywood...well Broadway has no time for booze and dope!!!!"". Great Fun!!!!
 This DVD is the special edition of the film, and I only wish all studios would give their films this kind of treatment. The movie comes in two discs, one for the movie and the other for the special features which are many. The bonus gems are a great commentary by Barbara Parkins and columnist Ted Casablanca, still galeries, documentaries on the film, screen tests, rare footage of the filming, a featurette on Jacqueline Susaan, and much more. The film has been cleaned and looks superb in widescreen. There are also 20 lobby cards included. There is a cute little booklet that comes with this edition featuring anecodtes of the film. The discs are enclosed in a beautiful pink DVD case, which in turn is protected by a covered carboard case.

I would have liked to see her do a cameo. Such as overdose and die (very) early in the film! Sharon Tate was not an actress. I'm sorry. She died horribly and too young but that does not change the fact that she simply could not act! Therefore, her casting was right on target. Susan Hayward could have done without the very dated, badly styled and ugly red wig. The white hair, exposed during the catfight, actually softened her features and was much more flattering! Barbara Parkins had the dramatic range of a rock. And she must have staggered through Tide Country during her big ""dramatic"" (?) scene, somewhere between the beach (wet , muddy white robe) to the house (clean, dry, white robe).

2543611,3,B000EXDSCA,"I was really, really looking forward to this film long before I ever got the chance to sit down and watch it.  The whole concept behind the film, the novel and everyone involved just really seemed right up my ally.  I love the whole gritty and realistic exploitation of human imperfections.  It touches my warm and fuzzies for some reason.

I really expected `Valley of the Dolls' to be that type of film.  It was labeled as grievously controversial and it is still considered by many to be a film that pushes the envelope; especially for the time period.  Well, it truly does push the envelope, but the end result is far from what I expected.  Instead of developing a raw and real interpretation of addiction and the suffering the famous endure, `Valley of the Dolls' winds up feeling like half a thought; half a film.  It has all the makings of something sincere yet falls short of a complete finished product, for it never really develops its characters in a way the sheds any substantial light on the subject.

It's a surface film so-to-speak; a film that just skims over the top of these issues without really getting down to heart of the matter.

I know that many will disagree with me; but I'm sure that there are at least a few who know what I'm saying here.

The film tells the story of three young women who all fall victim to the machine known as fame.  They seek it out and once they attach themselves to it they realize that the only way to keep the dream alive is to feed it their soul.  Anne Welles, Neely O'Hara and Jennifer North are all putting themselves out there, but what they get in return for their lives is barely anything worth holding onto.

The film tries hard to show the backstabbing environment created by Hollywood; the aged starlets fighting for attention; the self loathing caused by lack of real talent; the abuse brought on by family members and so-called friends; the depression that sets in from lack of work; the ego that destroys everything good in our lives and of course the destitution that becomes those fallen victim to the `dolls' (or prescription drugs).  The issue I have with the film is that it never takes any of these subjects seriously enough to tie together the loose ends and make them feel completed.  It raises the concerns without really delving into the solutions.  It's just kind of a hodgepodge of bad situations without any connective tissue.

It felt incomplete to me.

I felt that the acting was a major saving grace for the film though, because almost everyone involved worked to add notes to their otherwise `one-note' characters.  Patty Duke especially nailed her role as the `diva' Neely O'Hara.  The film has a tendency to fall into camp (not sure if that was intentional, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was) but she handles her lines so well that she cuts the camp and gives her character some genuineness.  Sharon Tate has more talent than her character, but Barbara Parkins, who is the films star, comes off rather dull.  The men take a backseat, except Paul Burke who manages to make himself known in a good way.

This isn't a bad film, but it far from a great masterpiece; which is sad because it had all the potential in the world.  With all the harsh subject matter and meaty potential it winds up feeling a little empty.",1235606400,7,3300,4.561969439728353

2543615,5,B000EXDSCA,"Today's big celebrated DVD is the camp classic Valley Of The Dolls from 1967. Released as a two disc collection this DVD has a ton and ton of extras plus the 2 hour movie featuring Patty Duke as the over the top Neely O'Hara, Barbara Parkins as Anne Welles, and beautiful Sharon Tate as Jennifer North - the gal with no talent but a body to get her ahead. Why I've never seen this is beyond me - oh wait, I know why, because in 1981 there was a TV version of the film and in it Lisa Hartman played Neely; and to me that is the Valley I remember.

However, knowing this original film released shortly after the infamous book spent umpteen months at #1 on the Bestseller list, I was curious to know what the fuss was all about. Let me tell you, it is great. The songs are pretty sucky, the dialogue fairly cliched, and Patty's performance so over the top I'm surprised the scenery didn't come crashing down. Boobies, boobies, boobies! is just one classic line shooting forth from La Duke's pouty lips. I mean, she totally makes the movie, and mixed in with Barbara's classy Anne and Sharon's very subtle Jennifer, this is one classic flick.

Patty, up until just recently has complete disdain for this movie and hardly talks about it, but I am here to tell you that she rocks it. Screaming and pouting, laughing, crying and taking those dolls - she has the meatiest role in the film.

I've met Patty a few times when I lived in Idaho and she was always really cool and pleasant but to see her on the screen in this film gives me a whole new kudos for her. My pal just did her website and I can't wait to tell him to run and run until he finds his copy of this film because he's going to love it.

Now I have to go back and watch my 1981 version again and see if Lisa's Neely is anywhere near as over the top as Duke's. I hope so, I really can't remember. I do know that the 1981 version is supposedly closer to the original book than the movie (which Jacqueline Susann walked out of declaring, ""You've ruined my book!"") but the ending scene of the original with Patty and pretty much every scene with Neely is a complete riot. I'll have to get back to you on how it compares with my girl - if anything- I can say that Lisa's songs are much more interesting than Patty's but what can you do.

In short, rent it, buy it, love it and laugh!",1214352000,2,2335,4.1915367483296215

To be sure, there ARE several over-the-top moments- usually involving a character using pills and/or booze or commenting on another character's use of same- but they're just that, moments, not non-stop unintentional hilarity.  Okay, the gay icons were right about the wig-in-the-toilet scene... THAT was pretty crazy.  Endless special features throughout this two-disc set and an absolutely crystal clear restored print of the film make this DVD a must-see for fans of sixties cinema.

2543618,5,B000EXDSCA,"Don't believe all that you read, this film is considered a poor film due to the acting and what not. NOT TRUE. This film is a  GREAT melodrama. The performances are great, especially those of the three leading females, Patty Duke, Barbara Parkins, and Sharon Tate. Parkins (who is mostly known before this film from the classic television series PEYTON PLACE) is stunningly beautiful and a great actress. Sadly due to the poor reception of this film, she did not carry on to star in other films. This is one of the few films that Tate starred in because she was one among those murdered by Charles Manson. Sad, because she was a true beauty and a classy actress. If you enjoy a good drama, and better acting than what is seen mostly on television and soap operas these days, BUY THIS MOVIE.

It does follow the plot line of the book that it is based on, but it has been toned down in the sexuality, language, and certain plot lines. Nevertheless it is a true classic story of three women whose lives are slowly shattered by the need for fame, love, and men. I don't want to give too much away of the plot, because it is an enjoyable film. I have read the book, and seen this film multiple times. IT'S A TRUE CLASSIC THAT IS A MUST OWN!!",1198713600,4,1236,4.346320346320346

2543621,5,B000EXDSCA,"To be honest I didn't find this nearly as campy as I thought it would be.  The years have been kind to this film in that regard.  As traditional Hollywood acting has gone downhill, and as this movie had incredible production values, it actually isn't a whole lot more campy than what you'd find playing this weekend.  But it is a whole lot more interesting!

It's got larger than life characters, good dialog, tragedy, comedy, great sets, and the beautiful Sharon Tate. I'd say it only falls into camp mostly during some of Patty Duke's scenes, especially towards the end.  But it's necessary to have a bit of soap opera to a movie like this. It wouldn't sit right if it didn't.

If you've avoided this movie based on its reputation I highly recommend you pick it up and try it for yourself.  It's quite a unique and exciting movie experience whether you are into ""campy cult classics"" or not.",1190332800,4,893,4.54375

2543623,5,B000EXDSCA,"""Valley Of The Dolls"" is probably one of the funniest movies ever turned out by Hollywood and this 2-disc edition does it justice.  Interestingly, it was one of the year's biggest box office money makers when it was first released -- and justifiably so!  High school students who devoured the best trashy roman a cle ever written flocked to see what was then a real shocker.

All of the acting is super camp and way over-the-top.  Supposedly, the director hated Patty Duke (so she says in the extras DVD) and it shows.  Every shot is basically unflattering and he made her screech like an out of control banchee.  Barbara Parkins is the Vasser graduate who just acts shocked by everything but still is able to sleep with the handsome star and become a super model due to her classy looks and high cheekbones.  Her acting is so understated she comes across as a high couture zombie whose role model is Jackie O. The piece-de-resistance is Susan Hayward as the crass, vulgar, yet supposedly immensely talented, ""Ethel Merman"" knock-off, Helen Lawson.  The Margret Whiting dubbed version of the unbelievably ridiculous song, ""I'll Plant My Own Tree and I'll Make It Grow,"" defies description.  Plus, her sequined outfits cost a fortune and all had to be re-made since Judy Garland stole the originals when she was fired from this picture.  The extras includes Judy Garland's press conference; this alone is worth the total cost.  Susan Hayward has the most quoted scene when Patty Duke flushes her wig down the john and she delivers the classic line, ""They drummed you right out of Hollywood so you come crawlin' back to Broadway.  Well, Broadway don't go for booze and dope.""

Small roles are not to be ignored and each performer maximzes the impact of their terribly written parts.  Lee Grant is super creepy as Sharon Taste's paranoid mother-in-law, Martin Milner is a very funny patsy to Patty Duke  and Toni Scotti looks like a young mobster (and we never heard from him again) with a weak Al Martino voice.  Another classicly funny scene is Tony Scotti and Patty Duke warbling, ""Comne Live With Me"", in the nursing home/asylum.

Interesting, the only actress who comes across unscathed is Sharon Tate.  She looks stunning and is a very touching actress, the only one who is believable in this unrealistic romp.  But, she does get to tell Barbara Parkins, ""You know how bitchy fags can be!""

""Valley Of The Dolls"" is the greatest!  I never tire of seeing it or hearing the absurd dialogue.  It deserves to be preserved right up there with ""Gone With Wind.""  And well deserved credit for the original concept goes to Jackie Susaan who has a great little cameo as a TV reporter.

While Barbara Parkins says she thinks it was filmed in Greenwich, CT. this is not correct.  Most of the New England portion of the movie was filmed in Bedford Village, Katonah and Yorktown Heights, NY -- all about 40 miles from NYC.

It took years for this to come to DVD.  Buy it before they pull it from the shelves.",1183420800,4,2998,4.704414587332054
2543624,5,B000EXDSCA,"I can't believe it has actually been a year since this little gem finally came out on dvd. I have watched it repeatedly since its release and it NEVER ceases to amaze and astound me. From Ms. Duke's anything-but-subtle performance (and that's all I am going to say on the subject since it's been covered here so many times before) to the luminous Sharon Tate as the talentless (although ironically she gives us the best performance of the three female leads here by far) top-heavy Jennifer to the beautiful Barbara Parkins walking through the whole movie as if she's in a daze, still pinching herself that she actually got the most juicy part of her entire career to, last but not least, the incomparable Susan Hayward's scene-stealing turn as the legendary Helen Larson. Although the part was intended for Judy Garland, Ms. Hayward takes the ball and runs with it, commanding your attention in every scene she's in, relishing every venomous line she's been given and delivering them all like they were hard bitchslaps, leaving her less-seasoned co-stars down for the count. Fox may not be proud of this fact but this soapy saga was the biggest box office hit of '67 and despite its obvious flaws it's still easy to see why. Trash sells, especially delicious trash. From the overboard acting to the choppy screenplay right down to the ridiculous music score, this is THE camp classic by which all others should be judged!

The extras are great.  Even the vintage stuff about Susanne and the premier cruise.  The only gaping hole that I found was the audio commentary.  Ted Casablancas did his best to keep it lite and entertaining but Barbara Parkins either had a hard time remembering on set anecdotes or was playing coy.  I found it extremely unbelievable when he asked her about Sharon Tate's body and dieting in the 60s.  The response was something like 'oh we just didn't think about it.'  Hello?  Judy Garland learned about it as a kid in Hollywood and Neeley O'Hara one of the main characters was obsessed about it among other things.

2543651,5,B000EXDSCA,"You either love the movie or you don't. If you're a VoD lover, the Special Edition 2-disk release is worth every cent. The film is beautifully restored to its ""Color by De Luxe"" and Panavision widescreen glory. (My VHS tape is on a barge making its way to the Staten Island landfill as I type this). The second disk includes karioke renderings of songs along with several documentaries and featurettes (all listed above). My favorite of these is ""Jacqueline Susann and Valley of the Dolls,"" which has generous film clips depicting the chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking for herself and coming across as, more than anything, a highly committed and indefatigable professional writer (who used a different color of typing paper for each of her six drafts of the manuscript). It's easy to see how this no-nonsense, get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin the procratinating perfectionist and celebrity syncophant Truman Capote. (I was surprised to see no mention of their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among the DVD extras.)

The missed opportunity among all the extras was the commentary track on Disk One. It was great to have Barbara Parkins (although her memories seem to have grown rather dim over the years). One would have liked to hear from Patty Duke (or even Leigh Grant) as well, though we can only guess why Fox wasn't able to make that happen. But the commentary could have been greatly enriched if Fox had nixed the use of gossip columnist Ted Cassablanca (who stole his nom de plume from a gay character in the novel) and engaged a truly informed movie critic or film historian to co-comment with Ms Parkins. Casablanca badgers Parkins for ""dish"" on the other actresses, Sharon Tate's murder, Judy Garland's walking out on the Helen Lawson role; and when he's not badgering, he cooing about her perfume or comparing notes with her on which actors in the film they each found ""do-able."" (Parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes and thought of singer Cat Stevens in England.) Both Parkins and Casablanca are surprisingly ignorant of basic facts about the film. I found myself frequently shouting at the TV screen, ""Watch Disk Two--it's all explained there!""

Among the things I still don't understand: Why do so many people dimiss or discount Hayward's performance as the Merman-inspired Helen Lawson? Hayward comes solidly out of ""the women's picture"" tradition and seems to be perfectly cast. Her singing voice, supplied by veteran big-band singer Margaret Whiting (that's Mrs. Jack Wrangler to you, Ted Casablanca), was a perfect match (raw with years of backstage smoking). But, the only explanation I can come up with is that Ms Garland's fans so much wanted to see her in another singing role they shun Hayward's performance out of perverse loyalty to Garland. (Garland died two years after the release of VoD, perhaps adding a degree of fierceness to her fans' loyalty.)

The Special Edition DVD overemphasizes the camp and cult elements of the movie (the ""bouncing ball"" in the karioke rendering of Lawson's ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" is really a red wig that ends up in a cartoon toilet on the final sustained note of the song). Such thing make for fun viewing ONCE. But the movie, the movie is a delicious treat that lasts forever.",1156550400,6,3296,5.010948905109489
2543652,5,B000EXDSCA,"Yes, you can come home. When Patty Duke belts out her first song you just know this is going to be gawd awful good. Her twitchy body, coupled with an out-of-key voice is a hoot. And not to give anything away for the newbies but you will be on the floor when she sings in the sanitarium. This is a beautiful looking movie. The colors shine. The sound is terrific. John Williams gets the only Academy Award for original score. What no Dion Warwick for Theme from Valley of the Dolls? I was surprised there was no nomination. The trivia track, yes there is a track filled with trivia, mentions an issue of the song released for radio(a different version) and the one played on movie. Maybe an issue here? There is a commentary track by Barbara Parkins but I was disappointed that there was only one voice from the movie. It would have been better if there could have been a couple more. There are many extras, many of which I haven't seen yet. A nice package of extras. This had to be a career destroying movie. Only Lee Grant and John Williams seemed to come out unscathed. And Susan Hayward? What was she thinking? As the star among stars she actually looks like the only actor in the movie, but her laughable stage and singing performance scenes along with the obligatory female cat fight with the Patty Duke character keeps this movie rolling in schlock. This movie is filled with past and future Academy Award winners, Grant, Duke, Hayward, Williams, and Martin Milner(just kidding). And watch for an appearance by Richard Dreyfus, no less, towards the end of the movie. This is a 5 star movie for the genre.

2543653,1,B000EXDSCA,"I absolutely abhor this film. Want to know why? Because it labled 'Valley of the Dolls' and everything Jacqueline Susann ever wrote into 'great campy fun'. Now I don't know this for certain, but I don't think Jacqueline Susann wanted people to see her books as cheesy comedies. I think she wanted people to take her work seriously, and with this awfully made film, no one did. To others, the film might be so bad it's funny, but to devoted fans of the book it's just depressing. The movie was made in 1967, a year after the book was published and you can see that Jacqueline Susann was ahead of her time, because the film is poorly adapted and very censored. You know you have a problem when the book would receive an R rating if transferred onto the screen, but the movie is only rated PG. Besides the sex scenes, language, pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out, important details to the plot are also missing. Anne's hatred of Lawrenceville, Helen Lawson's screen time, Jennifer's complicated and somewhat absuive relationship with Tony, Allen and Gino Cooper, Henry's character development, Jennifer's relationship with the Senator (and the reason she committs suicide), the tragic ending, etc are all either missing or are shortened down. I don't care if the movie would have been almost three hours long, I think if they had stuck close enough to the book, then everything would have been fine. What a shame. And please don't mention the casting of actors. Save for Patty Duke, I thought everyone else did a horrible job. Some of the actors didn't even look the physical part (in the book Anne is actually a blonde, Helen Lawson has dark hair and Jennifer is curvy). The thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade? It's almost forty years later, and I think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation. How about Kate Bosworth as Anne Welles, Scarlett Johansson as Jennifer North, Keira Knightly as Neely O'Hara, Joaquin Phoenix as Lyon Burke, and Liza Minnelli as Helen Lawson? Well I doubt that will ever happen, so in the meantime I recommend reading the book instead, and taking it seriously the way Jacqueline Susann had intended it to be.",1154822400,6,2245,4.729591836734694

2543657,4,B000EXDSCA,"Watching Valley Of The Dolls is like eating pink cotton candy for 123 minutes - it may make you sick, but you can't stop eating! Valley Of The Dolls is slick, glossy, campy and almost totally devoid of talent. With the exception of the theme song and the sweet and sincere performance of the beautiful Sharon Tate, the rest of the film is laughable - perhaps that is why it is loved by so many fans. Barbara Parkins' performance is like watching a lovely, placid lake with an occasional ripple. Oscar-winner, Susan Hayward, who replaced the fragile Judy Garland, gives a respectable performance. Most of the time, Patty Duke's acting is so over-the-top it's hard to watch - much like looking at a car wreck by the side of the road. She screams, bitches, scowls and chews the scenery in probably the worst performance by any Oscar-winning actress. The costumes and hair-dos are outrageously overdone and every actress in the film has a high-fashion costume change and an elaborate hair-do for each scene. No subtly here either - even a simple walk on the beach requires what looks like a cocktail dress. The theme song performed by Dionne Warwick is haunting and beautiful, but the other songs are so weak, it would have been difficult for any actress to come off looking talented with such mediocre material. Valley Of The Dolls has a large cult following because it has the temerity to be so bad and so outrageous and makes no apologies. After all is said and done, you really should watch Valley Of The Dolls on your own terms. You may love it! While you're at it, check out Myra Breckenridge 1970 (also 20th Century Fox) with Raquel Welch and Mae West - in may ways, it is even more outrageous & campy than Dolls - and it offers some wonderful vintage film clips of the stars of the 1930s and 1940s!",1151798400,10,1802,4.58204334365325
2543658,5,B000EXDSCA,"""Valley of the Dolls"", based on the sensational best-seller by Jaqueline Susann, is a guilty pleasure of mine. To call it ""trashy"" isn't quite the right word to describe it. It's spectacularly mediocre. The dialogue IS bad, but not shriekingly so, it's really just, well, bad. Bad and flat. The performances? They're garden variety bland, the kind of somnabulistic stuff that reigned in prime time soaps like ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas"". Many of the film's performers cut their teeth in television, and it shows. The men are bland and uncharismatic Ken dolls, and while Barbara Parkins and the late Sharon Tate are certainly lovely, are just barely animated Barbies. The ""standout"" performances, if one can call them that, are Patty Duke's unlovable guttersnipe Neely O'Hara (THAT's supposed to be a talented, magnetic star?), and the great Susan Hayward's whiskey-bass, tough-as-nails Helen Lawson. Jackie Susann's book, while certainly not ""great"" literature, had grit, sex, and made some sense, beginning in 1947 and ending in 1963. In the film, the viewer is expected to believe that the story, following the rise and fall of three young women in show business, takes place in the span of one year...1967! ""Dolls"" was lambasted by Jackie Susann, drubbed by critics, and made a mountain of money for 20th Century Fox. It nearly killed the career of Patty Duke, did nothing to further the careers of the actors, and went on to become a huge cult favorite, especially with gay audiences, who saw right through the transparent, ludicrous phoniness of the whole thing and embraced it..including yours truly. I still don't know why I'm so fascinated with this film! 20th Century Fox Home Video has released ""Valley of the Dolls"" and Russ Meyer's ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" (which, in my opinion, is a far superior and way funnier film) in deluxe 2-disc editions that will delight fans of campy, laughable films for years to come. ""Valley"", to start with, looks great. The picture is crisp, the colors beautiful and rich, and the sound quality is excellent. The extras are a mixed bag. The commentary by Barbara Parkins (who knew she was so funny?) and E!'s Ted Casablanca is fun, Ms. Parkins is a delight to listen to...she still has that marvelous sexy ladylike voice! A new documentary, ""Gotta Get Off This Merry-Go-Round: Sex, Dolls and Showtunes"", is alternately amusing and irritating. Ms. Parkins is fun, as well as Michael Musto, but I found Alonso Duralde, author of ""101 Must-See Movies for Gay Men"", rather glib and smug and not as smart as HE thinks he is (how do these queens manage to have successful careers?). He's repulsive. Also, cast members of the stage production of ""Valley of the Dolls"" offer some very funny comments and insights on this rather dubious material. The other featurettes, ""The Divine Ms. Susann"", ""Hollywood Backstories: Valley of the Dolls"", ""Valley of the Dolls: A World Premiere Voyage"" ""Jacqueline Susann and Valley of the Dolls"", are real showbiz curios (did they really DO stuff like this back then?), but the promised ""What's My Line"" show (with appearances by Judy Garland, who dropped out of the film, and Jackie Susann), as well as Miss Garland's screen tests, are sadly missing. Still galleries, ""A Pill-Popping Guide to Valley of the Dolls"", and the ""You've Got Talent"" Karaoke, and star screen tests fill out the rest of this DVD extravaganza. Ms. Parkins' screen test, where she read Neely O'Hara's part, is a lot of fun to watch, as well as watching the rather uncharismatic Tony Scotti singing ""A Man and a Woman"" to a starlet whose face has been ""grey-spotted"" out! ""Valley of the Dolls"", to me, is a real phenomenon. In a way, it's one big ""Doll"" itself...pretty, synthetic, and really not good for you, but it does produce a feeling of euphoria!",1151625600,7,3800,4.9390625
2543659,4,B000EXDSCA,"Although the extras listed on amazon are correct, the pre-release information for this DVD (and the detail listings on many other sites), include many extras that for whatever reason did not make it to the retail version.  Among them:

-Doll-A-Palooza: Addicts Forum A Go-Go

-Translate French Porn Movies

-What's My Line? Episode

- a screen test for Judy Garland

- a k.d.lang remix

While the movie is as hilariously awful as it ever was, and the included extras are terrific, be aware that these other extras are NOT on the DVD.",1151020800,9,533,4.791208791208791
2543660,5,B000EXDSCA,"Anne is prim and proper; we know this because she speaks in a whisper and looks like she's going to fall asleep talking to you.  She's also from New England where, apparently, it's always snowy.

Neely is spastic; she steals milk from doorways (wild!!) and wears double strand necklaces that do obscene things when she's singing on TV telethons. She also likes to work out in wacky split-screen montages and pours perfectly good whiskey in her swimming pool.

Jennifer is beautiful; she wears big headdresses and makes French art films (""Nudies!!!"" says Neely) where she almost spills wine into men's shoes.

What happens when these women all meet is chronicled in ""Valley of the Dolls"" - or not.  Unlike the novel, the movie never develops how any of these women become friends. The movie never develops much of anything and I wouldn't have it any other way.  This mess of a film is one of the premier examples of unintentional camp and is a true classic.  How can you hate a movie where the extras on the DVD all talk about how bad it is?  How often is that done?

Great hair, great wardrobe, bad songs, a John Williams score, Lee Grant's non-sequitirs (""At night, all cats are gray"" - what?) and Susan Hayward's neo-classical outfit while she sings about growing trees are just a few delights that await you.  The best part of ""Dolls"" is that it was made in an era where the Hayes code was overruled, but ""Dolls"" wasn't willing to go all the way into edgy so it strikes an unhappy medium between two worlds.  The film we get is a traditional looking, eye-poppingly colorful, Hollywood spectacle where the word ""fag"" is tossed around like a salad and the characters go through with their abortions, unlike in director Mark Robson's previous scandalous movie, ""Peyton Place"" where the Hayes code forced a character to simply miscarry.  One of Robson's later films was ""Earthquake"" which would serve well as a double feature with ""Dolls"".

""Valley of the Dolls"" is the best of the worst, and what could be better than the great DVD treatment we are given here? Interviews with the stars, retrospectives, trailers ... this DVD was worth waiting for.  You no longer need to climb Mount Everest to reach the ""Valley of the Dolls"", this baby has finally arrived.",1150761600,7,2258,4.712468193384224

Sure it has a few scenes of Camp and the hair is just too big, but it is still a good movie that I'd give three stars.  Okay, Patty chewed the scenery.  Do you all know that that's how the director wanted it?  Patty didn't want to do it that way.  I myself think that that was a great performance because that's how Neely should have been, over the top and childish.  Barbara Parkins was just classy without much to do but look concerned, and Sharon Tate turned in the best performance out of all three.  She had some bad lines, and I mean bad, but she acted them so well that it was good.  If you've seen her screen test you'd know she was the best choice and had a more natural approach to the first phone call to her mother, whereas the director made her yell everything at once and led you to know that there was air on the other end.  I guess that's why, out of everyone else, she got a Golden Globe nomination and was listed runner-up for THE STAR OF TOMMORROW.  What plagued this film was bad directing, writing, and the male actors that seemed too old or just weren't good.",1150761600,4,1140,4.1880733944954125
2543672,5,B000EXDSCA,"VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is loaded with so many things that can go wrong with a movie: bad 1960's fashion, misguided musical numbers, hairdos that defy logic, way over the top scenes with actresses  doing things so they will never again be taken seriously as an artist. It's a train wreck of a movie that will have you screaming with delight and  quoting dialoge for days.

VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is the often told story of innocent beauties moving to the big city to find fame and glamour; fortunately for lovers of bad cinema this fame comes with a price: addiction to booze/pills, loss of love, drinking Scotch straight out of the bottle, a cat fight with wig snatching in the ladies room, falling down drunk in back alleys, strait-jackets, .... I could go on and on.  I think the intention of the film to was be serious drama showing the horrors of addcition. However, it did not turn out that way. Addiction and madness have never looked so glamerous or as fun as presented in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS.

This DVD is a glittering 2 dics extravaganza loaded with extras. There are lots and lots of behind-the-scences looks at the making of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, Jacqueline Susann bio stuff, Judy Garland wearing Helen Lawson's wardrobe, photo galleries, and trailers. Ths movie itself is a beautiful widescreen presentation. This two disc set is a loving tribute to this classic of camp.

VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is essential to lovers of so-bad-it-must-be seen-but-still-can't-be believed filmaking. BUY THIS DVD!",1150675200,2,1499,4.790697674418604

And all are a scream. It's a cavalcade of camp, one of the funniest most unintentionally funny films of all time. While in 1967 they clearly thought they were making a faithful adaptation of a bestseller (kind of a sixties version of ""The Firm"" or ""The DaVinci Code"") in 2006 the producers of this 2 disc set know exactly what they have on their hands and have treated it accordingly. The extras are terrific. My favorite is the commentary by Barbara Parkins and the inspired/inevitable Ted Casablanca from E!, who took his nom de plume from Neely's second husband. Their banter about the casting (and ""doability"") of actor/singer Tony Scotti are worth the price of the DVD set alone. Is it good film making? Of course not. Is it a nonstop delight? Well, if you get this sort of thing, this is the gold standard.",1150588800,4,965,4.8545454545454545
2543674,5,B000EXDSCA,"....So says Ms. O'Hara in one of my favorite scenes from one of my favorite films of all time.  God!  I wish they made'em like this nowadays.  Committed performances, un-politically correct dialogue (all those ""fag"" words just make my day!), a juicy story, gorgeous clothes, beautiful score (YES!  I love even Neely's ""It's Impossible"" number!!!), and cut-to-the-chase direction without one moment being waisted in the ongoing saga of three girls who make it to the top of their respective positions.  Parkins is the epitome of an Icy Brunette, Tate a gloriously ethereal sprite, and (best of all to me!!!), Duke is all fire & fire and fire as Neely.  Whoops!  Did I forget Ms. Hayward as Helen Lawson?  Absolutely Fabulous as she chews up all that rottenly wonderful dialogue and spits it out at whomever is within distance of her Medusa-like countenance.  Lee Grant?  I mean, where did she wander in from?.......the half sister of Tony and she makes lasagna too?  Impeccable casting all the way, although it does break my heart to think what Garland would have done with the role of Lawson (get a copy of HER version of ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" on ebay...YES, the great voice is a bit shaky at times but what Garland makes of the lyrics and sings with all the power at her command just can not compare with the version used in the film, with all due respect to the brilliant Margaret Whiting!).  The extras are great, especially the ""backstage"" feature of the making of the movie and the mini-documentary on Ms. Susanne herself from 1967.  Buy It!  Watch It!  Love It!

But you should see it if you have any interest at all in late 60's design, fashion, music (Andre Previn) and -- VIBE.

The other extras which indeed were included were terrific....but don't play with our heads and promise extras that you cannot or would not deliver.

2543677,5,B000EXDSCA,"One of the best DVD packages comes with this DVD issue of ""Valley of the Dolls"". It's loaded with extras and tidbits about everything that went into the film, before and after production. The stars, the would be stars, everything. It recalls a very show-biz '60's Hollywood. Of course, there's the film itself and a second disc loaded with info about the film.  Now, ""Dolls"" is no Oscar winner or even a nominee by a long shot. But it was considered a blockbuster in 1967 and based on a blockbuster novel. It drips with 60's kitsch and features a must see performance by a young Patty Duke trying to break her child star image with an ""adult"" role. Well, it's about as adult as you could get in 1967. As superstar Neeley O'Hara, she goes all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom, all the while popping ""dolls"" and slugging booze. There's a fire-breathing performance by Susan Hayward as an aging superstar who engages in a memorable confrontation with Duke (culminating with Duke trying to flush Hayward's wig down the toilet) and the beauty of Barbara Parkins and the stunning but tragic Sharon Tate. They are the girls (along with Duke) trying to make it in New York and Hollywood show-biz who find men, drugs, success and heartbreak...and just about in that order. The DVD print is Widescreen and flawless and the soundtrack is excellent with those Andre' Previn songs and Dionne Warwick singing the theme song throughout. This is a wonderful collector's item for those who love this film. And there's Jackie Susann herself in a cameo as a repoter.  A worth while investment all round.

2543679,5,B000EXDSCA,"My opinions on this movie differ almost completely from every other review. To me every review is the same and all everyone says how Camp this movie is. In the 1960's movies were combinations of Musical Comedies and Musical Dramas. Valley of the Dolls is not the only movie with characters singing songs and a story plot that was simple and interesting. I have never put this movie in any category especially ""Camp"". I think the music was and is still great and i enjoy this film without analyzing the acting who replaced who in the film. Too much attention is paid to analyzing it instead of just watching it. Most movies in general have strong areas and weak moments. I think the opening credits are great with the pills spilling over and the whole monologue with Barbara Parkins beauty and class. In the 60's all movies had a theme song along with the opening credits and that to me was always a big plus. People have begging to get this movie on DVD for a few years already so there has to more than just campy lines that are attracting such a vast amount of attention. I don't care who slams evetything i just said but in quote ""I LOVE THIS MOVIE"" My closing words are ""SO WHAT FATTENING THING DID ARLENE MAKE"" Heres some trivia. The theme song sung by Dionne Warwicke in the movie was not used on the soundtrack because Ms Warwick's label wouldn't allow it. The singer on the soundtrack is DORY PREVIN..she wrote the song. I much prefer Dory Previn's version. I think Dionne had an amazing voice but her version wasn't nearly as pretty.

I love, love, LOVE this movie. I was 7 when it came out, remember my mom playing the Dionne Warwick single over and over. I saw it for the first time when I was 11 on network television, and even taped the soundtrack from the television onto a tape so I could play it back whenever I wanted. That's what you did before VCRs if you were a movie crazy kid like me. Eventually I knew every single line of dialogue by heart.

Years later, watching it on the big screen at the Castro theater revival in San Francisco, I was surprised that I still remembered most of the lines. Also surprised that the movie had aged like a fine wine (or wine in a box maybe) into the quintessential trash classic of our time.

Yes, this movie is terrible ... terrible in the most fantastic way imaginable. When I was a kid, I thought I was the only one that appreciated the trashy greatness of this film. But I wasn't alone at all. People love this movie. It's everything that's great and terrible about Hollywood all rolled into one Technicolor trainwreck.

This could have been an opera taken on by Verdi. Okay it has nothing to do with Verdi and good for us it doesn't.

** ""The Dish On The Doll"" (5 mins.), feautures noted gay film critic Alonso Duralde and Michael Musto among others and is great for obsessive fans. It points out early appearances by Nathan Lane (in the TV remake), Richard Dreyfuss, and Marvin Hamlisch playing piano in the background and various bloopers. It also talks about the excellent 1981 TV remake (with Lisa Hartman as Neely, Veronica Hamel as Jennifer and Catherine Hicks as Anne) and the bad nighttime soap opera in the early 1990s called VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. At the end of this short, there's a written notice that if viewers are interested in seeing the TV movie or soap opera put on DVD, they should go to Fox Studio's web site and let someone know. Unfortunately, the link they give doesn't work and (as of 6/27/06), Fox's web site doesn't even mention VALLEY as one of their releases.

** Four Screen Tests: Tony Scotti (singing), Barbara Parkins (auditioning for Neely O'Hara) & Sharon Tate (phone conversation with Jennifer's mother) and a great test with both Tate and Scotti doing a long,walk-thru-the-park scene.

I loved this movie at 15.  Maybe it was my teenage infatuation with Barbara Parkins, the hit theme, the fab, keen, neato, psychedelic sets.  Maybe it was just being a part of the swingin' 60's.  This film IS the epitome of the 60's, for sure.

More recent viewings have changed my perspective, however.  Patty Duke is so awful it's painful to watch, even all these years later.  Sharon Tate is so beautiful it's painful to think what might have been.  As for Barbara Parkins - what happened?

Anyway, driving home from the theater that afternoon in 1967 an old man in an old Chevy pulled into my lane, hit my MG in the front fender and knocked me up onto the sidewalk, barely missing a telephone pole.  I will always associate those two things together - that car wreck and ""Valley of the Dolls"".  Kinda ironic.",1144281600,6,1129,4.422330097087379

This is it folks, one of Hollywood's trashiest howlers. The Mt. Everest, the King (Queen) of so bad its fabulous movies,

It's finally here on DVD thanks to Fox.

From the wonderful cheesy theme-song to the over-ripe performances, the incredible camp diologe.the ""can you believe they left that in"" bloopers...devour every frame.

Buy it. Live it. Love it.

This film stands on its own despite a cameo appearance by Miss Jackie Susann (the author of this great story itself). I love this film. Susan Hayward, whose grave I have visited in Carrolton, Georgia, was a superstar so far ahead of her time! This film remains a joy to watch!",1513641600,,376,4.463768115942029
