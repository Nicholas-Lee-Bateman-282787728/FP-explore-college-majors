4466913,5,B004UFE2XM,"Season 1 was great, season 2 had alot of stories that that got pretty silly. A big game hunter that hunts machines? And season 3, went between silly and serious at extremes. Coupled with bad production, seems to everyone's least favorite season. Unless you count season 4(all 3 episodes of it)which American decided to kill the series with the worst story possible. Transformers that left Cybertron during the wars and set up on a new planet and advance their technology. The Headmasters were born. It's that simple, and it's way better than sticking living people inside the Transformers heads. That is done much better in Masterforce (which hopefully sees release from Shout also). Also they do not try to copy american g1 writing. They aren't trying to steal an idiotic invention every other episode, or find some pwoerful artifact just to be abandoned at the end of every episode. The whole season is one long story, like a serial comic pretty much. Where each episode is a chapter, you can't just jump into the middle of the season and start watching. It's gotta start from the start.

Galvatron, fed up with constant failure recruits a couple Headmasters from the Master planet. Fortress Maximus and 4 other Headmasters track them down to stop them and end up joining the Autobots. The tone of the show is a little funny at first but slowly gets more serious and the disasters are of epic proportions. Also Optimus Prime dies along with many other Autobots. Even planets are not spared. We get to watch the death of Galvatron, and Scorponok, the Largest Decepticon headmaster, assume the role of leader. The show gets pretty brutal at times and is probably not for kids.

The animation is way better than American, though the voice acting could use a complete redux. If you can tolerate the voice acting, then you are in the clear to enjoy the series. The score is nothing like what you've heard in the American series. It sounds like MSX Computer Konami music. It actually makes me feel like it is 1987 when I watch it, which is one of the coolest parts of the series for me. When it comes to the Japanese series, I can't decide if I like this or Victory better.",1308528000,5,2169,4.675392670157068
4466914,5,B004UFE2XM,"I saw the horribly dubbed version of these episodes. It's definitely worth a laugh.

With that said, I can say that any Transformers OR NON Transformers fan needs to buy this. It is a must have. There is a lot of history here.

You would take this DVD set to a deserted island if you had to be stranded. The quality of animation is STUNNING and there is more value here than
you could possibly imagine. I don't say that lightly.

If you have any interest in music, film, tv, or video games YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD TODAY. You do not have a choice. There is no guarantee that this will ever
be reprinted. If you pass up this set you will regret it, and you will be unhappy. I can see it now.

5 stars for rarity, history, and social value.

A MUST HAVE.",1306540800,3,749,4.102739726027397
4466915,5,B004UFE2XM,"After all the rumors and promises throughout the years, Shout! Factory is giving the US Transformers fans what the others have never come through on. Glad to see this series is finally getting its long over do region 1 release. I have seen some of the episodes on Youtube and it seems to be a very cool continuation of where the series in the US ended (for whatever reason, rather it was just the declining poularity at the time or the rumors that these episodes were shipped from Japan to be aired in the US but would end up being destroyed in some type of fire. Either way it was ended with the Rebirth (Season 4) series).

Without spoiling too much I thought the concept was just as cool as having the Humannoids as the head and as guns in Rebirth. The only difference is that the these robots are ones who left Cybertron during the Great War to live in peace. While on the planet they picked for their home they designed bigger robot bodies and then they became the heads of those bigger bodies. You will see a lot of new characters as well as some of the older characters from the first three seasons of The Transformers. Like Transformers: The Movie, this series is another transition from earlier characters to the focussing on the newest characters which were the newest toyline at the time.

All in all I have liked what I have seen of the series so far on sites like Youtube and can't wait to get this and see the entire series. With this release and the re-release of Beast Wars I hope Shout! Factory sticks with it and we get a region 1 release of the remaining Japanese series (Masterforce and Vitory for G1, Beast Wars Second and Beast Wars Neo for Beast Wars) as well as the one shot episode for Transfomers: Zone.

I recieved the DVD this week. Shipping was prompt, the only knock I give it is that it was not packaged too great. It was loosely put in an oversized envelope and look like it had been moving around in shipment. It seems Amazon is a little hit or miss anymore with their packing of the items for shipment. Other than that the set was fine, none of the plastic inside or out was broken, no loose DVDs inside and no scratches or anything on the DVDs.

As for the episodes, this is a lot better than finding and watching these on Youtube. The episodes were good to watch and the dialogue seems like it has a little more humor in some spots espcially when watching the antics of Daniel and Wheelie.  I know some consider this the weakest link in the Japanese continuation of the series. To me this is just a very fun start to the Japanese contiuation and a must for any Transformers fan.",1305417600,10,2614,4.359342915811088

4466917,3,B004UFE2XM,"At long last, after nearly two decades of having to suffer through overpriced bootlegs and imports, the U.S. 'Transformers' fan base finally gets a proper release of the Japanese series!

As any online summary will tell you, the Japanese 'Headmasters' ignores the 'Rebirth' mini-series and follows its own take following the events of 'The Return of Optimus Prime' (or Convoy, as he is called in the Japanese series).  Parents of younger 'Transformers' fans may want to be aware that the tone of the series is a tad darker than the U.S. episodes mainly due to character deaths throughout the series (a certain character sacrifices himself AGAIN), and by U.S. standards, there is a substantial amount of profanity.  (NOTE: At the time of this review, I was going by the Japanese and Australian releases, which did feature said profanity in the English subtitles.  Apparently, Shout Factory/Hasbro made sure that these were not in the U.S. release.)

My major gripe with 'Headmasters' is that in general, the writing is very weak and often seems as if it is trying too hard to mimic the previous U.S. 'Generation One' (G1) series.  Even the 'lip syncing' of the characters in early episodes seems as if it is trying to reproduce that of the original English language shows.  Keep in mind that anime of the late 80s was not being marketed as heavily to the western world as it is today.  In that respect, 'Headmasters' curiously comes off as if it were in some ways a half-serious parody of the U.S. shows (such as 'G.I. JOE' and 'Transformers') for which Japanese animation studios had been contracted. (The subsequent series, 'Super God Masterforce' and 'Victory', are stronger for taking their own direction.)

Some characterizations are extremely inconsistent to the original series. For example, Soundwave is extremely 'chatty', and Galvatron is nowhere near as insane as in Season 3.  Also, if you couldn't stand Wheelie and Daniel Witwicky, be warned that they are fairly prominent in this show.  The perk, however, is getting to see familiar characters as well as plenty of new (at the time) ones, as the world of the Transformers was ever-satisfying in creating inventive new robots and their alternative forms.  Also, look for the appearance of the Beastformers (known in the U.S. as 'Battle Beasts').

'Headmasters' is by far considered the weakest of the Japanese 'G1' series.  However, the appeal for U.S. fans is ""the continuing adventures"" of the original G1 cast of characters.  For hardcore fans, this is a must-have.",1303516800,41,2531,5.021531100478469

4466950,4,B004UFE2XM,This show was a lot of fun to watch!  It was kinda silly at times.  I don't like the rule that anime seems to have about having a child stuck in the middle of a giant robot war...  but at least Wheelie didn't speak in rhyming couplets the whole time.,1459123200,,250,3.96

The animation is correct and the characters are likeable, but the story is all over the place and can't seem to focus on anything, There are some episodes who are, also truly confusing.
Why do I like it, though? Because, if you manage to watch it all through, you get to spot GEMS. The most precious one being the backstory of the Japanese Headmasters, which, I think, is one of the most interesting piece of story found in the whole Transformers franchise. For that, this show is a real kicker to anyone invested in Transformers. It can also be appreciated by old time fans or old cartoon afficionados, I think. But I cannot stress enough that it is NOT for the casual viewer as they might be put off by this product of its time that hasn't aged that well.

There's swearing in Japanese. The subtitlers knew they were making something for kids, so in the subtitles, the profanity is rendered in such a way that no one would immediately realize what's being said (""Shimatta!"" becomes ""Oh no!"" for example. ""Kuso!"" becomes ""Scrap!"")  And really, I was impressed by that. I was impressed that overall they cared enough about who their audience was to render it both faithfully and cleanly.

Had I bought this from eBay and not Amazon I would have suspected this to be a Hong Kong Special.

Not really going to comment on the content because it's G1 Transformers: you probably already know if you're going to like it or not.  For the benefit of those who only grew up with the US series, I will say that hearing ""TURANSUFOOOAARRRMU!"" every 3 seconds during a battle scene takes some getting used to.

4466975,2,B004UFE2XM,"A lot of people said that the original Transformers cartoons were nothing more than toy commercials. But as a fan of G1 growing up in the 80's, I always thought the writing was decent and characters were developed with actual personalities. In fact, a lot of those original episodes hold up fairly well today - especially the 1986 movie. But Headmasters is completely void of decent storytelling, and really is nothing more than toy commercials. It takes place 6 years after the movie (2011 - movie took place in 2005), yet Daniel looks exactly the same and is voiced by a girl? He should be 16-18 years old by now. None of the characters have any personality whatsover.

SPOILERS:

Hot Rod keeps running away from fights that lead to other Autobots getting killed (something American Hot Rod would never do). How many battles are fought with Transformers just standing out in the open, shooting at each other without moving? Optimus Prime spends 3 episodes trying to reach Vector Sigma, and then as soon as he does, all of the other Autobots and Decepticons who have been doing other things this entire time, arrive immediately after him? Why didn't it take them 3 episodes to get there too? Prime and Galvatron fight and are blasted by the same energy from Vector Sigma. Galvatron gets up and runs away, but Optimus is dead? Seriously? It's just really awful. Aside from the G1 animation (which I think is still the best of any Tranformers series since), Headmasters has zero redeaming qualities.",1404864000,7,1498,4.8023255813953485

Fleshing out the third and fourth American seasons much better and much more favorably than the lackluster Series 3 and abysmally shortened Series 4, the Headmasters gives us 32 episodes of pure Transformers action.

How much they'll enjoy depends on them, but I'm sure they'll find some good episodes here.  If you haven't seen this, stop reading this since there will be spoilers.  Anyways, Japan decided to start producing their own Transformers shows & made a trilogy, & while the later shows are precisely one third of my top 6 Transformers series, this first one falls to 7th at best.  It's not bad for a first effort, but it isn't as good as the seasons before or after it.  This did give some improvements on the old series like Transformers can be killed on TV (This isn't always a good thing though.  Optimus Prime died again, & Ultra Magnus' death wouldn't get him into silicon Valhalla.), and the cassette animal Transformers can talk now, which is what they should have done in the American series.  The first 5 episodes are good, but after that the series gets a little spotty.  The 2 part stories suck (Cybertron & Mars get destroyed) except for the one that introduced the Targetmasters.  There are about 20 or so decent episodes, with some really good ones that force me to keep the set.  My favorites were Battle to the Death on the Planet Beehive, The Head Formation of Friendship (these 2 were like those awesome season 2/3 episodes where they go to another planet & meet an alien culture), & my favorite of all The Emperor of Destruction Vanishes under an Iceberg (Galvatron dies!  Woohoo!).  There are probably others but I can't think of any right now.  The main problem is that it's the same characters over & over again.  This wasn't bad in Masterforce because it made sense that the cast was that small since they were stuck on Earth for the most part.  Here it spans galaxies but wherever we go it's always the Headmasters fighting each other.  I do really like Fortress Maximus' portrayal here though.  He was a good leader, & the Master Sword is pretty cool.  Whenever he transforms & uses it, it reminds me of Voltron.  But the last episode is ultimately unsatisfying.  Sixshot turns good because of Daniel?  Fortress Maximus is caught in Scorponok's grip & is released by the Autobots holding hands in a circle & channeling their friendship?!  The American shows were never this silly!

Still, like I said, this is a decent set.  All Transfans should try this.  It's hardly the best, but it's not the worst Japanese Transformers show (that would be Beast Wars II, though even that had its moments).  I assure you, Masterforce & Victory (seasons 5 & 6) are much better than this.  Don't believe me?  If you look at their reviews; they consist of nothing but 5 stars review when it comes to the content, except for ones who thought they were getting it in English or other ordering circumstances.",1368921600,,2797,4.607287449392713

Optimus is back in action, if only for a few episodes, and so are some old favorites. With the return of Galvatron, this is a series that you shouldn't miss out on.",1338595200,,544,4.797872340425532
4466989,4,B004UFE2XM,"Transformers: Headmasters is the first part in a loosely tied togethor trilogy of Japanese Transformers cartoons that served as a follow up to the third season of the Generation One cartoon. Instead of airing the three part finale The Rebirth in Japan, Takara decided to branch off and produce it's own series. Headmaster's is the first and is easily recognised as the most in common with the original American cartoon.

The overall story of Headmasters is relatively basic each episode is mostly self contained with an occasional two parter. The Autobots continue the fight against the Decepticons while throughout the narrative new characters are introduced while older characters are phased out. The characterization and writing can vary, where a lot of the plots have a western feel gradually as the new cast becomes more dominant the anime influences in characters begin to show a lot more. I find viewing this with subtitles to actually work better for me when it comes to this, where if I heard this writing in an english cartoon it would probably irritate me to hear so many redundant sentences and repeating of dialog. However when you read it and hear the lines spoken in Japanese it sounds better and actually keeps my attention.
The subtitles are not without errors, occasionally words are mispelled or names are wrong but over all you can see a lot of care was put into the writing. As other reviewers have mentioned dialog is written to match the older cast quite well. Grimlock for example still speaks in his ""Me Grimlock"" attitude. Of note though is where subgroups and minor characters are concerned they sometime go unnamed or get an alternative name. For example the Cassette-bots and Cassette-cons have been given the subgroup name ""Deployers"" which is actually a group from the Beast Machines toyline. The Deployers were beasts who transformed into weapons for the larger figures not unlike Targetmasters. Another example would be the autobot clones Fastlane and Cloudraker who feature prominently in one episode but are never named. Whether this is true in the actual dialog or not I can't be sure as I don't speak Japanese, but as far as subtitles go they are only refered to as ""Autobot Clones"". These are minor complaints as most of these guys are not main characters or are phased out over the course of the show.

The DvD's themselves are of nice quality, the boxart depicts ChromeDome fighting SixShot, both are very prominent in the series and especially in Chromedome's case are very much main characters.
One minor issue is on the episode listings. The inside artwork has the episodes listed according to the disks that they are on, however they are misprinted as each disc has an additional episode from the start of next disc, leaving the list completely wrong by the final disc. It's a minor complaint and doesn't detract at all from the set but it is worth noting if you're like me and don't use the play all function.
The disc Menu's are really well done, nice CGI graphics that enhance the experience with the fantastic theme music from The Headmaster's cartoon running in the background. In the episode menu you're treated to a nice graphic of a 3d wire frame image of a character. What's odd though is not every character is from Headmaster's. For example disc one's menu is of Super Ginrai from Super God Masterforce, but Disc 2 is ChromeDome from Headmasters. I have not yet watched Shout Factory's release of Masterforce but I wouldn't be surprised if the menu system is reused.
Another interesting note is the episodes themselves, during some of them an alternate opening sequence is used where a lot of the Decepticons are shadowed over. I cannot recall why this was done originally but it's neat to see both versions of the credits used.

Overall this is a great value. You get a fantastic rendering of some rare episodes for a very reasonable price, I think a nice fan documentary discussing the differences of the series would've been great, but instead you get a small art gallery. Still for $20 bucks (at least at the time I purchased it) I felt like I was getting more then my money's worth just for the fact that I got a high quality release of a rare series in it's entirety.",1336694400,3,4228,4.796982167352538

The animation is similar to what you remember back in your childhood - choppy.  But the sound effects are the same.  The Japanese actors' voices are not distracting and neither are the English subtitles.  Even though the background music is NOT the same as the 80's mecha-pop, I still consider it a catchy Japanese-disco vibe.  I was a little disappointed with the cartoon plots, but I think I attribute that to the matured taste from exposure to 26 yrs worth of stories.  That's the only reason I gave this collection one star less.

4466995,2,B004UFE2XM,"On the plus side, at long last, the ""real"" conclusion of the Transformers G1 saga is out on DVD.  I remember being sorely disappointed with the three-part season four of the american series.  And then, a few years later, I saw what looked like an episode of a  G1 series with G1 characters, but was otherwise unfamiliar to me, on a spanish channel.

Ever since then, I had been dying to see what ""the real"" fate of the transformers was.  Now it's finally out, and I am, again, very disappointed.............

I mean, it was great to see a lot of familiar characters at it again in the tranformers universe, but as the series went on, I was increasingly disappointed.  I could overlook the lack of extras (they couldn't include profiles all of the characters?) and generally poor video/animation quality.  But there were three things in particular, I didn't like about Transformers: Headmasters.............

1.  The series had an overall depressing tone to it, a lot of tragic events occured during the series.  What's more, these tragedies failed to make for more compelling story-telling (IMHO).  I was more annoyed and let down then moved by said events.  Dark, or darker, is one thing, this was something else.

2.  The series felt more like a japanese anime series than the old Transformers G1 series.  Understandable, considering it was a japanese production company but it didn't really fit with the tranformers vibe (IMHO).  I often forgot I was watching Transformers: Headmasters and would think I was watching starblazers or some other such anime feature.  The series moved from the episodic format of the american series to a saga-driven format much like the Marcross, Yamato and other series.  I didn't feel it really worked.  Again, I'm basically saying that it didn't ""feel"" like the old G1 series in america.

3.  My biggest problem with the series was overt manner in which the Headmasters became the center of the entire transformers universe.  Most other characters were ultimately marginalized and seldom heard from (especially after the first three episodes).  Most of the combiners always showed up in their combiner form almost as if there were no members of the combiner group and only their combined forms (such as Superion, Menasor, Computron, etc) even merited attention (and recognition as warriros) at all.

The Headmasters just show up out of nowhere and in short order end up taking over everything while other characters are written out of the series or outright killed off.  It's as if the writers were saying these are you new favorite transformers whether you like it or not.  The only other group characters that came close to the same level of exposure were sixshot (another ""new"" character) and the trainbots (also new, a combiner group, lamest combiner group ever, IMHO).  I mean Raiden (a train combiner) replaced Sky Lynx as the natural adversary to Predaking?  Sky Lynx could have just as well served the function the trainbots did as a means of mass transit and a suitable foe for predaking..................anyway...............

FYI, be aware, a number of other season three characters (besides Sky Lynx) were omiited as well.  Most notably, Wreck-Gar, the Quintessons, the sweeps, the revived Starscream.  Others, made but a single appearance (autobot triple changers, dinobots, many original G1 characters).  Another curious aspect of this series is the the decepticon triple-changers octane and blitzkrieg seemed to have shifted allianced back to the decpticons.  This might bother some american G1 fans.

I, of course, expected the titular characters would be central to a major plot/sub-plot in the series, but not that they would take over center stage and dominate the entire transformers universe.  Clearly, the producers were pushing sales of the newest members of the toyline, but to a ridiculous degree (IMHO).  I much preferred the episodic nature of the american series (particulary season 1 & 2) and the exposure to a wider range of characters (narrowing down to a central cast didn't work out to well for season 3 either, I never understood that logic).

Obviously, these complaints are based on predujices for the format and style of the original season 1 & 2 of the original G1 series, but I think they are important to point out.  Anyone expecting an extension of the american G1 series will be sorely disappointed.  However, any die-hard transformers fan (especially G1 fans, like me) will want to see it for themselves still.

I only caution that Transformers: Headmasters is a wide departure form the story-telling style of the original american G1 series.",1317427200,14,4621,5.067549668874173

I wish it had the classic background music. All it has is the little sound clip from when then autobot/decipticon symbols switch during scene transitions. The music is way too repetitive and not a lot of variety so it's gets old fast. 2:**spoiler** the main man dies again in the beginning episodes and hot rod gets promoted to you-know-who again... 3:Animation is what you might expect from a fourth season with a smaller budget, again lots of repetition not alot of originality. 4: Springer. If you liked him well, he's got a minor part. He's now referred to as one of the ""triple changers"". The Headmasters are different then in the miniseries at the end of G1 season 3. Finally, the good news. Subtitles are VERY well done, using the American series names and references. In all honestly, that's the sole reason to watch this. And the transformation sounds and weapon sound effects are the same also. It's a long series, and there is way too much narration in place of actual visual story building. But it's more classic transformers so whoo hoo!",1315699200,3,1205,4.7156398104265405

4466999,4,B004UFE2XM,"I grew up with Transformers and just love everything Transformers.  When I was a kid, I would get a few bootleg episodes on VHS with VERY VERY poor dubbing.  It was so goofy sounding that it made the show stupid.  But as a kid, I didn't care, I just wanted to see Scorponok and Sixshot and etc in cartoon form.  Now everyone who hasn't seen the series yet will get the same opportunity.  Whats even better is that these are the original Japanese voices with English subtitles.

I do enjoy the DVD and think they did a good job.  However, the subtitling is hard to read at times because it is in a white font, and I think yellow would have probably worked better.

The series continues after season 3 of the US series, and skips Rebirth.  It's not the best TF series made, but it's good.  Most would agree that Masterforce is the best.  There will be a box set released soon with Masterforce, and Victory along with Headmasters.

The quality of the DVD is fantastic and looks as good as it did when it was broadcasted.  If you are a fan, or just curious about the foreign TF universe, you owe yourself a favor and must pick this up.

I give the series 4 stars out of 5, but Shout! Factory deserves 5 stars for bringing these to the states.",1313712000,3,1238,4.280172413793103
4467000,5,B004UFE2XM,"I have to rate this release as a 5-Star for several reasons:

1. The great price and for the fact that it's not a bootleg.
2. If this is the 'weakest' series of the Japanese ""trilogy"", then I hope Shout Factory releases the other two sets (Headmasters; Super God Masterforce; Victory), the storytelling and action is excellent.
3. Even for an 80's 'toon, and not remastered from its original film, it has held up brilliantly; much moreso than the U.S. counterparts in my opinion.
4. It doesn't belittle: adult wars - check; actual robot destruction/dismemberment and 'game over' - check; extremely mild language (I wouldn't even consider it profanity) - check.

It's basically what you wanted to see as a kid.  I was hesitant to watch the release at first.  It sat on my player for over a month.  Not because it's a Japanese release and has no English Dubs -- I watch all of my anime with Subs, but because it's from the 80's.  Don't get me wrong; I'm crazy about TF G1, mainly the 1st and 2nd seasons.  After re-watching the 3rd and 4th seasons; good grief those did not age well -- the U.S. storytelling for the later seasons is mediocre; some plots and animation made my eyes roll.  It was actually painful to watch; especially the distant planets and the attention focused moreso on the annoying characters (aliens and humans) rather than the robots.

The later U.S. releases remind me of the new live-action films.  Love everything about the robots; highly dislike the annoying human characters (although the 1st movie still remains the most watchable).  However, I don't mind a re-telling.  I don't mind liberties.  I enjoy a little shake-up.

The detail and animation of the Japanese ""Rebirth"" story, to me, is hands above the 4th season of the U.S.  Whereas, in the U.S. cartoon... you might count 10-15 different 'bots; I basically lost count at 40 in the first episode of ""Headmasters"".  I understand cartoons are the main push to sell the latest series of the toyline; but it's nice to see so many older 'bots in the Japanese cartoon.  Also, the tape cassette wars and the amount of combiner 'bots in just the first 5 episodes is outstanding; I was shocked; it made me drivel.  I could not stop watching the series, and the episodes fly by.

The cartoon action usually takes place in several locations and on several planets; there is a great voice-over/subtitles narrater to keep you up to track on the story and the whereabouts of the 'bots -- much more in depth than the U.S. cartoons (which did not take advantage of such tools and storytelling; and watered down adult themes); you'll know what I mean once viewing a few shows.  It is action paced and I'll state it again, the animation and battles are noncomparable.  I instantly wanted to watch the release again, which means an instant 'keeper' and 'winner' in my book.  And I'm very picky.  I wasn't born in the 80's, so I'm not a fan of CG 'toons such as Beast Wars/Machines, Energon, etc.  So I heavily rely on these cel-shaded 'toon releases.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It won't hurt to add to your collection.",1313020800,25,3077,4.683426443202979

When I found out that there was a Japanese series, I was like ""WOW!"". So I went ahead & bought Transformers: Headmasters. First of all, the artwork is impressive. The disc arragement is okay.

My only problem is that you have to rely on the subtitles to know what is being said since the spoken language is all in Japanese. It would have been nice to have an English language selection. Hearing Optimus Prime speaking Japanese, just doesn't sound the same.

Still this isn't a bad addition for the avid Transformers collector. Watching these episodes reminds me of when I had some of the toys of the characters featured in the cartoon.",1311724800,,743,4.66412213740458
4467004,3,B004UFE2XM,"This is pretty decent, all things considered. The show is a little silly, and I still want someone to stomp all over Wheelie and Daniel. Die, ""relate-able"" characters, die.

I should note, however, that the subtitles kind of suck. They're rife with typos, and take massive liberties with certain terms and phrases (""Hai"" does not translate to ""Yes, sir, of course!"" You're taking it too far, subtitlers).

Worth buying, especially at this price, but don't expect to take it too seriously.",1311465600,,488,5.012345679012346
4467005,4,B004UFE2XM,"Transformers: Headmasters is the first of a loose ""trilogy"" of Japanese-exclusive Transformers cartoons produced after the demise of the American ""G1"" cartoon.  I was introduced to this show (and its successors, Transformers: Masterforce and Transformers: Victory) by way of badly-converted (PAL-to-NTSC) VHS bootlegs and an English dub by way of Singapore.  I was able to get into Masterforce and Victory, since the characters were mostly ""all-new"" and had few, if any, connections to the original series, but I could never get more than five or six episodes into Headmasters because of the glaringly horrible way they dealt with the names (Blurr is called ""Wally,"" Blaster is called ""Billy,"" Spike is ""Sparkle,"" the Matrix of Leadership is called ""The Power Pack,"" etc.).  It was laughingly bad and still a subject of much derision today (there's a line in Masterforce about ""going to headQUARters to have some keBABS"" that still makes me chuckle years later).

Shout! Factory's official U.S. release of these cartoons is a blessing by comparison.  Not only do the subtitles reflect the ""correct"" names for the characters, but they opt to use the American names of the characters (Optimus Prime, Kup, Cerebros, Autobots, Decepticons) vs. the Japanese (Convoy, Char, Fortress, Cybertrons, Destrons).  It is easier to get into the story when you're not thinking ""Did they really just call him 'SPARKLE'?!?""  The ""Japanese with English Subtitles"" may turn off the casual viewer, but it's really the only way to watch the show, as the only ""legitimate"" English dub track is absolutely abominable in it's badness.  The story is much broader and more engaging than the three-episode ""Season 4"" although the toy collectors among us may grumble about the cool Japanese-exclusive characters that we never got back in the '80s (the Trainbots, Twincast, Soundblaster, and so forth).  Also be on the look-out for one episode appearance by Hasbro's Battle Beast characters, who were released in Japan as a Transformers tie-in called ""Beastformers"".

While some of the storylines are a bit darker than the American version (i.e., major robot character deaths as early as episode 3), it won't traumatize any child who survived watching the wholesale robo-slaughter in the original ""Transformers: The Movie"" (or the spine-tearing, face-ripping goodness of the live action movies, for that matter).  In fact, those hoping for a ""hardcore and mature Transformers story"" in the vein of ""TFTM"" or the Michael Bay films may walk away a little disappointed.  ""Headmasters"" is completely and unabashedly a kid's show, and a Japanese kid's show at that.  As such, there's much focus on the human POV character, Daniel, and the occasional bits of shtick and slapstick that might turn off the hardcore G1 ""purist,"" but it is overall a good show.

Besides, Blurr's Japanese voice actor is absolutely awesome and certainly evokes the legendary John (FedEx, Micromachines) Moschitta, Jr. in his portrayal.  That and Grimlock's subtitles being in ""Me-Grimlockspeak"" make me a very happy Transfan.

The set is beautifully packaged and affordably priced.  While the extras are a little sparse (an art gallery and nothing else), getting 35 episodes of an anime for $20-$25 is worth the price of admission in and of itself.

The only major complaint I have is that occasionally the timing of the subtitle track will get a little ""off"" and doesn't quite keep up with the dialogue at times.  It happens rarely, but often enough to be noticeable.",1310947200,38,3511,5.2042628774422734
4467006,4,B004UFE2XM,"Years ago, when I was growing up watching the original G1 series on TV, I heard rumors from my friends at school that apparently Transformers continued after ""The Rebirth"" but that it only aired in Japan. I later learned that this was because Transformers was actually an American cartoon that Sunbow did by contracting Japanese animation firms (I believe TOEI was the main one). --(people feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)--. Some episodes were animated by Hanna Barbera also. I believe the american series was also aired in Japan with Japanese voice actors, but after sales of the toys declined in America, they sold the franchise to Takara (?). And then the Japanese took full control of the series from that point on.

So anyway, I HAD seen the first episode of the Japanese series a few years ago (badly translated as ""The Four Soldiers From The Sky""... It was one of those that were dubbed with English (UK) voice actors and it was TERRIBLE !! ... So bad was it that although the quality of the animation was great, I just could not watch more than one episode.

But here I am, having given the show a second chance as this time it's proberly released by SHOUT! Factory (who can be credited for doing an amazing job so far). This time it's presented with the original Japanese audio and a NEW (and proper) translation into english with subtitles. And boy is it surprisingly different...

Now the story is somewhat clearer and a lot of things make more sense to me since I finally understand that when the Japanese did their Headmaster series, they scrapped the American season 4 all together (The Rebirth) and started THEIR story right after the end of season 3 (The Return of Optimus Prime). -- In other words, if you really want to understand what's going on, as a North American fan, you have to pretend The Rebirth never existed (which is all good by me).

I give this product 4 stars not for the product itself (which I would give 5 stars to), but actually because of the lack of vision of executives back in the days who could have (and should have) simply imported the show from Japan and asked Peter Cullen, Frank Welker and company to re-dub the show in ""American""... When you think about it, it would have cost them much less money then producing the show themselves, and it would have boosted their toy sales... (They did it years later for shows like Pokemon)...

All this to say, if you're a fan of G1 Transformers, I REALLY recommend this purchase ! And I hope they don't stop there...",1310428800,2,2509,4.566666666666666
4467007,5,B004UFE2XM,"For those of us that grew up with the original Transformers series this is a long awaited treat! At the end of the 3rd season the public was left with a sappy mix of a series ending. The three episode ending through in lots of new characters (i.e. toys) and a barely there plot. This series is the continuation prior to this terrible ending.

This series picks up after Optimus Prime has come back and saved the world from the ""hate virus"" of previous episodes. Its set in the far distant future of 2011! The Decepticons are back and ready to kick some Autobot butt! This series focuses on the Headmasters as well as the other special combiner teams. For the first time the public gets to see all the combiner teams mixing it up in battle.

The opening and closing credit songs leave a lot to be desired but are basically standard Japanese anime songs. The animation is the same as the original series so that is great for fans. The story writing is bit more adult than the previous series but nothing that would turn off kids. The series is in Japanese but is subtitled.

8441476,2,B004UFE2XM,"If you're a diehard Transformers fan, this is a must have. It brings back nostalgia of the 80s as well as keeps pushing forward the story after the end of season 4 (the very short 3-part mini-series The Rebirth). However, this is a Japanese product, not the American version so there are a lot of differences in story telling, tone, feeling, and overall quality. This is a Japanese product with Japanese voices and English subtitles. There is no English dub just so you know. This is not done by Sunbow Productions like the American version so it is quite obvious they do not look highly on the American version and I'll explain why. I'll try to break this down as much as I can:

1. This occurs 6 years after the events of Transformers: The Movie. Daniel still looks the same age and attitude and is voiced by what sounds like a girl. Eessh, I can get over that.

2. They ignore the events of The Rebirth. They did not like it and decided to reimagine what happens after the events of Season 3.

3. The American version Transformers are there for show, but have little to no importance to the story. Goldbug, formerly Bumblebee, one of  the biggest child favorites in the States, is not even mentioned or shown. Optimus is in the way so they kill him off early in the story, again. Rodimus and Ultra Magnus are there but not nearly as important, some times just a second thought in the action that is ongoing. Springer, is shown a couple of times, never mentioned by name, and is referenced only as  Triple Changer and has no lines. Arcee is there and so is Blurr but Arcee is mostly there for show and the Japaneses Blurr doesn't talk as fast as the Moschitta Blurr and comes across as young and annoying. Blaster and Soundwave both die and are reborn under new names, presumably for selling a new and different products in Japan. Their cassettes go from being noteworthy to invisible after a few episodes. Sky Lynx is not present at all and is replaced by a new set of Japanese combiners called Trainbots. They look horrible. Basically 6 robots that connect to make one very long train with extended compartments, but it flies like Astrotrain or Sky Lynx. It looks utterly ridiculous and completely out of place. Jazz shows up here and there and has lines early on then no lines way later.

4. Oddly, the older American Transformers that cross over do a lot of standing around, speaking here or there, but really aren't ever apart of the action as the series goes along. A classic example of out with the old, in with the new.

5. It has been said on the TFWiki and is true that this version starts off taking the story and focusing on the Headmasters and Trainbots. These are the hot toy items that they were wanting to push to little boys of Japan back then so they get all of the focus. It becomes obvious that the American imports are not highly thought of and slowly phased out to the Japanese brand of Transformers they were pushing at the time.

6. As far as the enemies, yes, the Decepticon Headmasters get most of the screen time along with SixShot, a six-changer Decepticon. Galvatron is there and just as unruly, temperamental, and stubborn as the American version. SixShot is a good new addition and is impressed. The Predacons are there but not nearly as intimidating as their bios make them out to be or how they are in the comics or American version. The emphasis here are the Headmasters and Terrorcons with heavy doses of  SixShot and Soundblaster (Soundwave reborn). Galvatron takes a lesser role compared to the American version and Cyclonus and Scourge are more the patsy other troops that get beat up on like Thundercracker, Skywarp, Dirge, Ramjet, and Thrust were in G1.

7. Eventually Rodimus disappears after a major event and leaves the Autobot leadership to Cerebros, the leader of the Headmasters (go figure). The main Japanese products, the Headmasters and Trainbots head off into space to search for the Decepticons so they leave the American Transformers (Blurr + Ultra Magnus who all pretty much disappear or die) on Earth. The focus becomes space bound from there. Arcee tags along but is mostly for show. Weird thing is Daniel joins the Headmasters and splits from his parents. At no point would anyone believe a parent would endanger their children but they do a great job of that in this show (most asinine).

8. The feel and tone of this Japanese collection reflects the mood, attitude, and design of the Japanese culture. Brave, bold, daring in the face of danger, and a strong emphasis on fighting with honor. There is literally one episode where the Trainbots wish to defend Japan because they claim it is where they were born, no joke. Not born millions of years ago on Cybertron or some other settlement, but in Japan and apparently pretty recently considering the history of the Transformers so they have a sense of devotion to their homeland. I just wasn't used to that kind of thing with the American version where all Transformers were Cybertronian born and merely took some form of vehicle on earth, but their ""spark"" did not originate in any particular country. Even the Dinobots were Cybertronian scouts and took forms of dinosaurs once on Earth.

9. Yeah it wreaks of cultural favoritism but I can get over that. It's their product, their story, so why not?

10. Once I get over that, the subtitled dialog is a bit wordy, clunky, and not always funny or cute. A lot of cases it's forward, blunt, and argumentative between each other. They do a lot of talking in dumbed down kid ways that makes you want to roll your eyes big time. American Transformers did that some, but not to this extent.

11. Graphics and animation take a big step back from Season 3 and it feels more like Season 1.

12. There is narration in the middle and at the end of episodes that weren't always in the American version where the narrator is literally talking to one of the characters instead of narrating to the listener. It's different but gives it a look and feel of a soap opera in that sense.

Some times these episodes draw you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. The main reason is because it's not anything you remember seeing from the American version so the novelty helps with the draw. However, some episodes, feel like other episodes, just penned differently. They some times even feel like former American episodes so you may find yourself waiting for the episode to end.

As I said, as detailed as I am trying to be, I thought it was ok and worth the purchase for the price. I would NOT buy it for more than $20 if ever there is a price point that high or higher.",1483574400,11,6623,4.575527426160337
