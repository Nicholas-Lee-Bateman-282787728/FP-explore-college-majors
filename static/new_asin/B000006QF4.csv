First under his given name of Creighton Tull Chaney--then under studio pressure and the pressures of trying to feed a family--changing his name to Lon Chaney Jr.

Of course, his first big break came as Lennie in ""Of Mice and Men""--first on the stage, then in the great film version. Not too long afterwards, Lon found his way to Universal Pictures--and after making a quick programmer called ""Man Made Monster"", Universal put Lon into a little vehicle titled ""The Wolf Man""--which would cement his legacy as one of the all time horror greats.

But Lon probably longed for more than just being a ""horror"" great or trying to be another man of a 1000 faces and he couldn't seem to escape the alcohol demon or the shadow of his legendary father.

In his later years, the ravages of alcohol had taken their toll & I admit to getting a little emotional watching Lon during that stage of his life as did his grandson Ron Chaney remembering his grandfather during those final days.

But hopefully--wherever he is now--Chaney Jr. is at peace & can take comfort in the fact that he too left behind a great legacy under the name ""Lon Chaney"" and the films that he made during his prime years at Universal is how I will always choose to remember him and hopefully some day, some film historian will get around to writing the first great book about the life and times of Lon--such a project has been long overdue.

RIP Lon, and thanks for the great thrills and chills your movies still provide for generations to come.",1393977600,,1705,4.5227272727272725
7904718,5,B000006QF4,"This video on Lon Chaney Jr. flowed along excellently, showing his tough childhood years being on the road with his vaudeville parents, stepping out from his father's shadow into acting and reluctantly changing his name to Lon Jr., his lean years in the 1930s, success and stardom in the 1940s with The Wolfman and other Universal horror roles, to his television roles and C grade movies from the 1950s and 1960s.
Former co-stars and his grandson share a lot of intimate looks at Chaney, which portrayed him as a caring, gentle man who was great to work with, despite the alcohol demon that possessed him throughout most of his adult life.
The transition of showing Lon Sr.'s career and how Creighton stepped into acting and changed his name to Lon Jr. for publicity purposes was nicely done. We see clips of Lon from 1930s westerns, his move into horror roles, and then his character roles throughout the rest of his career, both in movies and on TV.
Besides his Wolfman role and other Universal starring roles, the biography focused strongly on his role as Lenny in ""Of Mice and Men."" Chaney was playing Lenny in the Broadway version, and when the film version was announced, Broderick Crawford was to play the part. Chaney was so into the role that he boldly went to the producers and asked to be screen tested against the other actors in the movie, particularly a youthful Burgess Meredith. Chaney was so overwhelming, that he was recast into the part.
As much as he loved the role of Lawrence Talbot and the Wolfman, he equally hated the role of Kharis the mummy, which he played three times. The makeup was very grueling and took eight hours to do an entire body workover. In many cases, only Chaney's top portion was made up for closeups, and at long-distance shots, he wore a mask instead of the total face makeup, saving a lot of time.
Of course, the down side is shown too, and his grandson discussed the problems with alcohol. Two sad moments are shown. In 1951, he is doing a live television broadcast of the Frankenstein story, and he is playing the monster. Chaney was drunk and thought that it was just a dress rehearsal. He didn't know the broadcast was live, and during scenes that called for him to go into a rage and smash furniture as he chased people through a huge mansion, he would only pick the furniture up and then set it back down, just going through the motions. This incident put him in the doghouse with movie producers and placed him on the Hollywood B list for pretty much the rest of his career.
The other sad incident shows a clip from Chaney's last pitiful role in Dracula versus Frankenstein. He was gravely ill at the time, and his face and body are badly swollen from the ravages of alcohol. He was also in the early stages of battling throat cancer and would die only two years later. Following this clip, a few shots are shown of him in his later years, baggy eyed and obviously tired and worn out.
However, the biography ends on a positive note showing the legacy of universal monsters being preserved at Universal Studios and the fact that Chaney's movies are watched as much as anyone's. A tribute to a man who was a much better actor than he was given credit for.",985219200,8,3207,4.559792027729636
