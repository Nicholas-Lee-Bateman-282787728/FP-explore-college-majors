8372991,1,B002LFPBG0,"Firstly, the title of this DVD is misleading. The documentary is not about steam locomotives, but about the history of the German railways from 1919 to 1945 (not 1939 as is stated on the slick). That the motive power at the time was steam is almost irrelevant in this poorly produced doco. It is difficult to know where to begin in pointing out the many faults in this stumbling film. The director of the famous Verkehrsmuseum in Nuremburg, Dr Rainer Mertens, appears throughout the doco speaking in front of a large photo of a bombed out railway station. Not an encouraging image. The English version has been carelessly handled, with many hilarious translations throughout. For example, gauge is continually pronounced as gorge. All this could have been corrected by anybody with a simple understanding of English.

Worse, in a film with this title, we only get tantalizing glimpses of German steam locomotives, and the historical footage is appallingly copied. This shoddy film is a frustrating waste of time for anybody with an interest in railways, let alone steam railways. The Nuremberg Transport Museum should demand this film be withdrawn as soon as possible. It does them no favours.",1310428800,4,1193,5.025252525252525
