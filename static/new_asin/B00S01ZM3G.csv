8696686,5,B00S01ZM3G,Blu-ray as it should be.  Finished watching first season.  Picture is clear and sharp.  No issues because of the age of the original.  Will definitely order additional seasons as they are released.  Very happy with this purchase.,1484956800,,229,5.081081081081081
8696687,5,B00S01ZM3G,I watched this series for the first time a couple years ago and took an immediate liking to it. This arrived in perfect condition and pretty quick too. I thought this season was really funny and I knew I just had to buy it. I've always liked Don Johnson as an actor and Cheech Marin is hilarious! The two of them are fantastic in this series. I can't wait to get the second season.,1482451200,,381,4.162162162162162

8696692,3,B00S01ZM3G,"I loved the original series and was looking forward to fun nostalgia.  I still like the characters, setting and story lines.  It's also fun to see the range of guest stars that crop up along the way.  Unfortunately the transfer needs to be updated as it is dark and color and contrast are poor.",1441843200,,294,4.407407407407407
