2625927,2,B000H4JH44,"my daughter loves these movies, and now that she's 21 months still enjoys watching them.  But I have to say that this one is a little dull, I like the consept but it lacks new material, and she won't watch it.  I guess if you have a little guy that isn't walking or moving around this might be nice, otherwise you might be better off turning on the radio and saving some money on this one.",1162512000,,389,4.105263157894737

2625935,5,B000H4JH44,"The first time I watched it I was upset as everything was so slow moving.  Lots of blank screens.  Then started watching it with my twin granddaughters!  They were enthralled!  They are now 2 and all they want is ""Einstein"" as they call the DVD.  When the giraffe is reaching for the Banana they are reaching right along with him.  We talk about how nice the giraffe is to help the monkey!  I would tell everyone this DVD should be on their MUST HAVE LIST!",1405987200,,456,4.294117647058823

2625939,5,B000H4JH44,My baby was 3 months when I got this for her.. even though too young to understand things she smiled occasionally at the dvd.. I think she'll really enjoy it in a few months! It's not too long but it also allows for repeat play so you can keep baby entertained if you're busy around the house and forget to hit play again,1373760000,,321,4.111111111111111

2625947,2,B000H4JH44,"My daughter loves the Baby Einstein DVD's, so I got this one for her for Christmas.  Compared to the other ones, it's a bit slow and boring.  I thought there would be more fun movement shown (such as dancing), but it's geared more towards smaller babies (sitting up, crawling, etc.).",1358035200,,283,4.64
2625948,5,B000H4JH44,"I odered this dvd because my daughter is amazed my the tv. I figured she could learn while watching. She loves seeing the babys laugh,clap, and kick on the screen. If your children are anything like my daughter, they will love this movie.

my husbands response? ""well this movie wasn't hard to make!"" doesn't matter.... i would have paid 4x the amount for a bit of a break it gives me!  would def recommend it!",1350172800,2,598,3.9833333333333334

2625961,3,B000H4JH44,"I purchased this DVD for my 4month old after realizing how much she loved watching ""baby Mozart"" her first Baby Einstein video. This next purchase was age appropriate but she didn't like it much I think because it didn't have as much music envovled. I considered it avg purchase because mid way through the dvd it skips. Price was great, delivery great, quality average.",1296864000,,370,4.796875
2625962,5,B000H4JH44,This product is a great tool for baby!! I highly recommend it.  I bought it for my granddaughter and she was mesmerized by it.,1279497600,,126,4.25
2625963,4,B000H4JH44,The picture advertised is not the same as the one on the cover.  The advertised picture reads that the video is for 3 months and up but when I received the video it had a different picture and it read for 12 months and up.  Both videos read Baby's First Moves.  I did purchase this from a separate seller but they told me that someone had uploaded an incorrect picture.  They told me to read the description carefully for the age range but I didn't see it stated there either.  My baby is almost 3 months so I was worried that she wouldn't be ready yet for something for a 12 month old but she loves it!  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  I took one star away for false advertisement.  I plan on ordering her more of these videos but hope this doesn't happen again.,1275004800,2,763,4.108108108108108
2625964,5,B000H4JH44,It's a good source for entertain my 7 month old baby girl. She really enjoys watching other babies do some movements,1271116800,,116,4.571428571428571
2625965,5,B000H4JH44,"This video was a gift for my 5 month old. He goes completely nuts watching it, what a riot. He laughs, babbles, shouts, and snorts at it. I also love that its educational for him, learning how to mimic a lot of the developmental milestones for his age - reaching, rolling, etc...",1270684800,,279,4.384615384615385
2625966,1,B000H4JH44,"This video is a disappointment. I see little value in this video.  Odd puppets, speech, and other representations are used.  The concepts are not clear.  I would never try to teach my child in this way and if I am going to play a dvd will not waste his precious brain development with this.  I'm sorry my sister wasted her money on this gift.",1252195200,,342,4.296875
2625977,5,B000H4JH44,This is my son's favorite and only movie that he will watch. I've played it for him since he was 3 months old and now he is 15 months old and is still mesmerized by it.,1244851200,,168,3.6944444444444446
2625978,3,B000H4JH44,The DVD cover states this is for babies 3mo+. My daughter is 3 mo and pays no attention to this whatsoever. Babies at 3mo are interested in watching the moving toy parts or the bright colors move around on the tv screen. Maybe this would be a good DVD for babies that are getting ready to crawl at the very youngest.,1241308800,4,316,4.19672131147541
2625979,4,B000H4JH44,"My son loves this DVD!! This movie has a ""repeat play"" option that is wonderful. He is so amazed by all fo the baby einstein dvd's.",1240272000,,131,4.076923076923077

2625981,5,B000H4JH44,"My daughter has loved this video since she was about 3 months old.  Now at 11 months, it is still one of her favorites. It has been a great help to me as a Mom and is a positive way to educate baby.  I recommend this video in particular to all new Moms and the series are well done.  My daughter definitely prefers Baby Einstein over anything else and so do I.",1231891200,,360,3.9722222222222223
2625982,5,B000H4JH44,"This was my daughter's first Baby Einstein Video & it's still by far her fav. She started watching it when she was a little over 2 mths. and now is a little over 7 mths. and still loves it! She smiles and laughs when I put it on. Also I noticed compared to other BE videos this one seems to have better special features & more ways to ""interact"" w/ your child if you choose to. & just for the record I am reading some other reviews who claim that children watching videos causes autism and I really disagree. I worked w. autistic children for awhile & in all my training that never came up as an issue or a cause, in fact one girl I worked w/ lived for watching videos on the computer and it helped to learn proper social behavior to use watching the videos or using the computer as a motivator. & there were other kids who had no interest in watching videos whatsoever and probably never had. So anyway not sure where this idea came from but just wanted to add my two cents. That aside, I will just say once again this is a great video, I recommend if you are new to Baby Einstein to start w/ this & Baby Mozart.",1228176000,,1113,4.110091743119266
2625983,5,B000H4JH44,My 5 month old son loves this video.  He recognizes all the characters at this point and gets excited when I put this on.  Plus it gives me a half hour to get other things done while he is transfixed!,1226534400,,200,3.975
2625984,5,B000H4JH44,My daughter has been addicted to this video since she has been 4 months old.  It is the only Baby Einstein DVD that she would watch from the beginning to the end without becoming distracted.  To this day (she is almost 16 mo old) she will sit down and watch it and do the actions with the babies on the DVD.  I think she likes this video because it uses babies throughout the DVD and not just puppets.  I would recommend this DVD to any parent with a young baby.  She learned to clap with the video and she reached with the video.  It was neat to watch her try to interact with the kids.  I would sit with her and watch it and encourage her to make the same movements.,1217116800,,668,4.0534351145038165
2625985,1,B000H4JH44,"My daughter got this video at the age of 12 months.
She was, and still now at the age of two, still frighten of this video. Everytime i put it on she runs out the room and starts crying. If i even say ""Baby's First Moves"" she starts saying ""No"" and leaves the room. I cannot find a reason why she isn't in love with this particular video. I am a collector of Baby Einstein and my daughter has been watching it since she was 3 months. This is the only video she does not like to watch. She can not wait for Einstein Pals to come out. Hopefully, this will be a hit.",1212624000,3,563,3.9473684210526314
2625986,4,B000H4JH44,It took a bit longer for my daughter to appreciate this particular video -- about 6 months. When she started to become more interested in other people and babies she loved this one. She really enjoys watching the other babies in the program.  I would recommend this one for a baby that has shown an interest in watching others.,1202169600,,327,4.5423728813559325
2626007,3,B000H4JH44,"The very first Baby Einsteins were the best.  This is pre-Disney.  Now that Disney owns the rights, there has been alot of computer graphics and over stimulation that the original movies did not have.  I will not be buying any more of these because of repetition and because they are losing the quality that made them great.",1197072000,2,324,4.649122807017544
2626008,5,B000H4JH44,My daughter is pretty young but she sure loves this DVD. She enjoys it too much. We plan to use baby signs in a near future and I know this has been helpful,1194307200,,156,3.757575757575758
2626009,5,B000H4JH44,"My little girl loves watching other babies and kids. This DVD really gets her interest. We clap when they clap and other things, she is so into it. She is 8 1/2 months old and still loves it. It also has some puppets which she loves too.",1188777600,,237,4.0638297872340425
2626010,5,B000H4JH44,"This movie is wonderful for little ones!  Mine was about 9 months old when we got it, and now at age 17 months he is so familiar with it he is doing all the moves right along with the movie!  The language is geared just right as well.  I'm making this part of all my baby shower gifts from now on!",1188691200,,297,3.8360655737704916
2626011,1,B000H4JH44,"Especially for a DISNEY product, the production quality is extremely low.  You can see lint on the black felt background.  You can see a 'black box' behind images that were probably put together computerized... the kids are kicking a ball, and when the ball gets away from them, you realize the kids are playing around on a platform...  my kid will watch it..but, I prefer to show a Sesame Street video...",1182556800,6,405,4.676056338028169
2626012,5,B000H4JH44,"My daughter wasn't interested in this as early on as some of the other Baby Einstein videos, but she does love it now!

We purchased it when she was 10 months old and were not sure of the age appropriateness, but were thrilled to find that it was perfect for her then and she still loves it two months later. She has demonstrated some of actions she has learned from watching the video. It is clearly her favorite and it holds her attention for the full length of the video. She starts clapping as soon as it begins. We have tried other educational programming for infant/toddlers, but Baby Einstein videos are the only videos that hold her attention.",1178409600,,621,4.553571428571429

She loves seeing all the babies that is her favorite part, she also likes the narrator's voice as she say's the moves.  I think alot has to do with the fact that my daughter is our first child and she is not around babies or kids so to see them makes her happy. So if your baby shows intrest in other kids this is the one for you.",1178150400,,434,3.9204545454545454
2626027,5,B000H4JH44,"We have every Einstein that has come out, but by far this one is my daughters favorite.  Maybe because there are other children in the movie and she is an only child.

I have bought several copies to give to all of our friends.",1175904000,3,346,4.196969696969697

2626033,5,B000H4JH44,I do give this dvd 5 stars it is my daughters favorite.  After watching it acouple times she does peek a boo and rocking and giving kisses.  I do these things w/my daughter but I think from her watching other children do this it is more interesting for her.  I am a SAHM and she is not around children often so this dvd helps her watch other children her age.,1168214400,8,359,4.1
2626034,5,B000H4JH44,"This was a Christmas gift from Santa to my son (7 mos) and myself this year and we've reviewed it a few times and so far it has been educational for both of us. This video exposes infants to basic first moves such has, sitting up, crawling, reaching, etc and to toddlers to basic movements such has, walking and kicking. There are plenty of delightful puppet shows either demonstrating the movement or just to provide something to catch the attention of the viewer (since babies typically have short attention spans...well at least my son does). This particular video features a lot of baby clips with babies aged from 6mos-24mos demonstrating the movements at age appropriateness. My son isn't one for mimicking, so far as I can tell, but it does hold his attention fairly well and he does best when I watch it and do the featured movements with him. There are language features for this video allowing you to watch it in English, Spanish, and French which has been great for us since I speak broken spanish and so far my son does recognize such words as comida (food) and sientate (sit) so in one hand it is a reinforcer for him and a teaching tool for myself as I had forgotten many of the verbs used in reference to baby movement such as camina (walk). Also, in the bonus features there is a short clip with a pilates instructor directed towards mothers to teach us busy women how to get some excercise and playtime in with our children, for this reason alone I would recommend it...it is, however, only like 10 minutes long and only gives you about 10 tips but those 10 tips to someone like myself can be a lifesaver (I didn't know how to properly pick up a carrier with a baby in it before I saw this!). I highly recommend this video for the obvious reasons but if it doesn't sound like something for you don't get it because from what I can tell, you either hate it or you love it.",1167177600,20,1888,4.42816091954023
2626035,4,B000H4JH44,"Babies love to imitate. Our 11 month old looks at the video with images of other kids crawling, standing up, walking and clapping.  That type of reinforcement will help him figure out how to walk on his own in the near future.  If nothing else it occupies him for 30 minutes...but we really think he is processing what he sees and will imitate the babies in the DVD and thus be walking on his own very soon.",1166832000,3,407,4.2727272727272725
