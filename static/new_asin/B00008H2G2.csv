7984349,5,B00008H2G2,"This Dvd most likely has most of the Baby saga.  The main thing that happens in this saga is Goku reaching Super Saiyan 4.  Also Goku using ten times kamehameha also is pretty awesome.  I like this story because Baby was so close to winning with him making everyone turn against the good guys.  There are great fighting scenes in this saga too.  I would have to say though that the end of the dark star dragon saga was better.  With Goku and Vegita fusing as SSJ4's.  Overall, Baby saga is great, great story of baby making his way to earth and escaping Dr. Myu's lab just before it being destroyed.  Pan also helps alot in this saga too, but she is a terrible fighter in the whole series.  So I reccomend this saga very very much!!",1055289600,2,732,4.2846715328467155
