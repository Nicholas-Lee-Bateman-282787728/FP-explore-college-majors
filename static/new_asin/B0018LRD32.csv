3646499,5,B0018LRD32,"The pictured item is a 1987 VESTRON videotape. I've always found this brand to be of the finest quality, reliably trouble-free and long-lasting. This one's a full screen dub of a b&w monophonic film.

STAGECOACH was John Wayne's 80th film. In retrospect, the previous 79, mostly 'B' grade programmers, give no indication of this journeyman actor's box office potential. It took John Ford to recognize Wayne's natural talent and charisma and capture them on-screen. His faith in Duke was rewarded, and the masterpiece they and a sterling cast created elevated the western from Saturday matinee fare to an art form revered around the world.

It's a complete work, a brilliant amalgam of action, romance, comedy and melodrama, with Duke spot-on perfect as the Ringo Kid. The story is simultaneously confined to a small coach or a cramped way station and as wide as the magnficence of Arizona's Monument Valley.

Highest possible recommendation!

8310452,3,B0018LRD32,"Stagecoach, 1939 film

The film opens on a road in the southwest. Two riders gallop into an Army post. The Apaches are on the warpath, led by Geronimo. [No reason given.] The coach stops to change their six horses. The conversation introduces the characters. ""What's good for the banks is good for the country."" [Does the banker resemble President Harding?] Dallas is driven out of town by the good women to avoid a calamity. Doc Boone hasn't done well. Cavalry escorts the stagecoach to guard against attack. The banker hops aboard. Johnny Ringo hitches a ride. They proceed through Monument Valley. Shall they continue without a cavalry escort? They take a vote. ""What difference does it make?"" Seating at the table shows their status.

The banker spouts political slogans that are still relevant (and wrong) today. They take a detour north for safety and learn bad news. Mrs. Mallory faints and needs medical attention. ""It's a baby!"" Ringo must carry on the family feud. We learn more about the people and their concerns. [Too sentimental?] Smoke on the mountain sends a signal. The stress affects the people. The next stop reveals a burned house and ferry. They get across the stream and continue. An arrow announces the Apache attack, the chase begins. [That wasn't much of an ambush! Would the clever Apaches attack in the open?] Will the cavalry arrive in the nick of time? The survivors arrive in town. ""Johnny Ringo is in town."" Luke's hand had aces and eights. The telegraph was repaired and the Sheriff greets banker Gatewood.

Ringo is given his ten minutes. The men in the bar await the news. Three men look for Ringo in the dark. Shots are heard, a woman screams. Ringo returns to the Marshal, and meets Dallas again. There is a surprise for a happy ending. The film reflects the culture of that era and hasn't aged bacly. Ringo had knocked around enough to know what Dallas was and wouldn't care anyway. [Too sentimental?]

Ernest Haycox wrote many popular Western novels, some adapted to films. This is a story of clichs about a group of people who are thrown together, face a peril, and live through it. How did it compare to the other western movies from that era? Few have survived to be placed on tape or disc. Was it more censored in some respects and less in others? I wonder if remakes of this movie will drop the banker and pregnant wife due to cultural changes. John Wayne played in many westerns before this film.",1506902400,,2440,4.707259953161593
