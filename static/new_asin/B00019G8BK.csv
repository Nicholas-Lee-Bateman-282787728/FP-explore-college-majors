8008788,5,B00019G8BK,"this is a great start to learning about Marc Chagall, his artwork is vivid and dreamlike and yet filled with (from my point of view) history and pride of a people under attack in the 20th century. it is all so different. i wish there was another dvd twice as long to really get to know this artist and the times he lived in. i have copies of art magazines with stories of Chagall at the end of his life, this dvd is about his famous years, when he was new and still fighting the Germans and the Russians change after communism. i get so caught up looking at his paintings, like Matisse it is my soul that sees these works of art.",1361577600,,629,4.121951219512195
8008789,4,B00019G8BK,"Faster and easier introduction than reading a monograph.  This documentary presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is very detailed, competent, and comprehensive. It includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional painting analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good.",1196640000,9,399,5.65
8008790,2,B00019G8BK,"This work teaches the viewer about the anti-Semitic discrimination that Chagall and his family faced in Russia.  It speaks of how his work differed from the surreal art of Western Europe.  It even proved that no all of his work, especially earlier productions, were surreal.

Still, this was a somewhat dull art lecture just put on a DVD.  I think high school art students would not pay attention to it if their teachers spent a class period showing it.  Most viewers will not want to sit through slide after slide and hear babble after babble.  This may only be for hardcore Chagall fans or those who want to learn more about a potential idol.",1173830400,6,644,4.605263157894737
