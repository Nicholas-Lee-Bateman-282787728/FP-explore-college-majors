8136922,5,B000H68SS8,"Aaron Sorenson's HANK WILLIAMS FIRST NATION pulls you close to its characters like a hearth fire on a cold evening. The film unfolds slowly, as we get to know the people and life in the community. The film, centered on life, family and friendship, is real, amusing, touching, beautiful. See it with people you care about.",1471651200,,321,4.75
8136923,4,B000H68SS8,"I heard about this movie from family members who still live in the Peace River country. Is has a scene shot in the cafe in the little town where I grew up, Nampa, and ariel scenes of the Mighty Peace River. It tells an odd story of a native family, and beautifully portrays their way of life on the reservation, and touches on the struggles they face. It got a little melodramatic at the very end, but the story was so warm and family is so important, it is easily overlooked, especially with the added humor. If you are interested in Native Canadian life this is a great introduction. I loved it!",1430611200,,597,4.339285714285714
8136924,5,B000H68SS8,"Aaron Sorensen's HANK WILLIAMS FIRST NATION is, above all, a heart-warming, touching film featuring fine performances and characters who we come to care about. It is entirely overlooked and never made it to the US beyond the festival network. No explosions, no violence, gratuitous or otherwise, and no sex (I have nothing against sex in films, yet the industry so rarely portrays sex realistically) -- and all heart with an incredible soundtrack and some humorous scenes. Maybe hard to find, but worth purchasing. I have seen it 4 or 5 times and will see it again!",1424044800,,565,4.895833333333333
8136925,4,B000H68SS8,"""Hank Williams First Nation"" is solid movie.  At times the acting for minor characters is jarringly amateurish which is what precludes a higher rating.  Still, this amateurish acting lends a bit of charm to the film so it's not all bad. Without ever becoming heavy handed the film explores the interconnected issues of colonialism and social dysfunction (notably the scene with the social worker and the poem read at the end).  The film moves slowly and does a good job of establishing the setting, which is where much of the pleasure of the film comes from.  Not a lot happens in the film's plot and instead the film is driven by the exploration of a milieu rarely depicted on screen.  As one would hope with a film by this title the soundtrack is excellent.",1184544000,2,759,4.634328358208955
8136926,5,B000H68SS8,"A lot of movies dealing with Native Americans (or, as they are called in Canada, First Nations people) claim to be a realistic portrayal of those people.  Nothing out of Hollywood comes even close to the realism of this modern-day Indian movie.  There is a bit of a story in this movie, but that pales in importance when compared to the feeling this movie gives that you could really know those people.  The movie touches, in a respectful, yet often amusing way, on many social issues common among First Nations people.  For example, one boy is trying to raise money for a Middle Age Activity Center -  the reserve has activities for the kids, and facilities for the old folks, so he decided they needed something to keep the middle age people active so they wouldn't go to the bars!

I guarantee that the vast majority of Americans or Canadians will come away from viewing this movie with a much better understanding of First Nations people.  There is a lot of genuine humor in this movie - no slapstick or crude humor.  It touches on the kids in school, belief in God, illegitimacy, death and hope for the future.  For those wishing to see First Nations people as they really are, especially when kept away from the bars, there is no better movie to watch.  To make the movie even better, there is no bad language at all; nor any questionable behavior shown.  I have over 2,000 movies dealing with kids, and this comes in within the top ten for its authentic depiction of Native American families.  Many people have seen Gordon Totoosis in many Indian movies, but he has never been better than in this movie.  Stscy Da Silva does an Oscar level performance in the last scene, which last amazingly long.",1169510400,3,1704,4.584158415841584
8136927,4,B000H68SS8,"I loved this movie. I was lucky enough to catch it at the Port Townsend(WA) Film Festival, where it was wildly popular, and charmed everyone who saw it. It's a tale of an old man going on a journey--accompanied by a teenage boy--but it's also the tale of a small town, and the interactions of the people there. A very few familiar faces, plus a number of very talented unknowns, all work together for a film that will leave you smiling. I would give a lot for a copy of this film--if you ever get a chance to see it, do so! You won't regret it.",1165536000,,544,4.1415094339622645
