781330,5,6304109717,"It would be much like this. I'm sure alot of people will think I'm an idiot for enjoying film, but I do not care. This has all the action of a great movie, complete with some comody. Wolfson's high-fiber bran and crapping his pants as Shale choked him was one of the more hilarious moments. And the way he kills Rolay at the end by smashing his nose into his face with his hand is something you have to rewind the tape and watch over to see clearly and completely. The class and school fit every stereo type of the at risk ""gangsta"" sorts. Rap, graffiti, attitudes, and attire make it so overblown it can almost make you laugh, at least if you like this sort of film. If not, go rent 187 and see a more serious version of the teacher-student war. It is such a shame that the sequal was rather a letdown.",974160000,3,803,4.187096774193549
781331,4,6304109717,"This formula action film starts with the ho-hum premise of a CIA man Berenger undergoing the task of becoming a substitute teacher in a tough school, where he wonderfully repays the thuggish students in kind. After that, the plot takes a turn for the ludicrous as he uncovers a drug operation and smashes a posse of gangbangers. Strictly for action junkies, though the gun battles and fist fights have a sharper edge than usual. The treatment is fairly realistic as well, and, as one reviewer has pointed out below, the embarrassing PC treatment, which constantly rears its head into almost every film nowadays, is largely absent here. Tom Berenger convinces as the agent-cum-educator with a highly heterodox approach to school discipline. An entertaining actioner of quite some appeal.",969667200,7,786,5.1484375

781407,3,6304109717,"The acting by Tom Berenger is quite good and outdoor scenes showing Miami beach are quite inviting, but the story's plot quickly goes from focusing on an inner-city school to a full-blown action flick that defies the impossible.  I understand this movie is over 21 years old and drugs were a problem in inner schools.  Some things don't change: now we have an opioid problem.

The character development of the principal is well done, but some of the tactics the Substitute uses to clean the school of drug dealers is a bit over the top, but that's what action flicks are all about; action without substance.",1492128000,,607,4.7075471698113205

781410,4,6304109717,"Much better than I expected! Love the character development (in Shale and some of the kids), though I'm not really big on gunfights- unless they're part of The Walking Dead.  But without the fight, this flick wouldn't have been nicely tied up.",1491004800,,243,4.785714285714286
781411,5,6304109717,"We are not in Citizen Kane territory with this one, but it is a cult classic that has a lot to say about the sad state of affairs for students and teachers in public schools that are in disadvantaged neighborhoods, even if it's said in an over the top way. It's not a documentary. Tom Berenger is one of my favorites and he is so good at playing the tough guy with a heart. Where is Diane Verona? Such a great actress and the chemistry between her and Berenger is delicious. Always good to see Luis Guzman and Ernie Hudson in any movie, along with a very young Marc Anthony (no singing in this one). Very hip  Hip-Hop soundtrack. Even though I also dig Treat Williams, the sequels are like most sequels: not as good as the original.",1490400000,4,732,4.304347826086956
781412,3,6304109717,"Good or bad, no way this movie could be made now. White man shows to save black children from evil Latino and black drug dealer gangsters while kicking the back principal's drug slinging butt? No way. Too many stereotypes.

Unfortunately unless you grew up in the ghetto of any kind (Hispanic,Black or otherwise) you would never realize how afraid the teachers where. The setting was during a time where big drug dealers where infiltrating the schools to grow there business, really happened.
Movies tend to glamorize this, however in this movie it's as close to real as I've seen.
I lived in a ghetto in the late 60's and seventies and it was horrible beyond imagination.

Yes he has done a few straight to video films with awful performances but this is done by a few actors to pay the bills or wrong casting, I first saw this film on video years ago and it has always stayed with me as a favourite so I have looked to buy on dvd but would recommend holding out for widescreen version as full screen versions are probably done from the same master as the video films was done and are cut with some of the violent scenes taken out and prefer to have fully uncut films and judge for myself if too violent for me to watch rather than have someone else like a Mary Whitehouse clone decide what is best for me as by all rights it is my money buying the film and I am big enough and ugly enough to decide for myself.

782712,3,6304109717,"It's frustrating to watch a film that could have been really good had the producer/director turned one way instead of another. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Johnathan Shale (Tom Berenger) is a mercenary who works with a set crew who are being ""retired."" He's at a loss as to what to do with his life when his girlfriend, a teacher at a tough Miami school, is kneecapped by a thug. He poses as her substitute so he can find out what's happening at the school, and why the head of the local gang (Marc Anthony) would want his girl out of commission.  What he finds is a big surprise.

This starts out cool because he knows squat about teaching and begins to tread water, right from the get go, with his students. When he wakes up, and begins teaching in a way that connects with them, he becomes a local hero. Then when he sees the snakes in the pit, and recruits his buds to make things right, it degrades into a violent, shoot-em-up with a dose of revenge.

The performances are decent enough as is the directing. This fails at the script level. The story pretty much says you need someone tough in the classroom, but someone who is not a bully. He relates his experiences in Viet Nam to help teach history from that period. As that war was still fresh in people's minds, the kids understand. Many of them were personally affected by it. So you now have discipline and communication. This comes as a surprise, as well as a relief, to both him and his students. They all now feel involved. It seems to be working, but then the gun play in the climax comes into being it all goes down the toilet. There was a really cheap line of dialogue near the end to explain why, with untold amounts of bullets fired, and explosives detonated, it took the police so long to arrive. It was just really stupid.

For my dollar, they needed to stay the course in teaching and set up the evil doers to be apprehended without all the fire power. I think this would have sent the best message. My guess is, those involved in the production, figured bullets sell better than brains so they did what they did.",1365638400,,2103,4.368286445012788

782781,3,6304109717,"""FX"" director Robert Mandel's urban crime thriller ""The Substitute"" fuses elements of ""Blackboard Jungle"" with ""The Equalizer."" In ""Blackboard Jungle,"" a teacher (Glenn Ford) tangled with savage, inner-city youth. In the CBS-TV thriller series ""The Equalizer,"" an urban security expert allowed his clients to resume life without fear from assailants.

Tom Berenger stars as a covert operations specialist on holiday who finds himself back into the classroom to rumble with a drug czar and his killers. The action is as fast and as furious as one of the submachine guns fired in this larger-than-life, but exciting exercise in educational reform. Mandel and ""Street Trash"" scenarist Roy Frumkes, ""Substitute 2"" scribe Rocco Simonelli, and ""Cat People"" writer Alan Ormsby have created an entertaining, suspenseful, sometimes amusing, melodrama with a minor surprise or two. ""Ghost Busters"" star Ernie Hudson registers splendidly as a corrupt high school principal who abuses his authority by allowing sales of narcotics on his premises.

An earnest, forthright teacher Jane Hetzko (Diane Venora of ""True Crime"") confronts high-ranking gang-banger Juan Lacas (Marc Anthony of ""Hackers"") during a campus brawl, and he doesn't like the way that she talks to him so he threatens her. Later, as Jane is jogging by herself along the beach, a thuggish Seminole confronts her and cracks one of her knee caps with a bat. Jane's off-again, on-again boyfriend Jonathan Shale (Tom Berenger of the ""Sniper"" movies)tangles briefly with the brute before the brute escapes. Jane lands in the hospital and Shale takes care of her. Shale calls for Jane's usual substitute, but the man isn't available. Instead, Shale gets one of his mercenary buddies, Rem (Luis Guzmn of ""Anger Management""), to put him into the school's computer system as James Smith with three diplomas from prestigious Ivy League universities.

Shale has the time to devote to Jane's problem, because his men and he have completed a mission that attracted too much international attention and he has to cool it for a while. Meantime, he keeps his surviving commandos in line and out of harm's way. A job to guard drug shipments comes up, but once our virtuous hero learns that he would be killing to ensure the safe passage of narcotics, he turns the job down cold and reprimands his comrade, Joey 6 (Raymond Cruz of ""The Rock"") for setting up the interview.

Instead, Shale masquerades as a substitute school teacher when he cannot get an actual substitute for Jane. He assembles his team and tells them that where drugs are concerned, money can be found in large quantities. This serves as their inducement to mobilize their special skills. Along the way, another caring teacher, Mr. Darrell Sherman (Glenn Plummer of ""Saw 2"") gets in the way of the villains, particularly Claude Rolle (Ernie Hudson of ""Ghost Busters"") and pays the ultimate price. The heroes and the villains turn the high school into a battlefield. The villains have stashed a lifetime's worth of cocaine in the school's maintenance garage and Hollan (William Forsythe of ""Once Upon A Time in America"") rigs it up with explosives so when the bad guys go to retrieve it, they are blown up. Not all of the good guys survive this bullet-riddled shoot'em up. Raymond Cruz is quite good and William Forsythe plays another one of his hot-tempered maniacs.

The number of people in his ""crew"" and fire fights that followed were more realistic in: that many bullets flying around odds are people are going to get hit and some die. Lots of action movies have the heroes going through a hail of bullets and not getting a scratch.
The follow on Substitute movies [2 - 4] had Berenger replaced with Treat Williams who had a better background for the character to explain how he could be a teacher.

It's a hard movie not to like(unless you're a film snob) because it's one of those movies you wish would really happen.  C'mon, it's fun to watch a badass mercenary throw some gang bangers who think they're hot stuff out a second story library window.

Then it gets a little on the unrealistic side as he uncovers a more sinister plot brewing beneath the school.  SPOILER AHEAD:(But do you really care?  This is a cliche action flick and I'm sure you'll all see this ""twist"" coming or have  seen it done before.)  A mercenary out for revenge on a gang is somewhat believable, but the principal running a big scale drug operation out of the school is pushing it a little.  That and the fact that dead kids(and teachers) are turning up by the metric ton and the cops don't ever seem to notice.  But hey, this is an action film, no need to be that critical.  I also get a laugh out of these classroom scenes.  You know what I'm talking about:  Total chaos.  Kids blasting boomboxes, throwing stuff around and telling the teacher to ""&@$# off"".  I've never been to Miami or L.A.  Do some schools really look like this?  Berenger does a decent job as the hard, take-no-B.S. mercenary.  Everyone's favorite latin singer Marc Anthony plays a gang leader, and the always likable Ernie Hudson is cool as the corrupt principal.  Hudson can do a good bad guy when he wants to.  William ""Flatop"" Forsythe is always fun to watch and here he's no exception.  The Substitute is fun.  Sure it wasn't received all that well from the critics upon it's release, but critics don't really tend to watch movies for the sake of simply enjoying them.

Check it out-No message, nothing deep or enlightening here just cheap, schlocky fun(like my ex-girlfriend).",1100995200,5,2257,4.703324808184143
782832,3,6304109717,"Tom Berenger is the head of a top-secret team of mercernaries, who decides to infiltrate a Miami high school after his girlfriend is beaten up, Nancy Kerrigan style, by one of the students. As it turns out, the school is being run by drug dealers and gang goons who answer to the principal, a former cop who runs a high-grade drug lab out of the basement in the gym. Any movie with Ernie Hudson as an evil high school principal, a wacked-out William Forsythe, and Latin singer Marc Anthony as the juvenile leader of a gang creatively titled the ""Kings Of Destruction"" can't be all bad, can it? Think of it as ""Dangerous Minds"" written for Steven Seagal.",1082851200,5,653,4.5423728813559325

782835,4,6304109717,"This is a quality entry in the high school hell genre of films.  Tom Berenger plays John Shale, a mercenary who takes a job substitute teaching his girlfriend's high school hell class after some thugs from the school knee-cap her.
Naturally, he's a Vietnam veteran who hasn't gotten over the war.  He and his gang of similarly disturbed vets plan to bust a major drug ring in the school and take off with the cash that the principal, played by Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson, is making selling coke to his students.  Of course, Shale gets very righteous and says it's not for the money in the end.
This film ultimately delivers some quality violence as the high school is reduced to a war zone for a good ten minutes with not a cop, fireman, or ambulance in sight.  Lots of people die, at some points I actually couldn't even tell who was shooting at who, but it just didn't matter.  The gang is cleaned out of the school like a cancer, exterminated by Shale and thus gratifying his need to resolve the Vietnam conflict in his mind.
Expect the requisite scene of him 'reaching' the troubled students one day by talking about war and being shot and then realizing that their urban ghetto is a warzone, too.  Expect quality character acting by William Forsythe as one of Shale's whacko vet buddies who's along for the ride, evoking images of his demented turn as Richie in Out for Justice.
This movie will get the job done on a slow night.  The Substitute series is now a staple of late night cable, with Treat Williams playing another (psychotic) mercenary cleaning up trouble spots in our nation's schools.  Recommended for genre fans...",1071360000,4,1631,4.638888888888889
782836,4,6304109717,"I watched this movie with my sweet, grandmotherly, grey-haired mother. We both loved it. Something about it struck a chord with both of us.
I guess maybe because both of us (yes, even sweet grey-haired mom) have experienced somewhat miserable school experiences--I don't know why, exactly, but something about this film was cathartic. I think we both wished we'd had a school teacher who was a little like the Tom Berenger character in this film.
Berenger plays a tough merecenary type who ends up infiltrating a very rough high school, after his teacher-girlfriend is injured by school thugs. We both enjoyed seeing this take-no-BS fellow handle his unruly classes. We *really* enjoyed seeing this.
The supporting cast (including Berenger's eclectic collection of mercenary buddies) are excellent. Ernie Hudson as the villan is very effective.
A very entertaining film!  Recommended.",1039910400,8,884,5.359712230215828
782837,4,6304109717,"I recall high school as a more subtle sort of hell than it's portrayed here. Then again, I went to school in a much smaller city.
Plot : Good guy merc temps for girlfriend teacher when school gangs break her kneecap.
It's a good film, with some above average acting and an inevetable ending. To our Hollywood trained eyes, the fights may seem slow; the film wasn't sped up, as is usualy the case for filming fight scenes. I personaly like this; not everyone will. It has some funny scenes, mostly intentional; but these days the big car phone with the cord qualifies as funny too.
The following isn't really a criticism, but more of an observation about it as a standard action flick; there arn't any real spoilers, but if you've never seen it you may want to skip this part and rent it, so you can watch with unbiased eyes:
The bad guys are typical bad guys, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever to make them people. The mercs are fairly mercenary, only the leader thinks taking on a job guarding drug deals is a bad idea. The teachers are uniformly dedicated (except they only show 2 teachers and a librarian) and even with all the gunfire at school the police never do show up on screen. Everything is clear-cut, straightforward and easy to understand. Actually, that's not really a gripe; it is uncomplicated as a movie, but it's very well done.",1035849600,10,1351,4.563786008230453

7861855,3,6304109717,"For a 1990s movie, this was pretty good for its time.  An ex-military/special ops leader decides to infiltrate as a substitute teacher after his good female friend was beaten up by a local gang that resides in the school where she teaches in Miami.  The high school is in an at-risk neighborhood filled with violence and teenage pregnancy.  The school is operated by a black principal who was an ex-cop in the gang unit.  It turns out that the principal is in on the action with the local gang and is using the school as a front.  The ex-military guy and his team decides to take part in the action and make some money off of the gang by stealing their funds and merchandise to then buy supplies for the school.  This becomes a gang war in a sense between the KOD gang and the ex-military team.

The acting was good, but the fight scenes seem a bit slow and poorly choreographed.  The shoot em up scenes were okay.  Overall, it had a decent plot even though the movie was a bit long.  Mark Anthony is in this movie, but he didn't seem like a tough guy even though his role was supposed to be a tough gang leader.",1503014400,2,1112,4.277511961722488
