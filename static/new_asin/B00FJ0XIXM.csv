8615989,5,B00FJ0XIXM,"Throw captions to the wind, grab a cup of tea, a note book, and get ready to watch this feel good, entertaining, true life movie from France, which includes lots of food.  I love this movie! Have watched it several times and will watch it several times more.  Watched it to be entertained, and was not disappointed.  From time to time I am relaxed enough to deal with a foreign language film subtitles.  So glad I did not pass on this film.  Great acting, director. beautiful scenery, funny, a bit of heart tugging, and history.",1470614400,2,528,4.515789473684211
8615990,3,B00FJ0XIXM,"Madame Lavorie gets hired to be the French President's personal cook, much to the distress of the Elyse's all-male Main Kitchen. It's a great premise but somehow the movie never achieves the dramatic showdown one eagerly anticipates. After a presidential budget cut, Mme Hortense resigns, thanks her employer and heads for the South Pole. That's it; end of movie!

 I'm not giving the plot away, because aside from witnessing some astonishing dishes, there's not much of a plot to speak of.

That's another thing: The President (in real life, Franois Mitterrand, though no one mentions him by name in the picture and the actor portraying him doesn't look like him at all) tells Mme. Lavorie he wants simple French food; the kind Maman used to make back then. Nothing fancy or elaborate, you know? -just mere comfort food. One wonders if the President was born and raised in Le Grand Vfour, because right away she presents him with the sort of dishes we humble mortals take pictures of in a trip to Paris, so friends at home can believe them!",1442016000,,1041,4.772222222222222
8615991,5,B00FJ0XIXM,"What a beautiful story.  On the surface of course, we are entertained by the story of a female chef who works in the private kitchen of her President and must contend with the cruel, arrogant bullying of her male peers in the other kitchens.  She didn't allow them to intimidate her and her passion for traditional French cooking persevered.  On the other hand, it was a terribly grueling job that finally took a toll on her health and she resigned after two years to pursue another opportunity closer to fulfilling her ultimate dream.

As a cook, I was moved by her passion for traditional cooking.  I absolutely loathe the Food Network and all its pretentious and unnecessary ingredients- obviously sponsored to make people spend more money and get fat and sick on empty calories and no taste.  Simple and elegant is the way that I learned to cook and why I rarely ever buy a modern day cookbook. I use cookbooks that my great great grandmother used and I have all their hand-written recipes with notes about holidays, how things tasted and more.  I'll treasure them till I die.  Today it seems no one knows what a chocolate pie tastes like unless it's loaded with caramel, cinnamon, chili pepper or other ridiculous ingredients. That's just not my style.  Like Hortense, I only use a few of the very finest ingredients.

 Aside from the mouth watering culinary inspiration, I took so much more away from this movie experience.  I noticed a strong woman with immense self respect, healthy boundaries, integrity and a passionate drive to pursue happiness and fulfillment in all her experiences.  She did not allow herself to fall victim to any circumstance and knew when it was time to move on without carrying a single thought of regret in any of her experiences.  That is how we should all live life ( in my opinion).",1439769600,10,1820,4.718354430379747

8615993,5,B00FJ0XIXM,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!! This is the Australian version that was the original in France. It has deleted scenes from the US version in the film which adds to the overall plot! And the great thing is, if you have a Blu-Ray player that the firmware has been updated in the past year, this movie will play!",1414195200,2,314,4.338983050847458
