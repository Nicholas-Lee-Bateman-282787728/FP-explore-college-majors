8593013,5,B00DGOBQ5K,"This video of Claudio Abbado and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra,with his handpicked musicians,from 2012 meets up to the high standards needed for this piece, one of the
greatest vocal works in the repetoire. No surprise. The Maestro, though relatively unheralded when compared to von Karajan or Bernstein has consistently led performances that hold their own with those of the more famous masters of the 20th century and since. Equally compelling are all of the voices and,too, the video presentation here. Never weak,always clear in form and with deep emotion,this disc is like a shining light that will burn forever. Not true, alas, for the Maestro,who left this world on 1/20/14. It is our great loss,as this becomes,as it had for Mozart himself,his own requiem. But it is only his mortal coil that has left us. The light of his spirit will indeed live on, leading those who listen, to the glories of some of the most beautiful and profound music ever written, and ever heard. RIP to Maestro Abbado,one of those rare ones in whose hands a baton was like a magic wand that elicited beauty that touched the soul. He will always be remembered as one of the greats,always be missed. This disc is a an example of why,like a monument to Mozart, and to him.",1391817600,7,1253,4.778801843317972
8593014,3,B00DGOBQ5K,"Just received a blue-ray of Mozart's Requiem as performed by Abbado @ Lucerne Festival. First time hearing today. Perhaps I expected too much? It is quite disappointing. First of all, why Beyer's version? I know many conductors love Beyer's version, because it sounded like Mozart. However, do they realize that Requiem does not at all sound like typical Mozart? It is more reminescent of Handel, and even quote some passages from him (Introitus and Kyrie). Too much trumpets by Sussmayr, and it must be silenced? How do you know? After all, Sussmayr is the one who assisted Mozart during the composition of Requiem. How can you change the terrific trumpet calls in Dies irae with stupid dotted rhythms, or even silience them in Confutatis (where the accused are thrown to everlasting fire)? To make matters worse, he uses Levin's version for Sanctus and Benedictus (just as he has done so in his CD recording made some time ago), but it sounds too close to his C-minor mass, not a good fit with Requiem. I still think Sussmayr's version of Sanctus and Benedictus are better, as long as his grammatical errors can be fixed (just as Gardiner did) or through some idiosyncratic reading (just like Bernstein). Secondly, the recording. Too much reverberation. I think Mahler's blue-rays (also by Abbado @ Lucerne) are not this bad. Perhaps because of different company?",1380672000,16,1365,4.965065502183406
8593015,3,B00DGOBQ5K,"There are a lot of polemics and speculation about Mozart's Requiem, which I consider nothing more than so much pedantic verbiage. I am not an expert on Mozart's Requiem, nor do I wish to be. The only important thing to me is whether or not I like a piece of music and am moved by it  and not whether it was'' perfectly'' finished in Mozart's style or whether it was rendered too slow or too fast by the conductor. Nor am I interested in some critic's academic opinion about whether a conductor's or musician's interpretation of any musical work is true to the composer's ''intentions'' especially in light of the fact that often such analysis is mere speculation.  As far as I am concerned, intellectual cerebral analysis has nothing to do with the ''soul'' of a performance.
About this this Blu-ray version of the Requiem,  I can say that, with respect to the music and the Abbado's rendering, I like this recording and am moved by it.
But liking a piece of music and appreciating the rendering of it are not my only criteria. I consider the sound quality of the recording just as important. I find it very hard to listen to a poor recording no matter how much I may like the music.
The quality of this recording could have been truly great (which would have earned it 5 stars from me), if only someone had paid attention to the sopranos. The sopranos, sometimes, are overpowering, very nearly drowning out the voices of the rest of the choir. I do not know if this was the case in the actual performance and Abbado just was not paying close enough attention to what the sopranos were doing (perhaps this imbalance was not even present in the actual performance) or if, on the other hand it was the fault of the sound engineers who either do not understand their role well enough to realize that they should be seeking equilibrium and balance in the final product, or, perhaps, do not understand music well enough to realize that, in a choir, balance is essential and no voice or voices should overpower any of the others. What I do know is that in either case ... Abbado's fault or the engineers' fault (and I sincerely hope it was not Abbado's fault) ... this vocal balance is an important detail that was overlooked.
I have 3 other versions of this Requiem, all of them SACDs. While all different, I like the music and the rendering in all of them (I do not see ''different'' as being ''better'' or ''worse'' and I guess I am easy to please). But I have not been satisfied with the sound quality of those recordings, hence I bought this Blu-ray version. This Blu-ray could easily have been the best because for the most part (when those sopranos are not singing or when they are holding back and singing more in balance with the rest of the choir) with respect to all other parameters the sound quality it is very good. And consequently I like it better than any of the SACDs I have.
But I do have one other objection:
When the choir is singing at full volume, I can hardly hear the orchestra at all.  The musicians are playing like mad, but, for the most part, I can only hear the bass truly well enough and I have to strain to hear the other instruments, especially the violins. The engineers should have paid attention to that detail as well.
Since the whole point of Blu-ray over CD or SACD is that it is the recording medium of the highest quality we have today (with the exception, perhaps, of a good vinyl recording) and presumably since this is why one would spend considerably more for a Blu-ray than for any of the other versions, the lack of attention to these details in not pardonable, so I confer only 3 stars to this recording of Mozart's Requiem.",1380067200,11,3666,4.483532934131737
