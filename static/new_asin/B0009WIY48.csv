2329803,4,B0009WIY48,"This work out is just what the title says, Classic Step Moves.  The moves maybe simple, but the pace and repetition give you a great work out!",1171584000,6,142,4.2592592592592595
2329804,5,B0009WIY48,"She does it again with this video. Basic moves, lots of repetition and her funny commentary to go along with it. It's over an hour long but you feel great afterwards. Some of transitions from each move gave me a little trouble (I am a seasoned stepper) but once you get the hang of it, it's great. And, though its over an hour, not boring and dragging on. She keeps you moving and that heart rate up. I own several of Gin's videos/dvds and rotate them throughout the week. I recently had a baby and not only did I lose my baby weight but I am in better shape than before. She is consistently good and gives good instruction. In this video she is alone in a studio, I liked it way better than her being in a warehouse with all the TV monitors, the band, etc. Lets you concentrate on the step and keeps you motivated. Would highly recommend!!",1168560000,17,840,4.25625
2329805,4,B0009WIY48,"I regularly attend step aerobics class and recently purchased a bench for home.  This is my first step DVD and I was very happy with it.  Gin uses basic steps but at a good pace so you definitely get a workout.  My only objection (and the reason I didn't give it five stars) was the music.  Adding some upbeat contemporary music would be great as opposed to the non-lyrics music that accompanied the moves.  From now on, I will use my ipod with headphones, mute the DVD, and just follow Gin!",1168473600,5,491,4.351648351648351
2329806,2,B0009WIY48,"I thought that since it was named ""Simply Step: Classic Moves"" that it would be aimed at beginners as well as old timers. I am just beginning to work with a step and this DVD was way over my head and my heart. I am now looking for someone to give it to.",1168473600,8,253,3.792452830188679
2329807,5,B0009WIY48,"As a fan of stepping, this is just a perfect, up tempo addition to anyone's collection.  Gin Miller once again proves herself to be the expert I have continued to work out to.  I attribute my recent 45 lb. weight loss to this program and to her other Reebok work-outs.  Thanks, Gin, and don't stop putting out great work out videos.",1167868800,2,332,4.409836065573771
2329808,5,B0009WIY48,I am a new step aerobics instructor and I have been studying different aerobics DVDs to prepare for my classes. This was my first DVD by Gin Miller and it will definitely not be my last. Her teaching style is very refined and the workout  is well designed. She maintains a high level of intensity while delivering an interesting choreography based on classic moves. This DVD is excellent for beginners or anyone wishing to revisit the fundamentals of step. It is also a great idea for new instructors who would like to observe refined techniques for teaching step aerobics.,1163808000,12,573,4.787878787878788
2329809,5,B0009WIY48,"Ok, this DVD is worth the money.  It kicked my butt today!  It is 51 minutes of cardio with separate warm up and cool down time.  I was about 8 minutes into the beginning (already sweating) and Gin Miller says ok, now that we're warmed up, let's get started.  Then I knew I was in for a  great, challenging workout.  Don't be fooled by the title...it's a definite work-out.  Loved it!",1163030400,46,384,4.323943661971831
2329810,5,B0009WIY48,"Don't let the ""simple"" fool you: Gin's choreography may be straightforward, but this work out is anything but ""easy.""  By the end, you will be fully energized, and drenched -- just in time for Gin to joke about whether your ""hair and makeup"" still look good - LOL!  This DVD is an excellent refresher if you're re-joining the step world, or if you want a break from all of the dance-y intricate choreography other instructors provide.  That is NOT to say that this workout is boring -- far from it!  It includes all of the classic step moves, and some great floor work (get ready for jumping jacks and other good old fashioned cardio).  Also: Gin provides plenty of explanation and opportunity to ""get"" the steps; repetition of one move in this routine provided and ""A-HA!"" moment -- I was able to master a step that showed up as and ""Add-On"" in another routine.  This will be a fine workout to add to your step rotation.  Master this classic work out, and then see if those dance-y workouts don't come a bit more quickly!  Highly recommended!",1158192000,75,1043,4.56989247311828
2329811,5,B0009WIY48,"From the inventor of step aerobics.  You know that Gin knows what she's doing and how to do it.  She invented Step Reebok so she does know a thing or two.  I love this workout.  It's all the step classics here.  She doesn't use fancy dance steps, but the intense moves you do in this are designed to maximize results.  She makes this fun with tempo variations and directional changes.  It's really well designed and her cueing is clear and precise as always.  There are straddles and repeaters etc etc.  All the good moves to make you sweat and fit.  Enjoy.  You'll feel this for a day or two afterward.",1134691200,120,603,4.390909090909091
2329832,4,B0009WIY48,This is a solid and no frills workout video.  It isn't condescending or too cute.  Much appreciated.,1453680000,2,100,4.823529411764706
2329833,2,B0009WIY48,Maybe it's me but its still to fast for me,1452384000,,42,3.3
2329834,3,B0009WIY48,"Totally enjoyed this workout.. Very easy to follow, basic moves but got a very good workout, was most definitely drenched in sweat by the end.  My only complaint is that the DVD worked fine until I got to the cool down and the tape started skipping.  I could barely get through the cool down because there was apparently scratches on this DVD, so for this reason, I will rate it 3 stars.",1446595200,,387,4.361111111111111
2329835,5,B0009WIY48,Excellent,1446163200,,9,9.0
2329836,5,B0009WIY48,I have other step videos and can never finish them because the steps are too difficult. This video is easy to do but very challenging and difficult to finish! Its an awesome video and really works!! Don't let the simplicity of the choreography fool you into thinking it won't work out that body. I woke up the next day so sore! I plan on buying more of her videos.,1444780800,,364,4.2898550724637685
2329837,5,B0009WIY48,"love the way she teaches, her work outs and easy to learn and follow",1444089600,,68,3.9285714285714284
2329838,5,B0009WIY48,"Gin Miller is absolutely flawless as far as I can tell -- by far, my favorite for step workout videos. I've been doing step for about 10 years. Some of these moves were new to me, but Gin breaks them down so well that they're not at all hard to pick up. She is the lone instructor on this video, but she still very capably shows the various difficulty levels for each move, from beginner to advanced, so you can tailor to your own ability level. She regularly demonstrates modifications. Cuing is impeccable. At nearly an hour, this is a great workout and a gold standard as far as I'm concerned.",1439078400,2,596,4.378378378378378
2329839,4,B0009WIY48,"I couldn't complete the workout, I lasted 30 minutes. My goal is to complete the 60 minutes workout. I highly recommend this dvd.",1424217600,,129,4.6521739130434785
2329840,5,B0009WIY48,"I just bought this for instant video and really enjoyed it.  I have taken classes led by amazing instrutors so I have been spoiled!  Gin Miller leads really well for someone who is a beginner yet the workout is challenging enough for a ""veteran stepper.""  She makes it easy to set the level just right for wherever you are at.  It's also not one of those cheesey 80's videos of which I own a few andstill enjoy but nice to have something a tad more modern!  I highly recommend this.",1423958400,,482,4.311111111111111
2329841,2,B0009WIY48,For claiming this was strictly step there sure is alot of Dancy stuff which I don't like. The main reason I purchased this DVD is because it claimed it was not dance moves. I don't mamba or cha cha and so I was really disappointed.,1420416000,,231,4.155555555555556
2329862,4,B0009WIY48,good purchase. helpful.,1417910400,,23,7.0
2329863,5,B0009WIY48,"This is a great workout:  super easy to learn and huge calorie burn (400 for me).  I am an experienced stepper but not a fan of the dancy, complex type of routine.  Gin Miller delivers a straightforward, athletic workout built from basic step moves; there are lots of options so that all fitness/step experience levels can use this routine.  So glad I got it; wish I had done so sooner.  Thanks, Gin, for another super workout!",1416096000,,427,4.565789473684211
2329864,3,B0009WIY48,too fast for old folks like me.,1416009600,,31,3.5714285714285716
2329865,4,B0009WIY48,"As advertised, this is good, basic step aerobics.  The music could be improved to be a bit more motivating or energetic but the step routine is good basic exercise for those who love stepping.  Gin's routines are easy to follow but give you plenty of options for low or high impact.",1415491200,,282,4.509803921568627
2329866,4,B0009WIY48,Got this one for my wife to use first and she really enjoys it.  The initial instructions are very clear and easy to follow and the workout progresses smoothly from there.,1415318400,,171,4.516129032258065
2329867,3,B0009WIY48,Very easy and repetitive.,1415318400,,25,5.5
2329868,5,B0009WIY48,"I'm glad I bought this because it takes you back to basics. The first time I tried this workout I was soaked in 20 minutes. After a week, it became easier in the first 20 minutes but still able to work up a sweat during the routine. I really like this step routine.",1414454400,2,265,4.018867924528302
2329869,5,B0009WIY48,Very good beginning workout for step.  Easy to understand and keeps you moving.  I highly recommend this.,1413936000,,105,5.117647058823529
2329870,4,B0009WIY48,"Have problems advancing the tape, but finally it worked all the way through and I really enjoyed it.  I thought something was wrong with my vcr/dvd machine, but that is working ok.",1412726400,,180,4.625
2329871,2,B0009WIY48,"Not too happy with Gin in this DVD, although her cueing is perfect, I didn't like the mambo and chacha on the floor, also the traveling over the platform is not good because you can miss your step really easily and fall. But in overall she is an excellent instructor. I just don't like this dvd",1408924800,,294,4.267857142857143
2329910,5,B0009WIY48,I used to be a AFAA certified aerobics instructor and had been to Gin Millers workshops before. Love this classic step dvd.,1402099200,2,123,4.636363636363637
2329911,5,B0009WIY48,"I have to say I love to hate Gin Miller.  This was my first time out in the ball park and she tore me up.  I was sweating up a storm after only 10 minutes.  I did this step program 2 times within 4 days while watching my diet and a I loss 4 pounds.  Yes, a pound a day.

I have to say it is an effective video but I hate to put it in the DVD player because I know I am going to get my butt kicked.  That is how good this video is.

Hats off to Gin.",1400803200,2,448,3.376237623762376
2329912,4,B0009WIY48,"I like the workout, but there is a segment that is a bit jazzy that is not typical Gin Miller!",1400284800,,94,3.75
2329913,5,B0009WIY48,Love Gin Miller.  Her personality and sense of humor shine through.  She's a great instructor and encourages the viewers to work hard.  Gin gives great cues and clearly demonstrates when changing moves.  I've been doing this routine a few times a week for three weeks and still haven't made it completely to the end.  Although I am seeing a big change in my endurance levels.  You will work up a sweat and Gin provides options during this workout for those who are more fit.  It would be great if the DVD offered some premixes for people who are new to step and for those times that I don't have an hour to exercise.  I'd also love if Gin added a segment for toning and muscle building.  You'll work hard and feel the benefits when your finished and Gin makes it fun.  I've ordered several more of Gin's step DVD's and can't wait to try them out.,1399420800,,846,4.365384615384615
2329914,5,B0009WIY48,"Great moves and easy to follow direction from the master herself. A little humor thrown in as always. Great workout, you won't be disappointed.",1397520000,,143,5.0
2329915,1,B0009WIY48,"The jabber is annoying the first time through. The picture quality is poor (but then, there's not much to look at). The workout is too long, too repetitive, not nearly as good, or customizable, as the workout on the VHS tape I got when I bought my step 15 or more years ago and was hoping this one would replace (that one had 5 people exercising at different levels and was divided into 3 segments). Wish there had been a better preview. Unfortunately, I trusted other reviews and the fact that I've liked other Gin Miller videos and bought the instant video. So I can't even give it away!",1396137600,3,589,4.412844036697248
2329916,5,B0009WIY48,Great step workout!  Gets the heart rate up and fun.  I like that the steps are easy to master but still gets the heart rate up.  I think it helps that I like Gin Miller's manner and attitude.,1395964800,,192,4.0
2329917,4,B0009WIY48,This Step workout is GREAT!!  It does the job and she can be followed.  Even if you can't do the exact step she's got you set up to keep moving - keep the heart rate up!  Love this no nonsense lady!!  Ordered another ladies - don't like it at all.  Too many people in the background just causes confusion.  I like how Gin does it alone.,1395619200,,336,4.015151515151516
2329918,5,B0009WIY48,"I am a seasoned exerciser.  I like this routine because it is fast paced and very easy to learn.  Some complain that the moves are too repetetive.  I like that because I can focus on getting a good work out and not the fancy moves that are coming up. I have very little space to work out so her moves work for me.  Gin is a good teacher.  She gives good cues and lets you know what is coming up.  I usually don't complete the whole workout, but usually at least 40 to 50 minutes of it..  You will definitely sweat.  Great Workout, Highly recommend.",1393632000,,548,4.152380952380953
2329919,2,B0009WIY48,"Did this once.  It wasn't for me. This is most likely for someone beginning step, who is a Gin fan.  Not for intermediate or advanced.",1391040000,,134,4.32
2329939,5,B0009WIY48,"This was just what I was looking for to add to my work-out regime. It was like taking a personal class in the earlier days of Step Aerobics before the trend for fancy footwork. This video features straighforward Aerobics from a very likeable instructor.

I definitely get a good work-out. Not just fluff, but a combination of excercises that an older person (60) like myself can use at my own pace. I did Aerobics in my 40's, and this is how I learned to do them.

Very glad I made this purchase for its reasonable price and good quality.",1388966400,3,538,4.424242424242424
2329940,5,B0009WIY48,"At first I thought Gin Miller was going to be a bit corny and annoying. But after doing her workout a few times, I came to appreciate how tough the workout is, yet how manageable, with her simple and easy to follow patterns and well timed cues. You don't have to be super-fit to cope. But if you are, you'll still get a lot from the workout The point If you want very complex, confusing and extremely difficult-to-master patterns, this might not be for you.",1384214400,2,457,4.3882352941176475
2329941,1,B0009WIY48,"I totally disliked this tape, it is slow and boring and unattractive.  Does not motivate you to follow her or stay through the whole length of the exercises.",1381017600,3,157,4.607142857142857
2329942,4,B0009WIY48,"I enjoy this dvd to use with my step; however, the quality of the video is pretty bad; I probably wouldnt have ordered this if i knew before hand; the workout it pretty good though.",1380672000,,181,4.2
2329943,5,B0009WIY48,"This is an upbeat, flawlessly cued work-out.  Throughout the routines, Gin Miller shows options for beginners, or propulsion moves for those who seek higher intensity training. The pace is smooth and quick, with basic step patterns that can easily be followed.

The background music is rather typical, electronic beat type of workout music.  It is low enough in volume that it doesn't compete with Gin's voice, which is enthusiastic, yet she doesn't come across as an overly perky cheerleader, or boot camp instructor.

This is a great cardio work out for those seeking the benefits of step aerobics, without complex choreography.",1379721600,2,630,5.207920792079208
2329944,5,B0009WIY48,I love the old classic Step Aerobics and still use it sometimes but this is a great workout and i am glad I bought it to start over again.,1373328000,,138,3.793103448275862
2329945,5,B0009WIY48,"Easy to follow-just challenging enough to keep me interested but not have me trip over my feet, this workout is a really great cardio routine you can do in your home! So glad I never threw out my step :)",1369180800,,203,4.1
2329946,5,B0009WIY48,This is the woman who made it happen Cap'n.  The video is slow enough to get you moving and allow you to keep up.  There is the tutorial section so that you can see how to do the moves.  You will feel the burn at the end.,1368835200,,221,3.6595744680851063
2329947,5,B0009WIY48,"I find Gin Miller to be a ""no-frills"" instructor, catering to realistic home exercise programs.  She excludes all the fancy, complicated steps that most of these videos incorporate in their home workouts.  This tape provides a good workout, with realistic goals and leaves the fancy footwork for dancing enthusiasts.",1366675200,,316,5.428571428571429
2329948,5,B0009WIY48,This workout is an older version which came out on cd and it is a great workout.  Good music and a fun way to really tone your legs and buttocks,1364515200,,144,3.8
2330009,5,B0009WIY48,Could not ask for a better beginner's step DVD. Gin Miller is very basic in this and repeats things often enough that even I get it.,1364515200,,132,4.115384615384615
2330010,5,B0009WIY48,"I started with Everybody Steps and while it does't take long before it's not all that challenging, I always have the option of raising the step or maybe it's just a day when I want to move, but not too hard. This video is more challenging and I'm still working at following all the moves which is fine. I switch between this one and Everybody Steps, but I also use my treadmill and elliptical. I try to do some Pilates and some weights, as well. I just love to have lots of variety and this meets my needs.

What I particularly enjoy is that I was able to access this video immediately through Amazon My TV. I have Apple TV and Roku and both easily access Amazon. Please give us more. I know step exercises aren't as popular right now, but I think they're still fun and challenging.",1363305600,,782,4.283783783783784
2330011,5,B0009WIY48,"I LOVE THIS VIDEO! Gin Miller does a fantastic job of mixing basic step aerobic moves with fun combinations & upbeat music. I'd say this workout is great for a beginning stepper. I used to do step regularly about 5 years ago and decided to get back into it because it's such a fun & great workout. This is video definitely met my expectations & I love step just as much as I did then :) I highly recommend trying it out. Gin is has a silly & encouraging personality that keeps you going rather than being an annoyance. It gets me sweating & I workout pretty regularly. She adds a lot of options to make it just a little harder & continually checks your heart rate to make sure you're working hard enough or help you come down a notch if you're working too hard. If you're just trying to get off the couch onto your feet, this is a great beginner step video. If you've been doing step for awhile, this may be a little too beginner. The steps are very easy to pick-up also. All around, great video :)",1362787200,5,998,4.203125
2330012,5,B0009WIY48,"This is my first Step CD.  I loved the step class I took at our local fitness center, and wanted a good step workout for my home, when I could not make the class.  Gin's Simply Step was perfect.  Great workout without taking up my entire living room.  She is very motivational and an easy to understand instructor with clear instructions and music accompaniment that does not drown out her instructions.  I will look to purchase another one of her Step CD's. This was a great value and worth every penny.
Thanks, Chris",1361923200,,518,4.526881720430108
2330013,4,B0009WIY48,"This is a great video for a beginner or even a practiced step aerobics person.  Great energy and Gin's instructions are very clear.  The steps closer to the end are a little more complicated and in my opinion, not necessary, but you can modify your workout around that.  Would recommend this to anyone interested in getting a good cardio workout.",1360108800,,346,4.733333333333333
2330014,4,B0009WIY48,"Just finished my first workout. She is very easy to follow but the workout is not easy, meaning it'll make you sweat. And Gin Miller does it so well, I found myself talking to her as we worked out. lol. She does a great job of showing an easy, medium and harder way to do some of the steps. I would highly recommend this video if you really like traditional step aerobics, like I used to get at the gym. I wish there were more than one routine on the DVD (although it is a 60-minute workout). But guess that just means I'll have to buy another Gin Miller DVD, which I plan to do after mastering this one.",1358985600,,604,4.084033613445378
2330015,4,B0009WIY48,"I started using Gin Miller's step workouts in the 1990's because I needed a low impact workout I could do at home that wouldn't hurt my ultra-sensitive knees.  I'm back again because I need to lose weight after entering a rather long plateau phase.

I like Gin's excellent cueing, which is still just as stellar as it was in the nineties. She was 49 when she made this workout, so I'm within a few years of what her age was at the time and I could be fairly confident about being able to finish the entire thing without falling over. While the moves themselves are fairly basic and depend on higher reps and user-chosen intensity to elevate heart rate, this DVD gets the job done. You will lose weight (if that's what you want), gain endurance and muscle tone while helping your heart and blood pressure--all without hurting your joints.  That's what I ask for in a workout. I alternate this workout with belly dance and yoga to keep my body in a semi-surprised state.

I noticed one problem with camera movement for a second or two and a single incorrect cue (at about 46:25), but other than that the production value is high and Gin doesn't miss a beat. The music isn't my favorite of all time, but as an accompaniment to the exercise, it works. Besides, her personality and humor make the workout much easier to tolerate than most--even though the stepping isn't fancy. I don't really need fancy, to be honest.  I need to be able to follow the moves without tripping over my feet with all sorts of dance steps.  Gin Miller has always been able to make me feel less than clumsy, and that's an accomplishment.",1358899200,5,1610,4.515463917525773
2330016,5,B0009WIY48,"I wanted to add some variety to my home aerobics program so I asked and received a step for Christmas.  There were few video offerings for step aerobics that weren't out of a time capsule.  I downloaded Gin Miller's dvd and was very pleased.  It is a basic rundown on classic step aerobics.  She is a wonderful teacher, very forgiving!  The DVD builds on each new move, culminating in a great work-out.

With two risers on my step, I was able to keep my heart rate up and felt like I got a good workout.  There were only one or two steps that I didn't get right the first time I tried (which is rare for me.)  Gin's positive and fun attitude made the workout a pleasure.  I will say that it is only as intense as you make it - for example, you will get a better workout if you do all the hops and arm movements she offers rather than the easier modifications.

I may have done something wrong, but for now I'm modifying the moves to something that doesn't cause any trouble for me. I'm 56 and overweight right now so I would expect a little difficulty.

My only complaint is the music.  I'd much rather some good 80's or 90's type music.  I get bored with what she uses.  Unfortunately no one seems to indicate what type of music they use so you can only try and see.

2330089,4,B0009WIY48,"I remember taking step classes in the 90's and really taking for granted how good the workout was. While I waited for this DVD to arrive I did some research and found that they burn between 400-680 calories per (which is comparable to a run). I recently have not been able to run due to my flat feet (major shin splints and lower back pain) but I needed to get some pure unadulterated cardio in so this was my big hope and it delivers. I will say that I feel more comfortable with this workout because by all accounts Gin Miller created the step programs we are familiar with today via Step Reebok. The workout is intense but if you monitor you exertion level with the scale on the screen you can make it through the entire thing (you will be dripping with sweat however :). The warm up is insufficent though for such a vigorous workout so sadly you will have to make other arrangements then start her video to prevent injury. Caution: if you are like me an do a lot of workouts at home this is old school all the way and is NOT 30 MINUTES. Its more like an aerobics class at the gym for 60 minutes. This can be good if you really want to get maximum results but be aware you will be working longer and harder than other cardio DVD's on the market. Happy stepping!

Oh and by the way, the moves are all classic step so if you have ever taken one before you'll be amazed how much you remember. Newbies def start with 1 step or none at all and focus on endurance. Mu ha ha ha!",1297641600,24,1474,4.153846153846154

My very first step tape was Gin Miller's Reebok tape which is probably 20 years old by now.  It was so unique and a lot of fun so I thought I would give this tape a shot.  Yes, Gin makes a few corny comments but at the end of the long workout I was sweating and knew I had one great cardio workout.  The steps were easy enough to learn but not so boring I wouldn't want to keep doing the workout.

Despite what some reviewers say, this workout is not, I repeat, NOT for beginners!  The moves may be basic, but this is a 51 minute cardio workout.  According to Collage Video, this is rated as Intermediate / Advanced.  I'm probably a beginner/intermediate stepper and this kicked my butt!

The great thing about this video though, is you can adapt it to your fitness level.  Gin gives you plenty of options to make this as easy (i.e., you can do the same movements on the floor), or as challenging as you like.  Yes, this workout DOES go on and on, it's 50 minutes, but it says so right on Amazon so if it's too long for you, skip it and try something else.

Personally, I love this workout - this is the first Gin Miller workout I bought, and I ended up getting a few more by her, including the original Step Reebok video (I like Simply Step better, but that's just me).

Gin's cueing is perfect - not only is she an expert but she knows how to TEACH a class, which is important, as many instructors seem to not know how to teach, regardless of their expertise.

Also, her sense of humor makes the workout enjoyable, making the 50 minutes go by pretty fast (believe it or not!)

This video is great for someone who has been at least walking that involves some exertion (no leisurely stroll) as a daily routine and wants to pump up their workout routine.  Gin is the best caller and gives you plenty of warning before she does a change up.  She has you hold a move, explains and shows the next move, then gets you going.
This video is for beginners, not novices, but Gin has one.

I purchased Gin's other Step Aerobic video, ""Everybody Steps:  A guide to Step Aerobics."" Gin breaks down the exertion levels into three separate levels, novice, beginner, regular.  The video box includes a guide to build up to the next level.  The novice (first) level is about 8 minutes long.  The novice was too slow for me, but I'm sure it's great for someone who's never done step or is really out of shape.  You can do all or just some of the moves on the step as Gin explains.

With each new move, Gin shows a beginner step, then adds to it if you want to make it harder for intermediate and adds to it again for advanced.  However, you do not have to do the intermediate or advanced step moves and you can just keep doing the beginner step moves.  I say this because many reviews are not clear about how the video is structured.  You can do this as a beginner if you are able to keep the same move going without getting confused when Gin is also showing and doing intermediate and advanced moves.  I think that this is an excellent video to grow with because as you get comfortable with the moves you can add in the intermediate and hard arms to make the workout harder.  I am a definite beginner and I have not had any problem keeping up with this video, I am starting to do some intermediate moves, but overall I just keep doing the basic step moves.

I was hoping to practice a bit at home and was pleasantly surprised by this workout.  While some workouts have you so confused when you first try them that you're not even able to get much exercise, this one is relatively easy to follow the first time through and you get your heartrate up - even if you're not hitting every step perfectly.  It's also a good, solid length - approx one hour including the warm-up and cool-down.  The workout is designed so that you keep building on the steps you've learned as you go along, so you can always just do part of it the first time and pick up on the rest of it next time through if you prefer.  People who love the ""dancier"" stuff will probably find this way too boring, but if you just want a good step workout without all the ""jazzy"" stuff, then this workout is for you.",1204070400,,929,4.196629213483146
2330184,3,B0009WIY48,"This is nothing like the Reebok videos.  It's not very upbeat.  I was so disappointed.  The workout is too easy, I was expecting something much tougher.  Probably good for beginners.  Gin is the only person on the video.  It's a strange set up. It's nothing all all like the Reebok VHS tapes of old.  I much preferred those to be honest.",1200960000,5,337,4.426229508196721
2330185,5,B0009WIY48,"After using this DVD I found that I agree with most of the reviews.  What I'd like to add is that not only is Gin Miller's queing excellent but the camera work is superb as well.  There are only two angles, one from the front, the other a diagonal shot.  Most of the time the camera shoots from straight ahead but which ever angle is used, you always see Gin from head to foot so you always have a reference.  That may not seem like a big deal but it's very reassuring for those of us who need to see exactly where she's stepping.

One last item.  Someone put in their review that the music could have been livelier.  I couldn't disagree more.  I believe the music is modern and upbeat.  However, it doesn't dominate.  Instead the level of the music is appropriate so that Gin doesn't have to shout over it.

In my opinion, this DVD is textbook for how most videos should be shot.",1196121600,2,880,4.240963855421687
2330186,5,B0009WIY48,"I've done this workout about 5 times now. When I started doing it, I was a total novice to stepping and was discouraged by how challenging it is.

I'm glad I didn't give up. This DVD made me realize how out of shape I am; this morning, I was finally able to do it all the way  through. It is not easy but definitely gives you a great cardio workout.

I'm an avid home DVD workout person and have to say that Gin Miller is so unique from other instructors in that she has a great personality (no whooping and hollering here) and is very good at cuing you to the next move. Very important to someone uncoordinated, like me!",1192924800,6,621,4.158333333333333
2330187,5,B0009WIY48,This is the step workout I have been looking for ...  a great workout ... easy to learn routines...  definitely worth the money.  I own many many workout dvds.  This one is the only one I use for aerobic workouts.  It works for the beginner as well as the more advanced.,1191110400,3,270,4.215686274509804
2330188,5,B0009WIY48,"I'm such a cheapskate that I still can't believe I paid nearly $20 for this DVD, but I'm definitely not disappointed.  Although the moves are basic, you'll feel challenged. I was totally psyched when I finished the full 60 minutes on my first attempt.  I felt like such a champ! Even though I consider myself an intermediate stepper, this has never happened before.  I have always had a frustration quotient that has made me question my video workout purchase.  I think it's pure genius that Gin Miller developed a workout that's do-able AND challenging.  Buy this one!",1182297600,7,569,4.824742268041237

8068673,5,B0009WIY48,"Thank the Lord Gin did this Simply Step DVD.  I could cry thinking back to a couple really terrible years that left me so out of shape and weak.  I had gone from doing Intense Moves pretty easily to starting over with Simply Step and having to do most of it on the floor in front of the Step...even stopping for a minute now and then to catch my breath.  What a shocking, drastic decrease in my fitness level.  Classic Moves is the most simple and easy step DVD and you will see a huge difference in your ability by the 4th-6th time you do it if those are within 2-3 weeks imho.  Cried at Gin on the screen saying, 'I can't do it anymore.'  Her gentle, kind tone won out so eventually I felt supported, encouraged and pressed on.  I was able to do the whole Simply Step workout without stopping in about a month.  That was four years ago but it was and remains the BEST exercise vid for a new to stepper, overweight, older or weaker body and for those that love basic step choreo.  I wanted to share what a life saver it can be by allowing all these types of folks and more to do a step workout. I was really upset that I would have to spend who knows how long on the treadmill or something to work up to exercising on the step again.  Simply Step Classic Moves let me get right into it again!  Thank you.",1484179200,,1305,4.0984251968503935
8068674,5,B0009WIY48,"Fantastic workout! I was unable to do hard workouts due to injuries, and decided to try this. I could control how I performed the step routine to avoid aggravating my injuries and got great cardio by the time I was finished. I highly recommend this workout. I did this every day and lost a lot of weight! No diet, just Gin every single day and I have dropped about 6"" off my waist size! I have never progressed to 'air moves' but have added height to my step platform. After reaching my weight goal in 6 months, I still do this workout every few days to maintain my weight loss. Thanks Gin!",1471996800,,590,4.276785714285714

8068676,5,B0009WIY48,"This video is super easy to follow so if I'm half awake doing it in the morning I'll still be alright. The video is obviously old, as is her outfit and music. I actually find the ""gym teacher chic"" look quite refreshing from what people wear to work out these days. It's a nice supplement to other workouts. I wouldn't want to do the video more than once a week for fear of getting bored of it, but its great when you don't feel like thinking about your workout and fancy moves.

Gin is a great teacher, there are definitely some moments that I laugh out loud to even though I've done the video a bunch. This was the first step video I had ever done. I wanted something easy and relatively quiet to do in my apartment and this was perfect.",1466035200,,739,4.204225352112676
