8411332,4,B003ZYU5L2,"This is a great old british television series and can still be brought from amazon,co.uk. There are 2 boxsets of this series one is the Dutch  DE WREKERS, THE AVENGERS - The Complete Collection 1961-1969 the advert on amazon.co.uk claims it has 39 dvds but this seems to be a mistake as it clearly states it has 40 on the booxset in the picture shown.  At time of this review, DE WREKERS can be gotten for about 69 plus postage. Also there is a UK version of this boxset called, The Complete Avengers 50th Anniversary Edition with 39 dvds and is 5995 minutes long. At time of review it was 98 plus postage Though remeber these dvd boxsets will need a multi region dvd player or a blu-ray player that can play multi region  dvds, as they are both PAL region 2 dvd boxsets.",1412553600,4,771,4.340277777777778
