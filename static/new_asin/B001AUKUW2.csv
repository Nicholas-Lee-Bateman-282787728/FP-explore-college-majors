3467792,4,B001AUKUW2,"This is  first of the Saddle Club videos and is excellent for an 8-12 year old girl who loves horses and is interested in the interaction between the girls. As one who was not too involved in reading, the Saddle Club videos have resulted in an interest in the  Saddle Club books for the 9 year old and she is happily reading through the series and other books too. The Saddle club videos seem to be wholesome entertainment. Along with the horse riding and horse care, the girls in the videos deal with conflicts and problems and sort them out with kindness. There is usually a selfish girl and they learn how to deal with her. Yet the videos don't come across as instructional or sermonizing, but as very enjoyable.",1253145600,13,715,4.492307692307692

3467794,4,B001AUKUW2,"When I was about 12 I started reading these books. I had all of them and loved them. A few weeks before this Christmas I saw one of these videos at a local video rental store. I picked one up for my 7 year old daughter. To say she was hooked is just not strong enough. For Christmas I bought her this box set. I don't think anything else has been in her DVD player since. She loves the stories, the girls, and the horses. (Of course) I like the positive message many of the episodes send. A great buy for the winter time and kids trapped inside!",1232841600,12,545,4.055555555555555

3467805,5,B001AUKUW2,"My horse loving 7 year old loves this series! The story lines revolve around a group of Tweens who for the most part are appropriate for elementary age kids to watch. 1 episode had a ghost story that ""frightened"" my daughter briefly.

3467809,3,B001AUKUW2,"My six year old daughter went through a horse phase and we watched any video we could find with horses. I thought she might like this so we watched the first couple episodes.  While she seemed to enjoy them while watching the videos she never really mentioned it again afterwards and didn't really care to watch other episodes.  It may be because she got over the horse thing and has moved on.  It seems kids have so much available to them now it's really easy to get distracted by something new.  The show seemed fine, nothing controversial, normal tv kids show production quality.",1388448000,3,582,4.621359223300971

3467822,5,B001AUKUW2,"This wonderful series is perfect for any youngster crazy about horses.  You don't have to worry about violence or bad language--two adult characters sharing a few rather non-passionate kisses and a quick reference to a beheading when another character recites a local legend are the only ""iffy"" things shown.  The character of ""Veronica"" is an incredibly irritating little brat, but even she can't dampen the fun to be had watching the 26 episodes presented here.  Also included as a DVD bonus are a dozen ""Saddle Club Video Journals"" that showcase behind-the-scenes footage and tips on caring for horses.",1328832000,2,605,5.153061224489796

3467826,5,B001AUKUW2,"The Saddle Club DVD's that I purchased are very entertaining for my grand-daughters, who adore horses.  Their ages are 9 and 6.  I purchased ""Season I"" which includes about 10 episodes.  The girls have liked them all!  It is a gentle series of stories with no violence, vulgarity, and very little anger.
