7812715,4,6301395220,"Fortunately or unfortunately today, the availability of Blu Ray discs, puts unfair criticism on video productions not so available. And today we also have HD television which also adds to the critiques of older video productions not photographed in HD. This observation is not dissimilar to the time when all such video motion picture availability was in black and white before we were blessed with color. Sometimes though there are video records of performing arts productions that transcend recording technology regardless of the sophistication of the recording method that was used to preserve them. And surprisingly the strongest criticism that can be directed to this video record is that it is too short, just sixty minutes, on VHS or three sides of laser discs, the source of this reviewers critique. What we do have here is a preservation of several of the most outstanding Russian ballet dancers of a particular period, 1976-1986. The physicality of the Russians, both female and male, is obvious, possibly superior. And the experts can argue whether the Kirov or Bolshoi is the better ballet company. However both companies have the advantage of a large stage facility, larger than most Western venues, if not the largest worldwide. Realistically the video quality here is all that prevents a five star rating.",1426291200,,1320,5.172897196261682
7812716,3,6301395220,"The length of this DVD is about 25-30 minutes. I was a bit disappointed with what they presented--just several examples of how to make tessellations. The host and person who showed how to make tessellations sounded very wooden, so if you're showing this to students they will get bored quickly.

The only good thing about this were examples of the kind of artwork you can do with tessellations.

Personally, you're better off searching online for how to do different tessellations.",1295654400,,481,5.0
7812717,5,6301395220,"The performances on this video span the period from 1976 to 1986.  It opens with the world-reknowned Kirov corps de ballet performing the beautiful, hypnotic Entry of the Shades from ""La Bayadere.""  The  rest of the program consists of excerpts from other 19th century Russian  classic ballets -- ""Le Corsaire,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,""  ""Raymonda,"" ""Swan Lake,"" Paquita"" and ""Don  Quixote.""
Several famous pairs from different generations appear:  the dynamic, flashy duo of Tatyana Terekhova and Faroukh Ruzimatov;  the  elegant Galina Mezentseva and Konstantin Zaklinsky; and the sparkling Irina  Kolpakova and Yuri Solovyov (the latter was the Kirov's technical dazzler  just before Baryshnikov).
Other videos showcasing excerpts of Russian  ballet are ""The Glory of the Kirov,""  ""The Glory of the  Bolshoi"" and ""Russian Ballet:  The Glorious Tradition.""  Also look for full-length productions of ""Sleeping Beauty,""  ""Cinderella,"" ""La Bayadere,"" ""Swan Lake"" and  ""Don Quixote,"" danced variously by the Kirov or the Bolshoi.  England's Royal ballet has also taped productions of the above-mentioned  ballets, as well as showcases of excerpts.  They provide an interesting  contrast in style.",962236800,21,1188,5.745664739884393
