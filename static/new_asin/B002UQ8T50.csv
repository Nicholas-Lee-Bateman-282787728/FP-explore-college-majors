8381471,5,B002UQ8T50,"This film earned Pedro Infante an ""Ariel"" for Best Actor, which is Mexico's equivalent to the American ""Oscar."" A year later Pedro Infante would die tragically in an airplane crash, which is ironic since flying was one of Pedro Infante's passion. The film is in color, a change since most of the films of Pedro Infante and Maria Felix were filmed in Black & White prior to 1955. The quality of the film is great and it has probably been remastered for sound & quality. It contains a few songs by Pedro Infante and the rural scenes of the Mexican countryside are indeed breathtaking. A Great film!",1399507200,,596,4.579439252336448
