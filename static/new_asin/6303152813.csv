7839993,4,6303152813,"There's No Time for Love is probably most significant for the debut of Marcy in the history of Charlie Brown specials.  She's smart, sincere, and well-meaning.  Her only flaw is that she always calls her best friend Peppermint Patty ""sir"" (who has to remind Marcy endless times ""STOP CALLING ME SIR!"")!  Both of them have one thing in common- they have a crush on Chuck.  All 3 of them are supposed to go to the art museum on a school trip but they make a detour to the supermarket!
Charlie Brown falls in love with a girl he sees at a game on TV in Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown.  Determined to find her, he goes to the stadium where she was (with a little ""help"" from Linus and Snoopy) and spends the entire day searching for his TV romance (he makes a few wrong turns, though).",980640000,,789,4.304054054054054
7839994,5,6303152813,I adored this movie. It is very funny. I remember Marcie going to Pepperiment Patty's house at 4.00 a.m. And the second cartoon when that Little blond-hair girl fell in love with  Linus instead of Charlie Brown.,950227200,3,211,4.702702702702703
