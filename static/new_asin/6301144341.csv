8321420,5,6301144341,"I grew up in Seattle and was 12 years old when the mountain blew. I have relatives down in Longview, WA and was visiting them later that summer during another of the subsequent eruptions, which I viewed from an east-facing field on their property that gave us all a Cinerama-like view of that geologic fury.

So, naturally, viewing this video some three decades later has a peculiar nostalgic zing for me. Honestly, I almost expected to glimpse myself in some of the crowd shots of people gathered on the margins of I-5 near the Cowlitz River (I was there with my family).

What a hoot, though, to see Rollen Frederick Stewart aka Rainbow Man (that crazy guy who used to hold up the John 3:16 sign at sporting events while wearing a multi-colored afro wig) there amongst the onlookers. Man, that guy was EVERYWHERE!

There's a lot of great footage, too, of the volcano, the eruption and the aftermath, as one would expect from a video of this kind. A standout for me were the shots of all the ash that blew over the Cascades and inundated the farms there (I had relatives over there, too, and we visited them also).

A great vintage souvenir, for those who were there, as well as for those who weren't but would like to get a little closer to the experience. (Just not TOO close - BOOM!)",1338163200,,1287,4.487179487179487
8321421,5,6301144341,"This is a really interesting documentary about the eruption of Mount St. Helens. It's done with actual still shots and video shot just before, during and after the eruption itself. This is not a Hollywood mock-up, or a staged disaster film. It is a real-life depiction of what really happened on the mountain. The videotape was mastered using the graphics and video that were available at the time. The music is what was actually written about the eruption and performed at that time. I lived for several years just a few tens of kilometers from Mount St. Helens. I can say that this video is a realistic version of what it was like in the Pacific Northwest around 1980. My only regret is that a DVD version is not available.",1331510400,2,725,4.584615384615384
8321422,2,6301144341,"This collection of random shots of the mountain's eruption, coupled with comically melodramatic voiceover and a dated soundtrack, make this hard to watch.",1283731200,,154,5.739130434782608
