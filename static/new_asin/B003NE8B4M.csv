4157148,5,B003NE8B4M,"This is by far one of the best novels to screen adaptations I have ever seen of a anime, along with spice and wolf and Bleach from it manga. I am so glad that FUNimation is releasing it on Blu-ray. This show is good because it has action,drama, romance and A general disregard for blowing up school property. It's nice to have it on Blu-ray', and now sine the novels are complete and more coming out in the states, Kyoto animation should be getting around to continuing the show.

I recommend this show to any anime fan that loves high school drama with a Big twist.

This comes with a few extras on the discs, and the OVA. There is a simple menu selection on the discs, It is a very much a basic set but does have some extra with Author,director talking about making of the show.",1279152000,6,780,4.263513513513513

4157157,3,B003NE8B4M,"I wish I could give it higher marks I loved the show (personally I think it deserves at least 4/5) but these blu-rays... It started off great then as some episodes went on they had errors in them, and by errors I mean there were moments when the animation got real hazy and almost have a double image which made it hard to think I payed even the little over 30 dollars for it to be that bad -_-. I think I may be able to find certain bootlegs that would have better quality checks than this blu-ray set had. in honesty I would give the set a 2/5 but I'm a bit biased and loved the story so I gave it a 3/5, I would recommend finding a better alternative set to this one for anyone wanting to own this series as if your like me you will be disappointed in the consistant quality screw-ups.",1448236800,,788,4.0576923076923075

4157162,4,B003NE8B4M,"I didn't know much about Full Metal Panic! before buying the series on blu-ray. I got it because I heard it was pretty good and the price was really good for a full 26 episode show. FMP is a show that hits a lot of genres and themes, going back and forth from rather dark military fiction to wacky school hijinks to pretty soft sci-fi to action-thrillers. It may make it sound like the series is unfocused and disjointed, but it surprisingly fits rather well together. It does, however, play merry hell with the pacing, which is rather uneven all the way through aside from various 2-3 episode story arcs that fit into the season. The video and audio quality are top notch and don't look/sound like a slightly upgraded DVD. The special features are a bit lackluster, but the bar for anime extra features is so low that they don't really seem that bad.

An important thing to note is that although this is described as ""The Complete Series"", Full Metal Panic! is actually 3 different series and this item only has the first one. The second and third (Fumoffu? and Second Raid respectively) are not included with this set. It's not a deliberately misleading thing, but if you were buying this and expecting all of the Full Metal Panic anime, you're going to be disappointed. Aside from that potential problem, it's a really fun series at a really reasonable price point and I definitely recommend it.",1428624000,3,1398,4.637096774193548
4157163,4,B003NE8B4M,"I've been a Full Metal Panic fan since the original DVD release in 2003. It's really a particularly well done anime series, to the point where one doesn't necessarily have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate this particular series.

Story Review: This series has plenty of other reviews describing the story and plot (as does the rest of the internet), so I won't spend much time here. Each episode is a solid blend of comedy, drama, and ""mecha""/sci-fi action, while doing a great job at getting into the back stories of each character - most every ""why"" is answered, which is nice. Overall, it's clear that the writing stage wasn't skimped for more common tropes. While it might not appeal to everybody, those who are fans of Evangelion or Bubblegum Crisis may be polarized by the lighter feel; those who didn't might appreciate the tight integration with the non-mecha bits and better political intrigue.

Production review: English character voices are amongst the best for a dubbed anime series. While Chris Patton, Hillary Haag, and Luci Christian are frequently heard throughout Funimation's DVD dubs, they seem to have a particularly good chemistry here. Purists will likely switch to the Japanese audio track regardless, but the voice talents of the English version do the series plenty of justice. The animation is well done, each scene having a good atmosphere and a very consistent quality. The CGI parts do stand out, but they seem almost intentionally so; they stand out, but are not shoehorned where they don't belong.

Physical Product Review (DVD): I bought volumes 6 and 7 at $25 a pop new, and 1-3 used for $10-15 each, when they were still sold that way. I bought it again because I never got discs 4 and 5, and I can't find disc 1, so for the price, individual discs simply weren't worth it. $35 for the complete series was definitely a steal, but not without a handful of tradeoffs. There are no posters in the box (each original volume came with one), and there aren't nearly as many art galleries to enjoy as bonus features. Subtitles are in English only; I'd have to look if the original discs came with Spanish or French. The video kept its 4:3 size, which means that there was no cropping of the picture from the original release (awesome), but widescreen displays will have the normal black bars on either side (boo!). There was clearly some effort put into restoration; the animation has a bit more contrast and saturation than the original discs. The four disc set is certainly more convenient than the seven I used to have, but my shelf looks a bit empty - whether two half-width DVD cases is a blessing or a curse depends on how prominent a display you prefer. The DVD's lost a star because, while the original ones did not contain CSS copy protection, these ones do. I understand piracy and all that, but the content has been on the market for ten years without it, so I don't feel it was really doing anyone any good.

For $35, the series is definitely worth owning on DVD if you haven't already seen it.",1428105600,,3040,4.666044776119403

4157171,4,B003NE8B4M,"So this is an old series that still stands the testament of time.  I'm biased, because I personally adore the series and there are definitely reasons to buy it.
For the $20-30 it costs for a whole blu-ray show, that's not bad.  And considering the future blu-ray packs are the same price, you can drop $60 on the entire blu-ray series - which isn't too shabby considering the price some of us paid for the whole thing when it was first released.
Video wise, it's fairly sharp.  Keep in mind this season was animated when all broadcast TV's were still 4:3 screen ratio, and the blu-ray's keep this ratio.  Granted they have been upscaled to fit the modern HDTV it still retains the 4:3 scale, so you'll have black bars on the left/right of your TV.  This is a better choice than trying to stretch to widescreen and ruin it.  I haven't watched the ADV release in years for a picture quality comparison, but considering I'm watching this on a 65"" HDTV with very few instances of the images getting pixelated (and even then you won't notice unless you're looking for it), I'd say it's a win.

Audio is fairly typical, english 5.1 and japanese 2.0.  Both use a surround system (if you have one) fairly well, as the audio has been touched up, but since it wasn't a theatre release, it doesn't fully utilize 5.1.

New or old fans, spending $25 on this box is a deal you can't go wrong with.",1409184000,,1383,4.434782608695652

In addition to combating and obliterating terrorist groups the Mithril organization also takes a keen interest in protecting people known as the whispered. The whispered are mysteriously born possessing knowledge of highly advanced technology and weaponry. As a result the whispered are being targeted by nefarious individuals and groups who wish to obtain this knowledge to serve their own agendas.

When the Mithril organization learns that an unsuspecting high school girl is being targeted they send one of their top guys to protect her there is only one problem... the man they've chosen may have a brilliant military mind, but he is completely socially inept. The series blends comedy, drama and action together with expert precision transitioning from comedy hijinks to dramatic dilemmas that culminate in amazing action sequences.

4157185,5,B003NE8B4M,I have had some bad anime picks recently and so my expectations for this series were mixed. The first few episodes are a bit silly as the characters establish themselves. The absurdity of having a trigger happy veteran sergeant be a schoolboy body guard takes a while to wear off but does have some funny moments. Once the plot gets going it swings along mixing good characterization with a variety of action. It manages to be fun and suspenseful without falling prey to mindless fan service. Treat the first two or three episodes with skepticism and then be prepared to enjoy a well thought out consistent anime. Highly recommended.,1381363200,,633,4.81651376146789

Two chicks fawning over the same guy, and he'd rather clean his weapon than be alone with either one. He's more comfortable killing than kissing.

From there a good action and comedy story takes place. This season is more on the action side which doesn't take away from the fact that it is a great show.

If you are into the comedic aspects then watching or purchasing Full Metal Panic!? Fumoffu is for you, not much action in that series.

The animation is great for having been produced in 2002, especially compared to shows being produced at the time With that let me discuss the reason for the title above, while the english dub sounds good and no actor is bad, I personally felt that Sousuke's personality and the fact that he is oblivious to everything he is doing wrong is lost with the english dub. Even with the Japanese audio being in stereo I would say stick with that, but if you dislike reading subtitles then the english audio is perfectly fine.

I really enjoy when a show or anime can blend together multiple genres and make a successful final product, the only genre that ends up lacking a little bit is the romance but that is a result of the characters personalities and interactions aka Sousuke is again oblivious to everything not military related.

4157227,3,B003NE8B4M,"I bought this series based on positive reviews I had read including some here on Amazon but I found the series to be mediocre. I've seen Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Samurai 7, and The Fullmetal Alchemist (First Series, not the recently remade one). These are excellent series that I thoroughly enjoyed, Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop being legendary in the anime genre.

Full Metal Panic! is the first series I felt was actually mediocre and did not live up to the positive reviews I had read. It took me about 14 episodes of viewing before I felt like I was getting into it, but even after I started to care a bit about the series I didn't care a whole lot.

The main problem is that the all of the characters are one-dimensional. The main characters Kaname and Sousuke do start to be developed later on but for the most part they remain one-dimensional. The main villain of the series is even worse, he is as cheesy and one-dimensional as they come. The music isn't anything to write home about either, some of it is decent and some of it is cheesy. The actual animation is the best part of the series.

Overall this high school romantic/comedy/action series relies on a formula that gets old after a while. Sousuke is a military guy who approaches every part of his life as if it were a mission, which leads him into some slapstick humor. Kaname is the high school girl with beauty, charm, and smarts. The romance takes place between Sousuke and Kaname and the main villain is evil just for the sake of being evil, oh and to make some money too. That's the formula of the series and I didn't think the creators did enough with it or develop the characters enough.

If you are looking for something that has some real substance then you should look elsewhere. The series I listed at the beginning are all much better than this series. If you are a hardcore anime fan and you've gone through most of the top quality anime out there then you might want to give this a shot as it's not a bad series, it's just not an exceptional series and there are many exceptional anime series out there.

*edit*

I just finished watching season two of this series and I was pleasantly surprised. The creators actually got around to exploring the characters themselves which I felt was missing in the first series. As someone who really enjoys anime, I will have to say that it is worth watching the first season to lead you into an excellent second season.",1292198400,3,2468,4.534831460674157
4157228,5,B003NE8B4M,"If you are an avid anime fan and enjoy action/drama/comedy series then this is for you!  Though it is now several years old, the series is still in my top 10 or 20 of all time.  The balance of drama, action, and comedy is well done and the characters are genuinely likable.

Other reviews and the synopsis cover the plot and events pretty well, but if you are a fan of military style anime with some fan service thrown in then definitely pick this up.

I recommend watching with the Japanese dialogue and English subtitles.  Souske's Japanese voice is PERFECT!  I also recommend a 13+ age for viewing as a lot of the humor is slightly 'flirty' in nature and young audiences won't get a lot of the humor.",1292025600,12,703,4.410852713178294
4157229,4,B003NE8B4M,"Here's the deal: every single episode of Full Metal Panic, including Fumoffuu and The Second Raid, is downright amazing. The tsukkomi nature of Sousuke and Chidori is hilarious, and mixing this comedy with mecha battles and an interesting story makes for a really great anime series. I can't reccomend it enough.

That being said, The Second Raid evolution to Blu-Ray meant a complete redrawing of the series to update it to 1080p. This means that the studio sat down, re-drew every single frame from the whole season, added 5.1 Dolby sound, and released it. It is AMAZING. What they did here, on the other hand... was simply upscale the original video (and add the 5.1 sound, although I'm almost sure the japanese track is 2.1). What does this mean? It means that the aspect ratio is stuck at 4:3 (square image), as opposed to the 16:9 ratio (widescreen) of all HDTVs. Also, quality can't even compare, since upscaling video and re-drawing are completely different things.

Amazon mentions on the product description ""Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1"", but I had no idea it meant a square image. I was confident that I was going to get the very same quality I got from Second Raid, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Do note that Fumoffuu is exactly the same 4:3 aspect ratio, so you have been warned.

So, is it worth it? I couldn't really tell. It still looks really nice on my 32-inch LG, and surely the DVD version would look worse on bigger sets. I think that, at its current retail price, it is still a worthy addition to anyone's anime collection. Just don't get upset when you don't get the expected quality for a Blu-Ray.",1290124800,,1619,4.693661971830986

4157231,5,B003NE8B4M,"Here it is, the first series out of three in the Full Metal Panic anime franchise in full HD! Witness how Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori first met and how the action and humorous hijinks ensues(and continues on). The insane, off the wall comedy will at times have you literally almost rolling on the group and the intense Mecha action and drama on the battlefield will hit home. Anyway, on with the review.

Video:

Although this is a blu-ray remastered release, oddly it's in 4x3, full screen aspect ratio instead of the usual 16x9, widescreen aspect ratio used in high definition media. This means you have to manually configure your TV's aspect ratio to widescreen(16x9) if you want to get rid of the black bars on the left and right sides of the screen, if your TV or blu-ray player doesn't do this automatically. I really don't see why they did this for the blu-ray release. Maybe they couldn't get the rights to the full HD remaster of the series. Who know. Anyhow, aside from that, the video quality is really good. The colors are vibrant, the outlines on the characters, mecha, and etc are very sharp. You don't get any kind of blurry, hazy, or distorted parts whatsoever in any of the episodes.

Audio:

The HD audio remastering of this version is really good like a lot of blu-ray conversions of once DVD only material. The music is more powerful and clear, the sound effects are more powerful and crisp. Also, the quality of the character's voices was a lot clearer and more dynamic. These are to expected from blu-ray audio, though. The better your audio set up for your TV is, the closer you get to the ""theater-like"" sound experience.

Story:

Well, what can I say? It's over the top comedy fused with Mecha action and drama. You get a little bit of everything in this show. Scenes where you will laugh really hard, scenes where you will be gripping the edge of your seat/chair/couch/etc, scenes where you will feel the pain the characters are feeling, and scenes where you will feel warm and fuzzy inside. A very brilliant story, indeed. It has enough mechs and action to drawn in the mecha/action anime fans, enough comedy and romance to attract the comedy and romantic comedy anime fans, and enough gripping drama to lure the drama and ""thought provoking"" anime fans. A hardcore warrior-minded mercenary boy clueless to the ways of normal, every day civilian life meets violent, tomboy-ish (somewhat)normal civilian girl clueless to the ways of life on the battlefield was never portrayed as well as this. Definitely a must see for any anime fan.",1287792000,3,2566,4.72930648769575
4157232,5,B003NE8B4M,"Full Metal Panic is a wonderful story filled with all the  elements that makes it a great story. It has action,comedy,drama and a little romance in strange little way. The story has mechs but they don't overwhelm the story. The story's main character Sagara Sousake is a military genius who works for an organization known as Mithrill. An excellent soldier, Sousake finds himself guarding a young woman named Kaname from evil organizations that want to exploit the whispered( People mostly teenagers who have secrets of highly advanced technology hidden within them called Black Technology)These organizations will stop at nothing to gain that technology and thus the storyline.

Sousake and kaname are hiliarious together and the supporting cast is just as witty and times comical. There's also much action and drama to the story as well. This is a story I recommend to anyone who enjoys a well rounded story with thought out characters.",1286236800,,938,5.124183006535947
4157233,5,B003NE8B4M,"I won't go into too much details about the plot as the description covers it or you can check it up on Funi's main page.  For the price I paid for of 33 USD this was a steal I mean the series is half a decade old already but the transition from SD (watched it as fansubs) to Bluray quality is a huge difference.  I can't say much for the subbing as they seem on-par for the most part as I only have 2 years of Japanese during high school and let's say it is really rusty.  If you have watched this series and loved it I definitely recommend picking this up but if not this anime has great action, comedy, and a little drama.

BTW a little side note don't ask me about the dubs as I believe dubs are always horrible the only exception is Gundam Wing, Escaflowne, Robotech(well duh since it is an Americanized Macross), Guyver(not the new one, the original one), Ghost in the Shell, and Samurai Pizza Cats(though I ain't even sure this even came out in Japan).  I'm pretty sure there's a few out there that I missed but these I know for sure.",1284768000,,1040,4.18
4157234,4,B003NE8B4M,"Sousuke Sagara is a seventeen year old military specialist with an interesting mission - become a high school student in order to protect Kaname Chidori, who is a ""Whispered"", a person unknowingly in possession of ""Black Technology"". Unfortunately, while very knowledgeable of military subjects, Sousuke completely lacks basic social skills. Also working against him is the very thing that makes him a good soldier, a healthy paranoia and quick reflexes, which results in many a innocent student at gunpoint. While Sousuke is intent on guarding Kaname from terrorists, she works hard to protect the school from Sousuke!

I started this series without any expectations, and I must say I was quiet pleasantly surprised. Sousuke is quiet an ernest, likable character and Kaname isn't as annoying as I had expected her. Over time I even grew rather fond of her. Sousuke's social inaptitude is the focus of most of the humor, but wasn't too overdone. He does seem incredible dense sometime, but you have to keep in mind the environment that he was raised in, and take into account that he doesn't really care about social correctness and doesn't make much of an effort to learn. The balance between military missions and high school social life is well done and provide an entertaining contrast.

I tried watching this show in English for an episode and then gave up and switched to Japanese, which was much better. Sousuke's voice actor in particular did a very good job. The English dub isn't too bad, the Japanese is just much better.

4157235,2,B003NE8B4M,"**(CONTAIN SPOILERS)**

This series has an interesting concept and starts promisingly. It follows the story of a 17-year-old Sergeant Sousuke Sagara who works for an anti-terrorist military group called Mithril and is assigned to protect another 17-year-old, the most popular girl in high school, Kaname from some unknown dangers (Later we will understand why and who is targeting her). The funny part is our hero Sousuke was raised in the military, and despite of being an excellent soldier, he has absolutely no social skills.  In order to secretly protect Kaname from danger, Sousuke takes on an undercover mission by enrolling to Kaname's high school, you can probably figure out the rest by yourself, he then overreacts every little thing at school and creates all sorts of comedic absurdity, misunderstandings and troubles for the whole class, teacher and of course the hot-headed Kaname who especially can't stand his lack of common sense, later gradually develops a feeling for him.

That is the general introduction to the first several episodes and the show reaches its peak when Kaname finally got kidnapped and Sousuke went on a dangerous battle to save her. These episodes are thrilling and done pretty well; however, after this rescue mission is over; all the bad guys have been supposedly killed and apparently there are no more enemies will chase after kaname, the fun suddenly stops. The rest of the episodes seem to go backward by following the exact same formula from the beginning again.  Sousuke goes back to become the socially-retarded undercover high school student and continue to create comedic troubles for everyone at school even though his original mission is finished and the organization (Mitril) got no evidence to suggest that kaname will be targeted again. This part really disappoints me as the creator failed to come up with different and better concepts.  The plots should've moved on and been more creative about the future storylines instead of continuing relying on the same old jokes. Sousuke is a highly skillful Sergeant who works for the anti-terrorist organization, so why can't he be assigned to do another different or more dangerous secret mission besides going back to babysit that spoiled-little princess Kaname again? It's so illogical, unconvincing and wasteful for a talented soldier like Sousuke.

On top of that the creator failed to prove the connection between Kaname and the second mission, which begins from ep. 8-12. I mean why is she even needed in these episodes besides making the audience to see how she gets jealous and violent on Sousuke? The second mission doesn't even revolve around her and frankly we are forced to see more kaname's annoying temper than actions. I understand romance is part of the big concept in this series, but these episodes involved Kaname and Sousuke is neither romantic nor sensible. I guess its purpose is to create some childish comedic relief but let's be honest, haven't we seen enough jokes like this in the beginning episodes already?

Furthermore, I find it hard to believe Sousuke, a skillful soldier who is capable of mastering all sort of highly-advanced technologies yet has a hard time adapting to normal life. The jokes about him being the most clueless guy in the world are quite refreshing in the beginning, but his character never grows throughout the whole series, which is quite disappointing. Even a 5-year-old is able to learn a few things about life after his/her parents teach him/her; but Sousuke never learns and acts exactly like the same way from before in the end.

Lastly, the character Tessa has to be the most annoying one in the show. She is the 16-year-old Captain of Mithril, yet couldn't hold a gun to defend herself to save her own life. She's childish, prudish, over-polite, pacific and lacks of confidence. Although I have some problems with concepts like a teen leading a bunch of grow-ups in a military organization (I just don't buy it), my biggest problem is that the creator couldn't give us a convincing answer how could someone so weak could take up the position of the captain of the anti-terrorist organization. To me this position doesn't suit her one bit, but the creator tried too hard to prove she worths it, which shows in the filler episode (13) where a silly argument breaks out between she and Mellisa Mao, who then challenges her to an AS duel. The outcome proved to be less satisfactory and unconvincing rather than Tessa is a big crybaby.

The music and graphics score very high in this series. The opening and closing songs are very catchy and the drawings are quite beautiful, detailed and fluids. But that's about it.

All in all, although this series doesn't impress me much in many ways, I would still recommend this one to anyone who enjoys mecha, romance and slapstick comedy. However, I would not recommend it to anyone who ages under 12 since it contains moderate violence, mild profanity and some brief nudity.
