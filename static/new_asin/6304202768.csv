814628,1,6304202768,"Have you ever been in a situation where you want to do several things but you become so uncertain as to what to do you wind up doing nothing?
That is the problem with Boys.  Is it going to be a crime drama?  A teenage sex comedy?  A coming of age film?  A youth in revolt film?
Whoever made the film could not decide what it was supposed to be about, end result it does a little of everything, and a lot of nothing!
It is a classic jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none situation.

814629,3,6304202768,"Winona Ryder stars in this film about a woman with a dark secret who meets and ultimately falls in love with a young prep school boy.  Ryder stars as Patty Vare, a woman who was thrown from her horse while riding and knocked unconscious.  She is discovered by two young boys from a local boys' prep school.  The young boys get help from John ""Sonny"" Baker, an older boy at the school, played by Lukas Haas.  Patty hides out in John's room while John does his best to keep her hidden from his friends and the administrators.
Unknown to John, Patty is hiding a dark secret.  She was at a party the night before her riding accident and a police officer, played by John C. Reilly, has been coming around and asking a lot of questions.  Patty was introduced to Bud Valentine (Skeet Ulrich).  Bud is a star baseball pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The two have a little too much to drink and end up stealing a car.  Patty then sees a picture in the car and recognizes who the car belongs to from the picture.  She decides that she wants out, and this is where the accident occurs.
Meanwhile, John has developed strong feelings for Patty.  He takes one of the school's cars and they go to the county fair.  However, officer Curry is there and he questions John about Patty.  John talks to Patty about this, and Patty takes John to the scene of the accident.  Later, the police take Patty to headquarters for questioning, along with John and his family.  At the end, John and Patty leap into the elevator together and drive away.
I thought this movie was good overall, but I found it hard to follow.  Patty's flashbacks to the party took away from the plot a little, and I didn't care for John's friends too much.  I still think people would like this movie, it's just not one of Ryder's best works.",1044316800,4,1796,4.410334346504559
814630,5,6304202768,"She was so good in it. Haas kind of sucked(a little too dorkey_) but overall a very understated movie.
Beautiful scenery and solid supporting roles by Skeet Ulrich make this a must have for any Winonna fan.",1008633600,,206,4.594594594594595

7865617,4,6304202768,"This was a typical coming of age, sexual awakening teen movie.  But well done.  NO real nudity, to speak of, rather replace with a actual real story line,  Which is kinda refreshing among so many teen coming of sexual awakening age movies. Either that or I just Winona Ryder than, now, and probably in her future paintings of film.",1396051200,,331,4.576271186440678
7865618,3,6304202768,"This isn't one of Winona's best movies. She will probably tell you that yourself. She even tried to get out of it after a script revision (something about a sex scene---and if you follow Winona's career like I do---she doesn't base her career on being sexy)but was threatened to get sued.

Oddly enough, I still find myself watching this movie from time to time. Its got a great cinematography and a great soundtrack. Ok, plus, I'm a die-hard Winona fan. No shoplifting scandal or a bad movie choice can ever change that. LOL!

Oh yeah---this is based on the James Salter short ""Twenty Minutes"", which I read and actually thought a better story than the movie.",1354147200,,660,4.681034482758621
7865619,4,6304202768,"I like Winona Ryder, so I gave this movie a try. It has a ""Graduate"" kind of humor about an unconventional love story, though a younger boy lead.  Lucas Haas, Skeet Ulrich, Chris Cooper, Jessica Harper, Catherine Keener, John C. Reilly., and others make a great cast. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it and liked the unpredictable ending.
Maybe the politically correct monitors dumped on this movie to make it less than it was. Maybe that is why no one saw it. I certainly enjoyed it.",1336348800,3,490,4.50561797752809

7865621,3,6304202768,"Winona Ryder (Heathers, Mr. Deeds) winds up in the hands of school boy Lukas Haas (Mars Attacks!, Witness) after she falls off her horse and knocks herself unconscious in a field. Haas goes to an all boy school and he tries to hide her from his classmates...he doesnt like school. Ryder is hiding from the cops because their investigating on a baseball player named Bud Valentine, played by Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Chill Factor) and the last person to see him was Ryder and also threw the movie we see flashbacks from her night with Ulrich and what happened to him. Alright story has its lulls here and there but what anchors it is the performances by Haas and Ryder but the ending sorta is put on for a happy yay feeling which I didn't like. Also starring Chris Cooper (Jarhead, Adaptation), John C. Reilly (The Aviator, Dark Water), Catherine Keener (The 40 Yeard Old Virgin, Interpreter) and James LeGros (Near Dark, Just Looking).",1130889600,5,932,4.723926380368098

What I am looking for is the name of that one hot blonde dude that was a friend of John Baker's in this movie? Also, where can I find some pics of him? Anyone know, please e-mail me at icycool7227@aol.com. Thanks!!",1074384000,,340,4.166666666666667
