1634371,3,B00005NKSB,"Personally I think this is the best slasher film for a while. It has a great atmosphere, goods performances and good direction. May I suggest watching this film with the subtitles and in French the way it was intended. Most people I guess just don't get it especially the French themselves. They absolutely slate the film. At least Brian Yuzna (an Absolute genius himself) like this film. Goes to show great minds think alike.",1056672000,3,426,4.77027027027027
1634372,4,B00005NKSB,"Surpisingly good french movie, where everyone is not what he/she seems to be. This stylish sleeper is far superior to those teen-slasher flicks where everything is too obvious and there are too many explanations. Erotic, really intriguing and extremely ambiguous, ""Deep in the woods"" is a potential cult-movie from a 27-yrs-old director. In some ways, between Dario Argento and David De Coteau, with echoes from Mario Bava e Jean Rollin.",1023062400,10,437,5.257142857142857

1634374,3,B00005NKSB,"As teen-slasher movies go, I've seen a lot better, but for a French horror flick, it was a masterpiece.  French horror movies usually make me shiver, but sometimes not for the reasons the director intended.
The original French language version of this film is better - the English dubbing on this one sounds a lot like the actors called it in on cell phones - but if you don't speak French, I'd recommend watching the French track with subtitles. The subtitles give a pretty accurate translation of the original - and the photography and directing make suffering them much less painful.
By the way, the original French version, ""Promenons-nous dans les Bois,"" takes its title and underlying theme from a popular French children's song of the same name.  The song sort of helps tie the movie together, but as they say ""it was lost in the translation.""",1018483200,4,850,4.775510204081633
1634375,1,B00005NKSB,"I think personally that this was the worst movie ever made! The dubbing from french to english was horrible. The movie made absolute no sense. This is the type of movie that you get for someone you do not like. ... Axel(who I might add was thought to have died [early] on in the movie...) has a split personality disorder... There is also a little boy who is quite the little [strange one]. For no apparent reason he stabs himself at the dinner table during his own birthday party. Then there is a mute actress who is also a lesbian, i still haven't figured out the reason for her. But she does have a really cool seen(no hints but it was the best part). And i think that the director put it in the beginning to keep the watcher(in this case a horny teenager) ""tuned in."" All-in-all it is the worst film i have ever seen!",1014163200,,821,4.269230769230769
1634376,1,B00005NKSB,"Stupid comparisons aside, this is your average, pretentious and artsy European offering (ie, when they are bad, they get *this* bad). With its Angela Carteresque overtones and its nods to everything from Dario Argento to the latest American teen flick (The Forsaken in Paris, maybe?), Deep in the Woods is to be avoided at all costs.

1634399,3,B00005NKSB,"With stylish settings, obscure motivations, and a suspenseful atmosphere where not much that happens makes much sense, Deep In The Woods (2000) is a French production dubbed in English, that kind of plays out like an Argento style giallo, as a troupe of five actors journeys to an isolated house in the country to give a performance for a wealthy man and his grandson.

Axel de Fersen (Francois Berleand, Inspector Tarconi from the Transporter films) owner of a fabulous estate, has hired the troupe as a surprise birthday gift for his grandson Nicholas (Thibault Truffert).  The show, a variation of Little Red Riding Hood, includes a performer in a wolf costume.  The play seems a little upsetting to young Nicholas, who seems to be in a trace or perpetual state of shock.  At dinner after the show, the boy deliberately stabs himself in the hand with a folk.  Alex tells his guests not to worry, and expresses an interest in Frederick  Vincent Lecoeur), one of the actors, inviting him to his bedroom.

Not a lot is revealed about the performers.  Sophie (Clotilde Courau) and the mute Jean (Alexia Stresi), are sometime lesbian lovers, while Mathew (Clement Sibony) and Matilda (Maud Buquet) are also romantically involved, although these relationships appear to be subject to change.

Weird things begin to happen, as an obnoxious cop (Michel Muller) mysteriously appears, looking for a serial rapist.  In another nonsensical turn, the members of the group are suddenly wandering in the woods, providing the opportunity for some jump scares and moonlight sex.

The first kill occurs in a shower, with the killer dressed in the wolf costume.  With one of their party missing, the group also finds that their host has vanished, their car disabled, and the phone out of order.  A spectacular kill featuring a speeding arrow, sends them into a full panic.  After locking up Stefan (Denis Lavant) the estate's gamekeeper, they make plans to leave with Nicholas in de Fersen's car, but things don't go quite go as planned.

Darkly atmospheric and well photographed, Deep In The Woods is scary in places, but suffers from the lack of a coherent plot.  Emphasizing style over substance, the violent and stylish kills are effective, but the various pieces don't fit together in a sensible way.  The mostly shallow characters don't behave realistically, and aren't very likeable.  The dialog is often ridiculous, and the vocal dub frequently sounds comical, and makes assessing the acting performances a little difficult.  Still, the cast seems to deliver what director Lionel Delplanque was going for.  Finishing with a flurry of dramatic kills and a big surprise reveal, the film has many of the qualities common to Italian giallos, including a creepy kid and a masked killer.  If a more modern take on the giallo genre has some appeal, you might want to give this movie a watch.",1318723200,,2876,4.97489539748954
1634400,3,B00005NKSB,"Deep In The Woods was beautifully shot and had a few good moments but over all it was a bit slow moving and didn't make a lot of sense. It was a take on Little Red Riding Hood,I got that,but they threw in a lot of meaningless symbolism that only lent to the confusion.
The kills were few and weak to say the least.coincidentally There is a rapist/killer loose in the area that preys on young women. Herein lies he question,Is the person that is bumping off these twenty somethings the Terror on the loose afore mentioned,is it the the man in the wolf costume or is he one in the same or maybe it's someone else with a vendetta dressing as the Big bad wolf?
The mystery aspect is the best part of this film besides the lovely atmospheric look and feel of it. All in all I say it's ok,but I wouldn't watch it again.",1299283200,,813,4.1847133757961785

Put them in an absurd situation that no one with any intelligence would walk into.  Deprive them all of any remaining ounces of common sense they have.  Have them disappear one by one.  Distract them from figuring out who the killer is, even though we have long since done so.  Shake, don't stir.  Yadda yadda yadda.

It is impossible to get past the incredibly poor dubbing to watch this, and I watch foreign horror whenever a good one comes out. This ain't it. Save your money and rent something - anything - but this. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",1269043200,,386,4.608695652173913
1634403,4,B00005NKSB,"I completely missed this film when it first came out and was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across its existence recently. I originally assumed from the Artisan DVD package design that this was yet another low budget american Scream wanna-be production and ignored it but this turns out actually to be a quite satisfying french (belgian?) Scream wanna-be production. For me, euro good, though I know there are those who don't respond well to foreign films of any sort, horror included: euro bad. But euro horror tends in my general experience to be more atmospheric and often pays much more attention to visual details and style in filmmaking than american horror (and often tries to do more with subtext); logic does tend to take a back seat to effect of course. You can tell right off from the first sequence that there is a strong Argento influence in this film, and I spotted various references, perhaps intentional tributes or maybe just unconscious influences, throughout to lots of euro horror classics.

The main reason to watch this film is in the execution; there isn't anything here you haven't seen before but it's done much better here than usual. For anybody who values storytelling technique in horror films, you should find much to your liking here. The suspense is built very nicely and some of the deaths are first rate in my view. The actors are generally pretty appealing and there is a refreshing lack of comedy and irony in this movie. Rather, in springboarding off the little red riding hood tale, the film tries to go for a more serious dream-nightmare fable feel. My problem with comedy and irony in horror these days is that it tends to mean that the filmmakers are making excuses for themselves, building in a defense against criticism, rather than trying hard. (You mean you took us seriously? But it's all just a joke these kinds of movies, don't you know.)  The ending is a bit too positive for my tastes, as tends to be the case nowadays, so I am docking it a star, sorry to say.

I strongly recommend that you watch this movie widescreen (in the dark of course) and go with the subtitled french audio rather than the dub, which is, as usual, pretty poorly done. For euro horror fans, definitely have a look.",1173571200,3,2245,4.721938775510204
1634404,4,B00005NKSB,"Very well-made and underappreciated cryptic horror movie about a small group of performers hired to stage a private play for a strange family of rich recluses 'deep in the woods'.  Very mysterious, with a unique strain of eerie sinister tension running throughout.  On a much less dark note, features a hot girl-on-girl scene that wins lots of bonus points for being not just a sex scene but actually a very affectionate bona fide Love Scene (albeit rather on the brief side).  Other appreciated scenery includes the lush, absolutely gorgeous forest within which the movie takes place, captured well by very fine cinematography.  Somehow placing the subtle menace in the midst of such beauty makes it seem all the more dangerous.  An ambiguous film that could go in pretty much any direction it wanted if it were to have a sequel.  Should appeal to fans of everything from ""The Blair Witch Project"" to ""Friday The 13th"" to ""Raising Cain"".",1100995200,6,938,4.905063291139241
1634405,5,B00005NKSB,"Reminding me many times of Susperia due to the fairy tale atmosphere, this movie is a must-see if you love Argento.  The movie has amazing camera work and although the gore isn't crazy, there is some to keep you satisfied. It has a lot of straight up eerie aspects that create a kind of dreamlike quality to the movie.

The english dubbing is a bit annoying at first but you get used to it. i would use subtitles but i only have the VHS.

This movie blows away all the recent american slasher flicks.",1095120000,6,500,4.297872340425532
1634406,5,B00005NKSB,"I've seen mostly negative reviews here about this film, I really don't think americans get it. So bombarded with ""scary action horror comedies"" like THE MUMMY or the new DAWN OF THE DEAD, the modern American perception of horror is a ""non-threatening boo"" with no substance. Another great example of modern american ""horror"" is 13 Ghosts which was ruined by a jive talking, step'n'fetchit maid.
That said, this movie is different. It's very artistic and truly gothic in a surreal Argento way. Of course it had slow spots and faults, but for a first time director, low budget and in France?! I loved it and was shocked by sequences and respected it AND was inspired by it. That's so much more than I've gotten from films over here for the last 25 years.",1081468800,11,752,4.661654135338346

7947324,3,B00005NKSB,"Deep In The Woods a.k.a. Promenons-Nous Dans Les Bois is a 2000 French horror/slasher film

The film opens with a mother reading Little Red Riding Hood to her child one night. When she finishes, her child witnesses her murder, as she's strangled with piano wire. A short time later, 5 actors/actresses Wilfried, Matthieu, Sophie, Mathilde, Jeanne are in route to perform Little Red Riding Hood at the castle of Axel de Fersen; out in the deep country of France for his grandson's birthday. Axel is a wealthy man who is confined to or at least spends most of his time in a wheelchair and has his gamekeeper, Stephane Baron Berland, help him around.

Following the performance of Little Red Riding Hood, the group decide to party to celebrate. The celebration starts off well until the police comes by and gives them warning that their searching for a murderer who's on the loose and believed to be close within the area. Upon hearing the terrifying news, the gang of actors/actresses decide the best and safest thing to do is to stay inside over night. But sometimes, inside is where the most danger lies. And as members of the group go missing and someone in a wolf costume begins slaying people around the mansion, things become chaotic and everyone begins to wonder who the killer is and if they can even trust each other. But who is this killer? Is it Stephane? Is it Axel? Or is it one of the actors/actresses themselves?

Overall: Deep In The Woods was a standard film for the French horror genre. The performance of most of the characters in the film is fairly admirable and the plot is somewhat cliche but it's interesting nonetheless that comes with an unseen plot twist nearing the final 15-20 minutes of the movie. Many criticize Deep In The Woods for not being scary but fail to realize that horror films are not always about trying to scare you, especially not in slasher films which is what Deep In The Woods is. It does however deliver at being creepy and eerie for most of its duration. The DVD contains a nice variety of features such as an interactive menu, audio commentary, the theatrical trailer, biographies of the cast and filmmaker, and the option of watching the film either in the original French language that it was filmed in or with the English language dubbed over in the film. Overall I give Deep In The Woods a 3/5 stars as a decent French horror film to enjoy. Remember this is a slasher-horror, not a jump out at you and scare you-horror; so depending on what your definition of a horror film is will decide whether or not you enjoy this",1429488000,,2570,4.606986899563319

The movie starts off with a woman telling a bed time by a fireplace to an unseen baby in a bed then gives the unseen baby a doll.  Then the movie flashes into today's time and a small group of actors/friends gets hired by an eccentric wealthy man to perform a rendition of Little Red Riding Hood for his grandson's birthday party.  When they arrive on the premisis they are greated by an odd gamesmith who works for the man who hired them.  When they get to the house the discover the man who hired them is equally odd and also that the party consists of him and the grandson.  The man who hired them for some reason repeatedly addresses one particular member in the acting troupe as Sederic when his name is Frederic...However, the young actor continues to respond to the wrong name instead of correcting the man.  Also, the man seems to feel very comfortable with Frederic and asks him to basically tuck him into bed and read him a story....at this particular point in time I would think the Frederic character would draw the line; however, Frederic went right along with the old man.  Also, one member of the acting group if mute and bisexual and honestly I am not sure what her character is doing in the movie.  The mute bisexual doesn't appar in the performance the actors are putting on and her longest scene is when she is having sex with her girlfriend.  Apparantly, when they are having sex they are also being watched and photographed by an unidentified person.  The viewer isn't given any reason for the photography...I guess we just assume he is a pervert rapist.  The grandson, Nicholas, is also rather odd.  Nicholas doesn't really speak or have facial gestures.  Nicholas just sorta stands/sits with a blank look on his face for most of the movie.  Again, the viewer isn't given a reason as to why the child acts that way.  Also, the killer and the reason behind the killings is rather lame.  Actually, considering the death scenes the viewer can figure out that the character didn't die and there is a difference between the killer's initial death scene and the other death scenes.  So yeah we figured out the killer early on....so it wasn't very much of a who done it for us.  The character of the police officer was off, he seemed more like a young guy wanting to party than a respected officer of the law.

The movie was boring in some spots and never built up any since of horror/suspense.  There were not any scares nor was there alot of gore.  The acting was pretty lackluster and the voice over in English made it worse.  The characters were lackluster and the reasoning behind their actions was rather lame.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars:  I liked the setting, the views through the keyhole were rather different and the wolf costume was stylish.",1323302400,,2863,4.5360623781676415
