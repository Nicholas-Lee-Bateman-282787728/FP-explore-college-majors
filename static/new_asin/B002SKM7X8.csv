8379426,4,B002SKM7X8,"Because this is a British import of a series, set in the Irish district of Manchester, England (which has a distinct, difficult to understand accent if you're an American), you really have to watch this with the subtitles on to catch all the dialogue. Yet only about a third of what is said is subtitled, unlike watching the episodes on Sundance channel, which captures all the dialogue spoken in closed captioning. For a DVD set costing over $126. US, the DVD manufacturer could have spent a little more money making the subtitles complete, finishing sentences and not leaving many sentences out completely.",1283126400,10,608,4.970588235294118
