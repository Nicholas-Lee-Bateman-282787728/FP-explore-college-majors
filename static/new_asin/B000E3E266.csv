2485701,4,B000E3E266,"While still informative, you would expect more from such a respected source. I think much more emphasis needs to be placed on the construction of the grow room itself. More time is spent on the plant itself than how to actually grow it, which is the idea behind the plot.",1187827200,10,271,4.44
2485702,5,B000E3E266,"If you are a first time grower this video is a must!  If you are an experienced grower you will find some new tricks and it is a great reference tool ~smiles~.

Although, it lacks in hydroponics (which his 2nd DVD takes care of) everything else is top notch.  Jorge even shows you step by step how to make a top of the line grow area with Visqueen, 2x2's, etc.",1187827200,4,360,4.114285714285714

2485704,5,B000E3E266,Overall a good dvd. I expected more from Jorge having read his book The Indoor Bible. I think this dvd will be perfect for beginner culivation. Its fun and easy to pick up on but might be a bit boring for a more experienced growers.,1137024000,24,232,4.177777777777778

2485734,2,B000E3E266,"Very poorly made. Tried to stuff too much information into a 100 min. DVD.  The book ""Marijuana Horticulture The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible"" by Jorge Cervantes, will give you much more information than this DVD.  The DVD also uses too much time showing you how to construct a grow room and less time on the important problems related to bugs, type of fertilizers, and disease that effect your crop. At one point in the DVD they try to create some humor, with these two real dumb dudes trying to grow.  Not funny at all! Just a waist of time. Don't waist your money on this DVD, buy the book if you really want to grow your own.",1404518400,,638,4.435897435897436

2485747,3,B000E3E266,"This is a good video,I would give it a 5 except for the 2 or 3 segments where those 3 idiots use hard core swearing .These dunces are retarded and could be used for an ANTI pot commercial.
The one guy can't even tie his shoes I would bet!!!!!
I also bought his book and that is a five also.",1396483200,,290,3.85
2485748,4,B000E3E266,"There is A lot of good information on how learning on how to growing is done and things you need so get the DVD
The price is right so have some fun and get it as said before you need to get good seeds but you never know some
You have may great seeds right know also you must learn to tell the difference between the female and male Plant's
you only want females. Well have a good time trying it takes time to learn.",1394236800,,415,3.8941176470588235

2485750,3,B000E3E266,"Hi , I was disappointed in the movie. I really did not learn much from this. If you have any experience this is not the dvd for you has many nice pictures and I'd professionally shot.  I was hoping there would be great detail on led lights growing indoors ext. I also purchased Jorges book (marijuana grow basics). This book is awesome great detail on growing in indoors , outdoors. It covers all topics. I have several DVDs and books and believe this to be the most in detail, Professionally written book on the subject of marijuana. Ed's book is also terrific and maybe even more detailed. If you don't have much cash and only buy one book buy jorges. The advantage I find over eds is Jorge doesn't use a lot of hundred dollar words that I guess at the meaning. LOL . good luck with your Endeavor's.",1384560000,2,801,4.375838926174497

If I were going to cultivate green, this would be the dvd to own. Don't waste money renting
you'll want to watch it more than once.  Like a Weed Grow 101 college course crammed onto a dvd.  :)
I'm a cannavist (activist for legalization) and I've been buying different MJ books and watching documentaries, and dvds to educate myself. If you want to know ANYTHING about growing chronic this is THEE one for you.  Of course the majority covers growing indoors in sneakily built rooms with high tech gadgetry. So if you are maybe, a medical mj patient looking to grow a few OUTSIDE this might not be for you. Anyways GREAT DVD JORGE CERVANTES!",1365120000,,724,4.511450381679389

2485763,2,B000E3E266,"This DVD is ok for beginners, but does not go into great detail about anything. Also, it seems somewhat unorganized and disjointed. It would be very simple to make a much more organized and detailed DVD, and such DVD's SHOULD be available. You can learn much more about growing marijuana for FREE by just watching many of the growers who offer information on YouTube. Their videos are much more up to date, and offer more detail than this video. It takes a little time to find them all, but they offer free advice and very up to date growing methods. There is quite the ""growing"" community on YouTube, and many of the more experienced growers offer great videos and advice, and all for free. They are much better than this High Times video. If you are a total novice, this video is ok as a start, but it is lacking in detail and organization. A REAL grower's guide would require two DVD's of two or more hours detailed instruction each.",1295568000,12,936,4.511764705882353

I would suggest a follow up video of some small set-ups of 1 to 4 plants. With a step by step set up and final smoke, from germination to rolling the blunt.

As well I think he sould make another video with current upgraded technologies like UFO LED LIGHTS.",1229385600,4,434,4.4125
