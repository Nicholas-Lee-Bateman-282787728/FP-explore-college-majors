8078530,4,6301572769,"This is more of a coming of age tale set in 50's Australia which takes a violent turn during the final 15 minutes. If you like Australian films, this would be a good choice. Nice picture quality in its original aspect ratio. Another great transfer job from Scorpion Releasing.",1391040000,,276,4.653061224489796
8078531,4,6301572769,"Not a bad movie, but not a horror movie either. I think Child of terror was added as packaging. Celia is more suited as a CBS childrens theater showing in the old days. The movie takes place in Ausralia in the fifties during a ferrel rabbit plague. Celia has nightmares, but they have nothing to do with the rabbits, the  communist neighbors her dead grandmother the creepy adults that spank her and her friends, or anything else as far as I can tell, but it's an entertaining movie.... just not a horror flick. I think Katerina,(Katerina's Nightmare Theater) is Australia's version of Elvira, Mistress of the dark.",1365724800,,615,4.747663551401869
8078532,3,6301572769,"Is there a trailer for this movie, I've never seen it!! I've checked both prime and instant, its just not there!!",1362355200,,113,4.428571428571429
8078533,4,6301572769,"I had never seen this film but know it was sort of pushed as a horror film, which it really isn't, although it has some horror overtones at times.  Celia is a little girl growing up in Australia in the late 50's & she doesn't do well with disappointment.  This is actually a great film, and kind of an odd choice for the ""Katrina's Nightmare Theater"" series, since it's more a sort of coming-of-age film, but it also deals with how cruel people can be to each other, and what that cruelty can lead to.  The DVD looks great and is well worth having, and the film is well done & quite well acted.  Definitely a winner and well worth seeing.  4 of 5 stars.",1361923200,5,653,4.192
8078534,5,6301572769,"Despite not being a horror film as advertised, this film is still an amazing piece of art. The acting is flawless and never fake, and considering the obscurity of this film from Australia (Its not British)which never had a DVD release, its truly amazing. The story is very gritty, brutal, and has many subplots unrelated to the main plot which keep up the feeling of the events taking place in a real world and not just made up for the screen. For example I loved the threat of the national communism party sub-theme. I recommend this for serious film watchers, not for casual mindless violence film watchers though.

8078535,4,6301572769,"I think the 'child of horror' is just a gimmick for video release - the copy I watched says 'child of terror', and I don't recall any such tag during the theatrical release. Hardly a horror movie, the story of Celia is very similar to Heavenly Creatures; children driven mad by the stupidity of the adults they are supposed to look up to. Excellent child acting all around. I give it a six (of seven).",1045699200,5,401,4.36
