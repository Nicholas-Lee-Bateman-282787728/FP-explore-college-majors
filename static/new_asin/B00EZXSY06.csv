5962013,1,B00EZXSY06,"They try to sell the movie by having names like Christopher Lloyd and David Spade in the 'cast'. This is a very low budget like movie. The audio is dubbed so the lips rarely match up with the voice, its worse than an old kung fu movie.",1380326400,4,235,4.0212765957446805
8611012,1,B00EZXSY06,The movie was dubbed in English.  The voices did not match up with the actor's lips.  It was annoying to watch.  Never got through watching the DVD because of it.,1493856000,,162,4.333333333333333

8611017,4,B00EZXSY06,"I purchased this movie because we had rented it from redbox once and my daughter absolutely loved it! It came quickly and as described. The 4 out of 5 stars is not the fault of the seller but the movie itself , you little ones will probably love the movie, mine did but the dubbing will drive parents crazy it is so poorly done. The movie was originally in Spanish and when dubbed to English (with Sam and Kat's voices!) it just didn't match up very well. It really is a cute storyline and cute movie though and still a favorite with my little girl.",1412035200,,549,4.238095238095238
8611018,1,B00EZXSY06,The voice over is horrible.  I don't think this is an original video,1406678400,,68,4.230769230769231
8611019,5,B00EZXSY06,"My granddaughter love this movie. I had rented it at the Redbox, so I had to purchase it for her birthday.",1395273600,3,106,4.095238095238095
8611020,5,B00EZXSY06,"First, it's the cutest story and actually incredibly well done. Yes the live action has some imperfect moments...DUH, anyone who thinks writing entirely new words that tell the story, in a different language, and then dubbing the English lines to match ppl who were speaking different words in SPANISH..and still have the viewers enjoy the story...anyone who thinks this can look perfect or is easy has some issues with logical thinking. The animated characters are ALWAYS dubbed perfectly and cute as can be. And the live action, when u consider what was involved in making this movie, is actually pretty impressive too. What a lovely movie really. It's a sweet, adorable, funny movie that actually , unlike most, has wonderful lessons for children too. And CHILDREN love it. That's what matters. And I'd let my kids watch it all day long.",1390089600,2,840,4.964539007092198
8611021,4,B00EZXSY06,"My kid is obsessed with this movie, so it's a full on winner in my book. With that said, it's pretty funny how bad the dubbing over the french actors looks. Who cares, like I said...kid loves it, she's almost 3 and this was one of her first full movies where she full engaged the whole time.",1383177600,5,291,4.12280701754386
