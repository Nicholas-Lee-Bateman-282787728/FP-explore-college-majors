4911636,4,B00600SPN8,Everyone is bashing this movie mainly because they don't like uwe boll. I only watched this because of Dolph. Not the best or worst movie i've watched but Dolph's punch lines made me laugh. If your a fan of Dolph its worth watching. It only had a budget of 7 million so what do people expect production wise. My only complaint is the camera work...a little to unsteady at times. Leave reality behind for 90 minutes and watch it for what it is.,1325116800,15,443,4.349397590361446
4911637,3,B00600SPN8,"Dolph plays Granger, a marshal arts instructor and ex-military man who is transported back in time to fulfill a prophecy about defeating evil. If the accent and bad acting of Lochlyn Munro as King/Raven doesn't make you laugh, stay tuned as the acting gets worse. The king's sorceress (Natalia Guslistaya) who transport Dolph dies, but her spirit sticks around a few scenes to help Dolph. Michaela Mann plays a bad actress who Dolph is too tired to have sex with.

After a little bit of wine, Dolph goes from telling the king to ""stick his prophecy..."" to ""let me at the B...."" He must kill the Holy Mother (Christina Jastrzembska) most likely due to her rejected Renaissance performance. Natassia Malthe (Bloodrayne: Deliverance)is the King's doctor who will accompany Dolph on his quest after he takes her virginity. She reminds me of a horrendous medieval Mila Kunis. Meanwhile the king will work on attempting to fully grow out his beard.

Dolph realizes things aren't the way he is being told and the water isn't purified. This sets us up for the twist...and a dragon.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some minor Pg-13 words and sexual innuendos. With the bad acting, simplistic plot, and language it would appear the movie was designed for a tween to early teen crowd, but due to the violence got an R rating, placing it in the worse of both worlds. For serious movie watchers, 1 to 2 stars. For young teens about 4 stars. Might do well during an MST marathon.",1324857600,2,1462,4.7254901960784315
4911638,4,B00600SPN8,"After reading a reviewer with ""Hated the first, and this one was worse!"" in the title and ""This one made the first one look great"" in said reviews body of text, I decided I would take a go at reviewing this peice with some theme of coherance.
Upon rating movies, many questions must be asked. Is it comparitive, and to what? The Transformers Trilogy looks like the godfather or LOTR trilogy in comparison to the Troll or evil bong trilogy. So do you look to quality of scripting, camera shots, pacing and acting etc? Or do you rate on pure entertainment value, IE how much you like it? My awnser is a mixture of all 3.

For starters, this is a movie shot on a $7.5 million dollar budget, independantly financed straight to DVD, and belonging to the fantasy action adventure genre. It contains a dragon. Similar in those terms is Eragon, a $100 million movie(that sucked). My expectations are low.

This film, directed by the infamous Uwe Boll, whos work ranges from solid, thought-provoking and intense or hilarious(Darfur, Rampage, Postal) to damnright incoherant disjointed messes (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne). Some of his movies are laugh-at bad (house of the dead). The Star, Dulph Lundgren, is also a cult-action actor of the same calabor, from ranging from rocky IV(4), to things like Master of the universe. This film is undoubtedly trying to bank on ""The Expendables Actor"" effect which brought him back into the spot light. Also present is other actors including ex-model Natassia Malthe.

So then onto the movie and the Plot: Granger (dulph), is a vet who teaches Karate in a contempory setting. Then one day, uninspired ninja's attack him in this house, and he is pulled back through time vortex to fufill an ancient prophecy. This is the premise which is overkilled a little, its GOOD V BAD. War torn world of Ehb needs saving by killing a evil overlord, which, being 50 years after the 1st movie, hasn't much relation but Granger is a decendant of the king bloodline.

Now, Dulphs acting in places was humourus. He looked out of place, not only with his modern clothing but his general attitude. This looked like a pay-check for him, where he appeared to have fun on the way. As with the first, some nice scenary's present along with Authentic costumes, but it is hampered by its budget somewhat. The Sleek Visuals does wonders in propelling the film and hiding its low-budget roots, and its in all technically competant if a little bland in its music and editing. At the end a hastily-esembled CGI Dragon appeared. It was slightly Anorexic, but totally AWESOME. LOL what is this movie? In the end all is resolved and goes back to normal. An Arc we see so often, but not like this where it turns into a conscious self-parady of hollywood conventions.

In fact, The commentary consists of amusing rants on the hollywood-film indistry by Uwe Boll along with some background on making the movie.

All in all, this is a good movie for its budget, totally applicable to drunken watching with mates or lighter viewing with children. Fantacy sword violence, with little in the way of sex or profanity. If you liked the first, your enjoy this one although admitadly is isn't as good or as much fun. It's good for what it is, but won't win awards. Mediocre.",1324339200,28,3264,4.717543859649123
4911639,2,B00600SPN8,"""Remember who your meant to be, remember that you must return to this place. It was my prophecy to die for you, it is your destiny to be here."" Granger (Lundgren) is an ex-special forces soldier who is now teaching karate to young children. While at home one night he is attacked by a strange being and is somehow transported to a different time. After being told of a prophecy it is up to him to save the strange world that he is now in. I have to admit that I tried to watch the first one a few times and could never make it through (even though I love Statham). This one made the first one look great. Without trying to be too harsh I couldn't tell if the acting was really bad or if it was the writing that made it that way. The fight scenes were this side of High School plays and the story was something that was thought of in a drunken night. All that said no one watches this type of movie for acting or plot anyway. Overall, I couldn't really finish either of these movies but if you liked the first one I think you will like this one too. I did not. I give it a C-.",1324166400,3,1075,4.004651162790697

4911651,2,B00600SPN8,"Saw this by accident. And decided it was so bad I had to buy it on DVD for my brother as a birthday present so he could share the pain!

Basically the original In the Name of the King had bizarrely managed to cobble together enough money to pay for decent effects and attract a heck of a cast: Jason Statham, Leelee Sobieski, Ray Liotta, Ron Perlman, John Rhys-Davies and Burt Reynolds for heavens sake. Sure the thing was hokey and didn't hang together too well in some ways but at least they spent their budget. Maybe more. Anyway as much as it was probably way over ambitious and unworthy of the cast it was at least aspirational. All of which makes this so much of a disappointment.

The cast is nowhere near the quality for starters. Dolph Lundgren is the only real name. And spends much of his time shuffling about the screen huffing like an asthmatic steam train. The rest of the cast seem rather a whos who of Eastern European people who look like you might have seen them in similarly poverty stricken movies (note - they aren't necessarily, I'm just using that as a descriptor). The acting is pretty horrific and its not helped by the direction. In the behind the scenes interviews there is some mention of the speed of the work. And it shows on the screen, things were just run through as quickly as possible presumably due to the utter absence of any budget. One example of this is where Lundgren is chatting to a female character who is trying to patch up some of his lumps and bumps and after she flounces out of the room the next scene cuts straight to her walking back in and offering her full services. The next scene  post servicing  sees her leave the room. Lundgren is in effectively the same position and in the same clothes in each scene. I mean.. the last bit is where theyve just, you know, and she is doing up her top button and walking out of the room. He still has his jumper and scarf on! Think about it guys, after spending some time with a lady do you put ALL your gear back on, including jumper and scarf? I mean fair enough I don't want to see em sprawled across the bed but the viewer is left with the distinct impression they just quickly ran through the scenes with nary a thought about such things.

 Somewhat of a shout out could be given to Lochlyn Munro who plays the king who does at least proved a modicum of acting ability. Yet outside of that the poor actors (and/or the poor acting) isn't helped by the script. It is a strange mixture with lots of stilted expressions and comes across as a person with English as a second language trying to write in a Shakespearean kind of way based on their viewing of other cheap fantasy adventure films. One other reviewer has already made note of the immortal chestnut It was an honour to fight by your side and lay with you as your woman and while that is perhaps the best effort there are others equally as out of place such as the early scene where some woman is running through woodland with a couple of hooded guys after her and she stops in a clearing before declaring Youve been bested! only to then engage them in a fight.

Outside of the clunky acting the props and sets are quite abysmally cheap looking. Honestly how on earth a somewhat box-office rehabilitated Lundgren ended up in such a cheap looking film is beyond me. Admittedly a couple of the visual effects aren't too bad. So that is a small plus.

I could go on and write an essay that itemises each and every negative point but this isn't a thesis, suffice to say that given the very low budget it was made on (one reviewer noting how the respective armies seem to comprise of a dozen or so), given the almost utterly no name actors and their attendant poor acting, the strange script and the lack of any audience engagement means this is a movie whose one chance of any sort of cult status would be derived from how bad it is. Must admit it has graced my flat screen several times as I sit slack jawed at how bad it is, just wave after wave of new delights of despair assaulting my vision. (and hence why it scores two stars and not one - at least you'll get your monies worth!).",1456358400,,4133,4.33764553686934

The majority of this film takes place during Medieval times, so the weaponry is primitive in nature but there are a few explosions. The plot is weak but there are a few twist and turns. Dolph has also had better fight sequences in other movies but the time travel and sorcery help make this bearable if you enjoy fantasy films. There is also a danger to both times, past and present and Dolph must save both eras. Two other major points, first this is clearly a ""B"" movie and secondly this has no connection to the first, ""In the Name of the King"" which starred Jason Statham.

4911693,4,B00600SPN8,"In the Name of the King 2/Two Worlds(released Dec./11),stars Dolph Lundgren as Grainger,Lochlyn Munro as the King(I recall this busy Canadian actor in Freddy vs Jason and as Drago Musevni in an ep of Andromeda),and many other good supporting players. Director Boll uses Vancouver and its environs for his shooting location(good old Vancouver has been a pretty big hot spot for movie making in recent times).
The plot involves Lundgren who is an ex forces man who runs a karate school for poor children. At home that evening he is attacked by men in black robes,and gets a shot off into one of them. He is rescued and taken back in time by a seer. She is killed and Lundgren is taken to the encampment of the King. The King tells him he is the Chosen One and wants him to slay the evil Holy Mother who apparently led the attack on him in the future.
Off Lundgren sets and along the way he and his party get attacked. At one point one of the hooded individuals has Lundgren at knife point but hesitates,and he gets away. Lundgren is interrogating another,trying to get intel,when one the Kings men stabs the man to death. Something is not right,and Lundgren suspects there is a spy in the group. Lundgren eventually is forced to go the trip solo and does so,walking right into the camp of the Holy Mother,unmolested. He walks into her tent and talks with her. It seems the story he knows,is false. It is the King who has usurped the throne from the previous one,and Lundgren is the ex Kings long lost son,who was put into the future by her,years before. The King now intends to go into the future and poison that world,as he is an accomplished alchemist. And it was her who personally went back to save Lundgren but got shot. She is slowly dying and tells Lundgren he must reclaim his title.
Lundgren leads a party to a dark forest,and in the forest is the Catalyst. The Holy Mother's daughter is there,but even she does not know what the Catalyst is. All anyone knows is that the chosen one must seek and retrieve it. Before he enters the forest,he bestows his crown onto her. In the forest Lundgren soon runs into the Catalyst;a giant Dragon. The Dragon flies about and  attacks the Kings fortress and lays waste to it. The King appears,opens a portal and goes back to the future,and Lundgren follows. A fight of course ensues in Lundgrens home,and eventually he is the victor. Lundgren settles back,knowing he has done all he can.
This is a nicely paced film and Lundgren does a fine job as the ex military man out of water,spouting modern colloquialisms to the Medieval crowd. The action is well paced and the CGI dragon is not too bad a creation. If you saw the first movie with Statham,this one has absolutely NOTHING to do with that one whatsoever. This one doesn't have that scope or budget,for that matter. Boll is the only director I think I ever heard complain about having too much money for a film budget,as he did on the first one. I guess he had to put the blame for the disappointing reception and BO take he had on the first somewhere;but on its' budget?.....c'mon. I think there were plenty if indie directors who would have wished that he had created a personal slush fund,to hand out to them. They would have killed to have just 1/60th the budget he did. Oh well.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,,commentary,the trailer and a writer interview.
All in all a good movie for the franchise. It is NOT a sequel per se from the first,plot wise,only in name. Lundgren does a good job in his role,as does the rest of the supporting cast. Recommended.",1348963200,,3638,4.537290715372907

4911699,1,B00600SPN8,"Two minutes and sixteen seconds. That is exactly how long it took me to realize that ""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" was going to be an epic suckfest.

Specifically, that was when a Xena-style sorceress eluded a pair of Robin Hood ninjas, and ran right into the street of a modern city. In his ongoing quest to make my brain melt, Uwe Boll has churned out yet another ghastly sequel to one of his horrid movies, dragging a perpetually befuddled-looking Dolph Lundgren back into Ye Olde Renfaire surroundings.

Grizzled veteran Granger (Dolph Lundgren) is pulled through a vortex by a mysterious sorceress, who then dies after proclaiming that he's part of some prophecy. He finds himself centuries in the past, where hooded assassins are trying to kill him. King Raven (Lochlyn Munro) tells him that he's the destined Chosen One of a prophecy who is the only one who can kill the Dark Mother (Christina Jastrzembska) and stop the Dark Ones, blah blah. It's all very generic.

So he's sent out on a mission with a bunch of soldiers and a sexy lady doctor named (I kid you not) Manhatten (Natassia Malthe). Does she have sisters named Brooklyn and Harlem? Anyway, Granger and the soldiers fight the Dark Ones on their way to where the Dark Mother is, but soon Granger discovers the truth about the Dark Mother and King Raven -- meaning he must now fulfill the prophecy in a different way.

""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" is a lazy, LAZY movie. Everything about it is halfhearted -- the acting, the plotting, the backstory, and even the fricking prophecy that the whole plot revolves around. Even worse, there's a MASSIVE plot twist that completely invalidates most of of the stuff that happens in the first half of the story, and leaves vast gaping plot holes behind it.

The entire movie has a grimy, dirty air, as if Boll rented a long-abandoned RenFaire ground for the setting, and both the Dark Ones and King Raven seem to have armies consisting of about two dozen guys. The scripting is absolutely abysmal, made even funnier by Natassia Malthe's hilariously stilted, breathless delivery (""It was an honor to fight beside you and lie with you as your woman!"").

And I honestly believe that Dolph Lundgren was drunk during the production of this movie. And I cannot blame him. He puts no visible effort into any kind of acting. And at the beginning of every scene, he has this slightly befuddled expression, as if he's thinking, ""Aw man, I'm still in this turkey? I need another drink.""

Sadly, Lundgren himself is the best thing about his character, who is 150% Gary Stu. He's a Special Forces supersoldier who is also the chosen one, has a secret past, and has a prophecy revolving around him; soldiers who initially hate him randomly become his biggest fans, and women who have exchanged two sentences with him want to have awkward sex with him.

Oh, and the ending? Copout. I assume that Boll's RenFaire lease expired, because he never really shows us what happens to the Dark Ones... and instead we get a lame, strangely abrupt one-on-one battle.

I thought fantasy couldn't get more hackneyed than the first movie, but ""In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds"" proves that you can always make a bad fantasy series cheaper, dirtier and more halfhearted.",1329868800,3,3274,4.689895470383275

The story: an ex-Special Forces soldier (Lundgren) is thrown back in time to fulfill a twisted prophecy that will save the devastated former kingdom.

I'll admit, I kind of liked the first ""Dungeon Siege"" movie: the visuals were creative, and the extensive cast was always entertaining. Both of these aspects are lost on the sequel, which goes to show what a budgetary difference of over $50 million can make. Most of the film has a bleak, contained wintertime look that's further offset by shaky handheld camerawork and only occasionally interrupted with naturally pretty forest imagery. The film's final 15 minutes feature a CGI-animated dragon fit for any SyFy production. Succinctly, it's all very boring to look at. Many folks criticized the former movie's ostentatious casting, but I think most would prefer that to the situation here, wherein the only casting qualifications must have been fitting the character's costume. Every single character is just so bland and the acting is roundly poor. Lochlyn Munro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Chicks/dp/B0002VYOVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Chicks</a>) is particularly awful as the king, and he's closely tailed by Natassia&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BloodRayne/dp/B000SAGGSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BloodRayne</a>&nbsp;Malthe as the eventual love interest. Replacing his fellow ""Expendable"" Jason Statham, Lundgren really doesn't seem into his role and it doesn't help that he spends the entire movie wearing jeans and a scarf; I was looking forward to seeing him in armor like on the Canadian DVD cover. The only performer giving a decent performance is Christina Jastrzembska (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Moon/dp/B003ZK99NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Moon</a>) as the ancient Holy Mother.

One of my qualms with the original film was the complete lack of suspense and obviousness of characters' intentions. ""Two Worlds"" builds favorably on this with a bit of slightly less predictable double-crossing and role reversals, but more than once the writing strays into convoluted territory when revealing plot points. This leaves us with only the action scenes to fall back on, but even here the film stumbles. Though the movie establishes Lundgren as a karate instructor, the martial arts in the movie are dull and poorly-shot. Weapons-fighting is the name of the game here, but that too is uninteresting at best and Dolph doesn't even touch a sword until the last stretch of film. The ""epic"" forest battle from the first movie is recreated on a micro scale (seriously, there are only sixteen people in this fight), replacing the Krug soldiers with hood-wearing humans (""dark ones"") but retaining the claustrophobic shooting style. The one-on-one finale is a gritty Steven Seagal-esque encounter, with no question whatsoever whether or not Dolph is going to win.

As far as the dialogue goes, Lundgren's character literally puts Natassia Malthe's to sleep by talking about cheese. That about sums up the rest of the show.

For a man who's openly distanced himself from big-budget movies, Uwe Boll really didn't utilize the freedom afforded to him by the direct-to-video genre here, choosing to do very little for his second sword & sorcery production. ""Two Worlds"" is a boring movie, and while many of the director's films have been severely flawed, they at least kept your attention with their slip-ups. This one doesn't really commit any blunders but I almost wish it would - at least I'd have more fun watching it.",1327276800,,4483,5.912037037037037

4911704,3,B00600SPN8,"After the hilariously and hideously bad first film, this second episode actually doesn't look so bad.  Okay, it's still not good, but it's campy, enjoyable fun anyway. Dolph Lundgren is pretty wooden and looking old too, but he's likable and has fun with his silly role. And Natassia Malthe is pretty darn fine. Oh,and there's a dragon! Campy, low-budget fun.",1325548800,3,359,4.983333333333333
4911705,2,B00600SPN8,"This movie is not that good and really wasn't even worth the Amazon rental fee. Some are giving it decent reviews because the movie was made with a small budget, but even with that the acting was crap. For Dolph this had to just be a paycheck and it was obvious as he was nearly sleepwalking through the entire movie. I find it amusing how he starts the movie instructing martial arts, but never really does anything related to martial arts in the fights the rest of the movie. Most of the rest of the acting by the supporting cast was stilted as if they were reading their lines off a paper while they were shooting the scenes. This was just a poor movie with a few interesting scenes that made it not totally suck. Lame acting, lame editing, and lame story equal a boring movie.",1325548800,,780,4.3493150684931505
4911706,1,B00600SPN8,"This rating is reserved for cheap, formula, straight to the DVD kiosk rental movies that would have a hard time finding three blind mice in a movie theatre to watch it.
(1.) Actors stuck in a rut playing the same typecast roles (look at their film biblios if in doubt) ad nauseam and audiences that need the comfortable predictability of stereotypes. Lundgren as ex-war hero now martial arts instructor as our cheap intro to start the movie. Acting was stilted, bland, read a line, cut and edit tedious.
(2.) The totally uncreative use of, and most of the budget spent on, costumes that look like every other similar movie ever made - lots of black hooded and caped wardrobes with the usual painted faces. Check out the King's wardrobe -  costume jewelry crown with big metal dangling things on his cape.
(3.) Dialogue, ""Aye, my Lord!"" and similar Middle Ages make-believe language probably first coined in a '30s Robin Hood movie and has persisted ever since in filmdom. Mixed with the usual stereotype fantasy phrasing, ""The dark one at the enchanted place."" ""Time beyond."" and ""We live in a time of powerful sorcery."" - ughhh. Finally add contemporary dialogue e.g. our middle ages sorceress/shifter kills three assassins and says ""You've been bested."",
(4.) Props, the usual 21st century cosmetics for the ladies and a really small fortress that looks like it was designed by the Gingerbread man. The usual highly bejeweled swords/daggers; usual candles (even 21st century large diameter candles) and torches lit even in daylight - must have a good discount supplier.
(5.) CGI of a blue whirlpool in air that is a time portal and, of course, a dragon with just a couple of flaps of it's wings somehow defies gravity and flies like a hawk. Comes equipped with the customary flame thrower. Overused, cheap special effects. Witch lives in a tree (or cave, depending on movie) of course.",1325548800,,1887,4.878504672897196
4911707,4,B00600SPN8,"Because of Dolph, this movie is will at least make basic video sales and have some decent viewership due to curiousity.
His lines are sarcastic and he seems to enjoy playing a very different role than his normal action movies (except for The Final Inquiry) which was almost completely a silent supporting part for Dolph.

It's nice to see an actor experiment and try to avoid the pitfalls of playing the exact same type of role just because it made money.
I believe that Dolph is a true inspiration and has a positive attitude.
As for the director, the film is enjoyable with minor flaws due to a limited budget.
Overall, it is a decent movie to watch-

This is a four star movie",1325548800,2,679,4.467741935483871
4911708,1,B00600SPN8,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever saw. As a matter of fact after about twenty minutes or soon I just got up and turned off the movie and went to do my laundry or to find some dirty dishes to wash. I told myself the next time I just stroll in family video to rent a movie I will DO SOME RESEARCH FIRST before I rent anything. This movie is horrible, unknown actors and poor everything. Don't bother renting it Don't buy it leave it on the shelf and hope that no one wastes any time renting it. There is nothing about it that either me or my husband found interesting ... a waste of time...I gave it one star but it didn't deserve that.",1325548800,,651,3.9770992366412212
4911709,4,B00600SPN8,"I'd agree with the other reviewers that said that Dolph really holds this film together. Probably more than anything else, Dolph Lundgren is the reason I bought this film before seeing it. Dolph's performance does not disappoint. He's always been a larger than life presence on screen, and this film is no exception. He's also smart enough to not take the material too seriously and, therefore, have a good time with it. His smart-aleck delivery of many of his lines is right on and often very funny, intentionally so.

The second reason I was curious about this film is because of the director, Uwe Boll. Uwe's career is much maligned, that's no secret. But, Uwe's films have a lot more going for them than people give them credit for. First of all, is Boll's uncanny ability to assemble some of most interesting casts that I've ever seen put together. He hasn't just done this once; he does it consistently. Secondly, Boll's films are always well photographed. They always look great, and there are often some surprisingly beautiful shots of natural scenery. Thirdly, his films often have very good musical scores. In the Name of the King 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the quality of material that Boll's composers deliver. Lastly, no matter the budget, Boll always seems to set out to make big movies. This enthusiasm is evident in all of the films of his I've seen.

That being said, In the Name of the King 2 is not a film that you can necessarily enjoy with a straight face. You have to be willing to understand that this is a film that is meant to be taken light-heartedly and simply enjoyed for laughs both intentional and unintentional. If you're in the kind of demographic that enjoys cheesy Direct to DVD action/adventure films than you'll probably love this. It's a wisecrackin' good time!

Also, honorable mention should be given to Lochlyn Monro. He's very entertaining as the king.",1325462400,23,1898,4.745454545454545
