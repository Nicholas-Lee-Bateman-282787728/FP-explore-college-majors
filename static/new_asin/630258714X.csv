7827754,5,630258714X,"As usual, ROH came up with another sensible production--the precise interpretation of the characters. In this sense, it is better than the Met's production with Kanawa and Domingo in it.",1492819200,,186,5.233333333333333
7827755,5,630258714X,"This is the ultimate production of ""Simon Boccanegra"" available on DVD. Agache is a stentorian-voiced Boccanegra, Te Kanawa sings and acts wiyh great lan, and maestro Solti leads the orchestra of the ROH with impecable verve.",1438646400,,225,5.277777777777778

7827757,4,630258714X,"I love Simon Boccanegra and to prove it, I have 9 Boccanegras on DVDs and 6 on CDs.
I'm surprised that the two existing reviews are so scant. Although by no means perfect, there is a lot to be enjoyed here. Kiri Te Kanawa is superb and Alexandru Agache also seems to have everything that a Simon Boccanegra needs: Presence, acting and voice - although the famous ""Figlia"" doesn't quite compare to that of Piero Cappuccilli (on the La Scala DVD with Claudio Abbado) and that of Tito Gobbi.
Also, there is no mention of the pretty great Alan Opie as Paolo. Rarely have I come across a better one.
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between Ms. Te Kanawa and Michael Sylvester. The latter also seems to think that rage is best demonstrated by chewing the scenery and throwing a bunch of papers around. He could definitely take a lesson from Veriano Luchettti of the above mentioned La Scala production: how deep rage and anguish can be expressed by a great singer actually without any props whatsoever.
And lastly, there is Roberto Scandiuzzi. Of course, he does sing in this production but without any real involvement in the proceedings. He even manages to cause one of the most moving scenes in all opera - the final encounter between Boccanegra and Fiesco - not to move me at all. It is rare that I don't have a big frog in my throat at that point but here, the frog must have died of cold and lack of nourishment.
Is it worthwhile getting this DVD. Absolutely. The production is wonderful, so are the costumes, and despite my reservations, it is pretty much at the head of the list of my various Simon Boccanegras.",1360454400,3,1635,4.5646258503401365
7827758,5,630258714X,"This is a splendid performance. Especialy, Ms. Ti Kanawa is a great soprano opera singer. I like her play very much.",1216684800,6,116,4.571428571428571
7827759,5,630258714X,"This lavish production from the ROHCG beautifully preserves the Amelia of Kiri Te Kanawa from her long best period.  As usual, she is stunning to look at but that shouldn't detract from one of the most beautiful voices of the recent years.  The entire cast is superb.  A memorable performance for repeated viewing.",1192579200,15,314,4.886792452830188
