7291095,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"My favorite Christmas film, although I sometimes watch it in July. Watching it last weekend made me realize how much I shall miss Alan Rickman & his lovely voice. Also wonderful are the performances of Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant & the ever luminous Keira Knightley. Although all the acting is of high quality. Honorable mention must go to Billy Bob Thornton in an all too brief role as a nasty US sitting President.",1454457600,,414,4.684931506849315

7291097,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"My son gave this to me for Christmas. Much as I love British movies and the actors in this film I was quite happy to know my December 24-25 repertoire would include It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas In Conneticut, Bells of St. Mary's and I didn't think I needed more to make the holiday better. As it turned out, this is on the holiday playlist now just because it is that good. As the title implies it is all about love which culminates in glorious ways for several couples. There is a lot of funny and cute stuff in this sometimes comedy of errors and there is sadness and a few touches of irony in the mix as well. It is crammed with a great ensemble cast that really delivers. While I am more than a little sad about Alan Rickman's recent death, he sort of went against type in this film and this is another great way to remember him. Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson all deliver superlative performances, Great film to watch year round, though it is a holiday treat too.",1454112000,,992,4.338709677419355
7291098,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,This film is a true classic - how we all search for love in our own ways. Very poignant situations at Christmas time that mostly make us feel very good about being the emotional human beings that we are. The acting is superb. Lot's of laughs and some tears. I've watched it several times and I will plan to watch it lots more around the holidays.,1453939200,,346,4.257575757575758

7291100,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"Love (actually) all the small stories that tie in with each other in unexpected ways. So many well-known actors/actresses doing such a terrific job ...each story so different from the other. I had not really considered this a Christmas film, since I had seen it many times in the past without there being a Christmas celebration...but this year it was our Christmas video! There is Christmas all through it, or should I say Love is all around us?",1453334400,2,446,4.730769230769231

7291102,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"cute sweet funny film. Love all the stories except the goofy British guy-that story was silly and lessoned the whole film. Emma Thompson makes me cry every time  see it. Great to see Andrew Lincoln before Walking Dead. Hugh Grant does what he does best. Love the old rocker,story line .",1453248000,,286,4.607843137254902
7291103,2,B00ZR3W3JQ,I saw this posted as a top Christmas movie. This has nothing to do with Christmas. I wouldnt recommend to watch with your family either with suggestive topics of pornography.,1515283200,,174,4.833333333333333

7291124,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"This is a wonderful movie. I originally knew nothing about it prior to watching so I wasn't expecting the number of surprise appearances in it. This is up there with, ""A Christmas Story"", and ""Miracle On 34th Street"".",1482969600,,217,4.7368421052631575
7291125,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"Love Actually is a rare gem indeed. Although regarded by many who haven't seen it as just another romantic comedy, Richard Curtis's deft storytelling and brilliance at showcasing all kinds of ""love"" make for not only an extraordinary rom-com, but a solid comedy regardless of sub-genre. The film follows multiple characters, played by a wonderful ensemble cast, whose lives are all intertwined on various levels, both deep and superficial. And each story shows a slightly different facet of love and relationships that ultimately combine to leave you a little bit heartbroken but also heartwarmed and hopeful.

If you purchased an earlier Blu-ray of this fantastic film (and one of my ""must watch"" Christmas-time movies), you may want to pick up this 2015 re-release which, thankfully, restores Kelly Clarkson's ""The Trouble With Love Is"" to its rightful place in the film (unlike the previous release which substituted another track).",1482105600,4,935,5.3175675675675675

7291132,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"While some may classify this as a ""chick flick"", primarily because it deals with the concept of love, I found it funny and truly entertaining. The family dynamic and possibility of disappointment is explored. I bought this because after watching it six times, decided to add it to my Christmas collection.

7291135,5,B00ZR3W3JQ,"I absolutely love this movie. I had wanted to see it for one particular actor but fell in love with it as soon as I watched it. I cried, laughed all of it. And the actors all are amazing. Though the person/actor I wanted to see wasn't in it much. Colin Firth and company are just great and the chemistry is so wonderful. Alan Rickman was amazing though now it's a bit hard to watch without him here, but he has always been one of my favorties. I am not a real ""chick flick"" type of girl but love this one. Got my Father to watch it who loves movies like the Notebook and such and he adores this movie. I would truly recommend it. Just look at the British actors and actresses in it it's amazing. My reference to my actor is Andrew Lincoln who played Mark. But still like I said the movie is great.",1458086400,,797,4.082802547770701
