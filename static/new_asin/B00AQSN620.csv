5471997,1,B00AQSN620,"Hold the camera still. Moving the camera and having it hide behind things peeping out from time to time add nothing to the movie.

You are just left guessing if it is the jerky movement of the camera ordered by the jerk of a director or the bad writing and acting that is making you want to vomit. Oh, and no movie need the music to run in the back ground 100% of the time. That went out of fashion in the 1930 B/W's.

5471999,4,B00AQSN620,"Would have been better as an anime, but for the sci fi channel, it's a good effort--someone there finally picked a good (despite the imposible physics) script, and made a good B movie, that has potential for a better remake.  Break out the popcorn, it's worth the watch.",1365465600,3,270,4.625
5472000,3,B00AQSN620,"If you've seen one SyFy Channel Original Movie, then you know what to expect from all of them. The simple formula consists of a couple of familiar television or genre actors, some type of otherworldly threat or attack, and some budget special effects that aren't quite as bad as what we get with The Asylum's movies. However, they still don't quite live up to the expectations set forth by years of watching films crafted with the help of ILM.

""Earth's Final Hours"" is no different except for a premise that isn't quite as hard to swallow as an alien attack or over-used as a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. Don't get me wrong; matter from an asteroid figures into the story. It's just not the size we're used to from years of movies like ""Meteor,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Deep Impact.""

The dense matter from a white hole in ""Earth's Final Hours"" is about the size of a soft ball and hits one side of the planet and exits through the other. This causes Earth's rotation to stop, leaving one side facing the sun to fry while the other freezes in darkness. One stripe down the middle of the planet will be inhabitable. Government officials want only the world's finest to gain a spot in this limited ""Green Zone."" A group of CIA agents and scientists are more concerned with saving everyone by finding a way to set the Earth's rotation back to normal.

I admit the concept behind ""Earth's Final Hours"" is way more intriguing than another film serving us more of the same collision course / end of the world fodder we're used to. Instead of pieces of flaming rock smashing into buildings and people, we get solar beams and flares that burn up everything in their paths.

The problem lies in the pacing of the movie. It gets tedious watching individuals run around shooting at each other in between momentary spatters of someone being incinerated. There has to be more writers can do with this concept than what they gave us here. Unfortunately, chances are there isn't on a SyFy Channel Original Movie budget.

Bruce Davison is the big-name celebrity for ""Earth's Final Hours."" He's starred in the ""X-Men"" movies as well as ""The Practice"" and ""Last Resort"" TV shows. Julia Benson is no stranger to SyFy Channel projects, having starred in ""SGU Stargate Universe"" and most recently ""Chupacabra vs. the Alamo."" Cameron Bright is recognizable by most as vampire Alec in the ""Twilight"" movies. Robert Knepper is on the CW's ""Cult"" and also had roles in ""SGU Stargate Universe"" and ""Heroes."" Roark Critchlow pops up on ""Pretty Little Liars"" occasionally and also starred in SyFy's ""The 12 Disasters of Christmas"" and ""V.""

The high-definition transfer of ""Earth's Final Hours"" does nothing to help its inadequate CGI effects appear any better. If anything, it highlights their limitations even more. As I said above, they're not as bad as they could be but still come up lacking. The 5.1 surround sound will help immerse the home audience into a dramatic world of explosions, gunfire, and other jarring sound effects.

""Earth's Final Hours"" provides an alternative to the usual end-of-the-world scenarios we're handed. That doesn't mean its quality is any better as far as filmmaking is concerned. It will mildly entertain and serve as a distraction from real life as SyFy Channel Original Movies are intended to.",1365379200,29,3319,4.822495606326889

Sure, it has your basic end-of-the world plot that you see in movies like this. Course, most of them hardly ever make any sense. Despite the fact that it, too doesn't make too much sense; it is a pretty good movie. Robert Knepper, Julia Benson, Cameron Bright, Bruce Davison,  Michael Kopsa, Roark Critchlow and Julia Maxwell all brought believable performances to their respectable roles. The cinematography and whatnot was great. Special effects and CGI were great enough that they would rival any seen in a multi-million dollar movie(which is saying alot considering this was, indeed, a SyFy movie that aired way back in 2011).

There wasn't anything of note that I had any gripe with. Honestly, I wish more SyFy movies were made like this. Heck, I wish more disaster movies were made like this. I really liked it and enjoyed it. Recommended? You bet.",1365206400,24,1128,4.926315789473684

Right now films the other guys are streaming are so bad that Blockbuster, Target, Walmart and the others toss junk like Earths Final Hours into a great big bin of ten for a dollar buy them now garbage cans, cause they certainly could not ever rent them.

Earths Final Hours falls into this big ten for a dollar junk Flick bin category, but unfortunately I paid $2.99 to watch this piece of trash.

The low budget production lets put the cameraman on roller-skates technique to simulate action in the action scenes was used way-too often and Amateuristiclly at best. The plot, Simple Simon, to easy to say, Saw that coming, thats just plain stupid, or why did he do that - that don't make no-sense no-how  no-way kept slapn me up-side the head.

5472064,3,B00AQSN620,"I don't think I will be spoiling the movie for you when I tell you up front the earth survives thanks to the determined efforts of a small group of people who won't take no for an answer. The problem they face is earth has been struck by a small but powerful projectile which penetrated and passed through the earth coming out on the other side and is causing the earth's rotation to slowly come to a stop. When that happens earth's magnetic shield will collapse and one side of the earth will be constantly exposed to the sun while the other side will be exposed only to the darkness of space.

The only available solution seems to involve the work of a man who, 15 years earlier, had been put in protective confinement (jail) supposedly for his own good and had been declared insane by government officials. The government determines that after the earth's rotation has stopped there will be a narrow band of habitable land surrounding the earth where darkness meets light. The government's plan is to use this man's work to make this band habitable and to limit access to those selected as worthy by the government.

Our small group of heroes bellieves the man's device can be used to start the earth's rotation again and save everybody. Most of the movie is about these two factions each seeking control of the man and his device, shooting at each other and trying to survive the increasing chaos produced by the gradual slowing of the earth's rotation.

Overall the movie moves at a good pace but does get bogged down at the end. I've seen it once now and will probably not want to watch it again although I'm glad I invested the time in watching it once.",1390608000,6,1660,4.526666666666666
