1385248,3,B000050GBD,"KISS: Unauthorized is a must-own for KISS fanatics.  Although there are few clips of KISS performing live, this DVD is loaded with cool footage of the band (the late lineup: Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Bruce Kulick, and Eric Singer, and the original lineup: Gene, Paul, Peter Criss, and Ace Freliley) at record signings, on TV shows being interviewed, at the conventions, and even setting up for a performance.  Some great moments are Ace Freliey's induction into the Rock and Roll walk of fame, and KISS appearing outside in full makeup and costume for a 'press conferrence.'  Definitely worth seeing, but probably not something you'd watch many, many times!",985132800,5,659,5.083333333333333

7928841,3,B000050GBD,"To judge by Amazon's title, you might think this is called ""Unauthorised"" - but if you look at the DVD and the cover, you'll find it's called ""You Wanted The Best, You Got The Best"". But when you actually PLAY the DVD, you'll find that this is ""Rock & Roll Legends - Kiss Forever Part 2"". So what do you get if you actually buy this? Interview pieces from the (first) makeup era, documentary pieces (ditto), snippets of performances, an interview with Peter Criss after leaving the band (and minus the makeup), and more. A number of these are available in other DVDs, but are either more truncated here, or on those other DVDs. In a lot of cases, the sound is better on this DVD as well, despite obviously being transferred from (old) videotape. In a lot of cases, some of this footage was excerpted in Kissology - but at a lower quality and frequently truncated. So you really need this DVD to complete your collection if you're hunting down documentaries and behind the scenes stuff about the band.",1190851200,,1000,4.561111111111111
7928842,4,B000050GBD,"This cd contains interviews with ex-KISS guitarist Vinnie Vincent, Bull Aucoin, Bob Kulick (Bruce Kulick's brother), and Gene & Paul.  Its a provides insight as to why Vinnies last two solo albums were never released and the decisions behind some band members induction into the band.  It also was put together and has better special effects than the last unauthorized DVD.",1058918400,5,373,5.098360655737705

7928845,3,B000050GBD,"Just a smattering of seemingly random clips. Having never seen Vinnie Vincent in any clips I found it interesting & entertaining for the short amount of time that this ran. If I was to complain, I'd want more for my money. I would want more bonus material, music, liner material. If I spend [$$] I just don't want a single 55 minute segment with nothing much more.",1056931200,3,364,4.447761194029851
