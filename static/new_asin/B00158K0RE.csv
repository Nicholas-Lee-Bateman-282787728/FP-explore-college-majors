3140853,5,B00158K0RE,"FINALLY the long awaited release of the 'lost' rat pack movie!! Yeah! As a life long Dean Martin fans who has about 20 bad dubs of this, i'm psyched to see it finally commercially released!!
  Not only is Dean totally CUTE in both dress and casual uniform, he has a great part in this one. I suppose it took so long because of the racial overtones, but racism WAS a part of our history, whether we like it or not and Dean is kinda the good guy here.
  And it's pretty well known that the Rat Pack was instrumental (pun - get it!) in helping blacks start gaining equality in Las Vegas...
  It's not a serious piece, or a western drama. It's silly, full of in jokes, a total guy movie. The history of the Ghost Dancer Indians is completely wrong and not even close to real history, but the Indians were often the bad guys back then (another racial problem with the movie - but hey - it's the 1960's and it's the Rat Pack...deal with it)...

  In short, the guys are great and seem to be having a blast, despite the fact that Lawford is still amongst them (tho not for long)...

  And, like i said, Dean is TOTALLY cute in it. So relax, have a beer, and enjoy it for what it is...

3140858,4,B00158K0RE,"Although described on the case as a comedic Western, this movieone of the only two (the other was the original Oceans 11)in which the entire Rat Pack appeared togetheris actually a fairly serious retelling of the 1939 feature Gunga Din, transplanted to the American West in 1873.  First Sergeant Mike Merry (Frank Sinatra), Sgt. Charles Chip Deal (Dean Martin), and college-educated Sgt. Larry Barrett (Peter Lawford) are the core of the noncom complement at their fort, though often the despair of their C.O., Col. Collingwood (Richard Simmons), and their uptight Sergeant-Major, Roger Boswell (Joey Bishop), for their brawling when off-duty.  One such brawl is touched off when they take the part of a young black man, Jonah Williams (Sammy Davis, Jr.), whos being baited by a group of buffalo hunters.  Jonah longs to be a soldier and manages to follow the trio back to the post, where the Colonel has a job for them: a fragmentary message has been received over the telegraph from the settlement of Medicine Bend, suggesting that the place is under attack.  Merry, Deal, and Barrett are to lead a detachment to investigate the situationwhich they do, unobtrusively joined by Jonah.

At the settlement, they find all the buildings standing, unlooted, but deserted except for a small group of Indians led by a young chief named Mountain Hawk (Henry Silva).  But there turn out to be a lot more nearby, and a rousing extended battle ensues, at the end of which the hostiles are in flight.  A friendly chief, Red Eagle (Richard Hale), identifies their artifacts as belonging to the Ghost Dance cult, led by Watanka (Michael Pate), a charismatic medicine man who has prophesied the return of the gameif the whites can be driven out.  Its now up to the sergeants, and Jonah, to find out where the Ghost Dancers are hiding out and what they plan to do next.  Meanwhile, Larrys enlistment is about to expire, and he intends to marry his sweetheart, Amelia Parent (Ruta Lee), and go back East to read lawsomething his two pals will go to great lengths to prevent.  But in the end its Jonah who saves the day.

Of course, the real Ghost Dance religion (which did in fact predict the vanishment of the white usurpers and the return of the game, but required only that adherents perform a certain dance to bring this end about) didn't arise until the late 1880s, when it was begun by a Paiute named Wovoka.  And I wonder what became of the people of Medicine Bend (their fate is never revealed), and question the idea of three noncoms leading a patrol, especially when it may encounter resistance.  But the Pack performs well and theres plenty of action.",1442793600,2,2646,4.789010989010989

Disc 2.35:1 Widescreen Enhanced.  Dolby Mono excellent quality video / audio track - well, what can you say... it was shot on a set.

This wasn't a comedy, it was an attempt at a serious ""Calvary and Indians"" with a couple chuckles, and a little bit of romance stuck in... it was truly a "" a LITTLE something for everyone"".

Low budget, saturday afternoon TV western script aside, this was one heck of a treat.

3140893,3,B00158K0RE,"Oceans Eleven was the first film to feature the infamous `Rat Pack', Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.  Sergeants 3 is the second and last, to feature these five.  The western starts out quite well, but later fizzles into rather mundane silliness.  Still, this is mostly a fun and entertaining time, with some Hollywood legends.

Sergeants Merry (Sinatra), Deal (Martin), and Barrett (Lawford), are assigned to lead a group of soldiers on a mission to find out what happened at the town of Medicine Bend, where it is suspected that Indians may have attacked.  Bishop is also a soldier, while Sammy Davis is Jonah Williams, an entertainer who tags along with the group.

Soon after their arrival in town, a furious battle with the Indians ensues.  The action highlight of director John Sturges's film is quite well-done, punctuated with plenty of explosions, and executed with much gusto and mirth.  The attackers, known as the `Ghost Dancers', are driven back into the hills.  What happened to the town's inhabitants is not made clear.

Against orders, Deal heads into the mountains to find the Ghost Dancers' lair.  Together with Williams, the pair discover the Indians' secret hideout, a cave high in the mountains.  Merry leads an improbable rescue mission, where a handful of soldiers hold off a vastly superior force.  Bodies keep flying off cliffs, and Williams saves the day by escaping to sound a decisive warning.  It all doesn't make much sense, but with no casualties among the Rat Packers, things end better than could be expected.

Mostly an action-adventure, with some comic moments, Sergeants 3 is more to be enjoyed for the distinguished cast, one big battle, and some quality cinematography.  It's worth seeing to catch the Rat Pack in action, and a good-natured Dino playing for laughs.",1240272000,,1846,5.0230263157894735

That the culprit was the great John Sturges, who directed classics like THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and THE GREAT ESCAPE, is really astonishing. ""Action"" scenes are laughably sped up and apparently no stunt coordinator was hired for the picture since nothing else would explain some of the worst movie punches ever thrown.

It's ashame it took all of them to die before being released to the public.

The one and only scene I remember was Sammy Davis, Jr. blowing the buggle and having the arrow stike him. Funny, I thought they were in a fort at the time. So, I guess parts of the movie stuck with me.

It's a typical western Indians vs. Cavalry but with the Gunga Din message, although I didn't get that part. Acting was good considering the era and plot was o.k. Still, it had it's funny moments and little sneekery, i.e. cutting cards with the blacksmith, ""dismissed"".

I thought it strange the Indians were more compasionate when it came to tossing anyone off the cliff. Did they just want Peter and Frank to witness the oncoming slaughter? Oh well.

My big problem with the film is that Sammy Davis Jr.'s Gunga Din is portrayed as a bufoon.

3140901,3,B00158K0RE,"Sergeants 3 are Frank Sinatra (Mike), Dean Martin (Chip) & Peter Lawford (Larry). It's basically Gunga Din goes west. Sammy Davis, Jr. (Jonah) has the part of Gunga Din. The movie actually has holes large enough to drive a Mack truck through so  a suspension of belief is necessary. Once that is done you can enjoy the movie. It's got some sections that are action-packed. I've been looking forward to this being released on DVD but never thought it would be. I actually saw this movie as a ten year old at the theatre; my memory of it was that it was funny & adventurous. I might have seen this movie shown once on TV but it's been well over 30 years since I last saw it.

Mike is the senior sergeant of the three, the brains & the schemer. Chip is the drinker, Dean Martin is really a ham in the role. Larry is the educated one who's enlistment is about expired & going to get married. A band of Indians have wiped out all the citizens a town & it's up to the three sergeants to garrison the town. It's never explained why this town must be held. The Indians appear to be an unknown tribe, turns out they're a fanatical religion, known as the Ghost Dancers, whose mission is to wipe out the white man so that the buffalo will return. Joey Bishop's role as the Sergeant Major is a minor role & he's a straight man.

This was the third Rat Pack movie & only the second one that had the entire bunch. It's the least well known of the four movies & it's not without reason. Fans can tell that the leads are good friends, it's very apparent. John Sturges was the director, he was responsible for numerous Hollywood classics, especially westerns, the most famous being The Magnificent Seven. Sinatra was the producer so he was in control of the project; he was notorious for doing scenes in no more than two takes, one if he could get away with it.

  Not only is Dean totally CUTE in both dress and casual uniform, he has a great part in this one. I suppose it took so long because of the racial overtones, but racism WAS a part of our history, whether we like it or not and Dean is kinda the good guy here.
  And it's pretty well known that the Rat Pack was instrumental (pun - get it!) in helping blacks start gaining equality in Las Vegas...
  It's not a serious piece, or a western drama. It's silly, full of in jokes, a total guy movie. The history of the Ghost Dancer Indians is completely wrong and not even close to real history, but the Indians were often the bad guys back then (another racial problem with the movie - but hey - it's the 1960's and it's the Rat Pack...deal with it)...

  In short, the guys are great and seem to be having a blast, despite the fact that Lawford is still amongst them (tho not for long)...

  And, like i said, Dean is TOTALLY cute in it. So relax, have a beer, and enjoy it for what it is...

First Sergeant Mike Merry (Frank Sinatra), Sgt. Charles Chip Deal (Dean Martin), and college-educated Sgt. Larry Barrett (Peter Lawford) are the core of the noncom complement at their fort, though often the despair of their C.O., Col. Collingwood (Richard Simmons), and their uptight Sergeant-Major, Roger Boswell (Joey Bishop), for their brawling when off-duty.  One such brawl is touched off when they take the part of a young black man, Jonah Williams (Sammy Davis, Jr.), whos being baited by a group of buffalo hunters.  Jonah longs to be a soldier and manages to follow the trio back to the post, where the Colonel has a job for them: a fragmentary message has been received over the telegraph from the settlement of Medicine Bend, suggesting that the place is under attack.  Merry, Deal, and Barrett are to lead a detachment to investigate the situationwhich they do, unobtrusively joined by Jonah.

At the settlement, they find all the buildings standing, unlooted, but deserted except for a small group of Indians led by a young chief named Mountain Hawk (Henry Silva).  But there turn out to be a lot more nearby, and a rousing extended battle ensues, at the end of which the hostiles are in flight.  A friendly chief, Red Eagle (Richard Hale), identifies their artifacts as belonging to the Ghost Dance cult, led by Watanka (Michael Pate), a charismatic medicine man who has prophesied the return of the gameif the whites can be driven out.  Its now up to the sergeants, and Jonah, to find out where the Ghost Dancers are hiding out and what they plan to do next.  Meanwhile, Larrys enlistment is about to expire, and he intends to marry his sweetheart, Amelia Parent (Ruta Lee), and go back East to read lawsomething his two pals will go to great lengths to prevent.  But in the end its Jonah who saves the day.

Of course, the real Ghost Dance religion (which did in fact predict the vanishment of the white usurpers and the return of the game, but required only that adherents perform a certain dance to bring this end about) didn't arise until the late 1880s, when it was begun by a Paiute named Wovoka.  And I wonder what became of the people of Medicine Bend (their fate is never revealed), and question the idea of three noncoms leading a patrol, especially when it may encounter resistance.  But the Pack performs well and theres plenty of action.",1442793600,2,2646,4.789010989010989

Sergeants 3 is the second and last, to feature these five.  The western starts out quite well, but later fizzles into rather mundane silliness.  Still, this is mostly a fun and entertaining time, with some Hollywood legends.

Sergeants Merry (Sinatra), Deal (Martin), and Barrett (Lawford), are assigned to lead a group of soldiers on a mission to find out what happened at the town of Medicine Bend, where it is suspected that Indians may have attacked.  Bishop is also a soldier, while Sammy Davis is Jonah Williams, an entertainer who tags along with the group.

Soon after their arrival in town, a furious battle with the Indians ensues.  The action highlight of director John Sturges's film is quite well-done, punctuated with plenty of explosions, and executed with much gusto and mirth.  The attackers, known as the `Ghost Dancers', are driven back into the hills.  What happened to the town's inhabitants is not made clear.

Against orders, Deal heads into the mountains to find the Ghost Dancers' lair.  Together with Williams, the pair discover the Indians' secret hideout, a cave high in the mountains.  Merry leads an improbable rescue mission, where a handful of soldiers hold off a vastly superior force.  Bodies keep flying off cliffs, and Williams saves the day by escaping to sound a decisive warning.  It all doesn't make much sense, but with no casualties among the Rat Packers, things end better than could be expected.

Mostly an action-adventure, with some comic moments, Sergeants 3 is more to be enjoyed for the distinguished cast, one big battle, and some quality cinematography.  It's worth seeing to catch the Rat Pack in action, and a good-natured Dino playing for laughs.",1240272000,,1846,5.0230263157894735

The movie actually has holes large enough to drive a Mack truck through so  a suspension of belief is necessary. Once that is done you can enjoy the movie. It's got some sections that are action-packed. I've been looking forward to this being released on DVD but never thought it would be. I actually saw this movie as a ten year old at the theatre; my memory of it was that it was funny & adventurous. I might have seen this movie shown once on TV but it's been well over 30 years since I last saw it.

Mike is the senior sergeant of the three, the brains & the schemer. Chip is the drinker, Dean Martin is really a ham in the role. Larry is the educated one who's enlistment is about expired & going to get married. A band of Indians have wiped out all the citizens a town & it's up to the three sergeants to garrison the town. It's never explained why this town must be held. The Indians appear to be an unknown tribe, turns out they're a fanatical religion, known as the Ghost Dancers, whose mission is to wipe out the white man so that the buffalo will return. Joey Bishop's role as the Sergeant Major is a minor role & he's a straight man.

This was the third Rat Pack movie & only the second one that had the entire bunch. It's the least well known of the four movies & it's not without reason. Fans can tell that the leads are good friends, it's very apparent. John Sturges was the director, he was responsible for numerous Hollywood classics, especially westerns, the most famous being The Magnificent Seven. Sinatra was the producer so he was in control of the project; he was notorious for doing scenes in no more than two takes, one if he could get away with it.

It was the one film of Dino's that I had never seen, so like many other fans, I looked forward to it!  The film has some really fine action scenes and some top notch scenery (Bryce Canyon National Park), and the transfer here is crisp and colorful.  Dean and Frank are clearly the stars here, and they do just fine.  The shortcoming of the film, from my perspective, is that it can't quite seem to figure out whether it is a serious drama or a comedy.  Nevertheless, I do recommend it.  It's not ""Rio Bravo"", but it is fun.",1210896000,5,607,4.234782608695652
8257739,5,B00158K0RE,One of the Rat Pack's best Western movie.......I liked where Frank Sinatra fell out of the back of the Buck Board wagon and he was drug under the wagon until he was able to crawl back in from t he side  and was able to help Dean and the rest fighting the indians.  He actually did this scene without a double.  Great location  for this movie.,1519776000,,342,4.136363636363637
8257740,2,B00158K0RE,"Review of Sergeants 3
Hot Toasty Rag, September 15, 2017

In full Rat Pack splendor, Sergeants 3 is a remake of Gunga Din, set in the Wild West. As of yet, I haven't seen the original, so my review will solely focus on this version.

Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Peter Lawford are the title characters, but the first two seem to tussle in barroom and brothel brawls more often than they successfully keep the peace. Pete is the straight-and-narrow one of the trio, and hes anxiously awaiting the end of his enlistment so he can marry his sweetheart and retire to a more peaceful life. Frankie and Dean don't want to lose their buddy, especially since his replacement is the stuffy Joey Bishop, so they try to entice him to reenlist. Meanwhile, Sammy Davis Jr. keeps tagging along with the regiment and trying to prove his worth as a soldier, even though the others don't really want him around.

The film is mostly a Cowboys vs. Indians movie, with all the familiar faces in cowboy hats and constantly getting into fistfights with various bad guys. Similar to the Frankie and Dean movie Four for Texas, the story feels like it was originally thought of as a comedy, but ended up as a light drama. Theres nothing really spectacular about this one, although its infinitely better than the Texas western, but if you're looking for a comedy or musical, keep looking. Usually, westerns are either tense or a spoof, and this is neither. If you absolutely love the Rat Pack, go ahead and rent it. But, for a Frankie western, I prefer Johnny Concho, and for a Frankie and Dean pair-up, I love Marriage on the Rocks.",1505433600,,1610,4.602787456445993

8257744,5,B00158K0RE,"I saw this in the theater when I was in the Army in Berlin.  The movie was just as good this time as the first.  But the big treat was Frank Sinatra Jr's commentary.  He had been with the production, knew many of the player's, meaning support players, and was filled with stories about people I have seen hundreds of times and did not know their names or what they had done.  For the commentary alone, I would say to buy or borrow this film.",1485993600,,441,4.152941176470589

But the movie, including the cast, bombs on just about every level.  It's not a comedy.  It's not a Western.  It's not anything.  If you paid for this, you were scalped.  The comedic ""Texas Across the River"" with Dean Martin is a better choice.",1484524800,,392,4.273972602739726
