3486995,5,B001B94JWE,"This movie is awsome. I first saw this film in 1983 when i was 15 on a TV show called ""Night Flight"" (anybody remember it?), fell head over heels in love w/ teenage Diane Lane & have never forgotten the impact this film made on me & watching it recently brought back many memories. I have been looking for this film for 20yrs & i finally found a copy! It basically tells a very cynical & realistic tale totally bashing the music industry. Young female nobody has ambition to be somebody, forms a band called The Stains with her cousins (one, a very young Laura Dern), goes on the unglamorous rough & lonely road with 2 other very chauvenistic rival male bands--a has-been-on-its-last-legs headliner & an up & coming punk band. Fee Waybill of the Tubes is great as the has-been & Paul Cook of The Sex Pistols has another great role as the lead singer of the punk band. BTW, the songs in this movie are very good & very catchy---you will find yourself singing ""We're the Professionals!"" for days! As the girls rise to the top they're punk hair, clothes & attitude become a symbol of young female power & all the rage with young girls everywhere. they're slogan ""We Dont Put Out"" becames the anthem of girl power that sweeps the nation. Theyre rise to the top is squashed by the backstabbing music industry & the conservative male dominated American media. The fluffy MTV styled video at the end is the icing on the cake! This movie is awsome because it takes on so many issues without ever losing the central story of this film or becoming cheesy or preachy. They really don't make movies like this anymore & I can say that this film is an unequivical classic with Diane Lane putting on the performance of her life. wow! what an actress. Even the so-called ""indie"" films of today try too hard to be ""shocking"" & just end up being predictible & exploitative, never coming close to the realistic telling-it-like-it-is nature of this film. The thing I don't understand is why this film is never shown & why its never mentioned. I hear there is a ""Making of Ladies & Gents The Fabulous Stains"" with all the actors talking about this film that i would LOVE to get. This movie was also a huge inspiration to Courtney Love ive also heard. Check this film out if you can find it!!!!",1091232000,71,2272,4.490338164251208
3486996,5,B001B94JWE,"In the Middle Ages of the early 1980s when Reaganostics was being poured down the nose of every living thing and conformity was required by law came this incredibly great movie, an innocent movie about music. Find a copy somehow. Watch it. Lend it to friends. The mood is not dissimilar in 2003 as it was when this movie was released, a rising tide of stupidity, evil and darkness.
Without sounding too corny, it's a brilliant little life-affirming movie that belongs on the same shelf as ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and it also makes a GREAT double feature with ""Repo Man,"" another gasp of fresh air from the wonderful (not) early 80s. Signs of life, very nearly underground films carrying the forbidden message that life is good, and that you can kick the Establishment in the balls and run to cover before they can rehabilitate you in the back with a hollow-point shell.
Very highly recommended. Without qualification. A GREAT movie and one that belongs in EVERYONE'S DVD collection, it really is that good, that original. A truly wonderful American movie that deserves far greater recognition than it's ever received.
From another point of view, every teenage girl in this country should watch this movie just to level the playing field following twelve years of Christian Wal-Mart BS being force-fed at every turn. ""WE DON'T PUT OUT!""

3487006,5,B001B94JWE,"This is one of a handful of films (""Over the Edge"" is another) that pretty literally changed my life as a teenager & shaped my life's path musically and otherwise ever after. First saw this film on its first run on The Movie Channel way back in the early '80s. Taped it back then and carried that VHS around for many years until the tape finally broke, and by then the film had gone out of print commercially. Was so glad to hear a few years ago it was being re-released, & glad to own a copy now. It really hasn't grown dated like a lot of movies of that era & the ""message"" of the movie is the same, and one of the best soundtracks ever. With all the legendary musicians involved, legendary actors involved (a very young Ray Winstone, Diane Lane & Laura Dern) and such a fine soundtrack and story, this one's a keeper. My significant other (another child of the '80s) watched it for the first time with me after I bought it and he loved it. If you're our age you'll likely love it, and I think there's probably a whole generation of pre-teens, teenagers and twentysomethings now that will dig it like I did.

Diane Lane's acting was horrible and it's hard to believe she's improved as much as she has. Laura Dern as a punk was hard to deal with as well. It's not a very believable movie and not all that interesting. I'm actually surprised I watched the whole thing, but I just kept hoping it would improve.",1385683200,,468,4.258426966292135

3487028,3,B001B94JWE,"Didn't know what to expect, never having heard of it until it Amazon suggested it. Couldn't believe that was Diana Lane. She certainly was a doll in the film, despite the wicked hair and make up. She definitely carried the film for me, because I didn't find the subject matter all that fascinating. There were too many scenes that were implausible, and I had a hard time understanding the English band members speaking much of the time. I liked the cinematography and watching a chapter of the early 1980s punk music scene. The film feels very dated, unlike, say Sid and Nancy, which is still very gritty and still very interesting, which is why I probably will never see this film again. Nothing terrible, but nothing noteworthy.",1379635200,,730,4.755905511811024

3487030,5,B001B94JWE,"One of the great cult classic films made. It comes with everything, and such a great cast , most making their debuts. Diane Lane was only 15 years old and Laura Dern only 12 ! There isn't a girl around who at one time or another didn't want to be Corrine. It has the hard edge of the punk movement along with the ups and downs, but most of all the fickleness of a public always looking for the next big thing and ready to bring down what it once loved. I thought I'd never get to see this movie and I am so glad Amazon Prime was able to bring it to me. You guys got it all !",1377216000,,574,3.7916666666666665

The film presents a great view of the competition between touring bands and the elusive struggle to stay hip. I see the beginnings of reality TV, and, as has been pointed out elsewhere, this may have inspired the ""White Strips"".",1372982400,,353,4.80327868852459
3487032,1,B001B94JWE,"The people who made this movie hadnt any more of a clue about punk rock than Jack Webbs 60s cop show Dragnet had about LSD or hippies. This is laughably clueless attempt by squares to appear cool to the kids and it is a failure on every level except unintentional comedy.
Some people have made the claim this movie was about female empowerment. Female empowerment my swollen red backside, unless by empowerment you mean looking and sounding as ridiculous as humanly possible.
Some people claim this movie is a satire, but in order to satirize something you have to know something about it. The movie merely pointed out the obvious: pop stars have a limited shelf life... no duh. Paul Simonon, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Fee Waybill must have really needed the money. I cant imagine why they would otherwise appear in this crass exploitation flick that makes Sid And Nancy look like friggin Shakespeare.

3487034,5,B001B94JWE,"This is a great ""coming of age"" movie. If you were a teen in the 70s and early 80s, you will appreciate the reference to changing times in music when that generation walked the high wire with punk rock. Not as raw as some out there.

What is interesting is seeing Steve Jones, Paul Cook (Sex Pistols) and Paul Simonon (The Clash) in their roles as a competing punk band. They're playing comic book versions of themselves, essentially, and doing a decent job at it.",1361836800,,450,4.769230769230769
3487039,3,B001B94JWE,Diane Lane is one of my favorite actresses.  I think she was only about sixteen when she made this.  She's been working at her craft a long time.,1357689600,,145,4.142857142857143
3487040,4,B001B94JWE,"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains: This offbeat cult, not quite a classic, was directed by Lou Adler and stars a young Diane Lane as Corinne, a cynical teenage girl, who, with no mention of a father and a recently deceased mother decides to form a punk rock band. She, along with her sister Tracy, (Marin Kanter) and young cousin, (Laura Dern) join together and take to the road with two other bands, a Jamaican agent and a dilapitated bus for bigger and better things.

The film seemed like a promotional campaign for the up and coming young Lane who had great critical acclaim for her 1979 film ""A Little Romance"". This film did not help her career but a year later she was back on top with two new film hits, The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. I recommend this film for those of us who would find this film nostalgic.  A reminder of what it was like to be a teenager or young adult in the late 70's, early 80's when punk rock REALLY rocked and hundreds of  small, often unknown bands, had their 15 minutes of fame.

The best part of this film were the eclectic group of co-stars that joined THE STAINS on their journey to stardom. There was Paul Cook and Steve Jones of THE SEX PISTOLS, CLASH bassist Paul Siminon and TUBES singer Fee Waybill. Best of all for U.K. film buffs there was a very young Ray Winstone who played Ladd's unlikely love interest. I would recommend renting or buying this film  and watching it while listening to the commentary of Diane Lane and Laura Dern playing. It is very informative and extremely funny. It was great hearing them make fun of themselves, they being only 15 and 13 respectively at the time of the filming, as well as the other actors and the crazy way the film got made. There is a documentary made in 2004 about the making of this film which I would love to see. As Diane Lane mentions, by the time the film was released, hard core punk rock was on its way out being replaced by mainstream artists like THE GO-GOS, THE CARS, THE POLICE, THE B-52s, to name a few.",1356393600,,2014,4.388739946380697

Diane Lane sucks as an actress. Steve Jones, Paul Simonon and Paul Cook didn't have nearly enough to do.....the subplots are half assed....and the whole affair feels calculated to cash in on a fading Punk fad....",1356048000,,381,4.96875
3487042,3,B001B94JWE,"I'd heard about this film but like it's been noted it got lost in the shuffle and also never was released on VHS .It's an okay to good film hurt by a amateur feel to it and some weak writing .The premise is simple enough angry,disillusioned teenager Corinne ""3rd Degree"" Burns has become a cause celeb on the local tv circuit. Her mother just died leaving Corrine and her sister living with an Aunt who could care less about them. They live in a small nowhere town where nobody looks to have a bright future. This is not uncommon in films dealing with teenagers I could rattle off a list off the top of my head. Corrine wants to be somebody( don't we all?) and has started a band called The Stains( there were several real band with that name BTW) with her sister and cousin. Oh I forgot to mention Corrine is played by a young 14/15 year old Diane Lane and her sister is played by Marin Kanter and her cousin by Laura Dern. In an  only in a movie way the girls attend a local gig headlined by the washed up rock band Metal Corpses led by Tubes singer Fee Waybill. The opening act is the Looters featuring Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols and Paul Simonon of the Clash. The singer is Ray Winstone channeling Johnny Rotten much like Shane West did Darby Crash in the film What we Do Is Secret. One of the Metal corpses actually becomes a corpse(OD) and they are off the tour. Tour Manager Lawn Boy needing another act quick selects the unproven Stains much to the chagrin of Ray and the other Looters. Since this is a movie not reality the Stains with no drummer and only 3 practices under their belts become a hit. Corrine coins the catch phrase ""We Don't Put Out"" which other young girls and a local tv personality take a liking to. Lawn Boy is kind of a Rasta Morgan Freeman i.e the stereotypical wise black man surrounded by crazy white people. Lawn Boy and to an extent Ray predict that the Stains will become big but that they are just a gimmick that will soon be forgotten. Ray tries mentoring young Corrine after initially hating the idea of having the Stains tour with them. They have a quick fling which is controversial in that Lane was well under 18 and Winstone was not and the idea of a older man having sex in the shower with a jail bait girl is kind of edgy or creepy. To further her career Corrine stabs Ray in the back stealing the Looters best song and changing it to a Stains song. In a footnote here the song The Professionals was written by Steve Jones and he and Paul Cook were in a band of the same name together after the Sex Pistols decline. Anyhow like predicted the Stains burn out quick and Corrine is left on the outs getting booted from her own band. The Stains go on without her. I assume the Looters lasted awhile as well and Corrine is left to fend for herself at the end. I guess this film isn't a million miles away from Times Square another film of the era (early 80's) about a punk rock girl who's in a band and wants to be somebody. That film while flawed and lacking punk cred is a much better film as far as acting,music and directing goes. Still as an essay on the folly of teenage rebellion and angst.the ability to become a star on a gimmick as opposed to having talent,over staying your welcome and the can do/do it yourself mindset of the punk rock movement The Fabulous Stains scores there. If you like punk rock and want to see a young star in the making (and Winstone is good too) then Ladies & Gentlemen I present to you The Stains.",1345680000,,3493,4.268476621417798
3487043,3,B001B94JWE,"I hadn't seen this film on it's original release, and I am glad I checked it out, but for my dollar, it really isn't all that good.

Here's the scoop. Diane Lane and her sister are orphaned. They live with their aunt (Christine Lahti) in a grimy, industrial town in Pennsylvania. She's interviewed, as a local disenfranchised youth, on the local TV show and becomes a bit of a celebrity. She then hits the road, with her sister and cousin, as the third act in a third rate rock tour and takes her message to the people. She becomes an overnight sensation but her and her message begin to unravel.

There are any number of rock related movies out there and this one (maybe because of it being an earlier one) didn't get it right. It didn't feel right or real, and it felt very disjointed. Much of the problem was in the writing but a lot of blame has to be put on the directing. Lane's character was weak. She's inarticulate and doesn't seem to have a strong hold on what she's trying to say. She continually insults the lead singer (Ray Winstone) of the other band, then has sex with him in the shower. I didn't get that at all. Her fan following grows way too quickly as well. One day she's barely anyone then the next she has a legion of fans show up at her concert dressed like her and their hair done up like hers. Then, because of a few unkind words spoken by Winstone about the Stains when he opens up for them, her fans drop her like a bad habit. This was all so unbelievable.

In the right hands this could have been a great, great movie. They just botched it.",1338336000,2,1568,4.25503355704698

If your an early 80s video arcade fan there is a short classic scene in this one just for you. That scene should have been much longer but I guess it's not a video game movie.

I wondered what 15-year-old Diane Lane's mother was thinking when she allowed her daughter to do one of the scenes she did in this movie? Then I read all about Diane Lane's mother and Diane. I figured that this movie probably represented one of the more normal times in young Diane's life!",1279929600,,697,4.117647058823529

3487049,3,B001B94JWE,"I mainly picked this up because I wanted ""Breaking Glass"" and ""Times Square"" but the prices on them were outrageous.  In an 80s nostalgia mood, obviously.

This movie has plenty of ""punk"" nihilistic attitude - or rather, some of the characters do - but very little of the frenetic energy and explosive sense of liberation that punk and new wave also embraced.  The pacing just trudges along in three feet of mud pretty much the whole time.

Ray Winstone is fantastic as usual.  Diane Lane is very good in the lead role, particularly considering how young she is.  Fee Waybill is entertaining as a has-been rocker.  But for me the thrills were in seeing Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Paul Simonon playing together. The Looters' performance pretty much steals the show, but that was all of about 3 minutes of screen time.

Admittedly they do try to take the rock film form a bit beyond the usual cliches, but along the way they lose a lot of steam that could've kept it engaging.  You feel the dreary boredom of being stuck on a tourbus yourself, instead of the thrill of being part of a rising band in a vibrant scene.  In other words, the filmmakers took early 80s subject matter and made an early 70s-type film about it, dwelling all too heavily on the unhappy internal lives of the characters and their various disappointments.

Two years after principal filming was completed they shot the last few minutes of the film, and the jarring change of tone does not work at all, at least not for me.

Disc-wise I haven't checked out the commentary tracks etc. but I do wish the disc had subtitles.  I'd enjoy this film on mute, with subtitles on, while I played a bunch of records, just for the time period visuals, but I don't think I'll be watching it again otherwise.",1276992000,,1764,4.561904761904762
3487050,2,B001B94JWE,"It's not easy to classify this film. It's part rock 'n' roll/media satire, part After School Special on post-feminism, occasionally silly, occasionally overly earnest. Some decent music, along with some very bad music, a VERY young Diane Lane, Laura Dern and Ray Winstone make the film interesting as a curio, but I doubt this 'band' will rock many people's worlds.",1260835200,,365,5.1
3487051,4,B001B94JWE,"While not without its flaws, this flick features unforgettable dialogue and characters all backed by a rockin' soundtrack that really draws you into the world of the Stains.

I didn't know what to expect when I watched this film for the first time this weekend, but after watching it 3 times in a row I can almost recite it verbatim-it's that memorable.

Although the editing and flow of the story is kind of jumpy, you still can't help but be as captivated by the performances of The Stains and The Looters as their audiences are in the film. Truly captured is the raunch and struggles of the rock world (as we would imagine them) while keeping in touch with the inner struggles of the characters. Also, the supporting characters are played to great effect while never outshining the lead players.

The film isn't a parody like Spinal Tap, but neither is it as serious as something like Walk The Line. Humor is present in the film, being derived more from characterization than one-liners, but mostly the film is a study of rebelliousness fueled by hopelessness and desperation. Overall a very unique film that could only have been made when and how it was as a captured moment in time.

Of the two commentary tracks the one featuring Laura Dern and Diane Lane is by far the most informative and enjoyable. The enthusiasm the women share for the the film 20 years on is infectious and makes you realize that as 13 and 15 year olds these women almost believed they were rock stars, sometimes talking as if they really were on tour at the time.

If you're looking for a one of a kind rock and roll adventure ride, the Fabulous Stains is where it's at.  Check it out!",1248134400,,1665,4.551839464882943
3487052,5,B001B94JWE,"I loved this as a teenager, and the girl power theme holds true today. The film played an important role in my formative years. Music by members of the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and The Tubes is a bonus.

3487054,3,B001B94JWE,"If not for the casting, this film never would have been re-issued.  I didn't see it back in the 80's, but probably would have loved it.  I was a big Jones & Cook fan, and still own the 7 inch single of ""Join the Professionals"", as well as the debut album from The Professionals.  I also had a major teenage crush on Diane Lane.  Add in Clash bassist Paul Simonon, Ray Winstone, Laura Dern, plus Fee Waybill and Vince Welnick from The Tubes and this is a film that any fan of Punk or New Wave Rock should see.

The music is very good, although three different versions of ""Join the Professionals"" are a bit much.  With all that musical talent on board, I would have liked to have heard a few more original numbers, with the music playing a bigger role in the film.  Another reason to focus more on the music is that the direction, writing, and pacing are all over the place.  At times the film grinds to a halt with stilted dialogue or pedantic monologue where at other times it leaps ahead and clean off my belief suspension bridge.  I mean how the heck did The Stains go from nowhere to everywhere in a few months?  They didn't even have a drummer and only seemed to have one song before they co-opted ""Join the Professionals"".  Suddenly they become the idols of millions of teenage girls, yet still appear to have just one or two songs in their repertoire.

Over all, the good outweigh the bad.  It's a huge kick to see Jones, Cook, & Simonon rock out with Winstone as The Looters, and they do get a few rousing stage numbers in.  Another captivating moment for me is when The Stains play ""Waste of Time"" in what apparently is their debut show.  As confirmed in the Lane and Dern commentary, director Lou Adler made sure that they did not practice the song ahead of time so that it would be suitably raw.  Boy is it ever.  It's also fairly appealing in its rawness, foreshadowing a lo-fi Slits-influenced punk sound that is probably more popular with the Indie Rock scene now than it ever was.

As a sort of Punk Rock time capsule, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains"" is recommended viewing, but it isn't something you will likely watch in its entirety more than once or twice, and for a more enjoyable viewing experience, I also recommend using fast-forward where applicable.",1245801600,,2286,4.467469879518072
3487055,5,B001B94JWE,"This one's not an ""in-betweener""...you're going to love it or hate it.

Featuring The Sex Pistols' Paul Cook and Steve Jones and the Clash's Paul Simonon as members of ""The Looters"" and The Tubes' Fee Waybill as ""Lou Corpse,"" vocalist of ""The Metal Corpses,"" the real star of the show is Diane Lane as Corinne Burns, the Cherie Currie-Joan Jett-Lita Ford heroine-slash-protagonist of the film.

This was never a major studio, big budget undertaking. Yes, it was directed by the big-named Lou Adler, but let's face it...he was slumming, ""having a larf.""

Part of the charm lies in the fact that the acting approaches ""groaner"" level in spots, and the novelty of rock & punk legends in the cast only ups the ""Saturday late night, nothing to watch, hey...let's check this one out"" factor.

In the film's final ""Fabulous Stains"" fake MTV-style rock video (""Professionals"" by Cook & Jones, which Amazon currently excerpts at the end of their featured clip for this DVD), Diane Lane is gorgeous...she really nails the attitude, whether she's an actress playing a rock star or not. According to IMDB, ""The final sequence of the film (the aforementioned ""Professionals"" video) was shot and added on after initial reaction to the film was unsatisfactory."" That may be true...it is a major payoff to a movie that is campy and wince-inducing in some spots, and you may or may not be drawn to Diane Lane and Laura Dern's fictionalized re-enactment of the rise and fall and ultimate redemption of the Runaways...but if you're a ""B"" movie fan, check this one out.",1238803200,,1549,4.8783269961977185
3487056,2,B001B94JWE,"I'll give you that there's a certain mystique that hovers around this movie. Maybe it's the punk-cred presence of Paul Simenon, Paul Cook and Steve Jones. Maybe it's because so many teen punks-to-be saw it on TV in the 80s. Or maybe it's just that, in being unavailable for so long, people have romanticized it a bit. Let's call it a combination of all of the above.

Now, surely there's nothing wrong with having a certain affection for a movie based on things like this. But let's be fair: however fond you may be of this flick, it really isn't very good. It's a good idea for a movie, maybe, but poor writing and clumsy direction make it more curiosity than lost classic.

Think of Diane Lane's character, Corinne Burns. Sure, she says what's on her mind. She's a feisty little malcontent! But teen angst alone is, beyond any doubt, the most overused commodity in all of pop culture. Written with no trace of wit or insight, the character of Corinne becomes nothing more than a whiny little girl. The movie wants you to believe that she's actually saying the things that other teenagers only FEEL like saying. Trouble is, she does such a monumentally crappy job of it. Her tirades are never the least bit clever, convincing or amusing. So, when a local news anchor sings the praises of Corinne's rage and sends the young punkette onto (ridiculously instant) stardom, we're asked to believe something we just can't. The movie wants us to think Corinne is smart and special. But from everything we see of her, she's just not. Put it this way. Go back and find the WORST-written, most inane, poorly conceived rant you ever wrote in a journal when you were about 14 years old. I can promise you - absolutely promise you - that it's going to be better than any of the angsty drivel spewed out by Corinne.

But bad writing and direction don't end with our heroine. Everything in the movie is set up and resolved so simplistically that there's barely a believable moment in the whole damn thing. The hardly-even-a-band-yet Stains are - inexplicably - invited to be the opening act on a tour. The tour itself is a ridiculous pairing of an aging arena rock band and some young English punks called The Looters. (This is done, it seems, merely so the singer in The Looters can have someone to rail against.) The aging band falls apart. The Stains become famous and upstage The Looters. The bands go from playing dingy clubs to playing large arenas. This all happens in about a week. In the hands of a better filmmaker, it could have made some kind of sense. In this case, it has all the sense and subtlety of a really bad After-School Special.

Despite all this, there are a few bright spots in `Stains.' There's the teenage Diane Lane, who does offer up a spunky charisma as the pretty-but-tormented Corinne. There's also faux punk supergroup, The Looters, who play some pretty convincing punk rock. (This does lead to another unconvincing turn of the plot, though - you will NOT believe that the tepid Stains could ever blow The Looters off the stage.) And best of all, there's Ray Winstone. The only true actor/non-musician in The Looters, he's just as convincing as a rock star as are Simenon, Cook and Jones. He's also the only character you can care much about. Both Winstone and his character are worthy of a better movie than this.",1236643200,4,3332,4.6233108108108105
3487059,3,B001B94JWE,"""Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains"" ;  finally on DVD!

Not all ""lost"" films are gems, and not all legends (or hype) can be lived up to. The fact of the matter is, ""Stains"" was a total failure when originally released, and the reasons why are quite obvious. Please understand that we're not talking about a ""misunderstood masterpiece"" here....

Without a doubt, this film is perfectly cast. However, a poorly constructed script stifles performances. Diane Lane has such little material to work with that her character seems lifeless, and as a result, quickly becomes uninteresting. Character development can be described in these simple steps; Vacant stares, meaningless dialogue (delivered as though it's actually supposed to be meaningful), lots and lots of group bickering, and the occasional outburst of gibberish. It's easy to see why screenwriter Nancy Dowd chose to use the name Rob Morton on this project.

Script problems aside, it's a beautifully shot film, and the DVD transfer is absolutely stunning! It's also quite interesting to see Paul Cook and Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols), who were actually working with Joan Jett around this time. Also very nice to see Paul Simonon of the Clash!

If all you're looking for is a great looking 80's film, a gander at a very young Diane Lane, and a look at some real punk rockers in acting roles, then you won't be disappointed.

For those who may believe that this film predicted the future success of girl groups in the 80's, or the later so called riot grrrl scene, I would beg to differ. At the time of its theatrical release, ""Stains"" was already behind the times as far as musical climate was concerned. 70's punk had given way to 80's new wave and punk-pop. The cynical punk attitude exhibited by the Stains was old news by the early 80's, which is simply one more reason the film didn't connect with an audience. The newly shot ""MTV ending"" was an effort to sell a depressing punk rock movie to a new wave world. It didn't work.

The ending of this film (MTV style video) was added AFTER the Go-Go's made history with a number one album, and after MTV had already become a major force in the music industry. In fact, you can probably credit the success of the Go-Go's for ultimately causing the long delayed theatrical release (and the creation of the new ending). Inspiration for this film could have come from various sources, including such groups as the Slits (1976), Runaways (1975), and perhaps the early Go-Go's (1978). Of course, there were many other lesser known all-girl start-ups back in those days.

Certainly a movie worth checking out. Just don't get your hopes up by listening to all the hype and folklore.

P.S.

A poster for Rachel Sweet's ""Protect the Innocent"" LP can be seen in the film. An album that's also worth checking out!",1234310400,5,2823,4.776180698151951
3487060,3,B001B94JWE,"This flick is enigmatic to me.  It nobly tries to translate the punk ethos to the screen but it ends up a hodgepodge.  It starts out promising.  Ray Winstone is terrific as a punk singer forced to open for third rate glam-metal bands in backwater clubs.  The best parts of the film are the confrontations between Winstone and the poser played by Fee Waybill of the Tubes.  The film gets a certain degree of cred with the presence of Paul Simonon of the Clash and Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Pistols.  It's the central character of Corrine ""Third Degree"" Burns played by a teenage Diane Lane that gave me pause.  Today, Lane is probably one of our most accomplished actresses second in my mind only to Meryl Streep.  The young Lane, however, seems to think punk attitude encapsulates poutiness and a perpetual sneer.  The skimpy outfits and skunk hairdo they give her don't do the trick either.  Another major turn-off is a gratuitous shower scene between Winstone and Lane.  Sure punk rose from the ashes of discontent but there was always a sense of wry humor about the madness that surrounded us.  Refer to the Ramones as Exhibit A.",1232496000,3,1139,4.611940298507463

As a narrative, this effort from legendary record mogul turned (sort of) movie director Lou Adler would have benefited immensely from less script doctoring (screenwriter Nancy Dowd had her name removed from the project) but for punk/new wave nostalgia junkies, it's still a marvelous time capsule. Diane Lane plays a nihilistic mall rat who decides to break out of the `burbs by forming an all-female punk band called The Stains. Armed with a mission statement (""We don't put out!"") and a stage look that appears to have been co-opted from Divine in Pink Flamingos, this proto riot-grrl outfit sets out to conquer the world (and learn to play their instruments along the way). Music biz/star maker machinery clichs abound, but it's still a guilty pleasure, particularly due to the real-life rock luminaries in the cast. Fee Waybill (surprisingly effective) and Vince Welnick of The Tubes are a hoot as a couple of washed up glam rockers. The fictional punk band, The Looters (fronted by none other than an angry young Ray Winstone) features the talents of Paul Simonon from The Clash and Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols.

Mostly filmed in February 1980, it actually predated the rise of so-called girl bands (e.g., go-gos, bangles, etc.) and hard-core mass manipulation that exploded at that time.

3487071,2,B001B94JWE,"I so much wanted to love this one, but on every level it's simply a drag. A MAJOR drag, due to the fact that the central storyline of this particular girl band becoming cult heroes overnight is totally unbelievable.

These three girls become stars overnight because their motto is ""We Don't Put Out?"" Puh-leez... who wrote this script, Donny Osmond?

Diane Lane's performance is one dimensional, one sour, pouty note hit again and again, and the ensemble acting is cliched and relentlessly dreary with the exception of the very young Ray Winstone, giving a hint of future greatness...

...But even he struggles against an absolutely moronic script. I mean literally without intelligence, literally stupid and senseless. This isn't what backstage looks like, it isn't what life on the road feels like, it's entirely inauthentic. Devoid of fun, devoid of emotion, and after one song entirely devoid of rock. It stuns me that Lou Adler's name is associated with this work, because otherwise I would have to assume that no one associated with it except the ex Clash and Sex Pistols lads had any hands-on knowledge of the rock and roll business.

Speaking of these three actual musicians, any director with a pulse would have seen that these guys had the most interesting and authentic feel about them. Why are they given so few moments on the screen? Blink twice and you miss them.

I'd make a serious wager that this groaner never got released to theaters because it tested so poorly with preview audiences. Unless made up of Girl Scout troops in Salt Lake City and their parents, any test group imaginable would have laughed this turkey off the screen.

Think about what dreck was seen onscreen in those days if it had the slightest rock and roll marketability. Think of the worst film you saw on a theater screen in the late Seventies to early Eighties. Well, this was considered to be WORSE THAN THAT, not even worthy of dumping on the drive-in circuit. Does that tell you anything?

Total dud. The ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of rock and roll movies. But not as well made.

Two stars for Ray Winstone and his bandmates and one fairly cool number. But that's all. Two minutes out of what feels like an endless eternity of bland baloney.

Skip this one and watch Joan Jett in ""Light of Day,"" which looks, sounds, tastes and smells like the real thing.

No laughs here, no guilty pleasure. Just a waste of an hour and a half of your life. Not every lost film is a gem. Sometimes it's just a few reels of garbage that somehow floated to the surface.",1221955200,5,2544,4.671140939597316
3487072,4,B001B94JWE,"Diane Lane is proof that beauty and talent alone are not enough to make you a star. Lane is the daughter of an acting coach and a playboy centerfold, and she has more beauty and talent than any of the other actors of her generation but she has also been in more bad movies than any other actor of her generation.

Although in recent years she has landed roles in some box office hits like A Perfect Storm (2000) and Unfaithful (2002) and thus achieved a kind of belated star status, her best role was her first. In 1979 , she starred with no less than Laurence Olivier in A Little Romance. Because it is wise and smart and relatively cliche-free, this is one of the most appealing coming-of-age films of all-time. After that there were a couple of small but memorable roles in Coppola's S.E. Hinton films, The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (1983), and, later, in Coppola's The Cotton Club (1985). She did take three years off after Cotton Club, but other than that she has worked steadily in mostly forgotten or just plain forgettable films.

And then there is this largely forgotten because seen by so few film from 1982, Ladies and Gentleman the Fabulous Stains. In it, Lane plays a smalltown discontent who makes a splash in the local media when she throws a fit after being fired from her fast food job. Her spunky I've-had-it-with-everything-attitude gives her a local notoriety that makes her unemployable. So, she has little choice but to live the life of a rebel, and pursue the one career opportunity open to just-turned-15 ne'er-do-well rebels: she starts a punk band!

In the early going the film is pretty uneven. Lane herself as Corinne ""third degree"" Burns is always solid but the other performances are just so so. Laura Dern plays a cousin who is also in the band but she rarely speaks, and Christine Lahti plays her sketchy aunt but also utters very few lines. The film achieved its cult status partly because it features Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones and The Clash's Paul Simenon as members of a traveling punk band called The Looters, but these guys do little more than strike poses and lend the film a certain cool just by hanging out in the background. More importantly, the film earned its cult status by being smart about the way the hype-driven record industry exploits both talent and fans. There's even a dig at the then just launched MTV.

Other than Lane, the only real charisma is delivered by Fee Waybill of Tubes fame. The Tubes had some huge hits in the early 70's with ""White Punks on Dope"" and ""Mondo Bondage"" and, in 1982, had yet to make their own big MTV comeback with ""Shes a Beauty"". Here Waybill plays the lead singer of the Metal Corpses, a one-hit-has-been rock act that is running on drug and groupie fumes. Although the character is not developed enough, its actually a pretty good and memorable performance mainly because Waybill doesn't go for Spinal-Tappish laughs but actually crafts a believable character that is humbled not only by having to play the small club circuit in his days of decline but also by having to share a tour bus with a fistful of brash young up-and-comers who think very little of him or his band, The Metal Corpses. There is no peaceful retirment for old rockers, just early death or a long slow fade from glory. Waybill brings  some soul to his part which can't be said of most of the other performances. Particularly weak is the reggae manager who is supposed to be there to lend authenticity to the proceedings but whose presence has just the opposite effect.

But the film is Lane's. Her Corinne Burns is a natural beauty, maybe even a supernatural beauty, and even at 15 she knows how the world works: workers are exploited by corporations, women are exploited by men, art is exploited by industry. Corinne knows that the hardest thing about life is not to sell-out to anything and she eventually learns the hard way that that is easier said than done. Corinne gains fame by voicing and venting the discontent and frustration that her generation of young females feels and the result is she gains a legion of young fans that want to be just like Corinne Burns. But there is also something ruthless about Corinne and The Stains meteoric rise to fame has as much to do with media savvy and knowing just how to use people as it does with talent. Still, there is something irresistable about Corinne veiling her beauty queen good looks behind punk/new wave make-up and spiked and skunk-striped hair. And something not-quite-consistent about the way she preaches about women ""not putting out"" while wearing nothing but fishnet nylons, black panties and a sheer red blouse onstage. But the truthfulness of these observations of the small and the not so small ironies and hypocrisies of fame are what make this film so good.

The film isn't raw enough to have been a hit with the punk crowd, and the film didn't find an audience in this country just like punk didn't find an audience in this country in 1982. In hindsight though the film seems to predict the rise of Madonna and her legions of followers as well as the pop starlets that followed in her wake.

I don't want to over-hype the film. Its probably a three-star film, but the singlemost reason that this film should be viewed is to see Corinne Burns and the Stains do a cheesy MTV promo video for an awesome punk song (penned by Jones and Simenon) called ""I Wanna Be Professional"". The video sums up everything, its a five-star ending to a three-star film.",1221955200,9,5490,4.640946502057613
3487073,3,B001B94JWE,"A young Diane Lane gives one of cinema's most obnoxious performances in history (and I mean it as a compliment - it's a good acting job) in a movie that seemed so great seeing it 25 years ago when you were a teenager, but seeing it now after all those years, awful! You want to feel sorry for Corrine ""3rd Degree"" Burns at the start since she's an orphan but with her nasty attitude you wind up rooting for her downfall at the end.

The ending is classic Hollywood absurdity...just after her fans turn on her as a sellout and her career seemingly over, suddenly and with no explanation she's got a hit record and slick video out! Never mind that her hit song was stolen by her from another band with no threat of a copyright lawsuit, her manager had just dumped her and the rest of her band had run off! Was this ending her wishful fantasy or intended to be real?

There is something Madonna-ish in this story, amazing since it came out only a year or two before she hit it big. I think Madonna must have seen this film and copied the clothes and the attitude into her act.

So if you buy this movie to see it for the first time in years, better give it to your teenage kids, they'll love it, but for the rest of us, I think we're all just too grown up now to still like this movie.",1221609600,,1282,4.140562248995984
3487074,5,B001B94JWE,"I also first saw this on the old Night Flight TV show & was fortunate to record the broadcast. One of my fav trashy films, & it's coming to dvd at last!

Also stars the Tubes Fee Waybill & the late Tubes keyboard player Vince Welnick; + a very young Laura Dern.

Besides being just plain fun & required for Tubes fans (Fee steals the movie), this is also an early indictment of corporate broadcast media.

The picture quality is excellent.  Here's a few tidbits:

1. It's in widescreen (16X9), all the boots I've seen are fullscreen

2. The shower scene does not appear to be cut; it's actually not all that explicit, though Running time is the same as the boots.

3. Only extras are 2 commentaries: 1 from Lane & Dern, & 1 from Adler. The Dern/Lane commentary is really entertaining, though they got a couple facts wrong (Called Vince Welnick the Tubes bass player for one), & the Adler was so boring I gave up after 20 minutes.  The short U-Tube featurettes are NOT on here.

4. No sign of the LP or cd so far. The film credits mentions a soundtrack on Ode Records (Adler's label). I don't remember seeing a soundtrack when it came out.

Fans of R&R cult films should buy this, it doesn't get much better. Liquid Sky is the only similar 80's film that even comes close.",1217116800,5,1271,4.370212765957447

I would love this movie for the music and the Clash/Sex Pistol/Tubes alumi alone, but what I have yet to see mentioned in any of these reviews (my review crossed with ""Steve""'s, thanks Steve.) is the ever fantastic Ray Winstone. (I don't think he's even mentioned in the description...?) ""Stains"" was my first introduction to Mr. Winstone, it made me a fan and to this day I seek out his movies. As far as I'm concerned Diane Lane and Laura Dern were just plain annoying, the music and Ray Winstone are what brings ME back to this movie again and again.",1214006400,3,835,4.5364238410596025

3487078,5,B001B94JWE,"FINALLY! This beloved blast from the past is at long last getting the release it deserves! And it's about bloody time.

I'm sure plenty of other folks my age (yeah, we're getting old!) remember watching this on Night Flight way back in the day. I watched it whenever they ran it and loved it each time ~ Three young girls dream of escaping their depressing small town lives and making it big as a rockin' grrrl band, though they can barely play their instruments or sing, god bless 'em. An opportunity presents itself when a small-time tour bus, with 2 or 3 similarly aspiring bands (one, a sad old group actually trying for a comeback), passes through town. The girls join up and so begins their journey to the top of the charts. But along the way are some hard lessons to learn thanks to: rival bands, song-stealing, leacherous stage managers, washed-up old rockers and fickle fans. Oh, the fickle, fickle fans.

Starring a very young Diane Lane and Laura Dern (who btw is totally awesome), with a good performance from Ray Winstone (who was just as cute then as he is now), this film does have some production flaws especially when compared to today's big-budget high tech ""blockbusters"". The script can be a bit iffy at times, some of the acting is a tad spotty and the photography (at least on the poor quality copies I'm used to) can be downright murky. But hey, it was the beginning of the 80's and I imagine it was no small feat to make even a low-budget independent film. And I think this one STILL rocks.

I'll finally be able to retire my poor old, sad old VHS bootleg. WHOO HOO!",1214006400,10,1590,4.494809688581315
3487079,5,B001B94JWE,"Next to ""The Great Rock n Roll Swindle"", and perhaps equally as ""D.O.A.-A Right of Passage"", this film is a top must have for any punk aficionado. The fictional band in the film, The Looters, features 2 sex PistOls (Paul Cook and Steve Jones) and Clash bassist Paul Simonon performing incredible rock, with 2 songs unavailable on any recording. It's worth it for that alone.
The film also stands on it's own. A very young Diane Lane (pre- ""Outsiders"") turns in a solid performance, and The Tubes Fee Waybil is funny as a Paul Stanley type rocker. Also of note is Brit actor Ray Winstone, who plays the Looters' frontman. As far as underground rebel rock movies go, it doesn't get much better.",1214006400,12,692,4.634146341463414
3487080,2,B001B94JWE,"Nostalgia creates such good memories... but... if one is to be honest, this film is really quite bad. Yes it's interesting to see a very young Laura Dern and Diane Lane but it certainly wasn't as funny or poignant as I remember. It's also odd that many a young female post-punk hopeful find this film such an inspiration when ultimately the movie is about anything but music. I liked Waybill and Welnick, but their parts were tiny, and everyone else's performance was entirely forgettable. When you're 16 this movie might be good, when you're older it's quite horrendous. Maybe that's the point? Either way I was basically reminded of what a lousy era for music the early 80's really were, and that no matter how good the memories you associate with a given film or music, it doesn't make that film or music particularly good.

If this is an official DVD release, there'd better be a slew of compelling special features to counter-balance the main feature.",1214006400,7,956,4.759036144578313

The movie is abysmal. The acting is so sub-par, I think a new scale of ""crap"" is reached. HOWEVER: it is here we can here the song, ""Join the Professionals"" from the budding Jones/Cook ex-Pistols project, aptly named, the Professionals.

No one really should've asked Jones and Cook to act after seeing their thespian skills in ""The Great Rock n' Roll Swindle,"" but all in all, a cool thing for Jonesy fans like myself.

If you watch the film in a MST3K state of mind, it's entertaining. Just watch for the Professionals songs.

8282344,4,B001B94JWE,"Possible spoilers.  I saw something in a magazine article recently highlighting this obscure film.  It sounded interesting and featured future stars Diane Lane, Laura Dern, Ray Winstone, Christine Lahti and others.  It was made in 1980 and 81 and directed by music producer, Lou Adler.  It was written by Nancy Dowd, probably best known for Coming Home.  She didn't get along with Adler and didn't like the finished product so she is credited as Rob Morton.

The story is about a pair of orphaned sisters.  Diane Lane, who was 15 at the time, plays the older sister (17?), Corinne Burns.  Her sister, Tracy is played by Marin Kanter.  She was 21, so go figure.  Ms. Kanter only made one more movie before calling it a career.  The Burns sisters, along with their cousin Jessica (13 year old Laura Dern), decide to leave their crummy Pennsylvania town and Jessicas mother Linda (Christine Lahti) and form a band.  Never mind they don't play instruments and lead singer Corinne isn't very good.  Corinne takes in a punk rock show featuring a band called The Looters fronted by a Brit named Billy (Ray Winstone).  The rest of the band is played by Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Paul Simonon, all real musicians.  Corinne goes back stage to talk to the band but they ignore her.

Corinne gains some notoriety when a news crew films her quitting her restaurant job.  It leads to the stations female anchor, Alicia Meeker (Cynthia Sikes) doing an interview.  Corinnes angry demeanor gathers some attention, especially with other teen girls.  The trio get a gig opening up for The Looters and bomb horribly, but Corinne takes on one of the guys up front who is taunting her.  She actually is addressing all the girls in the audience, suggesting they are being subjugated by their boyfriends and others.  She proudly states that shes perfect and doesnt put out.  It becomes a catch phrase for teen girls overnight and they begin to pack shows dressed like Corinne, who changes her look by wearing briefs over stockings and a see through top.  She dies her hair in multiple hues and somehow young Diane Lane becomes one surly bad-ass.

When Billy becomes interested in her both professionally and sexually, the pair head for a local no-tell-motel.  In what is apparently a one-off for Corinne, she accepts Billys advances heading into the shower.  And yes, there is nudity.  Im not sure how the film ever got released with a 15 year old doing an ever-so-brief scene like this.  Well, actually the film never got released.  It did show up years later on the USA TV network and even later on a few film festivals.  Several female rockers have mentioned how the film influenced them.

As far as the movie?  Well it really isn't very good.  Winstone shows some acting chops and Lahti has a nice scene but this really is Diane Lanes movie.  Her petulant teen is well played.  Lane shows she has what it takes.  Shes in virtually every scene.  Lane would go on to make Streets of Fire a couple years later, playing essentially the same character.  Both movies are worth checking out.",1494374400,,3065,4.713207547169811
