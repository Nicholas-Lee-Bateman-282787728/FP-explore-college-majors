7839894,5,6303170749,Thank you for the VHS tapes!  They arrived promptly and in great shape.  I recommend this seller 100%.  So thankful to receive these.  My mother had these tapes back in the day and I wanted to begin practicing yoga again and wasn't able to locate them.  I appreciate you having these in stock.  Thanks again!,1398297600,,308,4.509090909090909
7839895,5,6303170749,"A great, relaxing series to help the body and mind. I used to practice with Lilias on PBS many years ago but unfortunately, her Lilias, Yoga and You series hasn't been shown on my PBS stations for years. So, I'm trying to collect all of her tapes that are available.

I had major surgery plus chemo and was looking for something for my body and mind that was relaxing yet effective. Lilias yoga fit the bill perfectly! I've been able to regain strength, range of motion, and mental calmness by using her tapes. Unlike other exercise videos, I actually look forward to doing these videos.

Three of the four workouts in this series are also sold separately under the names: ""Breathing & Stretching Workout Series for Beginners"", ""Relaxation & Fitness Workout Series for Beginners"", and ""Meditation Workout Series for Beginners."" I mistakenly bought these not knowing they were duplicates, but that's OK because now I have spares in case the first tapes give out. All have the picture of Lilias dressed in a green top with blue pants with her chin on her hands.",1291852800,,1059,4.75
7839896,3,6303170749,"This tape is actually quite a good beginner's yoga tape. Lilias is a calm, assured, knowledgeable instructor.

However, I gave this product only 3 stars because this tape has exactly the same content as this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lilias-Alive-with-Yoga-Beginner/dp/630294855X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lilias! Alive with Yoga: Beginner</a>&nbsp;It has a different title and different packaging, but is exactly the same tape.

I already had Alive with Yoga, and am very disappointed that I purchased a duplicate copy that was packaged as if it were completely different material. I'll be giving this tape away as a gift.",1238371200,3,678,6.43956043956044
7839897,5,6303170749,"I was nervous about trying a yoga tape for the first time. I'm not flexible in any way, even though I'm in relativly good shape. At first, I was wary, it seemed rather cheesy, but this video has four 20 minute secessions walking you through every move in detail. I felt like I had a personal trainer. Every time my posture or form was wrong she would point it out. She knew just where a beginners weakness would be. I've only gone through the first half of the video, but I can't wait to master this program and move onto the rest of Lilias' workouts. I must say this is THE BEST video to try for a true beginner. (anyone with any experience would probably find it too simple) after a few days of using it, I've already gotten multiple comments how how I carry my self with a more relaxed confidence. (I've had a habit of slouching) I recommend this video to any beginner who want to SLOWLY work their way to those crazy legs behind the neck moves.",1110844800,8,948,4.272222222222222
7839898,5,6303170749,"Lilia Folan, im my opinion ,is the QUEEN of YOGA, for the at HOME VHS Workout market! She keeps things SIMPLE! DOESN'T over work you ,and again,in MY OPINION KEEPS YOUR INTEREST! That's USUALLY what STOPS me from completely a YOGA program, or NAY WORKOUT program..BORDOM,NOT BELIEVING that I can acheive results you are supposed to as described DESCRIBED ON THE JACKETS!WITH THIS INSTRUCTOR.....NEVER FEAR!
You WILL see AMAZING results in a relatively short period of time ,if you just work out a few min's a day,or breal up the workout for JUST 3-4 days a week! I LOST a TOTAL of 8 inches! Went from a size 9 to a size 6! IM ONLY 5'3""!! I felt over weight....out of shape adn VERY unhealthy! at 135 lbs, not at 120 lbs, but look VERY MUCH in SHAPE! BIT ALSO.....I FEEL HEALTHY!...and my GOOD friends tell me that I look like I had plastic surgery and REFUSE to belive I DIDNT! LOL I LOVE LILIAS!!!!!!!!!
SHE IS MY! YOGA IDOL!
Cant go wrong with ANY of her tapes!",1077321600,7,963,4.415730337078652
7839899,4,6303170749,"My husband and I have both used and enjoyed this video even though neither of us has ever tried yoga before. We're both in our fifties, and we found all of the stretches and exercises very possible to do. The stress relief is immediate, and the feeling of calm well-being after finishing it is very nice.",999216000,29,304,4.446428571428571
7839900,5,6303170749,"I find Lilias' manner to be calming and the yoga stretching and  strengthening exercises she takes us through to be both relaxing and  invigorating.  Since I was just starting out, I did feel the effects of the  work-out the next day...that little bit of soreness in those unused  muscles!  I feel that this is just the beginning; a good and simple  work-out providing steps toward promoting strength and flexibility.  And it  does wonders for relieving stress and bringing balance into my day!",965952000,23,494,4.926829268292683
7839901,4,6303170749,I borrowed these tapes from a friend and am now buying them. Even though they were a bit grainy the content more than made up for it. The poses weren't that difficult and the author made you feel quite relaxed. Can't wait to get my own tapes,952732800,7,241,4.148936170212766
