I haven't seen his latter film yest but as seeing this film, I cannot wait to see that too,
<THE RIGHT DISTANCE> was a stunningly beautiful work of art, heart rendering drama about suspect, discrimination and above all, love.

I had an Arabic friend and he betrayed me big time and now I am fighting with him at court as well but that doesn't mean necesarrily that all Arabs are bad. There are tones and tone of honest good Arabs out there and this movie is about an Arab man who happens to fall in love with an Italian woman. But sadly when he asks her to marry him, she kind of hesitates and tells him that she will go to another country.
They are not sure that they will meet again or what their future will be like.
Then for some strange reason, the woman got killed.
All the people are suspicious that the killer is the Arab guy since they had a small quarrel before she died and they knew that the lady refused the marrage.

But this guy is a good one and he will never kill anyone.
He with his dignity kills himself to proove his innocence.

The boy who wants to be a journalist wants to prove his innocents keeps dig the truth even after his death and ends up proving it at the end.

The charactorizing the each actors are so very great.
Especially the main actress Valentina Lodovini is so very charming and adorable to look at through out the movie. It was just blessing to look at her.
The Arab guy was so very tender and fragile that i almost wanted to support his love towards the woman he loves. First it begins with coming to her house peaking at her. Every moment what she does. He just stands in the dark looks at her  just like one of those freaks. But he ain't a freak.
He is just shy and knows that he is an Arab.
Then one day he approaches her and he made it!
She accepts his love.
He is like a mountain. A solid man who can take care of her. He has this deep lake like eyes that is so deep that she can almost fall deep inside his eyes.
So he made love with him.
Then everything became normal. It seemed.
But the marrage.
People wants to get deeply involved when they truely fall in love.

The camera work is amazing. The location is just heart stopping.
The local place where the story is happening is pure canvas like art.
You should have had seen this movie in a big screen. I should have had too.

This is a must see art film with something to think of after watching it.
Everyone should be equal an they should not be judged by where they came from or what their skin color is or what their religion is or what they look like.",1465257600,,2763,4.182330827067669
