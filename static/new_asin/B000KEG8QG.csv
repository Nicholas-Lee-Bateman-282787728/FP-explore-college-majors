Why you should not buy this DVD: because it is mostly Cindy Blackman playing drums in various settings.

If you're looking for a step-by-step instructional video, this is not going to satisfy you at all. But if you want an inspirational drum video, then you'll love this one. There are some bits here and there where she offers an exercise or explains a technique, but these are extremely brief and not very deep or well presented. The performances, however, are incendiary.

Cindy is an odd drummer in some ways. Her technique looks stiff and awkward, mostly played with arms and, as she says, no bounce. And she mostly channels Tony Williams (with uncanny accuracy, it must be said). In any other drummer, that kind of technique and derivative style would be a death sentence musically, but in Cindy's case, they are meaningless details. She plays with such fire, such passion, such dynamic expression and reckless reach that everything else is moot. And she plays some monstrously difficult stuff despite her seemingly awkward technique (it obviously isn't as awkward as it looks).

So many drummers these days play with technical precision and clocklike accuracy, and often they play things that would have seemed impossible 20 years ago. But for the most part, these drummers are sunk by their own perfection. They're impressive intellectually, but boring emotionally. Cindy is like a force of nature, a whirlwind, and she drives the band hard. In fact, some might even say she is overplaying most of the time. But I would argue she is not dominating the band, she is pushing it, and that's a crucial difference. She makes everyone around her play better and harder. And that's what she'll do for you, too.",1410480000,5,1811,4.911764705882353
