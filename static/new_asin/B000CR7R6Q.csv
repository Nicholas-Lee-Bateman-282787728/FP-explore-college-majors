2470470,2,B000CR7R6Q,"The main character is a painter/bum who will obviously break up with his girlfriend in the first act of the movie.  He will then have to learn to take care of himself.  He'll have to gain inspiration for his art and fall in love again.  This is a straight-ahead no twists or turns free fall, and I'm talking in a very disappointing kind of way.  Nothing worth noting in the film.",1173052800,4,379,4.295774647887324
2470471,5,B000CR7R6Q,"This movie will could never win an oscar, but it was just a nice sweet fun boy gets girl story with a rather good little message in it about feeling sorry for yourself. I recommend it!",1168473600,2,184,4.138888888888889
2470472,4,B000CR7R6Q,"Disregard the previous arrogant and huffy review and take this movie for what it is - a sweet, silly romp meant to entertain, not probe the inner brain or elevate one to some erudite state of false wisdom.  In fact, the movie itself pokes fun at that very type of pomposity in the art world.  As romantic comedies go, it is refreshing and not so saccharine sweet as some.  It is quirky and cool, in part because none of the actors are well known to this date except for Mark Ruffalo, who manages perfection in every cinematic genre he works with.  Beth Ulrich was sexy in a so not cliche way, and the rest of the supporting cast are just plain fun, and very, very good.  No, you may not come away feeling intellectually enlightened, but you probably will have a smile on your face, and that's probably the point.  The DVD has extra scenes interspersed throughout the closing credits, so don't stop watching.  Also, there's a great interview with Mark Ruffalo who, again, is always fascinating to watch and listen to.",1148515200,15,1016,4.549450549450549
2470473,4,B000CR7R6Q,"This is an uplifting, low budget, independently produced film set in Los Angeles. It is about a confused intellectual yet a shallow artist who is trying to make it in the competitive world of art and in the process finds love. This is not a very serious film but one that will cheer you up on a dull, rainy day. Mark Ruffalo is excellent in his portrayal of Alex, and most of the characters in this film are at times over the top. But isn't life just like that? Sometimes we all meet people who are just very eccentric! I love the dialogues in this movie. Apartment 12 is a light hearted comedy about an artist, the girl next door and the neighbors in a low rent apartment building.",1144800000,11,682,4.294573643410852

8100963,5,B000CR7R6Q,"I was entertained, i laughed, and it was not entirely predictable where the plot was headed. That's enough for me to recommend this movie. So low budget! Yet, so funny and really well-written. Not the wittiest or most clever dialogue but very appropriate language and thought for this particular group of people.

Almost all the action takes place in the narrow confines of one floor of an apartment building. I love that idea - who has not had their world shrunk to the floor of a building at some time in their lives? This, and the array of characters that surrounds the star, Mark Ruffalo, who truly shines in this role. My favorite scene is when he meets his sexy neighbor while emptying his garbage. She reduces him to a giggling schoolboy and he really succeeds in being so un-charming, so un-sexy, so un-Mark Ruffalo!",1508025600,,824,4.682758620689655
