This anime was a lot fun to watch. There are a lot of great gags and fun comedy. The silliness isn't too much, too mask the seriousness of the strong feelings they share. The animation is good and the voice acting is too. One of the unique things about this anime is the soundtrack. It has a lighthearted and playful vibe that suits the show perfectly. All in all this is a series I strongly recommend it to any anime fan.",1354752000,,811,4.266233766233766
8159290,3,B000KWZ1WA,"I love this series but funimation released a lemon this volume.

The 5.1 audio in episode #16 is NOT right.

Seems that the center channel plays on the front right speaker and there is no sound for the front left speaker.

Other than this one episode the rest of the DVD seems fine.",1172534400,,282,4.283018867924528
