1059466,2,630570189X,"Presented by Image, the 1952 ANOTHER MAN'S POISON directed by Irving Rapper and starring Bette Davis is a British production that curiously enters the DVD market before the major movies of the american star. Adapted by Val Guest from a play, the action takes place most of the time in the mansion of Bette Davis who plays a mystery writer living in beautiful english landscapes. She loves horseriding so we have the opportunity to admire the country every 20 minutes or so. When she doesn't ride, she is smoking, drinking or plotting the death of the man who has replaced her husband ; by the way, she has killed her real husband in the first three minutes of the movie.
The screenplay of ANOTHER MAN'S POISON is one of the most ridiculous I have seen in months but who cares after all, we are here for the Bette Davis show. And I must admit that the show is worth a look, the great lady giving a lesson of acting during 90 minutes. Gary Merrill plays the false husband with conviction but doesn't have the slightest chance against Bette Davis.
No subtitles but an extensive filmography of Bette Davis as extra-feature. Average to above-average sound and images.
A DVD zone Bette Davis ultra-hard fans.",981417600,7,1202,4.647887323943662

BUT.. it is a fun film to view... too see how hard Miss Davis works to entertain her audience!  Yes she overacts in this film... she has  to... it storyline is bad...the direction is bad.  See this film for the  fun of it!  You get to see her act with her then husband, Gary Merrill.  Yes Miss Davis's character is a bad women... but nobody is as bad as Miss  Davis when she is bad!",950400000,4,469,3.978494623655914

If you LOVE Bette Davis, then you need this movie. The only reason I did not get it before now was that the asking price was like 130.00 something $'s on DVD. Even though I was tempted to pay that price for it, I could not bring myself to do it.

1059874,3,630570189X,"The draw of this film for us was Bette Davis. If you are an FOB (fan of Bette), this is a vintage effort. The story is a little different involving a fading star who is having a ""relationship"" with younger man who himself is cheating on his fiancee. A colleague of her missing and assumed dead husband appears looking for stolen bonds about which she knows nothing. She seems to want a relationship with the husband's former bud, doesn't love the younger man but wants to possess him. Without giving away the resolution of the conflict, some of the assumptions are little bit of a leap. This apparently was an independent production and film noir genre as well. The production doesn't have the quality of a major studio. One gets the feeling the film is a place holder for BD or  was a personal investment until a better script comes along.",1464134400,,840,4.562913907284768

Bette Davis doesn't have to work very hard through much of this, but when she does, she's classic. The toy boy love interest and his real love interest are a little pale but and the country vet is a cut-out, but Davis and Merrill carry this off like a stage play, he's always coarse but not overbearing, Davis is always one brick shy of a load but not obviously nuts. Edgy and manipulative, both of them. Worth the time to watch it.

1060062,4,630570189X,"This drama highlights the talents  Bette Davis and Gary Merrill.  I highly disagree with other comments that it is boring movie. It is not an action adventure film, no blood, nudity and sex.  In fact, no one even uses any profanity.  This is one of those films in which the murder gets entrapped in their own schemes.  Hollywood loves to produces these kind of movies because the audience is always waiting to find out what character will eventually bring justice upon the villain or villains.

 It is black and white film, the exterior night scenes are too dark to see and the interior scenes suffer from poor production design. (I believe Amazon is showing a poor reproduction of this film.) I've seen this film three times on TV.  Amazon was my first time viewing without commercial interruptions.  The TV version had a much better film quality than the Amazon version.

The large furniture gets in way in all the interior scenes.  I feel like actors are trying hard to keep from running into the large furniture crammed into a tiny set.  The music is terrible also, too loud for  many of the scenes.

Some weak points: What was the purpose of the Doctor with holding the key piece of information for a week?  Why did the maid keep quite about the husband's identity?  Did the Doctor tell the truth about the horse's death?

 It is definitely a film for fans of Davis and Merrill, because they are superb actors, but probably not worth watching for those who want a solid thriller.",1422144000,,1484,4.620689655172414

As always, Bette Davis is a presence on the screen and the supporting cast did a nice job. The storyline had several moving parts but at times had holes in the plot and some events that seemed implausible or too predictable. This is not on my list of must see Davis films but found it on Amazon Prime and was curious.
Even with that said I would recommend viewing this film mainly because it does have Bette Davis and the story does hold some interest. You won't feel like you wasted the hour and a half but probably will not think you just saw a classic either.",1409270400,,702,4.161764705882353
1060178,2,630570189X,"The principal character is a published writer of mystery books, but is not ""Jessica Fletcher"" of ""Murder, She Wrote"".  Indeed, the principal character here is manipulative, self-centered, and just plain crazy. But all this is carefully covered up and revealed bit by bit in the skillful acting of Bette Davis and her then husband, Gary Merrill. Gary Merrill  displays a lot of depth and real strength, although his character, also, is manipulative.

  The movie is billed as a film noir, so I had hope of lovely , shadowy, deliberately dark, misleading camera work.

  Well, the initial credits roll over camera-work of someone walking near water and going into a phone booth.  Fine. Throughout, in exterior scenes, other nice camera-work shows the utter beauty that is Yorkshire.

 Horses are beautiful, and empathy with something in the film could have been created by even a few careful camera-shots of horses, especially Fury, the murderess's favorite  horse.

 I am sorry the two bratty lovers rode their horses full speed  into a flock of beautiful sheep, causing at least one sheep to scream.
 It does cry out.
  Sheep require guidance, as we all know, and
 they  really can't figure out how to step aside to avoid being trampled.
 I am sorry the producers of this film didn't step aside.

The film was an opportunity for Bette Davis  to turn on the tour-de-force acting skills that smolder within: she is indeed impressive  as a  murderess who confesses the deed almost from frame one, and I can only hope for Gary Merrill's sake that Bette Davis in private life did not resemble this character.  The film resembles a  sad, clunky play and I looked for elevation of thought but found none, even with Emlyn Williams who re-wrote the script.

  As sometimes in life, the only saintly ones are the secretary and the maid.  This is just wretched stuff, with clumsy treatment of cruel deeds, but there are interesting moments for Miss Davis' and Mr. Merrill's  gifts to shine , so, if you're  a fan and don't mind having your higher aspirations flogged to death, go ahead.  Too bad, though.  Needs elevation ,  up up.",1406851200,,2120,4.824022346368715

1060402,2,630570189X,"Bette Davis, as we all know, is an American icon, a legendary American movie star, a great American movie actress, winner of multiple Academy Awards and many Academy Award nominations.  But this doesn't mean that the acting of the feisty, volatile, tempestuous screen star was always good.  She was at her best in the 1930s and 1940s (and in 1950's All About Eve).  In some of her work in the 1950s, she lapsed into Bette Davis playing caricatures of Bette Davis, and this is one of those unfortunate occasions (an earlier one is her performance in Beyond the Forest, 1949).
The vehicle here is a dated, stagy melodrama which must have looked tired even in 1951, and must have appealed only as a showy vehicle for Davis.  She stars here with her recent husband Gary Merrill, after their successful collaboration in All About Eve.  Davis still seems to be playing the part of Margo Channing here; it's a very actressy performance.  In addition to being over the top, she's over the hill for the part; she looks overweight and overripe (after all, she'd been making movies for 20 years at this point), hardly the femme fatale who could lure handsome young Anthony Steel away from his much more attractive young fiancee Barbara Murray.
Bette's overdone, actressy performance, replete with lots of eyeball rolling, cigarette lighting and smoking, and cocktail pouring and drinking, combined with a conventional performance from Merrill and the dated, stagy melodrama, cardboard characters, and obvious contrivances of this play, makes for an undistinguished film that is no credit to the Davis filmography.  Even the cinematography (this is an independent British production) is bad; it's too dark and has the grainy look of an early TV kinescope.  The only memorable feature is the polished performance of Emlyn Williams as an annoying busybody veterinarian constantly sticking his nose into his neighbors' business.",1056326400,9,1913,5.0894568690095845
1060403,1,630570189X,Dreary Davis vehicle which should never have been made. She's a famous authoress living in England who murders an inconvenient ex-husband. She's having it off with her secretary's boyfriend (who's much younger) and thinks she's pulled off the perfect crime (she's a mystery writer) until a former partner of the husband's shows up. He offers to cover for her but things get ridiculously out of hand and he kills her prize horse. This is not good. Then begins a game of wills that ends most ironically as Davis falls prey to her own schemes. She hams it up in this one and leaves no co-star unscathed. Murky b&w photography doesn't help either. It's slow and very stagy throughout. Her then husband Gary Merrill plays the partner and even he seems at a loss over how to cope with the script. If a Davis film can be called a total waste then this is it. Even she can't save it from sinking into tedious boredom. Stick with her other films instead and forget this turkey.,1035849600,4,968,4.568965517241379
1060404,3,630570189X,"This film, based upon the play ""Deadlock"" by Leslie Sands, is not one of those films that will make the viewer stand up and cheer. Were it not for Bette Davis, it would probably not even merit a viewing, so improbable is the script with which she has to work. The other cast members, as well, have thankless roles.
Davis lights up the screen as mystery novelist, Janet Frobisher, who lives in isolated splendor on the Yorkshire moors in England. Her nearest neighbor is the local busy body and veterinarian, Dr. Henderson, a role gamely played by Emlyn Williams. Frobisher, a selfish, amoral vixen, falls in love with her secretary's fiance, Larry (Anthony Steele). One little problem stands in her way of eternal bliss. She, herself, is married to a man with a criminal past, one with whom she has had little contact in recent years. In the first few minutes of the film, it is revealed that she has single handedly and cold bloodedly dispatched her husband, who has had the misfortune to show up unexpectedly, to the great beyond. Unfortunately for her, she gets an unwelcome, surprise visitor on the heels of her murderous act, when her husband's partner in crime, George Bates, shows up looking for him.
The improbable storyline that follows is kept afloat by Ms. Davis alone. Gary Merrill, the real life husband of Bette Davis at the time, stoically and woodenly  plays the thankless role of George Bates. He, as well as the rest of the cast, fades into the background, when on screen with Ms. Davis. Even Ms. Davis, however, is unable to keep this clunker totally afloat. Stagey, with leaden dialogue and a ridiculous premise, this film would have immediately tanked, were it not for the Ms. Davis. Struggling valiantly with this turkey, Ms. Davis smokes, drinks, kills, and loves, as only Ms. Davis can, with over the top acting that manages to make the viewer stay with the film. Davis devotees will, undoubtedly, enjoy this film, despite its many flaws.
This no frills DVD offers little more than an extensive list of Ms. Davis' films by way of special features. The sound and picture quality of this ninety minute, black and white film, however, is good.",1022198400,13,2164,4.770666666666667
1060405,1,630570189X,"To the point : There is no doubt that Bette Davis is the greatest actress in the world. She was at the right time and the right place, and above all she was talented. Meryl Streep have the same kind of success that Bette had,unfortunately we don't have too many great roles today for great actress like Streep. For you fans, I think you won't find any meat to sink your teeth in Another Man's Posion. If you really want to see Bette's best performance apart from the obvious like All about Eve, Dark Victory, Now Voyager, etc Maybe you should see Mr Skeffington, Dead Ringer, The Anniversary or even Beyond Forest Bette's last film with Warner which she thought was really bad. But, apart form miscasting Joseph Cotten, Bette can turned a bad film to a watch-able one. ...",1010534400,4,772,4.521428571428571
1060406,3,630570189X,"Celebrated mystery writer Janet Frobisher (Davis) - who lives in a secluded mansion on the Yorkshire moors - is in love with Larry (Anthony Steele), a young engineer engaged to marry her secretary (Barbara Murray)..........It is fascinating watching Bette Davis, a superb screen actress if ever there was one, play everything in a blaze of breathtaking absurdity. The melodramatic gamut seldom has experienced the workout it is given in ANOTHER MAN'S POISON, a wild and fanciful saga where Davis, queen of the vixens, combs her hair, lights cartons of cigarettes, snaps her fingers and bites her consonants! No one has ever accused Davis of failing to rise to a good script; what this shows is how far she could go to meet a bad one. It's obvious that director Irving Rapper let Bette basically direct herself, for the same zealous overplaying isn't evident among the other cast members. Not to be missed by Davis fans! - it's safe to say that there are few things in the cinema quite like it. Based upon the play DEADLOCK by Leslie Sands, this little flick from 1952 was made in England and was, interestingly enough, produced by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.",1003104000,3,1153,4.8578680203045685

This disk is just passable as an HD production, and not much scintillating clarity in here that usually shows up in higher quality Blu-rays.
