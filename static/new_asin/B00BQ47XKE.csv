5665321,3,B00BQ47XKE,It's an enjoyable film about the real Fitzgerald and Zelda story.  I loved the movie Great Gatsby and this is a good background film.,1388448000,,133,4.541666666666667
5665322,5,B00BQ47XKE,"I'm thrilled that I bought this, but saddened at what I now know to be true about Fitzgerald's life. That being said, it's good to know the true stories and events leading to the composition of the epic novel, ""The Great Gatsby."" The product arrived in good condition and on time. I would recommend this to those interested in learning more about the history of the Gatsby novel. It is a rich history.",1387152000,,401,4.506849315068493
5665323,5,B00BQ47XKE,"This DVD includes the BBC version of bonus material to enrich viewer understanding of ""The Great Gatsby"" novel, the movie of the same name and the Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald.  This material is presented in two main menu choices titled ""The Great Gatsby:  Midnight In Manhattan"" and ""Private Affairs:  A Dream Of Living.""  The DVD begins with miscellaneous unrelated material that requires five clicks of the ""skip"" button to arrive at the main menu.  Once there, clicking on the ""Midnight In Manhattan"" choice leads to material that discusses Fitzgerald's roots in Minnesota, his move to and love for New York City, his ability to make vague descriptions of New York, Manhattan, Long Island, The American Dream and the 1920s Jazz age more condensed and tangible than people in general or other authors could.

A narrator introduces these topics, then turns over the presentation to a series of distinguished, thoughtful and aging writers including George Plimpton, William Styron, Norman Mailer, Hunter Thompson and Garrison Keillor.  The first four of these authors tended to identify ""The Great Gatsby"" as a dark novel emphasizing how The American Dream falsely encourages people to think that if they are good looking, well prepared and persistent, they can do anything, leading to aiming too high, failure and death.  Garrison Keillor saw the views of the other authors as reasonable, but did not himself see ""The Great Gatsby"" as being so dark, but saw it as addressing the idea that when everyone sets their eyes on a distant goal, it is normal to aim high, then row their boats hard against the currents of life and see what happens while realizing that we all know that we eventually must die.  I have taken some liberties with what these authors believe, but I loved listening what they had to say and hope others will take it in and make up their own minds.

The ""Dream Of Living"" choice in the main menu leads to a play based on the personal, home and social lives of F. Scott Fitzgerald, his wife Zelda and Ernest Hemingway.  The first time I started watching it, the actor playing Fitzgerald looked remarkably like the Gatsby writer, but his accent sounded like a harsh, fake Northeastern America version with no Minnesota influence, Hemingway sounded similar with no Illinois influence and Zelda sounded like someone with an exaggerated and faked Southeastern America accent.  When I realized this play started out with the trivial details of daily life, I gave up on it and shut it down.

A few days later, I tried it again, found I could get used to the actors and learned a lot from it.  Watching turned out to be rewarding, even though the lifestyles revealed seem stupid and repulsive.",1384646400,2,2711,4.877995642701525
5665324,3,B00BQ47XKE,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD..I thought it will be a documentary that will give me an insight to Scott Fitzgerald's thinking process, his perception of his character, if he saw himself as Gatsby etc...

it is a good documentary but not to my expectation.",1378771200,,264,4.617021276595745
5665325,5,B00BQ47XKE,"and it was well worth the wait.  Fascinating man, fascinating story.  Excellent production.  If you are at all interested in Mr. Fitzgerald and his work, you will be pleased with this dvd.",1376784000,,188,4.8125
5665326,3,B00BQ47XKE,I love all the different versions of Gatsby. I just wanted a little background. This gives you a little background.,1371513600,2,115,4.8
5665327,3,B00BQ47XKE,"The title attraction on this DVD is quite disappointing.  It is 49 minutes of a variety of literary, luminary talking heads who say, in fact, very little about Fitgerald, his life, his wife, his writing and most particularly the ostensible subject of this documentary, THE GREAT GATSBY.  The 75th Anniversary of the publication of this
greatest of 20th century novels surely deserved a much more in-depth and inspired approach than is to be found herein.

The decided delight of this disc is to be found in the little known extra.  PRIVATE AFFAIRS: A DREAM OF LIVING is a BBC production from 1975.  Late, great David Hemmings plays F. Scott Fitzgerald wonderfully - and looks very much like the writer as well.  The drama covers one day and night in the life of Scott and Zelda along with Hemingway and assorted cronies.  It is worth the price of purchase and more than makes up for the disappointing main fare.",1368403200,19,911,4.727848101265823
5665328,4,B00BQ47XKE,"I knew this might not be a new documentary when the opening scenes showing the Brooklyn Bridge and the New York City skyline still showed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. It's not till late in the 41-minute film that you realize that it was made in 2000, before the 9/11 tragedy. This really has not much effect on enjoying the program (produced by the BBC) except when - again late in the program - there is discussion of the financial ""bubble"" and when it is (actually ""was"") going to burst.

Being released to catch the interest in F. Scott Fitzgerald and his ""Great American Novel"" with the release this month of Baz Lurman's 3-D ""Musical"" version, the program provides observations on the author from such fellow authors (then living in 2000) as George Plympton, William Styron, Norman Mailer, Hunter S. Thompson and Garrison Keillor. We also hear from Fitzgerald's former secretary - who was there when he died in 1939 at age 44. Fitzgerald's granddaughter narrates the program.
To fill in the DVD, BBC has added a TV drama on Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, (with David Hemmings playing the author) titled ""A Dream of Living"". This 1975 program runs 52 minutes, and was a good choice.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8572399,5,B00BQ47XKE,I purchased this both for myself and for the college library where I work.  It gives a good critical insight into the social forces at play during the 1920s that elucidate that period for students of Gatsby and American 20th Century literature and history.,1491264000,,256,4.818181818181818
8572400,4,B00BQ47XKE,Very good and interesting take on Fitzgerald and Hemmingway.,1456272000,,60,5.777777777777778

8572402,4,B00BQ47XKE,"Being generous and giving it 4 stars because I love anything Gatsby- and I am glad I bought it. If you are a big fan, you should get it. The special feature of the ""play"" is just OK, I started watching it and kind of skipped through it to the end.",1452988800,,247,3.8627450980392157
8572403,3,B00BQ47XKE,"Not what we expected. Documentary was good with pictures and history of F. Scott's life, but special feature Private Affairs, a Dream of Living, was too intense with arguments and troubles between the author and his wife. It does show the wife's decent into insanity, but ends before she is committed.",1426982400,3,301,4.921568627450981
8572404,5,B00BQ47XKE,very good,1407456000,,9,4.0
8572405,5,B00BQ47XKE,"THIS WAS REALLY VERY GOOD. I HAVE RECENTLY BEE READING FITZGERALD AND WATCHED ALL 4 MOVIES OF ""THE GREAT GATSBY.""  Also, I have read a lot about what Hemingway had to say about Fitzgerald, who was one of Fitzgerald great admirers. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone that likes that period of time.",1399075200,,321,4.5344827586206895
8572406,5,B00BQ47XKE,"This was a good video to play to introduce my 11th graders to Gatsby. They actually enjoyed it! It does have one word of profanity (gd) in case you or your students are bothered by this. Otherwise, totally suitable for this age group.",1394841600,3,234,4.465116279069767
8572407,4,B00BQ47XKE,"While it is slightly out of date (being from 2000), my high school students quite enjoyed it. Plus, with a run time of 49 minutes, I could show it in one class period as a nice wrap-up to my Gatsby series. Interesting points of view, good vistas, and nice and short.",1393200000,,266,4.235294117647059
8572408,5,B00BQ47XKE,"Great documentary that came out in the early 2000s. If you teach Gatsby, I recommend it. Use it in class. If you enjoy learning about Scott and Zelda, see how their lives intersect with the novel.",1392768000,,196,4.472222222222222
