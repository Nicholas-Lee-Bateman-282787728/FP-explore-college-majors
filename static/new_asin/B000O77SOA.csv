2791889,5,B000O77SOA,"One of the best shows ever made- come on release the other seasons. Lee Majors, Heather Thomas, Douglas Barr made a winning combination with Glen Larson's masterpiece production. Each episode starts off with an action scene similar to a James Bond movie, and just gets better from there. Excellent acting, stunt work and music make this series a must to own. Thank you Glen and Lee for such a wonderful show.",1361404800,2,408,4.76056338028169

2791893,5,B000O77SOA,This 1st season series was fantastic.  Unfortunately seasons 2 - 5 are not yet available on DVD.  Whoever decides DVD production of this series should immediately put the other 4 years as soon as possible.  Those buying only the first season are hanging by a thread to see the rest of them!,1295568000,3,290,4.538461538461538
2791894,4,B000O77SOA,"The second half of the first season of the Fall Guy pretty much follows the same pattern as the first.  Colt Seavers (Lee Majors) works as a stunt man but moonlights as a bounty hunter to pay the bills.  He gets his assignments from Samantha Jack (Jo Ann Pflug).  Working along side him is his cousin Howie Munson (Douglas Barr).  Also on hand when needed is Jody Banks (Heather Thomas).

In this half of the season, Colt takes on a shady manager in the world of women's wrestling, attempts to save a friend's son from the mob, helps an old friend escape her crooked politician husband, and tracks down $5 million that was stolen from the Navy five years ago.

The one thing that has changed is the guest stars.  The first half of the season featured cameos by famous actors and actresses of the early 80's.  There's only one cameo in this set, Herve Villechaize.  However, that hardly matters.  The stunts aren't quite as elaborate, although we do get some pretty intense skiing and awesome car chases.

Even though this is only the second half of the season, you still get half the extras from the full season set.  The last disc of the set contains a 5 minute featurette on the theme song.  About the only thing interesting about it is they sing the full song.  Who knew there were more verses, right?

If you pay attention, you can get the full season set for less then the two half sets cost.  Personally, I'd wait and get the entire season at once.",1192665600,9,1454,4.450757575757576
