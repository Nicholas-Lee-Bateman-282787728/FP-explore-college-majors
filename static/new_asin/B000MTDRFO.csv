8172262,3,B000MTDRFO,The film is a documentary on the latest craze in 3d technology going from perfect nude images on screen then becoming sex dolls. About an hour long. Not really that interesting.,1424044800,,177,4.741935483870968

8172264,3,B000MTDRFO,"I found this film to be pretty interesting, although it is a budget production. The first half of the documentary focuses on digital artistry, creating the perfect girl with 3d computer graphics. They touch on virtual vixens in video games and the phenomenon of virtual pop idols in japan. In this part they have a bunch of short interviews and philosophical meanderings of the mind. The conversations have a hint of the whole 90's virtual reality movement. Then the film goes on to discuss advanced sex-toys and silicon love dolls. They also talk about art dolls like super dollfie. Much of this second part is in japanese and sub-titled. Some interesting footage, but not for everyone. All in all, not a bad film considering the subject matter (and the fact that there aren't too many other documentaries that touch on the topic). It is on the short side, just a little over an hour, but an interesting watch nevertheless.",1192233600,10,924,4.817610062893082
