8507873,4,B000HEKOE6,"very interesting contrast between initial months after the fall of the wall in 1989 (and reunification in 1990).  sharp sardonic interactions between young and older folks in communist/russian ruled east germany and the westernized democracy of west germany.  a good effort at showing shades of gray. the humor is times bracing.  the translations are fairly accurate, although for fluent and native german speakers, the actual exchanges are hilarious.  enjoyable and for my wife - a native german who was an adult during the fall of the wall in berlin - memorable.  a perspective too often unseen in the US.  a bit more sardonic than ""Goodbye, Lenin"" but a very nice addition to contemporary collections.",1528588800,,704,5.131578947368421
8507874,4,B000HEKOE6,"Jon Hamm is a wealth real estate developer after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In a rain storm he runs out of petrol and has to request assistance from a tough-talking Claudia Schiffer who runs a farm in 'backwoods' former East German and loved the former life of Socialism. OF COURSE he immediately likes her. he courts her with gifts and then suggests they turn the farm into a country retreat, 'course they'll have to get married and all.

Made in 1991 this may have actually been how it was but it seems too easy for them to get together.  Sub-titled. If Coca~Cola was mentioned I did not hear it, I think it was associated with Capitalism.",1527292800,,643,4.440677966101695
