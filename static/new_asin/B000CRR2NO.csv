8101233,5,B000CRR2NO,"Seriously... why couldn't the entire series have been as good as this final volume? While this statement starts to veer into speculation territory again, I can't help but think that if this series had just trashed all of the stupid filler episodes (did we really need that many episodes about Miharu's obsession with phallic shaped foods?) and shortened it to one season, this could have gone down as a great harem series that I would have gladly recommended to anyone. Instead though, we have a brilliant closing volume that audiences had to wait far too long to see. While there were more than a few times when I wanted to give up on this series, these final episodes make me glad that I didn't. Action, tears, drama, heart break, comedy... everything that you want is here. There are plenty of times when this series is going to test your patience but seeing the series closed out so neatly and in a sweet fashion... almost makes it worth it.
