8036511,3,B00061QIXQ,"This is a fair collection depending on what you are looking for. These film are all low grade cheese. The film ""Bloodspell"" could have been made for TV. The other two films contain sex, nudity, and swearing in typical 80s horror fashion. The acting and plots were substandard and not for the serious viewer.

All the films are on one disc which also contains extras such as bloopers and deleted scenes from ""Drawing Blood"" and the normal Troma nonsense. The beginning of the DVD forces you to watch the same opening in all Troma films. It doesn't allow you to skip, jump, fast forward or go to menu.",1414886400,,599,4.546296296296297
8036512,5,B00061QIXQ,"Well... Drawing Blood and Alien Blood both were just absolutely terrible in every way. But, Bloodspell was pretty great. It's why I'm giving it a high rating. Bloodspell story is about a bunch of kids in a halfway house.  A new boy comes in the house with the ability to do creepy stuff with his mind. It's like the boy version of Carie, sort of. I really liked it. If you're a Troma fan you might really like it...",1408924800,,415,4.253164556962025
8036513,1,B00061QIXQ,"I'm a sucker for those cheap multi-movie packs of rare/obscure films(in this case horror films) that are so readily available now.  I always think there might be a hidden gem somewhere among the ones that deserve obscurity.  Unfortunately, i was suckered by this one big-time.  ALL 3 films are terrible.  Audio problems occure on two of the films, the gore/nudity/scare/interest factor was low on all 3 films.  The extras are barely worth accessing once.  I would review these 3 films individually, but that would waste more time that i already spent watching them.  Since there are so many multi-packs and obscure films to pick from, i can honestly recommend you cross this one off your list and pick from something else.",1125014400,4,722,4.917355371900826
