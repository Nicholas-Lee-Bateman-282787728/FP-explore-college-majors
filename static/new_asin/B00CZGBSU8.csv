8587929,3,B00CZGBSU8,"Two sisters dream of owning their own funeral parlor complete with cemetery attached! But these aren't your typical sisters, no.. these ladies will do whatever it takes to make this dream a reality even if that means murder! After setting themselves up on a dating service the two marry several times to unsuspecting men. One is even killed on the way home from the chapel. Not suspicions at all... right? Once the sinister sisters collect on the life insurance policies they become closer to their goal of purchasing their dream funeral home. In one incident an odd aunt is targeted after seeing a dead body. The sisters simply say ""Maybe she left her favorite niece a little something.""

This film was made in 1988 and is now available to own for the first time so if you're into rarities this is certainly a must! This edition has some interesting bonus features and comes in a limited purple case while supplies last.",1376956800,3,921,4.720496894409938
