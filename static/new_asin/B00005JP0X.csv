All aside i know this movie and The Protector were going against each other coming out around the same times, I will give some pros and cons....

If anyone is a Jet Li fan they owe it to him to see this movie one..... two the movie is great nice fight scenes and a really good storyline, music also blended in good with the movie.

Aside from that I know its telling its tale but there is a lotta talking and when people were just about fed up and wanting to walk out, you have to be patient to watch this movie.

Im sorry but I would Profer The Protector Over Jet Li's new movie, don't get me wrong im a big fan but the long pauses over the secnes of fighting and talking were too long.

Again its telling its tale , but any fan of Martial Arts should love this movie.

I would say its a good flick to catch and im sure everyone who saw it would agree.

1611958,4,B00005JP0X,"Well, let me begin by saying that Fearless is Jet Li's most emotional movie. And while Jet Li is not going to get an Oscar for his acting, I thought he did a very convincing job both as a rash young man and a wiser wushu master.

It is one of Jet Li's stronger movies. Perhaps overall, his best. The plot is engaging throughout, the acting was satisfying and the fight sequences are exciting.

I have two big disappointments with the movie:

1. Jet Li's progression from being an arrogant young man to a humble master was absolutely horribly developed. I did not missed Michelle Yeoh one bit, but I missed the Thai fighter sequence that was cut out because that probably was a lesson for him that helped change him. Basically Jet Li just ended up in a village and there was a couple dialogues between him and Betty Sun and suddenly he decided to leave and head for Shanghai. Not at all satisfying.

2. The fight scenes was a bit disappointing for me early on. While there are quite a bit of wirework, the main problem is that they use WAY too much computer effects. I mean, is it necessary for them to slow mo every single flip and leap and speed it back up like The Matrix? Was it necessary for them to pull the actors back twenty feet every time they received a punch from Jet? This is Huo Yuan Jia, not Juggernaut. Plus, for those of you that is anticipating the fight scenes between Jet and the British, German and Spanish fighters, you will be disappointed because each fight is like a minute long, not really anything special.

Here is what didn't disappoint:

1. Jet Li vs. Nathan Jones

Fantastic fight. Quite a few wirework, but it didn't distract from the fight at all. The most watchable fight by Jet Li in years. What I like about it is that the fact that Wo Ping did not forget that Jones is a wrestler and he put that aspect of his martial arts to the screen wonderfully. Jet Li got thrown like a rock, squashed like a bug, and lifted like a doll. To see Jet Li counter Jones was a thing to watch!

2. Jet Li vs. Shidou Nakamura

WOW. The best weapons fight Jet Li ever done. Period. The entire sequence was exciting, fresh and full of character. My favorite scene in the movie is when they accidently switch weapons and Jet Li and Shidou stopped the fight and exchanged their weapons back. Brilliant scene for both characters.

3. The ending. Preachy, but emotional. I like it.

Overall, one of Jet Li's stronger film. Perhaps his best since the Once Upon a Time in China despite the short comings.

I can't wait to watch the uncut version.

1611959,5,B00005JP0X,"we saw this in singapore during our summer holidays. man, just the martial arts tournament alone kept you spellbound. of course, jet li is in his finest form.  this movie truly speak about the real meaning of martial arts - peace within oneself in the truest form.",1157587200,,264,4.617021276595745
1611960,5,B00005JP0X,"[The following review refers to the 104 minute version of `Fearless' released in Japan in March, 2006, starring Jet Li.]

`Fearless"" is inspired by the life of Huo Yuan Jia, real-life Chinese martial arts master. Jet Li plays this legendary figure, whose martial arts style and fearless fight helped the people in China regain their pride in the early 20th century when China was intimidated and humiliated by the growing Western and Japanese powers.

Well, so much for the history. Now, let's talk about actions. In `Fearless' Jet Li has shown his best performance since the days he did `Once Upon A Time In China' playing the role of Wong Fei Hung, another legendary hero in China, and the fight scenes (choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping) are all fantastic, sometimes visceral, and sometimes graceful, and always powerful. Good and smooth editing and gorgeous production designs also help greatly to create the background.

[JET LI'S PHILOSOPHY] After the opening martial arts competition sequences in Shanghai, 1910, the film begins to follow the life of Huo Yuan Jia from the days he was a boy in a flashback section. Jet Li and director Ronny Yu (yes, the guy who did `Bride of Chucky' and `Freddy vs. Jason') made a wise decision in showing Collin Chou as Father of young Huo Yuan Jia because the image of charismatic Chou (previously seen in two `Matrix' sequels as body guard Seraph) as the stern father who forbids his son to fight well-represents Li's philosophy about martial arts.

Yes, `Fearless' is a first-rate martial arts action film, but the film is more than that. The film, which was released under the title of `Spirit' in Japan, has Li's message about martial arts, which impresses without being obtrusive.

Besides splendid Collin Chou, the film has assembled interesting names from in and outside of Asia: Nathan Jones as `Hercules' one of Huo Yuan Jia's opponents: Anthony De Longis as Spanish fighter: Brandon Rhea as German fighter: Masato Harada (seen in `The Last Samurai') as Mr. Mita. Debuting actress Sun Li (Betty Li) is impressive as a blind girl, and so is Dong Yong who steals the show as Huo Yuan Jia's old friend. But probably to the Western viewers the real find is the Japanese rising star Shidou Nakamura as Anno Tanaka samurai fighter. Nakamura, who will be seen Clint Eastwood's `Red Sun, Black Sand,' is already known as a talented actor in Japan, and he shows it with the brilliant fight scenes.

But the film is of course a Jet Li film, with the genuine actions that no one but he can do, and Li also succeeds in bringing life and dignity into the character of Huo Yuan Jia. As you know, it is said that `Fearless' will be the last martial arts film for Jet Li. I don't know if it is really true, but I know this is his best film in years.",1146528000,105,2782,4.690573770491803

1612118,5,B00005JP0X,"This is a movie with incredible heart. This is not a balletic fight scene movie with fantastical subject matter and flying. Let me say, I like those very much and it would be quite hard to oust Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon from my all time favorite spot, would have been if it were not for this perfect movie. This movie has moved above all martial arts movies I have ever seen, all movies I have ever seen. It moved me and changed my outlook on styles of martial arts, forever. I cannot get it out of my mind because this was a movie with incredible humanity.

Huo Yuanjias journey from arrogance to humility moved me deeply. Jet Li's acting was fine acting, it was so deeply moving. It was perfect how the movie came full circle. He learned a truly deep lesson from his father that it seemed at the beginning he would not, could not learn.

Some of the movies scenes are dark, very dark and I wept a great deal throughout the second half of the movie. It was a little difficult to take and made me feel a little beat up myself, but then I was lifted by Jet Li's beautiful ending spirit sequence, tears again, but the good kind, just beautiful.

The fight scenes are crazy good, they are not light weight, but hardcore scenes with techniques that are familiar, but I never saw them performed so well. I am in awe of Jet Lis martial arts, he is a true master. I swear at some point I could see Qi flowing out of his fingertips.

- Jet Li.  His style is pure and it is undeniably Chinese
- Fight scenes that dare you to blink.  They are beautiful and original choreographed fight scenes.
- Story:  A good story that moves.  Lot's of fight scenes, which, to be honest, is what we buy these movies for.

What I didn't like:
- Characterization of the ""American"" fighter.  I really hate when anyone makes one culture a ridiculous stereotype and they did that with the ""white guy"".  Uncool.
- The story.  Yes, I did say that was one of things I liked.  But it's one of things I also didn't like as the story was built around the fight scenes (as many as they could get in).

1612180,5,B00005JP0X,"It's amazing I don't watch more Asian films such as this one.  The culture of many places in Asia is downright fascinating to me.  It feels good to absorb the culture in these types of films and more importantly to take a break from all the Hollywood stuff we see most of the time which gets boring after a while.  This is about Jet Li's character being an expertise in martial arts in China during the early 1900's, and nobody in the town of Tianjin can defeat him.  He's significantly better than the other fighters, and it even gets to the point he has to fight numerous people at once to even the odds since nobody can defeat him one on one.  Truly a warrior of the ring!

However without spoiling too much, eventually Jet gets a big head and thinks he's unstoppable.  This leads to overconfidence and the assumption he can beat anyone.  He takes on a challenge that turns out to be costly and not because of the fight in the ring either, which results in Jet leaving the city completely and living in the peaceful breezy country for a while where he meets a blind woman he becomes temporarily attached to.  Eventually however, he returns to Tianjin, reclaims the friendships he lost, and returns to the ring to continue fighting.

My favorite part is the fight he has with a huge American guy at least 5 times bigger than him!  This means Jet has to change his strategy and find a way to take the big man down.  Not sure if any of this is based on a true story, but this fight in particular was really exciting to watch.  Otherwise the other fights that take place both before and after involve a LOT of fast-moving hand, sword and nunchuck-swinging combat.  How about that one triple nunchuck scene!  And the intense sword fight earlier before he left town?  It was probably a dishonorable fight given Jet's overconfidence taking over common sense at the time, but it was amazing to watch on screen.

I didn't care for the ending.  Again not sure if any of this is based on facts, but wow, what a lousy outcome for our hero.  However as is probably tradition in China, it was great to see Jet eventually realize the errors of his ways before it was too late.  For him to develop a newfound appreciation for his life and an appreciation for others through experience with the people he met in the country and learn/understand the meaning of life was truly a great thing to witness.

Overall expect lots of fighting, reading subtitles on the bottom of the screen,  a compelling story strong enough to lure in the viewers, fantastic acting and a great movie overall.  Think I'll watch more movies like this one in the future.  Fearless was good enough to bring back the spark I once had for martial arts films back in the 80's.",1433462400,,2730,4.468686868686869

So, I did just that. After sending an email to UNIVERSAL STUDIOS about the disc problem, I received a response from them within a day or so and they requested my mailing address so they could send me the DIRECTOR'S CUT of the DVD. After doing so, I received the disc within a few days.

As a result, I was finally able to view the DIRECTOR'S CUT of the film and I was very happy about that.",1421712000,4,995,4.226315789473684

Fearless is not just about martial arts. It's a movie than can teach you about respecting your fellow human being. We all have enemies, that is inevitable throughout life but knowing how to approach your enemy and control your deepest anger (whatever that may be) toward that person, that is an entirely different fight than the physical fight you may face against him.

1612357,5,B00005JP0X,"I was fortunate enough to recently see the more rare Director's Cut of Fearless in addition to the theatrical cut. Many people reviewing this film seem to have issues with the discrepancies between the two versions (about 40 minutes of footage lost). The Director's Cut  certainly tells a more full and in depth story, but it is also significantly longer.

Jet Li's character of Huo Yuanjia begins his journey as a selfish, arrogant, Wushu master (Li's martial art specialty) that is determined to be the very best. There has been harsh criticism about the way Huo is portrayed in the film. So much so that the actual grandson of Huo Yuanjia filed a lawsuit against Jet Li and the film's production company for inaccurately portraying Yuanjia.

The film is incredibly well made, with great cinematography, fantastic fight scenes and a compelling story with complex characters. The scenery and imagery of rural China is so beautifully shot and portrayed in Fearless. The added time in the Director's Cut really gives the film more of an epic feel (though I could have done without the olympic intro and exit). Nothing is rushed, and some things that may seem insignificant end up adding more to the story and character development.

The film ends on a resonant note, completing Huo Yuanjia's story and showing the lasting impact of his legacy.",1400371200,3,1342,4.924778761061947

1612383,5,B00005JP0X,"Fearless is based on the true story of martial arts legend, Huo Yuanjia, who reputedly defeated a Russian wrestler and an Irish boxer during a time when China was known as ""the sick old man of Asia"", thereby, restoring pride to the Chinese people and nation and transforming him into a much revered legend in the history of martial arts. The movie features Jet Li in what is probably the greatest martial arts movie ever made, showcasing the master at the peak of his prowess in a film that also embodies his martial arts philosophy.

The movie begins with Huo Yuanjia secretly watching his father practicing martial arts by performing the traditional kung fu moves culminating with a blow of his hand to a slab of hard concrete slab and Huo, after his father has left the practice arena, touching the stone slab and discovering that it has shattered in two, showcasing the phenomenal feats of kung fu demonstrated by his father.

The story, then progresses into Huo witnessing his father engaging in a duel with a formidable opponent, who could barely match his skill, only to hold back, in an act of restrain, because he didn't want to incurred severe damage to his opponent and, as a result, spurring the opponent to take advantage of the situation by dealing Huo's father the defeating blow.

Dissatisfied with this, Huo challenged the opponent's son to a match which finds him badly defeated due to his lack of kung fu training, spurring him to secretly obtain his father's instruction manual and secretly practicing kung fu, while vowing to take revenge on his father's opponent's son (which he successfully accomplishes), and vowing to be the greatest martial arts practitioner in China and, subsequently, challenging every single opponent in the People Republic and emerging as the undefeated champion with the exception of the one most formidable opponent who he later kills in a match in retaliation for the wounding of one of his disciples by the opponent's disciple.

However, one of his opponent's disciple slaughters Huo's entire family and, incites Huo to seek revenge on his opponent's family only to find himself holding back with empathy for his opponent's grieving family members.

Resultant of this, Huo loses all interest in life and attempts to commit suicide, only to be rescued by the inhabitants of a small Chinese village; the inhabitants of whom slowly nourishes him back to health and, finds Huo maturing and reaching an epiphany that constitutes a change of philosophy from him seeking to be the best martial arts practitioner in China to embracing a philosophy that wushu should only be meant as a form of competitive sport and, as such, finding him challenging the best martial arts practitioners throughout the world; including a champion wrestler from the United States as well as engaging in a tournament against four martial arts practitioner, comprising, among others, of a fencing champion and the best from Japan in a fixed competition that was designed to make him lose.

However, Huo emerges the undisputed winner in all matches, resultant of which he is poisoned by the Japanese who had betted on his defeated, resulting in Huo losing the match despite overwhelming support from the crowd, until the last move where he manages to deal a blow to his opponent which, if he had not held back, would have proven fatal. Then, before Huo finally collapses in demise, his Japanese opponent, realizing that he had, in default been defeated, raises Huo's hand in saluting of his spirit and win with uproars applause and cheering from the crowd, transforming Huo into a legendary hero who had restored pride to the Chinese people who had been humiliated by foreign aggressors who had declared China the sick old man of Asia.

Fearless constitutes the greatest martial arts film ever made with extraordinarily well choreographed fight sequences as well as incorporating one of the best story lines ever encapsulated in a martial arts film.

If anyone recalls ""Fist of Fury,"" Bruce Lee avenges his unbeatable master who was poisoned by the Japanese.  In Jet Li's Fearless, the story starts at the beginning with the life story of the unbeatable master, brilliantly portrayed and acted by Jet Li.
I saw both the theatrical and the unrated versions of this production, and I must say that the unrated version was more fulfilling. This version contains a 25 minute or so long story that allows the viewer to see the process of change in his character, and finally, his redemption before he returns to Shanghai and begins to bout again in the ring. The end is sad, but it is based on true events.

However and finally, the chosen one was Jet Li who finally decided to portray and to re-enact that famous man's Martial Experts and Fighting Skills, and as well as his compassion for the Worlds' competitors as only his sparing partners to see his own ideology of compassion to be passed on without killing in this breathtaking and monumental production!
This feature was indeed one of the best that I had seen since the last time I watched a Bruce Lee movie.

Mind you, the Ideas of Bruce Lee's ""Jeet Kun Do"" (The Way of the Intercepting Fist Technique), which Lee developed
by himself is the basic and fundamental fighting style that is now being taught al over in China's Martial Arts Schools.  Jet Li has become one of the most proficient and an expert of Bruce Lee's style at his early age of 12

Fearless with Jet Li was made by the same producers of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which is one of my all time favorite martial arts movie.

The story in Fearless was inspired by a real-life hero.  There are numerous fantastic action scenes in this film, which includes unarmed and weapon combat fighting.  However, the story is also very meaningful as Jet Li finally realizes the truth his late father, who was a Wu Shu master, had taught him about fighting. This movie is about an obsession to be the number one best fighter in China, only to discover that his obsession destroyed his life.  In the end he finally discovers the real philosophy of living a meaningful life.

In conclusion, if you like a well crafted story combined with some great Asian martial arts action, you will like this film.

1612466,5,B00005JP0X,"When this film came out, it was advertised and billed as Jet Li's ""final martial arts epic"".  As a Jet Li fan, this both exhilirated and saddened me of course.  I am happy to say that Jet Li definitely goes out with a bang and did not disappoint this fan.  This film certainly satisfied me gave me closure on a remarkable actor's career.

""Fearless"", or ""Huo Yuanjia"" in Chinese tells the story of the eponomynous martial arts master.  Although Huo was a real person and this film is widely criticised for being wildly historically inaccurate, I'm of the opinion that films are primarily made to entertain and I aim only to judge a film on the merits of its entertainment value.  By that metric, I was wildly entertained.  If you want a history lesson, go read a biography of Huo Yuanjia.

I will attempt to be vague to not ruin the story.  However, the core of the story told in three acts, and follows roughly the rise, fall, and rebirth of the main character as a martial arts master.  Huo in the first act is arrogant, ill-tempered, vengeful, and always has a chip on his shoulder.  Tragedy strikes as a result of his arrogance, and in the 2nd act he is forced rediscover who he is and find redemption.  The 3rd act deals with his rebirth and legacy.  Although martial arts movies about tragedy and redemption are a dime a dozen (particularly if you go to Hong Kong), ""Fearless"" somehow makes it feel fresh and powerful again, and Huo/Jet's character's arc is handled with much skill.

The cinematography of the film is absolutely gorgeous.  The film looks STUNNING on Blu-ray and is definitely blu-ray worthy, one of the best-looking high-def films in my library.  My guests were very impressed with the picture and sound quality on my Samsung home theater setup.  Fearless also has some of the most spectacular and gorgeous fight-scenes this side of Ip Man.  The crowning glory of the entire film is perhaps the epic fight between Huo Yuanjia and Master Qin in the restaurant/bar.  The only word I could think of that does justice in describing the fight is ""apocalyptic"".

The final part of the movie that completes the character's development was especially beautiful, deep, and poignant, and I actually didn't understand it the first time.  (SPOILER:  When dueling the Japanese master Tanaka, Huo/Jet uses the same move that he used earlier to kill master Qin, and you see clearly that Huo's fist gets through Tanaka's defences.  However, unlike in the fight with master Qin, he pulls back and does NOT deliver the death blow.  Jet Li looks into Tanaka's eyes and lets him know that ""I got you, I could have given the death blow, but I choose to pull back.  That is the true meaning of being a master, knowing restraint"".  Thus Tanaka admits defeat even as Huo falls to the ground poisoned).

The only thing I did NOT like about the movie (and the reason I would give it only 4.5 stars if Amazon did half-stars) is that in the extended director's cut edition, the 2nd act really is too long now, and really weighed the movie.  I felt that it dragged on and sacrificed too much pacing in favour of fleshing out character development, and I found myself mildly bored during the middle of the film.  However, overall this is a martial arts classic and definitely one of Jet Li's best.",1339113600,,3290,4.633851468048359

What impressed me most was my range of emotions in watching Jet Li's experience -- cheering him on to whip his opponents, and crying at the very sad ending. Jet Li, to me, is a good actor. He can perform acrobatics, he's graceful, but I loved how he smiled at his opponents. He was compassionate. The movie direction was suberb, as is the art direction.

1612507,1,B00005JP0X,"I'm not adding to the smorgasbord of information (either technical, aerial, nor compositional) that many reviewers haven't already said about this very popular and well-done film. I mean Jet Li's movies mean business. He knows about sure things. He knows, for example, that he is no ladies man. No one wants to see him bare chested. Unlike many films, to their credit or detriment love scenes are necessary to give the hero something to live for or a reward. His movies eschew love scenes because it takes away from the broader need for the audience to marvel at the speed, dexterity, confidence and dedication to display what a body and mind in it's synergy can become. A beautiful and unassuming weapon of pain.

I'm here for the first time as a buyer, to exercise the right of a reviewer. First, I want to say that I experienced no problems with this seller. He delivered early. Just what I like in a seller and this reviewer realizes that what is claimed on the packaging but not found on the discs is not something that the seller can do anything about. As a seller is obligated to deliver accordingly the disc in the methods he outlined at the point of sale. Titan Liquidation has done that admirably.

However, the studio and/or distributor has never seen my angry side. They wouldn't like me when I'm angry. The studio's first blunder is in the numbers of versions. Three versions stated on the packaging is not what was found to be the contents of the set. This is a 2-disc set containing an unrated and theatrical cut on both discs. Both discs have the same extras. Both discs' theatrical cuts are rated PG13. The more widely available UR, WS Edition with an extra scene of Jet coming to be punished for the village boy's thievery of another village's cow is not included either. The studio's second problem is regional catering of releases. There is an UK, PRC, ROC, Thailand, Japan, HK, and a US release that I counted. So many regional releases just to see a few excised scenes??? So, when I buy one. It isn't the one. Then I buy two and it isn't two. I must buy a third one to see the film in its entirety. Never mind that the studios are playing favorites here with the Blu-ray disc said to contain all three versions. What about a regular dvd is not good enough? Nothing. I got this movie for a rock-bottom price but for purists who want to see all of the fabled scenes of Michelle Yeoh and the kickboxing match along with about 35 minutes of other scenes in an otherwise near flawless movie, try the HK, R3 version but otherwise, stick with this. It will still raise your blood pressure and make you do foolish things should any of the armchair wushu artists in all of us would want to try anything fanciful. I'd recommend the restaurant fight where Jet hangs by his foot on the rafters to gouge Master Chin's head with his sword. But good luck explaining to your parents your reasons.",1306195200,4,2902,4.525714285714286
1612508,5,B00005JP0X,"This is an amazing movie, but with the Blu-Ray Directors Cut you can finally see how the movie was intended (sounds much better as well).  I would give the US DVD version a 7/10 just for the fighting alone.  The story was a bit muted, but since they made such a big deal about this being Jet's last fight film I thought they really did a great job.

However, having seen the full movie that was intended...I would say this movie is now a solid 9/10.  Much deeper story and characters.  They cut nearly 30 mins of plot from the movie.  His time with Moon and the villagers were the primary cut points.  Li even comments in the interviews that this movie is intended to show the full circle that a martial artist of his caliber typically goes through...Fighting skill is only half of the story.

1612551,3,B00005JP0X,"After Jet Li left the ""Once upon of time in China"" series, it's probably one of his better films.  In most of this story, it only requires him playing a one-dimensional character, and it helps the film moving more smoothly. The key of any successful Jet Li's films is NOT to expose the fact that he's really a poor actor!  Jet can't act.  Period.  He's a limited set of fixed *faces* that he sort of rotates around in his films.  He's shown some very minor improvement after spending 20 years of doing this, but it's very small and almost childish comparing to some real actors from Asia, i.e. Chow Yat Fat, Tony Leung (both of them) and the matured Andy Lau.  Back to this film, it has great action scenes, but not sure if it's a lot better than his ""Once upon"" series.  The most annoying part of me personally is the part of the transfomation, where he's supposed to *change* from a selfish man to a true master of zen (and/or simply more humble man).  It doesn't work.  The ending somehow just seems rushed and unfulfilling.  I watch the regular version, and have heard that the director cut version has more minutes for the change.

It's good to know that there's the Unrated version, which is about three minutes longer than the theatrical version to watch, which to me is a lot less boring.  I liked how they added the intro with Michelle Yeoh in the DC though.

1612553,3,B00005JP0X,"Jet Li's Fearless (Huo Yuan Jia) : 6 out of 10: This movie is a true near miss. For most of its running time it is action packed with handsome photography and gritty realistic fight scenes. To bad a too predictable by half story and Jet Li's performance hold it back from greatness.

What the move does right however it does very well indeed. The fight scenes are extremely well choreographed and differ in tone and skill from each other. Except for the final fight they are all very satisfying. They range from an acrophobic set piece early on above a busy city square to a humorous match between Li and a boxer that reminds one of Rocky's fight against Hulk Hogan in Rocky 3.

There is no obvious wire work or CGI involved this is the real deal. Had the movie stuck with it's strengths it would have been much better off.

Unfortunately halfway through the film Jet Li's character (A loosely interpreted version of a real historical Chinese patriot) decides to forgo fighting for a life in an idyllic rice patty. Like the picture perfect Japanese village in the Last Samurai the rice patty is an idolized place with supermodel blind girls and hobbits. (Okay I made the hobbits part up; but try to watch those scenes and not think of Middle Earth.)

Jet Li's acting in the transformation scenes is wanting and his costars (especially best friend Dong Yong) steal every scene they are in. It is hard to get emotionally connected with the character (Who goes from brash youth to wise old man after a couple of rice plantings with little transformation and no gray area or shadings of personality. Both characterizations are extremely broad and simply seem two different people.)

This leads to a surprisingly sterile finale. I simply couldn't care about the character or his cause. Though the story is more fleshed out than say in Hero the character is simply to broad to identify with as an individual. That said I did love the fight scenes.",1268179200,,1941,4.647230320699708

Years of training enable him to ace match after match in his home region of Tianjin. But as his fame as a martial arts master grows, so does his pride. After an ill-advised fight leads to another master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to apply what he has learned. Returning to Tianjin, Huo takes steps to come to terms with his past and restore his family's name. His evolving, graceful Mizong (Missing) Fist method of fighting brings Huo renewed success, and he forms the progressive Jingwu Sports Federation. Taking note, duplicitous members of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce engineer a Shanghai tournament pitting Huo against four fighters, each representing the major foreign powers in China. Huo commits to the bout and faces off against, respectively, a British boxer, a Spanish swordsman, a Belgian soldier and a Japanese martial artist. What happened that day in 1910 has never been, and will never be, forgotten in China.

1612577,4,B00005JP0X,"What can one accomplish in 42 years of life?  Fearless gives an answer to that question. The film is based on the life of Huo Yuanjia, a national sports hero of old China.

From a young age, Huo watched as his father trained students.  His dream was to become like his father, a master fighter.  Eventually, he became an excellent stage fighter.

Jet Li gives a moving performance as Huo Yuanjia.  On top of his game he makes one tragic decision which leads to fatal consequences for his family.  He delivers on a man who loses everything that he loves and falls into the depths of despair.

Wandering aimlessly, Huo finds himself rescued and nursed back to health.  A blind girl teaches him the true meaning of life.  The scene in the rice paddies is one of the most inspirational parts of this film. From the pit of despair he rises like the phoenix to become the man which Chinese history remembers.

Destiny and fate take over as the course of events lead to the ultimate showdown with four fighters-three Westerners and Japan's national champion.  The pride of China is at stake. The ending is truly unexpected but believable.

The marital arts sequences are well choreographed.  They are very realistic in comparison to other recent films-no tree dancing in this film.

This film delivers a beautiful tapestry.  The action sequences, the scenery and the music make this Chinese composition a graceful work of artistry.

I love(In LOVE with)Jet Li, he is a master of SEVERAL Wushu Martial Arts, A.K.A Li Lianjie known for movies such as Shaolin Temple, Black Mask, Once Upon A Time in China,Romeo Must Die with Aaliyah(may she rest in peace) Fist of Legend, Unleashed and many more I love and have watched more then 4 times a piece,
Well anywhoo... This is a Biopic, the person he is so wondrously portraying was the real person, Huo Yuanjia ,WHICH with out him we would have no idea of what Martial Arts are.  At first he seems an unlikeable character then.. because some of the opening storyline scenes But, stuff happens, then some very touching and exciting stuff plus funny and endearing things happen during this, And not to mention the fight scenes in between all these and then a storyline that is poignant and wisdom filled.
All this makes for a very well made movie. (I will digress real quick and tell you In ""Fist of Legend"" He plays one of the students he trained. Get this movie too)
But then after all that, and which was close to the end of the movie I cried. I mean more then 1 (one) tissue cried.

1612616,5,B00005JP0X,"First, as is seen from the box, you get all three versions that were released.  I never saw the film in the theater, but I had read that the one to watch was the director's cut.  I actually rented the film, but it was SO good I just had to get it anyway (bought it used).  A short video of how the film was made is the only extra on the disk though.  Actually, I wanted to mention there is this cool quasi-screensaver that just has the ""Universal"" studio logo if you pause the film and walk away from your blu ray player for a while.  I watched the ""directors cut"" first, then looked at the original theatrical release-it's amazing how much of the original film was gutted, so it's easy to understand why fans are angry about the original release.

Assuming you watch the director's cut, the time line and events flow nicely with Huo Yuan Jia, and this is not just a kung fu film.  I really enjoyed the range of acting that Jet Li did-he clearly is positioning himself as something other than doing just pure action films for the future.  Granted, he's in his mid-40's and is, like Jackie Chan, getting into the twilight years of what he is originally known for-kung fu.  As Huo Yuan Jia, Jet Li did an excellent job of showing someone who was basically obsessed with fighting and to beat opponents at any cost, personal or otherwise.  After he casts himself out of his village upon murdering his rival, he is basically reborn and learns that not always fighting is part of Wushu, which ultimately completes his training.  He then returns to his village, starts the Wushu organization and fights various challengers from foreign countries in order to help get his Wushu organization off the ground.

I don't want to give away too many special items, but Yuen Woo Ping's ""wire-fu"" is obvious, but it looks good when used.  Near the end of the film Huo Yuan Jia is fighting a legendary Japanese swordsman and they switch weapons (kind of by accident) and they both realize they need to switch their weapons back, without saying a word.  This film has a great deal of intelligence that went into it.  Jet Li became a Buddhist, and has indicated that this is his last Wushu film, but he did his Monkey King role in The Forbidden Kingdom, so he Jet Li is not completely quitting the kung fu scene.

If you are a Jet Li fan, this is as good as Fist Of Legend, but I personally think it's his best film in his entire career (up to this point).",1250294400,,2436,4.416107382550336

1612618,5,B00005JP0X,great finish to jet li's martial arts epics. i thought it was a great movie from start to finish.,1245801600,,97,4.157894736842105
1612619,5,B00005JP0X,"I watched the theatre version, wich I think is this one. first of all, I grew up in China and loved Kung fu movies, thus I had my fair share of Chinese and American versions of ""kung fu"".

This movie tells a true historic story, it is slightly fleshed out but I couldn't pick out any obvious flaws.

This is real kung fu. Jet Li is a skilled martial artist turned actor. This films contain physical combat, no flying around on a wire. This is real kung fu, at least 98% of it.

I don't write reviews for movies, but I have to for this one.

strongly recommend it! This movie tells a meaningful story AND shows fantastic REAL kung fu. What else could you ask for?",1244678400,,662,4.188976377952756
1612620,5,B00005JP0X,"...and I don't mean just favorite martial arts pic either. Also, please note that I'm writing about the full Director's Cut; I've never seen the other versions. And I had no problem with bad disks, so that issue's probably been taken care of by the manufacturer.

Briefly, 'Fearless' is about the son of a Wushu master (Jet Li) who becomes a famous master himself. However, he's a shallow man and his interest in wushu is based solely on arrogance. This leads to his downfall just as he achieves the pinnacle of success. With his life destroyed and only an empty shell of a person, he wanders aimlessly and almost dies until he slowly discovers the spirit that is supposed to go along with martial arts. He rebuilds himself, without any of the pat 'moments of truth' you'd find in most movies. As he finds a real sense of self and purpose, he returns home to reclaim his life and make amends.

'Fearless' doesn't scrimp on fight scenes, yet it also tells a very deep and moving story. Ronny Yu makes the film so epic and yet it is so simple, almost like an ancient parable you'd read about some Zen master. Much of the reason the movie is so powerful is that the script allows the story to unfold rather than letting dialogue tell us what to think. Also, importantly, Li does a fantastic job conveying the various stages of his character's journey through expressions, delivery, and body language. You can realy tell the difference in the character from the beginning of the movie to the end. As far as I'm concerned, that's what great acting is all about.

The Director's Cut makes this a long movie, but I never felt at any time that 'Fearless' had unnecessary scenes or dragged. If anything, I think the shorter versions must be lacking key scenes or subplots whose absence would lessen this very rich movie. As a result, I would not be at all interested in seeing the shorter versions. Some of the other reviews here seem to confirm my suspicion.

'Fearless' speaks to me in so many different ways: the importance of friendship, the importance of wisdom versus knowledge, what real success is all about, and what it is to be a man. For those reasons, as well as the sheer beauty of the film, the great story, and the terrific fight scenes, this is my favorite movie of all time.",1241913600,2,2282,4.558536585365854

I only wish they would have spent more time on his training when he was a young boy, I thought an added 5 minutes or so here would have been time well spent in character development.  The views of China's landscape are breathtaking and a peak into early 20th century life in an ever changing China was also very intriguing.  All in all, a wonderful film, something that has depth and grace.",1236124800,,548,4.44
1612658,5,B00005JP0X,"Its ashame how I watch people give classics one stars and corny movies 4 stars. Anyone who gives this movie a 1 star or even a 2 or 3 star is just nit picky or doesnt understand kung fu films. This movie is by far the greatest kung fu movie of all time(tied with Last Hurrah for Chivalry until proved otherwise).

In this movie Jet Li plays as the infamous Huo Yuan Jia. In real life his father wouldnt allow him to learn kung fu like his brothers because of a sickness. The movie doesnt demonstrate this part. But in real life and in the movie he comes to be the best martial artist in the country.

I mean I can sit here and tell you the story but I really think you should just buy it. I mean the fights are incredible, the storyline is incredible, and it really touches your heart as well.

This movie just has it all. The total package. Excellent cast of fighters and its just one of the best. Theres nothing more I can tell you. If you don't have it then do yourself a favor and buy it. You will not be disappointed. Trust me!",1235606400,,1032,4.099009900990099
1612659,2,B00005JP0X,The standard DVD is missing much of the comparision fighting that made the climax so dramatic. Without the fight sequence intact the movie fails as it was poorly edited.

1612660,4,B00005JP0X,"I first purchased this movie in Hong Kong as I'm a fairly faithful Jet Li fan.  However, I always felt that the version I saw was missing something.  It seemed as if it couldn't decide what genre it wanted to belong to.

Then I saw the director's cut on blu-ray.  It was a double whammy!  The movie as told in this version is a tale of a man who must come to terms with an unspeakable tragedy.  How he overcomes his own trials and becomes a hero to a nation.  What it is not is a ""Wi-fu"" flick.  In fact the kung fu seems to serve only one purpose:  To show the viewer the difference in fighting for selfish ends and fighting for a more noble purpose.

The picture and sound are noticeably better than the DVD release, but the greatest treasure is the story itself.  You understand his motives, his grief.  If you go in thinking Unleashed or Fists of Fury or even Crouching Tiger (not that he's in the last), you'll be disappointed.

My wife typically does not watch ""kung fu"" movies, but she sat through it.  She even asked that I pause it when she needed to get up.  A sure sign she's hooked.

The only gripe, was the very beginning with Michelle Yeoh.  I didn't think it was necessary.

As always, rent before you buy, because otherwise, you have noone to blame but yourself.",1235260800,,1278,4.298319327731092
1612661,5,B00005JP0X,"I had already owned the HD DVD version of this movie--I already thought it a masterpiece --not only in terms of Jet Li's acting and martial arts but also the quality of the cinematography and music.
The Directors Cut is just as fascinating and changes the cadence of the story, fleshing out portions of the characters;
I was surprised that the audio on the Blu Ray seemed quite surpressed
compared to the HD-DVD--and considering how stirring the Japanese penned music is, was disappointed by that;
Additionally, I was also surprised at the lack of contrast and rich colors that were present in the HD version vs Blu Ray...(of course HD lost the war, so these comments are probably superfluous!)
Anyway---if you are a fan of this movie--it is a must own, even if you have the regular DVD or HD version...the Directors Cut is well worth it;
If you have not seen it yet and enjoy a good period epic or martial arts, it is also a must own---bravo!

Not only does this disc include the theatrical and unrated versions but it also includes the director's cut. This film may have put some people off at time of release but the new director's cut is how I believe this film was meant to be seen. This director's cut is pretty much a different film and provides a lot more detail and has a much better flow to it. This blu ray is show off material as the picture and sound quality are both excellent. A must own for Jet Li fans and highly recomended for those who might be interested.,1232064000,2,705,4.1911764705882355

1612674,4,B00005JP0X,"As is the directors cut over the previous cuts. I had just recently watched the unrated cut on standard not long ago and the Blu Ray/directors cut looked and played out so differently, it was like watching a different movie altogether.

It's a shame that 'Fearless' was so overlooked in the theaters and was most likely chalked up to being ""another kung fu movie"". Nothing could be further from the truth. There's a real story here about a real martial arts champion who learns about the downfalls of arrogance, pride and revenge. But he must lose it all in order to understand what's truly important in life, to his father and his country. It's a long, hard road indeed. While it's mostly story, and a good one at that, the fight scenes are excellent as well. They lean towards the fantasy style of kung fu on wires but it's all acceptable if you'll give a little leeway. But it doesn't go nearly as far as others have with flying around and walking on water and such. Otherwise, this is an fine film that'll hold your attention, even the moreso now with the extra 35 min. on the directors cut which fleshes out the story so much more. It allows for more growth of character and context to some scenes that previously had little impact in the other versions. It reminds me of 'Kingdom of Heaven'. I didn't like it very much in it's theatrical cut, but the directors cut made so much more sense of the characters and scenes, that it made it an entirely different movie. I had the same experience here with 'Fearless"" and I'm so glad they decided to release the DC version. It makes a pretty good move into a very good movie.

The Blu Ray is also the only way to see it, and I mean ""see"" it. The standard dvd was servicable at best but compared to the Blu Ray, it's pretty bad. There are so many wonderful sets, costumes and scenery to see here that I feel like I'm also looking at a different movie. The detail is excellent and the print is spotlessly clean. The bold colors pop and everything is clearly defined. The difference is night and day. This is the only way to watch this movie.

The Blu Ray also offers DTS-HD soundtracks that are also way better than the DD 5.1 tracks on the standard disc. Theres alot more bass from the action and percussion. The quite scenes are loaded with discrete ambient noise and there's never a problem discerning the voices over the sounds and music. One thing of note though, only a Mandarin DTS-HD track can be found on the Directors Cut. Whereas the other cuts offer a Mandarin DTS-HD track as well as English and French dubbed DTS 5.1. I would've liked the DC to include an english track as well but I had no problem reading the subtitles while watching the movie.

'Fearless' is a great film and is Jet Li's finest performance by far. The story allows Li to show that he's capable of so much more than just punching and kicking. I can't remember seeing him in anything that was nearly as dramatic and polished as this. The Blu Ray makes what was a good movie before, so much better by offering all 3 cuts in beautiful 1080p with an excellent DTS-HD audio track to accompany each. If you have the previous version, don't hesitate for a second on the upgrade if you can and for the curious, give it a try. It's a very well done film with wonderfully choreographed action scenes by the best in the business, Yuen Wo Ping (Drunken Master, Twin Warriors, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Iron Monkey, Matrix, Kill Bill, etc.) Just don't write it off as kung fu with a story, it's a story with kung fu.

1612679,5,B00005JP0X,"Brought from seller: rm_group  https://www.amazon.ca .  I just watched the Directors Cut last night, the added 40 minute footage was a wonderful addition to the whole movie.  I had watched the US version many times and enjoyed it.  Then reading the comments left on it I found that Canada was selling the actual directors cut with the additional 40 min footage.  Skeptical at buying from an unknown source, I took the chance and bought it anyway.  Shipping was very quick, the seller very nice, the DVD came in original wrapping, price was good.

The Directors cut was totally awesome and explained so much more and was so more indepth.  You could understand the story so much more as well as the connection with all those involved in the story.

There are still 2 more versions in the 2 disk CD for me to watch, The Unrated Version and the Theatrical version.  I don't think that they can give me as much pleasure nor live up to the directors cut, but I shall watch the Unrated Version, since I've seen the Theatrical version, here in the US.

1612681,5,B00005JP0X,"As I was lucky enough to receive the correct copy of this dvd, I'll forgo the misprint snafu and rate the directors cut simply by the film.

Let me first state that I loved the original theatre release of Fearless. I would easily put in my top 10 favorite films of all time. However, this cut does what seems to be impossible these days - it takes a great film and vastly improves on it. When you watch the extra footage that has been added in, you aren't thinking ""Well, I can see why they left that out..."" The film moves just as quickly as the first film, however as a previous poster states, the film feels much more epic. You get a greater sense of the main characters reasoning, and what drives him to act the way he does. You also get a greater sense of his redemption by the film's end.

Also, it seems to me that since the director's cut is unrated, you get a few more broken bone and blood spitting scenes that were cut from the theatrical release to ensure a PG-13 rating. This can be a good or bad thing, depending on your taste in violence in Wushu flicks. Personally, I thought it fit well with the character's hubris during that part of the film.

Finally, this being an Olympic Year, and with the games being held in Beijing, the scenes with Michelle Yeoh hit home just a little bit harder than they would in any other year. With China wanting to show its best side for these games, this movie shows one of the many reasons why this is the case. I found myself seeing a totally different perspective of both the movie and the games with the coincedence of the disc's release time, and it made me appreciate both just a little more.",1218672000,,1647,4.289389067524116
1612682,5,B00005JP0X,"Like many people who had posted reviews here, I too received the incorrect DVD (i.e. the US theatrical version, not the original Director's Cut). As suggested by the helpful individuals here, I emailed Universal Studios Home Entertainment and got a response: they asked me to email them my home address so that they can send a postage paid envelope to mail back the defective DVD (Disc 1). Universal promised to mail the correct one within two to four weeks. I received it in about two weeks, and after having viewed this new disk, I am relieved and satisfied with their prompt response at rectifying the situation.

In terms of the movie itself, the correct Director's Cut is in every respect better than the US theatrical version. Approximately 35 minutes of original footage were cut from the US version -- both a disservice and disrespect to the American audience, who I imagine would have appreciated the relevant backstory and details that make this epic even more powerful and nuanced. For example, the extended scene where a boy was beaten by the neighboring villagers (that the US version deleted) really adds to Huo Yuanjia's mental, emotional, and physical recovery, as do other shorter deleted scenes. In fact, this version provides a much more chronological perspective that unfolds naturally and gives us a better idea of what happened to other minor characters, such as Huo's boyhood rival. In the end, I was able to appreciate this movie even more. As a side note, I wonder why there had been such a big media push to promote ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and so much less given to this vastly superior movie.

Universal was to finally release the International Director's Cut of Jet Li's Fearless to R1 on July 8th 2008 as a 2-disc set containing three versions of the film.  The new Director's Cut on Disc 1, and the original US Unrated and Theatrical versions on Disc 2.

However, one minor...or should I say one COLOSSAL, mistake has occurred in QC at Univeral here.  The very reason for this release...the Director's Cut, is not on Disc 1 as advertised.  (Although the disc is labeled as such.)  Instead, we get two discs with identical content, which, from what I have heard, is the exact same transfer of the contents from the original R1 release from years ago.

So yes, Disc 1 and Disc 2 are exactly the same.  Fortunately, there is a contanct webpage that you can tell Universal your situation and give them your contact information including your address and phone number so that they can send you a self-addressed envelope so that you may return Disc 1 for a replacement.

I've seen the reviews on here that people received two copies of the second disc and no director's disc. I guess I lucked out. I usually make my purchases through amazon but I decided to just pick it up this week at a major retailer 'cause it was on sale for 9.99 and when I checked the first disc immediately it loaded up the Director's Cut. Is it worth double dipping for this edition? Ermm... only if you're a big fan of the movie and wanted to see the extended footage. I just wish US releases could keep the audio from other region releases.,1216684800,,876,4.515723270440252
1612721,5,B00005JP0X,"This is a fun and well written story as far as I'm concerned, Jet Li has been challenging himself in many styles of movies and he's come out on top in each.

I found him to really become the character but still add his level of skill and style to the movie at the same time. I don't think I've really seen hardly any movies of his that I haven't liked. This being one of the top movies I think he's done. Even friends who haven't liked him in other movies have said that they would watch this one again.

If you still have an HD DVD player get this one, it's worth it in HD.

HD quality: 4.5 stars, I did notice a couple dark areas here and there that had some noise in them, looked as if they were taken with a lower quality camera and or transfered from film wrong.
HD audio: my 5.1 system still kicks out great sound and this movie had me looking over my shoulders a couple times, lol. Will make you wonder sometimes.",1216252800,2,920,4.071823204419889

It has been confirmed that JET LI'S FEARLESS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, Universal's highly anticipated re-release of Ronny Yu's Huo Yuanjia biopic promising nearly 40 minutes of additional footage is missing the director's cut. Released July 8th, it promised three versions of the movie, one of which was supposed to be the complete two hour and 21 minute director's cut. However, upon inspecting the two-disc release purchased from Walmart today both discs contain only 103-minute international and theatrical versions. Other readers have been e-mailing and posting messages on this site stating the same problem which suggests this defect is widespread.

Additionally, both discs appear to function erratically in my player. Disc two displays nothing but pixels and disc one periodically will not start up. I was only able to confirm the contents of disc two by using a disc burning tool. Both discs appear to be identical and the director's cut is no where to be found despite what the back cover clearly states.

Universal was unavailable for comment at the time of writing and an e-mail sent Thursday has so far gone unanswered.

At this point I would suggest that anyone who is considering buying this release to not do so until Universal releases corrected discs and issues a statement, preferably along with a recall.

For those who have already purchased the defective FEARLESS discs and are unable to return them to the store, try contacting Universal direct during normal, weekday business hours. You may also want to notify your local retailer.

Here in Canada, it appears our copies of this DVD have been ok. I bought mine from a store in Toronto and I watched the entire Disc 1...and yes, it does indeed have the full extended director's cut.  A friend of mine bought a copy from one of the big retailers here and his DVD was ok as well.

This might have something to do with the fact that the movie is distributed in Canada by Alliance Atlantis, not Universal, and therefore manufactured here (without experiencing the problems that happened with copies made in the U.S.).

If you live in Canada, you probably won't encounter this problem.

1612786,5,B00005JP0X,"FEARLESS is one of the BEST Kung Fu films I've seen in a long time. The film is based on the real-life tale of the legendary Huo Yuan Jia, founder of the Jin Wu Martial Arts Federation. Up to this day, is still considered to be one of best established Kung Fu schools. ""Fearless"" is among Jet Li's best; right up there with his most memorable roles as Wong Fei Hung and Fong Sai Yuk. Some may say that ""Fearless"" is a prequel (of sorts) to Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" (aka. Chinese Connection) and Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"", where the two renowned stars play Huo's greatest student.

The story may be a bit simple, but delivers a strong message NOT to be ignored. It explores the consequences of revenge and the sin of hubris. Arrogance is a strong taint in one's soul and vengeance darkens it. The message is that tolerance and understanding is the way of a TRUE master, humility his tool and above all, honor is the true goal. Huo learned quite a lot in his experiences, and what is more important is that he learned from his mistakes.

The theatrical cut of ""Fearless"" was very good, but it did suffer a bit in pacing. Now, with this Director's cut, we see why. The theatrical release was edited in a way that action films were cut, now, re-cut and re-edited; Fearless is better than ever. It now feels more of a dramatization and re-edited in a way a TRUE Martial Arts Epic should be...

There are major differences in the director's cut, with 40 minutes more footage. This version is even better than the recent unrated version. It includes the opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh and while the previous release started in the middle of the action, this cut begins the story with Huo in a boat. I will outline the scenes because I can still remember (I saw this version in 2006) since this film gave me such impact with its message and emotional action sequences.

1. Opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese diplomat, in the bid to consider Wu Shu in the Olympics.

2. This cut shows more of Huo's childhood. From his determination to study Wu Shu that he stole his father's notebooks that leads up to his second encounter with the boy who had beaten him after Huo's father was beaten in a match. Huo also has a rematch with the same boy before he fought him again as an adult.

3. Huo's arrogance is explored, he is often in a disagreement with his best friend.

4. After he had fled the town and found by farmers. There are additional scenes where he mends. He learns more of the farmers' lifestyle and becomes puzzled how these simple people can be so gentle and humble in their ways. He admires how they care for an old ailing bull. Huo's blossoming relationship with the blind girl is more explored.

5. Now, this is the keeper; this scene was included in the theatrical release in Thailand. Huo defends the honor of a child who is accused of stealing an animal, he offers himself for punishment while an ""incense"" still burns. He engages a Muay Thai fighter in combat but instead of fighting back, he only defends himself and ends up saving his opponent's life.

Now, for the question; is the director's cut worth owning? A RESOUNDING YES...in spades!! Jet Li is in his absolute best in this film. Not only do we see him in excellent fights (choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping), in this cut we also see his skills as an actor. The renowned action star can indeed perform in a very emotion-driven role. The extra 40 minutes of footage is worth every penny that this release even outshines the previous unrated release.

Jet Li claims that this will be his last WU SHU film. ( I hope not). Li has won Best Actor in the recent Hong Kong film awards for his role in the historical epic; ""The Warlords"".  Director Ronny Yu has definitely redeemed himself with ""Fearless"" after his abysmal ""Bride of Chucky"". (Freddy vs. Jason, anyone?)

HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! [5- stars]

The new release isn't a special edition, and there won't be many special features.  The two-disc set will include the Director's Cut, the PG-13 US theatrical cut (103 minutes), and the only slightly different unrated US version (104 minutes).  The last two are already available on the current Region 1 DVDs.  The special features are similar to those on the current DVDs, the featurette ""A Fearless Journey"" (16:04) and some cut scenes (reportedly more than one--there was only one deleted scene on the previous Region 1 releases).

It will be in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen, with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Mandarin Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and optional English subtitles.

Fearless is the highly fictionalized story of the real-life Huo Yuanjia (or Yuan Jia), a hero of Chinese martial arts who died almost a century ago.  The son of a wise martial arts champion who refuses to teach him, Huo teaches himself by, among other things, watching his father train.  Lacking his father's humility, he is a most skilled fighter but commits shameful acts that, when he finally sees their devastating consequences and recognizes his failings, drive him to become an aimless wanderer.  Through the kindness of humble people he recovers and eventually redeems himself in several dramatic ways.

This is a high-budget, beautifully produced martial arts film that will be enjoyed by more than the usual martial arts fan.  Though it doesn't have quite the same pretensions, those who enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Hero and don't mind a fair amount of violence will probably also enjoy this.

Movie Title: Jet Li's Fearless
Movie Release: 2006
Director: Ronny Yu
Writing Credits: Chris Chow, Christine To
On DVD?: Yes

Summation: Slated to be Jet Li's last martial arts film, Fearless takes us on a journey of life and love and all that that encompasses.

Synopsis: The movie starts in Shanghai, China, 1910. Because of Huo Yuanjia's (Jet Li) impressive martial arts skills, he is being pitted against four competitors who represent the four strongest nations: Britain, Spain, Germany and Japan. The rules are that the first to fall or to admit his defeat is the loser. First up at bat is a British boxer. Yuanjia defeats him. Next up at bat is a German soldier. Yuanjia defeats him. Next up at bat is a Spanish swordsman. Yuanija defeats him. Last up at bat is a Japanese martial arts master. It is here that the movie breaks away from the competition to take us through the life of Huo Yuanjia.

As a young boy, Yuanjia watched his father, a martial arts teacher, as he battled his way through several formidable enemies. On one particular day, Yuanjia's father is slated to fight another martial arts teacher, and it seems that the purpose of these fights is to see which teaching style bests the other. Yuanjia's father has the upperhand, and with one striking blow, he could easily kill his opponent. Yet, he decides not to, which allows his opponent to defeat him. Yuanjia's father admits defeat and walks off. Yuanjia, however, sulks, ashamed of his father. His childhood friend, Nong Jinsun (Yong Dong), attempts to console him, but that doesn't help. The son of the winner begins to taunt him, they decide to fight and, of course, Yuanjia loses. It is shortly after this fight that Yuanjia vows to never lose another fight

Thus starts Yuanjia's journey as a martial artist, defeating so many opponents that he allows his status as ""master"" to get to his head. He opens a school to teach others who are willing to learn his teaching style, but he's a bit of an alcoholic, and he welcomes too many students into his school that are only using him for profit. Soon, he finds himself in debt. And, as he does with each time he is confronted, he promises that he will repay the debt.

One night, however, several of his apprentices bring one of their classmates to Yuanjia. This classmate has been beaten, almost senseless, and it is found out that Master Qin, one of Yuanjia's rivals, is behind the beating. Without all of the facts, Yuanjia starts a fight with Master Qin, eventually killing him. Afterwards, Qin's nephew kills Yuanjia's mother and daughter, and Yuanjia kills him before leaving Shanghai. Without giving away too much, Yuanjia meets more characters and is taught the true meaning of life.

Personal Thoughts: The tagline as posted on IMDB.com says ""Fate made him a warrior. Courage made him a hero.""

This movie was intense. The martial arts were choreographed perfectly, giving way to smooth, fluent strokes: arm and leg movements, hand and eye coordination, etc. The martial arts aside, however, the personal journey of Yuanjia was an inspiring tale in and of itself. And, unlike most foreign movies that use American dubbing (I hate when the words aren't aligned with the movement of the mouth. It makes the character(s) appear ignorant.), Fearless uses the characters' spoken language and American subtitles. That, I believe, makes the movie more authentic, more realistic, for me. Much like The Passion of the Christ, viewers are able to experience the culture as it was intended, and with Fearless, viewers are encouraged to understand Yuanjia's personal journey. We, the viewers, are able to sympathize with Yuanjia; when he cries, we cry. This is truly a must-see; hence, 4 stars.",1201132800,4,3765,4.8734375

Touted to be Jet Li's last Chinese Martial Arts flick, this one is a keeper.  The story of a legend rising to the top, falling from grace, and then humbly finding himself again.  Struggling in the face of his own soul and invaders to the land, he comes to terms with who he is and what he needs to stand for.

1612829,5,B00005JP0X,"FEARLESS is one of the BEST Kung Fu films I've seen in a long time. The film is based on the real-life tale of the legendary Huo Yuan Jia, founder of the Jin Wu Federation. Up to this day, is still considered to be one of best established Kung Fu schools. ""Fearless"" is among Jet Li's best; right up there with his most memorable roles as Wong Fei Hung and Fong Sai Yuk.  Some may say that ""Fearless"" is a prequel (of sorts) to Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" (aka. Chinese Connection) and Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"", where the two renowned stars play Huo's greatest students.

The story may be a bit simple, but delivers a strong message NOT to be ignored. It explores the consequences of revenge and the sin of hubris. Arrogance is a strong taint in one's soul and vengeance darkens it. The message is that tolerance and understanding is the way of a TRUE master, humility his tool and above all, honor is the true goal. Huo learned quite a lot in his experiences, and what is more important is that he learned from his mistakes.

The theatrical cut of ""Fearless"" was very good, but it did suffer a bit in pacing. Now, with this Director's cut, we see why. The theatrical release was edited in a way that action films were cut, now, re-cut and re-edited; Fearless is better than ever. It now feels more of a dramatization and re-edited in a way a TRUE Martial Arts Epic should be...

There are major differences in the director's cut, with 40 minutes more footage. It includes the opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh and while the previous release started in the middle of the action, this cut begins the story with Huo in a boat. I will outline the scenes because I can still remember (I saw this version last year)since this film gave me such impact with its message.

1. Opening sequence with Michelle Yeoh as a diplomat, in the bid to consider Wu Shu in the Olympics.
2. This cut shows more of Huo's childhood. From his determination to study Wu Shu that he stole his father's notebooks that leads up to his second encounter with the boy who had beaten him after Huo's father was beaten in a match.
3. Huo's arrogance is explored, he is often in a disagreement with his best friend.
4. After he had fled the town and found by farmers. There are additional scenes where he mends. He learns more of the farmers' lifestyle and becomes puzzled how these simple people can be so gentle and humble in their ways. He admires how they care for an old ailing bull. Huo's blossoming relationship with the blind girl is more explored.
5. Now, this is the keeper; this scene was included in the theatrical release in Thailand. Huo defends the honor of a child who is accused of stealing an animal, he offers himself for punishment while an ""incense"" still burns. He engages a Muay Thai fighter in combat but instead of fighting back, he only defends himself and ends up saving his opponent's life.

Now, for the question; is the director's cut worth owning? A RESOUNDING YES...in spades!! Jet Li is in his absolute best in this film. Not only do we see him in excellent fights (choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping), in this cut we also see his skills as an actor. The extra 40 minutes of footage is worth every penny.

I have the REGION-3 Hong Kong release from EDKO. Unfortunately, there is NO official all-region version. There are a few unofficial ones in Amazon, but be careful, their quality is way below standards.
VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.40 Anamorphic Widescreen. The picture is flawless, strong blacks, radiant colors and nary a speck of dirt or compression artifacts are visible. Clean and sharp, exceptional video from EDKO. 5.1 Dolby EX/6.1 DTS-ES Mandarin track is clear and powerful. Need I say to use the DTS-ES track if you're able.

Final thoughts:
Jet Li claims that this will be his last WU SHU film. ( I hope not)
Movies like this are the reason why I love my multi-region dvd player. Director Ronny Yu has definitely redeemed himself with ""Fearless"" after his abysmal ""Bride of Chucky"". You're forgiven, Ronny!

1612833,5,B00005JP0X,"This film is a true classic when it comes to martial arts films.  The setting is in the early 1900s and based on a true character called Yuanjia.  As explained by Jet Li in the bonus selection of the DVD, he intended for this to be his very last film.  So he wanted to show the true meaning of the martial arts through his character which he did admirably.  I've never seen a martial arts film as action packed but at the same time filled with profound philosophy of what the martial arts are all about, an excellent story, great acting and a beautiful sound track.  One can watch this film and learn more about what the true martial arts are about than watching 100 UFC or NHB matches or 100 beat-them-up-because-they-did-me-wrong martial arts flicks which are so popular these days.

The dialogue between the Jappanese martial artist in the film and Yuanjia was very poignant and made the film for me.  The two sat down and discussed the philosophy of the martial arts over tea and related that to judging the grade of teas.  It was just brilliant.  They had a relaxed conversation with each other and had the utmost respect for one another yet they knew they would later have to fight each other.  After the final match as well as a couple of others (mostly notably O'brien Vs. Yuanjia, chinese fighter vs. Yuanjia's father, Spanish the Dresaza fighter Vs. Yuanjia) I was saying to myself, now that is what the martial arts are all about.

Just one minor point... I wonder why what was said in the subtitles are quite different from the unrated version, the theatrical version and the version which is played on Cinemax.  I think Jet Li made a more profound philosophical statement on the Cinemax version on the tea dialogue scene which is curiously missing from the unrated and PG-13 version.  Although the point is implicitly understood.",1188172800,5,1842,4.648148148148148

The action was great, the acting was (for the most part) good, and most importantly, the film is based in a great philosophy about martial arts and life in general. the story was carried by a flawlessly translated script. a class act all the way. When I rented this movie on DVD shortly after its release, I was horrified to find that, for some unknowable reason, the DVD has a whole new set of subtitles, apparantly set to sync up with the dubbing script. The new subtitles are AWFUL. they completely butchered the script. They turned one of the best philosophical conversations in the history of film-(the ""quality of tea"" scene) into an incomprehensible mishmash. Honestly, you would not believe what a difference the translation makes. Sort of makes me wonder what kind of potential those other kung fu flicks had before they fell victim to bad dubbing.  I hope the director's cut has original subtitles on it and, if that is the case, while the action is still kickass, I advise you to wait for the director's cut so you will have the chance to get the whole movie.",1184457600,4,1128,4.556650246305419
1612856,4,B00005JP0X,"Jet Li's 'Fearless' has all the best aspects you'd want from an Asian movie:  combat with stunning movies that shuffle the deck, ancient, wise lessons, and exquisite beauty that lingers on like a butterfly.  'Fearless' does all of this and more.  The film focuses on a likable protagonist, Hao Yuanjita (Li) who is at the top of his ""wushi"" discipline, and so successful is he that everyone in town wants to be his apprentice.

The movie takes place at the turn of the last century during the Qing Dynasty.  In most scenes the buildings have ancient beauty that is framed by the picturesque horizons, so it is easy to watch.  Every opponent who challenges Hao is introduced and brings a different sort of menace to the stage where a large audience gathers.  For big, burly Master Chin there's sparring over a coffin for a nice effect.  The tension each new challenger Hao must hurdle is given time to build up, especially at the local restaurant where Hao is keen on buying rounds (and gathering debts) of wine for everyone.

There are wisely times for recuperation--for the hero and for the audience.  Lessons about honor, respect, revenge, discipline, and humility are given Confucian treatment, so we care about what happens to all the characters.  Time outs for tea and planting rice maintain a properly restful mood for Hao and the observer.

Exciting and absorbing, 'Fearless' leaves its audience breathless.",1183420800,2,1414,4.894957983193278
1612857,4,B00005JP0X,"Okay, lets get one thing straight first: this is not Jet Li's last Martial arts epic. The trailers were wrong about that and confused alot of people. This is Jet Li's last period Wu Shu film. As many already know, Li is currently working with Jackie Chan on the film the Forbidden Kingdom, in which it is already a fact that they will fight together.

So, now that we have that straightend out, let me tell you my opinion about Fearless.
Jet Li plays Huo Yuanjia, a Chinese Martial Arts Master who is the founder of the Jin Wu Sports Federation and who fought at a tournament to protect the Chinese honour. The way he portrays this interesting character is very energetic and lively. Not just in the fighting, but also in the dialouge scenes. At first it seems a bit unrealistic, but I got used to this style of acting very quickly and only found it very watchable and nice to see. Li shows that Huo Yuanjia was also a normal human being who enjoyed life and had certain issues and does this well.
The film starts very energeticly and shows you one fight after the other, with only some short breaks in between. The movie goes on like this for the whole first hour, which gives alot of excitement and gets the adrenaline pumping for sure for Martial arts and action fans. Then after a dramatic switch in the story, the character leaves his world to the countryside were he stays for a long time. This time is about twenty minutes in the movie were there is no fighting at all. I found this a beautiful and peaceful contrast with the first part of the movie and liked this silence moment. Still, alot of other people don't like this ""break"". It takes away the tempo of the film for that moment, at what I agree, but definitely returns to a stunning final. Either you like this break, like I did, or you find it slow and boring. But I assure you that the scenery is absolutely wonderful in this quiet moment in a storm.
Looking at the sets and atmosphere of the film I can only come to one conclusion: the sets are magnificent and even though you can sometimes see that the computer effects have helped here and there a bit, it gives the film a stunning look. And the scenes that take place on the countryside gives the film a beautiful and almost spiritual atmosphere. The sets are large and beautifully made and they help you to get into the story and feel the atmosphere.
Looking at the action, the film is definitely strong as it gives, like some critics said, ""bonecrushing action!"" It is fastpaced, well shot and shows Li at his best. The only little thing I didn't like at the fights is that even though the editing is fantastic, that at some shots they cut away a single shot out of a movement. This give the movement a certain look. For example, someone falls down to the ground. One second you see him flying through the air, the next second you see him on the ground (still in the same camera-angle), and a part of his falling down has been cut out. Their are only a few small ones of those editing moments, and they overall don't bother you, so don't worry: The fighting is magnificent.

So an energetic and powerful Jet Li in a stunning motion picture that is a must see for martial arts and Jet Li fans. But also for people who want their adrenaline pumping and for who wants to sit on the edge of their seats.",1182816000,5,3322,4.37378640776699
1612858,1,B00005JP0X,"When I first saw this movie (the 104 minute version we have here) in the theatre I enjoyed it very much, but I left with the nagging feeling that something wasn't right about it.  A minor quibble was that a good part of the film's main climactic scene took place right at the beginning, but more bothersome to me was the fact that the film didn't seem sure of itself-- like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a run-of-the mill martial arts picture, or a telling of a historical tale with an underlying philosophical message.  Structurally it came across primarily as the former, but watching this in the theatre I had the nagging feeling that something much deeper was inside longing to emerge.  For one thing, the 104 minute version contains very choppy editing.  Great spans of history pass along in a flash.  For example, during the scene where Huo is living in the village, years are supposed to have passed for him there, however one gets the feeling watching this that it has only been a few weeks.  Furthermore, one simply doesn't buy, in this version of the movie, that he has really learned the lessons he is supposed to have learned-- or even that the film itself has much awareness of what those lessons were.  The narrative seems very rushed, as though the filmmakers simply couldn't be bothered to tell their own story and were eager for the next fight scene to come along.  I remember leaving the theatre thinking that it was a good movie, but also that a better, more fulfilling story, was waiting to be told about this fascinating character.  Little did I know!

Fast forward a few months to the release of this DVD.  I bought it, as I said I enjoyed the movie, but when I watched it I noticed something different about the subtitles-- they seemed to lack the same penetrating subtlety of perception that were found within the best scenes of the theatrical version.  The two most glaring examples were during the ""Tea"" scene, where a very profound exchange between Huo and Tanaka gets reduced to a bunch of gibberish, and at the end, when Tanaka's manager asks him how he could say that Huo won and (in the theatrical version) he says ""I know it in my  heart"" whereas in this version he simply mutters a threat.  Again, it's still a good movie on some level, but watching this version one can't help the feeling that there is something much better within it waiting to come out.

AND THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS.

Surfing around online one night I discovered that there exists a ""Director's Cut"" of this movie that was released early this year (only in China though) that contained a whopping /40 minutes/ of extra footage.  40 minutes?  How do you add 40 minutes to a 100 minute movie without basically making a whole new movie?  This I had to find out.  Fortunately I had previously hacked my DVD player to play all regions so I didn't hesitate to order the movie (which is presently only available in a region 3 compatible format).  When I eventually watched the film, I came to a number of realizations.

1) This was the movie that was originally intended.  It is not one of those ""Director's Cuts"" where loads of extra unnecessary crap is tacked on.  This was the movie that was made to be seen, and it was butchered for its North American release.

2) The movie is an absolute masterpiece and currently resides in my top 5 movies of all time.  I do not say this lightly.  All my uneasiness about the 104 minute version evaporated entirely with this one.  For one thing the structure of the narrative is greatly improved-- the climactic fight scene takes place at the end (where it was always supposed to and where it feels much more natural).  For another, the movie actually feels like a story now-- told completely and deliberately.  The bulk of the footage that was reinserted was from the movie's middle (and most important) act, where Huo is on his self-imposed exile.  This version actually takes the time to flesh out Huo's relationship with Moon, and to show us exactly how the cosmic forces conspired to show him the error in his previous mode of life.  One really gets the feeling watching this version, that Li's character is evolving, and the transition is very believable-- we are right there beside him, taking notes.  Compare this to the shorter version where everything seemed disjointed and rushed.  Furthermore, the Director's Cut contains more footage of Huo as a precocious child, which does much to give us a full picture of his life and spiritual evolution.  An added bonus is that the Director's Cut contains the original, vastly superior subtitles, which actually seem to have been translated by someone who understood the story, and the subtlety of the philosophy it was trying to convey.

3) Lastly, whoever edited this movie for American theatres wanted to do away with the philosophical soul of this wonderful film, and leave us with a stereotypical ""Kung Fu"" flick.  The result was that one of the greatest movies ever made was almost totally lost.  If you just want to see Jet Li dominate, watch Fist of Legend.  If you want to see the spirit and essence of the martial arts captured on screen, a wonderfully told story of a very fascinating character, and a beautiful portrait of how the forces of Nature are constantly conspiring to push us ahead in our spiritual advancement-- watch the Director's Cut of this film.  Anything less is a waste of time.",1182556800,148,5404,4.65331928345627
1612859,3,B00005JP0X,"While this movie is about Huo Yuanjia, it isn't a true story.  Did he exist?  Yes.  Did he found the Chin Woo Association? Yes. Did he compete in a series of fights for the honor of China?  Yes.

That is where the truth ends.  He was not someone who looked for a fight every chance he got, nor was he a spoiled rich kid.  The movie states that he had one daughter and she was killed in revenge by his rival's nephew.

It depicts him as never remarrying or having any children when he died.  Not so, that is why Huo's grandchildren are so upset at this films production.  A far as this film is concerned they don't exist.

The film is well done and script was well written, just wish they hadn't removed the scene where he saved the child from being punished for trying to steal the cow. Choreography was top notch.

I would have given it a higher rating if not for the lack of truth about Hou Yuanjia's character before the challenge matches and his family or in the case of the film, lack thereof.

This isn't Jet Li's final martial arts film, but it is his last martial epic.  He just will no longer be doing this type of movie.",1181347200,4,1130,4.195348837209302
1612860,4,B00005JP0X,"""Fearless"" a film featuring the stunning martial arts skills of the incomperable Jet Li also has a compelling historical story line.  Li plays Huo Yuanjia, the most famous Chinese martial arts master at the turn of the 20th century.  In a 1910 tournament in Shanghai, Huo fought against the best fighters representing countries who were carving up Chinese territory during the age of colonialism, restoring national pride.

The film directed by Ronny Yu is a flashback chronicling the life of Huo who was the asthmatic son of a Tianjin martial arts master.  Years of practice established him as the best fighter in his region.  When a blood feud with a rival master turned deadly killing his family in an act of revenge, Li flees wandering aimlessly through the rural countryside.

He is restored by the affections of blind country girl Moon played by Betty Sun and her grandmother.  Purified in his beliefs he returns to Tianjin and teams with lifelong friend Nong Jinsun played by Yong Dong to form the prestigious Jin Wu Sports Federation.

Jet Li's skills are rivaled only by the legendary Bruce Lee.  If ""Fearless"" is truly Li's last martial arts film then that is a sad loss for all viewers.",1178841600,,1197,4.828431372549019

I bought this movie based on everyone else's high praise for it, and I feel jipped.

The production values are of very high quality, the choreography amazing and the story is simple without being boring. Jet Li does a good job portraying Huo Yuanjia and the rest of the cast is, in my opinion, also up to par.

It definitely brings moral, ethic, valour, honour, and other values in the foreground, but without being preachy. The story, although based on a true story, is quite historically inaccurate, but then again, who takes their history lessons from the cinema?

It's never fair to compare Jet Li's hard-boiled ballet-like Shaolin kicks with Bruce Lee's no-BS brute-force chops, and both movies are extremely entertaining each in its own ways.  ""Fearless"" features great Jet Li kung-fu action, yet it also has a ""soul,"" so to speak: the plot reveals the frustrations and dejections of a people beaten down by foreign ""devils,"" and a populace yearning to regain its lost respect and past glory.  It's surprising to this viewer that the portrayal of the Japanese fighter is very sympathetic, unlike Bruce Lee's or other Chinese-vs.-Japanese fist-fight films.

1612913,2,B00005JP0X,"I tend to be a little picky about which movies I watch, especially for those rare theaters visits, but to some degree for my rentals pick as well.  The factor I most often use to influence my decisions are the films' trailers.  Usually they are a decently reliable indicator of whether I will like a film, although once in a while it proves to be inaccurate (MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND among others).

Unfortunately, JET LI'S FEARLESS is another of those films that catches your attention with an impressive trailer, but turns out to have little else of interest or enjoyment beyond the clips used to advertise it.  The film does feature some impressive martial artistry and choreography, for which Jet Li has become the pre-eminent martial arts action star.  And though his acting ability and language proficiency are limited, he does have a good screen presence.

The weakness lies within the remainder of the film (which composes the majority of it).  It is competently and even skillfully filmed, but the pacing goes from slow to dreary at some points.  The writing is bland and sappy and preachy.  Though the film is based on a true story, there are still points which strain its credibility, most especially the fight between Li's character and the titanic American boxer.  In fact, the creative license they take with the scene crosses that line from creative embellishment to insulting the audience's intelligence.

The film-marketers may lure you in with ""promises"" of dazzling fight scenes (which is what happened in my case), but the bulk of the film is tedious sanctimony.  No umbrage towards those who market and promote this film; they did their job well, though it is little reason to celebrate.  Overall, this is not a terrible film, nor even a bad film.  But it is not a very satisfying movie, and that is ultimately what most influences the ratings (number of stars) that comes with a review.

This film claims to be Jet Li's final epic.  Though Jet Li is still great - maybe among the best - it doesn't necessarily make a costume drama that he is in any more exciting.  If you want to see an amazing martial arts action star who does action-filled (if not very cerebral) movies and his own AMAZING stunts, Tony Jaa is the new champion.",1177286400,3,2250,4.757731958762887

You see him as a child, and this shows how Huo Yuan Jia's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed.  He will go through an incredible transformation before the film's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts.

  The story is very effective, and has a good deal of touching moments. Jet Li fits the role well, and like ""Hero"" it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is.  His facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character.

  Target audience: Anyone in their teens and above who don't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy.",1174780800,6,904,4.658227848101266
1612917,5,B00005JP0X,"I just finished watching one of the greatest Chinese martial arts films I've ever seen. And by ""greatest,"" I mean that director Ronny Yu and the stunning martial arts spectacle Jet Li have teamed up to create one of the most powerful, mind blowing, and action-packed movies of 2006. Based on a true story, the movie is told in flashbacks (which is my favorite type of movie!) about a young boy who even at his young age stands up to defend his father's Wushu (a type of martial arts) clan in late 19th century China. As the movie progresses, Huo Yuanjia grows to become a practitioner of Wushu himself and becomes one of the greatest fighters China has ever seen. The film is spectacular: anyone who has seen Jet Li star in a martial arts epic knows how absolutely stunning the cinematography is. In that area, Fearless does anything but disappoint, creating some of the most mind blowing fight scenes I've ever seen. What I didn't expect this movie to have was it's power factor: you will find yourself almost disturbed in scenes because of the emotional punch it packs inside. Plus, the Unrated version has plenty of ""R-Rated"" style violence and gore to satisfy hardcore blood addicts. The absolute only reason this film didn't get a solid golden 5-Stars from me is because it mostly lacked something that is absolutely essential in a martial arts epic like this, and that is the scenery. I was expecting to see the type of gorgeous and beyond beautiful landscapes and colors and backgrounds like I saw in Jet Li's other film ""Hero."" The village scenes in Fearless had somewhat of this, but where were all the colors? That said, if Fearless had the type of scenery Hero did, it would've easily won my 5-Stars. So definitely, next time you're at Blockbuster, pick up a copy of Fearless and bring it home with you. Make sure to switch the language to Mandarin and turn on the English subtitles to experience the way this movie was meant to be. Oh, and do remember to select the Unrated version, given you don't mind the extra violence, as it is much better than the theatrical.",1174521600,7,2077,4.631436314363143

The movie captured my imagination by taking us back almost a hundred years to 1910 and then rolling back the clock in flashback to 1880 in Tianjin.  You get a sense that time has unfolded when we flashback 30 years, although both times seem in the distant past from our present day perspective.  Jet Li does a good job as Huo Yuanjia who doesn't realize the value of his family, even though he loves them.  The scenes between he and his daughter were charmers.  The tragedy of revenge and retaliation that wipes out his family and sends him on a search for meaning in his life adds depth to the film.  Shidou Nakamura who was in Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" plays the final fight sequence where both opponents have a moral code, while the backers of the fight are motivated by greed.  Dong Yong as Huo's restaurant-owning buddy Nong does a nice job of withdrawing support when Huo is acting from pride.  ""Fearless"" brings you into the story and lets you travel with the characters.  Themes of the importance of family, contributing to your community and not be an aggressor make the film memorable.  Enjoy!",1173916800,3,1280,4.594713656387666

1613015,5,B00005JP0X,"This is much, much better version of the film we were treated(?) to in North American theatres - and it makes that version look like the rushed hachett job it was.  It's a real shame that many Americans, even hardcore Jet Li fans, may never see this film the way it was intended to be seen.

  Not only has the fight against the Thai boxer, and Michelle Yeoh's bookend scenes as a Chinese diplomat trying to sell the International Olympic Committee on including wu shu in the Olympics been restored, but lots of incidental footage that wasn't in the U.S. theatrical cut, and adds.  Combined with the original score that works much better, esp. in the fight scenes where the sound cues interact better with high points in the action, and you have a much, much better movie experience here.

In fact, now that the original whole has been restored, I am sure people will see the film for what it is, less a kung fu movie (despite the convention/cliche-laden plot) and the biopic it was meant to be.  In that it's closer to Spike Lee's ""X', than memorable, but thematically relatively lightweight productions like ""Fist of Legend"" (which could function as a kind of sequel to this film) or any of Jet Li's collaborations with Tsui Hark, ""Swordsman II"", and the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" movies.

Burn your DVD copies of the North American release and get this instead.  And make a spectacle out of it.  The distributers of martial arts films in this country have got to learn not to tamper with Asian films.  I am sure if this version had been released instead, the critical reviews and word of mouth would have been far better - even attracting those who don't usually go in for the kung fu genre.",1172793600,2,1696,4.546052631578948

Based on the sad, true story of Huo Yuanjia, the film is beautiful and moving, as well as breathtaking.

1613021,5,B00005JP0X,"All I have to say is that this movie has a charming story about the true martial artist, Huo Yuanjia, who stood up against all those against China in dire times of diplomatic and social depravity of his people and rose above all odds and in the end, became a legend in his own right. What's sad is that the reality about Huo was so enthralled and mixed with legend that the so called 'truth' about him is a mystery. Was he able to jump over 20 feet in the air? Maybe. Was he truly the most legendary martial artist of all time? He could be. The fact that fiction revolves around his existence, or the short time there was of his (he died when he was in his 40's...) it's hard to tell who he really was... or how he really even died!

Check him out, do some research about him and if you've seen the movie already, watch it again after gaining some insight and knowledge about this legendary man and you might gain an astounding amount of respect for this man and his exploits whether this film does the trick or not... the MESSAGE of the film overrules all else, just as Jet Li intends in this film. He wanted the lesson to be learned, of restraint, of martial arts being purely a defensive mechanics for self-improvement, discipline and insight.

The story tends to jump around, a bit TOO much from one time frame into Huo's adulthood... but the final fight in the end, which is interluded in the beginning, then finished at the end of the movie... is soul moving. I've watched a lot of movies that have brought tears to my eyes, brought joy to my soul and laughter to my heart but the final fight in this movie was one of the most powerful scenes I'd ever seen in filmographic measure-- almost bringing up to the caliber of oldskool cinematography, like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Not comparing, just stating and analysis of the scene-- it's simply something worth noting for on an immensely powerful level.

This movie is a MUST if you love Jet Li.

A MUST if you love martial arts.

A MUST if you love wonderful cinematography.

For those of us with martial arts training and experience who appreciate good acting and a great story, Jet Li is a godsend. Some of the things that make this film a true epic are: its basis in historical fact; the fantastic fight scenes; the superb acting; the profound spirituality that underlies the story (without being ""preachy); and the breath-taking scenery and graphics. When I heard about his previous film in this series, Fist of Legend, I was skeptical about anyone attempting to ""imrpove"" on Bruce Lee's work. I quickly learned, after seeing that film, that Jet Li is no copy-cat, and that he made Fist of Legend, and now Fearless, with his own take on the life of the great Huo Yuan Jia. While there will obviously never be another Bruce Lee, in my opinion, Jet Li is a much better actor and equal to, if not better than, Bruce Lee as a martial artist.

To my surprise and happyness this is more of a drama than an action movie.  Yes it does have some amazing fight scenes, but it also fleshes out Jet Li's character and it got me involved in the story much more than HERO did.

Jet Li delivers a great performance, as do many of the other actors.  The Direction is great and I loved how the movie actually took time off, away from the fighting for about 20 minutes or so in the middle.

The story follows the life of a young man who, following the defeat of his father in a wushu (think: fighting style)contest, resolves to never be defeated in combat using his father's wushu. Thus he evolves into an undefeated fighter. Yet his journey is not without sorrow and pain, and heeding the advice of his departed mother, tempers his anger and arrogance, with patience, compassion and honor. Even after he has been poisoned, to ensure his defeat by his enemies, he continues to fight, and the Japanese warrior he faces nonetheless declares Jet Li's character the winner.

For those of you like me, who like to chat on the computer while watching movies, a word of caution - the movie is in Chinese with English subtitles, so when they're talking you're watching the screen to follow the story, and when they're not talking it's usually on account of a fight sequence...and given the stunning choreography and amazing stunts, you won't want to miss a thing.

2) That this movie wasn't another mindless martial arts movie based on senseless violence and revenge only. Instead focusing on the true meaning of what Wushu martial arts is all about---- which by the way has nothing to do with revenge or violence.

3) Jet Li's mastery of Wushu is phenomenal and is interesting to see his techniques in action.

1613096,5,B00005JP0X,"If this really is Jet Li's final martial arts film, then he went out in dazzling fashion. Now, by no means have I seen all of Jet Li's flicks, but, of all the ones I've seen, FEARLESS has to rank in my top two, sharing honors with HERO. His acting here is nuanced enough that he brings the historical figure Huo Yuanjia to graceful life for his audiences. It helps that Yuanjia's life philosophies closely mirror those of Jet Li's. They both adhere to the belief that the true purpose of wushu is not to merely best a foe in conflict but to, in fact, strengthen one's body, mind, and soul; thus, in a way, this movie also becomes a mini-bio on the actor himself. And need I even mention Jet Li's awesome talents as a martial artist?

In terms of style, FEARLESS is more grounded and earthy than the ethereal CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, and HERO, with a cinematography that is remarkable if not as ambitious in scope as those three other films. Being now 42 years old, Jet Li wanted FEARLESS to have something of weight to say. This film pretty much encapsulates Jet Li's beliefs with regards to wushu. Although the first leg of the film is laden with galvanic, flesh-crunching fight sequences which seem to celebrate violence for violence's sake, the film later transforms itself into a thoughtful and somewhat bittersweet quest for redemption: redemption for the man Huo Yuanjia and for his beleaguered country of China.

Plot and SPOILERS begin: FEARLESS is the turn-of-the-century tale of celebrated Chinese martial artist Huo Yuanjia, who formed the Jingwu Sports Federation and attempted to instill higher ideals within the face of organized fighting. Back then, in the Qing Dynasty, China was considered weak and rudderless, bullied by foreign powers, and mockingly nicknamed the ""Sick Man of Asia."" Into this turbulent setting, in the town of Tianjin, young, asthma-ridden Huo Yuanjia grows up, wanting to be a great fighter like his father, who competes in martial arts contests, each time having to sign a death waiver. However, his father sternly discourages Huo from training in the martial arts (or ""wushu,"" which means ""way of combat""), instead instructing him to practice on his calligraphy. But Huo is adamant and learns to fight anyway. He grows up and becomes a very skilled but arrogant wushu fighter, gaining fame and notoriety. He wins 38 matches in a row and begins a martial arts school. Along the way, he picks up plenty of bootlickers and freeloaders who pass themselves off as friends.

But one disastrous and ill-advised fight changes everything, for him and his family. This devastating tragedy causes Huo to become crazed and to wander off and end up in a distant village. There, in his bedraggled and shell-shocked state, he is tended to by a blind girl named Moon and becomes attuned to the villagers' simple ways. As he grows closer to Moon, he also comes upon and embraces a redefining system of values which he then adapts into his fighting style and into his approach to life.

Having fully recovered, he leaves the tiny village and returns to his school in Tianjin, only to find it destitute and deserted, except for one remaining faithful servant. Determined, he sets out to re-establish his school via competition. Huo ends up facing a monstrous American wrestler named Hercules O'Brien, who he then beats in the ring. Huo becomes a celebrity, which causes worry to surface within the Foreign Chamber of Commerce, who holds China in its firm grasp. Fearing that Huo would become a source of Chinese national pride, the Foreign Chamber issues a challenge for him to engage four fearsome fighters in separate matches, all four matches to take place in the course of one day. Huo accepts, and, in 1910, Shanghai, he fights them. END SPOILERS.

Director Ronny Yu (BRIDE OF CHUCKY, FREDDY VS. JASON) and action director/choreographer Yuen Wo Ping combine their skills to create a harmonious masterpiece of action and philosophy, of brutality and grace, of fighting the good fight and also of turning the other cheek. Ronny Yu manages to maintain a nice pace and also draws out some very credible emoting from his cast. Besides the fine work of Jet Li, there are the more than adequate performances of Dong Yong as Yuanjia's childhood friend Jinsun, Nakamura Shidou as Yuanjia's honorable final opponent Tanaka, and the beautiful Sun Li, who makes her film debut as the serene, blind village girl Moon.

Meanwhile, Yuen Wo Ping continues to dole out jaw-dropping combat sequences. It certainly lends even more credibility that the combatants are mostly legitimate fighters as Jet's opponents range from an English boxer, a Belgian blade & lance fighter, to an expert in Spanish swordfighting. Of course, no one has more credibility than Jet Li himself, who, before retiring at the age of 17, had been the All-Around National Wushu Champion of China for numerous years. In fact, Jet Li is so fast that the camera needed to be filmed at 6 times its normal speed to fully capture all of his movements. With wire work kept to a minimum, we are treated to more realisticallly depicted fight scenes. The lofty platform sequence (with those ascending wooden posts) and the fateful fight in the restaurant, by the way, are the two standouts in the midst of what already are amazing action sequences.

Sad to say, the meager special features consist of only one deleted scene and a 16-minute behind the scenes look which does  include an interview with Jet Li. But never mind that. If Jet Li did indeed decide to exit the martial arts genre, then FEARLESS is a fitting capper. It definitely offers acrobatic, action-packed moments of mayhem while simultaneously remaining sensitive, thought-provoking, and inspirational. This milestone film is textured enough to hold resonance for all the cravers of chop-socky,  historical buffs, and thoughtful cinemaphiles of the world. Thank you, Jet Li.",1169337600,3,5943,4.929070929070929

Another reason to buy this movie is because its Jet Li's last martial art movie and he put all his heart and soul in this movie and it shows. You won't be disapointed.",1169078400,4,491,4.114583333333333

The movie works rather well as both a loving biographical account and a solid period piece on life in China at the close of the 19th century.

While I enjoyed the movie overall, there are some major weakness in the production that keeps it from reaching the lofty heights of previous Chinese films like `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or `Hero.' After a slow start it does bounce back to regain your interest and the ending is a nice tribute to the legendary figure of Huo, but it does suffer from poorly translated subtitles that come across stiff and unrealistic. The film also lacks the epic scope, imaginative vistas and artistry of the previously mentioned films. The fighting scenes are good as one would expect from a Jet Li film, but they don't offer anything we haven't seen before.

1613100,5,B00005JP0X,"I am not a big fan of martial arts movies. Ambivalent is probably the best word for it. Action, fight sequences, slick moves, etc. are all a lot of fun, but won't usually hold my attention for long. However, in this movie, the story really made it worthwhile. An inspiring account of a real historical Chinese master of martial arts and his transformative career, this movie is all about integrity. And the main character is not alone in this either. There are a few villains, but the real villain (and I think the message of the movie) is the main character himself. I really appreciated the honorable qualities of his opponents and how this reinforced the point.

There is plenty more to gain from reflection on this film. Expanding on the subjugation of the Chinese by foreign powers, consider the role that overcoming and disciplining the self plays in maintaining the strength of a nation. This is also a pertinent message for our times.

I enjoyed the entire movie. The action keeps the viewer engaged while these larger themes are explored. The scenery is awesome and there is a definite spiritual quality that comes through. The role of spirituality in  the school that is founded also helps to acknowledge its importance in education in general - yet another instructive lesson for us to consider for our times.

I also watched the documentary on the DVD where Jet Li explains how this story parallels his own. We can learn a lot in as much as our own struggle can be mirrored back to us through the stories of others. This is what truly takes a movie beyond the value of mere amusement.",1168992000,4,1596,4.669039145907473
1613101,4,B00005JP0X,"*Fearless* is about Huo Yuanjin, a world famous Chinese master of wushu, a form of martial arts.  His greatest and last accomplishment was participating a competition of 4 fights with the world's best fighters.

The movie opens with Huo quickly defeating the first 3 fighters.  When the 4th comes up, you're taken back to Huo's childhood, leading up to the last fight.

Bullied and defeated, Huo vows to never lose another fight with anyone.  He was able to fulfil his vow.  However, Huo become cocky and carries little regard/appreciation for life.

However, that all changed when Huo battles a local fighter to death for revenge.  The slain fighter's godson retaliates by killing Huo's family.  Distraught and ashamed, Huo flees the city and winds up in some remote village.

In this village, Huo rediscovers humanity and humbles himself.  Over time, Huo returns home.  From there, he learns of China's participation in a competition for the world's best martial arts fighter.  With support from his friend and students, Huo was able to get in the competition.

The last battle was interesting because it is against Japan's Mr. Mito.  Huo and Mito previously had a friendly get-together with tea.  Their conversation had me laughing.  However, in the last fight, something happens that put Mito in a difficult situation.  Nonetheless, Huo desires to continue and Mito honors it.

I do have to say that I liked that ""choreography"" of the martial arts fighting.  I thought that that story was a bit long.  However, I guess that is the standard with these modern martial arts movies.

But in this movie, he shows us more of his heart and of where his martial arts are coming from. We learn a little bit about the true meaning of wushu to Jet Li, and a little history of China at the same time.

Do yourself a favor and watch the subtitled version though.

Not only are the fight scenes the best I've seen especially with minimal CGI additions but the story is certainly one not told in American theaters these days. The whole philosophy of ""work together as a team - one weak person acting on their own can hurt the community"" type of thing is certainly not the American way. With that being said, this story was portrayed beautifully and could really wake up some of us fat Americans that possibly our way of thinking does not make it right to impose on all other countries. I applaud this film for portraying the last two fighters with respect and honor. It could of been so easy to make the USA fighter as cheater, sore loser, etc. And BTW - this film isn't political at all it just shows how one mans vision can really change the way that people view life and how you keep learning new things up intil the end.

Jet is ONE star that gets me into the movie theaters AND ordering his DVDs. The athleticism of these fighters is incredible. The story of the outward bravado and the inward journey, they too were good.

1613139,5,B00005JP0X,"Having previously known Jet Li from his mediocre Hollywood chopsockies, I wasn't prepared for this affecting and profoundly Chinese work of commerical artistry.

My first surprise was that it's a biopic - the Chinese equivalent of a cross between ""Ali"" [legendary athletic champion] and ""Malcolm X"" [spiritual awakening after life crisis leads to inspiring oppressed underclass]. Indeed, the original title - like that of those films - is simply the man's name. One advance caution: Even after we posit the occasionally superhuman athleticism on display as a genre convention, the viewer must be prepared to accept the narrative as unabashed hagiography. By comparison, Ron Howard's fact-fudging whitewash in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was a demythologizing expose.

But back to that athleticism! The happy pairing of Jet Li, giving a stunning display of late-career mastery, and world-famous fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping is a Baryshnikov/Balanchine-caliber teaming - conveying as few other films have that there's a reason why they're called the martial *arts*. The combat is thrillingly beautiful to watch - as deeply aesthetic an experience as any classical dance recital. [When, in the bonus features, Jet says, ""They couldn't accomplish this in America"", one can't begrudge the self-evident truth of it.] And, for the chopsocky addicts, there's a deathblow so crisply perfect that it had me joyfully shouting ""Deathblow!"" at my TV.

But what makes this such a compelling film - one that will stay with the viewer long after other well-staged kung fu movies have dimmed in the memory to a blur of feet and fists - is that this punch, far from being the champion's capping victory, is his most profound defeat. You'll want to watch the film to fully understand why. Suffice it to say that the movie's theme is aptly stated as ""A fighter's most difficult opponent is himself.""

Huo Yuanjia's ultimate triumph over this opponent made for a moving film experience. And this serves as a glorious capstone to Jet Li's career in martial arts cinema.",1168041600,4,2043,5.181818181818182
1613140,4,B00005JP0X,"Jet Li has been an impressive presence in film as a martial arts practitioner and choreographer both in his native China and in his US films.  He has selected FEARLESS as his final film as a martial artist and a better choice of story for a final bow could not be imagined.

Based on the life of Chinese Martial Arts Master Huo Yuanjia (1869-1910), the founder and spiritual leader of the Jin Wu Sports Federation still in existence internationally, Jet Li acts the role of Huo Yuanjia, a man whose father's heroics were surpassed only by his compassion, a trait the film shows us to be the lesson learned by Huo Yuanjia.  Beginning with his childhood where all of his influences and those people who altered his life are introduced by child actors (the weakest portion of this film), he grows into the role as champion Washu fighter of his province, but his championship is not without problems: he inadvertently kills his final opponent opening a series of tragedies that drives him, a broken man, into the rural area of China where he learns the simple life and ideals of his people.  He returns to his province to visit the sites of his family's memorials and the memorial of the man he killed.  He further accepts a challenge to fight again only this time despite onerous odds he allows his spiritual awakening to govern the outcome.

The film is lushly beautiful with some of the finest cinematography of China we have yet to see.  The choreography of the fight sequences is superb and Jet Li commits his all to the role both as actor and martial arts fighter.  The audience is left feeling a new sense of respect for the travails of China at the early part of the 20th century, for the field of Marital Arts, for the dignity of one of China's heroes, and for the performer/actor Jet Li.  It is a most fitting valedictory. Grady Harp, January 07",1167868800,4,1851,4.56797583081571

I especially appreciate how the show took a great amount of time to show the contrast between using martial arts for reasons of pride and self-indulgence instead of respect and self-restraint.  It shows what it takes to truly become a master of any martial art fighting method.

The action and fighting choreography is fantastic in this movie!  If this is truly Jet Li's final film than he is leaving on a high note.  And to be telling the true story of what happened in 1910 as the hero of the movie (forgive me if I get this wrong, but I believe it was Huo Xianjian) overcomes the worst enemy (himself) to become an example for all of China to follow.",1167436800,3,932,4.291428571428572
1613174,5,B00005JP0X,"Jet Li, champion wushu practicioner and martial arts movies star, has out done not only himself, but other martial artists as well. He, along with director Ronny Yu create not only one of the best martial arts films ever, but an excellent historical story about a man's (Huo Yuanjia) conflict with himself, on his journey to represent an entire country.

This movie showcases some of the most magnificently staged sparring, including matching and different styles and weapons. The first two major fights are ""wushu vs. wushu"" style fights, as Huo Yuanjia, who taught himself wushu against his father's wishes, tries to egotistically turn himself into a local champion, forgetting what his parents tried to teach him, forgetting what wushu and the martial arts are truly about and going only for personal glory. Due to circustances about the 2nd of these fights that should not be revealed, he exiles himself, and learns through self-examination and self-awareness the lessons his parents were teaching.

Upon returning, and seeing the ridicule forced upon the Chinese by other countries at that time (1900's), he takes on the reigning US Champion Hercules O'Brien (played by Nathan Jones, WWF wrestling champion). Truly one of the best choreographed fights in recent film history, the massive Jones against the dimunitive Li is one of the martial highlights of the film.

Huo Yuanjia, with the help of his childhood friend, then founds the Jin Wu Sports Federation (still in existence today), to rebuild pride in China.

The beginning and ending of the film spotlights Huo Yanjia vs. four champions (three from the west and one from Japan). The bonus material in the film briefly reviews these four champions true to life martial arts expertise and experience, giving credence to why these fights scenes are so amazingly real.

The bonus material, especially the ""Fearless Journey"" piece, is an excellent albeit short review of Jet Li's vision of wushu.

This movie is on my list of top ten martial arts films of all time, besting even Jet Li's Fists of Legend and some of Bruce Lee's best. While the martial arts sequences are the centerpiece, the story represents truly what wushu and martial arts are about: the struggle we all have with ourselves to be better tomorrow that we are today. It is an enjoyable film to watch.",1167350400,3,2325,5.010362694300518
1613175,5,B00005JP0X,"For his final appearance in action films, Jet Li has chosen to personify Huo Yuanjia, China's legendary martial arts champion who founded the Chin Woo Athletic Association and brought China unity and national pride at a time when the nation was at the mercy of foreign powers. ""Fearless"" is historical fiction, combining fact, speculation, and purely fictional elements to create an action-packed morality tale and rumination on the meaning of martial art.

""Fearless"" opens in Shanghai, 1910, as wushu champion Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li) represents China against 4 foreign fighters in a match arranged by the Shanghai Foreign Council. Yuanjia wins the first 3 fights, and as we wait for his 4th opponent, the film returns to Yuanjia's childhood and follows the events of his life that led to this point. Yuanjia was a sickly boy who stubbornly pursued martial arts in spite of his father's (Collin Chow) admonitions. Yuanjia's determination leads him to great glory, but he ignores his mother's (Hee Ching Paw) warnings against selfish ambition. Yuanjia's arrogance eventually brings catastrophe, and he must reevaluate his values and his life's purpose.

There are four extended fight scenes in ""Fearless"" plus a few short ones. Director Ronny Yu and fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping have minimalized wire work, lending the fights more realism than I've seen in martial arts movies of late. There is wire work, but physics-defying moves don't dominate. It's difficult to make martial arts movies look fresh, and one attempt to do so is a nighttime fight between Master Huo and Master Chin. I've never seen hand-to-hand combat in such a dimly lit environment. While it does create variety and a certain grittiness, its difficult to make out the intricacies of the fight, so I have mixed feelings about low light combat. Overall, ""Fearless"" is an exciting and thoughtful film, a fitting conclusion to Jet Li's action hero career that exhibits his dramatic acting skills as well.

The DVD (Universal 2006 Unrated edition): You have the option of watching either the theatrical version or the unrated Chinese edit of the film. Bonus features include a deleted scene (7 min) that takes place in the farming village. ""A Fearless Journey"" (16 min) featurette includes interviews with director Ronny Yu, cinematographer Poon Hang Sang, and Jet Li. Li talks about the meaning he finds in wushu and his decision to retire. There is discussion of the film's themes, creating the fight scenes, and shooting film up to 6 times normal speed to capture the movements in the fights.

1613176,5,B00005JP0X,"Set back in turbulent times when foreign forces influenced and intimidated China, Fearless portrays a personal quest of one man, Huo Yuanjia, to discovering the true meaning of Wushu (Kung-Fu).

Huo Yuanjia was one of the founding fathers of Chin Woo Athletic Association and an inspiration to Chinese people.

The movie's story is semi-fictional. It takes Huo Yuanjia's life and understandably adds fictional twists and turns, to make for more dramatic movie experience.

If you don't mind, I'll get my ""constructive criticism"" out of the way first. If you like the good news first, skip the next paragraph and read further.

There are two things I thought could have been done better in this movie:

1. Some of the fighting scenes could have been lengthier

2. Short cuts and bit too many close-ups. It's not necessary for fights like the one with Nathan Jones, because there's not too much flow to this fight, but for some matches I wish they'd just zoom out and let the actors/martial artists do their thing for a minute or two, like the old-school. It's possible. I realize that modern cinematography mostly employs stylized fast cuts, but a longer cut can be stylized too, and is always impressive if done right.

That being said, the strong sides of this movie completely cover the weaker ones. The production values are incredible. The fight scenes are stylish and versatile: you get to see Wushu versus classic boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai (see deleted scene), sword and spear fighting. And of course, the clashing of different styles of Wushu. There's not much wire work, which is a blessing in my book. I'm so tired of wires.

However, the true strength of this movie lies in the way it reflects on the spirit of Wushu. Usually the best you get in a movie is a wise man saying something about how martial arts are to be used only for self defense, and that's about it. Fearless, however, takes a different approach. It shows exactly how and why martial arts can break or make a man (human being rather).

Jet Li's Fearless is a movie that does more than entertain; it inspires to use learned martial arts to fight yourself rather than others, to constantly improve. Jet Li says this movie reflects a lot of his beliefs.",1167350400,2,2230,4.756476683937824
1613177,5,B00005JP0X,This movie made a huge statement.  I believe that Jet Li proved himself to be a versatile actor.  This was the perfect movie that Jet Li chose to end his martial arts epic career.  Great job!!,1167091200,,192,4.277777777777778
1613178,5,B00005JP0X,"This movie, in my honest opinion, will go down as a underated classic in the Martial Arts genre of films. Everything about Jet Li's Fearless is awesome, and downright amazing. First, let's start with the characters; Jet Li's main character is developed very well in this movie. He starts off as a young boy, eager to learn Wushu, but is prohibited by his father. After watching his father battle a rival wushi martial artist, he is disappointed to see him lose. The rivals father has a son, who beats up the young Jet Li - then it begins: he swears to never lose a fight and begins to train by himself at a young age to master his fathers form of wushu. After many battles, he determined to become the best, and even defeats the young man who beat him up when he was a little boy. And this is just the begining of his journey.

But with all this success, comes a price - and this is what the movie delves into. It goes into paying the price for murder, and the consquences of seeking revenge. It goes into hope and redemption for those that have err'd in there way. It has a very good theme, and the acting is great. The movies soundtrack is also very fitting.

Now onto the fight scenes. The fight scenes are incredible. A mix of realism and fantasy keeps them entertaining and fresh - if your worried about ""over-the-top"" fighting, where guys go flying 50 feet everywhere and blood spills all over the place; fret not, there is none of that here. This isn't to say there isn't any fantasy in the fight scenes, but they keep it within reason, and play it off as something believable. The camera angles and sound effects they used during the fight scenes are all excellent. The sound is clear - you can feel every punch, and hear the clashing of every sword. I highly recommend an awesome sound system, or a very nice pair of headphones if you want it real loud in your ears. Easly some of the best fight scenes to ever be filmed. Ever (yes, this easly rivals the old Bruce Lee movies).

The only problem with this movie is the 45min gap in the middle where nothing is really happening. While this does give the movie a break from the non-stop action, it is quite, well, boring. But it does add to Jet Li's character and is a needed to help push the setup for his return to the ring, and to bring honor back to the men of Asia.

I loved the movie itself and for the most part agree with the positive reviews that have been posted here.  I have been a Jet Li fan, as well as a martial arts movie fan in general, for many years and this is by far one of Jet Li's finest films.  Unfortunately, this DVD version suffers from terrible subtitling and a lack of extras for the price.  There are no theatrical trailers, only one deleted scene out of many which have been written about throughout the internet, and no running commentary.  But the biggest problem I had, as mentioned earlier, was the subtitling.  I had watched the Chinese released DVD before the theatrical release and then watched it in the theatre.  There were some differences between these two versions in regards to the translation of the Mandarin and Japanese being spoken, but for the most part were the same.  However, the translation for the US released DVD is totally different in some parts and to me ruined some of the more important dialogue.  One example is when Huo Yinjia is explaining his philosophy on martial arts to his soon-to-be opponent Tanaka.  Also, since I understand just a tad bit of Japanese I knew that some of the translations on this DVD were way off the mark and ruined the overall feeling of those scenes. This was not the case of the Chinese released DVD and the US theatrical release.  Again, I'd like to make it very clear that the movie itself was awesome and would rate 5 stars in book.  The 3 star rating is for the US released DVD.  Whether you saw the movie in the theatre or want to watch it for the first time, I'd stay clear of this version and go to your local Chinatown or Ebay and purchase the Chinese version of the DVD.  How or why they did such a poor job on the translation compared to the US theatrical release and the Chinese DVD is a mystery to me.",1166659200,12,1942,4.373259052924791
1613181,5,B00005JP0X,"I bought the first import version in February of 2006 (1/2 year before the local theatric release; 10 months before the US DVD release) and my only disappointment was the early subtitle translation was less than par...

Now I'm glad to have the unrated version, with better sub's and TRUE 5.1...

I loved Jet's, Fong Sai Yuck, and OUATIN series...as well as Hero, etc.

If you like wire fu or Asian history, you'll like this too...

A true story with Li's fingerprints all over it...",1166572800,4,483,4.647058823529412
1613202,2,B00005JP0X,"I like Jet Li. I like Jet Li's movies.

I like & watch foreign movies so Im used to the voice dubbing &/or subtitles as well as different acting styles.

But this movie was a snoozer from the start. So predictable. So cliche.

The acting was so bad it was like watching a 1970's porn movie where the actors are uncomfortable (because they cant act)& trying to get to the action  with something close to a credible story line. And you're thinking to yourself, ""Would you just get on with it!?""

I fast forwarded through 2/3s of it just to get to the action which was fairly good until the final battle. Please! The main character spewing poisoned blood or vomit all over himself & his opponent while insisting the games go on? Bwahahahahaha...

Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon this movie aint! CTHD was a good story & a great action movie.

This movie may go over big in China but its too weak to make much of a splash in the U.S..

Im sorry to hear Jet Li is going to let this nightmare be his last martial arts movie. He deserves ( or does he ) to go out with something credible. Not this looser!",1166572800,2,1095,4.281553398058253
1613203,5,B00005JP0X,"Jet Li's fearless is a modern classic - I would say the best of the modern Wuxia films that include Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Hero, and House of Flying Daggers. The story of honor, self improvement, mercy, and forgiveness are things that can resonate in our current times. On top of this, the acting is top notch, and the fights scenes are spectacular. If my wife, who hates kung fu movies but came with me to see this one, came away impressed, then I think anyone can enjoy this film

I was however a little disappointed with the extras. No movie trailers, no commentary tracks, not much of anything other than a making of special and one cut scene. I wasn't hoping for the 5 disc extended edition, but a little more would have been nice.

Overall an awesome movie though. I highly recommend it to anyone.",1166572800,4,811,4.510204081632653
1613204,5,B00005JP0X,"I honestly didn't think Jet Li had it in him to make a film as good as FIST OF LEGEND again... let alone one that's even better! FEARLESS proves me wrong, and is quite possibly the best film of Jet's career.

First of all, Jet's acting in Mandarin is a revelation... he's excellent, and the character fits him to a tee. He gets to show a much wider range of emotions than he's been able to in the past (certainly in his Hollywood films), and carries them all off with class. Better than he's ever been, by a wide margin.

Then the production values and the cinematography of the film are A++ - really beautiful, with scenes that approach the sheer aesthetic beauty of HERO... but without coming across so self-indulgent :p Great soundtrack too.

And the fight scenes... wow! The choreography is superlative (though Yuen Wo Ping gets caught out reusing ideas on occasion these days). The fights are mostly very intricate, complex and sophisticated, with a wide variety of styles being used as well. There are some really long takes, and Jet is as fast, agile and powerful as he's ever been - at least since the SHAOLIN TEMPLE films. The way they are filmed shows that it's possible to use ""modern"" camera work and editing (and even a dash of CGI) without rendering the action incoherenent or destroying the flow and impact. It's been a long while since we've seen fights this well choreographed, filmed and performed.

The story of Huo Yuan Jia's quest to become the number one fighter, and his self-discovery and enlightenment as to the ""true"" nature of martial arts, is simple but nicely handled. It continues the progression towards maturity, wisdom and compassion that flows from FIST OF FURY through FIST OF LEGEND (to which FEARLESS is essentially a prequel). I think FEARLESS reflects a lot more of Jet Li's personal views and philosophy than any of his previous works have done - this is apparently the reason why he has said this will be his last period martial arts film, because it says all he has to say through that particular medium. It's a shame, and I hope he changes his mind, because FEARLESS is a triumphant return for Jet Li, and it's hard to imagine him being happy to make more rubbish like CRADLE2THEGRAVE after something like this!

It's also a triumphant return for Ronny Yu, who has also been stuck making Hollywood dross for far too many years. He must have learnt something along the way, or perhaps just stored up all his energy and ideas to unleash in FEARLESS. This is his best work too, in my opinion - or at least equal with BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR. Even cinematographer Poon Hang-Sang can count this amongst his best work.

Basically there is no aspect of FEARLESS to which I would give less than full marks - it's something I didn't expect to see the likes of again - i.e. one of the best martial arts films ever made :)",1165881600,4,2852,4.58235294117647
1613205,5,B00005JP0X,"This is my actual first review that I've done, so I'll try and keep this brief. But I must say, without really going into the detail of the film(I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet), this film is, without a doubt, the best Jet Li film since his movies have hit the big screen in North America, alongside Kiss of the Dragon and Hero. It brings his true style of martial arts to life in this epic. I saw it twice at the theatre, but I'm sure I'll lose count when I have my own copy of it on dvd. Both Jet Li and overall martial arts fans will enjoy this story from start to finish. It's truly inspiring, and to see a diverse side of Jet Li's acting ability in this film, is awesome! Even if this is Jet's last martials arts film or not, Fearless will leave the viewer of it, in contentment, just based on the moral plot of the story; and Li's character overall.  In my opinion, Jet Li has proved enough over the years, with both, his martial arts and acting career. He is the best of this era, but in time someone else will come along to take the torch and run with it. We'll see. So if he's moving in another direction, then we as spectators, or critics, should put our own thoughts aside and just be happy for him; and thankful to have been able to witness another martial arts legend in action and very much still in his prime. Fearless is one of the best movies of the year, hands down. So wonder no longer if you haven't seen this film. Buy it today and see what all of the reviews are truly trying to say! God bless!",1165881600,,1542,4.089108910891089
1613206,5,B00005JP0X,"Let me just say that I cannot wait to own this movie. It was not until after watching it, when reviewing my copy of Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection, that I realized that Jet Li's Fearless is actually the prequel to Chinese Connection. Remember in the beginning of Chinese Connection, when they're talking about their master dying from poison? Well this movie shows you what happened to their master as he grew up and learned to be one of the greatest fighters in the world.

I have seen over a hundred ""kung fu"" movies. Most of them were ""B"" movies at best, but I watched them because of the fascinating martial arts battles which took place in them.

Jet Li's Fearless is by far the greatest martial arts film I have ever seen. The story, screenplay, fight coreography, acting and action are all top of the line.

The fight scenes demonstrate a realism which pays great attention to detail and the authenticity of actual martial arts styles and limitations. They depict characters dishing out and taking a lot of punishment, which was characteristic of practitioners of the Iron Fist, Iron Palm and Iron Body disciplines of Kung Fu.

Taking place in colonial China, it is the true story of a man who stands up for his country against an oppressive regime which is bent upon their humiliation and dehumanization. After defeating a champion British boxer in a boxing ring using amazing Kung Fu techniques, the main character, played by Jet Li, is challenged to partake in a special tournament. Within this tournament, he must defeat four of the world's greatest fighters. They include both masters of weapons and bare handed fighting techniques. Let's just say that the battles between them are epic and amazingly done.

If you enjoy martial arts films, this is a must see. If you know someone who likes them, this movie will not disapoint them. Buy it today, you won't regret it. The flashy fight scenes guarantee much replay value.",1165708800,36,1931,4.786786786786787
1613207,5,B00005JP0X,"Based on the true master's life: Mentioned in Bruce Lee's Chinese connection and Jet Li's Fist of legend.

The U.S. release is NOT the extended cut with Michelle Yeoh's(as Huo's wife) scenes and Jet Li's fight with a Thai kickboxer. The U.S. release also lacks the DTS audio as in the Korean version. Anyway, on with review:
I just finished watching the imported dvd from China in DVD-9 high def and I have to say, I greatly enjoyed this film. This may be Jet Li's finest movie(may be the last martial arts film he makes in China)

The story is based on Huo's real life struggles as a fighter. Although his father banned him from Kung Fu, because of Asthma, he trains to be become the best in his province. After a while he becomes arrogant and overconfident in his skills that he became badly in debt for treating friends and apprentices to parties. Only after he is misled by one of his students into fighting Mr. Quin, the foremost fighter in the land did he learn that being the top. His student got badly beaten by Quin for sleeping with his wife. Huo killed Quin in a contest and Quin's family took vengeance upon Huo's family.

Things fell apart after this incident, he became a drunk and through the kindness of a farming family he learned the true spirit of WU SHU, that sometimes your most terrible opponent is oneself. Upon his return to his town, he learns that foreigners have arrived. A wrestler(Nathan Jones) has been dominating the arena. Huo defeats the large man and the organizers come up with a way to get him to fight 4 opponents to honor Huo's new WU SHU fellowhip. Being a true master doesn't mean you remain unbeaten because sometimes, it takes more strength to lose. You'll know what I mean in the movie.

The martial arts display is amazing. Wires were used, but not overused. Spanish fencing, Karate and other styles were matched against Huo's GONG FU. I am not going to spoil the ending but although the fight scenes have that Jet Li signature, it looked fresh and original.

Set and costume designs were accurate for this martial arts period film. The dvd quality is phenomenal, picture and sound is fantastic. The english subtitles weren't perfect but the DTS audio made the sound perfect.
This film is definitely worth a look if you're a die-hard martial arts fanatic. SPL was my favorite action film for 2005, ONG-BAK THAI WARRIOR was my favorite for 2004, for 2006 it is definitely FEARLESS!!",1164931200,,2425,4.617169373549884
1613208,5,B00005JP0X,"After having recently seen the movie in a theatre, I was very impressed and surprised at how thoroughly I enjoyed the film. It is touching on many levels; it's honorable, heartbreaking, redeeming, and hopeful. I've not been touched by a film like this for so long, and I watch many movies. Not only does Jet Li do a great job in the film, I enjoy every main charachter's performance.

While the film made certain turns that I didn't like, I couldn't void my admiration for the feel of the movie. It's pitiful and sad at points, but, in the end, it's worth watching.",1160092800,3,565,4.485436893203883
1613209,4,B00005JP0X,"This movie was more about the jouney within than about martial arts and action, which is a very important message in today's society.

1613210,5,B00005JP0X,"There are only a handful of movies that capture the ""feel"" of China before the Great Leap Forward.  JET LI'S FEARLESS belongs on that short list. Director Ronny Yu bills it as a martial arts film, which it certainly is, but that is no more to say that GONE WITH THE WIND is mostly about the American Civil War. Prior to this film, Jet Li's last, Li was the prototypical kung fu actor who demolished legions of lackeys while never varying his tone or visage.  I really did not know whether he could act in the classical sense.  It took more than two decades for Li to be the star of a film where acting is at least as important as action.  His acting is superb and is not merely a function of his ability to dazzle with his acrobatics.  In fact, his most memorable scenes occur when he does nothing more than talk to his fellow actors. As I watched him fight, I soon realized that his ability to crunch bones was taking a back seat to actually reaching out to the audience to make them feel his pain. There are numerous critics who have panned Ronny Yu for minimizing the quantity of Jet Li's fight scenes.  This, I think, was precisely the point.  It may have taken Li these many years to feel comfortable enough to radiate feeling with his voice and tone rather than oohs and aahs with his fists and feet.

The opening places Li in the ""present"" of the film, Shanghai in 1910 where Li is to meet a quartet of foreign martial artists, all of whom were ordered not only to defeat Li but to humiliate him, and by extension China. This brings in the ugly subtext of a shameful aspect of the West. It was a time that the West and Japan were busy carving up Imperial China into slices for their own imperialist purposes. As Li fought these four, he was fighting for far more than personal glory.  And when the film shifts into a flashback of Li's life, it brings in a second subtext: the need for a man to triumph over his own inner demons before he can truly call himself a martial arts master.  The youthful Li sees him father duel village ruffians only to defeat them all.  When as a child, he is beaten by a much bigger boy, he swears never to lose again.  It is this exposure to the shame of losing that drives him as an adult to defeat all contenders.  One of his conquests as an adult is his battle with a local competitor, Master Chin.  I did not realize it at the time, but this fight is the climax, not for anything martial even though the fight scenes were truly extraordinary, but only in retrospect could I place it in the two contexts of the film. Master Chin is originally perceived as some sort of bullying thug while Jet Li is pictured as not much different.  In fact, Jet Li, has in this portrayal, actually dared to be a unsavory character.  It is only with Li's realization that Master Chin deserved far better at his hands that marks Li's transformation from a man possessed with the desire to be the best to a man who now struggles with the same desire to learn merely how to be a man. Li is helped along the way by several characters who quite unexpectedly show their own human side.  Nathan Jones (a pro wrestler from the WWE) plays the gigantic American wrestler who can afford to shake Li's hand after Li wins a grueling match.  Then there is his growing relationship with a blind woman who teaches Li that planting reeds properly in soil is part of his healing process.

What emerges from the film is a feeling that for a brief time, I was transported to Imperial China to participate vicariously in Jet Li's metamorphosis.  After witnessing Li's overwhelming performance which ought to rate an Oscar nomination, this film is truly what a martial arts film could be.  It was just too bad that it took Jet Li this long to fulfill his potential in this his last movie.",1159056000,10,3788,4.3522727272727275
1613211,5,B00005JP0X,"""Fearless is billed as Jet Li's last martial arts movie.  If that is true he could not have ended on a higher note.  ""Fearless"" is the fictionalized account of Huo Juanjia, the Wushu master who was one of the founders of the Chin Wu Sports Federation in 1910, which promoted the martial arts and its unity throughout the world to this day.

The story starts with the Huo as a child with his wanting to learn Wushu from his father the master.  He is not allowed because he has asthma.  The story jumps to years later and now Hua is the master and he is a champion Wushu master.  You realize that even though he is the best, there is something lacking from his life.  Most of the rest of the story is his education to learn what is truly important with the ending climaxing of his learning and his international acclaim.

Jet Li does a wonderful job of portraying Huo Jianjia.  Dong Yong plays Huo's lifelong friend and serves as his Jimminy Cricket throughout the movies as his sense of duty and honor.  Betty Sun's character teaches Huo the importance he is missing.  The rest of the cast is wonderfull, but not nearly as important as Jet Li.

The action scenes are choreographed by Yeun Wo Ping.  He is the best in the business today and has been for many years.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Matrix Trilogy, Kill Bill Vol I & II and the irreverent Kung Fu Hustle are just of few of his more famous films.  The action scenes are going to be remembered with the best of all time because they are that good.  If you liked ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", you will loves these sequences.  There is not a missed moment the entire movie.  Full of action, yet beautiful to watch.  The fight secens with the three-piece-staff are the stuff of legend.

""Fearless"" works on two levels: it is deeply introspective and the action is out of this world.  If you like martial arts films just for the action, you will love this film.  If you like movies for the script and visuals, you will also love this film.  This is one of the best genre films made.  This is certainly Jet LI at his best and should not be missed.  It is truly better than ""Hero"" and I thought that was his best at that time.  Truly stunning.  Highly Reccommended.",1158969600,5,2237,4.405867970660147
