3135392,5,B0014VPFM2,"A must for any Duke fan.  This two-disc movie collection makes a fine closing addition to the Dukes series.  In the first movie, Bo, Daisy, and Luke come home to Hazzard, where they learn that a greedy developer wants to build a thruway over the swamp.  The problem?  Their home's in the way.  So, the cousins buckle up for another adventure.  In the second movie, the Dukes, Roscoe, Cletus, Enos, and Cooter attempt to raise money for an establishment in Hazzard by going to Hollywood and selling a bunch of good ol' fashioned country tapes.  Both movies are filled with fun, adventure, and romance.  So buckle up, and get ready for a rip-roarin' good time with the gang you grew up with and grew to love.  Catch ya on the flip side, I'm gone.",1215734400,,744,4.492537313432836
3135393,5,B0014VPFM2,"This 2 DVD set is 100 percent fun for every Dukes of Hazzard fan. Seeing how the actors have aged over the years since the series finale in 1985, but still delivered a neat acting quality, makes you feel comfortable watching the movies. Also in terms of imagery and camera technique, the movies now have clearer picture than the series back in the 80`s (although still shot in 1,33:1).
A real fan will buy this DVD for sure ; so just figure out the plots for yourself, but expect that The Dukes of Hazzard have changed from fighting the corrupt system of the Boss/Rosco regime into some kind of two-men army going after bad guys and mobsters.",1215302400,,642,4.495726495726496
3135394,5,B0014VPFM2,"This is an awesome DVD.  Though they did not have the original theme song, they had the original cast!!  Reunion was pretty good!  But Hazzard in Hollywood was even better!!

I would recommend this to any Dukes of Hazzard fan!",1214956800,,226,4.575
3135395,5,B0014VPFM2,"One reviewer entitled his/her review ""Now We Can Complete Our DVD Collection"". Sorry,but but this is just one step closer to completion. The Dukes Of Hazzard spinoff Enos should be available on DVD,and that would complete the DOH collection. Since I previously wrote reviews for these two telefilms,previously available on VHS,I won't elaborate(the synopeses). Sadly,since this CBS series ended its 6 1/2 year run in 1985,two cast members have been taken away by the good Lord. I'm speaking of Sorrell Booke who died of cancer in 1994 at age 64 and Denver Pyle who died of lung cancer on Christmas Day 1997 at age 77. Most of the overall survivors are all back. Those who didn't return were the late Bewitched veteran Dick Sargent who filled in for James Best during Best's temporary departure from the series,Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer whom the latter two filled in for the original stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider(Cherry and Mayer were later written out and Wopat and Schneider returned). Pyle lived to reunite with his fellow DOH cast members to do the first film in 1996 and his character Uncle Jesse Duke's death was written into the second film,shot in 1999. When DOH's third season(1980-81) was released on DVD in May 2005,the spinoff Enos(the entire series) should have come to DVD along with it. We'd see Deputy Enos Strate(sorely missing Hazzard and the people there) working for the Los Angeles Police Department. These telefilms air occasionally on CMT(Country Music Television). By the way,I didn't want to finish without mentioning the legendary Waylon Jennings. Jennings,who died of complications from diabetes in 2002,wrote and performed the DOH theme GOOD 'OL BOYS and also served as off-screen narrator(""The Balladeer""). In fact,Jennings did once guest-star as himself in a 1984 DOH episode. I dedicate these films to the memories of Booke,Pyle and Jennings(1937-2002). GOB,which was on hit parade in 1980,was later covered by Wopat,Schneider and their co-star Catherine Bach,altogether. Their version was expanded by a few additional verses that were not Jennings' own. Schneider sang,""Waylon,we miss you,had a hell of a time on TV!"". Warner Bros.,DOH's production company,was all prepared for an eighth season,but all-time low(lower than during the Cherry/Mayer era) ratings suddenly forced CBS to cancel the series without a special farewell. Long live Hazzard County,Luke,Bo,Daisy,Cooter,Roscoe,Enos,Cletus,Coy and Vance. R.I.P. Uncle Jesse and Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg.",1213747200,,2506,5.411764705882353
3135396,5,B0014VPFM2,"I love the Dukes of Hazzard television series. I've watched all the series, and thoroughly enjoyed the good country adventures of the Duke family and their friends. (Except that episode with the alien... that was stupid!)

These TV movies are really an extension of the series, and serve as a continuation of the DVD sets, complete with similar menus. (Though there are no scene selections menus.)

In ""Reunion!,"" the original cast returns in their roles (with the exceptions of Sorrell Booke and Waylon Jennings). The Dukes and Cooter battle the plans of a land developer to turn Hazzard Swamp into a theme park. Meanwhile, former deputy Enos Strate finally asks Daisy Duke to marry him.

In ""Hazzard Goes To Hollywood,"" the town responds to an offer for three million dollars towards a new hospital by raising a half million on their own. Deciding to sell the tapes of live country music performances recorded in Hazzard, the Dukes (now minus Denver Pyle as Uncle Jesse), Rosco, and Cooter head to Hollywood to make a deal. However, things get complicated...

The video quality on these DVDs is excellent, probably just as good as they could have looked when they first aired. I did note that ""Reunion"" ends a couple seconds short during the Warner Brothers logo, but who cares about missing that?

The DVDs have no special features, except that Disc 1 (""Reunion!"") opens with trailers for the 2005 ""Dukes of Hazzard"" movie, the direct-to-video ""Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning,"" and the TV show on DVD. In addition, the DVDs are also subtitled and closed captioning.

Great release! If you love the original Dukes of Hazzard show, buy this DVD set! There's rumors that if this sells well, Warner Brothers will release the Dukes spinoffs ""Enos"" and ""The Dukes"" animated series!",1213401600,2,1779,4.933110367892977
3135397,5,B0014VPFM2,"I am so excited to see these finally comming to DVD!! I am ready for the cartoons & Enos!! I would also like to see the TV specials for the Dukes all in one set (E!

The TV specials would all fit on one disc, without commercials they are only around three and a half hours total.",1208044800,6,408,3.9878048780487805
3135398,5,B0014VPFM2,Thanks again to Warner Bros for releasing these 2 movies. These movies should have been on the big screen!!!

3135484,5,B0014VPFM2,"Most fans give the first movie the thumbs up and the second an almost-thumbs up, but I rate each film to be good and better then what most people might say. 'Hazzard Reunion' was a great performance on behalf of the whole cast. It captured the quality and fun of the TV series. 'Hazzard in Hollywood' put the Dukes and crew a little out of their element, and it did not always sync well. However, it also provided some well-done scenarios, catch 22's,  and chases as well as adding a slew of guest cast members that were perfect for the odd synergy between South and West. The music in both movies was excellent and the respect for Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse after their respective deaths is very touching, considering the rivalry between them from the series. Boss Rosco was an interesting character as well, and James Best is a favorite of mine anyways, as well and Ben Jones as Cooter.
Overall, This DVD set is a must for the overall Duke of Hazzard fan and a reminder of when TV was wildly good to the last drop :)",1402531200,2,1017,4.380952380952381

3135501,5,B0014VPFM2,"I was privileged to be able to watch the old Dukes of Hazzard television series when I was in high school when it first came out. I love that show because of so much that I liked in it, such as the General Lee Car, Daisy and the stunts like jumping the cars. I now have all of them on DVD and I can watch them anytime and I see they were teaching moral standards in different ways back then. I saw parts of the 1997 Dukes of Hazzard Reunion but never got to see all of it until I bought it from Amazon. That was when I discovered the Hazzard in Hollywood that I didn't realize that the original cast made. I was impressed with both of these movies because they still have that great down to earth quality with the original cast, unlike the newer movies with other people in them that are demoralizing. Then not too long ago I bought another set from Amazon for a cousin of mine who is also a die hard fan of The Dukes of Hazzard. Once again Amazon came through for me on this product and it was delivered 2 days to my home before the scheduled date. Anymore I check with Amazon first on any movie or tv series I want before trying to find them in another store!!!!!!!",1388707200,2,1167,4.100436681222708

3135534,4,B0014VPFM2,"I watched the two Dukes of Hazzard movies (Reunion & Hazzard in Hollywood). Let me explain something. They were both good but the first one the Reunion to me in my honest opinion was the better of the two. It reunited the whole cast with the exception of Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg); RIP dude, you are missed. It had its moments but at least the story took place in Hazzard County. The downside was that Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse) had to wear a fat suit because he had lost a significant amount of weight. It had a story you could follow. I'd give the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion movie an 8/10.  Hazzard in Hollywood wasn't that bad but with the passing of Denver Pyle after the first film it just lost its touch. It's good to put in the DVD player and see the remaining cast but it feels rushed with no value. I'd give Hazzard in Hollywood an 7/10, maybe I need to watch it more just to appreciate it as much as the Reunion.",1336435200,2,919,4.221590909090909
3135535,5,B0014VPFM2,"I'm sure for most that the two Dukes of Hazzard movies made in 2005 and 2007 left bad tastes in most people's mouths. They did for me. The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) and the Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (2007) are absolute abominations to the Dukes of Hazzard legacy. They should have never made them and I for one have forgotten them completely.

The Dukes of Hazzard aired on CBS from 1979-1985. I was born almost to the day five months before the series finale aired on February 8, 1985, thus ending the Dukes Of Hazzard tv series. Prior to the ending of the show, two spinoffs were aired ""Enos"" from 1980-1981 and the animated series ""The Dukes"" in 1983. Needless to say the Dukes of Hazzard was in its prime during the late seventies and early eighties with three television programs and countless memorabilia from toy cars to bedsheets.

There is no doubt that this show spawned millions of fans throughout its run. I can remember having some toy cars from the Dukes as a child that my parents no doubt bought before the show ended. I was formally introduced to the Dukes of Hazzard in 1996 when the Nashville Network (TNN) started airing re-runs. The re-runs lasted until 2001, when the network was purchased by Viacom, thus becoming the National Network and later on, Spike TV. Needless to say, I became a fan and was hooked. Later on in 2002/2003 I had the honor of meeting Ben Jones who played ""Cooter"" on the Dukes and had the pleasure of visiting his museums and gift shops in Gatlinburg and Nashville, TN. I have collected Dukes memorabilia ever since, ranging from autographs to personal memoirs.

Anyway, The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood were aired during the time that the show was being re-ran on TNN. They were both ratings successes.

The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! which was made in 1997 features the original cast, sans Sorrell Booke (he passed away in 1994) getting together to stop a greedy business woman who wants to build an amusement park in Hazzard swamp. This telefilm was written by Gy Waldron who created the original show. It has the same vibe as the series and is a whole lot of fun.

Hazzard in Hollywood which aired in 2000 features all of the Hazzard gang heading to Hollywood in an effort to raise money to build a new hospital in Hazzard. This one was fun too and feels just like an episode of the original series.

Congratulations is in order to Warner Bros. for releasing these films. This is timeless entertainment folks, the like of which we will never see again. They need to make a few more Dukes movies with the original cast. The audience has never left. The Dukes of Hazzard is now being aired nightly on CMT for a whole new generation to enjoy. Yeee-Haaa!!",1334016000,4,2749,4.6

3135539,5,B0014VPFM2,It was worth the wait.  If brings the series around full circle.  I was appropriate to add Sorrel Booke in the final credits.,1293667200,,125,4.391304347826087
3135540,4,B0014VPFM2,"This takes me back to when I was a kid in the '80s and tuning in to CBS on Friday nights to watch THE DUKES OF HAZZARD go back to back with THE INCREDIBLE HULK. The Dukes were always all about family values and the iconic General Lee and that theme song and Bo and Luke Duke and sexy Daisy Duke (and now you know where those Daisy Duke shorts came from). This two-disc DVD set collects the two made-for-television films which reunited the cast. Bo and Luke are still just two good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm, never mind that one is now a professional race car driver and the other is a senior smoke jumper. These two movies bring the series' trademark plate of cornpone and homespun and yeehaw. Good fun. Probably not for everyone, probably not for the hoity-toity pinky-finger-up-in-the-air-while-sipping-his-latte city slicker.

THE DUKES OF HAZZARD: REUNION aired in 1997 and it catches us up with what the Dukes have been up to (and there are some surprises; I didn't see Cooter's career change coming). With Boss Hogg having passed away, a new conniving no-good-nik steps into Hazzard County. Bo, Luke, and Daisy (and Cooter and Enos) return to Hazzard only to find Uncle Jesse in deep trouble and despised by just about everyone, at that. Josephine ""Mama"" Max has come to town, and she aims to build a theme park, except that the Dukes' swamp land stands in its way. Uncle Jesse ain't selling, and this is costing the good folks of Hazzard an assortment of jobs promised to them by Mama Max. Thus, the ill will towards Uncle Jesse, y'all.

A contest is proposed, to take place at the Homecoming Festival: an overland moonshine race between the General Lee and the only car that ever whipped the General. If the General wins, Uncle Jesse wins a thousand dollar prize. If the General loses, Uncle Jesse grants Mama Max access thru his property. Now if only the Dukes can find out whatever happened to the General. And then deal with Mama Max's underhandedness. And her nasty goons.

LAPD officer Enos Strate comes to town, and I'm glad he's getting respect. Enos still has his eyes on Daisy, and this time Daisy is eyeing him back. This bodes for possibly the biggest wedding ever in Hazzard. This is the kind of movie, by the way, in which Daisy Duke can ask the villainess, Mama Max, to help plan for her wedding... and Mama Max accepts. This is also the kind of movie where people have things like rattlesnake chili cook-offs. And, because you're not thrown off enough, Cynthia Rothrock shows up as a hillbilly martial artist competing in the annual Tough Person Contest. On the other hand, some things are immutable. The Hazzard County speed traps; Bo wielding that bow and arrow; the bar brawl at the Boar's Nest; Rosco P. Coltrane (now Boss Rosco) just being ridiculous. The Dukes are back, still making their way the only way they know how. But that's still just a little bit more than the law would allow.

Three years later, country comes to La-la-land in HAZZARD IN HOLLYWOOD. Hoping to make enough money to build a hospital in Hazzard, the Dukes make their way to Hollywood to sell tape recordings of famous country singers who've performed in past Hazzard County hoe-downs. And then a thug with an eye patch starts taking potshots at them. The Mad Russian Igor, a Los Angeles crime lord, wants those tapes, as well. And then, as if the Dukes aren't already neck deep, Rosco P. Coltrane gets involved with a loan shark.

Pitting the Dukes' countrified sensibilities against the urbanity of Los Angeles isn't anything new. Enos Strate had his own short-lived series back in the day when he first transferred to the LAPD. There was even an episode in ENOS in which Bo and Luke visited Enos in LA. It's no surprise that Bo and Luke and all get the best of the Angelinos (those cholos never stood a chance) and manage to adapt to their more cosmopolitan environs (it's their movie, after all). In LA, the oblivious Enos is a babe magnet, Daisy is a fearless stunt woman, Bo and Luke attend a block party hosted by vatos, and that the Russian crime lord is hooked on country line dancing. There is new love and lost love. Toby Keith sings. John Schneider sings a duet of a Merle Haggard ballad. Mac Davis is the Balladeer and he's on screen and isn't too shy about breaking the fourth wall. Just a normal day for them Dukes.

No special features on these discs. That sucks.",1291507200,3,4388,4.6048593350383635
3135541,5,B0014VPFM2,"I was so excited to get hold of the better Dukes movie after that rotten theater movie and the television movie The Beginning all but ruined the classic characters.  What makes the classic Dukes funny is that the characters don't try to be funny. They take their characters series as the TV show and these movies fall under the Genre of Drama rather than comedy.

Since the actor that played Boss Hogg had passed away The Dukes of Hazzard Reunion movie has Rosco as the new Boss of Hazzard. The family members have grown up with Daisy off to collage, Luke a fire fighter and Bo a nascar driver returning to town to try to save Duke farm and the local swamp from a land scheme of Rosco and and big city con artist.  It has all the elements one expect from the television show plus Enos asking Daisy to marry him.

The second movie has the town trying to save up enough money to build a new hospital when a visiting con man suggest taking the recordings of all the people who played in Hazzard over the years and re master the music to sell on a Hollywood label.  To prevent the hospital from being build another con man with a grudge to settle has hired muscle to steal the tapes. What more the Russian mob and chop shop gangs are all in it for themselves. It's laughs a plenty as those still living like it the 1970s enters L.A's 21st century.",1289174400,16,1343,4.292490118577075

3135549,5,B0014VPFM2,"Like the Star Trek Series, the Dukes of Hazzard movies were a welcome addition to the beloved franchise and a better capper than final season seven (1984-1985).
Unfortunately Sorrell Booke passed away before ""Reunion"", and Denver Pyle would pass afterwards (Waylon Jenning was also missing as the balladeer). As for the rest of the cast,they're obviously having a great time in their old roles.
Of the films themselves, Reunion was like a true family reunion with the sight of the entire cast(including an obviously ill Denver Pyle) picking up perfectly from twelve years ago. Hazzard in Hollywood was the more action packed fare as the cast is removed from Hazzard into a different locale.
 Five years later a big screen treatment of TDOH was released which lacked the series warmed and fun and replaced it with toilet humor. For fans of the series, these were the true Duke movies and a better way to end the series.",1228003200,,918,4.8471337579617835

I did think it was quite sad in the reunion movie what happened to the General Lee, the way he was found.

3369891,5,B0014VPFM2,"This is an awesome DVD.  Though they did not have the original theme song, they had the original cast!!  Reunion was pretty good!  But Hazzard in Hollywood was even better!!

I would recommend this to any Dukes of Hazzard fan!",1214956800,,226,4.575
3369892,5,B0014VPFM2,"One reviewer entitled his/her review ""Now We Can Complete Our DVD Collection"". Sorry,but but this is just one step closer to completion. The Dukes Of Hazzard spinoff Enos should be available on DVD,and that would complete the DOH collection. Since I previously wrote reviews for these two telefilms,previously available on VHS,I won't elaborate(the synopeses). Sadly,since this CBS series ended its 6 1/2 year run in 1985,two cast members have been taken away by the good Lord. I'm speaking of Sorrell Booke who died of cancer in 1994 at age 64 and Denver Pyle who died of lung cancer on Christmas Day 1997 at age 77. Most of the overall survivors are all back. Those who didn't return were the late Bewitched veteran Dick Sargent who filled in for James Best during Best's temporary departure from the series,Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer whom the latter two filled in for the original stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider(Cherry and Mayer were later written out and Wopat and Schneider returned). Pyle lived to reunite with his fellow DOH cast members to do the first film in 1996 and his character Uncle Jesse Duke's death was written into the second film,shot in 1999. When DOH's third season(1980-81) was released on DVD in May 2005,the spinoff Enos(the entire series) should have come to DVD along with it. We'd see Deputy Enos Strate(sorely missing Hazzard and the people there) working for the Los Angeles Police Department. These telefilms air occasionally on CMT(Country Music Television). By the way,I didn't want to finish without mentioning the legendary Waylon Jennings. Jennings,who died of complications from diabetes in 2002,wrote and performed the DOH theme GOOD 'OL BOYS and also served as off-screen narrator(""The Balladeer""). In fact,Jennings did once guest-star as himself in a 1984 DOH episode. I dedicate these films to the memories of Booke,Pyle and Jennings(1937-2002). GOB,which was on hit parade in 1980,was later covered by Wopat,Schneider and their co-star Catherine Bach,altogether. Their version was expanded by a few additional verses that were not Jennings' own. Schneider sang,""Waylon,we miss you,had a hell of a time on TV!"". Warner Bros.,DOH's production company,was all prepared for an eighth season,but all-time low(lower than during the Cherry/Mayer era) ratings suddenly forced CBS to cancel the series without a special farewell. Long live Hazzard County,Luke,Bo,Daisy,Cooter,Roscoe,Enos,Cletus,Coy and Vance. R.I.P. Uncle Jesse and Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg.",1213747200,,2506,5.411764705882353
3369893,5,B0014VPFM2,"I love the Dukes of Hazzard television series. I've watched all the series, and thoroughly enjoyed the good country adventures of the Duke family and their friends. (Except that episode with the alien... that was stupid!)

These TV movies are really an extension of the series, and serve as a continuation of the DVD sets, complete with similar menus. (Though there are no scene selections menus.)

In ""Reunion!,"" the original cast returns in their roles (with the exceptions of Sorrell Booke and Waylon Jennings). The Dukes and Cooter battle the plans of a land developer to turn Hazzard Swamp into a theme park. Meanwhile, former deputy Enos Strate finally asks Daisy Duke to marry him.

In ""Hazzard Goes To Hollywood,"" the town responds to an offer for three million dollars towards a new hospital by raising a half million on their own. Deciding to sell the tapes of live country music performances recorded in Hazzard, the Dukes (now minus Denver Pyle as Uncle Jesse), Rosco, and Cooter head to Hollywood to make a deal. However, things get complicated...

The video quality on these DVDs is excellent, probably just as good as they could have looked when they first aired. I did note that ""Reunion"" ends a couple seconds short during the Warner Brothers logo, but who cares about missing that?

The DVDs have no special features, except that Disc 1 (""Reunion!"") opens with trailers for the 2005 ""Dukes of Hazzard"" movie, the direct-to-video ""Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning,"" and the TV show on DVD. In addition, the DVDs are also subtitled and closed captioning.

Great release! If you love the original Dukes of Hazzard show, buy this DVD set! There's rumors that if this sells well, Warner Brothers will release the Dukes spinoffs ""Enos"" and ""The Dukes"" animated series!",1213401600,2,1779,4.933110367892977

3369981,5,B0014VPFM2,"Most fans give the first movie the thumbs up and the second an almost-thumbs up, but I rate each film to be good and better then what most people might say. 'Hazzard Reunion' was a great performance on behalf of the whole cast. It captured the quality and fun of the TV series. 'Hazzard in Hollywood' put the Dukes and crew a little out of their element, and it did not always sync well. However, it also provided some well-done scenarios, catch 22's,  and chases as well as adding a slew of guest cast members that were perfect for the odd synergy between South and West. The music in both movies was excellent and the respect for Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse after their respective deaths is very touching, considering the rivalry between them from the series. Boss Rosco was an interesting character as well, and James Best is a favorite of mine anyways, as well and Ben Jones as Cooter.
Overall, This DVD set is a must for the overall Duke of Hazzard fan and a reminder of when TV was wildly good to the last drop :)",1402531200,2,1017,4.380952380952381

3369998,5,B0014VPFM2,"I was privileged to be able to watch the old Dukes of Hazzard television series when I was in high school when it first came out. I love that show because of so much that I liked in it, such as the General Lee Car, Daisy and the stunts like jumping the cars. I now have all of them on DVD and I can watch them anytime and I see they were teaching moral standards in different ways back then. I saw parts of the 1997 Dukes of Hazzard Reunion but never got to see all of it until I bought it from Amazon. That was when I discovered the Hazzard in Hollywood that I didn't realize that the original cast made. I was impressed with both of these movies because they still have that great down to earth quality with the original cast, unlike the newer movies with other people in them that are demoralizing. Then not too long ago I bought another set from Amazon for a cousin of mine who is also a die hard fan of The Dukes of Hazzard. Once again Amazon came through for me on this product and it was delivered 2 days to my home before the scheduled date.

3370031,4,B0014VPFM2,"I watched the two Dukes of Hazzard movies (Reunion & Hazzard in Hollywood). Let me explain something. They were both good but the first one the Reunion to me in my honest opinion was the better of the two. It reunited the whole cast with the exception of Sorrell Booke (Boss Hogg); RIP dude, you are missed. It had its moments but at least the story took place in Hazzard County. The downside was that Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse) had to wear a fat suit because he had lost a significant amount of weight. It had a story you could follow. I'd give the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion movie an 8/10.  Hazzard in Hollywood wasn't that bad but with the passing of Denver Pyle after the first film it just lost its touch. It's good to put in the DVD player and see the remaining cast but it feels rushed with no value. I'd give Hazzard in Hollywood an 7/10, maybe I need to watch it more just to appreciate it as much as the Reunion.",1336435200,2,919,4.221590909090909
3370032,5,B0014VPFM2,"I'm sure for most that the two Dukes of Hazzard movies made in 2005 and 2007 left bad tastes in most people's mouths. They did for me. The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) and the Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (2007) are absolute abominations to the Dukes of Hazzard legacy. They should have never made them and I for one have forgotten them completely.

The Dukes of Hazzard aired on CBS from 1979-1985. I was born almost to the day five months before the series finale aired on February 8, 1985, thus ending the Dukes Of Hazzard tv series. Prior to the ending of the show, two spinoffs were aired ""Enos"" from 1980-1981 and the animated series ""The Dukes"" in 1983. Needless to say the Dukes of Hazzard was in its prime during the late seventies and early eighties with three television programs and countless memorabilia from toy cars to bedsheets.

There is no doubt that this show spawned millions of fans throughout its run. I can remember having some toy cars from the Dukes as a child that my parents no doubt bought before the show ended. I was formally introduced to the Dukes of Hazzard in 1996 when the Nashville Network (TNN) started airing re-runs. The re-runs lasted until 2001, when the network was purchased by Viacom, thus becoming the National Network and later on, Spike TV. Needless to say, I became a fan and was hooked. Later on in 2002/2003 I had the honor of meeting Ben Jones who played ""Cooter"" on the Dukes and had the pleasure of visiting his museums and gift shops in Gatlinburg and Nashville, TN. I have collected Dukes memorabilia ever since, ranging from autographs to personal memoirs.

Anyway, The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood were aired during the time that the show was being re-ran on TNN. They were both ratings successes.

The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! which was made in 1997 features the original cast, sans Sorrell Booke (he passed away in 1994) getting together to stop a greedy business woman who wants to build an amusement park in Hazzard swamp. This telefilm was written by Gy Waldron who created the original show. It has the same vibe as the series and is a whole lot of fun.

Hazzard in Hollywood which aired in 2000 features all of the Hazzard gang heading to Hollywood in an effort to raise money to build a new hospital in Hazzard. This one was fun too and feels just like an episode of the original series.

Congratulations is in order to Warner Bros. for releasing these films. This is timeless entertainment folks, the like of which we will never see again. They need to make a few more Dukes movies with the original cast. The audience has never left. The Dukes of Hazzard is now being aired nightly on CMT for a whole new generation to enjoy. Yeee-Haaa!!",1334016000,4,2749,4.6

3370036,5,B0014VPFM2,It was worth the wait.  If brings the series around full circle.  I was appropriate to add Sorrel Booke in the final credits.,1293667200,,125,4.391304347826087
3370037,4,B0014VPFM2,"This takes me back to when I was a kid in the '80s and tuning in to CBS on Friday nights to watch THE DUKES OF HAZZARD go back to back with THE INCREDIBLE HULK. The Dukes were always all about family values and the iconic General Lee and that theme song and Bo and Luke Duke and sexy Daisy Duke (and now you know where those Daisy Duke shorts came from). This two-disc DVD set collects the two made-for-television films which reunited the cast. Bo and Luke are still just two good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm, never mind that one is now a professional race car driver and the other is a senior smoke jumper. These two movies bring the series' trademark plate of cornpone and homespun and yeehaw. Good fun. Probably not for everyone, probably not for the hoity-toity pinky-finger-up-in-the-air-while-sipping-his-latte city slicker.

THE DUKES OF HAZZARD: REUNION aired in 1997 and it catches us up with what the Dukes have been up to (and there are some surprises; I didn't see Cooter's career change coming). With Boss Hogg having passed away, a new conniving no-good-nik steps into Hazzard County. Bo, Luke, and Daisy (and Cooter and Enos) return to Hazzard only to find Uncle Jesse in deep trouble and despised by just about everyone, at that. Josephine ""Mama"" Max has come to town, and she aims to build a theme park, except that the Dukes' swamp land stands in its way. Uncle Jesse ain't selling, and this is costing the good folks of Hazzard an assortment of jobs promised to them by Mama Max. Thus, the ill will towards Uncle Jesse, y'all.

A contest is proposed, to take place at the Homecoming Festival: an overland moonshine race between the General Lee and the only car that ever whipped the General. If the General wins, Uncle Jesse wins a thousand dollar prize. If the General loses, Uncle Jesse grants Mama Max access thru his property. Now if only the Dukes can find out whatever happened to the General. And then deal with Mama Max's underhandedness. And her nasty goons.

LAPD officer Enos Strate comes to town, and I'm glad he's getting respect. Enos still has his eyes on Daisy, and this time Daisy is eyeing him back. This bodes for possibly the biggest wedding ever in Hazzard. This is the kind of movie, by the way, in which Daisy Duke can ask the villainess, Mama Max, to help plan for her wedding... and Mama Max accepts. This is also the kind of movie where people have things like rattlesnake chili cook-offs. And, because you're not thrown off enough, Cynthia Rothrock shows up as a hillbilly martial artist competing in the annual Tough Person Contest. On the other hand, some things are immutable. The Hazzard County speed traps; Bo wielding that bow and arrow; the bar brawl at the Boar's Nest; Rosco P. Coltrane (now Boss Rosco) just being ridiculous. The Dukes are back, still making their way the only way they know how. But that's still just a little bit more than the law would allow.

Three years later, country comes to La-la-land in HAZZARD IN HOLLYWOOD. Hoping to make enough money to build a hospital in Hazzard, the Dukes make their way to Hollywood to sell tape recordings of famous country singers who've performed in past Hazzard County hoe-downs. And then a thug with an eye patch starts taking potshots at them. The Mad Russian Igor, a Los Angeles crime lord, wants those tapes, as well. And then, as if the Dukes aren't already neck deep, Rosco P. Coltrane gets involved with a loan shark.

Pitting the Dukes' countrified sensibilities against the urbanity of Los Angeles isn't anything new. Enos Strate had his own short-lived series back in the day when he first transferred to the LAPD. There was even an episode in ENOS in which Bo and Luke visited Enos in LA. It's no surprise that Bo and Luke and all get the best of the Angelinos (those cholos never stood a chance) and manage to adapt to their more cosmopolitan environs (it's their movie, after all). In LA, the oblivious Enos is a babe magnet, Daisy is a fearless stunt woman, Bo and Luke attend a block party hosted by vatos, and that the Russian crime lord is hooked on country line dancing. There is new love and lost love. Toby Keith sings. John Schneider sings a duet of a Merle Haggard ballad. Mac Davis is the Balladeer and he's on screen and isn't too shy about breaking the fourth wall. Just a normal day for them Dukes.

No special features on these discs. That sucks.",1291507200,3,4388,4.6048593350383635
3370038,5,B0014VPFM2,"I was so excited to get hold of the better Dukes movie after that rotten theater movie and the television movie The Beginning all but ruined the classic characters.  What makes the classic Dukes funny is that the characters don't try to be funny. They take their characters series as the TV show and these movies fall under the Genre of Drama rather than comedy.

Since the actor that played Boss Hogg had passed away The Dukes of Hazzard Reunion movie has Rosco as the new Boss of Hazzard. The family members have grown up with Daisy off to collage, Luke a fire fighter and Bo a nascar driver returning to town to try to save Duke farm and the local swamp from a land scheme of Rosco and and big city con artist.  It has all the elements one expect from the television show plus Enos asking Daisy to marry him.

The second movie has the town trying to save up enough money to build a new hospital when a visiting con man suggest taking the recordings of all the people who played in Hazzard over the years and re master the music to sell on a Hollywood label.  To prevent the hospital from being build another con man with a grudge to settle has hired muscle to steal the tapes. What more the Russian mob and chop shop gangs are all in it for themselves. It's laughs a plenty as those still living like it the 1970s enters L.A's 21st century.",1289174400,16,1343,4.292490118577075

3370046,5,B0014VPFM2,"Like the Star Trek Series, the Dukes of Hazzard movies were a welcome addition to the beloved franchise and a better capper than final season seven (1984-1985).
Unfortunately Sorrell Booke passed away before ""Reunion"", and Denver Pyle would pass afterwards (Waylon Jenning was also missing as the balladeer). As for the rest of the cast,they're obviously having a great time in their old roles.
Of the films themselves, Reunion was like a true family reunion with the sight of the entire cast(including an obviously ill Denver Pyle) picking up perfectly from twelve years ago. Hazzard in Hollywood was the more action packed fare as the cast is removed from Hazzard into a different locale.
 Five years later a big screen treatment of TDOH was released which lacked the series warmed and fun and replaced it with toilet humor. For fans of the series, these were the true Duke movies and a better way to end the series.",1228003200,,918,4.8471337579617835

I did think it was quite sad in the reunion movie what happened to the General Lee, the way he was found.
