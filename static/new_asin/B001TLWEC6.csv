ON the History Channel it didn't include the ""Time Machine"" part of this, but anyway. A great documentary about the the rise and fall of the counterculture of the late sixties and many key figures and events well worth watching and owning.",1447632000,,370,4.3768115942028984

Went to Amazon, and there it was. fast shipping, good price, most of all....took me back to my teen years. covered alot of that Era. I recommend this DVD to anyone, especially those that grew up during this time. Trip down Memory Lane!!",1344211200,2,361,4.569230769230769
