8049447,5,B0007OC3S6,"This is but Part 1 of a 3 part series on the amazing VW Beetle. Rather well done,with excellent narration and emotional background music. I bought my copy of the series back in the mid 90s when Rocky Mountain Motorworks was the exclusive retailer. Very expensive videos,nonetheless worth every dime. Chapter 1 is very historical...lots of original videos and still shots. Later chapters covered the VW ads in America (and Doyle Dayne Burnbach's selling techniques),and an amazing look at what it takes to build a Beetle on the assembly line,accompanied by a very catchy ""imported"" soundtrack,and a running scroll on the bottom of the screen charting the Beetle changes from 1949-up to the (then) current. When they made this series,they did it right. Shame its not on DVD.....its the best Beetle videos yet.",1125187200,2,807,5.075187969924812
