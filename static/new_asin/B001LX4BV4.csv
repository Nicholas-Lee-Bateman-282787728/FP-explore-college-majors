8319955,4,B001LX4BV4,"This is a very compact and taut little gem. Well narrated by old pro,Brian Blessed(I Claudius,etc),the work will leave the viewer wanting to add other titles in the series. The only downside is the short running time;but better a little too short,then too long for the subject covered. The British do this type of documentary better than almost anyone else in the world. Would make a great gift for amateur or serious scholar. One cannot ask for much more than that summary.",1383955200,2,474,4.7926829268292686

8319957,4,B001LX4BV4,This is a well made dvd about the roman invasions and the struggles of the britains. It covers allot of what tactics the romans used and the weaknesses of the britains. I just wish it was a longer dvd.,1339632000,4,201,4.17948717948718
