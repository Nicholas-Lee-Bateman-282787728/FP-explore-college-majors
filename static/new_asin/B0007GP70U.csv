2211811,1,B0007GP70U,"From what I watched on TV compared to this junk I must say that my wife and I are totally not happy at all with this series and will Never buy any others. This was our first ones we bought and will be Ebaying them today.

I am not sure why they have to push their agenda of immorality,adultery and homosexuality on people. Every episode had something to do along those lines.

I believe that there was no true creativity that was put into these series at all. It is the same crap that you see every day in our world. Where are the true film makers that can truly come up with soemthing that has nothing to do with immorality,adultery and homosexuality.

Totally a waste. Only watched 2 and skimmed the others hoping for something with true murder mystery material it was not found in any of these films.",1167523200,10,803,4.34
2211812,4,B0007GP70U,The BBC is brilliant at these decadent mysteries set in bucolic serenity. This is an outstading example of this skill. Nettles and Casey are both modern and classic as the detective pair with a nice spin on the relationship that develops interestingly over the course of the partnership. This set contains the first five shows of the series. Cimamatography is a prime feature so what this series on a good TV.

2211813,5,B0007GP70U,"What can one say? This is a terrific Series. The acting is wonderful...and showing the family life in-between the ""murders"" gives a feeling a reality. Cannot say enough about this set...except to say I have watched it three times!!",1125014400,13,231,4.948717948717949
2211814,5,B0007GP70U,"Contains one of the most humorous episodes in which Barnaby is unwittingly stoned on muffins.  As always, Midsomer Murders is fine entertainment",1122940800,11,144,5.545454545454546
2211815,5,B0007GP70U,"As we watched the episodes in Set Five, I said to my husband, ""Doesn't Barnaby look younger?""  Sure enough this set of films was made arond 1996-7 and therefore predates some of the earlier sets released by Acorn Media. This is not a problem, but I am concious of Barnaby's entire family appearing much younger, and Sgt Troy so new to the force he is still pointing out the obvious to Barnaby, and failing to notice some things he should. Barnaby's daughter is back in school and trying to decide whether to change her school major to acting. (Often her acting provides a clue toward solving a murder.) Everyone has longer hair and is thinner.

The second episode (of five) is my favorite so far. (These episodes are so good I am not going to rush through them just so I can tell you about them.) At one point, Barnaby's daughter brings home a Russian kitty she has named 'Killmouski' who soon takes over Barnaby's bed, chair and everything else--if you live with a cat you can imagine the interaction.

The plots in these episodes are the best in the series and I have watched all the films in the other sets. These early stories seem more like the early Morse episodes in complexity, and like them must have been based on real books, not relatively underdeveloped screen plays. The characters are well developed. Each of the mysteries in the MidSomers series is set in a different mythical village in Southern England and constitute what Diana Rigg calls ""cozy"" mysteries that could be updates of the Marple novels (the plots are different).

Morse fans will recognize JoAnna David, as well as several other supporting actors, and 'Rebbecca' fans will recognize Anna Massey. Jonathan Firth (who has many facial tics similar to those of Colin Firth--are they related?) appears in an episode involving a shocking discovery by an older retired teacher (who ends up dead).  One of the great delights of these stories is the acting which is always absolutely fabulous.",1112486400,111,1965,4.767647058823529

2211856,5,B0007GP70U,"This is my favorite set of the Midsomer Murders series as it contains my favorite episode,  The Killings at Badger's Drift.  The reason for that being my favorite episode is because it contains my favorite of all the bizarre characters that Barnaby and Troy investigate.  The characters are the Rainbirds (mother and son) and they were portrayed most excellently by the actors Richard Cant and Elizabeth Skaggs (sadly she has since passed away).  I am thrilled to have this set because now I have the Rainbirds and of course I have the set where the two reappeared in another Midsomer Murder case, this time as sister and cousin of the Rainbirds.

2211857,5,B0007GP70U,"This is actually the first season's episodes of this program. Not sure why it is called Set Five.

I think this is a really great detective series, but it might take some getting used to for some. You might need a British sense of humor/outlook to fully appreciate it.

The first episode, The Killings at Badger's Drift, is really a bit strange. And the older detective does kind of pick on the younger one to a larger extent than seems called for in the context of the story. But, as the series progresses, the stories get better and the detectives get along better.

In other words, if you don't like the first episode, try a few more before deciding if you'll continue watching. I think I watched the first five seasons in a few weeks. It got pretty addictive after I gave it a chance.

The series pokes fun at British village life as it goes along - the episodes are all set in various English villages in the fictional county of Midsomer. They don't seem as safe and nice as you might think - at least as this series presents it. All in good fun I guess. Well, at least one person gets murdered in every episode, so maybe fun is not the right word. But, I'm American, so maybe I shouldn't say one way or another.

Give it a try.",1379203200,,1233,4.297413793103448
2211858,1,B0007GP70U,I did not like the characters.  The stories were bazaar and weird.  Extremism to shock you.  Hard to understand how so many unusual people can live in one area.  Watched the first 2 shows and threw the whole lot of them away.,1377129600,,225,4.285714285714286

I can't see returning the entire package for one tape.  Eventually, I'll probably replace the whole thing with an Early Cases package but can't do it now because of other expenses  Anyway, I was disappointed in this sale",1358640000,,568,4.5

Slow moving as compared to American Law and Order SUV and fell asleep with each one. By buying them we can watch over and over. I also ordered Box, 1,2,3 & 4 now and that should keep us for a long time. They are done very well and if you don't fall asleep, you will feel like you saw something very nice when over.

However, compared to the mysteries of today, I found it to be a little mild.  But, I watched it twice and ordered another, so it must be appealing!",1323302400,,316,4.216666666666667
2211932,4,B0007GP70U,"Love the show, not the purchase...
I love this show. I'm an Anglophile from way back when and love just about all British TV, especially their comedies and crime drams. Midsomer Murders is one of the rare few crime dramas that puzzle me. I usually figure out quite quickly ""who done it?"" in most crime drama/mystery/suspense show and films I watch, which takes some of the fun out of it for me. So far out of viewing ten episodes of Midsomer, I was able to guess accurately who the killer was in just 2. This is an interesting, aborbsing, though-provoking and entertaining series. You have to watch it to know what is going on. You can't just listen and do something else at the same time.
I just purchased my first set of DVD's, Set 5. The only problem I had was that the new set I ordered from Amazon, not a market place seller was that my set contained two identical DVD's and no disc 5 of the series. I certainly didn't expect that from purchasing a new set from Amazon. I was a bit disappointed and annoyed. Since the order was fulfilled by one of their sellers, Amazon stated that they can only refund my money and not send a replacement. So be forwarned, if you order this set. When I went back to Amazon to reorder another new set, the price jumped up to $6.00 more than what I had originally paid. Shame on you Amazon for making this purchase a pain in the neck. I've been shopping regularly with Amazon for at least 10 years now and have never experienced such a bad purchase. I did not get what I paid for here. Now I have to go to a UPS drop off to return the package and buy this set used from a Market place seller or wait until Amazon drops the price to what I paid. Or deal with a foreign rep in chatting or calling Amazon to see if they'll give me a new set for what I originally paid.",1319846400,,1802,4.195965417867435
2211933,5,B0007GP70U,We love this British series and hope they never end. We have bought several sets from Amazon and watch them over & over again.  At our age we can never remember who done it so it makes every set enjoyable and relaxing.,1313712000,,218,4.190476190476191
2211934,2,B0007GP70U,"I bought Set Five of Midsomer Murders based on a chronology given by a reviewer on Amazon.  If I am going to start a series I like to follow it in chonological order.  I didn't see the series on TV but the reviewer stated that the first episodes were contained in Set Five.  I am 2/5ths of the way through this boxed set and I am baffled by the great reviews that this series has garnered.

These two first episodes present some of the nastiest persons that it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. Life is way too short to spend it with people who are so mean-spirited.  First of all, Inspector Barnaby is constantly and unnecessarily sarcastic to his young Sargeant.  There is no reason for this except for unkindness of spirit.  Secondly, in these two episodes everyone sneers at everyone else.  Even if there were no other faults in these episodes who with a healthy mind would want to spend time with these really unpleasant people.  But there are many other things wrong. The killer(s) turn out to be two self-absorbed young people - brother and sister - who have been having an incestuous relationshiop since they were teens and who killed in order to make way for the sister to marry a widower whom they then plan to kill for his money.  There is a hideous mother-and-son blackmailing duo who are grotesque and sickening in their relationship.  But all these nasty people, unpleasant as they are, pale in comparison to those in Episode Two.

In Episode Two we have sexual abuse of a young boy by his father, patricide, transvestites and the sort of teenagers that reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  A high school drama club decides to entice their drama teacher to have a sexual relationship with one of the fifteen-year-old girls, photographs him and then, as a group, sends him the photos and tries to blackmail him for money.  When he declines to pay these little monsters post the pictures on the village green so that the whole town can see them.  And, as usual, everyone is sneering at everyone else all of the time.

Except for Inspector Barnaby's wife and daughter there doesn't seem to be a single normal human being in these first two episodes and I am really at a loss to understand the fulsome praise that this series has received.  If one wants to see life in an English village I'll take Miss Marple every time.  There are unusual characters to be sure but the overriding miasma of plain mastiness and meanness that I've encountered in Midsomer Murders is entirely absent in the Agatha Christie characters as developed in Miss Marple and in Hercule Poirot.

I will watch the next three episodes because I bought them but I am fearful of what horrors next lie in store.  Let's see: we haven't had necrophilia yet, nor cannibalism.",1296777600,10,2755,4.60655737704918
2211935,4,B0007GP70U,"I enjoyed these shows.  The subtile way the English writers set the scene and progress to the conclusion is a little different.

Set 5 is the best, and the stories in Set 5 include all 5 of the Catherine Graham novels set in fictional Midsomer County that have been televised, including the BBC pilot, ""The Murders at Badger's Drift"". The productions are lavish and set in the lovely English countryside and manor houses.  The plots are intricate and the solutions satisfying.  In spite of multiple murders in each episode, the violence is never dwelt on.  The domestic life of Chief Inspector Barnaby clearly works to lighten the tone.  Each character seems to be finely drawn.  Barnaby's dry wit introduces many comic moments.  The acting is superb, and the plots are well crafted.  In fact, I enjoy watching the episodes as much or more the second or even the third time as I did the first time, even if I remember who the murderer is. Don't miss Set 5.
