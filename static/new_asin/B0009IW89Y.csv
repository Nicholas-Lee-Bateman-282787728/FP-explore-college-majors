8061379,4,B0009IW89Y,"This play by play by American officials detailing their response on 9/11 to deal with the immediate threat posed from the air was very interesting.  I was pleasantly surprised by how candid some of those officials were in their interviews.  These were people who were actually engaged in the response that day, including the military, police, journalists and others from political circles.  Dynamic film footage of events enhanced the points covered in the interviews.

As an aside, it was also interesting to read the various reviews and stances taken by others who have seen this documentary.  Whether one agrees with all of the information provided by those interviewed, or leans more towards a conspiracy theory, I highly recommend ""Clear the Skies: 9/11 Air Defense"" to anyone who has an interest in learning more about the tragic events of that day.

For those hard of hearing, there were no subtitles available with this dvd.",1217548800,3,932,5.0588235294117645
8061380,5,B0009IW89Y,"This is a great minute by minute account of 9/11.  It has been one of my favorite documentaries since I first saw it aired on PBS some years ago. It has lots of orignal footage of the day and first-hand interviews with those that were on Airforce One, in the White House, and in the fighter jets. The BBC has really out-done themselves with this one!",1212192000,8,350,4.303030303030303
8061381,1,B0009IW89Y,"so it just so happens that on that day only four aircraft were available to defend that massive area of airspace?  The absence of defense, the complete collapse of three buildings, one not even hit by planes and on the other side of the WTC, the admission that building WTC 7 was demolished, the live media coverage of witnesses saying how the second plane was not american, the lack of any physical evidence at sights like the pentagon of things such as the huge titanium engines which could not have burned to nothing, the reports of explosions just before the collapse.... and i have only scratched the surface.  Wake up.  WTC was demolished,  this film is b******t.",1158364800,5,669,4.6923076923076925
8061382,4,B0009IW89Y,"As someone who was living in the Washington area on ""9/11"", watching this program was hard at times, especially knowing in advance what the end result would be. That said, I would recommend it to anyone who would like to understand what went on during that morning in September 2001. For those who would like to see a flip-side to this story, I would recommend the very gripping (and sometimes disturbing) film The Hamburg Cell, which details the lives of the hijackers (yes, they were real people contrary to what some seemingly disturbed individuals would claim).

As an aside, I feel compelled to point out one thing related to the assertion made by a previous reviewer that, ""This is a propaganda film designed to prop up the US Government's official story about 9/11."" Since someone would have to be seriously deficient as a human being (I'm talking about being a truly moronic sicko) to actually hold the view that there was no terrorist attack on that day, and I'm sure that characterization does not apply to the previous reviewer, we can safely assume that their claim was not meant to be taken seriously and should be disregarded.

Even if it was meant seriously, there is a key point that any reasonable person would be happy to take into account. ""Clear the Skies"" was produced by the British (yes, that's British) Broadcasting Corporation. Seeing as propaganda is one of the few things America excels at producing domestically, why would the U.S. government outsource it to the British?

In any case, as with most dubious conspiracy theories, the key argument against it is the sheer number of people who would have to have been involved. Considering that things like Watergate and Iran-Contra were handily exposed in periods with far less media saturation, it strains credulity to believe that something of the scope 9/11 theorists envision would not have come to light. Some true patriot with inside knowledge would have talked by now, because that's how actual conspiracies (e.g. Watergate, Iran/Contra) come to light.",1148256000,15,2034,4.958944281524927
8061383,1,B0009IW89Y,"Here are some crucial facts that are missing from this propaganda film:

1) It is an absolute, disgusting lie that, ""The very idea of the United States being attacked by air was unimaginable and unexpected.""

For one thing, various agencies, including NORAD - North American Air Defense - had run several exercises involving the exact same scenario that transpired on 9/11, for years before 9/11/01.

For another thing, the US government was given very specific warnings about the upcoming attacks on 9/11 by more than 10 other countries in the months prior to 9/11, including Israel, Germany, Egypt, Russia, among others.

Even the Pentagon ran an exercise a year before 9/11 involving a Boeing 767 crashing into the Pentagon. Another similar exercise involving the same scenario was scheduled in early 2001, but was rejected for being ""too unrealistic"". That is because the area around the Pentagon is restricted air space, with surface to air missiles ready to shoot down anything that comes too close to the Pentagon. What happened to the Pentagon's air defense on the morning of 9/11/01? Think about that.

Anyone who bothers to do a minimal amount of education about the US Air Defense system will discover that for the last several decades, the US Air Defense has trained for and has been designed for quickly dealing with any potential threat to North American air space, including by missiles, aircraft, spacecraft, and any other object that can fly through the air. Combat ready squadrans are scattered across the continent in order to be able to intercept any aircraft over any part of North American air space within about 15 minutes. There is very scrict procedures in place well before 9/11/01 that requires all aircraft acting errantly, such as loss of communication, going off course, loss ot transponder, etc., to be intercepted. No permission was required for these kinds of intercepts to be made, prior to 9/11/01. But, Dick Chaney had Donald Rumsfield issue a directive just before 9/11/01 to change those procedures, requiring them to get permission from Donald Rumsfield before sending out an intercept. Why did he do that when the system was working so well before that? And, why did he change that rule after 9/11/01 to the way it was before?

2) An average of about 100 aircraft per year, both before and after 9/11/01, have been intercepted by NORAD, and the average intercept time was between 10 and 15 minutes. This very competent and efficent Air Defense System - the world's best - has been in place for several decades. But, on 9/11/01 NORAD went AWOL. Hijacked planes were allowed to fly around US airspace for more than 1 and a half hours after knowledge of hijackings was confirmed. Why?

What else it the government lying about regarding 9/11? A lot! There are over 150 holes in the official government story about 9/11.

I recommend educating yourself about the truth regarding what really happened on 9/11. It is the duty of every American to know this truth and understand the threat that the criminal cabal controlling our government is posing to our democracy. Watch the following DVDs:
The Great Conspiracy - free on google
Loose Change - free on google
9/11 Revisited - free on google

Check out the following web sites:
[...] - Schollars for 9/11 Truth

Please, look at all the evidence for yourself and find out the truth. That's all I ask. Get all the facts, especially those that the government is covering up. Then, decide what you are going to do to get our country back from these fascists.

Educate yourself. Don't just accept what is spoon-fed to you by the government or the mainstream media.",1145491200,28,3644,4.889789303079416
