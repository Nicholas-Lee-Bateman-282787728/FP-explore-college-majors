4978990,5,B0068O312Q,"Bought this DVD Set for my wife. Now I use it myself.  I have a library of about 20 or so workout DVDs and this one has become my favorite.  Its a real challenge and it has really worked muscles other videos missed.  This one is for guys too so don't be afraid of the name.

Pros: works muscle groups missed by other DVDs, no equipment needed, workout can be done in small room with limited space, no crazy music (even the piano can be turned off in the options), workouts can be done in a 1 hour session or broken up into 10-15 minute target workouts, Hard enough to challenge the strongest athlete but simple enough my five year old daughter can do it.

Cons:  I would have liked to see more stretching and warm-up in the beginning and a stretching and cool-down at the end.  A simple Barre routine would have been nice and would have made it more ""Ballet."" A segment on nutrition would have been nice too. Still I give it 5 stars.

Tip: 60-min video 3 days a week, two 15-min Blast on alternating 3 days with a two-mile run or 2.5 mile speed walk and you will find yourself in great shape.

Highly recommend this set for everyone and anyone.  I will buy more MHB DVDs as they come.  Waiting for the book as well.",1336348800,19,1215,4.216450216450217
4978991,5,B0068O312Q,"I have never been so compelled to write a review for a product. But I am the person that reads all the reviews whether 300 or 1000 of them before I purchase anything. When I was looking at this product on recommendation from a friend, I read all of the reviews. But the convincing point was when my friend could not lift her arms after only completing 7 of the 15 min swan arms. I purchased it, and have done the swan arms work out twice. I am not in the best shape and was relieved to see that this was not a strenuous or high impact workout with a bunch of people in the video and cheesy music. Mary Helen is very classy, soft spoken, and positive. It is only her and the option of the classical music in background. This makes it easier for you to follow along. I will say that when I first popped in the swan arms video and did the first couple of minutes ...I thought ""this is easy"" That all changed in a couple of more minutes, the burn kicked in and I finished the 15 while stopping intermittently. Having done it twice now, I can see a difference in how my arms feel and tonight I braved the ballet blast butt part 1 and it was intense. I will continue to use these videos and highly recommend them to anyone that is looking to get back into exercise. I like that you immediately feel that it is working. I will update this after a couple of more weeks of use..but do yourself a favor this product has perfect reviews, it is for a reason. I would give 10 stars if I could. It is not ballet lessons but conditioning that is deceptively intense without being in your face strenuous.",1336003200,15,1588,4.175895765472313
4978992,5,B0068O312Q,I purchased both DVDs and enjoy them very much.  This is a really neat and engaging workout routine that I will definitely stick with.  It also is helping me with my ballet classes.,1335225600,3,181,4.454545454545454
4978993,5,B0068O312Q,Really tough at first but results are fast... like 2 weeks fast. I just wish she would have elaborated on stretching more. But still. Love it!,1334102400,7,142,4.5
4978994,5,B0068O312Q,"Ballet Beautiful with Mary Helen Bowers is a wonderful workout because you come away feeling like you've achieved something in the hour you spent working out.  This is a difficult workout.  Mary Helen works each muscle group to fatigue.  The exercises are more ballet conditioning than ballet practice so someone whom is new to ballet won't have a problem, but this program is not for someone who is just starting to workout, it is very strenuous.  You will see your muscles begin to build up and elongate almost immediately!",1329350400,31,525,4.865168539325842
4978995,5,B0068O312Q,"Utilizing real ballet moves (like those from Swan Lake for 'Swan Arms' workout), you are taken through low impact workout routines that are both enjoyable and stenuous - you can feel all the different muscles you've working immediately!

Definately not a high energy, bouncing around workout - but ideal for those looking for something a little different, relaxing (with classical piano and soft instruction), yet difficult enough to push anyone to the next, leaner level!",1329264000,21,472,5.293333333333333
4978996,5,B0068O312Q,"First, let me say one thing: I hate working out.

However, seeing as how I've gained more than I care to admit here, I finally decided that it was time to jump back on the exercise bandwagon. I wanted to try and find a fun workout that I would actually enjoy doing, so after the new year started, I ordered about 5 different exercise videos. I bought yoga, bollywood dance workouts, Zumba, etc....and I purchased this set. I decided to purchase the set because both videos had really great reviews, and it was cheaper to buy this set than to buy both of them separately.

Mary Helen Bowers: You are my idol. I LOVE these workouts! I ended up giving away the other videos I purchased because I could never quite get into them like I could this workout.

Not only is it fun, it's difficult (but in a good way). I definitely feel my muscles screaming the next day, but I know that this means the exercise is working. So far I've lost 7 lbs in 3 weeks and I feel stronger and healthier. I do the classic 60 minute workout about 4 times a week, and I alternate with the 15 minute blasts every once in a while. The other three days I hop on my exercise bike just to keep my workout varied.

Things I love about this video:

1. No weird music, just a nice classical piano playing in the background.
2. The entire focus is on Mary Helen Bowers...there aren't three people behind her doing the exact same thing.
3. She does 4 reps of each exercise, and she encourages you to take breaks if you're a beginner. I started out with 2 reps and worked my way up to 4.
4. I can do this workout pretty much anywhere.
5. I can definitely see a difference in my body after only a few weeks!

Cannot express how happy I am with this purchase. If you buy it, remember to stick to it and don't worry if you can't do all of the exercises the first time...I couldn't either, but now I can do all of them.

I really hope MHB continues to put out more exercise videos!",1329091200,72,1942,4.190348525469169
4978997,4,B0068O312Q,"Pros: Calming piano music, serene instructor, great moves for a rounded bikini-ready bottom and sleek inner thighs

Cons:  Chances are you have done many of these exercises (pushups, bicycle crunches, classic crunches, bridge, etc) before.  Also, I would have liked more instruction in the two ""Blast"" kick series.

Classic workout:  Broken into fifteen minute segments, the DVD consists of a bridge series with variations, inner-thigh leg lifts, outer thigh leg lifts, a plie series, and a surprisingly effective arm routine.  Repetitive arm movements without weights target the triceps--the ""flicking"" motion looks easy but the next morning you wake up sore!

Blast: Seems an intermediate continuation of the first dvd.  For thirty minutes, on the hands and knees in neutral spine, you will perform various back kicks, side kicks, and leg raises (think varied ""donkey kicks"" with control and intention). The ""Swan arms"" section is kitschy fun and causes a burn in the shoulder, bicep and tricep.  The last section mixes crunches, bridge, and pushups.",1355702400,,1052,5.365853658536586
4978998,5,B0068O312Q,"Note:  This is not a lesson in ballet and it contains very few actual ballet moves!!  This is a workout designed by a former professional ballerina to help us to get the look of a dancer's body.  I believe she created this workout during and after her ballet career to help her keep/get in shape.  When I first watched the Classical 60 minute workout, I thought, well this will be a breeze.  NOT!  When I actually followed the workout, not only could I not finish all the repetitions, but my muscles were ON FIRE (and I thought I was ""in shape"" HA!).  Don't let her sweet smile fool you; you will be challenged.  This is a great workout that targets all those muscles we want to tone up.  I do feel it is gentle, i.e. low impact (which is what fooled me into thinking it would be a breeze).  Thus far, I've only made it thru the Classical 60 minute workout (well, as best as I can) and it felt like a Pilates workout with a ballet spin.  I love Pilates as well, so I was pleased with this aspect.  I plan to use this three days a week alternating with my wogging (jogging/walking) to mix things up a bit.  I'm short and chunky and this seemed like a perfect solution to help me get the ""long"" muscle toned look and not ""squat"" look I get from regular weight lifting.  Personally, I do recommend buying her book ""Beautiful Ballet"".  It stands alone (it is beautifully written and photographed), however, it does go thru each exercise in detail.  This video goes a bit fast but she encourages you to stop often and stretch.  I used the book to make sure I was using correct form, but the chapters on mindset and diet were very helpful.  I also watched the ""Blast"" video and it seemed like a good alternative if you are crunched for time.  I also noticed she has a video of the same name on Amazon with a different photo.  I researched this and found out that it was the Classical 60 minute workout, just packaged for mass marketing.  So, if you just want that workout (in lieu of buying both the 60 minute and Blast) you have that option.  Good luck!",1347235200,2,2048,4.306282722513089
4978999,5,B0068O312Q,"I started working out with Mary Helen through her DVDs in June, 2012 after about a year off from a regular routine of pilates.  The effects were amazing.  At first, the Classic 60 Minute workout was quite challenging.  I made sure to include this DVD as a part of my routine every other day.  I began to see results immediately.  As I progressed through gaining strength in this workout, I can say that the bridge work would nearly make me cry from the burn - especially the one-legged bridge.  The arm workout, including swan arms, is so effective without putting a dumbell in your hands.  However, the feeling of completing the routine each day was so rewarding, it became addictive. With each workout with Mary Helen, I felt myself getting stronger and able to effectively complete more of the workout.

I continued throughout this summer to alternate through Mary Helen's DVDs and her online streaming short videos.  I appreciate that the classic 60 minute workout is all done on the floor.  It makes a nice alternating workout for some of the other ballet inspired workouts that I do, including more recently Physique 57 with Tanya Becker (also amazing and body altering!), Element Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan (wonderful), Barre 3 with Sadie Lincoln (she has great online streaming videos on her mybarre3 website), Tracey Mallet's Booty Barre for Beginners & Beyond, and my old time favorite, Winsor Pilates.

Thanks to Mary Helen, my muscle strength and endurance became such that I was able to tackle the P57 Barre workouts with Tanya Becker, which within a week I could see new significant changes in my body.  I make sure to still do Mary Helen's classic workout 3 or more times a week even if I do her workout in the morning and one of the P57 workouts later in the day.  These 2 women (Mary Helen Bowers & Tanya Becker) have become my mainstays.  When I am short on time, Mary Helen's 15 minute total body blast is really a body blast and you can feel it after only 15 minutes!

  I just received MHBs newly released version (Sept. 2012) of the classic 60 minute workout and am anxious to try it out to see what improvements have been made.  I will update.

Mary Helen is beautiful and inspiring!",1346803200,4,2216,4.664948453608248
4979000,5,B0068O312Q,I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase both dvds at the same time. I figured starting off with one would be better. I was glad I decided to get both. Together they provide  me with a way to vary my workout day by day. Being able to choose different sections of both dvds is really helpful to choose the time and type of workout you want to do.,1344470400,,342,3.9565217391304346
4979001,4,B0068O312Q,"In all honesty, I do adore this workout. The movements themselves are exactly what I have been looking for as an alternative for regular-style workouts, like Jillian Michaels (which I have always been a fan of, but now am needing a change). I am confident that these moves will give me the lengthening and strengthening that I want. However as far as the DVD workout itself, I am not a big fan of the very short stretches in between the sets of workout - they last less than 30 seconds and it doesn't feel like you're getting the beneficial stretch that you could if they lasted longer. In addition there is no warm-up to begin the workouts, although that's not really a big problem - I would have just liked to see the warm-up routine Bowers uses as a ballerina. The other main thing I dislike is that in various moves she would speed up the pace of the movements randomly. I found myself going her pace, which was already tough considering the killer moves she had, and then all of a sudden she'd be 1 rep ahead and flying because she decided to speed up. It's highly distracting.

Otherwise the DVD's are both great and I like that its cut in segments, even with the 60-minute classic. It makes it easy to mix-and-match on days when I can't go the full 60-min.",1342483200,,1263,4.420600858369099
4979002,5,B0068O312Q,"This is the first workout program that has been able to hold my attention and keep me interested in continuing! The series sparked my interest because I had always wanted to learn ballet, but didn't get the opportunity. Ballet Beautiful seemed like a cool way to incorporate some of the grace and strength of ballet with keeping fit. I love the Ballet Beautiful program because it is an excellent and challenging workout, and because there is virtually no impact involved in any of the routines on these two DVDs. As a result, I can get a good workout without risking further damage to my joints. The atmosphere of the videos is very soothing and calm--no loud music or shouting, just Ms. Bowers talking and counting accompanied by piano. I have been using this program for a week now (I've done a full hour on 4-5 of the last 7 days) and can already see the results in my core muscles! I have found the videos in the Blast series to be more challenging than the 60-minute routine (don't be fooled--the 60-minute DVD is not easy!), and frankly I am not yet up to the task of doing all 4 Blast videos in one session! So far I do the 60-minute DVD by itself, and one or two days a week I add in one Blast video too. I will say that some of the exercises and demonstrated stretches are difficult to do if you are not flexible (I'm not!) but I still find them effective when utilizing my lesser range of motion. I'm extremely happy with the Ballet Beautiful series and am glad to have heard about it; now I'm thinking of getting the book, too!",1341446400,3,1539,4.384615384615385
4979003,4,B0068O312Q,"As a retired ballerina, I was intrigued by the Ballet Beautiful series and purchased this DVD bundle (by far the best value).

This series is one-of-a-kind. The beautiful classical piano, soft white background, and Mary Helen's prim demeanor immediately transported me back into the ballet studio. I felt relaxed and cleansed, rather than freaked out by kitchsy pump-up music and lots of spandex.

The workouts themselves are EXTREMELY strenuous, especially if you attempt to do the ""advanced"" versions of the exercises that Mary Helen does with seeming ease. However, everything is low-impact so you will feel no strain, just intense muscle burn in places that even I have never felt before. Due to the atmosphere of the video, though, the mind remains relaxed and clear throughout the grueling workouts. A wonderful achievement.

I must admit that Mary Helen does not make the greatest coach. There is little to no encouragement, and her explanations of the exercises are rather sparse. Ballerinas, however, generally don't have much to say, so it's perhaps inappropriate to hold Mary Helen against a professional workout coach. My other critique is that the exercises are rather repetition-heavy; you will find yourself doing the same movement over and over rather than progressing through a series of movements. However, the ballet world favors repetition, so again it may be out of line to hold Mary Helen's workouts against a layperson's.

If you have ballet experience, this video will speak to you in a way than no others do (even the NYC Ballet workout series, which I found to be ridiculously rigorous and over-stylized). If you do not have ballet experience, this video will make you understand why ballerinas are and have always been the most magnificent athletes of all.",1341446400,10,1783,5.137931034482759
4979004,4,B0068O312Q,"I danced (ballet) for 17 years and was hoping to condition my muscles before enrolling in a class (I have not danced in 5 years).  All of the DVD's give me a great workout.  Actually, more of a workout than my body can currently handle.  I hope that by sticking with these routines that I can (again) strengthen & condition my body.  There is only one complaint, many of the floor exercises require strong wrists.  My wrists have muscle damage so it pains me to put pressure on my wrists and to do these particular exercises.  I am trying to find a substitute way to get the same results.",1341446400,,588,4.348623853211009
4979005,5,B0068O312Q,"So, I've gone through a lot of different workout programs with little to okay success: running, cardio at the gym, random boot camp exercises, pilates.  Ballet Beautiful is the first one I've found that actually works for me, and that I enjoy enough to stay consistent with and actually commit to.  The exercises on these dvds are very specific and highly targeted, and they will exhaust the different muscle groups being focused on.  Although this makes the workout pretty difficult and sometimes intimidating, what is awesome is that it means they're actually working.  I've seen results from doing the workouts on these dvds that I've never seen before.  That being said, you won't learn any actual ballet from this program; it's ballet conditioning, so it's exercises that will sculpt the body and build lean muscle, but you won't be doing any actual ballet, or need any dance experience whatsoever to enjoy the workouts.

As far as the dvds themselves, they are very simple but do the job.  The Classic Workout is 60 minutes long but divided into sections so you can do it all at once or just do whichever segments you want (arms, inner thighs, outer thighs, abs, etc).  The Blasts are great because they're only 15 min and you can pick and choose which ones to do of those, too.  I like that you can mix and match the different workouts so you're not doing the same dvd sequence each time, which for me makes it more fun to do these workouts regularly.  You don't need any equipment, either, just enough space for a sticky mat.  This set is a great value and you won't regret starting this program, I recommend Mary-Helen Bowers' book as well.",1341100800,5,1649,4.690972222222222
4979006,5,B0068O312Q,"I have viewed the videos and bought the book to go with it and think its a great combo. The video's content says you don't need any dancing experience and it hold to be true. I myself found it very challenging and not easy at all. I think thats a little reminder that its working very well. :) The fact that I have no dancing experience though  has made me considering dancing classes for the fact that my flexibility is improving. So far I've done about 15 minutes a day. I know not much,but do trust me when I say my flexibility has increased. Yay!",1340841600,2,550,4.238095238095238
4979007,5,B0068O312Q,"Tough, legs will be on fire but completely worth it. It's not ballet, but movements that are similar to ballet training and taught by an amazing teacher. Mary Helen really comes across as a ""real"" person and is welcoming.
I completed 10 years of ballet training and haven't found a workout that creates the same workout as ballet...this does. I highly recommend it.",1340668800,2,365,4.809523809523809
4979008,5,B0068O312Q,"I love these video, I've done the Classic Workout several times now and I liked it enough to also purchase the ""Blast"" series which is also great. The moves are targeted and effective, the production value is high, and Mary Helen is easy to listen to. I like it when she says ""Take a moment, have a sip of water"" between the moves. I actually do take a sip of water. It's so relaxing. Anyway, the moves are easy to do as a non-dancer (I've never danced before), and while she does use a few ballet terms, the video is easy to follow. There are a few moments when I felt the moves became aerobic, but the vast majority of it is low-impact toning done on the mat.

One thing, she stretches for only a moment or two between sets, and I prefer to hold stretches longer. This is easily remedied by having the remote near your mat and pausing as needed. It does extend the workout time, however.",1339891200,,889,4.260355029585799
4979009,4,B0068O312Q,"Purchasing this set was my first experience using Mary Helen's workouts, and I really like them.  The soothing classical piano music, the lovely white set, and Mary Helen's soft voice make for two workouts that are pleasant -- even while Mary Helen is killing you!  These might look easy, but they are tough!

The full-body Classic workout runs at about 55 minutes, and it works your body from head to toe.  I liked this Classic one better than the Blasts DVD, which includes four fifteen-minute segments, one focusing on swan arms, one on the entire body, and two Butt Blast series.

If you are familiar with Tracey Anderson's workouts, the two Butt Blast segments reminded me a lot of Tracey's Metamorphosis Hipcentric workout, where you work your legs from an all-fours position.  I got great results using Tracey's Hipcentric before I had to stop it due to back strain, but because Mary Helen uses slower pacing, her workout seems much easier on my back.  I do have some wrist pain when doing these two segments, but Mary Helen says that you can go down to your forearms if you need to.

For each exercises, you will do four sets of eight repetitions.  Mary Helen counts each and every rep, which some people might not like.  I liked being able to count down with her on the Classic workout, but, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, it was a little more annoying to me on the Blasts DVD.  She also repeats the same phrases, and I could see how that might get old after a while.

Someone had told me that she got great results in her legs and rear end (my personal problem areas) doing these a few times a week, so I'm going to start using them every other day, and will report back on my results.

4979010,5,B0068O312Q,"I have been doing these workouts for about 2.5 weeks now, and I have to say, the results are already amazing. I am totally addicted to Ballet Beautiful and the lifestyle that MHB inspires with the videos, the BB site, and her new book (which is absolutely fantastic). I am in my early twenties, and was pretty active pre-BB, but the areas that these videos target are parts of my body I have never worked before.

I had to take three days off because of an unrelated injury, and I missed it so much! This was a very strange feeling, because I typically dread monotonous workout videos that feature a boring trainer and a group of bored people doing the movements behind her. MHB does all of the workouts right along with you, and I love hearing her feel the same burn that I do at times (especially the Butt series, holy s***!).

I have never been flexible (I am a cyclist and a runner with terrible and inconsistent stretching patterns), but now I find myself stretching ALL day - while making breakfast, in the shower, reading...it is so fantastic, and I have never felt looser. My posture and running form have both drastically improved. I really hope that MHB continues releasing DVDs and streaming videos, although what I have now is more than enough to keep my satisfied.

In a week I typically do 1 hour of BB five-six days a week (alternating the classic and the blast series) and 45 minutes of cardio (running) 3 days a week. On the days that I don't run I try to work in the cardio from the streaming series on the BB website. Since starting, I have dropped 4 pounds and my legs and arms are already appearing longer and leaner. I didn't intend to lose much weight with this program, so it was a bit of happy surprise.

All in all, if you are debating whether or not to buy this, GO FOR IT!! If you stick with it (because some parts are really challenging at first), you will be amazed at how quickly your body transforms. I do just have one tiny complaint: one of the arm workouts features a position in reverse plank with your hands facing the wall behind. I don't know if I just have weak/sensitive wrists, but this is really painful for me. I just do the normal reverse plank instead. The rest of the workouts are very low impact while being extremely effective. Love it!!",1339891200,12,2286,4.422802850356295
4979011,5,B0068O312Q,"These workouts are amazing! I am a college student, in good shape (or at least I thought I was before doing these workouts), doing a full hour of cardio at least 5 days a week at my gym. I needed a workout to tone up my body besides the usual squats, lunges, crunches etc. so I decided on this after seeing how Mary Helen Bowers helped Natalie Portman get ballerina ready for Black Swan. During my first classic 60 minute workout, I could BARELY get through it. I couldn't believe it!!! Just when you think you're done, nope, there's more! I don't think I've ever felt such a burning sensation. I was walking funny the rest of the day. The next day, I did a blast series workout. It was more manageable than the 60 minute only because of the shorter time frame. You will still feel the burning sensation you would from the classic 60 minute workout. Again, I was walking a little funny the rest of the day. If you want to challenge your muscles using only your own body weight, this is the perfect workout for you. Tip: try to stretch throughout the day after you do these workouts or make sure to stretch before you go to bed or you will be even more sore in the morning than you would be had you stretched.",1339113600,7,1208,4.279475982532751
4979012,5,B0068O312Q,"I bought this DVD because I just got tired of pounding my body with jumps, kicks, weights, etc., and not looking as ""shredded"" as I think I should have, and instead of feeling lean, I felt kinda thicker. I thought to myself, ""who looks long, lean and toned?""  A dancer right? But in reality, I'm not nearly as coordinated as I would like to be, so the DWTS videos were out of the question. The slow controlled moves of a ballet dancer on the other hand, seemed to be something I thought I could handle pretty easily. I was so wrong. I already own and have done many Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, and other ""tough"" workouts. I even have the endurance to do Amy Dixon's Breathless after an hour of weight training. So when I first watched the 60 minute workout, (I always review a workout before I do it)I thought it was going to be like a soothing, stretching, maybe tone you after a while kind of workout.  Then I did it.  OMG........Believe me, the 60 minute workout is in NO WAY an easy workout. This seemingly innocent, soft focus, pretty ballerina workout wanted to make me cry in pain after a short while.  I literally was disgusted with myself while trying to keep up with her moves. My cardio endurance and weight lifting that I regularly do was of no help to me while I was trying to keep what felt like 500 pound legs off of the floor.  I LIKE IT!! You will feel your muscles burning, burning bad. You may even have to stop a few times because your legs feel like lead. I did.  Oh yes, so will your arms, and you won't even have a dumbbell in your hand! If you are looking to really make your body transform, without jumping, kicking and punching, get this video. Just for the record, I do not know anything about ballet, but I do know what workout pain is, and if you no longer feel challenged in your current routine, try this.

There's not much by way of a warm up and the stretches in between are done very quickly so if you're new at working out or dance, you'll have to pay close attention.  I've done the workout a few times but it doesn't hold my attention too well so I went back to TA and Zumba.",1337299200,,357,3.8767123287671232
4979014,5,B0068O312Q,"This workout is intended to make you ""Ballet Beautiful"".  It is not a ballet DVD.  That being said, it is a great workout.  She does repetitions which really target and tire the muscles.  It is very challenging!  I love having both DVDs with this bundle.  The 15 minute blasts are great for in the morning before work, or for the days when I need a lighter workout.  Even the 60-minute workout is divided between sections (arms, inner thighs, etc.) that you can select from the main menu.  The only equipment you need is a yoga mat.  All of the exercises, with the exception of ""Swan Arms"" in the Blast DVD and the last 10 minutes of the 60-Minute workout are done on the floor.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I wish she spent some time in the beginning with some sort of warm up.  There is not a lot of stretching, so I have to do that on my own before I begin the workout.  I am just now getting back into ballet as an adult and this will help me achieve the look I want with my body.  If you want long, lean muscles this is the workout for you.  If you are looking for barre work or ballet routines, keep looking.",1337299200,6,1136,4.1045454545454545

8494889,2,B0068O312Q,This DVD set is really hard.  Even the experienced ballerina doing the exercises is straining to do them.  They have very little to do with ballet - more like a strenuous workout to keep a ballerina in shape.,1378166400,,208,4.447368421052632
8494890,5,B0068O312Q,"This is great for someone who has never studied ballet, but also if you have and just want to get back into ballet shape.  The exercises are easy to follow, but not necessarily easy to do at first (hence it is great to get you in shape).  If you are (or want to be) a dancer, this is not a substitute for barre work in class, but it will help to get you in shape enough to be able to keep up with a class.",1376092800,,405,3.7529411764705882

8494892,4,B0068O312Q,"I saw mixed reviews on this set, so I was reluctant to purchase the two DVDs until I saw the special offer of $20 for the both of them.  Unfortunately, I think you now have to buy the workouts separately.  I was really pleasantly surprised at the Ballet Beautiful set.  While the set set does not give you a lot of traditional ballet class/barre movements, Mary Helen Bowers has created a deceptively tough and effective muscle-toning workout that is at the same time beautiful and elegant.  In fact, everything about these workouts are beautiful and elegant - the clean, simple lines of the studio she filmed in, the instructor's lovely body lines and execution of the movements, the inclusion of classical music, etc.  Of the two, the Blast series was my favorite, as I felt it was the toughest and most comprehensive total-body workout of the two DVDs.  Swan arms, although a bit repetitive, was nonetheless really felt in my upper body the following day.  However, the Classic 60-minute workout is a very nice complement to do on alternate days.",1360195200,,1049,4.794444444444444
