8176945,3,B000ND91OU,"I think old-school ideas about marianismo still dominate some people's ideas of Mexico.  Books, TV shows, and films, all particularly old suggest that Mexican women are always virgin until marriage, only get with their husbands, and always exemplify sexual purity.  This film works in shattering that stereotype.  Here we see Mexicans of both genders thinking nothing of pre-marital or extramarital relations.  This has all the spice and hotness of a ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty.""
I don't know why, but I've seen a lot of film that involve love triangles lately.  This film wasn't Sedgwickian, but maybe a more well-versed reader would say otherwise.  Most of the characters have good and bad traits and it's hard to root for any of them.  One character returns from the US, possibly illegally, and he is not celebrated for his time up north, but critiqued for it.  Anti-immigration advocates may be thrilled to see that.
This film was titillating more than explicit.  For people who likes hints, rather  than the real thing, that'll be good, but since I like the latter, it frustrated me.  There is very little nudity, but some stuff straight from Kama Sutra.  Still, at one point you see opposite-sex navels colliding with each other.  Some will find this movie incredibly heat-inducing.
An emerging feminist cause is fighting domestic violence in the workplace.  Many people assume that just happens at home and behind closed doors.  But when husbands constantly call work, or show up at wives' offices drunk,  or do things to sabotage a woman's career, that is a type of misogynist violence.  Perhaps this film, with its related scene, will cause viewers to become active in fighting that tragedy.
The surprise of the title does not come until the very end.  So you must watch the whole thing if you want to be fully informed.",1258243200,,1823,4.940789473684211
