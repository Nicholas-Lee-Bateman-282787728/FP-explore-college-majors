8228231,3,B000XG9Q74,"Jr. High School Student Wataru and his friends like playing in an abandond building and looking for ghosts. However it seems he is not the only one. Another mysterious student Mitsuru shows Wataru that there is a magical door to another world where one can go and get the Goddess of Fortune to grant one wish! When tragedy strikes Wataru's family he decides to open the door for himself. Along his journey he meets many new friends and tries to find out why Mitsuru is destroying everything in their same quest.

Brave Story is aimed children who are about the same age as the character Wataru. He is an overly excitable, somewhat selfish boy who despite being somewhat of a klutz, has a decent heart.

The animation is nothing spectacular and while the story is fairly decent, its obvious there is moral message about growing up and not being selfish.

While most people will get the story, the ""voyage of self discovery"" aspect isn't spelled out all that clearly. There is some Animation violence but mostly against monsters but anyone under the age of 7 might easily be frightened.

Lastly the movie is in THX which helps the film a little. The subtitles are surprisingly good (I speak Japanese so I found a few minor flaws).

Not something to rush out and buy...but if your lucky enough to find a copy its fairly decent.",1217980800,4,1324,4.641025641025641
