8320295,5,B001M1GB2M,"This DVD belongs to a series of DVD of Vaganova Academy of Ballet of St Petersburg Russia which is the best training for classical ballet in the world (it has always been even before Vaganova, in the 19th century. It is extremely interesting to watch this graduation exam of students who will or are already dancing with the Mariinsky Ballet company, the most prestigious in the world. Therefore one congratulates Vladimir Issaev for having obtained the necessary authorizations to have these precious documents filmed. One can only regret that this present DVD on Pas de Deux did not have an oral presentation by the teacher (famous male dancer of the Mariinsky (ex Kirov) Konstantin Zaklinsky. Instead the viewer reads a few paragraphs at the beginning of the tape. It would be very interesting to see a real class of partnering which would make the appreciation of the ""finished product"" even better. It would also have been interesting to have the names of the graduation dancers.  It is beautiful and breathtaking. It looks more like a real performance than a graduation exam !
The perfection of Vaganova schooling is evident at each second.
This DVD is a precious document of transmission of tradition of perfect classical dancing not only for all teachers of classical ballet all over the world but also for all ballet goers and any open-minded audience.
Highly recommended !",1345852800,3,1382,4.982683982683983
