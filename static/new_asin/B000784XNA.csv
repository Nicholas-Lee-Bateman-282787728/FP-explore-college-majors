It starts with the boat ""Liberty"" on the ocean. The man in the crow's nest spots a school of tuna. Bamboo fishing poles are used to catch fish. There is talk about a marriage, but there are family conflicts over Jean's planned marriage (due to ethnic differences). [Note the modern refrigerator in that kitchen.] One sailor shows a roll of bills at the bar, a stranger in a trench coat sees them. A man has too much to drink. One man starts a fight and is led out of the bar. The man in the trench coat hits and robs this man1 Another man, Chris, stumbles into this. Joaquin leads him away. The police arrive, Joaquin Shannon is arrested. [Don't make vain boasts.] The next day there is the wedding between Chris and Joaqin's sister Maria. Will Jean and Joaquin be next? Two detectives bring Joaquin in for questioning, Joe Fenderson died! Joaquin is accused of murder and convicted.

The prison officer tells Joaquin the rules to follow. Cappy warns him. Soapy looks for a ballplayer. We see the inside of the prison. There is another new prisoner. ""Welcome home!"" Big Red suggests a sit-down strike. He has a fight with Joaquin. A week in solitary for both. Joaquin has a visitor, Jean tells of her job at $15 a week. A planted note incriminates Joaquin, he attacks Red and gets two weeks. He is denied parole. Four more years. A telegram brings bad news about an explosion at sea. There is new trouble in the prison. Some convicts have guns and try to crash out. Cappy and Joaquin are forced to walk in front. There is a struggle, Cappy is shot. Joaquin is thanked and given a parole. ""Good Luck!"" Joaquin will work in the cannery. Parole prevents his marriage to Jean. Orders arrive to fire Joaquin. ""Sorry."" Joaquin tries to work on a tuna boat, but his parole prevents him from leaving the state. No other work available. When looking for work Joaquin fails to report to his parole officer, a violation.

A man recognizes Joaquin from prison and buys him a meal. Soapy offers him a job as a skipper of a boat, but this is refused. Outside he resists arrest for parole violation. Now he takes the job. We learn what is really going on! Another robbery in town. Joaquin calls Jean to say goodbye. ""Oh darling."" What are his chances on the outside? Soapy and Big Red board the boat and tell Joaquin to leave the harbor. Soapy tells Jean what Big Red did: the crime for which Joaquin claimed. ""His troubles are over."" There is a fight between Big Red and Joaquin on the boat. Joaquin wins and they return to port. This should result in freedom for Joaquin and a happy ending. [But Joaquin will need to guard his temper in the future.]

This is both a drama about life in the 1930s and a message about the life of a paroled prisoner.",1348876800,,2759,4.468253968253968

Unlike Tracy, the star of this little adventure is also half Irish, a convenience allowing him to speak without any affected ethnicity.

Quite unexpected are the snazzy suits and eye-catching neckties sported by otherwise grimy seagoing types. The cravats are particularly sharp and could be worn by any well-dressed modern man. Fashions aside, this still-popular  UNIVERSAL 'B' unit drama benefits from Ward Bond's excellent bad guy turn.

Here, the stoic Joachin believes he's falling on his fishing gaff for a future brother-in-law, but we all know who actually finished off the unlucky Joe (Edward Pawley) outside that dockside dive! This act of self-sacrifice drastically changes Joachin's life; he's arrested for murder at the wedding of sister Maria (Constance Moore) and Chris (Edmund MacDonald). Joachin's sweety, Jean (Glenda Farrell) believes in him, knows he didn't kill her brother and stays true even when he's sentenced to a five year stretch on ""the Rock.""

In stir, Joachin bonds with elderly cellmate Cappy (Frank Darien) and vows to behave himself so he can obtain an early parole. Speaking of ""bond,"" here is where bad guy Big Red Kincaid (Ward Bond) really gums things up. The San Quentin returnee immediately tries bullying Joachin; they fight and are both given a week's solitary confinement. Big Red targets Joachin from this point on, provoking him and getting the otherwise model prisoner in such hot water that Joachin's parole is denied and he's remanded to serve his full term.

A year later, Big Red takes Joachin and Cappy hostage and attempts the story's titled ""break."" A scuffle ensues with deadly results but Joachin disarms his captor. For foiling the break attempt he's granted a parole that comes with draconian provisions. An otherwise free man, Joachin is not allowed to marry or leave California, which ruins any chance for a good-paying boat captain's post. Fired from a miserable cannery job, he can't find work anywhere and grows despondent.

When old prison acquaintance Soapy (Paul Hurst) offers a captain's position, Joachin doesn't realize that his cargo is the man who's completely ruined his life, a prisoner that's just murdered a guard in his escape, yes, the trench-coated Big Red! We just know an ""explosion"" is imminent, especially when the dying Soapy (shot by Red aboard ship) tells passenger Jean all about Red's past crimes.",1266710400,,3122,5.67237687366167

ALPHA is best known (and perhaps most reliable) of these. RCE's ""top 100 greatest classic films"" editorial appears on all their red box titles no matter how great or dubious a picture may be. They also superimpose a constant and annoying on-screen logo. Like the others, SYNERGY provides no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features.

8045742,4,B000784XNA,"In one of his rare appearances as a lead, Barton MacLane gives what may be his best performance, playing the part of Joaquin Shannon, an Irish-Portuguese tuna fisherman off the Southern California coast who, due to his protection of his younger brother, is wrongfully convicted of manslaughter and sent to prison. The film has an apparent message, i.e., that a parolee has few rights as a citizen, but this takes up little filmic space while the struggle of Shannon to clear his name produces plenty of action, both in and out of the penitentiary, as he must deal with a cruel adversary, Red Kinkaid (Ward Bond) and still find time to woo his sweetheart, played by Glenda Farrell in one of her softer roles. As opposed to today, the Depression era status of released convicts, as this 1938 work demonstrates, proscribed their marrying, and this disappointment in addition to Shannon's inability to find a job propels him into situations which bring about a showdown with the dangerous Kincaid, for whom Shannon unwittingly served his time. Routinely directed by journeyman Arthur Lubin, the film benefits from effective editing by Jack Ogilvie and skillful work by cinematographer Harry Neumann, with scenes varied among commercial ocean fishing, penitentiary life, taverns,and fog-bestrewn docks preventing any slowdown during this rapidly paced movie, although both dialogue and action are marked by clich&eacute; and are somewhat predictable. MacLane's staunch performance is matched in impact by the vigorous Bond, while Farrell, although quick with a quip as ever, is rather winning in her turn as a steadfast paramour; others displaying strong interpretations are Victor Kilian as Farrell's father and Paul Hurst as a convict on the lam.",1132531200,9,1743,5.250896057347671
