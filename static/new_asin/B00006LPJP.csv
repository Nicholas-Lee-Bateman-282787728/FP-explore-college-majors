And just like any other Hamataro DVD, this one is full of fun, adventures, and cute talking Hamsters! I'm a 15 year old and I still love this show so much. <3",1292198400,,295,4.0

7972179,3,B00006LPJP,"I thought Hamtaro was just another Hello Kitty clone, but boy was I wrong. This series is fall-down ROFLMHO hilarious. True, the stories are all at a pre-K to 2nd grade level, and the characters are all unbelievably sweet and nice... but there are moments that will tickle viewers of all ages, even if they profess to be too cool for such unbridled cute. My only complaints are really about the R1 DVD release -  there are only 3 episodes per disc, there's no Japanese track, and it's obvious that some central plot elements have been significantly altered for American audiences, which is just a shame. Hence the 3-star review.",1053561600,8,628,4.709090909090909
