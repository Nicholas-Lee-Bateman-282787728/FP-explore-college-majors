6600930,2,B00MU1YERC,"I used to be one of the biggest fans of Deep Purple. In the US anyway.  It has been more and more difficult over the last years.

It really has turned into some autopilot rippoff on part of D.P.'s record company. ""New"" releases with worse and worse production quality are put out. No new songs, the old songs not played differently. Even the orchestra doesn't do anything that all the other orchestras didn't do playing the same songs last time.

Now, look at the prices they want to charge for the warmed up soup. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this. I feel very sorry for Steve Morse in particular who is sometimes incorrectly blamed for this state of affairs. I wouldn't have a problem with the music being stale, but the record company turning it into a ripoff? No.

I mean this particular release is at least a bit more value than what they do with Jon Lord's legacy which is outrageous and he can't defend his fans anymore since he passed away. So two stars sound OK overall.",1415232000,10,983,4.444444444444445
6600931,3,B00MU1YERC,"I am a massive Deep Purple fan...I have countless dvd releases of all lineups.  I probably have the most featuring the Steve Morse era with equal amounts of Jon Lord (RIP) and Don Airey.  This blu ray release / concert is pretty much the same band as Live at Montreux with orchestra 2011, it's not spectacular yet it is no dud by any stretch. It's Deep Purple 21st century beautifully filmed at an awesome outdoor ancient coliseum. But lately if you've seen Deep Purple in the last 10 years you really aren't hearing anything new.  I picked up for $10.00 (dvd).  Will it get repeated viewings?  Maybe once every couple of years, just like all the rest.",1414972800,14,652,4.538461538461538
8674527,5,B00MU1YERC,"Great Live DVD, I like everything about this DVD, except they put the encore in a different section, it was a little confusing at first, but once I figured it out everything was ok, I had seen this tour when Deep Purple came to New York and played at the Beacon Theatre, the band sounded great, loved the set list, the encore songs were Hush and Black Night, the amphitheatre was beautiful and the orchestra were very good, I recommend picking up this DVD.",1472428800,2,456,4.440476190476191
8674528,1,B00MU1YERC,"Terrible Audio production.

Another victim of the loudness wars with weak bass and harsh top-end.  WAY too much dynamic compression...a waste of Blu-ray lossless audio.",1470096000,3,168,5.68

8674530,5,B00MU1YERC,"This is a concert video of Deep Purple in an amphitheater with an orchestra playing behind them.

It's basically Deep Purple's regular concert set with orchestral support. The sound is good and video is well shot and well edited. The band members are all in their 60s now but they still put on a really good show.

If you're a Deep Purple fan this one is well worth adding to your collection.",1445558400,,392,4.430555555555555

8674534,2,B00MU1YERC,"I pre-order this blu-ray and after watching just 1 time, I conclude that it is very disappointing. In an attempt to catch up with time and to give audience something new and fresh, they add the orchestra which is absolutely unnecessary because Deep Purple is a rock band and they have to perform in an authentic way.

Get yourself a chance to watch the ""Live in concert 72/73"" or ""Perfect Stranger Live"" to see how pure they are in rocking the stage with no gimmick but pure music. I see no reason for me to follow through the band as this album, in my opinion, marked a closed chapter and retirement for the band.",1426032000,4,614,4.385964912280702
