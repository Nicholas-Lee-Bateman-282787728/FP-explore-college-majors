528772,5,6302969263,"This movie will delight fans of the British Ealing comedies of the post-WW II era and also Alec Guinness fans.  It's not as well-known or as slick as ""The Lady Killers"" or ""The Man in the White Suit"" and hasn't been issued in NTSC disc format since the old laserdisc edition under its U.S. title of ""The Promoter.""  So U.S. customers will need a PAL/NTSC/all-region DVD player, such as the Panasonic DVD-S68.  ""The Card"" is based on an Arnold Bennett story about a spunky young man from a poor working-class family who rises to wealth and power by using his wits, not worrying too much about scruples, and never passing up an opportunity to advance--at someone else's expense if necessary.  The women in his life, other than his gruff mom, include Gwyneth Johns and Petula Clark before she gained fame as a singing star.  Though some of the humor is pretty broad, this is an intelligent movie, not a sappy British farrago like, say, the St. Trinian's, Carry On, or Frankie Howerd series.",1355270400,4,987,4.682080924855492
528773,4,6302969263,"""The Card"" is the original British title for a film released in the US as ""The Promoter""; it is one of Alec Guinness's best performances made during his great British comedy years, the 1950's. Based on a novel by Arnold Bennett entitled ""The Card"" or ""Denry the Audacious"" (in the US) it is the story of a young man who finds success and fortune come to a man who makes his own opportunities.  For some reason this has not yet been released on DVD (and may never) so I would encourage all Guinness fans to get the videotape.

PS: A DVD of this movie is available for 7 Pounds from Avalon.co.uk; it is region 2, but that's a reason to own an all region dvd or Blu Ray player.",1272672000,,674,4.217054263565892
528774,5,6302969263,"This is one of Alec Guiness's best comedies - nice to have it back in my collection.

528775,3,6302969263,"Alec Guinness was one of the best actors of his day and this movie displays this well. In this is he plays a dishonest promoter. But his character is likable and not malicious. He starts out at the beginning as a worker at a morgage company and at the end is a mayor. Along the way you see the mischievous ways he builds himself to the top.

Glynis Johns is especially good as a gold digger he meets. His reply to her about her gold digging is very amusing. Other than Alec the second reason I got this was because it stars a very young brunette Petula Clark. Unfortunately her character is under developed.

The Promoter is not in the league of his other movies like Last Holiday and The Ladykillers but it's enjoyable.",1098316800,8,720,4.365671641791045

528840,4,6302969263,"In my opinion, the best of Alec Guiness's early British comedies.  The rest of the cast is also excellent: Glynis Johns, Valerie Hobson, Petula Clark, and even a cameo appearance by Joan Hickson.

528841,3,6302969263,"No question Great Britain lost the flower of its manhood in World War I, and lost more than the flower the second time around in World War II since it irrevocably and clearly lost it hegemonic position in the world capitalist order. In short the nation was placed on rations for a fairly long time afterward. (It has been remarked that the reason for the emaciated fashion model look, the Twiggy look, of the early 1960s reflected those ration diets for the post-war generation young women, along with the angry young men and the loneliness of the long-distance runner.) All this to say that cinematically, at least in the film under review, The Card, the British film industry seemed to have been rationed as well long after Hollywood was working its way back to Technicolor spectacles. The black and white production values here detract from the story line and give it a washed out feeling that I don't think the producers were looking for in a film which was essentially a comic set-up of a Horatio Alger-story-British-style.

Here Denry, (played by Alex Guinness as the Card as in you are a card, meaning clever, resourceful willing to take chances rather than funny) played by Alex Guinness is by hook or by crook determined to make something of himself despite his lack of formal educational smarts and, important for class conscious Britain then, and now, a benighted son of a mere widowed washer woman. Naturally in a dog eat dog world a guy like the Card to if not cheat, or just a little, play his cards very close to the vest, has to take advantage of the main chance the same way his betters  did to get where they were (or where their forbears were and they piggy-backed off of that success).

So from a lowly nowhere clerk in a municipal office of one of the industrial Five Towns at the end of the 19th century he finds after he is dismissed from that position for impertinence by the stuffy boss (after setting himself up to attend the bigwig local ball through fair means or foul) he begins to take on a job nobody wanted, at least wanted enough to undercut the boss who had previously done the work, the rent collector in cold-draft tenement rich Bursley. From there it is just a matter of taking care of business, adding on and developing new ideas like a thrift club so people, in pre-credit card times, could purchase items by saving up for them.

Yes, a young man on the move indeed. One who also had political aspirations finally consummated after luring the towns best football player (soccer in the USA) back to led the town previous non-descript team to the big cup. Gets him the honor of being the youngest mayor in town history. Oh yeah and in the end a fetching wife with whom he had been friends with while pursuing another young woman (played by Glynis John). Not the best Alex Guinness performance by far but okay. What a card.",1438905600,,2859,4.578125
528842,3,6302969263,"It was Friday evening.  I needed something simple and fun to watch.  With Alec Guinness, Glynnis Johns and Petula Clark in it, what's not to like about The Card?  This movie doesn't have the comedic bite of Kind Hearts & Coronets or The Man in the White Suit, but it's still a good one.  Glynnis Johns is great as the scheming piano teacher.  Alec Guinness's character is also a schemer, but overall has a good heart and tries to help people.  Petula Clark has an almost non-existent role, but what the heck... they didn't know Downtown was just 13 years away.  Watch it on an evening when you're feeling tired and lonely and need to forget the workday worries....",1430611200,,664,4.529411764705882

528938,5,6302969263,"First I should say that I saw this film on VHS under the American title ""The Promoter"" - although the U.K. title is what shows on the screen. I had seen it once before on television and was struck by something unique about it. This is the only movie I can think of which shows how to make money. In other films, people just have money, or they find it, or they steal it. If someone in the film makes money, he makes it off screen and you never really find out how. Either that or he makes it in such a fantastic way that it could never happen in real life. But here we see Guinness' character from childhood as the only son of a washerwoman, and by the end of the film he is rich, respected, and the mayor of his city. The wonder of this film is that we actually see HOW this happens  - and how it all could happen in reality.
Isn't it strange that money is such a big part of life but how to make it is treated like a dirty secret? You can see every sex act you can imagine (and quite a few that you can't) in some movie. You can see other planets and other dimensions. But you never see how someone poor can make himself rich - not through winning a game show or a lottery or idiocy like that, which is just to trick the poor into staying poor. It's as if there's a conspiracy between people who think the rich got their money from God, and bleeding hearts who think the poor are so beaten down that they could never in a million years lift themselves up.
This movie ought to be shown to young people everywhere on earth. It teaches the lesson that there is no limit to how high you can rise up ON YOUR OWN.",1398816000,4,1609,4.012461059190031

528940,3,6302969263,"I love Alec Guiness but I confess that I found this film to be a little slow and silly.  Despite some good performances, including that of Glynnis Johns, I had a hard time sticking with it.  It took me two nights to get through it.  Guiness plays the sweet, likable character we have all come to love.  If you are a die-hard fan you might enjoy this.  Just don't expect the quality of films for which he is most loved.",1373673600,,418,4.175
528941,5,6302969263,"Really a comic treasure.  If all you know of Guinness is Star Wars and Shakespeare, give this one try.  Lavender Hill Gang, Our Man in Havana, and The Card, Sir Alec was a comedic ""everyman"" reaching for success with outlandish results/consequences.",1357257600,2,249,5.048780487804878

7833174,5,6302969263,"I have seen this film several times, the first time by accident, anticipating a fall-down-on-the-floor Guinness comic turn. No, it is a warm, cheery chronicle of a young man with a knack for turning a dime in the worst of circumstances, and making everybody around him happy in the process. Made in the depths of the British Labour government's nationalizing everything in sight, it is a film about, ta-da . . . Capitalism! It is about an entrepreneur who can make money by giving people things they never knew they wanted, like automobiles, or television, or facebook at a price that suits them ... and getting rich in the process and having everybody love them. Its like the knack for painting great art or composing music.  What a concept! Thank you, Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.",1476748800,,806,4.798561151079137

7833176,3,6302969263,"(If it were possible, I would have given it 3.5 stars.) The Card is a pleasantly innocuous RomCom whose characters are all likable. The problem is, from an American viewpoint, is that there isn't enough conflict to overcome, and the conflict which is there, presents too small a hill to overcome. Also, although Alec Guinness' character Denry Machin does end up with the right person, there was never any obstacles that he had to overcome. However, I did enjoy it, and if you enjoy British cinema, I would recommend it as a pleasant evening's diversion.",1465776000,,553,4.831578947368421
