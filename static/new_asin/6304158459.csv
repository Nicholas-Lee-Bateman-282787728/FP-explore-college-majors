7864355,4,6304158459,"Ranma 1/2 still holds up very well even today against newer anime. I really enjoyed my tape. my only small grip is wanting to see more. that and wanting to see more plot archs with a lot of the lesser seen people in the anime. No knock against the anime, I just want more. This is still one of my favorites even today at 28. the dvds are rather expensive so this is a good way to get into Ranma.  your only concern is keeping the transformations straight.",1203811200,,455,4.170454545454546
7864356,1,6304158459,"I love this series, but this volume couldn't be more filler if all three were clip shows.  It was hard to watch; each one recycles characters used before, even to the point of bringing back Tsubasa who appears in one third season episode.  It just amazes me that they made this instead of adapting something from the manga.

In fairness the Miss Beachside episode has some funny moments, and I did pick up on some of the ""Some Like It Hot"" references without the subtitles.  Other parts of it are left unexplained or maybe never made any sense at all.

Overall this is a good series, but it has it's weak moments and it would appear this is one of them.  It might be worth having someone use a screen capture to make a poster - most of the posters I see with this artwork look kind of funny (they're probably bootlegs anyways).  But if you're new to the series, skip this one, unless you'd like to see Tsubasa again.",1171324800,,916,4.352941176470588

7864359,5,6304158459,"Ranma  is one of the most popular anime series of all time.
""Kiss Me, Cat"" is the third DVD released from the seventh, and final season of the Ranma  television series.
The first two episodes are storylines directly from the original mangas of Rumiko Takahashi.
In  ""Shampoo's Curs&eacute;d Kiss,"" The Ghost Cat, Mao-Mo-Lin, is back and he is still looking for his Bri-i-i-i-ide!  Will Ranma be able over come his Ailurophobia long enough to break The Ghost Cat's curse, and save Shampoo from being a cat forever?
The second episode is ""Run Away With Me, Ranma!"" Ranma uses his girl-side to help grant the dying wish of a old man. Very strange, very cool.
The last episode, ""Let's Go to the Mushroom Temple"" is a delightful series original. If you are a big fan of Ranma and Akane hooking-up, you will really enjoy watching this episode, Honey.",1041033600,5,844,4.72108843537415
7864360,3,6304158459,"this video wasn`t to good the first episode is that akane eats super noodles that make her very strong so she can beat conditioner(shampoo,hee hee) that was good and the next episode ranma,conditioner,genma,mousse go  to juesnkyo cause they are punished for some dum reason don`t waste your  money but if like it is your choice buy it for the hard battle collection  but the episodes were like crap",963705600,,398,4.823529411764706
