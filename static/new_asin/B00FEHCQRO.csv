5980054,4,B00FEHCQRO,"Many years ago I watched this movie on HBO.  It appealed to me at the time, mostly I suppose because I liked the stars, and it was a fun way to pass a Saturday afternoon.  Especially if you like movies about mysterious space aliens, and I do.  Now I look forward to seeing it again because I have my own tie to it.  No, I have not encountered aliens, but something happened in New Mexico that gave me that connection.  I was on my way home, traveling on a rural highway in the mountains of New Mexico when I drove into a nearly deserted town that seemed strangely familiar.  Among the few structures I saw there were an old gas station and an old dance hall down the street from it that I was sure I had seen before.

refrigerator within a million acres by satellites, but real life personality types are presented.

5980095,1,B00FEHCQRO,"First: This is a 1981 ""B"" movie directed by Greydon Clark who did a bunch of other B movies. This is a waste of bunch of very good actors in a really lousy alien abduction movie that throws together cattle mutilations, a nasty dog in an old guy's shack and special effects that aren't close to any A-list movie.  It justifiably got 3.1 stars out of 10 by 275 raters on IMDB, though in my opinion 1/5 or 2/10 is still a stretch  If you're a movie buff and want to see an above average analysis of the movie go here: [...] where they gave it two stars but wrote an overly complimentary synopsis.",1461369600,2,593,4.192982456140351

Now for this movie..the cast boasts him, Cybill Shepherd, Martin Landau, Neville Brand and the great Raymond Burr. Now with this caliber of talent (I won't include Cybill as talented, she was always awful in everything, consistently) it would have at the very least been interesting. The acting by all was bad, the story was bad, the ""effects"" were bad and did I mention the acting was bad? The supporting cast was even worse. I know it was 1980 but that doesn't excuse everything...did I mention the acting was bad?

8614822,5,B00FEHCQRO,"WARNING: Contains scenes of a dead, mutilated cow and gross consumption of under-cooked eggs.

***SPOILER ALERT***

Greydon Clark  the shlockmeister behind MST3K classics, Final Justice and Angels Revenge  released this two years after his other alien opus, Without Warning (1980).

The Return is a strange little film that adds an interesting twist to the unexplained phenomenon of cattle mutilations.

Greydon always stocked his drive-in cheapies with great actors and The Return is no exception.

The cast includes:

Cybill Shepherd
Martin Landau
Jan-Michael Vincent
Raymond Burr
Vincent Schiavelli
Neville Brand

Schiavelli plays the cattle mutilator. He kills with a strange glowing knife provided by the (never shown) aliens.

There's a really creepy scene where Greydon Clark (in a cameo role) stumbles on Schiavelli mutilating a cow in a shadowy gully. Schiavelli's calmness as he kills Greydon is quite unnerving (though Greydon's bad acting eventually lessens the impact of the moment).

Though well executed, the long and mostly silent UFO scenes only serve to pad the running time.

Non-stop scenes of Jan-Michael Vincent drinking seem to have been added as a running gag, but they only induce cringing now (considering his pitiful current state after a lifelong battle with the bottle).

The fantastic cast elevates this from forgettable rubbish to must watch status for connoisseurs of bad cinema.",1530230400,2,1411,5.476851851851852
8614823,5,B00FEHCQRO,"When their respective fathers irresponsibly leave them outdoors one night, two children -Jennifer and Wayne- are hovered over by an alien craft. Scanned by extraterrestrial disco lights, the kids are unaware of the ship's landing a short distance away. There, a prospector (Vincent schiavelli) is zapped, while dramatic music plays. Twenty five years later, adult scientist, Jennifer (Cybill Shepard) heads to Little Creek, New Mexico for the SSR institute. She's there to do research for SSR, which launches satellites. Jennifer has trouble w/ a dog that keeps attacking her. A dog which belongs to the prospector from the beginning! Said prospector is roaming about, in the same coveralls, not having aged at all. Meanwhile, adult Wayne (Jan Michael-Vincent) is now a deputy marshal, chasing hicks and shooting car stereos. Events lead Jennifer and Wayne to remember what happened to them that fateful night. Jennifer's dad, Dr. Joseph Kramer (Raymond Burr) arrives in town, just in time to start pontificating importantly. It seems that the local cattle population is suffering from a mutilation epidemic. Devil cults are suspected by deputy what's-his-name. Enter landowner / rancher, Walt (Neville Brand), who shows up to yell a lot in a gruff voice. He knows his cows! Dr. Kramer has theories of his own. Oh no! The prospector is using his mini-light saber to terminate tourists from a dude ranch, while his freaky dog looks on! All this while Sheriff Buchanon (Martin Landau) tries to figure out how to dunk doughnuts in cans of beer. The hicks act up, and Jennifer is accosted by the world's shortest cowboy. It's clear that alien mischief is behind all this! Dr. Kramer goes back to the SSR facility, so he can bark at his underlings. This does nothing to stop the continuing cow-tastrophe. Can Waynnifer figure out what's going on, before Buchanon dunks his first doughnut? And, what about the prospector and his devil dog? Why are they allowed to have a black hole in their cave? Will Kramer and his subordinates get to town before the prospector turns everyone into cold cuts? Why are the aliens doing any of this? Who knows? Who says it was unnecessary for Jan Michael-Vincent to drive a motorcycle through a window -and a door- in slow-motion? It was the most righteous part of the movie! THE RETURN (aka: EARTHRIGHT, aka: THE ALIEN'S RETURN- 1982) is a riot from beginning to end! Oh yes! You Will Believe! In Alien visitors? No, in the power of love, and doughnuts, and light sabers, and Raymond Burr, and in the ability of Cybill Shepard and Jan Michael-Vincent to float elegantly in black holes! This! Is! their! Des-tin-y! Amen!...",1522022400,,2650,4.984198645598194
8614824,3,B00FEHCQRO,"Not really an abduction story. A couple of kids and an old miner were scanned bay some lights in the sky.

Twenty-fine years later they were compelled by curiosity to return. The story is that of the return and what the locals made of the returning signs.

Very primitive writing and acting. No expensive props or CGI.

Who cares the fun is watching the story unfold is enough.

I watched this mainly to see the late Martin Landau in a different character.

dine like a king, not a drunken jester--that is my motto.

8614828,1,B00FEHCQRO,This movie is quite dated . It was mediocre way back when it was made and only got worse with time .,1477958400,,100,3.590909090909091
8614829,4,B00FEHCQRO,"I enjoyed ""The Return"".  Despite the inaccurate summary, this proved to be pretty good.  The main characters (as children) were not abducted and returned 25 years later.  They were scanned - or something like that - but never left the Earth.  The story takes place 25 years later.  One thing that did bother me for a while was the (insignificant) little fact that she (Cybill Shepard) drove her car into a tree with enough force to set off the car horn (no airbags in those days) but not damage the car.  Just a little thing that a good director might have noticed.

Overall I thought the acting was good, considering the script.  The stand-out actor here - in my mind - was Vincent Sciavelli.  He does the insane bad guy really well.  He just seems so natural in parts like this.  He's probably one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet, but put him in make-up and give him a double-bladed light-knife and he would probably scare the bejeebers out of a whole cell block.

I must admit that I'd seen this before some time ago, but I'll probably still watch it again in a few months once I forget it - it's good enough for a repeat.",1476144000,,1136,4.357142857142857
