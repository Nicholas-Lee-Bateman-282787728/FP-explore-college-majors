8442967,5,B004V4RU7M,"The Secret is the second feature film by director/writer Ian J. Keeney, and, in my opinion, his second best film behind his newest release, The Meaning. The short running time adds to the intensity of this film.

The close spaces in the film add to the claustrophobia that the audience will feel. Like most great independent films, when you see The Secret, you want to go out with your buddies and film your own movie. In fact, after hearing the commentary on the DVD, I realized that ""let's-film-it-ourselves"" mentality was the genesis of The Secret. The writer of the story, Darren Debari, a talented indie filmmaker in his own right, created the story long ago, when he and his friends picked up a camera and set out to create their own movies. Darren's twists-and-turns story along with Ian's intense imagery create a masterpiece of indie filmmaking. The cast is brilliant, led by Gregory Robert Wilson who also appears in some of Ian's and Darren's other productions. We also see two strong performances by Todd Pate and Arnold A. Sidney Jr. who will later turn out even stronger, more intense performances in Ian's third film: ""Cold Blue Eternal"". Overall, The Secret is great entertainment, and should be part of any indie film library.",1410652800,,1243,4.863207547169812
