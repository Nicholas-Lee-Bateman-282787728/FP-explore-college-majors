The instructions are clear and repeated so that I can follow them without having to rewind constantly.

I am also impressed and pleased by how many styles are covered.

This DVD set will give any person the confidence to get on the dance floor.

Thanks to Shawn and Joanna Trautman for such an excellent system that I can learn in the privacy of my home.",1169596800,6,404,4.276315789473684
8457304,5,B000L2BMNG,"This DVD set is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I was getting ready for one of my college friend's weddings and realized that I was going to look like a fool when I would dance at her wedding. Since I would be around friends that I hadn't seen for years, I wanted to make a good impression and blow them away! I bought this pack after buying the Couples Ultimate Dance Sampler and I wanted to get a little more variety in my dances. This was a PERFECT choice! Not only were these DVDs fun and exciting, but they got me ready in no time. The pictures from the wedding were posted in the alumi magazine, so I must have made a big splash! These DVDs are worth every cent and I recommend them to everyone!",1168387200,7,686,4.204545454545454
