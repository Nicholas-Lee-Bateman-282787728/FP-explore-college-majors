8162527,2,B000LP5CXE,"Crooked (AKA Soft Target) is a film from late in Don Wilsons prime career  that is, from before his hiatus around the turn of the decade. Overall, it goes to show that it wasn't a bad time for him to take a break, not necessarily because he no longer had the stuff but because the DTV action circuit seemed to have left him behind. The movie is weak sauce, for despite its strong supporting cast, its lacking in style and substance. Ill say it now: this ones for completionists, only.

The story: Two police detectives  Tyler (Wilson) and Yordan (Olivier Gruner)  are assigned to protect a witness to an underworld murder (Diana Kauffman), but their efforts are hampered by internal corruption.

The films primary selling point is its cast, which also includes Gary Busy, Martin Kove, and Fred Williamson. However, don't get your hopes up: while Wilson and Gruner make the most of their team-up, Williamson and Kove have a combined screentime of maybe five minutes and Busey doesnt even get in on the action. Personally, I was expecting this  Martin Kove has particularly been irritating me for a long time with his reluctance to do fight scenes  but it could be very disappointing to someone who thinks theyve come across a B-movie supergroup. Thats not to take away from the memorable performances delivered by lead villain Michael Cavalieri (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Next-Karate-Kid/dp/B00005LK96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Next Karate Kid</a>) and Martin Morales as a flamboyant pimp, and Gary Busy manages to be memorable, but its not what viewers wanted to see.

Speaking of things unwanted, Im sorry to say that the movie is ugly in more ways than one. Production-wise, the movie toes the line of an indie feature. The way its been shot makes me think it had a very rushed schedule: endless nighttime scenes, shaky camerawork, inharmonious editing, and a lot of ADR lines. All of this amplifies the sleazy tone of the story, which really turned me off. Few of the characters are endearing, with Yordan in particular doing all he can for the viewer not to like him. Violence against female characters and sexist dialogue is recurrent. As usual, Don Wisons character is a paragon of morality, but hes on in his own in that regard, amidst all of these other slimy critters. Basically, this isn't the kind of film you watch to put you into a good mood.

The same is generally true for the action content, though it has its redeeming qualities and ends up being the one passable aspect of the film. There are four shootouts and five full-length fistfights, and while the former are overlookable, the latter can be decent. Don Wilson and Olivier Gruner don't fight each other and thats pretty disappointing (especially when the film teases it), but they do fight alongside each other and thats pretty cool. A direct comparison favors Gruner: even though both performers are former pro kickboxers and have been listed among the authentic tough guys of martial arts movies, Wilson plays his fights very safe with relatively slow choreography and a lot of cuts, whereas Gruner performs a more dynamic and rougher-looking style of brawl that more accurately conveys his real-life strength and ability.

Crooked isn't a film for casual martial arts fans. It *might* pass for a slow night on cable, but thats only if you really want to see the two lead stars and are tolerant about shortcomings.",1474761600,,3443,5.003496503496503

8162532,2,B000LP5CXE,"It is with great regret that Sid must inform the B lovers of a Gary Busey film falling flat on it's face. Honestly it had nothing to do with giant toothed Busey's performance, it was more the lack there of. How is it possible to list Busey as one of the main actors when he barely broke 5 minutes open? Crooked would be an appropriate title for what the film actually does to the mass followers of the mental guru. Outside of the minimal Busey appearance this one really didn't have anything to offer out of a few laughs and absolute confusion. Seeing it was released in 2007 was perplexing due the the fact it looked like a late 90's straight to video. Yeah the type that would have found itself in the ""guaranteed to be here or it's free"" slot late on a Saturday night years ago.

The film opens up with extremely horrible dialogue being spouted by Busey giving us a false sense of excitement. The first scene takes place in a sleazy hotel room with cops Fred Williamson and Tom Brady's brother Dom Brady playing high stakes poker with a pot of $27. That's not a joke either...we counted it, it was $27. While playing one of their buddies Tod Packer's brother (worst actor alive) is in the bedroom with a couple hookers. Just after Shaft wins the big poker match and before Packer gets his rocks off a bunch of masked men burst in and gun fire pops off. The crew is run by the ultimate fake piasan with the worst Italian accent on the market. This loser actually turns out to be the films only source of entertainment outside of the few short lived Busey scenes.

Crooked moves in such clumsy fashion you'd think you were watching Santa try to scramble away from a sack on the B.B.T.S field back in 95. The selling point to even move forward with this one was the promise of a heavy dose of Busey which failed miserably. After 15 minutes of deliberating between a Joe Estavez or Gary Busey B we couldn't have went in a worse direction. It's o.k though, we'll make it up to Uncle Joe and Busey for the film demolishing what could have been a stellar 5 star can of Manwich. Naturally we couldn't recommend this piece to any viewer out there. We love some of the worst cinema on the planet and could barely stomach this...so yeah you should steer clear of Crooked.",1280102400,,2263,4.385714285714286

8162535,1,B000LP5CXE,"I hate to disagree with the other esteemed reviewer of this cinematic nightmare, but it is my duty to inform the innocent viewing audience that this was a completely AWFUL movie.

The dialog was ridiculous, the ""action"" scenes were right out of a Keystone Cops cartoon, the acting was beneath contempt (including some fairly well-known actors who definitely should have known better), and at no time does it rise above the level of a mid-60's soft-core porn movie, which coincidentally it actually becomes once the characters seek refuge at (cliche alert) a ""flight attendant's"" house.

Beware of any movie in which one of the characters has a middle name of ""The Dragon"", especially when he appears to be about 60 years old with martial arts skills that are on par with one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. Beware any movie in which Gary Busey utters the following immortal lines while consoling a guy whose father committed suicide: ""Just look at this as an....(forgetting the script)....an.....what's the word?....(someone says it from off camera) an evolution....of your....your....what's the word? (again from off camera)....your destiny.""  I kid you not. Everyone involved in this wretched production must have been over-medicated or delusional, including the poor devils who put up the money to produce it.

In conclusion. It is so awful as to be laughable, therefore, if you do rent or buy it, do so for its (unintentional) comedy content, definitely not for its drama. It is as Gary Busey would say....uh.....uh....what's the word?.....AWFUL !!!",1187481600,7,1557,5.142292490118577
8162536,5,B000LP5CXE,"This is the best movie anyone has ever made. Gary Busey is at his insane best. I won't ruin the plot for you because I've never seen the movie, but I know it's good because I can feel it. My extra senses are seldom wrong, and after the nurse comes in to clip my toe nails and give me my medicine, I'll write another review.",1186963200,3,323,3.9846153846153847
