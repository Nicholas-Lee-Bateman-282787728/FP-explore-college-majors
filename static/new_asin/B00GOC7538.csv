6095112,1,B00GOC7538,I thought I was buying the 4 hour version but as it turned out it was for only 25 minutes.  It was an overview.  Very sorry I made the purchase.  Not satisfied at all.,1387324800,,167,3.8529411764705883
6095113,5,B00GOC7538,"This historical film is the best I've seen. You will get several historical ""firsts"" in it. It is hosted by Halley Berry and Colan Powel.

8625471,4,B00GOC7538,"Great video but I always get irritated with continuity issues.  WWI veterans are shown coming home while ""We'll Meet Again"" is being sung in the background.  However, that song was not written until 1939.",1518912000,,204,4.970588235294118

8625473,3,B00GOC7538,"I have not read it.  However, I'm sure it will contain a number of references to black soldiers in the War Between the States.  In light of that, I have a few questions.

Which army was not segregated?
Which army had the most black soldiers?
Which army's general was opposed to slavery?
Which army did not attack noncombatants?

If you answered ""the northern army"" to any of these questions, your education is lacking.  If this video does not contain these facts, it is propaganda, not history, promoted by the ""politically correct"".  The motivation leading to the recent removal, defacing, or destruction of Confederate monuments is ill founded.",1505520000,,646,4.990654205607477
