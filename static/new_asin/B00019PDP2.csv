1983762,4,B00019PDP2,"The setting is supposed to be Nevada, but ""The Ponderosa"" has Australia written all over it.  The series was filmed in Victoria, Australia and none other than Simon Wincer, the veteran Australian director of the original ""Lonesome Dove"" mini series and theatrical films like ""Quigley Down Under,"" is in the director's chair for the two-part pilot episode.  A few of the lead actors (Daniel Hugh Kelly and Brad Dourif, most notably) are Americans, but most of the supporting cast and guest cast are Australian, a few of whom are even recognizable to American audiences.  Mark Lee, who co-starred (with Mel Gibson) in Peter Weir's classic World War I film ""Gallipoli"" has a prominent role in one episode as does Lewis Fitz-Gerald, who appeared as one of the court-martialed soldiers in another Australian cinema classic, Bruce Beresford's ""Breaker Morant.""

As to the episodes, there are some liberties taken with the original Bonanza storyline and some of the stories are a bit on the PC, preachy side, but the acting and production values are strong for this series.  In fact, I prefer the town and ranch settings in this series over the original ""Bonanza"" series, which used studio sets more than this prequel series does.  ""The Ponderosa"" also seems to be more mindful of authenticity, as you can see the actor's breaths when they speak in some episodes that were filmed on chilly days and the town's streets are often very muddy after a rainfall.

The 10 episodes in this set are spread over 3 discs (3 episodes on discs 1 and 3; four episodes on disc 2).  The visuals are beautifully rendered on DVD and, in that respect, fans and newcomers (like me) to this series will not be disappointed.  However, it's a bit surprising for such a relatively recent series that no extras whatsoever are included on this set . . .  no interviews, episode commentaries, etc.  I would have been especially interested in seeing some biographies/filmographies for the cast, particularly those Australian cast members with whom I had no familiarity prior to seeing this series.

Fans of TV Westerns have had relatively little in the way of new shows over the last few decades, so even if it comes from the Land Down Under, ""The Ponderosa"" is a welcome addition.  Yee haa, mates!",1147996800,21,2263,4.861979166666667
1983763,1,B00019PDP2,"Don't waste you money on this piece of PC trash disguised as a prequel to Bonanza. The stories are unashamedly chock-full of PC themes.

For example: Ben nearly has a stroke when, on his 21st birthday, Adam expresses a desire to own a gun. Shocking! Ben lets Adam know how displeased he is. Ben says that guns are only used to kill people. By the end of this ep, Adam has embraced Ben's twisted ideology.

Every ep is full of this leftist revisionist thinking. An Indian fighter is derided as the scum of the earth by Ben(let's remember how Inger was killed)..women are given an equal voice in the town government; by the way, the town's name is Eagle Station, not Virginia City.

Besides these faults, Bonanza history is tampered with. Maria is killed in an explosion, instead of falling from a horse. Hoss gets his nickname after Joe's pony bites him on the behind. As for Joe, he's hardly ever seen. Hop Sing's character is unrecognizable.

I have nothing wrong with the actors. Especially the guy who did Hoss--I thought he was perfect for the roll as was the guy for Adam.

I watched this series from the first show to the last show. I was excited about the prospects of a Bonanza prequel, but I was sadly misled and disappointed. Each episode I hoped the writers would start listening to the viewers. They never did. Unless you can overlook this revisionist view of Bonanza, I suggest you save your money.",1122163200,40,1411,4.583333333333333
1983764,5,B00019PDP2,"The Ponderosa is an excellent portrayel of the Cartwright's before they became the rich landowners they were on Bonanza. I have seen every episode. Although the storyline sometime strayed from the original, the show was becoming more Bonanza-like as the season progressed. The actors,Daniel Hugh Kelley,Matt Carmody, Drew Powell,and Jared Daperis did an excellent job portraying the younger Cartwright's. I highly recommend The Ponderosa!",1077235200,27,438,5.859375
1983777,2,B00019PDP2,"But I thought it was the whole season of Ponderosa, but it was only half the season.  I was very disappointed, but still enjoyed the episodes I did get!",1355097600,2,152,4.241379310344827
1983778,5,B00019PDP2,"Although they are calling this the Prequel to Bonanza, it aired from Sept 9, 2001 to May 12, 2002, long after Bonanza had ended. There never was a second season. This set contains the first 10 episodes. To the best of my knowledge, Volume two with the last 10 episodes does not exist. If it does, I can't find it anywhere.

This series answers a lot of questions such as How did Ben Cartwright come to own the Ponderosa? How did The Ponderosa get it's name?
What's the story behind the burning map that starts each episode of Bonanza? How did Hop Sing come to work for The Cartwrights? How did Eric Cartwright get the nickname Hoss?

There are some conflicting stories between the Bonanza TV series and The Ponderosa TV series as to how Eric Cartwright got the nickname ""Hoss"".  On Bonanza, it was Eric's own mother who gave him the name. On The Ponderosa, it was Little Joe and his mother who tagged Eric with the name ""Hoss""

I can't remember the particular episode of Bonanza where Ben was talking about Little Joe's mother and how she died, but I'm almost certain it was from some disease. In the Ponderosa TV series, she died from an explosion that was deliberately set.

It's a little bit strange getting used to different actors playing the parts of the characters we know so well. Despite the different actors, every one of them plays their parts with excellence.

Although there are some conflicting stories,I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to all my fellow Bonanza fans. I hope I can find the last 10 episodes.",1350086400,9,1528,4.5787545787545785

1983783,5,B00019PDP2,"I bought this set for my father for Christmas, because he's a huge fan of the old Bonanza, and I wanted to surprise him with this prequel that he never knew existed.

The series is set ten years before the events of the original Bonanza, and the Cartwright clan has not yet acquired the Ponderosa. This series, produced for the late PAX-TV, does a great service to the viewer who loved the original. Ben Cartwright is still every bit as conscientious as he was in the 1960s, and I don't find myself agreeing that Ben's principles have been revised too much. Ben in Ponderosa has gumption, and while it is a little ""kinder, gentler"", it's still Ben standing up for his principles.

The show is more tranquil, especially after the two-part pilot. Ben acquires the ranch by Lake Tahoe shortly enough, and the boys, with Ben and friend Carlos, build the family compound in what is really the beautiful Australian landscape. The show repeatedly takes advantage of the locale, and it looks achingly wonderful on DvD.

Production-wise, this is as good as television gets. Taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate at the time, they took every advantage in shooting this in Australia. The only programs really analogous would be the TV movies shot for Turner Network Television. Every episode is worth one of those westerns. Every reviewer praising the casting and writing are right too, but I just can't stress enough that the production value and the sets are beyond just about anything.",1265328000,4,1487,4.846456692913386
1983784,4,B00019PDP2,It is a very well done prequel to the TV classic Bonanza with good acting and the quality of the video and sound is excellent. The only complaint I have about this product is that I have not seen a continuation of these series. Another thing that it's needed to be said is about how well the Ponderosa was directed.,1245024000,2,315,4.266666666666667
1983785,1,B00019PDP2,"This was a ridiculous attempt to cash in on the original television series, Bonanza. It was horribly written, and totally disregarded everything that was genuine and beautiful about the Cartwrights as portrayed on Bonanza by Greene, Roberts, Blocker and Landon.

 If you loved the original Cartwrights, it's worth re-watching Bonanza and forgetting about this terrible ""prequel.""",1214265600,8,379,5.75

8009123,2,B00019PDP2,"Let me first say that I LOVE BONANZA. I own the first 6 seasons on DVD and I tape them religiously off cable for the remainder. I understand that new versions make changes but this was a bit much. I know that David Dortort supported this but to be honest, from what I've read about David Dortort; he'd support a lot of avenues in trying to get this show back on the air. It is well documented that David Dortort really took it hard when the series got cancelled even though the show was past its prime. So it was a dream come true for him to have his characters resurrected.  Ours too. And I loved the idea of a prequel. But this... she took a western and turned it into little more than a period piece.  I don't expect the actors to compare to the legends that played them originally but SHEESH. And she changed the history of Little Joe and Marie...I am sorry. I can say more but I won't. This sucks. Maybe someone will post these on YouTube one day and you can save your money especially now that the price has gone up 20 bucks since I bought it. Of course if you're just a Bonanza collector and want to have it for that reason, then by all means.",1456876800,,1150,4.1524663677130045

8009128,4,B00019PDP2,"This show was a decent offering by the PAX family friendly network. It is a good family show with memories of the old Bonanza show tied in. It's basically about how it all started with the kids still young, and the wife around.",1374019200,3,227,4.3023255813953485
8009129,5,B00019PDP2,"Most of the time when a show comes out as a prequel or sequel to an amazing show, it never compares to the original. The Ponderosa on the other hand, has succeeded where many have failed. While it may differ just slightly from the Bonanza story line, for instance in the season four episode of Bonanza ""The First Born"" Little Joe tells Clay that he was born in the main house on the Ponderosa and grew up there, while in the series ""The Ponderosa"" Little Jow is around ten years old and the family has just acquired the land for the Ponderosa. Also, Little Joe's mother's death is depicted differently in both shows. Other than that and maybe a couple of other minor differences though, the show's are very similar. ""The Ponderosa"" is a perfect family show, it has great morals, wonderful stories, good family values, just the right amount of action, and some great actors. My biggest question is: Where is the rest of this amazing series? Vol. 2 please!",1368835200,,954,4.584795321637427
8009130,5,B00019PDP2,"The 2 part pilot gave some prequel explanations and then this series takes on stories of its own.  Although it was obviously not filmed at the ""ponderosa"" site and the Hop-Sing character given a much more significant role, the stories of character, integrity and relationship are certainly worthy of watching with your family.  There were actually 20 episodes done and this is only 10 of them.  It would be nice to have 11-20.  You have to turn loose of the well-ingrained visual characters to embrace Little Joe at age 12, while Hoss at 17 is a very likeable character and a good match to Dan Blocker, and this Adam not as distantly intellectual at age 21. and this Ben is very much a responsible, civic-minded, father-first character rather than the I-will-defend-my-land-to-the-death style that developed in the Bonanza series.  While all of the main characters in Bonanza were quick with a gun, The Ponderosa very much discourages their use.  So while there are some continuity differences, this was very enjoyable and a pleasure to watch for those of who miss the Westerns we grew up with.  Several of the episodes spoke of prejudices which led to interesting discussion at our house - that's always a win-win.  And, you get to know how they got their land in the first place!",1364774400,2,1281,4.8173515981735155
