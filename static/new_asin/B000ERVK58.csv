2533221,4,B000ERVK58,"This sad and gritty film has earned a half dozen festival awards and nominations. It follows the tragic fates of three young women from Jersey City's ghetto--Suzette (a pregnant runaway teenager), Marisol (a crack addict and young mother), and Oz (a drug dealer), whose lives intersect after their separate paths to prison. Nearly every influence in their lives, whether personal or social, is harmful to them, including school, music, home, friends, drug and alcohol abuse, and, most of all, their trash-talking, gangsta boys. The girls live in a malevolent universe that is parallel to anything you would consider normal. Whether they got there by bad luck, bad choices, or by a heartless society that has victimized them is debatable. The director shows his hand, though, with several shots of the Statue of Liberty.",1169596800,3,819,5.165413533834586
2533222,1,B000ERVK58,"The first hour of the show developed on these youngsters who become criminals. I found the first 70 minutes of the movie kind of boring, and I had a very hard time keeping my attention on the movie. I yawned two times.  I could not feel sorry for these characters because, simply, put, as the saying goes, ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.."" This one criminal woman was behind bars crying hysterically when she learned her baby is going to be taken away to foster homes. Well, what do you expect when mom is a crack addict--it made me think she should have thought about that before using illicit drugs. They all offend against society and then cry the blues when they get caught. Oookay where is the tear jerking scene?

It makes you more aware that many young people who are irresponsible living for pleasures of the flesh and quick sensations are having babies left and right which will be supported by our tax dollars, that we live in a society that is so dysfunctional. MULTITUDES and multitudes of such youngsters are doing the same thing--popping out babies having irresponsible relations because it feels good, hense: Poverty breeding more poverty and misery, birth control is never even entertained or thought about. Just living for the moment at the expense--consequences of having sex of course and nothing to do with family planning--of children who are born to such unresponsible, even dope-addicted, so called parents. What a very very sad world we live in.

But more often than not, these young people brought trouble to themselves. And even when given a chance, reoffend..and get caught. And cry the blues for getting caught. Frankly I really didn't see where the ""tear jerking"" scenes were in the movie. It didn't do a thing for me. Other than bore me.",1151366400,4,1782,4.741935483870968
2533223,5,B000ERVK58,"I highly recommend this stunning film to anyone who can appreciate a gritty and at times tear-jerking drama. The cast was perfectly selected, and the characters were so real I found myself checking to see if it was a documentary I was watching. The movie is fascinating and a must see.",1151280000,2,285,4.607843137254902
2533224,5,B000ERVK58,"Besides having a deep love for gritty street dramas, I am also passionate about strong characterizations, realistic narratives that don't fall into Hollywood machine contrivance, and mindblowing performances. ""On the Outs"" has all of this and more. It's a daring, bold and courageous character study of three teenage girls caught in a whirlwind of inner city desperation and desolation. Each actress gave an amazing performance, especially Judy Marte who just has an effortless and natural screen presence. I'll say it here first and mark my words, Marte may be one of this generations most gifted and promising actresses. She plays Oz, a thugged out drug dealer caring for her mentally disabled brother and battling internally with her dope fiend mother. Then there is Paola Mendoza as Marisol, a crack-addicted single mother who loses custody of her child while in a juvenile corrections center. And then there is Anny Mariano as Suzette, a young impressionable teen who falls in love with a drug dealer and his dangerous world. All three of these characters represent the broken and saddened voices of American youth today. These are America's ""forgotten"" daughters. The young women of color who have all the potential in world with very few opportunities to rise above their harsh conditions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving and brutal story with dynamic performances. Prepare to be deeply affected by the wounds of these girls as they struggle to make sense of a world that never quite allows them to heal.",1148169600,7,1540,5.090909090909091
2533225,4,B000ERVK58,"good movie ... it captures the ""street"" feel really well which was really refreshing not to have some over paid actor ""dumbing it down"" and trying to through some slang around and high five people like he's been doing it his whole life.  the actors were believable and i think that's cause a lot of them are from the street or are just super charismatic people in real life and it really shows through in this movie.  i picked it up last week from my indie video store so i don't know if a lot of people will get a chance to see it but they should.  so overall i'd say job well done, congrats for sure on making a good movie.",1147824000,2,625,4.10655737704918

8113834,5,B000ERVK58,"This movie is the story of three youbng women who all live in the same neighborhood in New Jersey, don't know each other but become connected through the criminal justice system. You have OZ, a drug dealer who is in and out of the juvenile detention center and whose mother is a recovering addict, Suzette, who is a high school student who defies her mother and becomes pregnanat by her drug dealer boyfriend, and Marisol, a crack addict who fights to regain custody of her daughter after being placed in the detention center after she buys crack from Terrell, who is Suzette's boyfriend.
 The girls meet after they all are placed in the center. Suzette gets placed in the center after Terrell puts a gun in her backpack that was used to kill a young boy. All three girls have made bad choices and continue to do so until they come to the realization that they themselves need to change. The cast of this movie is basically unknown except for Judy Marte, but it is a good film. Also, the special features on this film are worth watching. Life imitates art for some of the cast members in this film.",1324080000,,1098,4.49
8113835,5,B000ERVK58,"I really felt this movie. Independent films are improving dramatically. In most films depicting the harsh realities of growing up in the ghetto, the main characters are men, and black. I am proud now to see women playing the lead roles in ghetto stories.
I can relate to 2 out of the 3 stories. Marisol was my mother before she(my mom) was killed. I was Marisol's daughter, hungry and wondering when or if my mom was coming home.
I made a real personal connection with Oz. I related to her tomboyish ways and her attitude. Oz was tough, but only because she had to be. With an aging grandmother, and a drug-addicted mother who has repeatedly let her down in life, Oz's only choice of survival that she knew was the streets. She had to make the way for her and her brother whom she loved terribly. At seventeen, that was a lot to take on. And she thought she could, until it all came crashing down on her too fast.
Suzette was a promising young teenager. And she was just that; a teenager. With a hard-working mom who was rarely at home, Suzette was free. Too free. She broke the rules and took a chance on a situation she simply didn't understand. Daydreams defaced reality and she ended up pregnant. Seeing that the boyfriend accepted her situation, she did what most teenagers who believe in fairy tales do; she put her trust in him and a dream. Then she gets caught with his gun and ends up in juvie.
I must say that I am glad to see a film like this in a latin perspective. It shows how black and latin livelihood are very similar in the ghetto and that we are not alone in our struggles. It shows three latin teenage girls who buckle under the pressure with the choice of taking responsibility for their actions and making it better or worse.
Respectable applause. Shout out to Judy Marte (Oz). Good job on being a remarkable tomboy for the very first time. You made an impact on me.",1187222400,,1888,4.381766381766382
8113836,5,B000ERVK58,This is a fantastic movie about teenagers dealing with real life issues.  I watched it and had to watch it again.,1185926400,,113,4.380952380952381
8113837,5,B000ERVK58,"This movie takes you into the heart and soul of urban America, and gives you an idea of why generation after generation of young people keep falling into traps they're too cool to notice.

We have three stories here, all connected by an afternoon in a juvenile detention facility. There's a drug dealer, who is a streetwise girl but gets caught up in a bad deal. Then there's an innocent schoolgirl, who gets sweet-talked and impregnated by a neighborhood thug. Finally, a drug addict who leaves her toddler daughter screaming in hunger to go buy food, but instead spends her money on drugs and carelessly gives the food to the crack man.

As you watch this movie, you want to pound on the TV and ask these young people what the hell they're thinking. Especially the youngest of them, who sees her babydaddy smoking blunts, swigging '40s and playing Russian Roulette during an ordinary stop at a friend's ""crib."" You just want to jump through the screen and talk some sense into this poor kid.

For fear of spoiling the movie, I won't describe specific scenes. But this movie is an absolute classic, and you need to see it. These are the people you see in the welfare lines, in juvenile court, or just the ones on the corner with babies in strollers, stirring up trouble. These are their stories.

And they will break your heart.",1180396800,,1329,4.61864406779661
