5882908,2,B00E0KWB3U,Just one of those movies you watch when you don't really want to pay full attention to it while browsing the web doing research.,1382140800,,128,4.375
5882909,4,B00E0KWB3U,"A fun and entertaining comedy about a legendary boy who is lost at sea, and grows up somewhere in Asia. David Hasselhoff plays the campy arch villain.  Overall the film is worth watching.",1377993600,,187,4.666666666666667
8599802,3,B00E0KWB3U,"Entertaining, so that's what I wanted.",1488499200,,38,5.5
8599803,4,B00E0KWB3U,"The saving grace of this movie is seeing ""The Hoff "" sing and do basic movie fighting in interesting hair and costumes.",1445040000,,119,4.454545454545454
8599804,4,B00E0KWB3U,"It's like Sharknado, except instead of CGI, you get The Hoff!

I mean, you can't overthink the movie.  It's a lot of jokes that are funny but don't really make you laugh, and the characters are heartwarming, but not enough for you to care about them.  In another dimension it would be Mystery Science Theater's wet dream.

I'm glad I watched it, probably won't watch it again, though I think it might be amusing to watch it with a group of friends in the right mood.",1408406400,,466,4.383720930232558
8599805,3,B00E0KWB3U,"If you are looking for something that is just funny and off the wall, then this is the movie to watch.  It is not a high budget film, just a fun lighthearted comedy.",1400716800,,165,4.0
8599806,4,B00E0KWB3U,"This is just a fun movie.  I suppose one could call it a coming of age story but fun is more appropriate.  David Hasselhoff is hilarious as a paranoid past his prime ninja who strives to reclaim fame and power.  Lucas Grabeel is excellent as the young ""legendary dancing ninja"" who must learn to be a man before he can become his destiny and his dancing alone make the film worth watching.",1399075200,,389,4.375
8599807,5,B00E0KWB3U,"I am not a Hasselhoff fine. I don't like or dislike him. But I know is reputation, so I wasn't expected much at all when I started to watch Dancing Ninja. If anything, I expected a late night B or even C movie.

Not. What. I. Got.

Honestly - I loved this movie. It was hilarious. I have to respect David for playing such a silly character. And Lucas Grabeel did a wonderful job with the comedy - I'm actually going to see if he has other hidden gems.

In an age that needs bathroom jokes to consider itself ""comedy"" - this was highly refreshing. Ok, there was the naive sex jokes, but they were very lowkey.",1398902400,,608,4.17948717948718
8599808,1,B00E0KWB3U,"It looked so bad that I thought that it might be laughable-good. I was wrong about the laughable-good part. So lame and boring, we had to turn it off because it was agitating us to be wasting our time hoping it would get better.",1389225600,,228,4.204545454545454
8599809,4,B00E0KWB3U,"Very funny,surprisingly at first I was thinking boring B movie but the picture does keep you watching and entertained believe it or not.",1387497600,,136,4.956521739130435
8599810,1,B00E0KWB3U,"I thought it would at least be fun, but I couldn't even finish it.  Maybe if you REEEEEAAALLLLY liked HSM it has redeeming qualities, but this one wasn't for me :)",1386374400,,163,4.258064516129032
8599811,4,B00E0KWB3U,"If you take this film for what it is (a SPOOF spoofing other spoofs) then it's worth the time and laughter spent watching it.
Take it seriously and you will be sadly disappointed.",1385164800,,179,4.454545454545454
