If YOU WANT THE REAL TRUTH, watch the Documentary called 77 MINUTES! THIS IS THE WORST ACTING I EVER SAW!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!",1518739200,,272,4.055555555555555
8220717,3,B000VZK1O4,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I heard this film was based on actual events that happened in the early 80s, I was instantly intrigued.  After all, the horrors of real life make excellent foundations on which to base thrillers and horror movies.  Interestingly, the film is a mishmash of both good and bad aspects.  The result is a lackluster film that drags in the middle, but boasts one heck of an ending.

Before I continue with this review, I feel I must warn you up front:  the picture quality of this film is very grainy and sometimes blurry.  Im not sure if the transfer did not take or if this is a copy from the VHS, but I did not like it regardless.  I wouldnt let this dissuade you from buying the film, but I do see this as something I must mention.

BLOODY WEDNESDAY is shot decently for the most part, yet the camerawork does not offer anything new or inventive.  The cinematography is used to tell the story, and thats it.

The acting is so-so, with Raymond Elmendorf giving a decent performance as the main character, Harry.  This was Elmendorfs first lead role, and according to his IMDB page, it was his last.  I don't know if this role was the reason for his decline in Hollywood (he went on to be an extra in one more film, and then his career ended), but Im sure it didn't help things.  The rest of the cast is forgettable, and nobody really gives a breakout performance.

The storyline of BLOODY WEDNESDAY is interesting, and yet I don't feel the writer fully fleshes out Harry and who he is.  Sure, we get to see his mental decline, but his interactions with the imaginary images are almost comical sometimes.  Granted, the snake was intense, but everything else is simplistic and tame.  I don't consider what we get to see onscreen enough to force a mental breakdown.

BUT

I will state the last few minutes of the film are excellent and crazy-intense.  As the massacre played out onscreen, I found myself enthralled.  The brutality of the scene and the senselessness of the carnage heighten the horror, and the viewer is left almost in a state of awe.

Because of the awesome ending, I have to recommend BLOODY WEDNESDAY to fans of thrillers and mild horror.  While this is not a great film, it still offers a decent viewing experience (except for the picture quality), and is worthy of a look.",1462233600,,2365,4.484777517564403

The dialogue alone will make u crack up laughing  in this movie, but then the storyline takes you away. It's like a creepy vivid nightmare.

8220721,3,B000VZK1O4,"""Bloody Wednesday"" starring Raymond Elmendorf as Harry, a mechanic who loses his job and his grip on reality, gives an uncomfortable nod to the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre committed by James Huberty. After being fired from his job Harry turns up at a church service naked, and is evaluated for psychiatric illness. He takes up residence in an old abandoned hotel and his grip on reality becomes more and more tenuous. One thing that makes the movie interesting is that it's frequently difficult determining right away what is reality and what is in Harry's fevered imagination. Given the numerous subplot excesses here, it's vital to understand what's going on, but the objective truth is frequently intentionally concealed by director Mark Gilhuis and Academy Award winning screenwriter Philip Yordan.

Characters come and go throughout the film, but many of the most disturbing interactions are with a street gang and multiple ghosts that are resident in the hotel. Furthering the 1980s creepiness on display here, Harry's best friend is his teddy bear, which talks to him, and later serves as judge, jury, and executioner in the most bizarre trial scene I can readily recall. Harry engages in childlike fantasies (e.g. using a broom as a rifle, which garners attention from the FBI!) on one hand, but he descends further and further into madness with plotpoints involving his analyst, his brother, his ex-wife (who has perhaps the most attention-getting scene with him,) several ghosts and visions, snakes, diamonds, and serial suicides in the haunted room 1327. When his brother reveals that they are going to tear the hotel down and Harry must move out, the spiral out of control picks up speed rapidly, concluding with mass murder in a diner of death, the conclusion of which is veritably a promotion for concealed carry permits.

The movie is dark and atmospheric, and on one level it works as a study in madness, but it's also overly long, slowly paced, and dated. Elmendorf is excellent as Harry, and Pamela Baker is likewise good as Dr. Johnson, while the rest of the cast varies from very good to caricatures (the FBI broom investigation was particularly painful.) The film is quite violent, seemingly pointlessly so, but that is a conscious part of the nightmarish point about the irrationality of mass murders ""Bloody Wednesday"" is making.",1395878400,,2360,5.06426735218509

8220723,1,B000VZK1O4,"Bloody Wednesday, 1985 film

""Television news tells us we live in a violent world. Most stay out of public parks and streets after sundown. Are we safe in out homes behind locked doors? This film tells what happened in a coffee shop."" The first scene shows bodies on a floor. A man in a suit goes to a big car garage to pick up his repaired car. ""There's no motor in my car!"" ""I can't put it back together"" says Harry. ""I forgot. Nothing fits."" Something is really wrong here. Ben takes Harry home. We see people in a church singing a hymn. Harry shows up nude! ""Is he crazy?"" A born loser? Mrs. Curtis leaves. Harry is in the psych ward; he is dangerous. ""There's nowhere to hide, you adapt"" days his doctor. Too angry? Harry is released on probation (due to overcrowding). Harry finds a place to stay, an empty hotel building. ""Keep all the doors locked."" Harry is delusional.

We hear cats crying. Harry sees three men tearing up an apartment. The men are taken away by the police. At night he hears a woman screaming for help. No one is there when he opens the door. Later his brother arrives to check up on him. His teddy bear talks to him. At night a snake enters through the open window and crawls into his bed. It turns into a twisted sheet. He gets a phone call from room 1327 for a pot of coffee. But that room has been empty for years. Harry goes there to investigate and finds a woman there! ""I tried to stop her."" ""What bellboy?"" Harry hears men at his door. Can he escape? The police and firemen arrive to rescue Harry. Next Harry climbs over the wall to find a large swimming pool with a blonde woman. They talk. Harry plays the piano very well. [Its not really him.] The woman dances. Is it his fantasy? The FBI arrives to question Harry about a rifle aimed at an airplane. He is told not to aim a broomstick out a window.

Those three men return to Harry's hotel. They chase Harry again through the building. Will his teddy bear help him? In a way. Harry pulls a pistol to defend himself. [Harry's .44 magnum?] The teddy bear says `guilty' for two of the men, `not guilty' for the third. A shot is fired. Next we are in a pool hall. Those three men report to their leader. Harry visits that blonde again at night. They talk. Cups fall to the floor and shatter. Harry returns to Jake's place to ask for his old job back. ""No, I can't take that chance."" A job in the paint shop? That doesn't work out well. Harry returns to that hotel to find a job. He learns about the suicide of a diamond salesman. Where are the missing diamonds of Walter Burns? Harry must find Luke Cramer, the house detective. He does. Harry pulls his big pistol to shoot Luke so he falls out the window.

""Its all yours."" But that suitcase has snakes in it! One of the three men abducts Harry. What would he do with a machine gun? A club is more practical for earning power. Next his wife shows up at the hotel, her lease was up. They talk about their past. She undresses. Harry attacks her in the bath tub! ""Its been a terrible day."" Brother Ben arrives with bad news. They system is falling apart. Small companies have hard times. What about Elaine? Harry visits his psychiatrist to talk about his condition. Where will he go? ""I can't play."" What can they do? Nothing, unless Harry commits a felony. ""Help me!"" That man shows up with an UZI! ""Use it."" The doctor goes to the police: sign a complaint. What will Harry do? He visits a coffee shop and starts blasting away. His gun never runs out of bullets! None of the people can defend themselves! At last one man shoots Harry to terminate his rampage.
[You wonder who produced this crazy message movie? Read the credits.] This is a very scary story. No mention of the cause of his madness. Exposure to industrial chemicals is one cause, so too the use of illegal drugs. Some physical condition? What about the economic times? Or all of the above. Do bad economic times result in more mental illness? What does that mean?",1336435200,,3962,4.342780026990553
8220724,3,B000VZK1O4,"I enjoyed watching 'Bloody Wednesday' so much that I had to buy it!  The film has a BIZARRE way of showing the audience what happens when one loses touch with reality.  It goes great with all my other odd-ball Horror flicks I've collected over the years.  What I find great about 'Bloody Wednesday', is that there's never a dull moment, as in WTF moments!  There's plenty of them.  I enjoyed the strange approach used to describe the infamous crime inspired by the 1984 McDonald's massacre in California by James Huberty.  Raymond Elmendorf does a fantastic job in playing a weirdo.  I love how the film captures Raymond's character, Harry, is losing his sanity, slipping further from reality, and becoming even more swallowed up in a sick, dream-like state of mind.  His conversations with his teddy bear and how, in his mind, brings the bear to life, is creepy stuff!  His teddy bear has all the ""right"" answers.  The last fifteen minutes of this flick is even crazier!  Lets just say that when Harry does walk in the restaurant and starts spraying bullets everywhere, you'd think the scene is never going to end! - It's that insane.  Note: I personally think it's messed up that a film like this was given the green light right after the McDonald's massacre.  That's what's keeping me from giving this film a five star rating.",1268265600,4,1329,4.726086956521739
8220725,1,B000VZK1O4,"From the description of this movie, it sounds like one of those Texas Chainsaw Massacre clones they made so many of during the 80s. That's what I expected: Not a great cinematic masterpiece, but 90 minutes of mindless entertainment. Unfortunately, this was not at all what I expected. The movie is about a guy with hallucinations and then goes berserk, killing people in a diner. This scene is a couple of minutes at the end of the film, and up until that point it's s a bad attempt at some kind of psychological thriller.

Don't get fooled by the title, the plot description or the fact that this was written by an Oscar winning screenwriter. We all have our bad days, I guess. Don't waste your time and money.",1151193600,,711,4.511627906976744
