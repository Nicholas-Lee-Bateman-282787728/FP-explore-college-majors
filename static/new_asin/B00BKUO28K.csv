8570024,1,B00BKUO28K,"If there was a way to pick zero stars, I would have...I did not notice when I bought this it was unauthorized.  Horrible, Horrible Horrible!!!",1368835200,2,142,4.68
8570025,1,B00BKUO28K,"Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap!  All of these interviews can be seen on youtube and if you are a true M&S fan you've already seen these interviews a bunch of times.  I can see why this is unauthorized.  I hope when the ""authorized"" DVD comes out in June, it's a lot better than this!",1368230400,,305,4.05
8570026,1,B00BKUO28K,"Unauthorized is the key word...Mumford would never sell or be involved with this drivel. In fact, they would have declined the interviews had they know this was the result. Contains six completely unconnected short interviews; most of which contain very near nothing. Move on...there is nothing to see here! Just another media company trying to capitalize on the bandwagon.",1368144000,,373,5.338983050847458
