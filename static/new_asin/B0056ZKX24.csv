4593255,5,B0056ZKX24,"The move has two great, long gone, actors; i.e., Steven Boyd and Susan Hayward. Hayward plays a woman on the frontier land where her husband is killed fighting a forest fire as a ranger. she has a small son and the farm that she then tries to save, but becomes too much for her when all of a sudden, in answer to her flyers, Boyd shows up to lend a helping hand. Her son, Robby likes Boyd at first, but later, as Boyd and Hayward become romantically involved and then married, Robby turns against Boyd.  Animosity grows between Hayward and Boyd as tension grows between the boy and her husband. She turns Boyd away from her bedroom and wants to separate from him, but he forcibly take her, sexually, and she becomes pregnant.

Early, in the movie, Boyd had saved both Hayward and Robbie from freezing to death in a blizzard, but that doesn't help now. Hayward starts to miscarriage the baby and collapses, and Boyd drives the wagon thru heavy torrential rains to get to the doctor far away, and carries her in his arms over the last 5 miles to get there. Robbie hides in the woods, and when he returns to the farm house and cannot find his mother, he thinks Boyd had killed his mother.

The Doctor saves Hayward's life but informs her that much of the fault of the difference between her son and Boyd is the fault of her son and her. Boyd, meantime goes back to the woods to find the son because Hayward is worried about him.

What happens in the conclusion I leave to the buyer of this DVD as it is tense and exciting and the ending is powerful. The movie has a blizzard, a forest fire, great open country scenery, great acting, and the involvement of a quicksand that is instrumental to the story.",1373760000,3,1699,4.3841269841269845

4593257,4,B0056ZKX24,"Story:

""Mary Sharron (Susan Hayward) has lost her husband to a forest fire. To help her run the ranch, she hires Fred Carter (Stephen Boyd), a handy man. A handsome, but taciturn fellow who has known much tragedy, Fred works hard for her. Robbie Sharron (Dennis Holmes), the woman's son, resents him, and when he learns that his mother is planning to marry him to quell ugly rumors in town, the youth is most unhappy. After the wedding, the stepfather treats the boy harshly, not out of cruelty, but because he wants to prepare the boy to survive the tough life ahead"".

Nice Drama, filmed in Cinemascope and looks very good on this DVD-R product, which contains in stereo a isolated track of the score by Hugo Friedhofer.

Picture Quality is very good. Doesn't have any damages. Soundtrack is in stereo.
Doesn't contains any subtitles.

Like very much Stephen Boyd since his most famouse role as Messala in ""Ben Hur"".",1318896000,13,919,4.725

4593264,5,B0056ZKX24,"Susan Hayward is at her best as a modern (1950's) woman who really wants a family. Little Robbie was a wonderful actor who played his role as an insecure, spoiled and bratty kid. We learn he really wants a father to love him and for him to love. His professionalism in his role belies his age. Susan's tough,yet tender husband was ruggedly handsome and was very believable as a new step dad and husband. Other colorful characters such as Doc round out a fine cast. The scenes of the
Canadian Rockies is breath taking and make the movie all the more enjoyable to watch especially on my 65 inch screen. This was real life family drama with a happy ending.",1388275200,,653,4.45
4593265,3,B0056ZKX24,"I'm a Susan Hayward fan and just saw this movie for the first time.  I have to say, it's not one of my favorites.  I found dear little Robbie to be extremely annoying, and almost evil at times, especially when he threatened Stephen Boyd's character.  Sorry, but Robbie was a wimpy little jerk.  Poor Stephen Boyd was constantly rescuing him and/or Susan (and both at times) but never got any credit until the end until the doctor (Theodore Bikel) scolded Susan for not understanding her husband.  I don't understand the title, either--what was she obsessed with?  Her kid?  Her new husband?  And how did this ""farm woman"" stay so perfectly coiffed?",1385510400,,648,4.774774774774775
4593266,5,B0056ZKX24,"""Woman Obsessed"", based on the novel ""The Snow Birch"" by John Mantley,
was made into a movie in 1959 and the main stars were:
Susan Hayward as Mary Sharron
Stephen Boyd as Fred Carter
Barbara Nichols as Mayme Radzevitch
Dennis Holmes as Robbie Sharron
Theodore Bikel as Dr R.W. Gibbs

I am at a loss as to why the movie was titled ""Woman Obsessed"".  Mary
Sharron was certainly not obsessed.  She was just doing what all good
mothers would do - protecting her young son Robbie from the verbal
abuse of an over-zealous step-father.  If anyone was obsessed, it was her
son Robbie who as time went on and for good reasons, disliked his new
step-father more and more and eventually does his best to get rid of him.

The recent marriage between Mary and Fred starts off well but things
begin to deteriorate rapidly when Fred declares Robbie to be a coward
because the boy fainted at the sight of blood whilst being forced by
Fred to watch the skinning of a deer that Fred had just shot.  Fred
hates cowards due to an unfortunate incident in his family years earlier
when his brother failed to act and save the life of Fred's wife because
he was afraid.  Since then, Fred has hated all cowards and declares
that he himself is not a coward and that he is afraid of nothing.
That of course is about to change through the efforts of young Robbie.

Fred's unforgiving ways disrupts the family unity and creates tensions with
his wife and Robbie.  His wife disapproves of her husband's abnormal
actions and sides with her son.

In retaliation, Robbie deliberately lures his step-father into a mud pit from
which he is unable to escape.  Continually sinking down into the mud to
his demise, he pleads with the boy for help, proving that he himself is in
fact a coward and afraid to die.

All ends well with Fred finally coming to his senses and realizing that not
everyone including himself is perfect and that he should display more
tolerance with his step-son.

This movie has all that is necessary to make it an intelligent and convincing
real life drama.  There is a strong cast who perform well with Susan Hayward
and Stephen Boyd at their usual best and young Dennis Holmes is outstanding
as Robbie.  He is truly believable.

""Woman Obsessed"" was filmed entirely in the great outdoors with many
spectacular scenes and is in its original theatre presentation of cinemascope,
color and stereo sound.  Who could ask for more?

This DVD is a limited edition of 3,000 units, so if you want one then grab it now
before they are gone.

Highly recommended.",1379289600,3,2541,4.594235033259423

8460056,4,B0056ZKX24,"Saw this years ago on American Movie Classics channel.  I thought Hayward was a little too old for the part, but she handled her part well, as usual.  She was one of the greats.  Boyd is too young and gorgeous for his role, but evokes the appropriate emotions of anger, frustration, and pity; and, frankly, he was so good that he's a little scary like he was in Ben Hur.  He is one of my favorite actors, and he always tried his best in his movies.  They both died far too young.  The ""kid"" in this is also very good, in a sometimes annoying way.  Bottom line is that if you're nostalgic for a good old fashioned, sometimes passionate (in a 1950s way) story, this movie will not disappoint you.  This reminded me of ""All that Heaven Allows"" with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson.",1457827200,,773,4.319444444444445
