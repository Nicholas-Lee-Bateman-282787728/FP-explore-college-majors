It is definitely a New Age view of religion and Hindu philosophy. It has some nuggets of interest- IF you already know what he is talking about! Most of it just trash, and there are only about ten minutes, maybe twenty, of the caves. They are all jumbled together- so unless you know which cave you are seeing, you have no idea what you are looking at. Is this Ajanta? Ellora? Elephanta? Some of the images he selects are completely anachronistic, and more than half of the video isn't about India at all. It is more random thoughts about religions and cults around the world and through time.

If you are New Ager into energies and life forces, this is pretty to look at (except the occasional blank black screen... what is THAT about???) If you want to know something about the cave temples of India... look elsewhere.",1232150400,3,982,4.455555555555556

Bender brings us images and understandings from his own journey there providing a story that is informative and beautiful, allowing us to travel there. For anyone who is interested in sacred spaces, this video is highly recommended!",1140739200,3,340,5.2

There are multiple treatment levels to this video from the physical, mystical, architectural, sexual and geometrical.  There is an enormous amount of information to obtain in one viewing and I have viewed the video numerous times because of the amount of information contained in it.  Enjoy.",1140480000,2,378,5.163934426229508
