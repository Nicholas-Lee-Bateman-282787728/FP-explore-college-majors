7876853,1,6304753373,"Dull, bloodless direct-to-video dreck. The shortsighted should be forewarned in case they think they are purchasing an unlikely double feature of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It takes an hour for any zombies to emerge and even then nothing happens. The final minute of the movie is so dark you can't even see what is going on. However it may interest horror fans to know that the movie features Zita Johann, who was the co-star of the old Karloff classic THE MUMMY. The only good bits of this garbage are a couple of brief 3 Stooges clips.  Do yourself a favor and watch George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD or Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD (DEAD ALIVE) instead. You can't go wrong with those two.",1033084800,2,714,4.534883720930233
7876854,1,6304753373,"I love Romero""s [Dawn] as well as [Night],and if thats what your looking for, you are definetly in the wrong place. All I can say is that anybody involved with this production should be lined up and shot. I  honestly don't know where to begin. The theme song was the worst----painful  to hear---totally 80""s,totally tasteless and very gay.",958089600,2,339,4.827586206896552
7876855,5,6304753373,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. There is not one good thing about it. The directing, edting, acting, and story is so weak. But I love watching this movie. The best thing about the movie is the theme by George  Edward Ott!",947980800,3,229,4.204545454545454
7876856,1,6304753373,In the name of GOD don't buy this movie. The cover art was better than the movie. (I use the term movie loosely) The acting was the worst thing I have ever seen. I have spent more money on a good dinner than was spent on the  special effects for this (movie). I should have turned it off after the kid  turned his Grand Fathers Laser Disk Player in to a death ray. The same  effect used to beam people up in the old Star Trek TV series was used to  make the laser beams. (scraching the film) After watching this (movie) I  could not even bring myself to rewind it. It now sit on the self and I  threaten to tie the kids up and make the watch it again if they act up.,946684800,4,666,3.8962962962962964
7876857,1,6304753373,"If you like cheap horror movies, there are millions more out there, and they are probably all better than this one.  This movie isn't even very bloody, as most of the killing is done with a lazer that some kid makes  from a compact disk player. Don't waste your money, instead stick to  Romero's Night of the Living Dead trilogy.",937785600,,329,4.45
