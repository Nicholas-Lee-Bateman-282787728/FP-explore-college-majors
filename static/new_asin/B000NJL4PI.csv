SHOCKWAVE 2003

This is absolutely one of the best Mixed Martial Arts events of all time with out a doubt. For those who do not know this was Pride Fighting Championship's big show every year. This one in particular is the set for the big rematch between the legend Royce Gracie against Hidehiko Yoshida. The year previous to this one Royce lost in a very controversial match, he did not tap regardless and he proved it this night.

1. QUINTON ""RAMPAGE"" JACKSON VS IKUHISA MINOWA-the first round is full of exciting action at the expense of Minowa as Rampage dominates him. Of the greatest highlight reel slams of all time takes place early in the round. Plus Rampage throws some crazy knees on the ground, he destroys him. Then Rampage hits another highlight reel slam that is crazy, excellent first round. The second round does not go that far as Rampage lays him out with a sick knee. Great fight that is really kinda one sided. 5/5

2. HEATH HERRING VS GIANT SILVA-one of the most entertaining fights of all time is what you get with this one. Heath is absolutely amazing in this fight as he dodges every thing the big man throws at him and just chops him down with some devastating leg kicks. The second round looks much like the first with some crazy leg kicks delivered to Silva. The fight ends rather quickly in the third when Silva actually takes Heath down but Herring slaps on a rear naked choke for the win. 5/5

3. MURILO ""NINJA"" RUA VS AKIRA SHOJI-this fight does not last long right here as Ninja shows why is one of the best in the world. After some ground work by both participants Ninja lands a sick knee and knocks him out. Good quick fight. 4.5/5

4. ROYCE GRACIE VS HIDEHIKO YOSHIDA-this is the fight that all had come to see the long awaited re match because Royce got screwed the last time. For those who do not know their first fight at the previous years ""Shockwave"" Royce did not tap but the crowd and the ref wanted a Gracie to loose, so they called the fight, it was also later determined that Yoshida was talking to the ref the whole time. When it was cleared that he did not tap the fight was thrown out and this rematch as well as the first ""Bushido"" series with team Gracie vs Team Japan. The first round is a really good one as both fighters do their thing as the trade on the ground with some good submissions, but Royce takes the round as he pounds on him. That is the crazy thing because Royce always submits his opponents but in this one he just wanted to beat him. The second round is a complete domination on the part of Gracie as he destroys Yoshida with some vicious ground and pound. Royce just wanted to pound him out for both rounds knowing if it went the distance it would be a draw. But like every one said Royce dominated this fight and truly won it. Classic fight the Gracies are legends. 5/5

5. DON FRYE VS GARY GOODRIDGE-this fight last seconds as these two heavy hitters exchange some leather. But it is not a fist that ends this rematch it is a high kick from Gary that lays Don flat. This is a quick and exciting bout. 5/5

6. DANIEL GRACIE VS WATARU SAKATA-another example of why the Gracies are a legendary family because Gracie dominates. It is a good fight as Sakata holds his own but Gracie sinks in a sick arm bar and the ref is forced to call it. Bill Goldberg was on commentary along side Bas and them. 4/5

7. MARIO SPERRY VS YUKI KONDO-this is an extremely exciting fight as these two warriors go head to head in this classic, short though. Renzo Gracie is one the commentary on this one giving his insight. The fight is very back and forth until a knee delivered to Sperry leaves him cut and unable to countinue. 5/5

8. RONY SEFU VS KIYOSHI TAMURA-this one does not last long as guest commentator Rampage's boy Rony gets dominated in this fight. He gets mounted and then gets an arm bar for his troubles. Quick but good fight, great commentary. 4/5

9. KAZUSHI SAKURABA VS ANTONIO ROGERIO NOGUEIRA-Don Frye joins the commentary on this one for the main event of the evening. These are two legends in the sport go at it in this one with Nogueira comes out with some great knees. The first round goes into one of the greatest fights of all time. Very back and forth with a lot of high spots and highlight reel worthy moments. Excellent first round as these two do battle, excellent fight. The second round looked just like the first as these two did battle like no others. Sakuraba got caught in some slick submissions but found ways out of them. The final round is just brilliant because the standard that they set in the first two rounds was surpassed in this final round. In the last seconds of the fight Sakuraba takes some vicious kicks to the face that busts his mouth open. This is an instant classic for sure, classic by far. 5/5

BONUS FIGHT

HAYATO SAKRAI VS DAIJU TAKASE-excellent first round between these warriors as the go back and forth with some great ground work and some good standing action. The second round looked much like the first with some really good action that all real fans would appreciate. An excellent third round displays these two guys' hearts as Sacra goes on to win this. 4/5

This is an excellent event worthy of any price asked in my opinion, but if you can find the previous years event.",1247961600,2,5299,4.4059304703476485
