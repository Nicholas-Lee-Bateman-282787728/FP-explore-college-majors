382043,5,6301928482,This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  I was already a fan of SCTV when I watched these (originally shown as three separate half-hour episodes) and I was expecting them to be good...but they were much funnier than I expected.  We really need this on DVD.  The Martin Short/Playboy episode still gets me on the floor laughing even after 20 years.,1121817600,2,357,4.546875
382044,5,6301928482,"This is on of the best multi story movies I ever seen. The first story includes one of Martin Short's best preformances. Short plays the roll of a 80's lounge singger, Who is employed by a Playboy to provide entertainment for a party that simmular to a Playboy mansion party. Little does Short Know that he's in for a hilarious, but Really Weird night. Next John Candy play a terrific role as a con man who only want whats ""not rightfully his"" from the town and its Really Weird characters. Lastly Catherine O'heras Really Weird Tale has elements that may ruin the story so you must see for yourself. All in all this is a truly classic comedy Staring and writin by members of the great comedy troop of Secound City Tv. Eventhough I think this film is a classic, this film is not for everyone. If you enjoy SCTV this movie was made for you, But if you don't enjoy SCTV, its increadibly talented cast, or other hilarious films by the flaughtry Bros, (misspelled) like Going Beserk,or 80's comidies in general, then you may just think that Really Weird Tales is better of being a Really rare and out of print film. I Myself think of this as a crime, But since this was a low budget made for HBO film, it probly means this treasure's master copy will stay hidden in HBO's movie vault, and loyal fans will never see this classic cult film rerealeased, like dozens of classic's that seem to be suffering the same dark fate.",986428800,,1417,4.453846153846154
382045,5,6301928482,"I wish I could find this movie again!  It's the funniest, cutest, most unforgettably endearing flick ever made!  I showed this movie to everyone I know when it was first available and still today we find it in our  conversations and we still find it hilarious! If you were a fan of the  Second City TV show, you would find it a necessary component of your  library! Please bring this back! It's a classic!",951091200,5,405,4.418918918918919
7817302,5,6301928482,"I saw this when I was a kid but only remembered a few scenes. So, I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting myself in to. Weird, funny and unusual. If you are at all familiar with the comedy style of SCTV, you'll love these wacky, weird tales.",1503100800,,243,4.083333333333333
7817303,3,6301928482,"Despite having a great performance from John Candy, this series was cancelled early and rightly so.  I took the advice from other reviews and I have to say I totally disagree with them.  This was awful.  Awful acting and an awful script. I was whole heartedly disappointed as it seemed it was a slapstick version of sketch comedy (amateurish sketch comedy).  It had potential but fell way short of what it could have been.  Of course, if they tried a little harder, they might not have been cancelled after three episodes.  After growing up watching the Outer Limits, the Twighlight Zone, Monsters and Tales from the Darkside, it is by no means ""weird"" as the title suggests.  Great for nostalgia purposes or if you are a collector of obscure, strange, bizarre, B grade or odd things that made it to TV.",1502323200,,803,4.652482269503546
7817304,5,6301928482,"Three of the FUNNIEST, separate, [half-hour] episodes I ever saw. The Martin Short/Playboy episode still gets me on the floor laughing even after 30 years... my VHS-tape----like me!----is worn-out after many years of abusive wear 'n' tear.
Cannot wait to see this... without those, danged, squiggly, danged, horizontal horizontal lines.",1467244800,,336,5.74
7817305,5,6301928482,"Skits are as kooky as they are funny.  For mature, comedy-audiences, only.  John Candy (r.i.p.) is great, as always.  Highly recommended movie.",1402617600,,143,5.409090909090909
7817306,5,6301928482,"I first watched this in 1990 on HBO. Back then I absolutely loved it and spent many years searching for it.
Well, I found it (of course) on Amazon (although it's on VHS only) and couldn't be happier.

the movie consists of 3 separate stories - Martin Short's skit about a half-wit/non-talent nightclub singer Shucky has the best one liners and quotable lines, Catherine O'Hara's love-cursed woman is the funniest, and John Candy is hilarious as a Harold Hill type Alien real estate agent.

A classic!",1366761600,,507,4.804597701149425
7817307,5,6301928482,I remember seeing this soo many years ago and it was great to finally be able to see it again. Super funny..,1335312000,,108,3.9545454545454546
7817308,5,6301928482,"Three separate tales done in the style of Twighlight Zone. The original SCTV cast delivers some great tales and will have you laughing the whole time. Although perhaps tame by todays standards, it was cutting edge at it's release. Fans of John Candy, Martin Short, and the rest should consider this essential viewing.",1306454400,,317,5.0
7817309,5,6301928482,"Three, 20-30 minute vignette gems from post-SCTV stardom. Well written comedy that balances storyline with one liner laughs. The style and topics mirror the genius of SCTV, but with more evolved plots and character development. Candy and Short are brilliant, and although I always felt that Catherine O'Hara was a better writer than screen performer. Joe Flaherty also appears throughout all the vignettes as a narrative voice (and on screen face) to segueway from one story to the next. Candy's story is most poignant and relevant today in 2010 than the others, given the global economic state. Sincere laughs all around, and a reminder that although SCTV ended, its comedic spirit endures.",1265673600,4,691,5.178571428571429
