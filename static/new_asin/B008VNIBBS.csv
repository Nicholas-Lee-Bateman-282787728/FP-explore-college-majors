8531092,5,B008VNIBBS,This is a brief biography of Liszt--showing different places that he lived.  It also showed some of his pianos and original letters and music.  Liszt's music is often playing in the background.  It is 'dubbed' but I didn't find that it detracted from my enjoyment of the DVD.,1462665600,4,275,4.6875

8531096,5,B008VNIBBS,"this fast moving dvd is full of great information on the composer .students of piano music will love it. however it omits this 13 symphonic poems and his two symphonies. his faust symphonie begins in no key and ends with the devils tail sliding across the ground. this last symphonic poem ""from the cradle to the grave""  written in 1882, is the most interesting",1365984000,13,361,4.640625
