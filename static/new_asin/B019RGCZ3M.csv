7580822,5,B019RGCZ3M,"Absolutely eye-opening.

Most people are unaware of the harm caused by aid - and this movie causes you to re-think everything from food aid to social enterprises that claim to reduce poverty.

I will be sharing with my entire network. Thanks for taking the time to make this film!",1454457600,7,280,4.6938775510204085
7580823,5,B019RGCZ3M,"This is very interesting and thought provoking.  It is hard to tackle the situation though.  Putting a stop to the current industry and changing it will be extremely difficult.  But once people become aware of the consequences of aid as we know it now, they can spark constructive conversation and strategies to develop a different kind of aid that works.  Unfortunately there are too many greedy rich companies and corrupt governments for change to happen easily.  Coming from Africa myself, I know the danger highly subsidized imports holds.  Other African countries struggle a lot more.",1516147200,,589,5.147368421052631
7580824,5,B019RGCZ3M,"This is a much watch film! Many countries are suffering around this world. Most often we can lay the blame at poor leadership or possibly even corrupt leadership. But this documentary highlights how sophisticated m/more developed countries can actually contribute to the failures of struggling countries. Well-intentioned people (or truly greedy individuals and organizations) or drunk with the power of well accumulated in the guise of charity. And countries are laid waste by people who are too eager to help but not enthusiastic enough to listen!  Is it possible that most countries and charities or contributing to the sh-tholes  The president declared? Get thoroughly educated watching this film. It should be mandatory for kids to view  in the seventh grade, sophomore year, and senior year. The implications of this documentary is mind blowing.",1516147200,,851,5.383458646616542
7580825,1,B019RGCZ3M,"I have to leave a one star review. Not because the documentary doesn't call attention to major problems in the subsidized poverty industry and how it fails to create a solution, but because it totally oversimplifies the problem. The industry of Aid is a major problem to be sure, and especially because one of the goals of Aid from the IMF, World Bank, U.N., and NGOs is Globalization, privatization of sovereign national resources in the nations receiving aid when they fail to pay back loans, and deals with Western Corporations for all kinds of resources, cheap labor, factories, agriculture, co-ops, etc. The problem however is not really Aid from Western nations, or the resulting loss of local jobs. In reality, it is far more a problem of logistics. Since these economies have never been developed (partially a result of all the foreign aid), they could never support a prosperous economic condition, without foreign aid. There is no safety net, welfare, or social security in these nations. Even in America, our real (total) unemployment rate is close to 25%. All this subsidized foreign aid is not taxes from taxpayers, it is national debt/deficit spending. Our national debt is supposedly almost $21 Trillion dollars. Our actual national debt in total including all unfunded liabilities is likely closer to 10 times that amount. The point is: We are not in a position to, -through socialism to our AG industry, subsidize massive amounts of foreign aid to the world. We are in far worse shape financially, than the nations we are ""helping"". Back to the problem of logistics. This problem can only be solved by somehow making sure that only the people who need aid get it. Those who don't or who can work, shouldn't get it. The big takeaway and strong point of this documentary, is that rather than creating an industry of debt, usury, and continual dependence on foreign aid, these NGOs, charitable organizations, and the intergovernmental financial institutions (IMF, U.N., World Bank, etc.) should really focus on developing these nations economies through business/industry/innovation, and job creation. Of course that would defeat the entire purpose of their AID INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. 3.5 Stars for this documentary, but 1 star in actuality because it fails to address the most important issue of LOGISTICS.",1515628800,,2318,5.118733509234828

7580829,3,B019RGCZ3M,"The movie raises some interesting points about the state of institutional humanitarian aid.  I was hoping for a balanced analysis of the possible rights and wrongs that happen in development, but the analysis is very one-sided (""teach a man how to fish""). Very quickly the whole movie becomes a repetitive declaration of how NGOs destroy local business.",1514937600,,353,5.192982456140351
7580830,5,B019RGCZ3M,In the commercial world we would call selling things at below cost dumping and is illegal because it is used to destroy competition.  In the NGO/Foreign aid business we call this charity.  Pretty messed up.,1514851200,,206,4.857142857142857
7580831,5,B019RGCZ3M,"Once you watch this you will never ever have to feel guilty if you don't donate to charity. I donate every now and then at the grocery stores when a clerk asks if I want to round up but I usually try to keep my charity distributions to a local level as I try to also buy locally.  Obviously this is involving money not blood, which blood banks are almost always in need of donation (of blood).

It was a very informative watch; if you have watched other documentaries before or understand the basic principles of economy you should hopefully already know most of this, particularly that it's best to do business locally.

The best part of this was the graphs and the ladder they used to illustrate the system.  The most confusing part of this documentary was some of the people who were interviewed asking NGOs what they were doing about people being unable to buy land; this and other things on the ladder appear to be rooted in that country and the leaders that have been put into place or, in sixteen of the countries, elected through voting. I'm confused how any charity or social entrepreneur is going to change the rule of law on a local level; that seems very much like a local issue that needs to be addressed by the people living in that area.

All in all, very good film, highly informative, I hope it changes some people's perspectives on charities and makes them think twice and do the extra research one should do before donating to any cause.  A lot of times it's just easier to donate locally as you can usually see the effect it has as opposed to large international aid where you can't see the effect but you also never know where your money is actually going.",1514764800,3,1677,4.4462540716612375

7580843,4,B019RGCZ3M,"Ok, so I read one of the scathing negative reviews and it made me want to watch this documentary. The point as I was watching is that they wanted to discuss more specifically the problem in Africa of receiving too much of the wrong kind of aid, and that much of the aid that they receive actually perpetuates dependence and poverty. They want to change the image of their country from one of ""dependent and incompetent to help themselves"" to a country that is actually included in global trade on a larger scale. They feel that the aid provided has fostered a ""dependence economy"".

I'm not sure where I stand on this issue even after watching it, and I do think that we in the US need to concentrate on the people here living in poverty. There are plenty of homeless that are desperate for aid and probably cant sustain employment. Why are we not filtering these types of resources to those people? I would much rather see my money stay in the US helping people around me.

I think all they are saying is that they want the chance to succeed on their own and they appreciate the aid and the hearts of the people, but they mostly just want to be included in the global economy, and don't really want our old clothes. Even though it gets a bit repetitive in places, its worth a watch for sure.",1513468800,,1292,4.379166666666666

7580845,1,B019RGCZ3M,"The good things of this documentary are already known to development economists: current foreign aid (as we know it today) and dependency are not adequate development strategies. However, there are many shortfalls: 1. this documentary may mislead unfamiliar viewers to believe that almost all type of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) are doing ""more harm than good"", while there are many (perhaps a majority) of NGOs complementing (not substituting) local efforts in favor of development. Of course, NGOs are not the solution, but are not harming the solution in many instances (e.g., providing free vaccines to rural populations). 2. lack of strong academic evidence make them generalize anecdotes, failing in ""fallacies of composition"". 3. wrongly stated that the solution for poor countries is in strengthening property rights and free trade. China (among other relatively successful development examples) has done quite different: reverse engineering and controlling trade, not blindly engaging in free trade. 4. Fail to mention that what we need is to restructure foreign aid so that it complement local capacity (e.g., buying food to local farmers), not remove it completely. In conclusion, the documentary is very simplistic and can mislead many good people to believe wrong ideas that few development economists believe in nowadays.",1511222400,3,1343,5.620689655172414

I laughed and we settled on something else. But I came back to this on my own later, and boy am I glad I gave it a chance.

This film was so well done, so easy to watch, and so thought-provoking. It's challenged me to think about poverty and developing nations differently. I'm really glad I took the time to watch it. It's one of my all-time favorite documentaries because it really makes you reconsider how you look at the world. Even if you just watch the first half hour or 45 minutes, you'll be better off for it.

In the US, people want jobs so they can support themselves and their families.  And we know that living off of government support or other handouts robs people of their dignity and creates an entitlement mindset.

So, why would it be different in Africa or Haiti?

I like that the goal was not to demonize those who want to help.  I like that their generosity and desire to do good things is acknowledged and appreciated.  However, the way we go about it needs to change and we need to understand the consequences of what we do.

One of the things that's always frustrated me about watching documentaries, and even the news sometimes, is that solutions are rarely given after stories of horror/poverty.  If solutions are given, it's a toss-up as to how effective they would actually be (turns out probably not that effective).  I felt this movie gave understandable but large scale solutions.  No 'click here to donate then go about your lives having contributed to ending global poverty and eased your guilt' easy outs.  The solutions to the issues of third world poverty are not simple and not something one person can help solve with donations.  They are systemic problems with charities, governments, and an ill-informed public.  We all know how difficult it can be to change such things.  What you can do on a personal level it seems is to stop feeding 'Poverty Inc' and to support businesses like the ones shown.  I wonder where to buy those necklaces?

Poor in areas of Asia like India are poised to prosper in the next 50 years as the political world changes, but in all projections (not covered in this documentary) no one sees development for sub-Saharan Africa. Why? Also not stated in this documentary, but it is easy to see the answer: racism. Getting away from that, it shows how much of charity is as corrupt as most systems with a simple inquiry into que bono. If you're not familiar with the world of charity, it is very enlightening, and focuses on foreign aid. If you're curious how the world really works, and how America impacts the world, this is a great documentary to give you one view of it all.",1492646400,2,880,4.647435897435898
7580873,2,B019RGCZ3M,"It had the potential to be a great documentary, and it makes a valid point about the poverty industry (yes, it is definitely a profitable industry), but it ends up being a bunch of black-racist bullcrap. This film makes it VERY, very clear that the ONLY people who are poor, and the ONLY people who are being taken advantage of by this poverty industry system are BLACK. You want me to believe that there are no white, brown, yellow, or red people born and raised in Africa, often 2-3 generations in? You want me to believe that NONE of them are poor? You want me to believe that this same poverty industry is not hard at work making money in the U.S., UK, Canada, Europe, Asia, or the Middle East? That is EXACTLY what this ""documentary"" is saying. Complete nonsense. This poverty industry is GLOBAL, creating poverty everywhere. Do you know of only one industry that is only profitable in one country? I don't. If you do, please tell me, show it. What is the one industry that is only profitable in one country to the IMF? NONE, that's how many. The poverty industry is no different. This is all connected to the UN's Sustainable Development (Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030) and Human Resettlement Programme. You think you are not controlled by the UN, because you live in the U.S. or Europe? A tiny town like Delevan, WI has a UN-led Sustainable 2030 plan already in place. Every city does now, all over the world. Don't like it? Think you are free? Go ahead and try to step out of THEIR system to take care of yourself, and see what happens. In the U.S., there's a 70+ yr old guy doing hard PRISON time for collecting RAIN WATER on his own property! Cities all over the globe are (unlawfully) making it illegal for you to take care of yourself and your family OUTSIDE OF THEIR SYSTEM. You can take care of yourself, as long as you do it in their system, using their industries, so they are making money off of you no matter what. If you approve of this system in the U.S., then you MUST approve of this in Africa, or anywhere else. That sob story about a woman not being able to find a T-shirt that says, ""Made in Haiti""? Really? How hard is it for you to find a T-shirt in America that does not say it was made elsewhere? Because there was such a backlash about that here, did Congress or the President enable more cotton and textile production in America? No, nor anything else. They just changed the rules of their game to allow other countries to cheaply ship the PIECES of the product into the country, ASSEMBLE it here, and still call it ""Made in America"". They are killing our economy just as fast. Every State in America has received a failing grade in infrastructure. Self-sufficiency practices that would keep the poor off of the government system has been made illegal. That's the basic human right that is being stolen - NO MATTER YOUR COUNTRY OR RACE. White people are NOT doing this to black people. The mega-rich are doing this to everyone else, and the mega-rich are of every color skin. This is not the rich against the poor, this is the rich getting richer by making everyone else poor. This film describes this, but it has just as much of a slanted AGENDA as the mega-rich do. There is NO difference between this film's agenda and the mega-rich's agenda. It isn't about what is right for humanity, individual people, or anything else. This group is a black-supremacist group, no better than the KKK. They don't see people as individuals; they only see ""whites are rich and evil"" while ""blacks are oppressed and poor"". I am not going to overlook this agenda/propaganda, like other reviewers did, simply because it has a good message ""also"". That is exactly how the elite tricked people into going along with their agenda, and what got us into this mess. You have to question ANY agenda that only benefits one group, and restricts another. Every human being has a RIGHT to life, which means no other human/government/agency/whatever has the authority to take-away/restrict/regulate ANY essential element to life: air, water, food, shelter, security. If you see a ""law""/rule/statute/code/etc that regulates or restricts any of those, for any reason, at any time, in any country, you know that is an UNLAWFUL action, and hence null and void. All of them. Putting a costume on someone and giving them a gun does not alter a human's rights at any time in any location on the planet, or give them the authority to take away any human right. Elected or not, no ""official"" in any government has the authority to take away or regulate any human right at any time for any reason, including war and ""unrest"". The elite have been so successful in taking away and restricting human rights, there is not one place on the planet where people do not accept at least a small measure of this based on one excuse or another (usually safety/security/fear). This is a global problem, affecting everyone who isn't mega-rich, of all races. This film does not just focus on black people, it specifically blames ""the West"" and whites. It has an agenda in favor of one group AT THE EXPENSE OF everyone else. They are no different than the IMF's poverty industry machine. It is this 'everyone is out for themselves' attitude that is keeping the corrupt machines going.

I'd actually like to spend the bulk of this review dispelling potential criticisms.
One might criticize the film for not raising many solutions; I do not think that was their goal. I think that their goal, as shown through the documentary style, including interviews with many individuals from third world countries, was to demonstrate that there is a real problem and to hint that any solution must come about through dialogue with the people of those countries. One could also fault the film for what it left out: there were very few Asian countries referenced, the power of big business (not poverty alleviation businesses but multinational corporations) to protect its interests, and likely many other issues were not even raised. Good points. However, that is just to complain. How much can one film cover in 90 min? As the film stands, it provides a wonderful introduction to an incredibly complex and vexing problem. The problem has many facets; this film helps us begin to scratch the surface.

7580920,5,B019RGCZ3M,"All is not good in the world and especially in the world where the west is supposedly lifting, supporting and helping the ""3rd world"" folks. As Poverty Inc. repeats often the west started out with good and compassionate intentions, to give and help the very, very destitute in Haiti, Africa and elsewhere. Yet destitution persists.

Why?

Maybe we in the west are doing things for ourselves, to salve our conscience or to do something quick and move on. The real reason destitution persists is that dumping worldly goods on others does not solve their long-term issue that the systems in their own countries persist in keeping the foot on their necks.

I remember reading that to start an effective system for the people would be to have laws to support surveyors laying out the property for the people so that clear title descends on the property that folks have occupied and used for years. However, they would never invest in that property because as soon as it has some value, the murky title means they could lose it. They just cannot see the future without clear title.

Of course, some would sell their property immediately. However, they could work for their neighbor who would be developing his owned assets into useful business and commerce. All boats would rise.

Poverty Inc. alludes to this sort of justice.

The case study of the church sending chickens that were sold too cheaply, running the local farmer out of business, then stopping and now no one has chickens is clearly where the wrong approach of parachuting goods in from the west is a poor long-term solution.

You'll see great examples of how Big Government subsidies that were given to rice farmers in the US have ruined the rice business in African countries. As soon as Africa received free rice in the form of charity from the US, the local rice farms went out of business.

Another great example is that of an egg farmer. He had a lot of hens that were laying many eggs which he in turn sold to locals in the village. But after hundreds of eggs were dropped off from the charity airplane, he quickly went out of business.

African economists have been warning the West for years that charity was the wrong way to help Africa - most African countries are dictatorships and those dictators decide what happens with the charity.

The film also cited ""rule of law"" as one of the determining factors for poverty levels.  A sovereign nation's ""rule of law"" is not for aid organizations to address,  If one is going to skirt around addressing the actual governments of the African nations (i.e., the governing body that determine ""rule of law"" in a given nation) by pretending that the ""rule of law"" is some commodity, and fail to mention China's presence in those countries whilst they are at it, why bring up the ""rule of law"" as a contributing factor to anything?? Government and those that govern play a much larger role in poverty in any given country that does ""aid"" - if poverty is your concern, that is.  You get the sincere feeling that the film's message is that the corrupt foreign aid industry, alone, births all poverty.

7580948,1,B019RGCZ3M,"This does not hit at the heart of the poverty issue.  I think the most ridiculous part was the discussion surrounding Haiti.  It was suggested that the aid that poured in after the earthquake left the country in a state of ""helplessness"".  It was inferred that all of the world aid left Haiti's people unable to support themselves independently.  Haiti has long been a underdeveloped country.....long before the earthquake.  To assume that the current state is a result of that earthquake and the world aid that came in after, is absolutely absurd.  Instead of focusing on the excuses of why we are not part of the developed world, maybe the conversation needs to be more action oriented.  Perhaps we need to ask ourselves, ""What can we DO to MAKE ourselves part of the developed world?""  If all one has is an excuse, one renders himself completely incapable of moving forward.

Development, global health, and poverty alleviation are never as easy as throwing money and resources at the situation. This film addresses the issue of paternalism from various points of view, from governments to nonprofits to charities to celebrities and beyond. The film focuses mainly on issues in Haiti, rightly justified since this is a place of great development strife, especially since the earthquake of 2010, but as a viewer I would have liked to have seen perspectives from a wider range of countries and cultures than those offered (mostly Haiti and the continent of Africa). Further, I believe the subject of education and how transferring from a system of paternalism to a system of empowerment will look could have been addressed more. Also, the fact that resources and demand have to come from somewhere was not well analyzed: if NOT from developed countries, then where, AND if from developed countries, then how?

For those who are serious about impacting poverty in a positive way, Poverty Inc. is moving, challenging and at time uncomfortable to view, but you won't regret the experience.

I use both Poverty Cure and now Poverty Inc,  in my university economics courses.  It give students a context they would never receive from lectures, texts and homework assignments.  It encourages them to do excellent work in their studies as they now can see that the course material really matters, and getting economics wrong truly impacts living souls for the negative.  It inspires them to think bigger, to think beyond themselves and to think how they too might make a difference in the world.

7580979,5,B019RGCZ3M,Great documentary,1461715200,,17,8.0
7580980,5,B019RGCZ3M,"This powerful documentary illustrates the old adage that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and although the good intentions of many supporters of global charities may be undeniable, there is much that goes on behind the scenes that is less than admirable. Poverty, Inc. delves into origins, workings, players and ramifications of what has become a global poverty industry, comprised of aid agencies, NGOs, charities, corporations, governments, and even social entrepreneurs and celebrities.

When natural catastrophes strike, massive and immediate humanitarian aid is of course essential, but, unfortunately, there are aspects of chronic institutionalized aid that are much less benign, and this documentary is a real eye-opener. Aid can become an impediment to the rehabilitation of local economies when, for example, handouts of rice or shoes put local farmers and shoemakers out of business. Who can compete with free? Similar things also happen when aid is tied to bilateral agreements, and highly subsidized crops are dumped on local markets. Its great for U.S. agribusiness and contractors, but disastrous in the long term for the country receiving the aid.

The postwar Marshall Plan for European aid was ostensibly intended to build infrastructure, but in effect became the foundation for neocolonialism. The film suggests that foreign aid has become the cornerstone for the Wests engagement with the Third World. In a sinister twist, such aid is often tied into loans from the IMF that encourages corruption, enriching the countrys leaders but crippling its economy. This has a domino effect whereby countries that are unable to repay these loans are forced to sell off their natural resources, which in turn reduces even further their ability to repay even the interest on the loans, excluding them even further from the global financial markets and perpetuating their dependency on foreign aid.

The film interviews many eloquent and passionate activists and entrepreneurs who have the skills to rebuild their economies but are hampered by not having access to capital in their countries. If they can get loans, interest rates can be as high as 120% a year. Another barrier they face is that the rule of law doesnt seem to work for poor people. They don't get justice in the courts, property rights can be a terrible problem, and only the rich can navigate the complex legal structures that are built upon institutionalized corruption.

Africa is a continent rich in resources and land. It needs help in job creation rather than donations that perpetuate dependency. No one, they point out, wants to be a beggar for life. There are a few of NGOs that do train technicians and support businesses, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule. There is a gap between small-scale micro financing and big company financing. The space in between is filled with small and medium enterprises that have proven to be the engine of growth of any economy. Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank and pioneer of microfinance, says Poor people are bonsai people. Society doesnt provide them the base (to grow in) so they remain stunted.

Because poor people are often excluded from networks of productivity and exchange, providing them with access to cell phones, Internet, banks, financial systems, and educational systems would go a long way towards enabling local entrepreneurship and changing the culture of dependency. Even well-meaning celebrities are taken to task in the film for subtly reinforcing for poor people a self-image that they are not good enough to be able to help themselves.

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, says the parable, but teach him to fish and you feed him for life. This documentary makes a powerful argument for radically rethinking our financial and political support of the charities and NGOs that drive the poverty industry. Obviously disasters will always happen, but we are urged to see the difference between a compassionate response to a crisis, and undermining the resilience and ability of a people to rebuild their communities and their lives. This film is essential viewing for charities and NGOs, and an ah-ha experience for the rest of us.",1461628800,,4223,5.139737991266376

This documentary shows in various and heartbreaking ways the difference between pity and compassion. Stephen Levine said, ""When you touch someone's suffering with fear, you feel pity. When you touch someone's suffering with love, you feel compassion."" There's a huge difference between extending a hand-up rather than a hand-out. A hand- out tells someone they're not capable of helping themselves. You rob them of their dignity, self-worth and self-empowerment. When you give people a hand-up, you are partnering with them and helping them become the hero of their own story. The difference is so astounding, it makes you wonder why it's taken us so long to understand this twisted approach to ending poverty, when the word itself (meaning 'inferior') is demeaning to the human spirit. Perhaps those of us who are benefitting from the war on poverty, are either ignorant, unconscious, or morally corrupt.",1461283200,,1018,5.251533742331288

7580989,5,B019RGCZ3M,"In the past, when I had read stories about how surplus items would be sent to poor countries, I had not really thought about the impact it had on the local producers of similar items. For example, after a Super Bowl game, clothing announcing the losing team as winners (since these are made up in advance) are shipped in bulk to Africa and South America. What effect does this have on local clothing makers? Poverty, Inc. gives the answer, and it isn't pretty. The distributor sent me a copy and asked for a review.

As the video repeatedly says, the donors are doing this with good intentions - mostly - but there's too much opportunity for self-serving profit and marketing at the expense of the locals who CAN help themselves with just a little boost (and less competition from being flooded with cheap or free items.) The story about the egg farmer who lost his business when a church decided to ship in free eggs, before moving on to the next ""act of charity"", had me shaking my head in despair.

I recognize that this film has a point of view and expresses it well, but it does quote some long-time luminaries in the ""charity business"" who admit that simply shipping goods to the poor is not a long-term solution.

7581003,5,B019RGCZ3M,"This looked like an interesting and important film, so I decided to check it out when I was offered the chance. I find it to be well written and acted, with a critical message for helping the poor, but that it looked a bit ragged on my PC.

The film documents the current state of affairs on helping ""third world"" countries. They specifically mention Africa and Haiti as examples. Using in person interviews both of people who have been part of the ""help"", and those who were supposed to be ""helped"", they show that the current method of international aid is in fact hurting the very people it is supposed to help. They do a great job with laying out their case step-by-step, in clear language and with easy to grasp concepts. The result is that your jaw will (or should) drop open in disbelief that things could get so bad - that people with the best intentions are in fact hurting the very people they want to help. If the message gets through, you will never look at the ""poor"" in ""third world"" nations the same way again, and will want to use the head as well as the heart in helping the world improve.

The film feeds into the current distrust of big corporations, but in an unexpected way. In fact, the international aid situation has become the same as a huge corporation, with rules and methods that are ingrained, and a firm belief that their way is the proper way. It is a juggernaut, and at this point there is a lot of money involved, which means it would be very hard to stop.  This is one thing the film does NOT do - it really doesn't directly suggest a plan. They primarily show how the system is broken, and speak of what needs to be done, but present no concept of just how we are supposed to get from where we are to where they indicate (very believably) we need to be.

What struck me was that the film speaks about foreign aid, but many of the concepts could just as easily apply to the current welfare system here in the United States, where the concept of ""giving away"" to the poor is the same, when what is needed is a way to get the poor out of poverty. And it makes me wonder if here too, we have another branch of ""poverty, inc"".

The only issue I had with the film is likely my PC, and not the production of the disc itself. It tended to skip a bit. But I hardly noticed, because the content was so good.

Summary: If you really have a heart for the poor, this film is the critical first step to helping. Highly recommended.

In fact, it was shocking how sending free food, shoes or other items can actually have a worse impact on the economy of the place you are sending it to than if you did nothing. Great explanation as to how this happens.

Also really shocking to hear about how the celebrities are part of the problem. Most are doing heartfelt workI do believe thatbut they are being used by the system to perpetuate it. Hearing the experts gang up on Bono was something else, they really let him have it!

The overall production value is right up among the best I have ever seen. My only complaint was the audio. I kept having to fiddle with the volume throughout the movie since in places it was too low/highneeds to be leveled better. Also, some interviews had two audio tracks. At times an interview had lots of room noise or reverb, and then a few sentences in loud crisp audio, then go back to low/noisy vocals.

I received this movie at a discount to evaluate and provide an unbiased and honest review. This review was written by me and of my own opinion after viewing this movie in its entirety. The movie being offered at a discount did NOT sway my opinions in any way.",1459036800,,1267,4.382978723404255
7581006,5,B019RGCZ3M,"A well-made, beautiful movie about how compassion has degenerated into self-serving governments and NGOs harming the poor they are supposed to help. Aid, hand outs, and ""free stuff"" put local businesses and craftsmen out of work, because no one can compete with free.

The movie shows that the poor in developing countries need jobs. A successful software entrepreneur says that he never heard of a country becoming developed through foreign aid. It would be better to make it as easy as possible for them to sell stuff to us, and eliminate all the sneaky subsidies that allow big US companies to compete unfairly with local businesses.

The movie also shows how important property rights are, so people can have collateral that will allow them to access credit, and grow small businesses. Fair laws is also both essential and rare. In many developing countries it is almost impossible to engage in business legally without having to wade through a pile of red tape so large that it would be comic if there weren't so many people starving as a result. A Nobel prize-winning economist in Peru (I think) hired someone to do the leg work necessary to get all the documentation necessary to run a sewing shop with two sewing machines and two seamstresses. It took 289 days, working 8 hours per day.

The movie is upbeat, and packed with of colorful, inspiring characters. There's a woman who runs a jewelry factory in Haiti, the ""Bill Gates of Africa,"" some old British guys, and an anthropologist who talks like a Brooklyn gangster. Watch it.",1458950400,,1539,4.844106463878327

And one can extend that aphorism to include ""give a man a net and he can feed himself, his family and the village! ""

This documentary shows how charities can make people dependent on outside agencies. And this aid, despite good intentions, can inadvertently eliminate jobs in the very communities they are serving.  Many international experts in the field are interviewed.  There is also remarkable comments by former President Clinton and the singer Bono in this film. Immediate aid after a natural disaster is fine but to continue doing so for years and years afterwards indicates something is not working in the economy. Long term aid fosters a ""nanny state"" and indigenous people lose their incentive to improve.

And it is not easy to know what to do or how to do it unless you live among them and establish strong, reciprocal relationships with them. Walk in their shoes first. Don't talk, listen.

As a person inclined to be generous to the poor, I'd like to think my money is doing good not harm to those who are supposed to be benefiting.  This documentary shows that this is not always the case and that there is a system of NGO's in place in some poor countries that are interested in something other than ""teaching a man to fish"" instead of just feeding him a fish.  It's tragic and this problem needs to be rectified after careful study.  When the donations pouring into Haiti prevent local businesses from surviving because they cannot compete with ""free"" there is a problem.  When ""free"" comes for a year and wipes out a local business which cannot compete with free and then the following year is gone, the local business has already gone out of business and cannot start supplying the need again.

It shows that we need to consider the people we are trying to help with our charity, not just export our own agenda on them as if they don't have gifts and talents of their own and need to depend on us to thrive.  The video shows how charity can really have a negative effect, if you don't consider the people you are giving to and if you use aid as a permanent system, rather then temporary disaster relief.  The movie also proposes that what people in poverty need most is access to markets and not to be excluded from circles of exchange either by dictators or corrupt governments.  The sad part of the video is the revelation that the US and other nations have sometimes subsidized these corrupt governments and dictators in the form of global aid.

The answers are not necessarily forthcoming in this movie, nor should they be. It is enough of a service to frame the problem so that others will ask that very question. It may just be that the sort of scale-efficiency we have been taught to honor and revere as the right way in business may in fact be wrong for poverty alleviation.

7581059,5,B019RGCZ3M,"I watched Poverty, Inc. last night. For me, as a Christian, getting compassion right is a really important part of following Jesus.  So many of Gods children are really in distress around the world.  If you don't share my faith conviction, watch this movie out of self-interest.  We can see reports every day of ways that the ignorance, resentment and medical epidemics that breed in desperately poor regions are a threat to us, here in the USA.

The main impact of the film is to warn against interventions that do more harm than good.  Watch the film to learn about that or read the other reviews.  The alarms raised in the movie can help you channel your giving to the most useful places and I assume they will have an impact on the big institutions like the World Bank and IMF.  This film can do a lot of good at these points.

I want to add several points where I wish the film had gone further in giving guidance of how to respond to its message.  I make these points in the full recognition that this is a very complex issue and a complete treatment would take many hours.

I have already heard too many people say that helping impoverished countries is a waste of time.  Poverty, Inc. lays out many of the complexities of foreign aid and it would be easy to use it as an excuse to give up.  I hear the film calling us, not to give up on foreign aid, but to do it more wisely.  It is not an excuse for cold-heartedness.

And I would want to expand on the solutions offered in the film.  The emphasis for solving world poverty was on encouraging small enterprise.  Thats an excellent goal.  It will appeal to those with a political philosophy that emphasizes free enterprise as opposed to big institutions.  But there are other essential approaches that lay foundations for small enterprise.  I have worked with Christian missions in impoverished nations.  Christian missionaries have empowered millions of people through education.  In many developing nations a large percent of the medical workers and community development workers are local people who have been trained and empowered by mission agencies.  Christian missionaries have saved many lives through medical care.  Christian missions have helped families get started in raising chickens, goats or cattle so they can become self-sufficient and asked them to share animals with their neighbors as they build up their stock.  Christian missionaries have helped many people find the moral structure in their lives that lays a foundation for economic success.

Finally, the introduction to the film shows scenes and logos of many groups that provide assistance, with the implication that they are the problem.  I was distressed to see the logo for World Vision flash by in that segment.  Later in the film microloans were held up as one of the useful forms of assistance. Well, World Vision provides microloans and many other services that genuinely empower people.  In the discussion following the video someone asked the presenter about another one of those organizations that had its logo flashed.  The presenter said that those logos were not placed there for criticism, but to demonstrate the size of the compassion movement.  There are many effective opportunities for us to support ministries that can really make a difference.  Just be wise.

Overall, Poverty, Inc. is an eye-opening, important contribution to the essential task of addressing world poverty.",1456272000,,3429,4.889081455805893

But it makes sense--why would you buy local products if you can have them given to you for free? Those are just two of the many powerful examples presented in this fine film.

They would demand an end to corrupt police forces and government license rajs. They would demand property rights for everyone.

In the past humanity has thought that throwing lots of money at poverty was the way to solve it. However, more and more research is showing this is rarely the best solution, and yet we still do it. I know I was guilty of it for years.

Now, I work for an organization that aims to sustainably relieve poverty in the developing world by helping create jobs. Explaining why our methods are valuable to people who are believers in traditional charity methods has not been easy, but this documentary has been such a helpful tool in helping transition people's understanding.

While the film discusses challenging topics, it is family friendly, interesting, and easy to watch. It takes the high road and doesn't get into ""poverty porn"" and it doesn't depend on pity or sympathy to tell it's stories. It doesn't have easy answers, but creates lots of space for conversation.

A few favorite quotes:
""Your goal should be to teach me how to fish and then move out. But if you're still here after 40 years, then there's a problem.""
""I don't know of any country that developed on aid.""
""If you really want to help poverty, the poverty industry as we know it must end.""

Seriously.

I truly believe that Poverty, Inc. will completely shift the mindset of individuals around the world, and change the common misconceptions regarding poverty, its underlying causes, and steps towards restoration. From a personal point of view, I have always found the concept of sending trained American professionals to assist the helpless natives absolutely repulsive.  While researching organizations that I personally support and would consider future employment, the concept of Indigenous Leadership has always been an extremely important issue to me.  Initially, I somewhat dreaded watching this film because of the helplessness and absolute sadness I generally feel after watching something concerning those suffering around the world.  However, this film was completely different, because it provided a fresh, new perspective on why the past efforts have been unsuccessful, and laid out steps concerning how we can practically change the way we contribute to the success of developing countries in the future.

While I cannot deny that certain information provided in this film made me emotional and depressed, my overall feeling is excited that there are opportunities for impoverished countries to advance in some truly incredible ways if individuals around the world are willing to humble ourselves to submit to the unstoppable force of empowerment of the people, and support developing countries as the locals (experts of their own communities) see fit.

Although I had some knowledge of the ""Poverty Industry"" prior to the film, I learned many new things.  This film opened my eyes to seeing economically oppressed people in a new light- they are not tools and means to cheap labor, they should not be victims of exploitation, nor should they be ignored.  We should instead approach the poor as co-equals in a global economy with focus on fair market exchange of goods and services.  Human beings are on both sides every exchange and we need to change our approach to poverty to respect that!  The content, interviews and stories are captured brilliantly.

7581105,4,B019RGCZ3M,"Excellent film about the unintended consequences of treating poverty only as a material issue (i.e. I have extra stuff - I give you stuff - I feel better about myself).  It is about changing the dynamic of our relationships from giver (superior) to receiver (inferior) to a two way partnership with both parties growing from the relationship.  It also lays bare the American system of crop subsidies and how that distorts both local and international food prices.  Dumping extra grain and rice in other countries through USAID puts local producers out of business.

Giving away shoes destroys local shoe manufacturers.

While not mentioned in the movie you can see the huge negative impact on poverty in the US by the Sugar lobby in keeping prices high for the benefit of sugar cane kings in Florida and sugar beet barons in Minnesota and North Dakota.  Most of the candy manufacturers in Chicago have now closed good paying manufacturing plants and moved them to Mexico where sugar is closer to market price.

The movies is beautifully shot and very challenging to normal assumptions about how to alleviate poverty.  One of my favorite quotes from the movie is along the lines of ""no country in the history of the world has ever grown it's way out of poverty through aid"".

I highly recommend this movie and it's sister series Poverty Cure : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1938948289?keywords=poverty%20cure&qid=1455729902&ref_=sr_1_1&s=movies-tv&sr=1-1",1455667200,13,1456,5.2956521739130435
7581106,5,B019RGCZ3M,"I require my entire team of international development professionals, both field and office personnel, to watch the film, Poverty, Inc., in order to have them better understand just how destructive development aid can be, who is responsible for the harm this aid causes and who benefits the most. The revelations in Poverty, Inc. mirror my own experiences and those of our field staff. I urge you to watch this film when it is released to the public starting March 1st.

Milton Friedman, the 1976 Nobel Laureate in economics, said that soft hearts when coupled with soft heads and with the best intentions frequently lead to harmful unintended consequences.  Tibetan Buddhists have another blunter name for this behavior, idiot compassion. What our team has come to realize through experience is that good intentions are not enough and that rigorous, objective monitoring and reviewing of development initiatives are needed to weed out those activities that don't help and often harm. This is hard to do when ones livelihood may depend on the continuation of these activities, as it does for many in the international development industry.

Drawing from over 200 interviews filmed in 20 countries, Poverty, Inc. unearths an uncomfortable side of international charity we can no longer ignore.  The film stems from a larger initiative focused on unlocking the creative potential of the person as the key to human thriving vs. outright charity handouts.

Too often, the worlds attention seems to stop at good intentions. Without looking deeper, many remain unaware of the harm governments or well-meaning non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can do with funds that are gladly turned over to development professionals whose programs can ultimately wreak havoc on developing countries. One such country spotlighted in the film, Haiti, is derisively known within the development community as the Republic of NGOs.  No one really know how many NGOs operate there, but the number is certainly in the thousands. But what is certain is that little actual development has occurred through these NGOs since the devastating 2010 earthquake, but the pretentions go on and on and on, as do the development jobs in Haiti.

Nevertheless, not all NGOs are inefficient and we certainly shouldnt disregard the great work some are capable of doing, but monitoring and evaluation of their activities is absolutely necessary.  There are many excellent examples of NGOs doing great things to alleviate poverty around the world, including Fonkoze in Haiti, who now serves over 60,000 entrepreneurs.  CASHPOR from Varanasi, India is another outstanding NGO who focuses on the poorest of the poor by providing small business loans that have no asset seizure for nonpayment, while also providing assistance in healthcare, sanitation and business management counseling.  The same can be said for the work One Acre Fund is doing in Africa assisting subsistence farmers to double their yields or more by using proven intensive farming techniques, tools and seeds. Pro Mujer in Latin America is doing substantial microfinance work in many countries. And BRAC from Bangladesh, another excellent microfinance organization, has branched out into several African and other Asian countries with great results.

The film Poverty, Inc. clearly, adroitly and articulately lays bare the real economic development industry that is ostensibly charged with ending poverty. In truth, international development aid, called dead aid by Zambian global economist Dambisa Moyo, is often at best ineffective, and at its worst, a swindle that is now known widely as poverty inc., a lucrative multibillion-dollar enterprise benefiting many except the poor that it claims to help.",1455667200,4,3727,5.38659793814433

All of us who attended our screening were challenged to begin evaluating each opportunity that is brought before us to now make sure we're being a part of the solution and not adding to the problem.

7581111,5,B019RGCZ3M,"I had dinner with a filmmaker friend recently, and he made the case that Poverty, Inc. was the best film presenting an intellectual argument ever made.  I don't claim to have the depth of knowledge regarding documentaries that he has, but it is certainly a plausible claim.

Poverty, Inc. explains many of the problems with the foreign aid industry as we know it by means of compelling anecdotes and interviews.  I'm deeply familiar with the issues in the film - my wife, Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade, appears in the film.  Thus for me the content itself was not new.  Magatte and I discuss them almost every day.  But it is a gift that these issues are finally reaching a broader audience.  Our hope is that once the fraudulent and damaging approaches to poverty alleviation are unmasked that finally caring people can begin to support real solutions.

My one concern is that those solutions may not be as clearly articulated as they might have been - I have seen some viewers come away from the film simply confused and despairing.  For a more substantial introduction to aligned solutions, viewers should read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mystery-of-Capital-Why-Capitalism-Triumphs-in-the-West-and-Fails-Everywhere-Else/dp/B00CW0MA1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else</a>.

Donated goods and services flow in, but often these ""free"" things put local entrepreneurs and professionals out of work. While temporary aid can help after a tragedy or unexpected event - it cannot be a long-term solution. No country has ever developed because they received ""enough"" aid.

You cannot watch this film and not have your views challenged. The aha moment is realizing that chronically impoverished people living under corrupt regimes in which the lack of basic property rights inhibits markets economies are JUST LIKE US.

7581127,5,B019RGCZ3M,"As Frederick Bastiat wrote long ago, an act produces a number of effects: some are immediate and readily apparent and others are subsequent, often obscure.  If the immediate result seems favorable, it is imbued with a power that controls our reaction to it in such a way that any talk of unforeseen consequences is rendered as foolish or insensitive.  A narrative can be easily created around an image of the present but it is not as simple with what lies ahead. The TV commercial with the line It is my money and I want it now! is emblematic of this reality.

Some good people see the bags of food given at a food distribution center or the massive cargo of aid dumped in foreign lands and experience an immediate and pleasant illusion of success. What they miss is the jobs destroyed by the subtractions of resources from the market economy, the faces of tired entrepreneurs fighting a too powerful competitor.  As these jobs and these people are often anonymous, spread as they are throughout the social landscape, it is easy to deny that there is a loss.  The slogans used to show that we care for the hungry are synecdoches, figures of speech that narrow the discussion of the problems to a single characteristic focusing either on emotional responses. Moreover, if government aid is sold as a jobs creation program that puts some people to work in a given government office, there is an incentive to perpetuate what ought to be temporary.

In other words, the goal of aid coated with a veneer of advertisement, lofty, engaging and focused, defeats any day any discussion on effectiveness or long-term effects. Yes, Etienne Gilson was correct in stating that piety is no substitute for technique, but piety does a great job at camouflaging! If, years later, anyone tries to end the program the opposition will be fierce with accusations of a lack of concern for the poor, and a desire to turn back the clock. The fact that the clock is tied to a ticking bomb of economic erosion can be dismissed because, again, it is not seen.

That is the reality insightfully examined by Poverty Cures outstanding film, Poverty, Inc. You must give yourself a favor by watching it, praying with it, and move into action at your church or civic group to raise awareness about a better waythe way of the entrepreneur. In colorful ways, happy ways, hopeful ways, Poverty, Inc. gives voice to those fighting for a better way, for a way built by the poor themselves. A renewal of our minds is needed to bridge the gap between good intentions and the mirage of immediacy. Poverty, Inc., ought to be an essential element of that lofty task.",1455494400,,2623,4.701525054466231

Those who long to see poverty eradicated from our modern world!!
I'm gonna be candid here, I was appalled to think that there are so many people out there who are willfully keeping people in poverty in order to continue to profit on them!!! Yeah, I'd suspecting it before but to see how bad it really is and how it's being orchestrated right before my eyes was heartbreaking, I was disgusted and ashamed not to mention angry.

This movie encourages all of us to do some self-reflection and truly understand how we are accomplices to a system that digs a deeper whole for people living in poverty. It forces us to step out of our good intentions to really examine whether what we are doing is really helping the communities we are targeting.

The film makes no apologies for anecdotally presenting its viewpoint, featuring many success stories in the developing world along with examples where the current aid system undermines the exact people it's intended to benefit. This approach works incredibly well and leaves a strong impression.

Poverty, Inc. shines a light on the untapped human talent and potential in the developing world while reminding us that the best way to assist in human flourishing is not strictly through aid, but rather through bridging the gaps that cut underdeveloped communities off from the global economic system.  It reminds us of the importance of basic rights that we often take for granted (the right to private property, the right to buy/sell goods in a market system, etc.).

My eyes were further opened as Poverty, Inc. showed just how harmful those effects have been in perpetuating poverty rather than alleviating it. Poverty, Inc. doesn't stop there, it gets to the root of our disappointing efforts which is the mental framework upon which the current aide industry is built. It was humbling to see that the subconscious attitude of superiority that many of us have has translated into a system of aide that assumes the same. The system ends up sustaining poverty by undermining the efforts of the poor rather than supporting them in their own endeavors. There is no single solution to poverty, but the lack of large scale progress from favoring the current aide system should cause us to step back and reevaluate.

It was refreshing to hear this message directly from those affected by the actions of NGOs and the western world.  The documentary does a wonderful job of deconstructing the incentives of all the players in the ecosystem. It exposes flaws in the current approach taken by a majority of the charitable programs.

I have always been a big believer in ""Don't give a man a fish, teach a man to fish"". This movie provides some serious evidence to support that school of thought.

If you look at the film's Facebook page, people are applauding policies that are much more fashionable but equally disastrous, such as bans on the import of secondhand goods.

If this film inspires you to learn more about development issues and to question fashionable approaches, particularly if they use sanctimonious/bullying marketing or celebrity endorsements, then that's great. There aren't enough people who care enough to do that and as Theodore Dalyrymple mentions in the film, it takes years to understand the issues properly.
