3160233,1,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is an unpatriotic movie, a slap in the face of the Americans who had just fought World War II and were at the time of the its release fighting in the Korean War, preventing South Korean from becoming a nightmarish communist state like North Korea. The movie portrays the towns people as self-serving cowards who refuse to join the fight against the bad guys. The towns people represent the American people.

The movie came out in 1952 just 7 years after a half millions soldiers gave their lives to fight fascist Nazi Germany and Japan. American soldier who helped liberate German concentration camps. In movie theaters would have sat veterans of that war. And what they didn't understand was they were enjoying a movie that mocked and insulted them and their sacrifice. In addition, American soldiers were dying in the Korean War trying to fight the expansion of brutal communism. And just a couple years earlier seventeen American aircraft crashed and 31 Americans lost their lives during the Berlin Blockade, a blockaded imposed by Soviet communists.

Carl Foreman created the story of High Noon to get at Americans for the backlash against former communists in Hollywood. Foreman had been summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and he admitted having been a member of the American Communist Party. Given the sacrifice Americans made to destroy Hitlers military machine and rescue Jews from concentration camps, the movie can be considered not only unAmerican but a mocking of the American soldiers who sacrificed so much during those wars.

3160241,4,B0016MLIKM,"Pretty close to being the perfect Western. Classic good versus bad with moral and character overtones. Plus, its Gary Cooper. And bonus is Grace Kelly in a Western. If you haven't seen Grace Kelly in a movie, make that a priority (although maybe something other than this one). Can't give it 5 stars because Eastwood and the Duke created a certain cowboy character and Gary Cooper plays the hero in a way that those two never did in their movies. And Eastwood and Wayne are too much a part of our culture for anyone to surpass them even though Cooper's acting is better and the movie plot is better.",1515888000,,599,4.504587155963303

3160258,5,B0016MLIKM,One of my favorite westerns of all-time! One of Gary Cooper's best films!,1511395200,,73,4.6923076923076925
3160259,4,B0016MLIKM,"I first saw this film more than half a century ago, a few years after it was first released in 1952. It is one of those iconic American films  a Western  with pretty much clear-cut characters who wear the white hat (singular) and the black hats (plural), with a lot of hats on the darker shade of gray, worn by the towns people. It was produced by Stanley Kramer, written by Carl Foreman, and directed by Fred Zinnemann. Grace Kelly, before she married a Prince (of Monaco) was the lead actress. Lloyd Bridges, before Sea Hunt fame, was the Deputy Marshall. It is difficult to imagine anyone other than Gary Cooper wearing that one white hat, but it turns out he was the SIXTH choice, after John Wayne and Gregory Peck and three others had turned it down. And lawdy, the tricks half a century can play on the neurons. I remembered a classic one-on-one shoot-out on Main Street but that is from Gunsmoke! Actually, it was one against four, with some vital last-minute support from a woman who decided to stand by her man.

The setting is the small up-and-coming town of Hadleyville, in the Territory of New Mexico (of all places), though it was filmed in California. Some themes are eternal, it seems, like catch and release, - which is a currently complaint here in Albuquerque, about our criminal justice system, - and which was the impetus to the entire drama set back in the late 19th Century. Frank Miller wears the blackest hat, having been convicted of murder, sent up for life, sentence reduced, then paroled. He is making a bee-line to Hadleyville to settle some scores, and is arriving on the noon train, hence the films title. Three of his sidekicks are waiting at the train to assist. Meanwhile, Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) had already resigned as Marshall and had married Grace Kelly that morning. He could (and many say should) leave. But he just cant, despite the threats and nagging from his new wife. The Judge who sentenced Miller, however, gets out while the gettin is good.

Marshall Kane had cleaned up the town so that women could walk the streets without being accosted.  Hum!  Another plus ca change from todays headlines. There is a scene in which Kane expresses Christ-like doubts; he also considers skipping out. And the strongest character may well be a Hispanic woman, Ramirez, the owner of the saloon and hotel, who seems to run through and chew up the gringo men, starting with the black hat, Frank Miller, then switching colors to the white hat Kane, and even has a fling with the immature Lloyd Bridges. The one aspect of the movie that would have to be left on the PC cutting room floor are the two scenes of the two Indians, one on each side of the saloon room door, with a single feather in each hat.

It was also interesting reading about the political controversy surrounding the film which on the surface seems rather uncontroversial. But 1952 was during the Korean War, the height of the Red Scare and the witch-hunting of the HUAC. The writer for the film, Carl Foreman, would be blacklisted.

A central theme is the fickleness of the towns people who will not support their Marshall, despite everything he has done for the town. It is one man alone, against the forces of evil and therefore a favorite of politicians, as well as others engaged in Sisyphean tasks. May the white hat win in the end. Overall, 4-stars.",1509494400,,3356,4.638047138047138

Something else unique about this film is that it all takes place in real time, from the moment the movie begins Gary Cooper has about an hour and a half before he may die.",1508025600,,341,4.074626865671642

None better than Gary Cooper in roles like this and Sergeant York. Don't get so caught up in the movie that you miss the camera angles that enhance the drama of what is building.",1507680000,,291,4.3090909090909095
3160273,4,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is a classic western movie coming out in the golden age of Hollywood.  I recently viewed it on Hulu Classics and thought it was good.  It is a pretty basic story of a small town marshal Will Kane on his last day on the job, who gets married and then finds out a man he put behind bars is once again free looking for revenge and coming in on the noon train that day.  The characters are all pretty interesting and you can see a lot of different points of view from all the towns people.  Gary Cooper and the whole cast do an excellent job.

With the way the word spread around this tiny western town of the outlaws return in less than an hours worth of time you would think everyone had society media like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram back then.

The film is good and I liked the feeling of impending dread and fear the townspeople display.  The clocks are in nearly every scene in the film as it gets closer to 12 Oclock.  The marshal repeatedly fails to get together a pose to take on the outlaws.  Eventually abandoned by everyone he takes on 4 outlaws by himself.

Now each minute in the film feels like 20 minutes gone by, it is hard to believe the Marshal would have time to get into a fistfight and get fixed up by the local barber, let alone make it to a tavern, a church and several house calls all in the short amount of time before the train arrives.  The marshal had maybe an hour tops once he found out the news.

I liked how his wife shot one of the bandits and didn't act like a helpless damsel in distress and actually took matters in her own hands.  I would have liked it even more if she would have shot at Frank Miller as he attempted to abduct her leading to the finale.

I recognized Lee Van Cleef right away at the beginning and I thought he was the main villain and the train would be coming with more goons or bandits.  Another thing that I thought about was how much one of the outlaws was drinking before the shootout,  I would of thought the film would have made a point of showing him stumble or bumble his weapon because of all the liquor he drank up til that point but nothing really becomes of it.

If anything the only thing I found a bit lacking was the final confrontation with the lead villain Frank Miller.  The film seemed to end very abruptly without the Marshal shaming the townsfolk for their cowardice or at least have Will Kane slowly look around at all the people and let them know they were wrong to abandon him during his time of need.  That is the only reason why I would not give this 5 stars.

Overall I think this is a 4 star film. The plot is good with an interesting cast of characters. The running out of time aspect is well done and you can feel the tension in the air, but ultimately the shootout was not as good as the buildup.",1507593600,,2793,4.175373134328358

I attended a 100 participant meeting of a psychoanalytic society comprised of some of the best psychiatrists in the city focused on a viewing and discussion of this movie.  It is that good, and that thought provoking.  On a more entertainment level it is quite exciting and well acted, but corny in a few spots by the standards of today's movies. Very suspenseful.

3160295,5,B0016MLIKM,"As of August 17, 2017, the vast majority of the one and two star reviews are complaints about dvd's, blu-rays and streaming.  One or two quibble over the realism of the movie, i.e. Westerners were armed and history proves that they would use the arms.  I don't watch Hollywood's products for realism or lessons in tactics and gunfighting.  If it is going to seriously annoy you that the fight could have been over as quickly as the O.K. Corral shootout if Kane had used a shotgun or if he had persuaded one man to hide in the Church tower with a rifle, then don't watch it.  For the rest of us, it's fine acting, a good story with suspense, romance and action and a great theme song if you don't think too much about the lyrics.  This movie is on every top 100 Westerns list I've ever heard of.  It is also on many top ten lists.  More, it is on many lists which are not western specific.

3160303,5,B0016MLIKM,"I saw this classic 1952 western, ""High Noon"" many years ago as a child or adolescent but had little recollection of it. The past few years I have become interested in American westerns and have read some of the literary examples of the genre, including works by A.B Guthrie and ""Butcher's Crossing"" by John Williams. I have also revisited some classic western films, such as ""Shane"". My book group recently discussed Williams' ""Butcher's Crossing"", and thus I was primed for more westerns. The timing was good, and I saw ""High Noon"" on screen at the beautiful AFI Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland. The AFI presented ""High Noon"" in celebration of the film's 65th anniversary and as part of a promotion of a new book, ""High Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic"" The author, Glenn Frankel, attended one of the earlier showings and signed copies of his book.

Westerns were everywhere in the 1950s and early 1960s. I became interested again to see the qualities the genre possessed beyond formulaic stereotyping. I also thought this once highly popular genre might still have something to teach about how Americans understood and could still understand themselves and their country.

The best works in the genre take formulaic elements and turn them into something original and creative. The books and films mentioned in the first paragraph of this review do so, and ""High Noon"" does as well. The film tells the story of Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper) who has served a small town. Hadleyville, in the Territory of New Mexico and cleared out its outlaws. Kane has just married Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and is about to retire. He learns that a killer he was responsible for putting in jail years earlier had just been released and was returning to town with three other thugs. Kane determines to stand the killer and the gang down. Most of the film, shot in real time, shows how the townspeople were afraid and unwilling to help and how Kane's determination to fight the gang threatened his marriage just as it began.

On its release, ""High Noon"" was widely taken as a parable which critiqued Hollywood blacklisting, and, from the title, this theme is developed in Frankel's book. The film was properly seen that way both by its supporters and its critics in the 1950s. But if the film were only a topical critique of blacklisting, it probably would not have survived much less become a classic example of its genre. As with much art, the film has a breadth of meaning beyond political events,

Creative work often is ambiguous and will bear many meanings or interpretations. And so it is with ""High Noon"". I saw the film as a western and as a story of the qualities which made for settlement of the American West. These qualities included a devotion to law and to community. Even if the community displayed cowardice and timidity at a crucial moment, the community was still the source which gave meaning to the determined and purposeful acts of an individual, such as Marshall Kane. The film also emphasizes the importance of having a view of what is right and being willing to act upon it, toughness, and a certain stubbornness. In the film, Marshall Kane had these qualities while most of the town residents were timid and preferred not to get involved. The film celebrates Marshall Kane's loyalty, devotion to duty and willing to take a large chance. In the process, it also shows the community which was able to grow and thrive, after its cravenness, due to an act of courage. The film's exploration of character and community transcends Hollywood blacklisting.

There is a great deal to be learned about American creativity, American character, and the way Americans see themselves from American westerns and other parts of our popular culture. I was grateful for the opportunity to see this film in period theater, to enjoy it, and to think about its significance.

The music, the cinematography, the acting, and even the crystal clarity of the dialog are all excellent.  The plot is engrossing: retired Marshall Will Kane decides to return to town to face four outlaws bent on murdering him.  But what is his motive: duty to protect the town's citizens? to be brave rather than cowardly? self-defense (since he specifically says he could not outrun them)?  He says he doesn't know his own motive, which is perplexing to the audience.  The main plot is bolstered by interesting sub-plots and unexpected events that make the movie more interesting.  However, several men in the church vow to assist Kane, but for no apparent reason (except as a plot device to leave Kane alone to become a hero) they forsake him.  Also, the fistfight in the barn makes no sense.  Finally, the large number of times the outlaws' bullets barely miss Kane in the gunfight seems highly improbable.",1496448000,,1004,4.763005780346821

3160322,5,B0016MLIKM,"This 1952 Classic set the bar for what was yet to come -
'Marshall Will Kane' (Gary Cooper)  had cleaned up 'Hadleyville' (a small town in New Mexico territory) down the years making it
a safe place to live, he is now set to retire and start a new life in another town with his new-bride 'Amy' (Grace Kelly) as the
ceremony and celebration conclude three riders come into town 'Ben Miller' (Sheb Wooley) , 'Jack Colby' (Lee Van Cleef) and
'Jim Pierce' (Robert J Wilke) they are there to meet the noon train on which is 'Frank Miller' (Ian MacDonald)
'Will' had arrested 'Frank' some five years or so back, the vicious killer had been sentenced for a life-term in jail but had been
released early and is returning to 'Hadleyville' with revenge in mind.
When this news reaches the wedding party, 'Will' and 'Amy's' friends urge them to leave town immediately to start their new-life
together before the train arrives in little over an hours time.
The three that wait for 'Frank Miller' are members of his old gang.
'Will' and 'Amy' set off, however a short way into the journey 'Will' pulls up the carriage, he just can't leave the town open to the
will of 'Frank Miller' and his side-kicks, the new Marshall doesn't arrive until tomorrow.
Back in town 'Will' is confident that he'll be able to raise a posse, he has many friends in town many of whom had stood with him
during troubled times in years gone by.
However, even his deputy 'Harvey Pell' (Lloyd Bridges) throws in his badge upset that he'd not been appointed 'Will's' replacement,
and his so-called friends refuse to join in the fight.
'Will's' new bride not wanting to see her husband killed decides she'll leave town on the noon train 'Frank' is arriving on, the judge
that convicted the killer is also set to leave town.
'Will' must question why he has returned, is it to protect those that refuse to help, is it because if the fight isn't finished now, 'Frank'
will only hunt him down, or is it pride ?
Because the three gunmen are at the station waiting, 'Amy' goes back into town to await the train joining 'Frank's' former lover
'Helen Ramirez' ( Katy Jurado) who also intends leaving on the train..
'Will' waits alone for the noon train and the inevitable show-down.
This a tension-filled affair as the hour leading up to noon ticks slowly by
A rousing conclusion to the film as 'Will' faces the four gunmen.
Many of the stars included in the film are seen in many of the memorable westerns that follow this classic.

The movie has some great moments and actors. Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly are the main squeeze here, but if you are a fan of westerns in general, you will see some familiar faces all around in the crowd of citizens.
Well done DVD of an Western Classic everyone should see and get!
The ending is pretty good and screen icon Grace Kelly only adds to the Western atmosphere of beauty.

The bonus features are incredibly immersive and in-depth. I especially loved the essay narrated by the late Anton Yelchin.

If you love High Noon, Westerns, or just movies in general, this release is for you. And who knows, if Olive's Signature series continues after this strong start, they just might give Criterion a run for their premium-label money",1475452800,,585,4.898989898989899
3160409,5,B0016MLIKM,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ive talked before about the resurgence in classic movies making their way to blu-ray format. Its a treat for movie fans and students of film to finally see these films in the most pristine condition possible. One company thats been releasing films this way, everything from schlock drive-in films to full blown top notch older blockbusters, is Olive Films. Most of their releases have been simple, the title alone with few to no extras. Now theyve decided to add their name to the list of companies that handle the classics they have the right to in full blown fashion with their Signature Series. These movies offer the cleanest prints possible as well as some extras thrown in. Its a pure pleasure to see these this way and Olive has kicked it off with one of the all-time classics, HIGH NOON.
If youve never seen the film the plot on the surface is fairly simple. The sheriff of a small western town, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is taking off his badge and getting married to Amy (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who doesnt believe in violence or his carrying a gun. But immediately after their marriage and before they can leave word reaches Kane that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) has been pardoned from prison and Millers gang is waiting at the train station for his arrival on the noon train to arrive. Kane straps his guns on again against the protests of Amy who says she will leave him if he does. What follows is Kanes attempt to get the town people to rally behind him to take on the gang. But no one does, leaving him to stand alone against the four men.
So thats a long paragraph but sums up the surface story being told here. What it doesnt tell is the story that lies underneath it all and one that Hollywood reacted to. The reality is that beneath that surface was the story of screenwriter Carl Foreman who wrote the screenplay and the problems he faced with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). While most think of Sen. Eugene McCarthy and the word McCarthyism with these activities he actually came into the situation later and investigated politicians as opposed to Hollywood.
HUAC was investigating the influence of Communism in the world of entertainment and looking to find out just who was a Communist. They put aside the fact that many were registered as such during WWII when Russia was our ally. Instead rather than seek out any true saboteurs of traitors they labeled anyone connected to the Communist Party as such. Foreman had registered as a Communist years before and only remained involved with them for a year before leaving. But he didn't like the tactics used by HUAC to ferret out people they felt were traitors.
HUAC offered two alternatives. You either provided them with names of anyone else you associated with the Party or you were basically run out of the business or worse imprisoned. Foreman stood up to these methods by admitting his being a member for a single year but refusing to name names. He ended up leaving the country for England.
Now the story of HIGH NOON might seem about a sheriff against an outlaw. But in truth the parable is telling the story of a man standing up for what is right and finding that no one will stand with him. The worst examples of western folk hate him for sending Miller to prison and taming their town, the result of which was their inability to do what they pleased. But then the upstanding members of the community don't back him either. They claim he was paid to handle things, that they will find themselves looking bad before politicians or that this isn't their fight. In the end he finds himself alone taking on the problems the world has placed in front of him, the same situation Foreman found himself in with his fellow writers, producers and studio members. No one stood with him. That is the real story behind HIGH NOON.
Olive has done a spectacular job with this release. Ive never seen the print of this film look so vibrant, something that many won't understand since the film is in black and white. But never fear black and white films. It is the story that matters not the flash of color. And if you are one of the few whove started down the 4k trail it is indeed a 4k master.
Theyve also put together an impressive collection of short featurettes that add to the enjoyment of the film and its background. Included are: A Ticking Clock - Academy Award nominee Mark Goldblatt on the editing of High Noon; A Stanley Kramer Production - Michael Schlesinger on the eminent producer of High Noon; Imitation of Life: The Blacklist History of High Noon - with historian Larry Ceplair and blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein; Ulcers and Oscars: The Production History of High Noon - a visual essay with rarely seen archival elements, narrated by Anton Yelchin; Uncitizened Kane - an original essay by Sight and Sound editor Nick James; and finally the theatrical trailer. None of these is overlong and actually add to the enjoyment of the movie you can discover after your first viewing.
With the quality on hand with this release it makes me look forward to future Olive Films Signature Series releases. My guess is that all other film fans will feel the same way. And at a list price on amazon of $16.99 it makes it a value not to be beaten.",1475107200,,5297,4.617179215270413

3160412,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon stars Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane, who marries Quaker girl Amy (Grace Kelly) and prepares to leave town a day before the replacement marshal is scheduled to arrive. But Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), along with his band of men, is arriving on the noon train, seeking revenge against Kane, who realizes that he must finish this battle. He spends a large part of the film trying to enlist help. Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges) refuses to join Kane because hes now dating the marshals former lover, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado), and believes she still has feelings for him. Other townspeople turn their backs, leaving him to face imminent danger alone. As the clock ticks closer to noon, Kane does his best to prepare for the inevitable showdown.

High Noon is regarded as one of the best Westerns in movie history. Though the story is fairly straightforward and draws upon common themes of the genre, the film is elevated by excellent performances, not only of Cooper, but supporting actors Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan, Jack Elam, and especially Lon Chaney, Jr. as Kanes wise mentor, who delivers some of the movies best dialogue. Cooper himself, known for being the strong silent type, is true to form here, though his performance makes clear that Kane knows full well that the confrontation with Miller and his men may be his swan song. Grace Kelly doesnt have a large role, but does an effective job as a woman sworn to non-violence who finds herself in the midst of the climactic gunfight.

The black and white cinematography by Floyd Crosby is impressive. One shot, in particular, stands out. After Kane has exhausted his entreaties for help, he stands in the street, alone. As he turns to go to the railroad station where Miller waits, the camera pulls back and up, emphasizing both Kanes lack of back-up and his vulnerability.

Bonus extras on the unrated Blu-ray release include the featurettes A Ticking Clock, a discussion of the films editing; A Stanley Kramer Production (background on the producer); Imitation of Life: The Hollywood Blacklist and High Noon, featuring blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein; Oscars and Ulcers: The Production History of High Noon; and Uncitizened Kane, an original essay.

3160415,5,B0016MLIKM,"Sixty-four years on, ""High Noon"" has aged well.  Its depiction of the Old West, all dusty streets, dull grey skies, and otherwise complete lack of monumental vistas is surprisingly modern, focusing more on the characters than the setting in its anticipation of many Westerns which followed it, an extreme example being Tarantino's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hateful-Eight/dp/B01A53WR3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hateful Eight</a>, which, although nominally a ""Western,"" takes place almost entirely within a single room.  The only ""action,"" such as it is, is the shootout at the very end; the real action is in the second act as the sheriff attempts to enlist the help of the townspeople in what at bottom is a personal dispute.  Some people are prepared to step forward, but only if everyone else does; when it becomes clear that Frank Miller is only returning to settle his score with the sheriff, Kane's insistence on staying to face him becomes nothing more than an expression of pride and ego, especially since he is, at that point, no longer officially the sheriff.

Unusual for many films, the story unfolds in real time; the film's actual length of around an hour and a half covers the period from Kane's wedding until the end of the showdown.  ""High Noon"" was also an early example of a film with a unique theme song; sung by Tex Ritter (father of actor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Ritter/dp/B00KN2KY4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Ritter</a>, it's repeated throughout the film, not always appropriately, and to the point of annoyance, like the song in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Cowboy/dp/0792833287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Cowboy</a>&nbsp;- a soundtrack album consisting of a one-sided single.  ""High Noon"" would be two-sided, as there's a rendition of ""Buffalo Gals"" at one point.

""High Noon"" has endured because it presents a complex situation - on one hand, the townspeople are shown to be cowardly ingrates, who refuse to help the sheriff who is described as the man who made the town safe for women and children, but on the other hand, no one should be obligated to risk their life for a completely avoidable personal vendetta.  We are contemptuous and sympathetic at the same time, because we know how each of us would react in a similar situation.",1472947200,,2453,5.794444444444444

3160463,3,B0016MLIKM,"The just-retired sheriff of an Old West town gets married and, upon hearing the news that the criminal who had had control of the town whom he had sent to prison is free and coming back to take revenge on him, quickly flees with his bride...and several miles out, decides to turn back, as the new sheriff has been delayed in arriving. But upon his return, he finds a gang of the criminals' cronies waiting for their old boss to arrive and all the townspeople completely unwilling to help him; some out of preference for the days when the criminal ran the town, but most out of sheer cowardice, and even the sheriff's pleading with all the townspeople to help him deal with the criminal fails to move them. But in the end the sheriff decides he will face them even if it means his death. Even his wife, who had become a Quaker in reaction to several violent deaths of her family members, is ready to desert him. (Uh, she just married an ex-sheriff, whose job included carrying a gun and using it on occasion?)

The movie is said to be a thinly-disguised attack on the House Unamerican Activities Committee, which was then investigating Communist influence on the Hollywood movie industry. The analogy is simple: the criminal gang represents the HUAC, the townspeople represent people in Hollywood who are too afraid of the HUAC to stand up to them, and the ex-sheriff is the hero who will face the HUAC himself, with or without help. The cowardice of the townspeople is all too contrived; the gang the ex-sheriff faces is small, unimpressive, and easily defeated. The comparison of the HUAC to criminal thugs also falls apart; the HUAC had genuine popular support and had noble intentions, whether wrongheaded or not. Communist infiltration into the Hollywood movie industry really existed; the extent may have been overestimated but it was genuine.",1464566400,,1848,4.775

You must see it at least twice, as the second viewing gets you deeper into the story and the fright and evil of the characters who abandon the sheriff.

3160631,4,B0016MLIKM,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this western...

High Noon (1952) is considered not only one of the greatest westerns of all time, but one of the greatest movies of all time, no matter what the genre.  The movie is well shot, well edited, and the picture quality is excellent.  Most of the acting is good, however...

I feel this movie is somewhat overrated, though it does have a lot of strong points.  It doesn't grab me as much as so many other westerns do.  It isn't the black-and-white photography, as I love black-and-white movies, no matter what the genre.  I think the lack of scenery, the lack of action, and the excessive dialogue throughout make the movie a little less appealing to me compared to other westerns.  The strong points of this movie are the editing, the pretty good acting, the all star cast, and the crisp black-and-white photography.  The best part of this movie is Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado, both of whom give good performances, especially Jurado.  This movie also stars Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney, Henry Morgan, and Lee Van Cleef.  This movie attempts to make somewhat of a political statement much like Johnny Guitar (1954) does, but the difference is that Johnny Guitar is a 5-star movie.  Don't get me wrong, I think High Noon is a very good movie, just not quite worthy of a 5 star rating when compared to other westerns that ARE worthy of a 5 star rating.

If you're into westerns that have a lot of action and more of a true western feel and attitude, I suggest sticking with the Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, John Wayne, and Jimmy Stewart westerns.  Also see Shane (1953).

Personal favorite: Clint Eastwood's

The acting is great.  Gary Cooper is the lead.  He plays an upright town marshall that the town abandons.  He is married that day to a lady played by Grace Kelly.  This is Grace Kelly's second movie appearance.

The movie is based on a short story named ""The Tin Star"".  The short story I am speaking of was composed by John Cunningham.  I found it in a fine compilation A Century of Western Short Stories edited by a gentleman name John Jakes.  I have read this short story.  The movie has significant changes and is far superior.

I do not know how many books have been written about High Noon.  I had not read any.  But I am currently reading one of the best biographies that I have ever read. It is about Grace Kelly.  It is named ""Grace, A Biography"".  It is written by Thilo Wydra.  I. This very detailed biography, Mr. Wydra goes into many details about other people and movies, etc...

In this fine work, Mr. Wydra goes into great detail about this movie.  Mr. Wydra states that this movie is a metaphor for the McCarthy political era of the late 1940s and early 1950s.  I had never made that connection.  Mr. Wydra also states that the interactions between Grace Kelly and another female actress, Katy Jurado, is a debate about the roles of women and feminism.  I had never thought of that.

In any event, I recommend this movie standing on its own.  If, by any chance, you are interested in Hollywood history and the place of this movie in that history, you may wish to read Mr. Wydra's analysis.  Thank You.",1452124800,,1787,4.349544072948328

3160771,5,B0016MLIKM,"During the 1940's and early 1950's, the typical film Western was a cookie-cutter escapist story, usually involving a bad guy in a black hat, and a heroic good guy in a white hat. The innocent townspeople suffered at the hands and gun of the outlaw until the heroic lawman confiscated his gun, cuffed his hands, or in some cases shot him dead, not unlike the young knight saving the Princess from the villain in a Chivalric Romance. Instead of swords the characters wield 6-shooters. But High Noon is different. Here good and evil are more blurred, and the issue of indifference in the face of danger becomes the all-encompassing theme. Instead of a chivalric heroism, High Noon is a morality tale which has more in common with Shakespeare and even Greek tragedy than with knighthood romance. The script also served as a metaphor for the Hollywood Red Scare/Blacklisting which was a result of McCarthyism during that time. ""High Noon"", one of the few films regarded as both a classic and a masterpiece, inspired many later films and television, such as the morally ambiguous Sergio Leone Westerns of the 1960's, which would also star Lee van Cleef, who finally gets to talk! It would also inspire the television series ""24"" which is also based on the idea of ""real time"".

Despite popular misconception, the term ""High Noon"" meaning either the pinnacle/peak or the climax of a confrontation existed long before this film. The term itself dates from the late Middle Ages, and quotes from American Civil War primary sources (circa 1860's) use the phrase in the same way that it is treated in this film. The first audiences would have understood what the term meant in this context. The innovative concept which permeates the cinematic experience is having the events unfold in ""real time"" up until Noon. The first 90 minutes, from 10:30am to 12:00pm, are more or less 90 minutes of activity, and the audience is continually aware of the time with shots of different clocks and timepieces through this period which takes up about 75% of the movie.

The plot is deceptively simple which paves the way for much more complex thematic and even psychological underpinnings. Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper in an Oscar-winning tour-de-force performance, learns on his wedding day about the return of a bona fide killer, Frank Miller, recently released from prison. Kane had apparently incarcerated him, and Frank Miller is now on a train scheduled to arrive in town where his three associates are waiting for him at the depot. (One of his associates, who remains silent the entire time except for a harmonica, is played by a very young Lee van Cleef!) Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day. Kane resolves he must stay in the town and confront Miller, despite the protests of the townspeople. He solicits volunteer deputies for the task but the townspeople appear indifferent to the plight.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is the ambiguity. Although most of the town agrees that Frank Miller is a killer and outlaw, a few thrived under the anarchy of Miller, such as the owner of the local hotel who complains his business suffered when Kane moved in and stopped Miller. Which points to another interesting innovation: the film gradually reveals back-story but only as much as the characters decide to disclose. Only by the time Noon arrives has the audience put together the pieces of the larger puzzle. Even when we the audience first learn of the coming confrontation, there is much which remains concealed.

The main reasons the film works as well it does is because of the outstanding script, the believability of all the actors, and the compelling camera work which paints a very different image on its cinematic canvas. The scenes are shot rather starkly in front of a seeming cloudless sky. Periodically, we see the railroad tracks going off into the distance, knowing only that it is from these tracks something menacing will arrive. Cooper is absolutely outstanding, his performance so subtle and underplayed it appears effortless but simultaneously absolutely believable. The dialog is for the most part right on the money, never lapsing into clich&eacute;. Characters talk very little about the dilemma and are often reluctant to tell what they know. The Mexican woman who had been involved with both Miller and later Kane as part of the back-story is asked about what she knows from Kane's bride but refuses.

High Noon is a suspense film rather than a straightforward Western, which was one of its criticism early on but has over time become its strength. The subject could have been easily a film noir set in the 1940's with a killer arriving on a train into a city. But I think the starkness of a Midwestern American town circa 1870 gives the whole story a feeling of unease. Because the story relies more on drama and anticipation than pure action, High Noon rises above the fray and into the realm of drama which explores the tragic human condition. In this case, the tragedy is not one of unjustified death but the inability of humans to act courageously in the face of evil.",1433808000,,5220,4.860674157303371

3160775,5,B0016MLIKM,"This picture is a beautiful transfer on Blu-ray.
Though it is not my favourite Western - 'Shane' takes that mantle - High Noon still is a superior film, and it almost makes me say that Gary Cooper is the best film actor of all time because of it. (He is, and HN ranks no. 4 on my best Westerns in spite of him)

The photography is notable : so many close-ups of speaking actors whilst the background is notably misty ; not out of focus, but misty and almost cloudy. So the clocks and their timing (which is so apparent that many critics had nothing else more to say on this picture because perhaps they were dumb and bored and were looking at their watches) made the viewer a part of the action and the image and its background unresolvableness a split in perspective ; are we meant to feel that the townsfolk who were non-participants in the Marshall's concern oblivious to common time, as may we the viewer (being of course privy to both sides of a story) be so aware that there is so much to do in what little time we have ?

The Director, Fred Zinnemann, got a lot of flak here because his hero was a coward, and professional critics accused him of belittling the Western Tradition because a man of the west who won in the end did so out of fear and had his wife kill, unbeknown to himself, with a bullet in the back.
Westerns are no longer viable, I think, because the gladiator story has had its day ; Fred Zinnemann had made a Western which gave a fine Star full rein to his talent.
The Western, surely, could do with another fine morality tale such as this in which the winner might not be the protagonist, but a neutral suspect.",1431216000,,1637,4.27741935483871

3160918,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon, 1952 film

The film begins with a man sitting and waiting. Another comes to join him. Then a third man, and they ride into town. People notice them. Pierce, Miller, and Colby ask about the train schedule. Will Kane and Amy Fowler wed. Kane is the Town Marshal, but intends to quit. A telegram brings news of Frank Miller's pardon! [Some kind of payoff in those days?] Kane is advised to leave town. [Can every problem be avoided as a solution?] No, Kane decides to return; he doesn't even have a gun! [Unbelievable.] Kane could never be safe as long as those four were after him. ""I'm not trying to be a hero."" With special deputies he will outnumber them. Amy asks him to choose between her whims and his experience and judgment. The judge decides to skip town. Deputy Harvey goes to see Marshal Kane, he wants the job and a recommendation.

We learn about the past relationships of Harvey, Kane, and Frank Miller! Mrs. Ramirez wants to sell her store quickly so she can leave on the noon train. Will the hotel be more prosperous when Frank Miller is back? Harvey is in the saloon. Ben Miller drops in for a bottle. Kane asks for help in the saloon, none volunteer. [Why?] Neither does a friend. Jimmy asks to join, he used to be good with a gun. Kane goes to the church to ask for all the special deputies he can get to help him. The church members argue over what must be done. Time is running short. Can a problem be solved by ""deferred maintenance""? ""They just don't care."" [Why?] Mark says he is too old. Mrs. Kane visits Mrs. Ramirez for help, but she is leaving too. Amy's personal experiences are explained. [A clue to the future?] ""A smart man knows when to back away."" Harvey talks to Kane. [Does this fight make sense? Note the bruises.] One man had volunteered, but Herb doesn't like the odds. The clock strikes noon. The steam train whistles its approach. Kane writes a holographic Last Will and Testament.

Marshal Kane walks into Main Street and watches the wagon leave for the train station. Frank Miller detrains and joins those three men. Breaking glass warns Kane. Shots are fired, not it is three against one. The hunting goes on, one man runs into the barn. Now it is two against one. The stable is set afire. Kane frees the horses and escapes. One man is shot from behind! [I won't tell who did it.] Only Frank Miller is left. Then Kane appears in the street. It is over at last. Will and Amy are reunited. Will tosses his tin star into the dust.

""The Making of High Noon"" follows. Monochrome is used to reduce costs, as in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", when an unconventional movie is produced. This story is based on ""The Tin Star"", a 1947 story in Collier's Magazine. Carl Foreman was an ""unfriendly witness"" before HUAC, a man who stood for what he believed in. The script was an excellent drama. The low budget excluded the usual padding. Western movies show the pioneers who overcame adversity; this provides hope for the common people.

The story takes place in virtually real time. This is a morality play where a good man triumphs over villains. It doesn't give the background from five years ago when Frank Miller was convicted of manslaughter. Was he involved in the running of that ""hotel"" and a gambling casino? Did Will Kane move in to take over? In the 19th century the local Committee of Vigilance would have eliminated robbers and murderers. A Town Marshal was elected by the voters, but the local power elite would have selected a man to do their bidding. A Marshal who best represented the people would have no problem in getting special deputies. This story goes against these historical facts. Having a woman with a firearm is also unconventional, but few dared to comment on this. This one-man army is similar to the later ""Rambo"" movies.",1412640000,,3787,4.571428571428571

3160943,5,B0016MLIKM,"If you are looking for an action-packed western - this is not it.  It is, instead, a fascinating study of human nature, of group behavior - one is more likely to stand up to danger if others do, but less likely if others remain seated.  Many reviews of this movie may leave you with the impression that no one is willing to help the marshal meet the vengeful band of gunslingers, but there are a few - unfortunately for the marshal, none of them are suitable.

You may also have the impression that Marshal Kane is fearless - not so.  Kane passes through two moments of weakness.  The first occurs when he learns, after turning in his badge after the wedding, that a dangerous criminal, who swore to get him, is arriving on the noon train.  At the urging of the wedding party, he and his new wife flee town in their buckboard, but Kane can't escape his sense of duty and returns to town.  His second moment of weakness comes later in the film.  How does Kane feel about this?  At one point, he tells his new wife, ""If you think I like this - you're crazy!""

Bonuses:  ""Movie Trailer""  &  ""The Making of High Noon""  -  This outstanding, insightful 20 minute film is hosted by Leonard Maltin.  There are many interviews, including Gary Cooper, Lloyd Bridges, and actor John Ritter, the son of Tex Ritter who sings the movie's haunting theme song.

It is always a praise of a classic movie when a re-make is made. The story gets some changes,the scenery is different,the music is different,,and of course the actors are different;and that's as it should be. I ,for one, really like the classic version,but I thouroughrly enjoyed this well made version. This movie reminds be of other classsics such as ""Tombstone"" or ""The Untouchables"" and even though they are different;they are still enjoyable.
 I really enjoy the additions that get added to VHS that cover Scenes,Location,,Production and Interviews with the Producer,Director and Actors.;and in this case ,they are an excellent explanation and addition to the movie.

Mr Robert A. Harris - noted film archivist and restoration expert - panned this particular disc. In deference to his expertise, I didn't buy this at first, hoping for a better release to surface. Later, I read several reviews on Blu-ray.com and on Amazon - mostly praising this Olive presentation. I took the plunge.

I don't know what all the fuss was about. This is a satisfying presentation with a clear, sharp, filmic look and solid sound.

3160962,5,B0016MLIKM,"Olive Film's 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition of High Noon (1952) presents this critically lauded, still controversial western masterpiece in a Hi-Def transfer that renders all other home video versions obsolete.

The Stanley Kramer production, tightly directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman, earned the hatred of 1950s McCarthyists, including John Wayne and Howard Hawks, who were so outraged they made Rio Bravo (1959) as a right-wing response. Wayne went further than that, teaming up with Hollywood Gossip mogul Hedda Hopper and the House Un-American Activities Committee to run Foreman out of the country. Foreman moved to England and never returned. Wayne forever boasted of forcing the writer into exile. Kramer, responding to accusations that High Noon was anti-American, tried to get Foreman's name taken off the credits. Gary Cooper intervened on Foreman's behalf, making Kramer's effort unsuccessful, but Kramer had better luck forcing Foreman to sell his part of their company. So much for loyalty under pressure: ironic, given the film's theme of civic morality.

The biggest offense of the film, for Wayne and his fellow extremist kooks, was the final shot of Will Kane supposedly dropping his marshal's badge in the dust and stomping on it. Wayne saw symbolism aplenty, but his faulty vision was filtered through a lens of Cold War paranoia and exaggeration.[1] Will Kane merely dropped the badge. He never stepped on it. The other offense was the portrayal of the townspeople as a greedy, self-cannibalizing lot, a hypocritical church community who argue their way out of communal (and personal) loyalty. Wayne and Hawks' Rio Bravo depicted, in sharp contrast, a town full of old-fashioned buddy-buddy camaraderie. If Wayne and Hawks were alive today they might have rethought their depiction, because High Noon could served as an apt snapshot of contemporary division. It's a good thing that actor/director team didn't live to see the 21st century, though, because despite the intent behind Rio Bravo, and despite its occasional tendency towards sentimental phoniness, it remains, along with High Noon, one of the standout westerns in the genre's greatest decade.[2]

One cannot approach High Noon without addressing its political themes, both within the film's text and those raised in its aftermath. Along with writer Formean, co-star Lloyd Bridges and cinematographer Floyd Crosby were also awarded with temporary blacklists until the FBI cleared them of Communist affiliations. The fifty-one year old Gary Cooper was engaged in an affair with his twenty-three year old co-star Grace Kelly (putting an end to Coop's affair with Patricia Neal.) Kelly's fling with the long established Republican protected her from McCarthyism's scrutiny. Cooper was friendly with the HUAC, and testified before them (without ever naming names), but he only did what was expected of him, then returned to his top priority of resuming his romance with a future princess.

Cooper was in Europe by the time the Academy Awards Ceremony rolled around and asked Wayne to accept the award of Best Actor on his behalf, should he happen to win. Of course, he did, and the Duke did a prompt, public about-face in his acceptance speech: ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of. Coop and I have been friends hunting and fishing for more years than I like to remember. He's one of the nicest fellows I know. And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off horses in pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport about all this sportsmanship, I'm going back and find my business manager, agent, producer, and three-name writers and find out why I didn't get High Noon instead of Cooper.""[3]

The speech renders Wayne a hypocrite, since seeing potential red from the outset, it was he who first refused the role of Marshal Will Kane, thus paving the path for Gary Cooper in the part.[4] Yet, despite Wayne's standing as a precursor of Rush Limbaugh's pharisaical aggression, he can, perhaps, best be summed up in an assessment I was privy to in a screening of Red River (1948). The host, an erudite writer, had this to say about Wayne: ""I met the Duke's son Patrick. Unlike his dad, Patrick is a thorough gentleman; pleasant and courteous. Unfortunately, he also differs from his dad when it comes to acting because Patrick's a lousy actor. His dad was a great actor and that's not really up for argument.""

However, as skilled an actor as he was, Wayne as Will Kane would have been a loose right-wing cannon. Gary Cooper's brand of authentic conservatism merged seamlessly with his marshal. Cooper's laconic, weathered portrayal of internalized integrity shines through Zinnemann's opulent artistry.[5]

Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower were among the film's fans. Reagan saw positive American values in the theme of an individual placing the safety of his peers above his own personal interests. When I first saw the film in my youth, prior to readings of political allegories, my interpretation of the film paralleled Reagan's.

If Wayne has come to embody our idea of the snarling, mythological Westerner, Gary Cooper is our moderate, amorous Rino cowpoke. We readily accept his pairing with Grace Kelly's Quaker Amy Fowler (the ""darling Clementine"" of the film's theme song). Amy is a model of another form of extremism.  Amy's tragic past has rendered her a pacifist with a checklist, adhering to each dogmatic bullet point. Will cannot violate his conscience to succumb to any extreme ideology. We genuinely root for their reconciliation. Oddly, it is in its climax that we find High Noon is, in fact, a paradigm for conservative mythology. Once faced with physical threat, Amy's militant pacifism is, in fact, submitted as a futile, theoretical interpretation of Christian tenets. The townspeople, led by Mitchell, have their own ideological creeds, dictated primarily by the potential capital gains Frank Miller and his gang bring by their return to Hadleyville.

Katy Jurado's Helen Ramirez is the literary female counterpart to Kelly's pure Virgin Mary. Helen, the tainted Magdalene, is, of course, a necessary contrast, and she steals every scene she is in, despite Zinnemann's efforts to highlight Kelly. Not unexpectedly, there was rivalry between the two actresses on set. Lon Chaney, Jr. shines in his role as the arthritic former lawman and Kane mentor, Martin Howe. Chaney acts with such effective pathos that one wished producers had realized his greater potential as a character actor, rather than as a B grade horror star. Lloyd Bridges' portrayal of self-serving deputy Harvey Pell is less effective, occasionally stiff in line readings, and a noticeable case of miscasting. Lee van Cleef,  debuting here, was originally cast in the role of Pell, but he would not surgically alter his nose, which producers thought ""too villainous looking.""  Instead, Cleef was relegated to playing one of the thugs, setting him on the path to a wonderfully typecast career.

Editor Elmo Williams' work here is exemplary and, with much ballyhoo, he cut the film to play out in real time. Dmitri Tiomkin's score is perfectly synchronized, and Tex Ritter's theme song, which sold over a million copies, is so iconic that every singer tackling it since then has rendered a pale imitation.

Zinnemann and Crosby intentionally shot High Noon in stark black and white. Zinnemann valiantly fought to keep media mogul Ted Turner's filthy colorizing hands off the film. Alas, Zinnemann lost and Turner, with Republic Pictures, produced an asinine colorized version for television. Therein lies the difference between celluloid and the corporal world. In the latter, sometimes the bad guys win.

*Due to John Wayne's interpretation of this scene, he and fellow right wing extremist Ward Bond bullied Gary Cooper into backing out of a planned independent production company with Forman and producer Robert Lippert. []

*The American Film Institute lists High Noon second in its list of top ten westerns. First is John Ford's The Searchers (1956) with Wayne. Two other films starring Wayne made the list: Red River at number five and Ford's Stagecoach (1939) at number nine. []

*The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was as hypocritical as Wayne, awarding the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B. DeMille's dreadful The Greatest Show On Earth (1952), in order to appease Joseph McCarthy and the right-wing campaign launched against High Noon. This snub is, justifiably, seen as one of the many examples of the Academy's irrelevancy. []

*Gregory Peck was next offered the role after Wayne refused it. Peck also declined the part, feeling it too closely resembled The Gunfighter (1950), which he had just made. Peck later counted the decision as his biggest career mistake. However, Peck, ever the gentleman, admitted he could not have played the part as well as Cooper. Charlton Heston, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and Kirk Douglas were also offered the role and declined it. []

*Zinnemann and makeup artist Gustaf Norin gave Cooper no makeup in order accentuate the actor's inherent sense of anguish. []

3160963,4,B0016MLIKM,"Made on a low budget on a standard set, Fred Zinnemann (director), Carl Foreman (writer), Elmo Williams and Harry Gerstad (editors) nonetheless thoughtfully ask questions related to human nature in difficult situations as they carefully build tension in this 85-minute 1952 western.  The film broke the mold of superficial all-action westerns that preceded it, having more in common with the taut, realistic and dialogue-driven dramas that were one of the highest forms of achievement from late 40s and early 50s Hollywood (unless they swerved too heavily into melodrama).  The major weakness in this film is the relationship between sheriff Kane, played to stoic perfection by Gary Cooper, and of Amy Kane, portrayed by the much younger Grace Kelly.  It is not the age difference nor the particularities of the acting that fail, but rather relates to the implausibility of them being together in the first place and the consequent detriment to the logic of the plot and theme as the movie unfolds.

The plot is relatively straightforward, but contains several details that are important to note.  Sheriff Kane learns of the prison release and near-term train arrival of the dastardly Frank Miller, a guy he arrested and judge (and jury, we presume, but where are those members?) Mettrick sent to prison a few years ago.  Frank vowed his revenge, we learn as we look at the chair in which he sat upon conviction, and three toughs with which he ran are now in town waiting for Frank to arrive on the Sunday noon train.  When Frank and the boys reunite, they will return to murder Kane and Mettrick.  Kane, by chance, was going to quit as Sheriff the next day, as it so happens he was married that same day, just prior to learning that Miller and the gang (one of whom is played by the squinty and glinty-eyed Lee Van Cleef, already distinctive).  We learn that he married the young blonde and bonneted Quaker Amy Fowler, who arrived in town from who knows where and apparently knows little of Kane's past - and not just the Miller affair.  Will Kane and his new bride start to leave town, but he is overcome with some sort of moral responsibility that, true to the code of the west, he cannot articulate but we understand - Amy does not - and he returns to the fictional Hadleyville, somewhere in the New Mexico territory, to gather volunteer deputies to face the Miller threat.  Significantly and rather absurdly, the Quaker Amy - did she not realize the kind of man he is, did he not realize her strict code of anti-violence? - decides to leave him on the spot because of this decision, vowing to leave on the train that will have just dropped off his would-be killer.

He does not have long to accomplish this.  The film paces itself in near real-time, as Zinnemann provides consistent and periodic shots of large pendulum clocks that seem to be in every room to increase the tension.  Kane and Amy were married around 10:30, the train arrives at noon. We are also periodically provided with low-angle shots of the train track, the tiny depot in the background, creating a sense of the empty loneliness of the place and the situation, particularly, as it turns out, for Will Kane.  In a series of encounters that do not require description - but are repetitively and annoyingly accompanied by the much praised but relatively hokey film score by Dimitri Tiomkin, Kane travels from saloon to church and to a few residences as well in his effort to round up deputies that will help him, but to no avail. Additionally, the film ultimately brings us scenes of the morally and emotionally strong Mexican businesswoman, Helen Ramirez (played brilliantly by the smoldering Katy Jurado), who had been Kane's lover, and the headstrong Quaker, Amy.  Their dialogue and their difference defines the key moral choice involved in this situation - does killing a killer really solve anything, or does evil need to be confronted, violently if necessary, for civilization to progress? We also learn that Amy's brother and father died violently, and we learn that Helen does not much like Kane anymore, though her defense of him to Amy is vigorous.  What fractured the relationship of Helen and Will, the two strongest characters in this little town?  We are left to only guess.

The encounters with the various people in the town are instructive.  While the good God-fearing people of the church initially support deputization enthusiastically, their natural fear, combined with the notion that this, after all, is not their quarrel, allows them to not only back down from supporting Kane, but with Kane's supposed pal, Mayor Jonas Henderson (a solid Thomas Mitchell) leading the way, suggest that Kane leave town pronto to save himself as well as the residents of Hadleyville.  The mayor apparently believes Frank Miller and the gang, who used to raise hell and own the town back in the day, will search fruitlessly and forever for Kane and never come back to disrupt the town.  Such, accurately portrayed, are the justifications of men under great duress.  The owners of the saloon and the hotel are also interesting, but less convincing.  They are apparently concerned only about commerce, and the subdued nature of the town post Kane's vanquish of the Miller gang has left them with less business volume - though the saloon sure seems pretty busy for a Sunday morning. I guess that old notion of a stable community, allowing for the influx of those middle-class capabilities and yearnings and dollars has somehow not paid off for these businessmen, who would rather have drunken brawlers and shoot-ups drive the local economic engine.  In any event, there is no support for Kane in town, not even from his hot-headed erstwhile deputy Pell, a role unconvincingly written and impatiently portrayed by Lloyd Bridges, whose distrust of Kane is not authentically developed by writer, director or actor.

When the moment of truth arrives, the critical decisive action is that taken by Amy, apparently motivated by love and persuaded by Helen.  It is heavily foreshadowed in the shootout scene, but nonetheless leaves us believing that she does in fact have the American pragmatic moral conviction, most specifically that of the West, her clever-sounding but weak-kneed non-violent idealism left wanting in the face of the hard realities of life.  The film contains thoughtful suggestions of both the ugly blacklist era, of which writer Carl Foreman was a victim, depicted in the isolation experienced by the Kane and those who refused to testify against peers in the rush to judge who was truly American and not, and of the lessons of World War II, in which pacific notions of isolation and a willingness to dance away from the horrors of the early forties were not consonant with what was required to save free societies.  Because of those well-conceived and convincingly-portrayed ideas, High Noon is a commendable film worth viewing more than once.  If only Zinnemann and Foreman would have provided some scenes to explain the manner in which Will and Amy incongruously came together, why Helen and Will broke apart and even the antagonism between Will and deputy Pell - while still providing the foundation for the elucidation of those worthy themes - one might regard it as a master parable for postwar America.  Perhaps they worried that the sense of tension would be lost by including such explanatory scenes, but 15 minutes added to this relatively short film in the context of what the viewer knows is to come at the end might actually have enriched, rather than diminished, the climax.

 The plot involves a longtime marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) of Hadleyville in the New Mexico Territory who has recently retired after his marriage to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) who happens to be a Quaker.  The story goes that as Kane was ready to leave when he was informed on Sunday morning that the train due in at 12:00 noon had old nemeses Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) a criminal whom Kane brought to justice years ago.  In fact Miller was to be hanged for his crimes but due to legal technicalities his sentence was changed and he was subsequently released.

 Kane was told by all his friends and some enemies in fact that he should take his leave with his new bride.  Kane refuses to budge and does not go and he considers this as unfinished and a matter of personal honor that he confront not only Miller but three of his sidekicks who are in fact waiting at the Hadleyville railroad station for the arrival of Miller.

 As the story develops further we see Kane trying to gather deputies to combat these four gunmen and of course he finds that many of his friends are not about to put themselves in harms way.  It is at this time in the movie when the props of the clock ticking and the sounds of a train whistle charging forward to the railroad station take on a haunting meaning.

 The movie is not just a great Western, but tells a greater story about how a man faces a crisis when everyone including his wife abandons him.  As the clocks ticks and the whistle blows to the inevitable showdown there is the greatest scene in film history as the camera fades up and over Kane as he walks to face the four gunmen.  This shot alone stands tall in filmmaking history.

3160983,5,B0016MLIKM,"This traditional western with its iconic title is the best American movie ever made, both cinematically and culturally.

Cinematically, the movie enhances the suspense by using its now famous techniques of the ticking clock and the empty railway station waiting for the main criminal to arrive.  Gary Cooper does a great job in playing the stoical marshal.  The realism is enhanced by accidental events such as when the marshal and the criminals confront each other.  The music adds to the effect by employing a catchy theme song instead of an overbearing orchestra.

But the main effect of the movie is cultural.  The movie evokes a mythical past of the lone American hero confronting evil.  In real life many of the townspeople, if not most, would have supported the marshal.  But the rugged individualism the movie portrays is a part of American culture that is rapidly disappearing.

There is also a romantic subplot where the marshal resists his new bride's nagging to leave town and this may have been the last time any man in America was able to resist any nagging.  The new bride initially leaves but then returns and helps the marshal kill the criminals at the very end.

Today individualism is being replaced by group identity where the favored groups are race (except white), gender (except male), sexual orientation (except heterosexual), religion (except Christianity), and ethnicity (except European).",1384387200,,1415,5.108695652173913

3160990,5,B0016MLIKM,"Viewing the 60th-Anniversary Edition on DVD in clear, crisp B&W on a 50"" plasma TV is a joy.  It also reveals things I never noticed before.
  Historically, May-December marriages were common.  I have no story problem with an older man (Kane) marrying a young woman (Amy) here.
  A poster in Kane's office, near the front door, is an ever-present portent of what's coming:  ""War is Declared--President Calls For 75,000 Volunteers.""
  Kane is ambidextrous!  He uses only one gun, but shoots Colby with his left hand and later Frank Miller with his right.  (No wonder he's the best marshal they ever had.)
  Despite some grumpy viewers' preferences, Kane would NEVER step on that badge after dropping it in the dirt.  He's spent the last hour-and-a-half defending what it stands for!  Kane is a man of integrity.  When Trumbull, in church, asks why he doesn't arrest the other three gunmen now, Kane's reply says it all:  They haven't done anything wrong.  He can't arrest them for sitting at the depot.  Kane upholds the LAW.  Let someone with INTEGRITY pick up that badge.
  Finally, that buckboard question.  If Amy's bags were loaded aboard the train, how can they be present at the end?  Answer: they WEREN'T.  Look again.  When Amy drives past Kane at high noon, with Helen Ramirez beside her, the back is loaded with BOTH women's bags--Helen's on top, Amy's covered by a tarp.  The stationmaster loads HELEN'S bags aboard the train.  But, hearing the opening gunfire, Amy bolts off the train and runs into town to find Kane.  We may rationalize the stationmaster wouldn't load her bags if she's staying behind, so they're still on the buckboard when the train pulls out with Helen aboard.  And that's why they're still present at the end.",1378080000,,1743,4.829931972789115

My experience with the film began as a child while accompanying my parents to a regular Wednesday night film at the theater in the early 50s. Cowboy movies were always my favorites and although ""High Noon"" had a more mature story line then a eight year old could fully understand, I came away realizing I had seen something special. My parents talked in glowing terms about the movie all the way home while I sat listening in the back seat of the car. Over the intervening decades I viewed the film at least a half dozen times and have always enjoyed it. It has a simple straight forward story line and the strength of the film is built with the strong acting ability of the entire cast.

Then wait for the last bad guy to get off the train and then plug him? And all the townspeople, many who were Civil War vets or fought Indians, and Cooper can't find one to help him? A western town in frontier days full of cowards? I know the standard plot device for many westerns was the lone hero against the bad guys showing up the cowardly townspeople. Baloney. The movie is just too dull and unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of old westerns, and I know how unrealistic most of the plot devices are in those movies. Still, I can't watch  High Noon without becoming irritated very quickly by the lack of common sense. Come on Coop, stroll down to the train depot with your Winchester, plug the three baddies sitting in chairs and stewed to the gills. Then wait until Frank Miller gets off the train and plug him.

3161002,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper's finest role is that of Marshal Will Kane in the classic Western High Noon.

This movie is an extremely simple story.  Marshal Kane sent a gang of evil desperados off to hang.  However, their sentences were commented due to a legal technicality.  These men are returning on the Noon Train to seek vengeance against the Marshal & his town.

Thus Marshal Kane must face the situation.  This however is where the suspense starts.  The evil gang is not doing anything illegal-yet, and Kane has also just gotten married and is about to leave town.  His wife is wholly against him getting involved in such an event.  Despite these problems, Kane decides to save his town.

The story plays out in real time and clocks are shown throughout.  Kane struggles to find supporters, in one ironic scene he interrupts a church singing The Battle Hymn of the Republic to find backup.  The church congregation decides to sit out the fight.  This theme plays out, nobody in town wants to take up the fight to resist evil.  This moral equivocating heightens the suspense and creates a movie that is worth remembering.

A great Western Classic.",1374192000,,1137,4.758974358974359
3161003,5,B0016MLIKM,"We are dealing with a town that was run by the Frank Miller gang.  Despite murders and lawlessness, certain unsavory elements preferred Miller to Kane who with the help of several deputies, cleaned up the town.  As Marshal, Kane was disliked by many (some who preferred Miller).  The movie opens with Frank Miller, who had been condemned to death - being pardoned and the four main members of the gang going after Kane.  Afterward, they would presumably run the town.  (SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)  Kane and his newlywed wife are sent out of town to protect them.  Kane speculates that even if they evade Miller, somehow Miller will find him wherever he goes.  He figures that he can get deputies and track down the four.  His wife wonders why he is making it his fight rather than letting others deal with Miller.  The new marshal is due the next day.  Those who want Miller stopped don't want to fight the gang of four.  No one realizes that once you have enough people, there will be no fight.  The deputy is willing to fight if Kane puts in a good word for him.  Kane believes he is too immature.  If had had agreed, there would have been at least three people.  Some of the towns people believe that stopping Miller through a gunfight will make the town less hospitable to investors.  Illogic galore.  Those who won't deal with Miller will be conquered by him.  At the end, it is Kane alone against the others.  Earlier he refused to arrest the three others because that would be unlawful, even though he dooms the town.  What if the others were put in jail and Miller too?  Probably they would talk about their plans and could be put in jail.  In any event we see a whole town where the anti-Miller side is afraid of FOUR men.  Many looked for twelve men to go after Miller's four.  A  town full of cowards and idiots.  Kane's inability to work with people made it impossible for him to win converts.  Matt Dillon, he is not.

3161011,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is an American classic that has stood the test of time. If you can accept or ignore the unlikely premise that the populace of a post-Civil War western town would cower at the approach of four thugs, the film is immensely enjoyable, packed with fine performances, skillful direction and artful photography. The fast-paced action is facilitated by the real-time presentation, wherein the entire storyline takes place in just the 85 minutes depicted on the screen. And then there's the music by Hollywood veteran Dimitri Tiomkin, one of the most spare and iconic movie scores of all time, and one of the most effective. The Academy Award winning score includes the song ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"", with lyrics by Ned Washington. This simple but haunting melody is sung by Tex Ritter, and recurs throughout the film.

The Olive Films 2012 Blu-ray release of the 1952 movie offers a noticeable improvement in both video and audio as compared to the Republic Pictures DVD releases of 2001 and 2002. However, considering its niche-market price and its dearth of special features (just the Leonard Maltin making-of video and a theatrical trailer, and no subtitles) this release is only for those who really love the film, or do not yet have a DVD version. And if you do have the DVD hang on to it, because it has more special features than does the new Blu-ray.

Gary Cooper won his second Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Town Marshal Will Kane, in a performance featuring many close-ups of his craggy and expressive face. The emotional impact of this film is enormous, concentrated by the black-and-white photography, compact running time, unobtrusive musical score, and consistently fine acting. This Blu-ray provides a pristine look at a great film.",1370563200,,1767,4.946127946127946

Now to High noon, High noon is a wonderful western.

The film tells the story of Marshall Will Kane who is willing to face his foes even when no one else will help him. Gary Cooper plays the newlywed lawman who must flee town or face the killer coming on the noon train. He resolves to do just that despite the pleas of his loving wife. The sheriff scrambles against the clock to get help. However no one is brave enough to face the enemy with him. Even with the odds against him he faces them in a showdown.

So I expected some real magic here. But the film is really very simple. A very good character study and a film that doesn't depend on action and violence to tell it's story. The entire film is building it's way up to an unavoidable showdown that Gary Cooper's character will face. It's about honor and duty. While cooper is the epitome of the classic hero, he's also unsure of him self, scared, and desperately looking for some men to join him as deputies to take on a ruthless man he had put away years before that was just released from prison and will arrive on a train at twelve noon in this small town, looking for some payback. Cooper's character has plenty of chances to leave town but he doesn't. Even his wife can't convince him to leave. The idea is that he's determined to stand for his town no matter what the cost even though he's truly freightened. The acting is great and production values are not something special like an Orson Welles sort of thing, but very good. Other than that this film is sort of dull and uneventful. By the time the showdown happens it isn't like I was expecting at all. Cooper doesn't bravely stand in the middle of the town square like so many westerns have their heroes do, but instead cooper creeps around and hides and takes each bad guy out one at a time. I found the film marginally interesting but wonder what all the praise is about. I can't understand why it's a classic. I wasn't tremendously impressed with Citizen Kane either, and it's considered the greatest movie ever made. While I do agree that film is a classic and a masterpiece I just don't think it should be at the number one spot.

Gary Cooper is too old for the character he is cast to play.  He would have been more believable in the role the marshall's teacher played by Lon Chaney, than the marshall.  He is most definitely too old to be cast as a newlywed to the amazing and timeless beauty and talent of Grace Kelly - who is also wasted in this movie in such a small, barely supporting role capacity.

The film's ONLY redeeming quality is that it takes place almost in real time.  We know the train carrying the villain arrives at ""High Noon"" and it is approximately 10:30am the wedding services are finishing - leaving us approximately 90 minutes to build the suspense of the arrival of Frank Miller (the villain),

With the exception of some minor subplots along the way, that is all that we spend the next 90minutes doing - building suspense that leads to one of the most anti-climactic ""gunfight"" endings in the history of the western.",1361836800,,1157,4.39906103286385

3161047,4,B0016MLIKM,"The movie ""High Noon"" is a western about a man named Will Cain, who has to protect his town from a man he sent up the river, but gets off for an unknown reason. The movie starts off with Will and a woman named Amy getting married. When it cuts to the train station and three men are asking about the noon train. The train station man runs and tells Will. Will is leaving that night and retiring, but now that the man named Frank Miller is coming to town, Will decides to stay. Frank will be coming into town on the noon train, so Will has until then to raise a posse. There is only one problem, nobody will support the marshall with his mission to protect the town from Frank Miller. His deputy quits on him because he appointed an out-of-town marshall instead of him, the people in town (mostly at the bar) tell him that they will not help him because Frank is thier friend, and the people at the church tell him that they won't help fight a battle that he can avoid by just leaving town like he was going to anyways with his wife, who threatened to leave him because he wouldn't leave with her. Will is all alone and scrambling the whole movie until Frank shows up with the three boys of his crew, and start searching for Will. They start fighting, and Will kills one, then Will runs into a barn. Frank sets the barn on fire, but Will gets out on the side of a horse. He then runs into a little shop, and he kills another one of Franks boys. His wife, Amy, kills one of them and then gets taken hostage by Frank. He gets Will to come out, Amy bites Frank and gets away, then will shoots him. End of the movie basically. Very slow build and not much action, but I still enjoyed this movie.

3161048,4,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" was one of the top movies of the Twentieth Century, with not only bringing in fans of the western genre, but fans of drama, it is the perfect mix. With Fred Zinnemann leading the production as the director, who was known for his unique style of dramas, this movie was meant to be a hit.

 Will Kane, who is the longtime marshal of Hadleyville, which is located somewhere in the New Mexico territory, just married a pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler and gave up his dangerous job of being the marshal of this western town. By turning in his badge, he chooses to become a storekeeper of a shop elsewhere. But suddenly, the town he once protected has learned that Frank Miller- a vicious criminal who the ex marshal once before brought to justice- is arriving on the noon train. Then Will Kane must head back into Hadleyville to protect his former friends and neighbors from this criminal who is seeking revenge on Kane and the townspeople with his three gang members.

 This movie, which is set in real time, enhances your movie experience by you the viewer and the characters in the story learning everything together. Such as when Kane and the former criminal, Frank Miller, are closing closer and closer to one another, there are no cuts in time, you are there to witness everything in the full nail-biting eighty-five minutes.

 But, this is not the perfect movie. There are very few flaws, like the one I witnessed every once in a while was some of the actors could have been a bit sharper around the edges. Such as when Kane visits Frank Miller's first lover, Helen Ramirez, she could have been a lot better. She seemed to be very mono toned and did not show many emotions in her parts.

 All in all, this was a very impressive film considering the age and technology that was present at the time. Good job Freddy Z.",1357171200,,1825,4.5426829268292686

3161055,3,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper stars as Will Kane in Fred Zinnemann's Academy-award winning movie, 'High Noon'. The story begins with the former town Marshall's marriage to his Quaker wife, Amy, played by Grace Kelly.  Shortly thereafter he is told that Frank Miller, a criminal whom he had arrested, has been pardoned and is arriving on the twelve o'clock train to kill him. The newlyweds start to leave town, but Will's conscience makes him turn around to protect his town and honor.
  Cinematically, 'High Noon' was a good movie.  It was filmed in real time; Zinnemann's frequent shots of clocks create a sense of urgency as Will hurries to find men who will support him. The opening credits feature the song ""Do not forsake me'"" which won the 1952 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Not only did it set the tone for the movie, it also provided characterization for Will with lyrics like ""I only know I must be brave...or lie a coward, a craven coward.""
 Throughout the movie Will is faced with defending his reputation versus making his wife happy by not resorting to violence. Masculinity's importance is shown by Will risking his life to preserve his pride. Another important theme is age; Harvey, a young friend who hopes to become Sheriff, is seen as immature and inexperienced. After not being promoted, Harvey starts drinking. The bartender tells Harvey that he's doing the smart thing by not getting involved; this makes Harvey realize he doesn't want to do the reasonable thing- he wants to prove his masculinity.  Amy shows her age when trying to understand why Will refused to leave town. She comes to the conclusion that it is because of another woman, Helen. Helen points out Amy's immaturity by her not realizing that Will is a proud man who has to defend himself.
 'High Noon' is a classic Western movie recommended by some as ""a western movie for people who don't like westerns."" Running under 90 minutes, it's an ideal film for those who are interested in the western genre or who just want to see a classic film.",1356048000,,2017,4.762177650429799
3161056,4,B0016MLIKM,"The movie, ""High Noon"" illustrated one man's courage and personal code of honor, the traits that should be imminent in any and all lawmen. In this movie, it shows the corruption and how cowardly the town's people are and how in desperate need of a hero they are. Although they kept trying to kick Gary Cooper out, he ignores every excuse, overcomes his human fear of death and does the right thing. This movie shows how this could have really happened because there was no stupid standoff were he kills them all luckily. No instead it shows how someone would truly fight when outnumbered 4 to 1, through hit-and-run tactics and surprise attacks, picking one off at a time. Now even though this movie is outdated with its music choice, movie theatrics, and old movie ""magic,"" it makes up for that through story and moral teachings. A lot of modern day directors believe that just a bunch of explosions and raw action can make a good movie. They are clearly proven wrong with this movie. This movie is over 50 years old and still remains a highly rated movie and maintains about a $20 value which is what most new movies cost when they first come out. Through this you can conclude that the movie was so good, because it had not lost any of its value. To quote Sanpete, ""this true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors."" This statement could not be more on point in describing what this movie is about in a nutshell. To conclude this movie truly does deserve the rank of  #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 movies of the 20th century.",1355702400,,1690,4.6521739130434785

As a film, it is quite simply, beautiful and I know of no more compelling opening scene in any movie.

3161069,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"", number 2 on the AFI top 10 Westerns of all time, comes to Blu-ray disc in fine form. The remastering is not quite to the level of the 70th Anniversary edition of ""Casablanca"", yet this 60 year old, low budget, black and white movie looks and sounds very fine. Young folks of today, looking for 5.1 multichannel, will find a fine, if not quite perfect, DTS HD Master 1.0 audio. That is, mono was how most movies were originally seen at the time, and the audio well drives the movie story telling of ""High Noon"".

The movie opens with academy award winning original song, ""Do not Forsake me Oh My Darlin' "", sung by Tex Ritter, and we slowly close in on a young Lee Van Cleef, whom younger viewers surely recall from ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"". In a sense, ""High Noon"" is a spiritual predecessor of modern western films, advancing beyond the previous formula of good guy vs. bad guy; good guy prevails. Soon after the opening and credits, we come to the scene where Oscar winner Gary Cooper's character, Marshall Will Cane, is marrying a Quaker woman, a young Grace Kelly. The marshall is also about to retire; note the essential conflict between non-violent Quaker belief and the use of guns by a Marshall in the wild west. Likewise, there is conflict between the retiring marshall's duty to the town, his personal values, and whether to protect [the town]. A pardoned killer is returning on the noon train, who previously swore vengeance against some of the pillars of the town. The marriage takes place about 10:30, and the action proceeds towards noon in an approximate real time fashion, with prominent clock motifs propelling the action and suspense - who will help the Marshall, who will leave town, who will live or die.

Not only is the movie excellent in itself, but the presence of young actors who would later go on to fame is also interesting. To punctuate this, there is a fine extra about the making of the movie where we find out movie making details and some of the ""high Noon"" legacies in show business today, from Tex Ritter to John Ritter and more. Who would have thought of a ""Crosby, Stills and Nash"" connection to ""High Noon""? As well, aspects of the House Un-American Committee [the movie came out in 1952, the McCarthy era] are briefly discussed. A most worthy movie on any of its multiple levels - movie itself, Western movie history, young actors later famous for varying things, including Princess Grace of Monaco, and the complexities of human interactions given the different, conflicting and complex points of view of the various characters in  the film.",1343952000,,2603,4.691466083150985
3161070,5,B0016MLIKM,"There is not much more that can be said about ""High Noon"". Film critics and film historians as well as other directors have all called it one of the greatest films of all time(#27) according to the latest AFI survey. Another AFI survey ranked Gary Cooper's portrayal of Marshall Will Kane as the #5 film hero of all time(Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockinbird"" was voted #1). The film was made on a small budget($730,000) and had a 28 day shooting schedule. Written by Carl Foreman, produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by the great Fred Zinnemann, it can rightly be called a classic. I have owned every version of the film starting with the 40th Anniversary VHS from 1992 and the 50th Anniversary DVD Collector's Edition from 2002, both put out by Republic. I've never liked the picture quality of either of these, particularly the 2002 DVD Edition. When I heard that Paramount Pictures had purchased the Republic catalog my hopes were that they would release a Blu-ray edition in time for ""High Noon's"" 60th Anniversary in 2012. Paramount is releasing it's Republic catalog thru Olive Films for all their blu ray releases and ""High Noon"" is one of the first. I finally received it yesterday in the mail and watched it last night. Then I did a comparison with the 2002 Dvd edition. To be honest, there is no comparison. Olive Films has done a superb job with this edition and ""High Noon"" has never looked better. I was worried at first because this is my first experience with Olive Films. All that worry was in vain because this is the best version of ""High Noon"" in any format that I've ever seen. I won't go over the plot of the film. Nearly every film buff knows the story by now. Let's just say that this new blu ray version brings out the tension in all the characters even more. The close-ups of Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Katy Jurado, Lloyd Bridges and the rest of the cast are amazing in blu ray. I recently bought the blu ray of ""To Catch a Thief"" and not only does does Grace Kelly look beautiful in color, but looks even better in black and white. You can also feel all the emotion and pain in Cooper's face. Admittedly, he was really in pain during the shooting suffering from a bleeding ulcer. But he deservedly won the Best Actor Academy Award that year for his fine performance. Fred Zinnemann probably had something to do with that. He was an underrated director(along with Michael Curtiz) and very rarely gets mentioned when anyone talks about the great Hollywood directors. But the facts are certainly there. Pictures that Zinnemann directed amassed a total of 65 Academy Award nominations with 24 wins! He directed actors that appeared in his films to a total of nineteen Oscar nominations. It's remarkable because he didn't direct that many films compared to some of today's directors like Steven Speilberg, Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood. He's right up there with William Wyler, Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston and John Ford to mention just a few. I highly recommend this blu ray release thru Olive Films.

Not far from Jamestown is the historical Goldrush era town of Columbia California, where some High Noon scenes were shot. The town remains exactly as it was in the 1850's and is a great place to visit. The famous church scene in High Noon was filmed in the small, historical town of Tuolumne California.

3161082,4,B0016MLIKM,"I just finished watching Olive Film's Blu-ray release of High Noon, and the movie is still as suspenseful today as it was when released in 1952.  Using the film's running time in actual time adds to the urgency and growing desperation of Sheriff Will Kane as the clock ticks closer to noon when he will be in a duel with four men on the streets of the town he feels a moral responsibility to single-handedly protect.

It is quite well known that Gary Cooper was very ill with an ulcer problem during the making of the film, and that certainly added to his performance, for which he won his second Oscar (the first was for Sergeant York).  The almost visibly shaking of a man deserted by his friends to face four deadly killers is best reflected in his eyes, nervous but trying not to appear that way to others.

The Blu-ray is definitely superior to the previous DVD release.  It is extremely sharp, and I find it hard to believe it even looked this good on the original movie screen.

Audio, on the other hand, is where the Blu from Olive comes up way short.  They have chosen a mono audio that plays only on a center speaker.  I prefer the choice of an enhanced audio on the original DVD.

Also, the extras are, unfortunately, not all brought over from the DVD.  I realize Olive Films is infamous for having no extras on their Blu releases, and I guess we should be happy that we did get a documentary on the making of the movie from the previous DVD release, but there were others on that DVD release it would have been nice to get (a commentary and another documentary about the film).

3161100,1,B0016MLIKM,"Oh, my.

I wanted to see this because, essentially, it's a good story: A man fights for what is right despite the ambivalence of a town and the betrayal of beliefs by the town's upright citizens.

And I wanted to see the ""High Noon"" remake just to get away from that AWFUL and continual use of the original movie's tune almost every 30 seconds.

But this modern-day version is odious for many reasons.
Among them:
*The laughable and community-theater acting skills of all of the characters except Tom Skerritt. He does a capable job and collects his money and left on the noon train.
*The also laughable wardrobe of its characters. The new sheriff who is to take over Will Kane's (Skerritt's) job is outfitted in what can kindly be called a Hong Kong knockoff of a plastic faux leather coat. The bad guy/leader of the gang out to kill Kane is attired in a Dolce & Gabanna black outfit with what seems to be silk scarves around his neck. THIS GUY HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM A WESTERN PRISON!!! Did he stop off at a Chicago haberdashery before he comes to town to kill the sheriff and the judge?
As for costumes, the town seems divided along these lines: The well-attired townsfolks and the scraggly cowboy types. Thee is no middle ground. Either well-heeled or badly-heeled.
*Maria Conchita Alonso is laughable in her accented western English. The lines by most cast members seem delivered as if they are reading from a slow teleprompter. The men all seem to have shaved just before the cameras started rolling. Clean citizens, they are.

Susanna Thompson (the sheriff's new wife) seeems to be a refugee from the soap opera school of acting. Her lines are without real emotion and flat.
The telegraph operator seems to be another refugee but from the bad 1950s school of western acting. He's laughably skittish, skinny and always seems to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown.

Come on!
If you're gonna remake a classic, at least make an attempt at making a good product. Here's a hint: It was made by TBS Superstation, the credit says. No wonder.

At the end of the movie I pined for the classic. I even pined to hear that awful movie tune of the original playing every 30 seconds or so. This western needs to die a quick death. Either that or somebody get the sheriff to put me out of my cinematic misery.",1324425600,,2308,4.56280193236715

The comparison of Grace Kelly with a stagecoach is of course metaphoric, though she actually feels like having unlimited energy in keeping to her pacifist point; that, when she inadvertedly finds herself near the centre of action, she of course, Western ethic, vitally supports her husband goes without saying. One of the film's attraction was originally that it is one of the few real time movies in film history - ie it starts with the news of the arrival of the bandits by noon train about twenty to eleven and finishes by about seven minutes past noon.

3161106,5,B0016MLIKM,"A classic film that was not well received by its audiences (for not fitting the Western archetype with chases, lots of gunfights and epic scenery) but which was later recognized as AFI's 2007 list of great films. Eisenhower and Clinton cited this picture as their favorite film of all time and the latter is cited as having screened this one 17 times at the White House. Some might call that irony. The tale focused upon a newlywed sheriff torn between the love for his pacifist wife and his duty to stop some baddies coming into town. He decides that duty wins and goes about trying to get help from a mostly ambivalent town. Many considered this film to be an allegory of the Hollywood blacklisting of the old days. John Wayne was cited as calling this film ""Un-American"" and teamed up with Howard Hawkes to film RIO LOBO as a conservative response. Producer Carl Foreman was later blacklisted by Hollywood. When the Academy Awards came about and this movie lost it created one of the greatest uproars and many believed this was a way to appease Senator McCarthy who was hunting for Communists in Hollywood. Gary Cooper won an Oscar for Best Actor but was not there to receive it because of all the controversy. Ironically, John Wayne received it on behalf of Cooper. The film seemed to take the stance that pacifism is only useful up to a certain degree. The character's choice of a wife seemed strange compared to his former mistress who was more like him but then opposites sometimes attract (and a pretty white blonde is going to get more people in the seat than a minority woman I suspect for those times). Mexican actress Katy Jurado picked up Best Supporting Actress from the Golden Globves for her role and was thus the first Mexican American to ever win such an award.

3161119,5,B0016MLIKM,"There are innumerable imitations of this classic since its debut in 1952, which is testament to the power of its story and its telling. I was only four, so if my dad took me to this movie, I don't remember. However, I have seen it many times--and I don't tire of the story: Will Kane's (Gary Cooper) battle with fear and conscience. ""Am I a coward?"" is a question everyman asks when facing evil. In the end, Will is successful in facing this nemesis.

Their are so many big stars in this movie: Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado have the prime roles. Bad guys Ian MacDonald, Robert Wilke, Lee Van Cleef, and Sheb Wooley are menacing. The town folk are thoroughly convincing in their different excuses, underpinning Kane's plight. These actors include Thomas Mitchell, Otto Kruger, Eve McVeagh, Harry Morgan, and Lon Chaney, Jr. Howland Chamberlain acting is brilliant as the vengeful hotel clerk who wishes harm to Marshal Kane. Jack Elam also has a tiny bit part as one of two town drunks released before the final showdown.

3161122,5,B0016MLIKM,"Most reviews focus on the inner-turmoil/conflict of Gary Cooper's character and how he deals with this inner-turmoil/conflict; however, many reviews neglect completely to consider the extreme moral conflict experienced by the Grace Kelley character. Obviously, Cooper is THE star of the film while Kelley was still basically a new-comer to films. It has to be remembered that Kane's life has been one in which violence/death has been a major component.  His moral conflict is significantly different from that of his new wife. Kane is a world-weary realist who has no pretenses about the harsh, ugly, and often brutal realities of the world. On the other hand, his young and idealistic wife who was raised in the cloistered Quaker community has yet to see the extremely gross underside of humanity. She doesn't yet realize that survival is often based on violence; and that violence is the only ""language"" some people understand.

I'm of the school of thought that Kelley's character experiences a greater moral dilemma than that of Kane. She is forced to completely abandon her beliefs, code of ethics, and self-sacrificing mentality to save the life of the man she loves--both a noble and self-serving act. She is painted into a corner by circumstances in which she is forced to make agonizing life-choices; trying desperately to adhere to religious beliefs that involve the denial of self. Like Kane at the start of the film who can't run away and live with himself, Kelley's character can't run away at the end of the film and live with herself.  She has to go back and have her own personal showdown.

Because Cooper gets the bulk of screen-time, the viewer has a tendency to forget about Kelley's character and what's churning inside her. BOTH Kane and Kelley's character experience parallel conflicts/choices basically alone. Kelley's character is--in some ways--more alone because she is a stranger to the town. She has no one to turn to for counsel, except Kane's former romantic interest. What a terrible spot to be in. Cooper's and Kelley's characters validate the observation that most of life's toughest decisions are made alone.",1295481600,,2142,5.094017094017094

3161126,4,B0016MLIKM,"Critically, as the film was innovative in its structure (avoiding most real Western  `action' until the end of the film), and avoided a number of stereotypes popularized by higher profile filmmakers like John Ford and Howard Hawks, and Western icon John Wayne, derided it as un-American, as well as worse things. That is has become so lauded, even as it was a low budget project, with almost no great nor spectacular battle scenes, is another reason so many of the classic Western film lovers have railed at it. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby does a good, if not spectacular, job. There is one infamous goof that he and film editors committed, and that is in a crane shot, late in the film, where the camera pulls back and up to reveal the town deserted and Kane alone. Unfortunately, in the upper left hand corner of the film, telephone poles and wires are clearly visible. Crosby's mot notable touch was in not fetishizing the Western tableaux, instead not filtering the light reflected from the surroundings, which led to a blanched, dessicated look to the black and white cinematography; along the lines of then contemporary documentary films.

  The DVD, put out by Lionsgate, comes with two disks. Disk one is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the transfer is spotless. The remastering of the film is superb. It scintillates with clarity. It also includes an audio commentary by the progeny of many of the people involved- the late actor, John Ritter, Carl Foreman's son, Jonathan, Fred Zinneman's son, Tim, and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper-Janis. As in most commentaries featuring non-experts, this one quickly descends into meaningless banter and anecdotes, and many, `Gee, whiz, wasn't dad great' moments. The only comment of any worth comes when it's mentioned that, before he kills the first of the desperadoes, Kane calls out Miller's name, and shorts the man, therefore not plugging him in the back. The comment states this displays Kane's personal code of ethics, and while this is true, it is also one of the weaker moments in the film, because it goes against many of the other realistic moments (as does the plethora of 1950s-speak: Gollys and Gee whizzes abound)- a fact unmentioned in the commentary. But, good observations as this are rare on the track. Given the film's stature as a Western classic, one would have hoped for at least one expert commentary, by a noted historian of cinema. The second disk features a 50 minute making of film, Inside High Noon, and a shorter making of featurette. There is a featurette on singer Tex Ritter; a clip of Ritter singing the Oscar winning song Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' on the Jimmy Dean tv show, a featurette called Behind High Noon, and a radio broadcast featuring Ritter. All of these features are useful, but none is really standout, nor top of the line, compared to the best DVD features. The real killer, as mentioned, is no expert commentary track.

  High Noon is certainly a classic, and with a few better decisions scriptwise and characterwise, and with a few better decisions technically, it would truly have been a great film. Greatness and classicality, however, are unrelated beasts. This film is classic melodrama stripped to its naked rot, and plays out almost like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. Its narrative bears down upon the viewer like the train that carries Frank Miller. It has moments of poignancy (see the looks between Kane and Helen), black humor (see when the hotel clerk asks Kane if he can find Helen's room when the marshal ascends the stairs), and mythos (scan the characters' names and personal traits for counterparts in assorted mythologies); as well as an ability to amplify these characteristics (note how every shot of the clocks, which visually builds tension, is accompanied by a slightly strumming sound). Technically, the film is top notch, but its fundamentals sag a bit. If only the bulk of films today could display such vices and virtues, what a wonderfully mortal art the masses could wallow in.",1282780800,,4031,4.9017595307917885

Howard Hawks and John Wayne hated this movie and made Rio Bravo as a right-wing response to blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman and the film's message to Hollywood for the failure of the Hollywood people to stand up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era.  Wayne and Hawks hated that Will Kane ran around town like a ""chicken with his head cut off.""  Wayne's political views aside, the plot stands up.  Spineless townspeople is a Western staple, Kane could not run away because the killer would catch up to him and kill his new wife, too (is it really so terrible that the hero is not super-human?).  So, after calling in favors that didn't come through, he stands alone in one of the most famous shots in cinematic history (the crane shot of Kane standing alone in the middle of the street).

Cooper's performance as Will Kane, initially calm and assured about how to face his crisis, but increasingly nervous and hunted as he learns he must face it alone, is brilliant.

It is said that John Wayne (and some others) disapproved of the ending, where Will Kane takes off his badge and tosses it into the dust of the street ... feeling that it showed disrespect for the law and was unpatriotic.

I got something completely different from that act. It was clear to me that the character, who had been the town Marshall and protected these people for so long, was unequivocally separating himself from those who had betrayed him when he was the one needing help.

3161158,5,B0016MLIKM,"That's a simple western film, just before the renaissance of the genre with Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone and a few others. It is a classic of that period (1952) and in a way a turning point. A criminal was caught and sent to prison because one marshal and the population of a township did what they had to do. The criminal should have hanged but some law from Washington changed the game and he only got five years of prison. Five years later he comes back to kill those who had tried to have him hanged. The town learns about it when they see three of his associates come for the noon train, and it is confirmed by telegraph that the criminal, a certain Miller, is on the train. The city has a little more than one hour to do what they can to solve the problem. The marshal had just gotten married thirteen minutes earlier and he was to leave on his honeymoon and he was no longer the marshal and a new marshal was arriving on the following day only, slightly too late. The marshal comes back to assume the situation. He tries to get six deputies and the only he gets are a family man with two kids (he volunteers because he is convinced many more are going to come and he will step back when he finds out no one else has volunteered), then a one-eyed saloon customer who does not realize he is not fit for it, and a fourteen year old boy who is definitely too young and untrained. All the others refuse and even ask him to leave for Miller to do nothing. His newly-wed wife leaves on the noon train, or at least gets on it, though she will get off at the last minute. The judge leaves as soon as he can. The mayor asks in church the marshal to leave, while the parson refuses to commit himself (thou shalt not kill). All his friends avoid him or just plain say no. Alone he is and alone he will have to deal with the four outlaws who are trying to kill him. He will of course succeed. the details of his simple strategy and opportunistic tactics are in the film and you will have to go check them. And the film reveals how cowardly people can be and how they consider law and order is not their problem but that of the professional they pay to take care of it. That's the only really positive point that is different from the standard vision of traditional older western films. It is not blind gunfights and it is not everyone against the criminal. It shows the psychology of people in a crisis situation is very often divided and their reflex is often to hide their heads in the sand or run to cover behind the first bush they can find, senior or junior, who cares, provided it is not a burning bush.

3161161,4,B0016MLIKM,"This is a 2000 made-for-tv remake of the 1952 classic Western with Tom Skerritt in the Gary Cooper role. Both films are based on the novel ""The Tin Star"" by John W. Cunningham.

Skerritt plays just-retired, just-married Marshal Will Kane. He and his bride are informed that a man Kane put in the slammer years ago has been paroled; this owlhoot swore he'd kill Kane when he got out and he's coming in on the noon train. His henchmen are even waiting for him at the train station. Kane and his bride are encouraged to flee for their lives and start their new life together. Why not? -- he's not even a sheriff anymore. But the new Marshal won't arrive for another day or so and something in Kane prevents him from running like a cur with his tail between his legs. He has about an hour and fifteen minutes to marshal up help to make a stand. In addition to all this, his wife is a Quaker who doesn't believe in violence and threatens to leave him if he insists on staying and fighting.

One interesting facet of this Western is that the story plays out in real time. The film runs 88 minutes and Marshal Kane has just over an hour to prepare for the confrontation.

Skerritt does a good job depicting an aging man who is about to face a fight-to-the-death, most likely alone. I'm sure Marshal Kane has better things to do, like enjoy his honeymoon with his beautiful wife (Sussanna Thompson), but his manhood and sense of duty force him to courageously make a stand. This reminds me of times back in High School where I was scheduled to fight someone (after school or whatever). I knew at such-and-such time I was going to face so-and-so and a bunch of people would be watching. The anticipation wasn't fun but my manhood wouldn't let me back down. Of course there's no comparison since Marshal Kane is anticipating a gunfight wherein he could very likely die, not a mere fistfight, but if the anticipation before a fistfight is intense, how much more so a gunfight?

Some criticize the story of ""High Noon"" on the grounds that it makes the citizens of the average Western town out to be a bunch of cowards but, really, there are no less than four people who are willing to help the Marshal. Many of the others who decline have valid reasons for staying out of the fracas, although some are just plain yella.

Since Kane's new wife is a Quaker the film brings up the idea of total pacifism. While the idea is attractive and I understand her reasoning, total pacifism does not work in this present world. The New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. It teaches, rather, that pacifism is proper in certain situations and not in others. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. Even in cases where pacifism is called for a disciple is not to idly sit on his/her rump but to fight on a spiritual level and overcome evil with good. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extemists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. Kane's wife in the film is such a person, but perhaps she'll discover the error of her beliefs. In any case, ""High Noon"" makes an important point: Some people are so morally degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said ""ultimate"").

There are quite a few good parts, e.g. Kane's brief talk with the wife of a coward, the church scene and, of course, the ending gunfight.

As for comparisons to the original film, I have no bias or nostalgia. It's been years since I saw it (the '52 version) so it's not fresh in my memory, but I don't see how this remake pales in comparison as many of the reviewers here contend. This rendition is in color, has a good score, good actors and locations (CL Ranch, Calgary, Alberta). What more do you want? It may not have the cinematic pizzazz of modern Theatrical Westerns but, if given the choice between the two, I'd probably choose Skerritt's version over the original. Besides, I loathe black & white.

So, why not 5/5 Stars? Despite the story's potential and the anticipation of the gunfight, something prevents ""High Noon"" (both versions) from being truly captivating. In fact, it almost has a laid-back vibe. Needless to say, those with ADHD should avoid like the plague. Don't get me wrong, I love great drama and intelligent dialogue-driven stories but something needed done to make it a bit more engrossing and emotionally stirring.

That the film was ever made is the stuff of legend...A producer better known for contemporary 'message' films (Stanley Kramer), a European director who had never made a Western (Fred Zinnemann), a screenwriter about to be blacklisted for refusing to buckle under the paranoia of the times (Carl Foreman), and an ailing, aging superstar who was considered 'washed up' after a string of flops (Gary Cooper), combined their talents for a film that flew against all the 'rules' for a successful Western...filmed in black and while, in near-documentary style, with no sweeping vistas, and at nearly 'real' time...and stirred immediate controversy with it's less-than-flattering portrayal of a town's cowardice, incurring the anger of no less than John Ford, Howard Hawks, and John Wayne. Yet the film received 7 Oscar nominations, and 4 wins, including a 'Best Actor' Oscar for Cooper (which, surprisingly, was accepted by Wayne, as Cooper was unavailable). ""High Noon"" is on the short list of not only the 'Greatest Westerns', but 'Greatest Films' ever made, and is a film that deserves a spot in every DVD collection...it's that good!

3161183,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is an ""adult"" western in that the townpeople act like townspeople.  When faced by the possibility of an attack by five desperados, they prefer to do nothing and hope for the best.  The movie may have also had a political viewpoint.  We were locked in a deadly cold war with the Soviet Union.  Many people, just as the townpeople in ""High Noon"", reckoned that disarmament and coexistence was a safer policy than confrontation.

Gary Cooper, as the resigning marshal of this small town, expects support--in terms of a posse--from the townsfolk.  United they will outnumber the desperados many times and should be able to kill or capture them.  One by one, however, the would-be posse peals away.  Some won't fight for religious reasons, some for personal reasons, some for diability reasons and one, would be hero, is a drunk.

Cooper is left without allies and a bitter pill it is.  Even his beautiful wife [Grace Kelly] won't stay.  She wants them both to run. The only person who shows some guts is Katie Jurado who wants to fight for the marshal [and we know she would] but he belongs to another woman and so she gets out too.

Cooper, with every expectation of death on a dusty street, waits for the outlaws to arrive on the noon train.  Hollywood style, he manages to gun down his enemies and then, in front of the assembled townsmen, throws down his badge in total disgust.

It's a powerful film of a brave man and of human frailty.

I have heard from several sources that this release will have the restored by Paramount from the original negative film version that has never been released in the states.  I have not seen this version but have read rave reviews on it's extremely clean and sharp look with perfect brightness and contrast.  This print was not allowed to be loaned out for the previous two releases and an inferior print was used. In addition, a friend of mine John Mulholland has done a 50 minute documentory on this movie and he is an expert on both Gary Cooper and High Noon, so it is worth an upgrade just for that.  Below is an excerpt from John on High Noon:

""HIGH NOON was hailed upon its release in 1952 as an instant classic. It won several Academy Awards, including one for its legendary star, Gary Cooper. It was named the year's best picture by the New York Film Critics Society. And yet, even though it's high on the American Film Institute's 100 Best Films of the Century, HIGH NOON's respect has been hard won, indeed. Perhaps no other classic film has had such a rocky road as this ""simple little western.""

Decried by influential auteurist critics and academics, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being untrue to the western genre - read anti-populist; for being ""middle-brow"" (whatever that might mean); for being social drama hiding behind the western genre - and muddled social drama, at that; for being the most un-American film ever made (courtesy of John Wayne), etc.

However, 56 years after its release, HIGH NOON still powerfully resonates with audiences around the world. When Solidarity needed a universal image to promote democracy and the right to vote in Poland in 1987, they chose Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, a ballot in his hand rather than a gun. Conservatives and liberals both manage to cite HIGH NOON on the floor of Congress as a metaphor for their competing political ideals. Political cartoonists and headline writers inevitably use HIGH NOON as reference for countless crises. President Eisenhower cited High Noon as his favorite film, as have President Clinton and former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizuma.

On one hand, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being a conservative, damaging portrait of arrogant male paternalism. On the other hand, HIGH NOON is praised for challenging entrenched notions of gender, for exploring masculine anxiety, masculinity as a construct. Feminist critics and academics are offering intriguing and complex new readings to HIGH NOON.

Example: Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) is having her new husband, Marshall Will Kane (Cooper), quit his career, leave his town, leave his friends, marry outside his church, and open a store of her choosing (wearing, perhaps, an apron?). Does Will Kane take on the villains at noon as a final gasp of masculine protest, as a declaration of independence from his wife's control?

Ernest Hemingway compared a story's meaning to an iceberg - like the iceberg, 7/8th of which lies hidden beneath the surface, 7/8th of a story's meaning lies beneath the surface.

Carl Foreman's bare-to-the-bones script and Fred Zinnemann's equally spare direction are a perfect film correlative to Hemingway's iceberg theory. This taut, seemingly straightforward little suspense western is complex, multi-layered, and perhaps even more relevant today than when it opened 56 years ago.

3161212,3,B0016MLIKM,"This movie is more than 56 years old and yet it is still relevant and enjoyable today as it undoubtedly was back in those days.  This is because the themes are recurring and just as it was then, it is still the same now with regards human nature.  The parable of the Good Samaritan covers it and so does this wonderful classic film about the sins of omission being just as bad as sins of commission.  Is it okay to let a man go to his death because it is none of your business or is it just as good as if you had pulled the trigger yourself?  Here, Gary Cooper plays a very capable marshall who has managed to selflessly keep his town safe but when it comes to the marshall himself needing some help, the townspeople make up excuses to avoid putting themselves in danger when the marshall himself had been doing this on their behalf for years.  How often do we commit sins of omission ourselves by making excuses to not do the right thing?  This sad and sorry aspect of human nature was present in the parable of the good samaritan, this film and will probably continue to exist today and ever after.

Cooper's performance is brilliant and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar for this film.  People confuse courage with having no fear which is a mistake.  Courage is doing the right thing especially when you are afraid and to do so the more afraid that you are, the more courageous you are.  To have no fear ever is not courage but insanity.  I especially love the part when Cooper admits to Bridges that he was afraid and yet continued to do the right thing.  There are lots of lessons here that we can all learn that are timeless and for this reason, this film will continue to be a classic and relevant for ages to come.

The only problem is with the DVD; the special features consist of a good but not great documentary concerning the making of High Noon.  Although the sound has been THX mastered, the sound quality isn't noticeably much better and could have used a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround treatment or better.  The picture quality is not very good either with imperfections ala white spots and vertical lines every couple of seconds or so of footage.  Although I've seen worse picture quality on other dvds, you'd expect better for a classic film like this one.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-Ray, they will take advantage of the opportunity to properly restore the picture and improve the sound quality options.

Great must-have movie in any film buff's library but you may want to wait for a much better restored version either in Blu-Ray or standard format.

The Olive blu ray release is a noticeable upgrade from the standard dvd release I reviewed 8 years ago.  It took me this long to make the upgrade and only after I'd heard comparisons with Criterion releases for Olive releases.  Based upon this release I think Criterion can rest easy at least for now.  This Olive release has much improved picture quality over the standard dvd although heavy DNR is evident in several scenes throughout.  This means dark and white spots and other picture imperfections are almost completely gone but at the expense of sharpness in many scenes.  There is some ghosting in the fast-moving scenes and some dirt at points but you'd have to try hard to notice them.  The sound quality is DTS-HD MA Stereo and is better than a mono presentation on the standard dvd and noticeably less noisy.  Also included is a booklet containing the essay ""Uncitizened Kane"" by Nick James which is a nice touch.  Special features are sparse relative to the usual Criterion release but it's clear who Olive are aspiring to imitate.  Overall not a perfect release but not a terrible one either and this is still superior to the old standard dvd that I reviewed above.  However, I can't help but feel that there is a better quality release out there in the near future.  Who knows, maybe Criterion will get a crack at this too?  Get this if you can't wait but a better version may still be on the horizon.

3161217,5,B0016MLIKM,"Lionsgate has announced a new DVD release of High Noon with new special features.  There is what appears to be a reliable report, though unconfirmed, that it will include a new transfer of the film, restored by Paramount.  The current and older DVDs are only of average video and audio quality.

This a true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors.

Town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is caught between his new pacifist Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) and a felt duty to face down evil men coming on the noon train to take revenge on him (and presumably cause whatever other trouble they please).  Most of the drama takes place in the lead-up to a climactic battle, as the townspeople choose whether to support Kane with action or to let him stand alone.  Amy too must choose between her spouse and her own moral beliefs.  The tension builds relentlessly as we see clocks ticking towards noon.  The innovative black and white cinematography emphasizes the dramatic points, while the internal drama is captured in Cooper's face.

The new DVD features are these:

-- ""Inside High Noon,"" a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (see below for more on this)
-- ""Tex Ritter: A Visit to Carthage, Texas,"" on the Tex Ritter Museum
-- the full performance of ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'"" from the Jimmy Dean TV Show

The features carried over from the current release are:

-- commentary with Gary Cooper's daughter Maria Cooper Janis, screenwriter Carl Foreman's son Jonathan Foreman, director Fred Zinneman's son Tim Zinnemann and Tex Ritter's son John Ritter
-- ""The Making of High Noon"" featurette
-- ""Behind High Noon"" featurette
-- radio broadcast with Tex Ritter

Whether the new features will warrant an upgrade is a matter of personal preference, of course.  A 50-minute documentary could be quite interesting, if it's well done.

It does sound interesting.  The ""new"" documentary, actually made a couple years ago but shelved until now, is by film and Gary Cooper expert John Mulholland.  It's expected to cover, among other things, the conflict between Cooper and John Wayne over the participation of the blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman.  Given that the film is intended in part as an allegory of the public's acquiescence in the Red Scare, this will have more than the usual gossipy behind-the-scenes relevance.  It includes interviews with three of the children of the principles who participated in the DVD audio commentary: Cooper's daughter Maria, director Zinneman's son Tim, and Foreman's son Jonathan.  There are also interviews with Grace Kelly's son Prince Albert of Monaco, Western and film historians Brian Garfield, Lee Clark Mitchell, Stephen Prince and Meir Ribalow, and High Noon fan President Bill Clinton.  The narration is by actor Frank Langella.

Lack of agreement between Paramount and Lionsgate prevented the earlier release of a restored transfer and the documentary, in case you're wondering why this didn't come out before.

A parting note on the ethical side of the film.  While everyone can appreciate the strength of Cooper's character and the contrast to the weakness of others, which is no doubt the intended moral focus, we can wonder why the seemingly parallel choices facing Will and Amy are treated differently, with one portrayed heroically for choosing perceived broader duty over duty to spouse, while the other is seemingly approved in doing the opposite (those who have seen the movie will be able to see how that is).  I'm not sure writer Foreman saw that parallel as I put it here, and maybe there are good reasons to argue they aren't really parallel.  It could be a statement about the limits of pacifism, or it could be a reflection of other cultural mores that Foreman didn't question.  Or it could be largely motivated by the need for a certain kind of ending.  I'm not a film historian, so maybe these questions have already been addressed.  If so, feel free to leave a comment about it.",1206835200,,4438,4.98100407055631

3161242,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon  vs. Rio Bravo?

Should we think of it as a competition when Rio Bravo was made as a protest against the way Will Kane had to go around the town looking for special deputies only to get turned down?

The behind-the-scenes talk is that both John Wayne and director Howard Hawks had contempt for High Noon and the way its protagonist went looking for help to fight the bad guys.  Guess these two guys never heard of the Second Amendment or even of special deputies or posses!

Actually as stand-alone stories both movies have messages worth learning.  One should see true life experiences in both of them.  In High Noon the town's people all had excuses for why helping out their marshal wasn't good for them at the moment.  Good thing the men who fought for us in the Revolutionary War didn't refuse to join the Army because they ""got a wife and kids"".

And make no mistake, the U.S. Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment in the base of our political system as a way for the citizenry to remain armed in order to oppose tyranny.  Now it may be true that they were worried more about tyranny from oppressive governments both foreign and domestic, but just how good would the people of Kane's town be against tyranny on a national scale when they couldn't even be bothered to stand up against it in their own back yard?

In High Noon Will Kane eventually finds help from his own wife who comes to see that she owes more loyalty to her vows to her husband than to some goofy religious belief that says that to fight evil you lie down in front of it and spread your legs -- figuratively, if not literally.

In Rio Bravo the sheriff says upholding the law is the job of professionals, then what does he do?  Like his friend says, he employs a drunk and a cripple, and then decides he needs more help and looks to a teenager and deputizes the kid.  LOL  Said cripple, by the way, who so unprofessionally shoots and nearly blows the head off of a fellow deputy and can't even admit it when he made a mistake.  (""How was I supposed to know the Dude was gonna go and git hisself duded up?  Huh?...  HUH???"")  And then when Feathers tries to sit guard in the lobby of the hotel and falls asleep Chance treats her tenderly for her effort and carries her off to bed.  Looks like Wayne and Hawks couldn't make up their minds just what it was they believed!  Sort of schizoid, IMO.

Too bad for them, but no reason for us to not take away some important lessons from both of these movies, one of which is that it seems it is never comfortable or convenient nor can we expect the timing to be ""right"" when we are called upon to stand up against evil; and having one's personal demons going on inside is no excuse to bow out of the fray, turn inward, and forsake the common good.",1201996800,,2781,4.338491295938105
3161243,4,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon (Fred Zinnemann, 1952)

Note: here be spoilers. On the off chance that you haven't seen or heard anything about the movie, you may want to skip this review.

There's a scene in High Noon that just makes it for me. It's pretty close to the end, right at the point where Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has realized that no one in town is going to help him fight Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and his gang, and resigned to his fate, he leaves his office and heads up to the depot to confront Miller. As he walks down the street, the camera pulls away from him to an aerial view, but there's nothing smooth about the pullback; it's jerky and swerving and jolting, as if the whole town is about to fall down around Kane's ears, or as if to simulate what must be going on in Kane's stomach, or both. How often do you see that in a movie nowadays? (,he says just after writing reviews for No Country for Old Men and The Dreamers.) It's not so much the symbolism of the thing as the fact that it seems so natural, as if someone on the set said, ""hey, we've got a pullback here, wouldn't it be neat if we did this with it...?"".

It's probably inexcusable for someone who fancies himself a media critic to have seen as few Gary Cooper movies as I have in my lifetime, but after finally seeing High Noon, I plan to watch a lot more of them. Cooper is as laconic as he is iconic, the plain-spoken good guy who realizes he's got a job to do whether anyone wants to help him with it or not. He comes off as a bit dour, which makes me wonder why his new Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) would have married him in the first place, but that's a minor thing. Kane's demeanor sets him apart not only from the bad guys (and a fine batch they were-- MacDonald is backed up by country singer Sheb Wooley, prolific character actor Robert Wilke, and a young lee van Cleef), but from the townsfolk; not a coincidence, one thinks, especially given the film's oft-noted red scare subtext (the subtext that caused John Wayne to remark that High Noon was the most anti-American movie ever made).

Honestly, now that I've opened that door, I can't see the red scare subtext as valid to criticism of the movie any more. It was half a century ago, and we all realize it was idiotic (at least, I hope we do). Ignore it when watching the movie now. There are so many other reasons to like the movie. Zinnemann's casting was dead-on for almost every role, even in the places where he ended up using his fifth or sixth choice for a role (Gary Cooper was far from Zinnemann's first choice for Kane, for example). Cooper and Kelly are fantastic, and their odd lack of chemistry is offset by the fact that the two have very few scenes together. The rest of the townsfolk are uniformly excellent, as is to be expected when one's talent pool contains such notables as Harry Morgan, Lon Chaney Jr., Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado. Zinnemann's direction is excellent, coupled with Floyd Crosby's groundbreaking cinematography, which is played up quite nicely with Elmo Williams' editing (Williams is responsible for the real-time aspect of the film, which was originally meant to run a good deal longer; Crosby was the guy who figured out how to make the film look so sere. No, you're not watching a faded print). A number of very talented folks worked on this movie, and they all brought their A games. One for the ages. ****",1201564800,,3382,4.39776357827476
3161244,5,B0016MLIKM,"HIGH NOON (1952-NR) stars Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly (her first role) and Lloyd Bridges and is arguably the best western of all time. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards and winner of 4. Also, AFI Top 100 of all time. Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just said his wedding vows with his new bride (Grace Kelly) and is about to turn in his badge as sheriff and leave the town he had singlehandedly cleaned up, with his pacifist Quaker wife. As they're about to ride out of town in their buckboard limo, three tough hombres ride into town and let it be known that Frank Miller is arriving on the noon train-it's now 10:40 AM. Will leaves but just out of town turns around and comes back.  He can't leave now.  He's responsible for arresting Frank Miller and sending him up to prison.  He was supposed to be executed but instead he's paroled and coming back to get even. Will believes he can round up a posse to defend the town during the next hour as the film progresses in real time. The plot is simple but the acting is terrific and the scenes are tight and tense as he tries to recruit help as well as keep his new bride. All this leads up to the showdown at HIGH NOON and the final, climactic scene-a great one. More than just a good western, there are some underlying themes of courage (and lack thereof) as well as the issue of pacificism and 'standing by your man'. This is the role that got Grace Kelly's career on track.  One interesting note-on Netflix there's a commentary on issues for parents to judge whether a film is suited for children and what age. Under the category of SOCIAL BEHAVIOR it says ""Women are exceptionally intelligent and respected"". Apparently that was not the norm for films back then. Everyone should see this at least once.

Be sure to watch film historian Leonard Maltin's segment at the end of the film where you will have the privilege of seeing some of the main artists involved in the making of the film talk about it.  It is fascinating.

Without Gary Cooper, I don't believe this film could or would have been made.  It required an actor who was an ambivert - not totally introverted or he could not have portrayed the role, but not totally extroverted either, or we would not have the nuances of an inner life which shown through Cooper's performance.  His was the academy award that year, and it was wholly deserved.

If you haven't seen this film, don't hesitate.  I somehow compare it to another great film, ""Grand Illusion,"" also filmed in black and white with a low budget.

High Noon (DVD)

High Noon (1952) might very well be the best Western movie ever made.  It stars Gary Cooper as the town Marshall and Grace Kelly as his new bride.

The movie opens with the Marshall getting married and concomitantly the telegraph operator receiving an alarming telegraph.  The telegraph operator writes out the message, the Justice of the Peace reads the wedding ceremony.  Will the Marshall get married before the telegraph message can be delivered? The telegraph operator finishes and runs out the door toward town,.  ""He's moving pretty fast for a Sunday"" comments a bystander  The telegraph operator runs, the Justice of the Peace reads, will he make it?  Yes, they're pronounced Man and Wife.  Yeah!

The telegraph operator burst into the room.  ""Marshal, Marshal, you have a telegram"" The Marshal reads that a murderer who he helped arrest just got pardoned.  Probably by a` Democrat Governor.  Remember Bill Clinton's pardons?  The murderer, Frank is expected on the noon train.  Close up of the clock, eighty-four minutes from now.  Meanwhile three of Frank's friends ride into town and wait for the noon train.  Pretty obvious what they're waiting for.  Meanwhile the townspeople try to bundle the Marshall and his bride out of town on a buckboard.  The Marshall makes it a ways out of town, then stops the buckboard and turns to his bride and says ""  I just can't do it""  I can't run away .  His bride, a Quaker, disagrees with him and wants him to run away.  When they get back to town.  His bride lays out an ultimatum.  Choose, either leave town or lose me,  The Marshall stays.

For the next sixty minutes or so the Marshal has all his ""friends"" turn against him, one after the other.  Nobody is willing to help.  It looks like it `s going to be four against one, with the Marshall being the the one.  The suspense slowly builds until there is a mighty climax at the end.

You'll just have to watch the movie to see how it ends.  It's worth it.

Highly recommended for fans of the old fashion Western movie.

3161264,5,B0016MLIKM,"That's how Kane must have felt: if he runs, Miller will chase him down and kill him; if he stays to fight, the townspeople will not lift a finger to help him. His only choice is to stay and fight, hoping against all odds that he will still be alive when it is over.

As I watched the film, I could sense that Kane must have had serious doubts as noon approached. Too late to run, even if it could have done any good. The townspeople - his so-called ""friends"" - abandoning him in his hour of need. One minute they are grateful for all that he has done for them and the next minute, they are writing him off for dead and making plans on how to live with Miller and his gang after they kill the marshall. Okay, not ALL the townspeople turned their backs on him. There was a young boy who Kane would not allow to fight, being so young. Another was a drunk, who doubtless truely wished to help, but would have ben no real good to the marshall. There was an eager volunteer who backed-out once he realized that it would only have been the two of them against Miller and his gang. Lastly, there were a few men who did volunteer to assist Kane, only to back-out after being talked out of it by their fellow townspeople. So, in the end, Kane stood all alone on an empty street. He even watched as his wife and former girlfriend rode past him on their way to board the very same train that Miller arrived on!

Even though I knew how it would all end, having read about this film and never having seen it before, I had this strong feeling of tension as noon approached. I could even feel the twisting knot in my stomach as I saw the camera pan back, showing Kane standing alone on the street, with no one else around. Suspending disbelief, I wondered what Kane was thinking as the showdown approached.

In the end, of course, Kane was alive and as he boarded his coach to leave town for the final time, I could also feel the strong sense of disgust at the townspeople for their cowardice and I could easily understand why he dropped his badge in the dust before boarding the wagon. If just four men had positioned themselves with rifles in windows overlooking the street, the fight could have been over in seconds, with only the outlaws getting killed and no one else hurt or endangered. Despite their superiority of numbers and the fact that had superior firepower over the outlaws, if only they had utilized it, they still cowered behind their doors and waited until the end.

John Wayne's feeling towards this movie notwithstanding, this is a true American story: one man, standing alone against evil, despite all odds and having been abandoned by everyone he thought he could trust to help him.

This western diverged from its colleagues because it is about duty, responsibility,

3161309,5,B0016MLIKM,"It is considered one of the ""classic"" Westerns, but the reality is that it bears little to no resemblance to the standard oater.  Aside from a brief tussle between Cooper & Bridges, there is no action until roughly the last 10 minutes of the movie.

It is interesting how widely perceptions vary with this movie.  To me, that is the hallmark of good work, because the answers aren't in black & white.  Again, not the typical Western.  We know that the outlaws are the bad guys, but are the townspeople also villains, or are they simply trying to do the best they can to protect their own collective self-interest by choosing the past of least resistance?  Is Will Kane a hero, or is he too proud to run --- or is he, like the townspeople, simply calculating what is in his best interests?  After all, he has a better chance of protecting himself within the city limits than he does out on the open prairie --- he says as much himself.  He takes the gamble that enough townspeople will appreciate the job he has done as marshal & will help him face the outlaws --- as it turns out, he guesses wrong and has to face the music.  It would have made a most interesting outcome if Will Kane had been gunned down in the streets, and the townspeople also made to face the music for their own decisions.

As has been said time and again, this started out as a subtle allegory of the failure of intellectuals to stand up to the persecutions of HUAC and McCarthy, but the themes of the film now transcend those topical references and keep it from being dated.  Of course, it is the definitive Gary Cooper role --- in many ways more vulnerable than heroic.  One can see in his face that he knows damned well that he'll probably be dead in a few minutes, and it makes his character all that much more compelling as a result.

Everybody should be able to identify with this story --- at one time or another, we've practically all been a Will Kane or a citizen in the town, and we've had to make the tough decisions.  This alone should make ""High Noon"" ring true for every viewer.",1172448000,,2065,4.371727748691099

3161311,4,B0016MLIKM,"The characters in this drama really stick in your brain somehow. Gary Cooper of course, but also Grace Kelly and Lloyd Bridges. My favorite is Katy Jurado as the Spanish lady still in love with Gary Cooper. Her voice is wonderfully husky and smoky. The way she puts down Lloyd Bridges is incredible: ""You're a handsome boy with broad shoulders, but HE [Cooper] is a MAN."" And she tells Grace Kelly, ""If he were my man, I would never leave. I would stay and fight. "" Katy Jurado as Ellen Ramirez is just so incredible. It's a great movie, but it doesn't have the depth of many other westerns. It suffers for being a shallow allegory of McCarthyism. As someone else pointed out, it's Cooper's job to defend the town, not the civilians'.",1164412800,,734,4.526315789473684
3161312,4,B0016MLIKM,"I enjoyed High Noon quite a bit and despite of my desire to do so, I won't go into the details that have been repeated many times over by others who wrote a review on this movie. This movie was Gary Cooper's finest effort and as a man in trouble, he was totally believable and totally real. But I have to take John Wayne's perception on this movie and states that its not as great as the hype made it up to be. Cooper played a sherriff of this town who is awaiting recently released gunmen from prison. They are professional gunsligners and Cooper's character wanted amatuer townsmen to aid him. Professional killers needs professional lawmen to deal with, Cooper is that man and the burden fall on him. His effort to induced untrained townsmen who are not fit to support him into this situation sounds pretty weak and perhaps in the western mode...unmanly. His new wife played by Grace Kelly only further do damage by trying to make a coward out of a man she married. She failed to see that if she secceded, she would have ruin the man she love by making him what he wasn't. But despite of his doubts, fears and lack of support, Cooper's character does his job effectively and with honor. Maybe it is a great western after all.

Unlike many reviewers before me, I take a very different view of this film. Many believed that Gary Cooper is some sort of victim forced into a confrontation against all odds. I see it differently. Many western fans often compared this with Rio Bravo where the sherriff refused help from town's people he believes to be unfit to do the job, thus keeping them from harm's way - which is his job as well as the job of Will Kane.",1164240000,,1656,4.411764705882353
3161313,5,B0016MLIKM,"For many, Gary Cooper was the Westerner par excellence--cool, taciturn, courageous and just; skilled with a gun but slow to use it; gentlemanly, generous and shy, appealing to men as much as to women... This image reached its culmination in ""High Noon"" with his characterization of Marshal Will Kane, the brave and stubborn ex-marshal standing alone against the forces of evil, and the prototype for countless Western heroes ever since...

Highly-stylized, carefully and beautifully shot, ""High Noon"" possibly owes its great popularity to a combination of three things--It's a suspense film in the real sense; the dearly beloved set-piece climax of the gun duel never got better or more thoughtful treatment; it has a theme tune that persistently whines its way into the subconscious... Most people first remember the Dimitri Tiomkin theme tune, then Gary Cooper stalking down the lonely street... The bits and pieces gather from there... The film also ties a small town of do-nothings showing their cowardice by turning their backs on trouble, integrity, and an elected representative...

""High Noon"" is also distinguished by many fine images from the incidental (the brief close-up of the wagon wheel revolving against the town's facades as Cooper and Kelly leave the community); to the poignant ( Zinneman's camera drawing back from Cooper's face to show him standing vulnerable and alone in the dust of a deserted main street); to the deliberately melodramatic (Cooper bitterly grinding his marshal's badge in the dirt before riding away for good ).

By means of rapid cross-cutting, Fred Zinnemann gives shots--repeatedly--of the pendulum of the clock, of the empty railroad tracks, and in rapid succession, shots of tense faces--taken at close range--of the townsfolk in the church, in the local saloon, then of the worried face of the marshal, his wife, and of the three criminals ready for the approaching train...

""High Noon"" is the simple and forceful tale of an aging lawman on his day of retirement and also on his wedding day...

Will Kane, on a blazing June morning in 1875, has just married a pretty young Quaker girl... The bride feels doubly blessed... She's got her man, and this is the day he will hang his guns... She has firm Quaker convictions and never did imagine herself as a lawman's wife...

But, while it's all being celebrated a badly shaken stationmaster (Ted Stanhope) bursts in with quite the wrong kind of wedding telegram... It states that an outlaw Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) whom Kane had put behind bars six years ago for terrorizing the town has been released... The stationmaster adds that three members of his old gang are already awaiting his arrival at the depot--their object a reunion with the pardoned man who will get off the train at noon, and presumably settle the score with Kane...

The marshal, like a sensible man, does, in fact, put his wife in the buggy, but then like a man of honor but also a sensible man (for the gang will surely hunt them down wherever they go) changes his mind and heads the horses back to town...

A bride, especially a Quaker bride, can't quite see it this way on her wedding day so she hands him her own ultimatum--if he won't go away with her she'll go alone by train--the one that leaves at twelve...

Everything on this torrid, dusty morning therefore hinges on midday--therefore Kramer's insistence on his clocks. From this point onwards High Noon, although it remains completely classic in Western terms, faithful to period and concerned with an indicative historical situation, takes on wide and profound implications...

It's about group cowardice and short-term interest--particularly the treachery of so-called 'good' people... 'Law abiding,' you feel, doesn't mean what it should mean... When a group of people decide that they must passively refuse to support the law for reasons of personal preservation, who, in fact, are the outlaws?

Thus the marshal's predicament... He is an embarrassment to everyone, from Judge (Otto Kruger)--he's leaving town--to the humblest citizen of Hadleyville... Only one is ready to give assistance and he melts away when he finds there'll be no other volunteers... The marshal's immature deputy (Lloyd Bridges) is willing to take over his job--again, provided Cooper leaves town... But this is absolute ambition at work...

The build-up of tension as the lawman prepares to meet the four thugs and makes fruitless attempts to recruit help from the cowardly citizens has never been handled better, and it is sustained right up to and through the climactic gunfight as the lawman's bride finds herself trapped in the crossfire...

Filmed in Black and White, ""High Noon"" is among the ten Best Westerns ever made... The film achieved the shape of a democratic allegory which reached people in much the same way and for the same reasons that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" had done... Its cutting suspense was the hallmark of Zinneman's mastery of the movie medium...

Gary Cooper's performance, as the very vulnerable, worried man, won him the year's Oscar...",1163030400,,5082,5.070658682634731

3161315,4,B0016MLIKM,"This is a film based on the western novel, The Tin Star.  This particular version is a Ron Hardy remake (headlining Tom Skerritt) of the Gary Cooper movie classic by the same name - High Noon.

The story is austerely set in an Old West town, and is simple . . . the bad guy has been released from prison and is arriving on the noon train.  He will seek revenge on the Marshal.  The bad guy is bringing friends.  Sounds pretty familiar.  Add that the Marshal is a newlywed, and ready to retire.  He also has an old flame in town.  The townspeople love him but will not physically risk themselves to help him.  The Marshal is facing this alone and has a bad feeling about his situation but is resolved to be faithful to his duty.  It's a good story, but simple and puts a big load on the lead actor to pull it off well.

I'll go ahead and jump onboard the comparison wagon (everyone else has), and comment on this version as compared to the original. Reviewers are being really tough on this remake, but, my opinion . . . if you've never seen the original, you'll enjoy this.  If you have already seen the original, you'll probably still enjoy this.  A film remake analogy that comes to mind is the great, On the Beach, from Neville Shute's novel.  The original was one of the greatest films of all time.  The remake is a pretty good film.

This newer version is missing a few things - mainly Gary Cooper. It also lacks that classic music theme and the general ambiance of those great 40's/50's Hollywood westerns.  On the upside, Tom Skerritt does a very good job of selling himself as an aging and vulnerable lawman ready to retire.  Susanna Thompson was rather weak as the newlywed Quaker bride, but the rest of the supporting cast is adequate.  Production values are moderately good and the set is believable with plenty of mud and general grunge that was lacking in the original.

It was a nice re-visit to a favorite old movie tale.",1161820800,,1936,4.4
3161316,5,B0016MLIKM,"I have read a number of good reviews of this DVD on this site, especially the one written by Dennis Littrel. I will thus only add a small personal impression. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself. This is not what we were expected to see from Western heroes. Also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win. Also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person. If he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly Mexican woman?

I am only speaking about my own naivete of course.

I too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety.

This is to say that while I sensed somehow the movie is 'good' I could not because of the perplexity I felt , enjoy it.

The good guy does not run. He does stand up and alone face the bad guys. His fiancee though she has principles of non- violence when it comes down to it does the 'realistic and necessary thing' to save the one she loves.

A realistic moral Hollywood drama , and of course made haunting by the 'Do not Forsake me Oh my darling' in the background.",1150761600,,1253,4.204166666666667
3161317,5,B0016MLIKM,"It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it's rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because ""I have to,"" and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.

Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and ""courage under fire,"" a character who says in the novel that ""abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene""? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing.

It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like ""24,"" and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway. It's a timeless idea, and the movie is a classic.",1143590400,,1733,4.446540880503145

Gary Cooper in one of his outanding performances proves that this movie will forever become a favorite of all times. This movie should undoubtably become part of every movie collectors library,",1140652800,,427,4.618421052631579
3161339,5,B0016MLIKM,"A heroic tale of individualistic morality that that has no identifiable political overtones as many suggest but a philosophical one of confronting the threat of wrong doing by proper action.

The movie is not a romantic theme of one against many nor a moral crusade but clearly stresses the impact that one can have on the few or many.

when put into difficult choices the imperative that ones conscience needs to be the only moral guide ruling passion plays the leading role in this movie.

The fact that Marshall Kane confronts a murderer with the resolve of keeping the peace and harmony for the town doubled later with his Quaker wife acting against her pacifistic philosophy by thwarting the murderous outlaw Miller is a a case in point of a clear situation of confronting evil as an individual matter despite the common folk wisdom of the day as shared by the apathetic town who remain isolationist despite the clear and present danger of having the outlaw Miller return and wreak havoc not only the Marshall but the possible return into anarchy and lawlessness that once ruled prior to Kane's triumph the first time around.

The movie poses a few aspects governing life.

1. Can one man make a difference in the overall moral compass?

2. Why do people act fearfully when confronting wrong?

3. When is it acceptable to go against the majority opinion of a society when the society is wrong?

4. The need at times for quick decision making even when the odds are stacked against you.

The movie depicts these questions and answers forcibly on the side of justice and righteousness.

3161340,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon (1952) is one of the best Western films ever made, but some critics see it as a parable of events in Hollywood at the time, especially the Cold War, the persecution of un-American screenwriters (in retrospect justified), and attitudes of pacifism, etc. This may be the case, but really it's a story about a man who is too proud to run.

It is a taut, tightly-scripted, minimalist film sharply focused on the tale of a solitary, stoic, honor-bound marshal/hero, past his prime and already retired, who is left desolate and abandoned by the townspeople he has faithfully protected for many years.

Due to the townspeople's cowardice, physical inability, self-interest, expediency, and indecisiveness, he is refused help at every turn against a revenge-seeking killer and his gang. Fearful but duty-bound, he eventually vanquishes the enemy, thereby sparing the town from the outlaws. Embittered by film's end, he tosses his tin star into the dirt as if to say to the town, ""There, I saved you, but you didn't deserve it.""

Gary Cooper is the epitome of the noble, courageous, self-sacrificing White man who carved America out of the wilderness. In this way the movie works much better as an parable of the way present day America (the townspeople) turns its back on its heroic White traditions (Gary Cooper).",1139616000,,1316,5.0

It's about integrity, standing against evil, responsibility, and being a real hero. That this story is a Western is almost incidental. I consider it to be a classic moral story more than a classic Western, although it functions perfectly well as a Western. Marshal Will Kane certainly does not want to die or fight alone. He considers running away, more from a desire to avoid unnecessary trouble than from cowardice - though he is afraid - but he realizes that running is not a solution in this case. Kane doesn't overcome fear; he faces it. Each man in town has his own reasons for not helping Kane, displaying various aspects of passivity, apathy, fear, greed, and rationalization. The acting, setting, and dialogue are sparse but brilliant. The music helps to set the right emotional tone, and the theme song is especially evocative.

3161345,5,B0016MLIKM,"Some ""classic"" movies become such icons that everyone knows they've seen them but never watches them again because ""everybody's seen that already."" If ""High Noon"" is that kind of film for you OR if you've never managed to see it because everybody AROUND you has that impression, here is a great way to reaquaint yourself with a classic that is not only a barrier-breaking western, it's also a film classic regardless of genre and worthy of the term.

Aside from the story of duty and how Gary Cooper's lawman feels obligated to stand up to the criminal who's coming to gun him down on the noon train (hence the title) the whole subtext of standing against prevailing opinion, germane in the McCarthy-ite 50's when this film was made, makes overall impressions beyond the plot itself. The vision of beauty that is the young Grace Kelly as his new Quaker/pacifist wife only adds to the enjoyment as do performances by supporting players like Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado and the later-to-be-made-famous-by-Spaghetti-westerns Lee Van Cleef as one of the badguy's henchmen.

This restored and picture perfect edition also includes a short but interesting documentary on the making of the film hosted by movie historain Leonard Maltin that interviews most of the people involved in the film, and a SECOND little special feature talks with the surviving children of Cooper, Kelly, the director, producer, and other principal participants, including the late John Riter, son of singing cowboy star Tex Ritter who made a hit of the theme song---and WOW does GARY COOPER's daughter look, talk, and even move like him!

Another interesting point made by the documentaries--""High Noon"" was perhaps the first film ever made to use the technique of ""real time""--it is almost exactly in synch with the actual minutes clicking down towards Noon and the many clocks in the film used to heighten the suspense are all in synch with each other--kind of a 1950's Western version of the modern TV hit ""24"" and unique for its time that way.

""High Noon"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies and westerns ever made for a reason. In case you forgot, or never knew, why, this version is the one to get and, I'm sure, watch over and over through the years.",1127520000,,2241,4.858638743455497

3161347,3,B0016MLIKM,"First -- the film itself is a classic and justly deserves a five-star rating.  This particular DVD release, however, may be a bit disappointing for some.  The ""collector's edition"" features some film commentary and behind-the-scenes discussion, but almost all of it is focused on drawing parallels between the film's storyline and the hearings on Un-American acitivities that occurred about the same time the movie was made.

While some comparison between the two is legitimate, the feature-length commentary virtually ignores other allegorical interpretations.  What makes ""High Noon"" a classic is that, besides simply being a story about duty and integrity when the chips are down, it can represent different things to different people.

If one is hell-bent on viewing it allegorically, one can find it representative of World War II, the Cold War, the war on terrorism, a conflict between the domestic and the foreign, a struggle for gender or racial equality, etc. etc.  Heaven forbid one should simply like it as a story of a good guy whippin' the bad guys.

But to view its symbolism only within the confines of a parable about internecine politics is narrow-minded and diminishes its status as a classic work of photographic, dramatic, and narrative art.  Very little is said of these aspects of the film in the course of the commentary; the conversation always comes back to the Hollywood blacklist.  I would like to have learned more about how this or that technical problem was solved, and less repetitive annotation about Carl Foreman's political persecution.

So to sum up -- great movie, and no doubt many will be delighted with this release, but the collector's edition may not be for everybody.  A no-frills version may work just as well.",1124668800,,1753,5.094405594405594

I don't know what's worse, the fact that certain shots are remade almost perfectly from the old movie, or the fact that almost the first twenty minutes are devoted to characters explaining to each other things which were obvious to the viewer in the first movie, without the characters stopping to tell each other how they felt.

The film opens with three men riding on horses together confidantly and with a purpose that isn't immediately apparent.  You start to think that this is going to be a good shoot em up film.  That mislead is a great thing that this film gets right.  To the person seeing it a second time (and hopefully not reading this review first) it dramatizes the incoming story well.  What you end up getting is a story about what is necessary to provoke action and whether ideals and quality of life are things worthy to fight for, whether fighting is necessary at all.  To a certain extent, the film becomes increasingly dry leading up to the ending, but I don't think the portions that take their time are bad in any way, they seem very real.  These portions are why people think this film is crap today, but back then the film came out around the time of the red scare and a number of people involved in the film were blacklisted.  The film also presents a hero who has to ask for help and doesn't really get any.  This flies in the face of all the Western fantasy of what a hero is like.  In the common Western the hero inspires by example, doesn't have to ask, always comes out on top, never breaks a sweat, and is always believed by the common folk in the film to be in the right.  ""High Noon"" is what is referred to as a revisionist western and John Wayne with his director friend Howard Hawks took the same idea and changed around the results creating the epic  ""Rio Bravo."" To restate the differences between the two films, this film is not an epic, but a story about underlying questions of principle in everyday life.  I imagine what most people disliked about this film was that it's a critique of society and presents all parties involved in a less than sterling light.  To me, the movie stands the test of time well because it's smart, it sticks to certain motif's throughout (the sense of dread through clocks), the opposition of the main character by his wife who's a Quaker.  Also, it separates itself from being a formulaic western thriller by not constantly keeping the water boiling and giving the audience time to consider the underlying principles and rationally judge the situation, just like the hero.  Interestingly, the film ends with the hero coming out on top, but it's not a positive thing here, it's almost an afterthought.  So, in summary, this is not an action western, it's a ponderous one, so if that's what you want, well you can rent/buy ""Rio Bravo.""  Although they are ideologically opposed they are both good movies in their own rights, although I think this one is superior on an intellectual basis.",1113350400,,2706,4.532921810699588
3161373,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly are spectacular in what is considered one of the best westerns ever made, but should be ranked as one of the greatest films ever produced because it easily transcends its genre.

A morality play that was deliberately produced in stark black-and-white to heighten the mood, the story revolves around Cooper's character, the aging Marshal of Hadleyville who, when the film begins, weds Kelly's character. Cooper has retired and plans to return after his honeymoon as a store keeper because his wife is a Quaker and a pacifist. Plans immediately go awry, however, when it is discovered that a notorious killer whom Cooper had arrested and was expected to have been executed, was instead pardoned. The killer is expected to arrive back in town on the noon train to take revenge on Cooper. Three of his equally savage gang have already arrived and are waiting for him at the train station.

The townspeople urge Cooper to flee with his new wife, but as he starts out of town, he stops, then returns, convinced that he has a responsibility to protect the town and bring the outlaws to justice. Pinning the marshal's badge back on, Cooper tries to deputize residents, but no one will help him and he is forced to stand alone. In powerful scenes, Cooper is forced to ask for help time-after-time but is turned down by residents who refuse to accept civic responsibility or acknowledge the debt they owe Cooper, rationalizing their decision not to act.

Kelly doesn't understand her new husband and threatens to leave on the same noon train if he persists in remaining as the marshall this one last time. Kelly eventually begins to understand what drives Cooper but only after forming an unlikely friendship with his former girlfriend, who teaches Kelly about loyalty and character. Ironically, it is Kelly the pacifist who saves Cooper's life by picking up a .45 and killing one of the gunmen.

In the last scene, the steets are utterly deserted until the gunmen are killed, then the townspeople, who had been hiding, flock around Cooper and Kelly. Without a word, Cooper removes his badge and drops it in the dirt. He and Kelly leave together.

Throughout the movie, the stirring music and the real-time focus of the minutes ticking by until High Noon, serve to increase the movie's tension. The film combines elements of love, trust, duty, honor and courage in unexpected ways that are both thought-provoking and entertaining.

3161375,3,B0016MLIKM,"The House Committee on Un-Amewrican Activities (HUAC) was created in 1938 as a means to investigate people suspected of Communism and supporting Communism. Its first major attack was on the Hollywood film industry. Blacklisting of Hollywood writers, actors, producers, directors, and others suspected of Communist affiliations began with the committee's hearings in October 1947 and flourished throughout the 1950's, a period known as the Red Scare. Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted ""witch hunts"" in an attempt to find and eliminate suspected Communists. The Committee began its hearing with ""friendly witnesses"" who shared the opinions of the HUAC. Each witness provided answers the Committee wanted to hear in order to set the tone for later witnesses who might resist giving information. The ""unfriendly"" witnesses became known as The Hollywood Ten, who were cited for contempt of Congress and jailed for failure to cooperate with the House Committee.

HIGH NOON has been called a parable for the situation of those Americans who stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Investigating Committee and to the House of UnAmerican Activities Commitee during the Red Scare. It became an American classic, not only for its stylistic innovations, but also as an allegory to the McCarthy era. HIGH NOON is said to have reformultated the traditional Western and became a successful box-office surprise, breaking house records.

The movie takes place within the course of a few hours, in the small town of Hadleyville, New Mexico, as Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is being wed to his beautiful young bride, Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly). The entire town has turned out for the event, that is, until news arrives that a band of ex-cons working for convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) have returned to settle a score with Kane after their arrests under his law landed them in prison.

The script was written by Carl Foreman, who was blacklisted as a result of the Red Scare. It is said that Foreman's Blacklisting and his betrayal at the hands of his colleagues defined and shaped the motion picture. What should have been the high point of Foreman's career was nothing more than a lonely exile for him. Shut away from family and friends, Foreman was excluded from most of the production on HIGH NOON and faced serious bouts with depression. His old partner, Stanley Kramer, betrayed him by severing their business ties and removing his credit as producer of the film, due to the Blacklist, instead of helping his friend fight. To look at the script, its characters, and its situations, is to realize the resemblance of the situation to the plight of those who populate the film itself.

Consider Cooper's Kane, for example. His desperation quickly grows when it becomes clear that no one in the town is willing to take a stand by his side once noon arrives. In less than two hours, he's gone from being commended and applauded at his wedding to being the center of attention as the cause of the town's tensions and dangers, all because of doing his everyday work. Whether or not screenwriter Foreman was intentionally trying to reveal something about our society at this period in time is uncertain, but the film definitely mirrors his own predicament and the betrayal he felt.

Throughout the duration of the film, which takes place in real time, Foreman and director Fred Zinnemann also examine the effects of the impending danger on certain members of the townsfolk. The film's elements of loyalty, betrayal, trust and mistrust, are all factors that came into play during McCarthyism, and tie in brilliantly with reality. Kane's bride, Amy, is torn between her fear of violence and bloodshed and her devotion to her husband, while many of the townsfolk grapple with the choice of standing behind their Marshall or finding an excuse to hide, as seen in an interrupted church service, where a pleading Kane is shot down by his own citizens. These are people struck by fear, and out of that fear they are willing to leave Kane to fend for himself.

HIGH NOON is about loyalty and betrayal. Loyalty on Kane's part - even when everyone deserts him, he stands his ground, though it seems inevitable that the action will cost him his life. And betrayal on the town's part. Many of the locals are agreed that they owe their prosperity to Kane, but they will not help him or defend him, because they believe his cause to be hopeless. In the end, Kane is forced into the showdown on his own, until, at a crucial moment, Amy proves herself to be a worthy wife, fighting to protect her husband.

Without support from the townsfolk, Kane will no longer be their leader. Silently, without a backward glance or goodbye, he and Amy ride off into the distance from the community of weak, fickle onlookers. The contemptible crowd that was unwilling to fight to preserve its law and order remains silent as the buckboard goes out of view, accompanied by the title song's famous melancholy ballad. A parallel to other ""hostile witnesses"" who wound up abandoning their careers? Perhaps.",1112140800,,5079,4.954225352112676

Why they thought that the filmmakers' kids would have anything to offer is baffling. They should have gotten a critic or film historian or someone who actually had something relevant to say (apart from the usual complaints about the Evil Senator McCarthy).

3161389,2,B0016MLIKM,"When commie Carl Foreman wrote this, he was following in the footsteps of his fellow Communists in blurring, blending, twisting and ultimately distorting the age old story of good vs. evil. Many of the reviews of this movie over the decades have said that this movie was a way for Foreman to portray himself vicariously as Cooper in standing up for what is right when he lied before the House Un-American Committee about his Communist ties. His testimony occurred long before Senator Joe McCarthy showed up, but this film is somehow an attack on ""McCarthyism"" and McCarthy, who never served in the House of Representatives or on HUAC. It is a classic example of how the communists were so successful in infiltrating the US opinion makers. The recent revelations of the KGB have shown that McCarthy was essentially correct, and that Communists in the USA took their orders from Moscow during the Cold War.

The good part of the movie is that the USA has historically had men and women who have stood up for what is morally right. The bad part of this movie is that the extraordinary country that the USA is had been co-opted in many ways by a very smart and very smarmy Communist like Foreman, who steals the ideal, and like the rat that he was, contaminates it to make it something closer to his goal of using good motives for evil purposes. Try to find a movie that exposes the fact that Stalin murdered millions more than Hitler in his evil program to advance communism. You won't find one because the ethos of Hollywood is still steeped in the tradition of supporting communism as these multi-millionaires have their chauffeurs drive them to the studio from their seaside mansions in Malibu or Beverly Hills.

Cooper is great in this movie, but it is defiled by the legacy that its author was yet another commie agent who viewed the masses as stupid and easily subject to manipulation. Kind of like a Cold War Moore. Unfortunately he was very right in this regard as proven by many who view this movie as a triumph of attacking a Senator who has been shown much more correct than wrong. Sad thing about the end of the Cold War. When it ended, the rocks got picked up and the roaches had nowhere to hide. And Foreman would have been left exposed to explain himself if he had still been alive when real freedom triumphed over the evil he supported all of his life.",1104796800,,2365,4.588652482269503

3161393,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is the film that has been screened most often at the White House for the President of the United States.  Given that this is the story of a man who stands up to considerable opposition to do the right thing, even when he is abandoned by everyone who should be rushing to his side, the idea that this is a perennial Presidential favorite is rather reassuring (as opposed to the legend of Richard Nixon watching ""Patton"" before deciding to invade Cambodia).  You can imagine that ""High Noon"" has been screened at the White House once or twice in the last three years.

Regardless of any impact on America's political and military history, ""High Noon"" is a seminal film in the genre of Western movies.  Until 1952 Hollywood was producing what we would know call the traditional western, where the good guy in the white hat defeats the bad guy in the black hat.  In this format we not only followed the adventures of the Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, and Hopalopng Cassidy, but we also knew the names of their horses (Silver, Trigger, and Topper, respectively).  However, with ""High Noon"" (and ""Shane"" the following year), we had the creation of the Adult Western, which introduced the notion of moral doubt and had a hero that was going to end up kissing a woman rather than his horse.  In these westerns the hero remains the moral leader of the community, but now he can make mistakes, although they are rarely fatal errors.  Ironically, the hero's flawed character actually makes him even more heroic, because he has to struggle against himself as well as against the bad guys.

Director Fred Zinnemann's film contains the same elements as the Traditional Western, but with significant differences.  Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is the moral lawman who protects the town of Hadleyville, but he is about to marry Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who insists that he give up his job as the marshal of his western town.  There is the big gunfight with the bad guys, but it takes place at the climax of the film.  Except for one brief fistfight, this is much more of a psychological drama than an action film until the final scene.  But the suspense of the film, especially as the clock is ticking down to twelve, becomes quite intense, helped by Elmo Williams' editing.  There is a sense in which the final gunfight is almost anti-climatic, because whether Will Kane lives or dies he has made his main point. But the gunfight is also subversively different, because it is not played out in the main street of town but in the barns and back alleys, more like guerilla warfare than the traditional mano-e-mano contest.

Less than two hours after the wedding, convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is arriving on the noon train.  Miller is coming to town to kill Kane, the man who sent him to prison, and a trio of his henchmen are waiting for their boss at the station.  Everyone in town, the mayor (Thomas Mitchell), the judge (Otto Kurger), and even the former marshal (Lon Chaney), all want Kane to run away.  His deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him and even when Kane goes to a church to ask for help he is turned down.  His new wife will leave him and he will have to stand by himself against Miller and his gang, but Kane cannot run away.  The quintessential camera shot in ""High Noon"" is when Kane is standing alone in the street.  Cinematographer Floyd Crosby (who had won an Oscar in 1931 for ""Tabu""), begins with a close up of Kane, sweat streaming down his face, and his hand shaking; then the camera pulls back on a crane shot to show the marshal standing all alone in the deserted street of his town.

Cooper deservedly won his second Oscar for this role and the fact that it Gary Cooper that was up there on the silver screen showing that he was afraid made all the difference in the world.  Will Kane was afraid, but he went ahead and did his job.  For audiences raised on westerns up to that time it was a shocking idea, although those who had fought in World War II could probably identify with the notion.  ""High Noon"" redefines the notion of heroism in an important way.  A man can be afraid, and still act bravely.  It is, in simple terms, a more adult conception of heroism.  This movie is also the ""24"" of its time, taking place pretty much in real time.  The wedding happens after 10 and all the clocks we see throughout the film ticking down to noon are in the ballpark, although I admit I have never timed them.  This is just a landmark film on so many levels.  For example, ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh, My Darlin'"" was the first song from a non-musical film to ever win the Oscar for Best Original Song.

There are lots of stories that have sprung up about ""High Noon.""  There are those who read ""High Noon"" as an allegory regarding those who stood up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era and refused to cooperate with their blacklisting efforts.  Screenwriter Carl Foreman, cinematographer Floyd Crosby, and actor Lloyd Bridges were all blacklisted shortly after this film came out, which gives credence to the allegory idea although it would constitute more of a prediction.  Then there is the story that John Wayne declared the film to be ""Un-American,"" but then he picked up Cooper's Oscar for him at the Academy Awards the next year and apparently complained that he had not been offered the part (which actually had been offered to Gregory Peck first).  I am not sure that Wayne could have pulled it off, though it would have been interesting to see him try.  Jimmy Stewart did a similar role opposite the Duke in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.""",1100217600,,5616,4.591182364729459

To say the truth,  ""High noon"" is more like a thriller with a Hitchcockian feeling to it.

What makes this movie great is the seemingly dead-end situation, the great dialogues, and very good acting by Gary Cooper (which earned him an Oscar, when the Academy Awards were not given for political reasons), Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, among others (and Lee Van Cleef, the infamous ""Angel Eyes"" from ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" - he doesn't say a word, but those eyes are surely creepy).
I will not give ""High noon"" five stars because I felt the script could be a little more developed. The ending is too rushed and kind of unsatisfying. But this is an excellent movie nonetheless. And, I say it again, this is not a ""western"" in the common sense of the genre.

It is primarily a psychological western, not the shoot um ups that reigned in the past. What makes high noon such a masterpiece is the incredible perfection of its craft. It is truly one of the most tightly constructed films ever made. Not a single frame is wasted in the telling of its story and its conveying of mood. The film should be mandatory viewing for budding filmmakers, so they can learn the importance of lean, fat free editing. Kurosawa said he only shot footage so he could edit and high noon is truly a brilliant example of the power of concise editing. Many films today love to draw out their endings with multiple resolutions, high noon proves the power of speed and simplicity in its powerful closing scene.
The high noon dvd is presented in full frame format since the film was not shot in widescreen. Picture is amazing for a film that is over 50 years old. Contrast and sharpness are gorgeous and the print is one of the best of a film of this age. Sharpness is truly stunning. Shimmering and flicker is present on some objects and there are occasional tiny spots on the image. The spots were so small and infrequent i didn't even notice them ever until a second viewing. Shimmering on trees is present quite a bit especially if you have a cheaper dvd player. These are minor points, because i was stunned at the beauty of the tranfer.
Sound is presented in regular and enchanced audio. Regular sometimes has cooper's dialogue a little low. Enchanced has more kick, but they may have toyed with the original mix. A commentary is including with relatives of the cast and crew. I didn't listen to all of it, it is presented in a group conversational manner.
Extras are interesting with a informative leonard maltin backstory on the film. I'm not a maltin fan and find his narration annoying, but he points out intriguing notes on the film's production. The best part is oncamera interviews from several years ago with zinneman and other real cast/crew member. Zinneman tells a great story about how the train ran over the camera when they were shooting the railroad track shots.

Directed by Fred Zinneman, whose credits include From Here to Eternity (1953), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Julia (1977) and a dozen more, High Noon tells the story of Will Kane, a small town marshal who, on his wedding day faces a man just let out of prison with three of his outlaw friends who are aiming to get revenge for his being sent up.

The enduring image of the film is Gary Cooper walking tall in the deserted streets of the town in a black Western hat, a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt, black string necktie, watch chain, boots, and low slung holster and two belts, while off to the side inside the wooden buildings we see ""that big hand move along, nearin' high noon""--which is when the train arrives carrying the freed prisoner.

Will Kane has cleaned up the town, but now the gunslingers return and he is their target.  His wife of less than an hour (Kelly) demands that he leave town.  The town itself, in fear of the gunmen, also wants him to leave town, hoping to take the fight away from them.  He tries to recruit deputies but everyone is afraid.  Even his lone deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him.  In the background is Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting ballad, sung by Tex Ritter: ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling (On This Our Wedding Day).""  Both Cooper and the song won Oscars.  Noteworthy was the fine performance by Kay Jurado as ... Ramirez, Cane's ex, a shrewd barroom lady and proprietress.

What is interesting about the moral conflict (from the story, ""The Tin Star"" as interpreted for film by screenwriter Carl Foreman), that of facing your enemy rather than running, is that Kane's rationale is logical.  If he runs they will only come after him again and again.  Only two people get this, Kane and Ramirez.  The larger moral issue of whether to fight to defend yourself (Grace Kelly is cast as a Quaker and does not believe in killing) is resolved during the climatic shootout by Grace Kelly's character herself in a manner that did not set well with Quakers.

How well does this black and white classic Western play today?  The town people seem cliches and the outlaws are quickly drawn, but Gary Cooper as Will Kane seems entirely believable, admirable, heroic in the best sense of the term as a man who knows the dangers, feels the fear, and yet must act, and he does.  He is no shallow, two-fisted, machine-gun hero so often seen in Hollywood productions, but a man of maturity whose ""grace under pressure"" (a fine definition of courage) tells us and himself who he really is.

See this for Gary Cooper whose ""slow-talking, slow-walking,"" (lyrics from the Coaster's hit song from the fifties, ""And Along Came Jones""), and soft-spoken heroics delighted and enthralled a couple of generations of film-goers.",1075939200,,3164,4.728597449908925

3161415,5,B0016MLIKM,"I saw this at age 8 when it was a brand-new, my-gosh piece of controversy.  In fact, I saw it six times and the house was packed at each showing.  Many powerful images have stayed in my head since then, and they are just as impressive today.  Recall that the ""controversy"" behind this classic was its timing at the height of McCarthy's Red scare; the writers and directors, their creativity stymied by myopic thinking and fears of the day, pulled quite a stunt; the hero Will Kane marches to a different drummer in the face of a skittish and conformist environment.  Politics aside, of course, this is just a rattling good movie.  It started a new trend, which in those days was referred to as the ""adult"" Western, which in turn meant it dealt with ideas, principles, real-world emotions, not just horses and guns.  Take it as an allegory of 50's culture or as a great Western, it works either way.  Even its presentation style was a rule-breaker: starts with Tex Ritter droning ""Do Not Forsake Me O My Darlin'"" in the background, after which every Hollywood Western had to have a Western singer in the credits (unfortunately, it was usually a near-screaming, echo-chambered Frankie Lane with a blaring symphony orchestra backup! Good grief).  The 1952 masterpiece was followed by countless imitations -- and how many Eastwood movies feature High Noon-style confrontations ?  It's a landmark film so well done, it defies imitation.  The DVD print is quite good, but the ""digitized"" sound is awful, as usual (turn it off, play it in the original mono).  Catch the fight scene with Cooper and Bridges, and the scenes with skillful Katy Jurado and her competing suitors; it doesn't get any more real than this, and veteran director Zinnemann outdoes himself here.  Every performance is tight and right-on.  And note: the action occurs in real time.  You can synchronize your wrist watch to the brief glances at the clocks on the walls.  And dig that camera work; black and white was an art in those days, and has become a lost art since.  A stirring, original, and unique work in every way.  Some good features on the Collectors Edition.",1074038400,,2134,4.771117166212534
3161416,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a very difficult film to review, most of us have seen it, and likely more than once.  The best thing to try and do here is justifying the purchase.  For one thing it's a clean digitized version from the original negative.  Not all DVDs are, many to the regret of buyers.  It has a lot of extra's, interviews and making of specials.  It's often fun to watch a good film again, after we know all the ""inside stuff"".
What makes this film so watchable for repeat viewings?  This movie plays to our emotions, on so many different levels.  It's reaffirmation of a man, doing his duty as a man.  Much like the patriot, who fights for God and country! To watch it again, is to once again reaffirm your own manliness and resolve.  It's a study of different male natures, and raw motivations. Those who would join the fight if they were to benefit.  Friends, who are there for you until circumstances look a bit too dire.  The nave young boy, who would enter the fight without knowing the consequences. To the political arm of the town who tried to convince Kane to run, knowing the trouble would likely follow him, and pass them by.
The women in the story are just as interesting.  You have the Pure young Quaker wife, (who's religious convictions would normally preclude violence of any kind) reluctantly coming to grips with reality of the situation.  You have the scarlet woman, who recognizes the rare value of Kane's heroic nature. They've had an obvious relationship in the past, but likely she could never meet him on equal grounds of morality. The wives who hide out in the church, and help squelch any male support from the townsmen.  Their motivation is simple enough, they know someone will likely get shot, and they'd rather their men did not participate.
This particular edition is not released yet as I write this, so I haven't confirmed this.  I do believe one of the commentaries (some which have aired on TV before) mentions the unlikely case this could have happened at the time presented in the film.  If I recall, they explained that most towns of this type were full of ex-civil war vets, who would have had no qualms what-so-ever about taking up guns, to help the Marshall. This may be true, but it's not the point of the film.  In the end, Kane drops his tin star in the dirt, and appears to turn his back on the town in disgust.  I had some thoughts about that, but always believed that his disgust was not over the betrayal of the town.  I thought he believed that the town betrayed themselves, and was disgusted with the thought of it.
I did wonder one more thing at the end of the movie.  Since Kane's' wife jumped off the train, just as it was leaving the station, how did she get all her luggage back, and loaded up in that wagon right after the gunfight?  The airlines could use baggage handlers that good!",1073174400,,2835,4.487329434697855
3161437,5,B0016MLIKM,"One of my favorite movies of all time is this suspenseful Western starring Gary Cooper.  It is a simple tale told in a complex and artistic manner.  A man retires as the town Marshall and marries a Quaker (the main reason for his retirement).  On the day of their wedding, word comes that a man he sent away to prison (Frank Miller) has been released and is heading to his town to settle the score.  The ex-Marshall, Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), first leaves with his new bride but turns around to meet the challenge.  He initially assumes that he will not have to meet Frank Miller alone.  However, when he looks to put together some deputies, only one man volunteers and once that man realizes that he is the only volunteer, he quits as well.  Knowing that Frank Miller will be accompanied by two henchmen, Kane is face with the reality that he will have to face the challenge alone and out-gunned.  The stage is thus set for a suspenseful gun battle.
Naturally, good triumphs over evil; this is a 1952 movie afterall.  However, the movie shows that not all is well within what we consider to represent good.  Why was Kane left to meet this fight alone?  Even his newlywed bride gave him an ultimatim of her of the shootout.  This concept of one man standing alone amidst cowardice and apathy angered the likes of John Ford and John Wayne (although it didn't keep the Duke from accepting Cooper's Best Actor Oscar on his behalf).  World War II was still vivid in everyone's memory and it was a memory of America coming to the rescue; not kicking and screaming but marching proudly.  Yet this movie was not an analogy of WWII but of the McCarthy Era where the suggestion was that fear intimidated the populace and kept them from speaking up when individuals were challenged.
Irregardless of your thoughts on the film's deeper meaning, this is a tour-de-force by Cooper. His stoic strength in the face of fear is a preformance for the ages.  Cooper does not come across as a man full of himself.  He shows that he has weaknesses but he struggles, successfully, to confront them.  He is Everyman who must face his fears, not some Superman who has no fear.  The movie builds in suspense as he becomes increasingly aware of his lonely mission.  Then the suspense jump-starts to a higher level as everything awaits the arrival of Frank Miller on the noon train.  I can hear the music of the soundtrack accentuate the suspense and the train whistle blowing the arrival of Fate.  The shoot out itself is subdued somewhat in scope reminding us that it is Everyman and not Superman who is battling the enemy.  The final scene is as dramatic in symbolism as the shoot-out was in action.
As time, tastes, an technology move on, many once-great movies fall by the wayside.  ""High Noon"" is a movie for all ages and all times.  The acting, directing, musical score, supporting acting, writing et. al. are all superb.  If you haven't scene this movie, you're missing a classic.  Watch it and understand the art of movie-making in the days before Spielberg.",1069891200,,3048,4.618959107806692
3161438,4,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is considered one of the best westerns ever made, there are many reasons why this movie is so appealing. The first thing that the audience notices is the great cast, everybody did a great job, there isn't a single weak performance. ""High Noon"" has 2 superstars from that decade: Gary Cooper & Grace Kelly.

 The plot of the movie is very good and interesting, and as the film moves forward it gets more and more interesting. By the way, ""High Noon"" was filmed in ""real time"", because everything happens according to the time in the watch.

 During the last 25 minutes of the movie, the suspense grows increasingly until the movie reaches the climax, so the film gets better every minute. For these and other reasons, ""High Noon"" is a classic that must be seen, it's one of the most popular westerns ever made.",1067126400,,821,4.602739726027397

3161440,5,B0016MLIKM,"Tex Ritter's Oscar-winning theme song is heard throughout reflecting the abandonment Marshal Will Kane feels when the town of Hadleyville refuses to help him face down some gunmen itching for revenge.  The aerial shot of him standing alone in the streets of Hadleyville exemplifies the struggle he faces.
Thing is, he didn't have to go back.  He just got married to Amy, a nice Quaker woman, handed in his badge on his retirement day, and was about to embark on a new life until he gets word that three gunmen are awaiting the noon train bringing home Frank Miller, an outlaw Kane once arrested and sent to prison, now released.  However, Kane feels a burning responsibility to face them, and he returns, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One, even if he did flee, they would track him down, being the vindictive men they are.  Two, Kane's replacement won't arrive until tomorrow, and he doesn't want even a ""dirty little village in the middle of nowhere"" to become embroiled in chaos for even one day under Miller.
However, not a finger is lifted to help him.  Harvey, a deputy sheriff, is sore at Kane for not being selected as the latter's replacement.  Others are friends of Miller.  Most of the time, they acknowledge the great service Kane has done for them as marshal, but at the same time, they say he was stupid for coming back, thinking that it would be the new marshal's responsibility to handle Miller and his thugs.  They're also scared <rhymes with witless> as well.
That brings open the question of responsibility.  The citizens of Hadleyville bicker about whether it's the local government or the state government that's responsible for stopping criminals.  And if no one is willing to do so due to cowardice or denial, who else will?  Kane thus seems to be the only person willing to take that burden.  As Helen Ramirez, a former flame of Kane, points out, ""When he dies, this town will die too.""  Despite her heart of steel, she does show some support for Kane in the end.
Then there's the issue of pacifism versus self-defense.  It brings the question, when is it right to resort to violence?  When one is attacked?  When you see someone being attacked?  Also, the complaint that the judges and juries set free criminals captured by lawmen still rings true today.
Gary Cooper deservedly won the Best Actor statue for his role as Will Kane.  And I'm not exactly a big fan of Grace Kelly but she did remarkably well in her first starring role.  Maybe it's because she played a Quaker and I lean towards non-violence, or that line of hers on guns:  ""I don't care who's right or who's wrong.  There's got to be some better way for people to live.""
 Given his resemblance to a certain contemporary White House occupant, Lloyd Bridges's portrayal of Harvey made me cringe somewhat.  However, Katy Jurado as the resolute, steel-hearted Helen Ramirez gets honours as a fiercely independent woman who has to struggle with being a Mexican amid whites and a business owner as well.
Many of the other supporting cast are worth mentioning.  Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin, Will's old mentor is one.  Harry Morgan, later to become Colonel Potter in MASH, has a small role as Sam Fuller.
I also had fun keeping track of the time on the various clocks, be it the courthouse, barber shop, or Helen's room.  Obviously, all three don't tell the exact same time, but I kept time there was a ten-minute discrepancy on my clock from the time in the courthouse, 10:40 AM, to noon.  I usually never watch Westerns anymore, but this classic was a rare exception to the rule.",1061424000,,3562,4.656
3161441,5,B0016MLIKM,"By now, other reviewers have said all there is to say about the plotline and virtually everything else concerning this movie.  I'll simply add a personal experience in support of my vote that this is probably the best film of all time.
I first saw the film with my parents at a drive in.  I was six.  That was 50 years ago. I was fascinated by the movie and the music at the time and remain so to this day.
I make it a point to watch High Noon again at least once a year and never tire of it.  If anything, it gets better with repeated viewing.  Repeated viewing provides an appreciation of the lesser things that help make this such a masterpiece--the great job the supporting actors did, the use of the music, the clock, the chair, etc. to build the tension until it becomes almost unbearable by the time the first whistle of the noon train sounds.
One of my favorite scenes--In a role often overlooked, Katy Jurado as Helen Ramirez telling Harve, played by Lloyd Bridges, ""You are a nice looking boy, Harve.  You have beeg, strong shoulders.  But it takes more than beeg, strong shoulders to make a man.  Will Kane is a man.""  Wow! Every line, every glance, every moment of this film is exceptional.
At that first viewing 50 years ago, when the moment came when Kane fingers his badge and looks at the approaching townspeople, my quiet, proper mother blurted loudly at the screen, ""Throw it down in the dirt!""  You had to know my mother, but a film which could get her to do that is truly powerful.
Has the film aged well?  Allow me to offer as evidence that it has, the repeated references to it by none other than Tony Soprano in HBO's The Sopranos.  ""Whateva happened to Gary Coopa?  The strong, quiet type.  Just do what hadda be done.""  The first time Tony makes this statement, you think he means Gary Cooper the actor in his common quiet, but strong roles. By season four, however, Tony adds to his repeated, ""Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?"" line, ""He faced down the Miller gang when none of those blankety blanks from town would help him.""  You realize then that Tony means, not Gary Cooper, but Will Kane in High Noon.  Now, that's an enduring legacy for a great, great film!",1059609600,,2190,4.435

3161443,5,B0016MLIKM,"In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserves the last and worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. I thought about that when recently seeing this film again. In brief, here's the situation. Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) learns that Frank Miller has been released from prison and will arrive on the noon train when it stops in Hadleyville. Joined by others, Miller then intends to locate the marshall and kill him. For various reasons, everyone in town abandons Kane...including his newlywed wife Amy (Kelly) and his deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges). Of course, Kane is tempted to leave with his new bride before noon and avoid Miller...but he doesn't. As high noon approaches, he finds himself alone and facing almost certain death. Cooper received and deserved his Academy Award for best actor. His performance in this film may well have been the best in his entire career. Especially effective use is made of the theme song ""Do Not Forsake Me [The Ballad of High Noon]"" co-written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington (sung off-camera by Tex Ritter), the key component of Tiomkin's music score which received an Academy Award. The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Bridges, Katy Jurado (Helen Ramirez), and Lon Chaney, Jr. (Martin Howe). Working with Carl Foreman's screenplay, director Fred Zinnemann focuses on what was (more than 50 years ago) a very controversial idea: that otherwise good people would refuse to support their marshal when he and their town are threatened by cold-blooded killers. John Wayne was among those who called this film ""Un-American."" Several of the townspeople can be accused of cowardice but that is not true of Amy Kane, a pacifist whose principles require her to oppose her husband's decision to remain. The final scene in the street is unforgettable. Whatever we may think, today, of Kane's decision and of those who oppose it or who remain neutral, we can nonetheless agree that this film still attracts and then sustains our interest; also, that our sense of dramatic tension increases with each passing moment.",1058745600,,2088,5.0726744186046515

About to retire and move away from Hadleyville, Kane marries Amy, a Quaker(Grace Kelly plays the part of Kane's new bride). But before he can leave, he learns that Frank Miller, a wild gunman and murderer, has been released from prison. Miller vowed that he would return to Hadleyville one day and that he would kill Kane for sending him to prison. As Kane gets ready to leave, he learns that Miller's old gang is waiting at the train station, where Miller is due at noon.

Rather than run, Kane decides to stay. This infuriates Amy, who fears that she'll be a widow before the day is out. Her Quaker religion  forbids her to use violence as a means to settle disputes.

Kane searches the town for deputies to help him put a stop to Miller. But no one will help. Kane is alone. Even Amy says she's leaving on the train that will bring Miller to Hadleyville. What will Kane do?

Throughout this film, shot in gritty black and white, Tex Ritter's haunting ""Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darling"" plays in the background, adding to the ever-present drama and tension.",1054684800,,1207,4.518348623853211
3161447,4,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper was at his career best in quietly defining the emotional turmoil of an honorable lawman who finds little encouragment and support from the very people he has selflessly served for years. Though off the professional hook because of his newly-wed status and a new life in a world away from law enforcement, Will Kane could not easily avoid taking on armed responsibility one last time.
""High Noon"" perfectly defined timeless if unpleasant elements of human behavior that can at times infuriate, confuse, frustrate,  and even sabotage the best of honorable intentions. When people herd, they can always find a way of rationalizing aversion to getting involved for the greater good and can become quite clever in explaining away personal cowardice. As the noon hour drew closer, Kane finally sought out the help of his long time mentor and retired fellow lawman who succinctly noted that ""deep down, people don't care, they just don't care."" Anyway, age and arthritic hands made his armed support a moot point.
This film is a relevant today as when released just over 50 years ago.  In some ways, even more so.  Few films capture so elegantly what it is to find ones self in dire circumstances so utterly alone.
Facing such a defining moment takes an uncommon courage and a real character to fight long odds of probable defeat.  Not much is so really different in today's politically charged climate, not really.  Will Kane's strength and courage of conviction will never go out of style, but alas, will always be  in short supply.",1050537600,,1539,4.9
3161448,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" surprised me with its quality.  I was expecting a good Western, but I was not expecting a multi-layered, metaphorical and psychological drama.  This is genre storytelling at its finest, using the setting of a Western to tell a more far-reaching story.
Short, ringing in at only 84 minutes, ""High Noon"" manages to capture a complete tale in glances, unspoken dialog, gestures and implied content.  Filmed in real time, there is a tense urgency as well as a melancholy finality.  The clock ticks towards high noon, and nothing will stop it.
Gary Cooper is excellent as a retiring hero, past his prime but still willing to stand up for his principles.  He is a living example of the saying ""better to light a single candle than to curse the darkness.""  He risks everything to light his candle.  Grace Kelley is just beautiful.  Katy Jurado is a smoldering woman.

It did, however, win best actor, editing, score, and original song (""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"")

3161451,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is a classic tale of a man who is torn between his duty and love.  Gary Cooper stars as Will Cain, a sheriff of small town Hadleyville, NM, who has just gotten married to Amy played by Grace Kelly.  Amy is a Quaker and in deference to her pacifist beliefs, Will is turning in his badge.  But just as the newlyweds are preparing to leave town for a new life, Will learns that a criminal, Frank Miller, he put behind bars is being paroled and arriving in town on the 12 noon train for a showdown.

The film is just a little over 80 minutes long and it unfolds in essentially real time on the screen.  Director Fred Zinnemann effectively uses clocks to convey the time ticking away towards the battle.  The movie is filled with tension as the showdown draws near and Mr. Cooper brilliantly plays his part for which he won his second Best Actor Oscar.  Tex Ritter, John's father, sings the Oscar winning song, ""Don't Forsake Me"" which perfectly captures the essence of the film.

3161452,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a truly great film, to say nothing of a great western. The scenario is classic. An aging lawman gets married to a sweet angelic woman and decides to give up his dangerous life chasing lawbreakers. But on the same day that he gets married and is supposed to give up his star, a man he sent up the river (and naturally vowed to kill him one day) is arriving in town on the noon train. And he ain't alone. Not a bad premise for a western. But that's just the start.
This movie also has a truly perfect cast who all give great performances. In fact, many people's carreers in movies started or were greatly furthered by this film. But great acting deserves great direction, cinematography, and editing. And that my friends, is where this movie truly shines. Practically every time you enter a room, you can see a clock on the wall, ticking away the time till noon. From the time that the Marshall enters the town the second time, everything practically unrolls in real time. And as his situation gets more and more desperate and the time of reckoning gets closer and closer, the tension is fantastic.
The music (which won a well-deserved academy award) is the icing on the cake. The movie opens with a ballad pretty much telling you the entire plot in a few verses. This song plays again and again in key sequences. This may seem redundant to some, but to me this just heightens the emotional pull. And when the marshall walks into the saloon and the same song is being played on the piano...it's just perfect. This song is the theme of the movie, and adds a great surrealistic element to an already awesome movie.
Of course this review would not be complete if I did not at least one or two words about the dvd itself. Well the sound is excellent. Crisp and clean. But the picture is amazing. This movie and the French version of Beauty and the Beast (released by the mighty Criterion) are the two finest examples of black and white picture perfection I have ever seen. The picture is so CLEAN. There are some who feel that dvds can actually surpass the quality of movies seen in a theater, dvds like this are the reason why. If you never have seen this movie before, you owe it to yourself to at least rent it on dvd. If you like the movie, then you have to have this dvd. The picture is perfection. To say nothing of the movie....",1039392000,,2337,4.399538106235566

3161455,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is a magnificent film.  It is textually rich, multi-layered, incredibly well-acted (particularly Gary Cooper,) well-directed/edited, and portrays adults rather than adolescents-with-attitude, which seems to be the hallmark of so many modern American movies. The film was written by Carl Foreman and directed by Fred Zinneman, both highly intelligent and mature individuals with something quite important to say.  That gets us to the multi-layered aspect of the film.  Yes, it is a morality play about responsibility, fear, the vagaries of duty, and society's hypocrisy/cowardice. However, it is a great movie because when you get right down to the basics, it is a compelling, character-driven drama about a man making very difficult choices under very difficult conditions.  It is particularly poignant when Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) is trying--and failing--to enlist the townspeople's help for the showdown that will occur at high noon when the train arrives carrying his mortal enemy.  Kane's feelings are complex:  scared, hurt, angry, vacillating, defiant and fatalistic.  As he walks back to his office, a group of children are playing and one boy falls against him as another boy points a wooden stick and shouts, ""Bang, bang, you're dead Will Kane.""  These children are his neighbors. He has known, and served, their parents for years.  How would you feel?  Well, unlike most movies that shy away from complex human emotions, Kane feels like most of us would feel--he feels those same complex emotions I mentioned above--and so does the viewer.

3161477,4,B0016MLIKM,"Some have stated that the transfer of ""High Noon"" to DVD was done at the wrong aspect ratio.  Well, don't shy away from the purchase of this DVD because this is not correct.  The first widescreen movie, unless you stretch the definition to fit Abel Gance's unique Triptych sequences in 1927 for ""Napoleon,"" was in 1953 with ""The Robe.""  The aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1 or 4 to 3 (i.e. your standard TV set) is nearly correct for ""High Noon"" (go to the link [...] for details).
Now, if you want to see what happens to the aspect ratio of some films, see what's missing from the DVD and theatrical release of ""The Remains of the Day.""  James Ivory used the Super 35 process - the size of the original negative being 35 mm - so the film could easily be moved to tape or television without Panning and Scanning.  Ironically, there is far more image on the top and bottom on my VHS tape than in the theatrical release or DVD version.
Though the full camera negative was not meant to be shown in theatres because movie house screens usually take full advantage of their width, sometimes at the expense of a cropped top and bottom, to present a larger picture, on a traditional television screen the full 35 mm image has superior composition and feels far less cramped.  I feel it compliments aspects of the story, revealing more details.  Naturally, you can't say this about many films meant to be shown at 2.35 to 1 or greater.
I apologize for using so much space on this subject in a review dedicated to ""High Noon,""  but I want to make clear that just because a DVD says ""widescreen"" it doesn't necessarily mean you are seeing more of the image than you saw on your old VHS tape, though it usually does.  Conversely, if someone says a film should have been released on DVD in its widescreen format, don't believe them without checking it out at [...]  There may not be a widescreen version.
Regarding ""High Noon,"" I feel it is a compelling western that deftly uses the ""man alone"" theme to not only build suspense, but to build character, so to speak, as those who faced the charges before the House Un-American Activities Committee had theirs built.  Yes, Gary Cooper is apprehensive, even a bit scared, but he has the character to come through it all.
Despite John Wayne's indictment of the film as un-American, I think it is just the opposite, upholding the integrity of the individual when confronted by those who know no such integrity, either actively or passively.  Still, as a western, John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" broke new ground and ""High Noon"" did not.  Yes, having the action take place in real time is unusual but hardly unique.  It was done just as well three years earlier in Robert Wise's ""The Set-up,"" a sadly dismissed film of boxing and human courage.  And when ""High Noon"" is compared to the major works of America cinema like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""It Happened One Night,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Hustler,"" ""The Godfather"" (I and II), ""The General,"" ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" ""The Apartment""  and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or the masterworks of British cinema like ""The Third Man,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or one of my favorites, ""I Know Where I'm Going"" it must lose a half a star and maybe more.  Of course, I'm a tough grader.",1031270400,,3332,4.591905564924114
3161478,5,B0016MLIKM,"This a good western, but an even better movie. This movie is different from a John Wayne movie. The heroe admits he's afraid. There's no Elmer Bernstein orchestra blaring the credit, just Merle Travis playing the guitar, Cliffie Stone on bass, while Tex Ritters sings. There's none of the John Ford's great scenery. The west looks desolate in this movie. And little action. That's a warning to all teens who think that something has to blow up every few minutes.
  This a Frank Capra western, except unlike ""It's A Wonderful Life"" where the friends come to rescue to hero, everyone forgets the heroe. The emphasis is placed on building suspense and great characterization.  Sure they talk about what a good man he is, but noone wants to help except...  It has a short documentary as an extra. It's a shame that an audio commentary couldn't be provided by the some living character actors. Also I wish they could have shown two scenes that were deleted from the film. Overall, the number #1 reason to buy this DVD, is for the movie itself with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in her first major role. The score, the acting, the black and white color, the good vs. evil theme, the ticking clock, and the long shots of a lonely marshall by himself makes this a classic.",1028505600,,1262,4.620535714285714

One of the best actors in the movie is Katy Jurado, who plays a Hisanpic business owner.  What ever happened to her?

3161480,1,B0016MLIKM,"No doubt about it, Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly gave us a legendary performance in a brilliantly realized film.  This movie belongs in every casual fan or afficianado's collection.
  Quite sadly Republic Entertainment produced the DVD in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio to fit your TV, instead of preserving the original theatrical aspect ratio (letterbox).  The clipping off the edges of scenes or worse still the characters faces was distracting throughout the movie.  Basically ruining an otherwise enjoyable movie experience. Personally I think releasing a DVD without at least the option of the original aspect ratio for any movie, let alone a Hollywood classic, should be a criminal offense.  This is unforgivable.  Shame.
If you have to satisfy your High Noon jones, rent it and return it.  Don't waste your money or shelf space on a bad DVD release of an otherwise fine film. With any luck the movie will be re-released in the original format and then DVD would come highly recommended.",1026259200,,983,5.0246913580246915
3161481,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper is one of an handful of actors whose strong moral compass never fails to ring true. From his earliest films in the silent era right up till his last works, Gary Cooper continually shows the viewer some lessons right out of Acting 101. He makes it look so easy, how to radiate controlled fear while disguising it as bland bravery. In HIGH NOON, Cooper learns a brutal lesson that everyone in the film well knew. In a moment of crisis, you can't count on ordinary folk for help. Ironically, it is the evil ones who are made of the required stern stuff to face a six-gun.
When Cooper, who plays Marshall Will Kane, learns that a recently released from prison convict is returning to town to settle a grudge against him, Cooper tries to enlist the aid of anyone who can help. His friends, his deputy, even his wife fail to recognize the code that forms the bulk of his core. Just as his friends feel they cannot help him, Cooper is just as impelled to the opposite. By movie's end, he meets the bad guys, kills them, and then is stunned to realize that as this external battle has ended, a far more complex internal one is just beginning.
 HIGH NOON stands out as a masterpiece, partly due to Cooper, but also to a fine supporting cast which acts as universal lightning rods to attract a swirling torrent of fear, from which not even Cooper is immune. Lon Chaney as the cowardly politician, LLoyd Bridges as the equally cowardly deputy, Katy Jurado as the Mexican woman who once loved Kane but has lost him to Grace Kelly all shine in roles that require them to walk a fine line between bouncing off Kane with just the right force to serve as a dramatic foil and yet not divert the audience's attention for too long as Kane sees who they are and what he must be.
 HIGH NOON is no subtle exploration of the different essences that separate hero from villain from coward. This movie delineates in a starkness that matches the black and white filming the need for even a brave man to look within to find the strength that others routinely know is missing in them but take for granted in him.",1025308800,,2096,4.427461139896373
3161482,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is one of my favorite westerns and that is high praise since I normally do not like westerns, it takes a lot for a movie in the genre to impress me. An instant classic, in recent years this film has been maligned. From what I understand, most of the negative feeling is because the movie has been so hyped. It is unfair to hype a movie so much since it raises impossible expectations. I was fortunate enough to have somehow missed the hyping. (Odd, since I love old movies) So when I saw this movie at the rental store, I vaguely remembered hearing it was good so I got it.
The plot involves a lawman who will not leave town when he hears a killer he put in jail is released and will arrive on the noon train. His life falls apart, his friends abandon him, his wife leaves him but his honor will not allow him to leave. If this plot sounds cool, you will probably enjoy this movie. If not, you may want to try something else. You either accept the concept or you don't.
Watching the movie, several things impressed me.
First, I was impressed by Gary Cooper's acting. This was the first movie I ever saw him in and his anguish and nobility are just great. He richly deserved his oscar. The other standout is Katy Jurado as Cooper's old flame. While some racial bariers were coming down in the 50s, it was still very refreshing to see a Mexican character played by a Mexican actress in a movie of that time. She adds a note of authenticity to the movie that would not have been there otherwise and her performance is flawless.
Second, I enjoyed the fact that movie was black and white. Color films of the era were candy colored, almost too bright, which is fine for a comedy or a musical but kind of ruins historic movies for me.
Third, the suspense kept me glued to the screen until the last moment. And the ending was just great.
Whew! I guess I can see why so many critics hyped this movie! Well, don't let anyone else influence you. Try this movie out for yourself and draw your own conclusions.",1024790400,,2002,4.312997347480106
3161483,5,B0016MLIKM,"In 1952 writer Carl Foreman, director Fred Zinnemann, cinematographer Floyd Crosby and producer Stanley Kramer created a one-off recipe for a new kind of western.  The ingredients; Gary Cooper, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Grace Kelly, Lon Chaney, Henry and Otto Kruger interwoven with an unforgettable ballad written by Dimitri Tiomkin/Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter. The result is a movie with every second to be savoured.
Made at a time when sprawling landscaped Technicolor shoot-em-up westerns were the norm, High Noon was filmed in high contrast black and white.
Much of the film`s tension and excitement is due to the fact that each desperate minute that passes on screen is virtually equal to real time heightened by ever closening shots of clocks as noon approaches.
Marshall Will Kane is played faultlessly by Gary Cooper in probably his finest role.  Kane,  afraid, yet courageous and dutiful to his friends and townsfolk finds that, in his hour of need, they turn their backs on him. Kane`s anguished face was not all acting because Gary Cooper was suffering from a bleeding ulcer during filming and was concerned over the fight scene with Lloyd Bridges because of back problems.
A film of loyalty and of betrayal in which Kane is torn between his new wife, Amy (Grace Kelly) and his duty when he tells her
Kane:They`re making me run.  I`ve never run from anybody before.
Amy: I don`t understand any of this.
Kane: (looking at his vest watch) Well, I haven`t got time to tell ya.
Crucially, as time passes and tension builds, she speaks to Kane`s old flame, Helen Ramirez (played by Katy Jurado)
Helen: If Kane was my man, I`d never leave him like this.  I`d get a gun. I`d fight.
Amy:  Why don`t you?
Helen:  He is not my man. He`s yours.
When Kane does win through, with, finally,  Amy`s help, his so-called friends then rally round to congratulate him. With contempt he throws his star in the dust and drives off with Amy.
1952 was also `McCarthy` time. To some, unfortunately very influential people, High Noon was seen as `un-American`.  Not long after writing the script, Carl Foreman was blacklisted. Listed too was Lloyd Bridges who didn`t work for a few years after and of course Floyd Crosby (after all he had filmed it!).
High Noon is not only one of the best westerns ever made but one of the finest films ever created. Beautiful photography, outstanding minimalistic direction and taught editing with a screenplay magnificently performed by a superb cast.
There can be few people who have not seen High Noon and even fewer who can recall the outstanding original theatrical print having viewed it only on VHS or as a tv broadcast.
This DVD has transferred the sparkling high contrast images seen on the original 35mm negative. The image and sound quality of this DVD  breathes new life into a classic making it as fresh and thrilling as it ever was.

3161484,4,B0016MLIKM,"This 1952 western is a classic.  It earned Gary Cooper and academy award and also won for best film editing, best song and best musical score. I was very young when I first saw it and I remember being impressed.  And I don't think I can ever forget the song. Now, fifty years later, it's time to revisit it.
Well, one thing is clear.  I still love the song.  And it's no wonder that it's so memorable.  It's performed over and over throughout the film.  The words tell the whole story, simply and completely. The melody is haunting and a perfect background for the story, which also seems simple but deals with big themes - the struggle between good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, courage and cowardice and what it is to be a man.
Gary Cooper is cast in the role of the Sheriff, who has just wed his bride, Grace Kelly, and is giving up his badge because she is a Quaker.  He's been a good sheriff, brought peace and prosperity to the town.  But now, a man he had sent to jail five years previously has been pardoned instead of being hanged and has sworn to kill the sheriff.  Now he's coming back to town on the noon train. There's tension in the air, especially since three of the killer's outlaw friends have just ridden into town. The film is shot in real time, as the audience experiences the ticking of the clock as the big hands move towards the inevitable showdown.
Of course there are complications.  Grace Kelly refuses to support her new husband and buys a ticket on the train out of town.  A young hotshot deputy, Lloyd Bridges, who is romancing Cooper's former girlfriend, brilliantly played by Katy Jurado, gets into a fistfight with him. But mostly, it's the townspeople who turn away from him in his hour of need and most of the film consists of Cooper going from barroom to church trying to enlist a posse to help him.  Everyone turns their backs on him.  And when the showdown comes he's all alone.  It's a brilliant performance as we see the disappointment on his face over and over again and his expression of determination to stand tall and refuse to run away.  Cooper was 51 years old at the time and shows every bit of it.  There are lines in his face, bags under his eyes and looseness to his flesh. It's a refreshing reality in these days of plastic surgical perfection.  Grace Kelly, who was 23 at the time, is pretty but her performance rather stiff.  This was her first big role though and brought her the attention she needed as she established her career.
I felt the tension as the clock ticked away, enjoyed the clarity of the story.  I, too, counted the minutes till the whistle of the train and the bad guy stepped off.  However, at that point I fell asleep and when I awoke the film had just ended.  I was annoyed with myself.  But I glad this was a video and I could re-wind and watch it again.  And so I did, forcing myself to stay awake.  I then realized that it wasn't just because I was sleepy that I fell asleep.  The actual showdown was boring to me.  Fifty years of watching movies since then has spoiled me.  I just can't feel tension in this kind of gun battle in which the conclusion is evident.  This of course is not the fault of the film.  In the context of its time, it must have been great.  And it still holds up as a classic and that's why I give it an unqualified recommendation.  It's just a little hard to go back into a 1952 mindset.",1019260800,,3390,4.333333333333333

The beautiful theme music and the great performances by the rest of the cast make this the greatest western of all time. Noboby who enjoys films should miss this jewel. This is about a man who ignores every excuse,overcomes his very real human fears and does the right thing. The fact that his heroism is unappreciated does not matter,as we know it should not.

  I don't remember the exact quote, but I once saw a
 documentary on filmmaker Howard Hawks wherein the great
director finally explained to me why 'High Noon' is the one
supposedly classic western for which I have no patience.  It
went something like this:
  ""'High Noon?'  I hate that movie.""
  The interviewer did a double take.  Why? he asked.
  ""Because the Gary Cooper character is a joke.  He's not
serious about his work.  He's not a professional.  Grace Kelly
saves his lily-livered guts.""
  Aha!
  Mr. Hawks and I are not the only ones dissatisfied
with 'High Noon.'  I recall that screenwriter William Goldman
('Adventures In The Screen Trade') also holds it in low esteem.
  Now I'm not overly fond of the ""unbeatable"" heroes of the
 so-called Spaghetti westerns.  Nor am I favorable to John
Wayne's overbearing screen persona when the film is
mediocre.  ""Unbeatable"" western heroes are just too darn, well,
 unbeatable.  Not to mention too unflappable.  Not to mention
too expert at their trade by half, able to hit bad guys all day
long and half a mile away with a rusty Colt peacemaker.  But, at
 the same time, no other western has ever had a hero as pale and
 insufferable as Gary Cooper in 'High Noon.'
  Sure, if three guys were coming to kill me, I'd do just
what he does in the movie.  I'd run around looking for help, and
 when I didn't get it, I'd end up just like Mr. Cooper; I'd be
pretty worried.  Scratch that.  I'd be wetting my boots.
  So it's a perfectly reasonable argument that 'High Noon' is
 one darn realistic western.
  But who wants to watch Gary Cooper run around like that for
 two hours?
  Sheesh.

If that was all there was, it would be a good western.  It's the rest of the story that makes it great, not only as a western, but also as a classic.  The story is told in close to 'real time'and yet it covers years of history.  The woman who has been associated with three main characters (the bad guy, the sheriff, and the current deputy) and helps us understand all of them.  The town fathers who are suddenly unavailable when the sheriff could use help.

But what Skerritt and the other striking actors achieved is a modern classic. The scenery in Canada is far better than the 1952-background. This movie has a relaxed pace and Skerritt here is at the height of his art. The only other nowadays actor I can imagine in that role would be Sam Shepard.

The documentary is an important source of information about the film, especially the comments by the film's director Fred Zimmerman.  Matlin provides some excellent material on the film's relationship to the antics of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.  Most of this information is available in film history reference books, but its nice to find it on the DVD.
I can't think of a better method of teaching the essence of ""civic responsibility"" then using this marvelous film.
I should add that I'm a fan of ""B"" westerns, so it's not surprising that I'm raving about ""High Noon.""
It remains a mystery why Turner Entertainment would have ever wanted to remake this film -- impossible for a remake to even come close to this classic.",983750400,,1156,4.852791878172589
3161506,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is an astonishing western filmed in real time.  Gary Cooper has till the noon train to deputize people willing to stand up to Frank Miller, the town's former troublemaker.  Fred Zinnemann's tense direction makes the audience feel every ticking second!  Gary Cooper usually sucks, but I identified with his crisis in this film.  What would you do if asked to be a deputy and possible casualty for the sake of justice?  I sure wouldn't wear that tin star!  I sure would get shot!",982022400,,489,4.694117647058824
3161517,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper portrays Will Kane, a small town marshal who is retiring, getting married, and moving away to do other things.  Just before departing with his new bride (Grace Kelly), he learns that a murderous outlaw he captured five years ago has been pardoned and is coming in on the noon train seeking revenge.  Three of the outlaw's men are already waiting for their leader at the station.
Initially, Kane takes the townspeople's advice and hurriedly leaves with his wife.  But he soon determines that he must go back and face the villain.  First, he believes he and his wife stand a better chance in town than alone on the prairie against four assailants.  Second, even if he weren't immediately caught, he could be found and killed at any time in the future.  Third, his replacement isn't expected until the next day, so the town is without law enforcement.  Things could get so out-of-hand that the town would again become unsafe for decent people to raise their families, as it was before he became marshal.  Though Kane's decision entails great personal risk, he strongly believes that it is the right thing to do.
Back in town, Kane sets about the formidable task of trying to form a posse, with less than an hour until noon.  But support is not forthcoming.  Concerned for themselves and their families, people are less than eager to join with him in what looks like a suicide mission.  The credulity of the characters' reasoning and reactions as noon draws near is eminently believable, and is a big part of what makes this movie so great.  With each passing minute, Kane's untimely demise seems more certain.
This is a powerful movie about integrity and courage in the face of adversity; about strength of character and putting the common good before self.  These virtues are exemplified amidst a spectrum of other human responses.  Neither the age of the movie nor the fact that it was filmed in black & white detract from its excellence.  Tex Ritter's music accompanies Kane to great effect.  Superbly acted, suspenseful, and thought-provoking, this is a timeless classic.",980035200,,2084,4.844632768361582
3161518,5,B0016MLIKM,"This movie isn't really a true 'western' because a true western uses the west as a backdrop....making it a crucial part of the film.  Well, this movie really isn't about the backdrops...it's about Gary Cooper standing up by himself to do the right thing (fighting off the bad guys), even if he has no one else on his side fighting with him.  So, this movie is more of a morality themed film rather than a western.  This movie is so successful because, it's short, and it gets to the point, and it has a very good story.  If you think about why Hollywood would come out with a film that has a moral about ""doing the right thing, even if you must fight alone"" it's because at the time 'High Noon' came out (1953) , the U.S. was fighting the in Cold War..against the U.S.S.R...and it seemed the U.S. was the only country standing up to the Commies, like Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" standing up against the 4 bad guys.  My dad told me that, and it makes perfect sense to me, so I thought I'd put it in this review.  This is a great movie...even for people who aren't fans of westerns (like me) watch it! You will find it better than you expected it to be.",978134400,,1150,4.228310502283105
3161519,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is frequently mentioned among the best Westerns and even among the best films ever made.  It is rated #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 of the 20th century.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including best actor for Gary Cooper, best song and best editing.  But, was it really that good?  After all, it was a bare bones black and white Western in an age of Technicolor spectaculars.
It was that good and more.  ""High Noon"" was not really a Western as the genre had been defined to that point.  It was more of a character study of the human condition.  It just happened to be set in the American West.  Westerns at that time were action films with white hats and black hats.  There were fistfights and gunfights throughout the entire film.  They clearly differentiated good guys, on the side of justice and righteousness, from bad guys who spurned laws and sneered at those who obeyed them.  The heroes were always noble and fearless, typified by actors like John Wayne and Roy Rogers.  Moreover, the good guys always stuck together, despite all odds, to prevail against the outlaws.
""High Noon"" was the complete antithesis of this formula.  Kane is a flawed hero who is proud to a fault.  Although it is clear who the villain is, we never see him until the last ten minutes of the film.  The story is not about good and evil in the larger sense.  Instead, it is about conviction and integrity on a personal level.  Kane is portrayed as stubbornly putting his own feelings above the safety of the town.  He stands against everyone, willing to sacrifice his marriage, his friendships, his good name and his life for his honor and self-respect.  The biggest departure from the formula was his unabashed manifestations of fear.  This was unheard of for a Western hero.
Controversy swirled around this film, released in 1952 amid the Red Scare and the McCarthy Era.  The fearful and selfish townspeople who turned their backs on Kane were seen to be allegorical of the movie industry that abandoned those who were blacklisted as communists.  Many in the industry saw it as smug slap in the face.  John Wayne called the film ""un-American"", preferring to think that Americans would always stick together to fight injustice, ignoring the reality of numerous branded actors who couldn't get work.  Stanley Kramer, in an interview forty years later, continued to deny that there was any hidden agenda.  He said it was a film about human nature, and the coincidental fact that there was such a striking parallel was just an indication that human nature doesn't change.
The vanguard direction by Fred Zinnemann was nothing short of brilliant.  Zinnemann eschewed the Western formula and struck out in a completely different direction.  He chose black and white to give it a stark look.  The sky was overcast rather than sunny and blue.  The entire film was shot for only $700,000 (an extremely small sum even for 1952) almost completely on a studio lot.  This was the first Western, (and possibly the first film) to tell a story in real time (the story transpires in roughly the same amount of time as the length of the film).  The villainous Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) was known only through dialogue and he did not actually appear until the end of the film.  Zinnemann hung the pall of Miller ominously in the air like an evil spirit who was feared but unseen.  This made the villain bigger than life and added to the suspense.  Even when Miller finally arrived on the noon train, Zinnemann didn't let us see his face for a full two or three minutes, showing him strapping on his guns from behind and talking to his gang.  Finally, there was no action until the very end of the film.
He uses two very effective techniques to build suspense.  The first is the use of clocks.  In the beginning of the film, they were small clocks in the background that had short pendulums that swung quickly.  As we got closer to noon, the clocks got bigger and the pendulums swung more slowly making them more menacing.  At noon, the clock took up the entire screen as we waited for the last tick and the train's whistle.
The second technique was the repeated use of a static vista looking down the railroad tracks from ground level with no train.  This was a constant reminder that Frank was coming.  This created an extraordinary amount of tension.  Tinnemann's use of reaction shots and the editing by Harry Gerstad and Elmo Williams (who won an Oscar) were also brilliantly done.
The use of music was also innovative.  Rather than a full orchestra pumping out heart pounding adventure music, we had a simple ballad featuring a harmonica and the voice of country great Tex Ritter.  This haunting tune emphasized the loneliness of Kane's situation.
The acting was marvelous.  Gary Cooper is masterful as the tormented Marshall who stands against the entire town and his own fear to face down the Miller gang.  This film launched Grace Kelly's career.  She was not only shockingly beautiful but gave a fantastic performance as Kane's wife, who all but abandons him.  Lloyd Bridges also shines as the hotheaded deputy.  Other notables included Lon Chaney, Harry Morgan, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef.
This film redefined an entire genre.  It has been called the quintessential Western, but that is too narrow in its praise.  It is quintessential filmmaking, a perfect 10.  It is required viewing for film buffs who appreciate the creative aspect of the art.  Besides that, it's great entertainment.",973382400,,5526,4.756046267087276
3161520,4,B0016MLIKM,"By the time the strong, soft-spoken ""High Noon"" was released in 1952, Westerns had become increasingly thoughtful. Facing the villain may have been a necessity, but it was done with doubts or drawbacks, even recriminations. In ""High Noon"" the respected marshal of a small, isolated town must face the return of a convict being released from the prison term to which the marshal had sent him. The marshal has just married a Quaker woman and is retiring from his post to run a store in a distant town. Knowing that the ex-con's primary objective in coming to town is to kill the marshal, the population (including venerable character actors Thomas Mitchell, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney, Jr.) would just as soon the marshal leave as quickly as possible and let nature take its course. (I THINK the idea is the ex-con and his henchmen will ride into town, ...,  maybe rob the bank, then be on their way.) The marshal, however, feels morally compelled to stand his ground against the threat, asking only for a little support. Slowly, the whole town turns against him. Carl Foreman's tight screenplay sets up the situation expertly, and the fine craftsman Fred Zinneman was chosen to direct. The picture opens on the plains outside town, and the first close-up belongs to Lee Van Cleef, which is perfect. He had the meanest eyes in movies: one glance and you knew somebody was in deep trouble. When the story moves into town, there are constant references to time, with a wall clock visible in three opening interiors. Because the story is told in ""real time"", the editing and continuity are crucial, and the editors deservedly won an Oscar, as did Dimitri Tiomkin's theme song, sung by Grand Ole Opry star Tex Ritter. Gary Cooper won his second Oscar playing the marshal. He was obviously old enough to play the heroine's father, not her bridegroom; but I think his maturity heightens the film's sense of impending mortality. The marshal is a man with death on his mind, so there is a minimum of that goofy shyness that was a part of Cooper's romantic shtik. In contrast to the marshal is his deputy, played by a young Lloyd Bridges, whose bland good looks and slightly puzzled expression cause the other characters to dismiss him as immature. And the sultry Katy Jurado is suppose to be his mistress!? She treats him like cookies and milk. Completing the contrast is Katy Jurado's brunette mystery against the pellucid beauty of Grace Kelly. This was Grace Kelly's second picture -- she gets fifth billing. She had made her film debut the year before in a psychological study called ""Fourteen Hours"", which evidently is not available for home viewing. (As I recall, a distraught Richard Basehart is threatening to jump from a high building ledge, unaware of how he is affecting other lives, including that of Grace Kelly's character, a young socialite seeking a divorce at her lawyer's office in a nearby building.) In ""High Noon"", once the ex-con and his gang enter town, the climax is succinct and surprisingly cynical. Suffice it to say, the townspeople finally come out of their hiding places to give support. Without a word, the marshal takes off his tin star and throws it in the dirt. So much for frontier law and order. It's a quiet and powerful ending for a quiet and powerful Western.",971395200,,3286,4.785211267605634

3161522,4,B0016MLIKM,"I was prompted to watch High Noon by Dennis Prager's Nationally syndicated radio program, The Dennis Prager Show.  I must admit, I missed most of his conversation about the film, but I figured if the intelligent Dennis Prager  spent a weekend watching an old western instead of devouring some lofty  tome, there must be something to it.
Indeed there was, and is.  High Noon  is a classic western, with a clear demarcation between good and evil.  What  I found interesting however, was how relevant the issues within this  sampling of the old-fashioned western genre are today.  Quite simply, the  story is about the dilemma societies face when confronted with truly evil  people intent on doing harm to others.  Based on the shootout in the end  (traditional western stuff here) one might think the answers are simple.  But the well-crafted script leads the viewer through the myriad of  perspectives on issues such as capital punishment, duty, courage and honor,  societal apathy and the agonizing personal decision to stand up for what  one thinks is right.  A truly well-done cinematic dissertation on the  issues that spark public debate today.
I recommend the movie not just for  those reasons stated above, but also because its just a plain-old well-done  movie and story.  It defies its age.  A classic for all time.",963964800,,1323,4.967889908256881
3161523,2,B0016MLIKM,"American Heritage magazine called it one of the most overrated Westerns of all time and I couldn't agree more.  When I read a plot summary of this movie, I could not wait to get it home and watch.  I could not believe how  disappointed I was.  The plot had so many details and layers that could  have been explored, but no.  It fails on almost every level.  The only  saving grace is that Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly look good in it. Also, I  appreciated the unself conscious approach to references to an interracial  romance that ended before the beginning of the movie, something quite  remarkable for a movie from the early fifties.  Everything else is just off  the mark.  I still can't believe that Tiomkin's song became so popular.  There are so many holes in this most boring of scripts.  What really  shocked me was the subpar cinematography and production values, especially  for a film that they obviously had spent a lot of money on.  The story  takes the course of a single day, but there were so many continuity  problems in terms of lighting(i.e. 5pm looked like noon and noon looked  like dusk).  Grace Kelly spends the entire film wandering around and  pouting.  Cooper and Lloyd Bridges were absolutely disappointing.  I gave  it two stars only because it was a very influential film and became its own  archetypes for many films to come.  This movie represents all the ills that  come from a film industry that was oppressed by production codes and  McCarthyism.  Don't waste your time.

But Duke's loss  is our gain, because it's hard to imagine anyone played Sheriff Will Kane  like Cooper.
The cinematography and direction are sublime, the tension as  good as anything Hitchcock came up with. Grace Kelly has a small part but  is effective, as is the always brilliant Thomas Mitchell.

3161554,5,B0016MLIKM,"HIGH NOON continues to resonate with audiences today, almost 50 years after its 1952 release. That such a dark, bleakly cynical movie should remain so popular is at first thought surprising. Of course, there are  obvious reasons why this is so. It is a terrifically tense story. Has  involving characters, tight script, splendid direction, wonderful editing,  cinematography, soundtrack, and a towering performance from Cooper (and not  due to his suffering with an ulcer while it was filming, as some would have  you believe). But it is reaching new audiences, especially women. Indeed,  it is being taught in many feminist courses in college. And the feminist  approach to Cooper and his dilemma and his reaction to it is very  intriguing. Here's a man who is the king of the town, the toughest man  around, lord of his realm. However, he meets a younger woman, falls in love  and marries her. Then comes word that four men are coming on the noon  train, and very likely are coming with one purpose, to kill him. His wife  wants him to leave and they start out. But he stops and says he can't  leave: ""They're making me run and I've never run from anyone  before."" Back they go to town. Everytime he is asked why he isn't  leaving, his only response is: ""I don't know."" The feminist take  on this makes perfect sense: Here's the lord of his realm newly married,  and his wife has him quitting his job, leaving his town, his friends, and  moving to a town of her choice, where he will open a store (her choice) and  help her run it (her choice). He is no longer his man, he is her man. By  staying and facing his would-be killers, this man is rebelling, making a  last-ditch stand to preserve his ""masculinity"", to show himself  and others -- and his wife! -- that he is still in control. This adds a  rich new dimension to every situation and character conflict throughout the  film. Watch it from this perspective and you'll see an entirely new film.  Entirely new and still one of the grand all-time classics. Interesting  sidebar: During the filming, Cooper became friendly with writer Carl  Foreman. They agreed to form a company, Cooper would star, Foreman write,  Stanley Kramer produce. But John Wayne, Ward Bond and others wanted Foreman  blacklisted. They put pressure on Cooper and director Fred Zinneman to  quit, or their careers would be ruined. Cooper and Zinneman refused,  sticking by Foreman. When liberal Kramer caved in, Cooper threatened to  walk, which meant there'd be no film, since it was an independent  production, and a Salinas lettuce grower had invested only if Cooper would  star. Eventually, Wayne and the others got their way and Foreman was  blacklisted. Kramer backed out of the company. Cooper offered to go public  with Foreman about the company, even offered to go to Washington to testify  on Foreman's behalf before the House Un-American Activities Committee (this  from a man who was a deservedly awkward and embarrassed friendly witness in  1947, even though he named no names and said he wanted no-one hurt). But  Foreman finally threw in the towel, was blacklisted, and moved to London.  But ever after, he always said that Cooper was the only ""big one""  who stood by him. He also sent to Cooper for first consideration all of his  scripts after this, including: BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, THE KEY and GUNS  OF NAVARONE. John Wayne's despicable role in the Hollywood blacklist is  something which is rarely talked about. Wonder why?",952992000,,3476,4.78752107925801

3394730,1,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is an unpatriotic movie, a slap in the face of the Americans who had just fought World War II and were at the time of the its release fighting in the Korean War, preventing South Korean from becoming a nightmarish communist state like North Korea. The movie portrays the towns people as self-serving cowards who refuse to join the fight against the bad guys. The towns people represent the American people.

The movie came out in 1952 just 7 years after a half millions soldiers gave their lives to fight fascist Nazi Germany and Japan. American soldier who helped liberate German concentration camps. In movie theaters would have sat veterans of that war. And what they didn't understand was they were enjoying a movie that mocked and insulted them and their sacrifice. In addition, American soldiers were dying in the Korean War trying to fight the expansion of brutal communism. And just a couple years earlier seventeen American aircraft crashed and 31 Americans lost their lives during the Berlin Blockade, a blockaded imposed by Soviet communists.

Carl Foreman created the story of High Noon to get at Americans for the backlash against former communists in Hollywood. Foreman had been summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and he admitted having been a member of the American Communist Party. Given the sacrifice Americans made to destroy Hitlers military machine and rescue Jews from concentration camps, the movie can be considered not only unAmerican but a mocking of the American soldiers who sacrificed so much during those wars.

3394756,4,B0016MLIKM,"I first saw this film more than half a century ago, a few years after it was first released in 1952. It is one of those iconic American films  a Western  with pretty much clear-cut characters who wear the white hat (singular) and the black hats (plural), with a lot of hats on the darker shade of gray, worn by the towns people. It was produced by Stanley Kramer, written by Carl Foreman, and directed by Fred Zinnemann. Grace Kelly, before she married a Prince (of Monaco) was the lead actress. Lloyd Bridges, before Sea Hunt fame, was the Deputy Marshall. It is difficult to imagine anyone other than Gary Cooper wearing that one white hat, but it turns out he was the SIXTH choice, after John Wayne and Gregory Peck and three others had turned it down. And lawdy, the tricks half a century can play on the neurons. I remembered a classic one-on-one shoot-out on Main Street but that is from Gunsmoke! Actually, it was one against four, with some vital last-minute support from a woman who decided to stand by her man.

The setting is the small up-and-coming town of Hadleyville, in the Territory of New Mexico (of all places), though it was filmed in California. Some themes are eternal, it seems, like catch and release, - which is a currently complaint here in Albuquerque, about our criminal justice system, - and which was the impetus to the entire drama set back in the late 19th Century. Frank Miller wears the blackest hat, having been convicted of murder, sent up for life, sentence reduced, then paroled. He is making a bee-line to Hadleyville to settle some scores, and is arriving on the noon train, hence the films title. Three of his sidekicks are waiting at the train to assist. Meanwhile, Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) had already resigned as Marshall and had married Grace Kelly that morning. He could (and many say should) leave. But he just cant, despite the threats and nagging from his new wife. The Judge who sentenced Miller, however, gets out while the gettin is good.

Marshall Kane had cleaned up the town so that women could walk the streets without being accosted.  Hum!  Another plus ca change from todays headlines. There is a scene in which Kane expresses Christ-like doubts; he also considers skipping out. And the strongest character may well be a Hispanic woman, Ramirez, the owner of the saloon and hotel, who seems to run through and chew up the gringo men, starting with the black hat, Frank Miller, then switching colors to the white hat Kane, and even has a fling with the immature Lloyd Bridges. The one aspect of the movie that would have to be left on the PC cutting room floor are the two scenes of the two Indians, one on each side of the saloon room door, with a single feather in each hat.

It was also interesting reading about the political controversy surrounding the film which on the surface seems rather uncontroversial. But 1952 was during the Korean War, the height of the Red Scare and the witch-hunting of the HUAC. The writer for the film, Carl Foreman, would be blacklisted.

A central theme is the fickleness of the towns people who will not support their Marshall, despite everything he has done for the town. It is one man alone, against the forces of evil and therefore a favorite of politicians, as well as others engaged in Sisyphean tasks. May the white hat win in the end. Overall, 4-stars.",1509494400,,3356,4.638047138047138

3394770,4,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is a classic western movie coming out in the golden age of Hollywood.  I recently viewed it on Hulu Classics and thought it was good.  It is a pretty basic story of a small town marshal Will Kane on his last day on the job, who gets married and then finds out a man he put behind bars is once again free looking for revenge and coming in on the noon train that day.  The characters are all pretty interesting and you can see a lot of different points of view from all the towns people.  Gary Cooper and the whole cast do an excellent job.

With the way the word spread around this tiny western town of the outlaws return in less than an hours worth of time you would think everyone had society media like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram back then.

The film is good and I liked the feeling of impending dread and fear the townspeople display.  The clocks are in nearly every scene in the film as it gets closer to 12 Oclock.  The marshal repeatedly fails to get together a pose to take on the outlaws.  Eventually abandoned by everyone he takes on 4 outlaws by himself.

Now each minute in the film feels like 20 minutes gone by, it is hard to believe the Marshal would have time to get into a fistfight and get fixed up by the local barber, let alone make it to a tavern, a church and several house calls all in the short amount of time before the train arrives.  The marshal had maybe an hour tops once he found out the news.

I liked how his wife shot one of the bandits and didn't act like a helpless damsel in distress and actually took matters in her own hands.  I would have liked it even more if she would have shot at Frank Miller as he attempted to abduct her leading to the finale.

I recognized Lee Van Cleef right away at the beginning and I thought he was the main villain and the train would be coming with more goons or bandits.  Another thing that I thought about was how much one of the outlaws was drinking before the shootout,  I would of thought the film would have made a point of showing him stumble or bumble his weapon because of all the liquor he drank up til that point but nothing really becomes of it.

If anything the only thing I found a bit lacking was the final confrontation with the lead villain Frank Miller.  The film seemed to end very abruptly without the Marshal shaming the townsfolk for their cowardice or at least have Will Kane slowly look around at all the people and let them know they were wrong to abandon him during his time of need.  That is the only reason why I would not give this 5 stars.

Overall I think this is a 4 star film. The plot is good with an interesting cast of characters. The running out of time aspect is well done and you can feel the tension in the air, but ultimately the shootout was not as good as the buildup.",1507593600,,2793,4.175373134328358

I don't watch Hollywood's products for realism or lessons in tactics and gunfighting.  If it is going to seriously annoy you that the fight could have been over as quickly as the O.K.

3394800,5,B0016MLIKM,"I saw this classic 1952 western, ""High Noon"" many years ago as a child or adolescent but had little recollection of it. The past few years I have become interested in American westerns and have read some of the literary examples of the genre, including works by A.B Guthrie and ""Butcher's Crossing"" by John Williams. I have also revisited some classic western films, such as ""Shane"". My book group recently discussed Williams' ""Butcher's Crossing"", and thus I was primed for more westerns. The timing was good, and I saw ""High Noon"" on screen at the beautiful AFI Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland. The AFI presented ""High Noon"" in celebration of the film's 65th anniversary and as part of a promotion of a new book, ""High Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic"" The author, Glenn Frankel, attended one of the earlier showings and signed copies of his book.

Westerns were everywhere in the 1950s and early 1960s. I became interested again to see the qualities the genre possessed beyond formulaic stereotyping. I also thought this once highly popular genre might still have something to teach about how Americans understood and could still understand themselves and their country.

The best works in the genre take formulaic elements and turn them into something original and creative. The books and films mentioned in the first paragraph of this review do so, and ""High Noon"" does as well. The film tells the story of Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper) who has served a small town. Hadleyville, in the Territory of New Mexico and cleared out its outlaws. Kane has just married Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) and is about to retire. He learns that a killer he was responsible for putting in jail years earlier had just been released and was returning to town with three other thugs. Kane determines to stand the killer and the gang down. Most of the film, shot in real time, shows how the townspeople were afraid and unwilling to help and how Kane's determination to fight the gang threatened his marriage just as it began.

On its release, ""High Noon"" was widely taken as a parable which critiqued Hollywood blacklisting, and, from the title, this theme is developed in Frankel's book. The film was properly seen that way both by its supporters and its critics in the 1950s. But if the film were only a topical critique of blacklisting, it probably would not have survived much less become a classic example of its genre. As with much art, the film has a breadth of meaning beyond political events,

Creative work often is ambiguous and will bear many meanings or interpretations. And so it is with ""High Noon"". I saw the film as a western and as a story of the qualities which made for settlement of the American West. These qualities included a devotion to law and to community. Even if the community displayed cowardice and timidity at a crucial moment, the community was still the source which gave meaning to the determined and purposeful acts of an individual, such as Marshall Kane. The film also emphasizes the importance of having a view of what is right and being willing to act upon it, toughness, and a certain stubbornness. In the film, Marshall Kane had these qualities while most of the town residents were timid and preferred not to get involved. The film celebrates Marshall Kane's loyalty, devotion to duty and willing to take a large chance. In the process, it also shows the community which was able to grow and thrive, after its cravenness, due to an act of courage. The film's exploration of character and community transcends Hollywood blacklisting.

There is a great deal to be learned about American creativity, American character, and the way Americans see themselves from American westerns and other parts of our popular culture. I was grateful for the opportunity to see this film in period theater, to enjoy it, and to think about its significance.

The music, the cinematography, the acting, and even the crystal clarity of the dialog are all excellent.  The plot is engrossing: retired Marshall Will Kane decides to return to town to face four outlaws bent on murdering him.  But what is his motive: duty to protect the town's citizens? to be brave rather than cowardly? self-defense (since he specifically says he could not outrun them)?  He says he doesn't know his own motive, which is perplexing to the audience.  The main plot is bolstered by interesting sub-plots and unexpected events that make the movie more interesting.  However, several men in the church vow to assist Kane, but for no apparent reason (except as a plot device to leave Kane alone to become a hero) they forsake him.  Also, the fistfight in the barn makes no sense.  Finally, the large number of times the outlaws' bullets barely miss Kane in the gunfight seems highly improbable.",1496448000,,1004,4.763005780346821

'Marshall Will Kane' (Gary Cooper)  had cleaned up 'Hadleyville' (a small town in New Mexico territory) down the years making it
a safe place to live, he is now set to retire and start a new life in another town with his new-bride 'Amy' (Grace Kelly) as the
ceremony and celebration conclude three riders come into town 'Ben Miller' (Sheb Wooley) , 'Jack Colby' (Lee Van Cleef) and
'Jim Pierce' (Robert J Wilke) they are there to meet the noon train on which is 'Frank Miller' (Ian MacDonald)
'Will' had arrested 'Frank' some five years or so back, the vicious killer had been sentenced for a life-term in jail but had been
released early and is returning to 'Hadleyville' with revenge in mind.
When this news reaches the wedding party, 'Will' and 'Amy's' friends urge them to leave town immediately to start their new-life
together before the train arrives in little over an hours time.
The three that wait for 'Frank Miller' are members of his old gang.
'Will' and 'Amy' set off, however a short way into the journey 'Will' pulls up the carriage, he just can't leave the town open to the
will of 'Frank Miller' and his side-kicks, the new Marshall doesn't arrive until tomorrow.
Back in town 'Will' is confident that he'll be able to raise a posse, he has many friends in town many of whom had stood with him
during troubled times in years gone by.
However, even his deputy 'Harvey Pell' (Lloyd Bridges) throws in his badge upset that he'd not been appointed 'Will's' replacement,
and his so-called friends refuse to join in the fight.
'Will's' new bride not wanting to see her husband killed decides she'll leave town on the noon train 'Frank' is arriving on, the judge
that convicted the killer is also set to leave town.
'Will' must question why he has returned, is it to protect those that refuse to help, is it because if the fight isn't finished now, 'Frank'
will only hunt him down, or is it pride ?
Because the three gunmen are at the station waiting, 'Amy' goes back into town to await the train joining 'Frank's' former lover
'Helen Ramirez' ( Katy Jurado) who also intends leaving on the train..
'Will' waits alone for the noon train and the inevitable show-down.
This a tension-filled affair as the hour leading up to noon ticks slowly by

Well done DVD of an Western Classic everyone should see and get!

The bonus features are incredibly immersive and in-depth. I especially loved the essay narrated by the late Anton Yelchin.

If you love High Noon, Westerns, or just movies in general, this release is for you. And who knows, if Olive's Signature series continues after this strong start, they just might give Criterion a run for their premium-label money",1475452800,,585,4.898989898989899
3394906,5,B0016MLIKM,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ive talked before about the resurgence in classic movies making their way to blu-ray format. Its a treat for movie fans and students of film to finally see these films in the most pristine condition possible. One company thats been releasing films this way, everything from schlock drive-in films to full blown top notch older blockbusters, is Olive Films. Most of their releases have been simple, the title alone with few to no extras. Now theyve decided to add their name to the list of companies that handle the classics they have the right to in full blown fashion with their Signature Series. These movies offer the cleanest prints possible as well as some extras thrown in. Its a pure pleasure to see these this way and Olive has kicked it off with one of the all-time classics, HIGH NOON.
If youve never seen the film the plot on the surface is fairly simple. The sheriff of a small western town, Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is taking off his badge and getting married to Amy (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who doesnt believe in violence or his carrying a gun. But immediately after their marriage and before they can leave word reaches Kane that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) has been pardoned from prison and Millers gang is waiting at the train station for his arrival on the noon train to arrive. Kane straps his guns on again against the protests of Amy who says she will leave him if he does. What follows is Kanes attempt to get the town people to rally behind him to take on the gang. But no one does, leaving him to stand alone against the four men.
So thats a long paragraph but sums up the surface story being told here. What it doesnt tell is the story that lies underneath it all and one that Hollywood reacted to. The reality is that beneath that surface was the story of screenwriter Carl Foreman who wrote the screenplay and the problems he faced with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). While most think of Sen. Eugene McCarthy and the word McCarthyism with these activities he actually came into the situation later and investigated politicians as opposed to Hollywood.
HUAC was investigating the influence of Communism in the world of entertainment and looking to find out just who was a Communist. They put aside the fact that many were registered as such during WWII when Russia was our ally. Instead rather than seek out any true saboteurs of traitors they labeled anyone connected to the Communist Party as such. Foreman had registered as a Communist years before and only remained involved with them for a year before leaving. But he didn't like the tactics used by HUAC to ferret out people they felt were traitors.
HUAC offered two alternatives. You either provided them with names of anyone else you associated with the Party or you were basically run out of the business or worse imprisoned. Foreman stood up to these methods by admitting his being a member for a single year but refusing to name names. He ended up leaving the country for England.
Now the story of HIGH NOON might seem about a sheriff against an outlaw. But in truth the parable is telling the story of a man standing up for what is right and finding that no one will stand with him. The worst examples of western folk hate him for sending Miller to prison and taming their town, the result of which was their inability to do what they pleased. But then the upstanding members of the community don't back him either. They claim he was paid to handle things, that they will find themselves looking bad before politicians or that this isn't their fight. In the end he finds himself alone taking on the problems the world has placed in front of him, the same situation Foreman found himself in with his fellow writers, producers and studio members. No one stood with him. That is the real story behind HIGH NOON.
Olive has done a spectacular job with this release. Ive never seen the print of this film look so vibrant, something that many won't understand since the film is in black and white. But never fear black and white films. It is the story that matters not the flash of color. And if you are one of the few whove started down the 4k trail it is indeed a 4k master.
Theyve also put together an impressive collection of short featurettes that add to the enjoyment of the film and its background. Included are: A Ticking Clock - Academy Award nominee Mark Goldblatt on the editing of High Noon; A Stanley Kramer Production - Michael Schlesinger on the eminent producer of High Noon; Imitation of Life: The Blacklist History of High Noon - with historian Larry Ceplair and blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein; Ulcers and Oscars: The Production History of High Noon - a visual essay with rarely seen archival elements, narrated by Anton Yelchin; Uncitizened Kane - an original essay by Sight and Sound editor Nick James; and finally the theatrical trailer. None of these is overlong and actually add to the enjoyment of the movie you can discover after your first viewing.
With the quality on hand with this release it makes me look forward to future Olive Films Signature Series releases. My guess is that all other film fans will feel the same way. And at a list price on amazon of $16.99 it makes it a value not to be beaten.",1475107200,,5297,4.617179215270413

3394909,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon stars Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane, who marries Quaker girl Amy (Grace Kelly) and prepares to leave town a day before the replacement marshal is scheduled to arrive. But Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), along with his band of men, is arriving on the noon train, seeking revenge against Kane, who realizes that he must finish this battle. He spends a large part of the film trying to enlist help. Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges) refuses to join Kane because hes now dating the marshals former lover, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado), and believes she still has feelings for him. Other townspeople turn their backs, leaving him to face imminent danger alone. As the clock ticks closer to noon, Kane does his best to prepare for the inevitable showdown.

High Noon is regarded as one of the best Westerns in movie history. Though the story is fairly straightforward and draws upon common themes of the genre, the film is elevated by excellent performances, not only of Cooper, but supporting actors Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan, Jack Elam, and especially Lon Chaney, Jr. as Kanes wise mentor, who delivers some of the movies best dialogue. Cooper himself, known for being the strong silent type, is true to form here, though his performance makes clear that Kane knows full well that the confrontation with Miller and his men may be his swan song. Grace Kelly doesnt have a large role, but does an effective job as a woman sworn to non-violence who finds herself in the midst of the climactic gunfight.

The black and white cinematography by Floyd Crosby is impressive. One shot, in particular, stands out. After Kane has exhausted his entreaties for help, he stands in the street, alone. As he turns to go to the railroad station where Miller waits, the camera pulls back and up, emphasizing both Kanes lack of back-up and his vulnerability.

Bonus extras on the unrated Blu-ray release include the featurettes A Ticking Clock, a discussion of the films editing; A Stanley Kramer Production (background on the producer); Imitation of Life: The Hollywood Blacklist and High Noon, featuring blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein; Oscars and Ulcers: The Production History of High Noon; and Uncitizened Kane, an original essay.

3394912,5,B0016MLIKM,"Sixty-four years on, ""High Noon"" has aged well.  Its depiction of the Old West, all dusty streets, dull grey skies, and otherwise complete lack of monumental vistas is surprisingly modern, focusing more on the characters than the setting in its anticipation of many Westerns which followed it, an extreme example being Tarantino's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hateful-Eight/dp/B01A53WR3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hateful Eight</a>, which, although nominally a ""Western,"" takes place almost entirely within a single room.  The only ""action,"" such as it is, is the shootout at the very end; the real action is in the second act as the sheriff attempts to enlist the help of the townspeople in what at bottom is a personal dispute.  Some people are prepared to step forward, but only if everyone else does; when it becomes clear that Frank Miller is only returning to settle his score with the sheriff, Kane's insistence on staying to face him becomes nothing more than an expression of pride and ego, especially since he is, at that point, no longer officially the sheriff.

Unusual for many films, the story unfolds in real time; the film's actual length of around an hour and a half covers the period from Kane's wedding until the end of the showdown.  ""High Noon"" was also an early example of a film with a unique theme song; sung by Tex Ritter (father of actor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Ritter/dp/B00KN2KY4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Ritter</a>, it's repeated throughout the film, not always appropriately, and to the point of annoyance, like the song in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Cowboy/dp/0792833287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Cowboy</a>&nbsp;- a soundtrack album consisting of a one-sided single.  ""High Noon"" would be two-sided, as there's a rendition of ""Buffalo Gals"" at one point.

""High Noon"" has endured because it presents a complex situation - on one hand, the townspeople are shown to be cowardly ingrates, who refuse to help the sheriff who is described as the man who made the town safe for women and children, but on the other hand, no one should be obligated to risk their life for a completely avoidable personal vendetta.  We are contemptuous and sympathetic at the same time, because we know how each of us would react in a similar situation.",1472947200,,2453,5.794444444444444

3394960,3,B0016MLIKM,"The just-retired sheriff of an Old West town gets married and, upon hearing the news that the criminal who had had control of the town whom he had sent to prison is free and coming back to take revenge on him, quickly flees with his bride...and several miles out, decides to turn back, as the new sheriff has been delayed in arriving. But upon his return, he finds a gang of the criminals' cronies waiting for their old boss to arrive and all the townspeople completely unwilling to help him; some out of preference for the days when the criminal ran the town, but most out of sheer cowardice, and even the sheriff's pleading with all the townspeople to help him deal with the criminal fails to move them. But in the end the sheriff decides he will face them even if it means his death. Even his wife, who had become a Quaker in reaction to several violent deaths of her family members, is ready to desert him. (Uh, she just married an ex-sheriff, whose job included carrying a gun and using it on occasion?)

The movie is said to be a thinly-disguised attack on the House Unamerican Activities Committee, which was then investigating Communist influence on the Hollywood movie industry. The analogy is simple: the criminal gang represents the HUAC, the townspeople represent people in Hollywood who are too afraid of the HUAC to stand up to them, and the ex-sheriff is the hero who will face the HUAC himself, with or without help. The cowardice of the townspeople is all too contrived; the gang the ex-sheriff faces is small, unimpressive, and easily defeated. The comparison of the HUAC to criminal thugs also falls apart; the HUAC had genuine popular support and had noble intentions, whether wrongheaded or not. Communist infiltration into the Hollywood movie industry really existed; the extent may have been overestimated but it was genuine.",1464566400,,1848,4.775

You must see it at least twice, as the second viewing gets you deeper into the story and the fright and evil of the characters who abandon the sheriff.

3395128,4,B0016MLIKM,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this western...

High Noon (1952) is considered not only one of the greatest westerns of all time, but one of the greatest movies of all time, no matter what the genre.  The movie is well shot, well edited, and the picture quality is excellent.  Most of the acting is good, however...

I feel this movie is somewhat overrated, though it does have a lot of strong points.  It doesn't grab me as much as so many other westerns do.  It isn't the black-and-white photography, as I love black-and-white movies, no matter what the genre.  I think the lack of scenery, the lack of action, and the excessive dialogue throughout make the movie a little less appealing to me compared to other westerns.  The strong points of this movie are the editing, the pretty good acting, the all star cast, and the crisp black-and-white photography.  The best part of this movie is Grace Kelly and Katy Jurado, both of whom give good performances, especially Jurado.  This movie also stars Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney, Henry Morgan, and Lee Van Cleef.  This movie attempts to make somewhat of a political statement much like Johnny Guitar (1954) does, but the difference is that Johnny Guitar is a 5-star movie.  Don't get me wrong, I think High Noon is a very good movie, just not quite worthy of a 5 star rating when compared to other westerns that ARE worthy of a 5 star rating.

If you're into westerns that have a lot of action and more of a true western feel and attitude, I suggest sticking with the Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, John Wayne, and Jimmy Stewart westerns.  Also see Shane (1953).

Personal favorite: Clint Eastwood's
Second place: Kevin Costner's",1453593600,,1766,4.722222222222222

3395177,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a really great movie.  It is shot in real time.  The movie lasts the same length of time as is depicted on the clocks in the small town.  One could cut the tension with a knife.  The movie is shot in black and white that was meant to increase dramatic effect.

The acting is great.  Gary Cooper is the lead.  He plays an upright town marshall that the town abandons.  He is married that day to a lady played by Grace Kelly.  This is Grace Kelly's second movie appearance.

The movie is based on a short story named ""The Tin Star"".  The short story I am speaking of was composed by John Cunningham.  I found it in a fine compilation A Century of Western Short Stories edited by a gentleman name John Jakes.  I have read this short story.  The movie has significant changes and is far superior.

I do not know how many books have been written about High Noon.  I had not read any.  But I am currently reading one of the best biographies that I have ever read. It is about Grace Kelly.  It is named ""Grace, A Biography"".  It is written by Thilo Wydra.  I. This very detailed biography, Mr. Wydra goes into many details about other people and movies, etc...

In this fine work, Mr. Wydra goes into great detail about this movie.  Mr. Wydra states that this movie is a metaphor for the McCarthy political era of the late 1940s and early 1950s.  I had never made that connection.  Mr. Wydra also states that the interactions between Grace Kelly and another female actress, Katy Jurado, is a debate about the roles of women and feminism.  I had never thought of that.

In any event, I recommend this movie standing on its own.  If, by any chance, you are interested in Hollywood history and the place of this movie in that history, you may wish to read Mr. Wydra's analysis.  Thank You.",1452124800,,1787,4.349544072948328

3395268,5,B0016MLIKM,"During the 1940's and early 1950's, the typical film Western was a cookie-cutter escapist story, usually involving a bad guy in a black hat, and a heroic good guy in a white hat. The innocent townspeople suffered at the hands and gun of the outlaw until the heroic lawman confiscated his gun, cuffed his hands, or in some cases shot him dead, not unlike the young knight saving the Princess from the villain in a Chivalric Romance. Instead of swords the characters wield 6-shooters. But High Noon is different. Here good and evil are more blurred, and the issue of indifference in the face of danger becomes the all-encompassing theme. Instead of a chivalric heroism, High Noon is a morality tale which has more in common with Shakespeare and even Greek tragedy than with knighthood romance. The script also served as a metaphor for the Hollywood Red Scare/Blacklisting which was a result of McCarthyism during that time. ""High Noon"", one of the few films regarded as both a classic and a masterpiece, inspired many later films and television, such as the morally ambiguous Sergio Leone Westerns of the 1960's, which would also star Lee van Cleef, who finally gets to talk! It would also inspire the television series ""24"" which is also based on the idea of ""real time"".

Despite popular misconception, the term ""High Noon"" meaning either the pinnacle/peak or the climax of a confrontation existed long before this film. The term itself dates from the late Middle Ages, and quotes from American Civil War primary sources (circa 1860's) use the phrase in the same way that it is treated in this film. The first audiences would have understood what the term meant in this context. The innovative concept which permeates the cinematic experience is having the events unfold in ""real time"" up until Noon. The first 90 minutes, from 10:30am to 12:00pm, are more or less 90 minutes of activity, and the audience is continually aware of the time with shots of different clocks and timepieces through this period which takes up about 75% of the movie.

The plot is deceptively simple which paves the way for much more complex thematic and even psychological underpinnings. Will Kane, played by Gary Cooper in an Oscar-winning tour-de-force performance, learns on his wedding day about the return of a bona fide killer, Frank Miller, recently released from prison. Kane had apparently incarcerated him, and Frank Miller is now on a train scheduled to arrive in town where his three associates are waiting for him at the depot. (One of his associates, who remains silent the entire time except for a harmonica, is played by a very young Lee van Cleef!) Kane had been the town Marshall but upon his wedding decided to voluntarily retire. However, the new Marshall was not scheduled to arrive until the next day. Kane resolves he must stay in the town and confront Miller, despite the protests of the townspeople. He solicits volunteer deputies for the task but the townspeople appear indifferent to the plight.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this film is the ambiguity. Although most of the town agrees that Frank Miller is a killer and outlaw, a few thrived under the anarchy of Miller, such as the owner of the local hotel who complains his business suffered when Kane moved in and stopped Miller. Which points to another interesting innovation: the film gradually reveals back-story but only as much as the characters decide to disclose. Only by the time Noon arrives has the audience put together the pieces of the larger puzzle. Even when we the audience first learn of the coming confrontation, there is much which remains concealed.

The main reasons the film works as well it does is because of the outstanding script, the believability of all the actors, and the compelling camera work which paints a very different image on its cinematic canvas. The scenes are shot rather starkly in front of a seeming cloudless sky. Periodically, we see the railroad tracks going off into the distance, knowing only that it is from these tracks something menacing will arrive. Cooper is absolutely outstanding, his performance so subtle and underplayed it appears effortless but simultaneously absolutely believable. The dialog is for the most part right on the money, never lapsing into clich&eacute;. Characters talk very little about the dilemma and are often reluctant to tell what they know. The Mexican woman who had been involved with both Miller and later Kane as part of the back-story is asked about what she knows from Kane's bride but refuses.

High Noon is a suspense film rather than a straightforward Western, which was one of its criticism early on but has over time become its strength. The subject could have been easily a film noir set in the 1940's with a killer arriving on a train into a city. But I think the starkness of a Midwestern American town circa 1870 gives the whole story a feeling of unease. Because the story relies more on drama and anticipation than pure action, High Noon rises above the fray and into the realm of drama which explores the tragic human condition. In this case, the tragedy is not one of unjustified death but the inability of humans to act courageously in the face of evil.",1433808000,,5220,4.860674157303371

3395272,5,B0016MLIKM,"This picture is a beautiful transfer on Blu-ray.
Though it is not my favourite Western - 'Shane' takes that mantle - High Noon still is a superior film, and it almost makes me say that Gary Cooper is the best film actor of all time because of it. (He is, and HN ranks no. 4 on my best Westerns in spite of him)

The photography is notable : so many close-ups of speaking actors whilst the background is notably misty ; not out of focus, but misty and almost cloudy. So the clocks and their timing (which is so apparent that many critics had nothing else more to say on this picture because perhaps they were dumb and bored and were looking at their watches) made the viewer a part of the action and the image and its background unresolvableness a split in perspective ; are we meant to feel that the townsfolk who were non-participants in the Marshall's concern oblivious to common time, as may we the viewer (being of course privy to both sides of a story) be so aware that there is so much to do in what little time we have ?

The Director, Fred Zinnemann, got a lot of flak here because his hero was a coward, and professional critics accused him of belittling the Western Tradition because a man of the west who won in the end did so out of fear and had his wife kill, unbeknown to himself, with a bullet in the back.
Westerns are no longer viable, I think, because the gladiator story has had its day ; Fred Zinnemann had made a Western which gave a fine Star full rein to his talent.
The Western, surely, could do with another fine morality tale such as this in which the winner might not be the protagonist, but a neutral suspect.",1431216000,,1637,4.27741935483871

3395415,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon, 1952 film

The film begins with a man sitting and waiting. Another comes to join him. Then a third man, and they ride into town. People notice them. Pierce, Miller, and Colby ask about the train schedule. Will Kane and Amy Fowler wed. Kane is the Town Marshal, but intends to quit. A telegram brings news of Frank Miller's pardon! [Some kind of payoff in those days?] Kane is advised to leave town. [Can every problem be avoided as a solution?] No, Kane decides to return; he doesn't even have a gun! [Unbelievable.] Kane could never be safe as long as those four were after him. ""I'm not trying to be a hero."" With special deputies he will outnumber them. Amy asks him to choose between her whims and his experience and judgment. The judge decides to skip town. Deputy Harvey goes to see Marshal Kane, he wants the job and a recommendation.

We learn about the past relationships of Harvey, Kane, and Frank Miller! Mrs. Ramirez wants to sell her store quickly so she can leave on the noon train. Will the hotel be more prosperous when Frank Miller is back? Harvey is in the saloon. Ben Miller drops in for a bottle. Kane asks for help in the saloon, none volunteer. [Why?] Neither does a friend. Jimmy asks to join, he used to be good with a gun. Kane goes to the church to ask for all the special deputies he can get to help him. The church members argue over what must be done. Time is running short. Can a problem be solved by ""deferred maintenance""? ""They just don't care."" [Why?] Mark says he is too old. Mrs. Kane visits Mrs. Ramirez for help, but she is leaving too. Amy's personal experiences are explained. [A clue to the future?] ""A smart man knows when to back away."" Harvey talks to Kane. [Does this fight make sense? Note the bruises.] One man had volunteered, but Herb doesn't like the odds. The clock strikes noon. The steam train whistles its approach. Kane writes a holographic Last Will and Testament.

Marshal Kane walks into Main Street and watches the wagon leave for the train station. Frank Miller detrains and joins those three men. Breaking glass warns Kane. Shots are fired, not it is three against one. The hunting goes on, one man runs into the barn. Now it is two against one. The stable is set afire. Kane frees the horses and escapes. One man is shot from behind! [I won't tell who did it.] Only Frank Miller is left. Then Kane appears in the street. It is over at last. Will and Amy are reunited. Will tosses his tin star into the dust.

""The Making of High Noon"" follows. Monochrome is used to reduce costs, as in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", when an unconventional movie is produced. This story is based on ""The Tin Star"", a 1947 story in Collier's Magazine. Carl Foreman was an ""unfriendly witness"" before HUAC, a man who stood for what he believed in. The script was an excellent drama. The low budget excluded the usual padding. Western movies show the pioneers who overcame adversity; this provides hope for the common people.

The story takes place in virtually real time. This is a morality play where a good man triumphs over villains. It doesn't give the background from five years ago when Frank Miller was convicted of manslaughter. Was he involved in the running of that ""hotel"" and a gambling casino? Did Will Kane move in to take over? In the 19th century the local Committee of Vigilance would have eliminated robbers and murderers. A Town Marshal was elected by the voters, but the local power elite would have selected a man to do their bidding. A Marshal who best represented the people would have no problem in getting special deputies. This story goes against these historical facts. Having a woman with a firearm is also unconventional, but few dared to comment on this. This one-man army is similar to the later ""Rambo"" movies.",1412640000,,3787,4.571428571428571

3395440,5,B0016MLIKM,"If you are looking for an action-packed western - this is not it.  It is, instead, a fascinating study of human nature, of group behavior - one is more likely to stand up to danger if others do, but less likely if others remain seated.  Many reviews of this movie may leave you with the impression that no one is willing to help the marshal meet the vengeful band of gunslingers, but there are a few - unfortunately for the marshal, none of them are suitable.

You may also have the impression that Marshal Kane is fearless - not so.  Kane passes through two moments of weakness.  The first occurs when he learns, after turning in his badge after the wedding, that a dangerous criminal, who swore to get him, is arriving on the noon train.  At the urging of the wedding party, he and his new wife flee town in their buckboard, but Kane can't escape his sense of duty and returns to town.

Mr Robert A. Harris - noted film archivist and restoration expert - panned this particular disc. In deference to his expertise, I didn't buy this at first, hoping for a better release to surface. Later, I read several reviews on Blu-ray.com and on Amazon - mostly praising this Olive presentation. I took the plunge.

3395459,5,B0016MLIKM,"Olive Film's 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition of High Noon (1952) presents this critically lauded, still controversial western masterpiece in a Hi-Def transfer that renders all other home video versions obsolete.

The Stanley Kramer production, tightly directed by Fred Zinnemann and written by the blacklisted Carl Foreman, earned the hatred of 1950s McCarthyists, including John Wayne and Howard Hawks, who were so outraged they made Rio Bravo (1959) as a right-wing response. Wayne went further than that, teaming up with Hollywood Gossip mogul Hedda Hopper and the House Un-American Activities Committee to run Foreman out of the country. Foreman moved to England and never returned. Wayne forever boasted of forcing the writer into exile. Kramer, responding to accusations that High Noon was anti-American, tried to get Foreman's name taken off the credits. Gary Cooper intervened on Foreman's behalf, making Kramer's effort unsuccessful, but Kramer had better luck forcing Foreman to sell his part of their company. So much for loyalty under pressure: ironic, given the film's theme of civic morality.

The biggest offense of the film, for Wayne and his fellow extremist kooks, was the final shot of Will Kane supposedly dropping his marshal's badge in the dust and stomping on it. Wayne saw symbolism aplenty, but his faulty vision was filtered through a lens of Cold War paranoia and exaggeration.[1] Will Kane merely dropped the badge. He never stepped on it. The other offense was the portrayal of the townspeople as a greedy, self-cannibalizing lot, a hypocritical church community who argue their way out of communal (and personal) loyalty. Wayne and Hawks' Rio Bravo depicted, in sharp contrast, a town full of old-fashioned buddy-buddy camaraderie. If Wayne and Hawks were alive today they might have rethought their depiction, because High Noon could served as an apt snapshot of contemporary division. It's a good thing that actor/director team didn't live to see the 21st century, though, because despite the intent behind Rio Bravo, and despite its occasional tendency towards sentimental phoniness, it remains, along with High Noon, one of the standout westerns in the genre's greatest decade.[2]

One cannot approach High Noon without addressing its political themes, both within the film's text and those raised in its aftermath. Along with writer Formean, co-star Lloyd Bridges and cinematographer Floyd Crosby were also awarded with temporary blacklists until the FBI cleared them of Communist affiliations. The fifty-one year old Gary Cooper was engaged in an affair with his twenty-three year old co-star Grace Kelly (putting an end to Coop's affair with Patricia Neal.) Kelly's fling with the long established Republican protected her from McCarthyism's scrutiny. Cooper was friendly with the HUAC, and testified before them (without ever naming names), but he only did what was expected of him, then returned to his top priority of resuming his romance with a future princess.

Cooper was in Europe by the time the Academy Awards Ceremony rolled around and asked Wayne to accept the award of Best Actor on his behalf, should he happen to win. Of course, he did, and the Duke did a prompt, public about-face in his acceptance speech: ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that we can all be proud of. Coop and I have been friends hunting and fishing for more years than I like to remember. He's one of the nicest fellows I know. And our kinship goes further than that friendship because we both fell off horses in pictures together. Now that I'm through being such a good sport about all this sportsmanship, I'm going back and find my business manager, agent, producer, and three-name writers and find out why I didn't get High Noon instead of Cooper.""[3]

The speech renders Wayne a hypocrite, since seeing potential red from the outset, it was he who first refused the role of Marshal Will Kane, thus paving the path for Gary Cooper in the part.[4] Yet, despite Wayne's standing as a precursor of Rush Limbaugh's pharisaical aggression, he can, perhaps, best be summed up in an assessment I was privy to in a screening of Red River (1948). The host, an erudite writer, had this to say about Wayne: ""I met the Duke's son Patrick. Unlike his dad, Patrick is a thorough gentleman; pleasant and courteous. Unfortunately, he also differs from his dad when it comes to acting because Patrick's a lousy actor. His dad was a great actor and that's not really up for argument.""

However, as skilled an actor as he was, Wayne as Will Kane would have been a loose right-wing cannon. Gary Cooper's brand of authentic conservatism merged seamlessly with his marshal. Cooper's laconic, weathered portrayal of internalized integrity shines through Zinnemann's opulent artistry.[5]

Ronald Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower were among the film's fans. Reagan saw positive American values in the theme of an individual placing the safety of his peers above his own personal interests. When I first saw the film in my youth, prior to readings of political allegories, my interpretation of the film paralleled Reagan's.

If Wayne has come to embody our idea of the snarling, mythological Westerner, Gary Cooper is our moderate, amorous Rino cowpoke. We readily accept his pairing with Grace Kelly's Quaker Amy Fowler (the ""darling Clementine"" of the film's theme song). Amy is a model of another form of extremism.  Amy's tragic past has rendered her a pacifist with a checklist, adhering to each dogmatic bullet point. Will cannot violate his conscience to succumb to any extreme ideology. We genuinely root for their reconciliation. Oddly, it is in its climax that we find High Noon is, in fact, a paradigm for conservative mythology. Once faced with physical threat, Amy's militant pacifism is, in fact, submitted as a futile, theoretical interpretation of Christian tenets. The townspeople, led by Mitchell, have their own ideological creeds, dictated primarily by the potential capital gains Frank Miller and his gang bring by their return to Hadleyville.

Katy Jurado's Helen Ramirez is the literary female counterpart to Kelly's pure Virgin Mary. Helen, the tainted Magdalene, is, of course, a necessary contrast, and she steals every scene she is in, despite Zinnemann's efforts to highlight Kelly. Not unexpectedly, there was rivalry between the two actresses on set. Lon Chaney, Jr. shines in his role as the arthritic former lawman and Kane mentor, Martin Howe. Chaney acts with such effective pathos that one wished producers had realized his greater potential as a character actor, rather than as a B grade horror star. Lloyd Bridges' portrayal of self-serving deputy Harvey Pell is less effective, occasionally stiff in line readings, and a noticeable case of miscasting. Lee van Cleef,  debuting here, was originally cast in the role of Pell, but he would not surgically alter his nose, which producers thought ""too villainous looking.""  Instead, Cleef was relegated to playing one of the thugs, setting him on the path to a wonderfully typecast career.

Editor Elmo Williams' work here is exemplary and, with much ballyhoo, he cut the film to play out in real time. Dmitri Tiomkin's score is perfectly synchronized, and Tex Ritter's theme song, which sold over a million copies, is so iconic that every singer tackling it since then has rendered a pale imitation.

Zinnemann and Crosby intentionally shot High Noon in stark black and white. Zinnemann valiantly fought to keep media mogul Ted Turner's filthy colorizing hands off the film. Alas, Zinnemann lost and Turner, with Republic Pictures, produced an asinine colorized version for television. Therein lies the difference between celluloid and the corporal world. In the latter, sometimes the bad guys win.

*Due to John Wayne's interpretation of this scene, he and fellow right wing extremist Ward Bond bullied Gary Cooper into backing out of a planned independent production company with Forman and producer Robert Lippert. []

*The American Film Institute lists High Noon second in its list of top ten westerns. First is John Ford's The Searchers (1956) with Wayne. Two other films starring Wayne made the list: Red River at number five and Ford's Stagecoach (1939) at number nine. []

*The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was as hypocritical as Wayne, awarding the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B. DeMille's dreadful The Greatest Show On Earth (1952), in order to appease Joseph McCarthy and the right-wing campaign launched against High Noon. This snub is, justifiably, seen as one of the many examples of the Academy's irrelevancy. []

*Gregory Peck was next offered the role after Wayne refused it. Peck also declined the part, feeling it too closely resembled The Gunfighter (1950), which he had just made. Peck later counted the decision as his biggest career mistake. However, Peck, ever the gentleman, admitted he could not have played the part as well as Cooper. Charlton Heston, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and Kirk Douglas were also offered the role and declined it. []

*Zinnemann and makeup artist Gustaf Norin gave Cooper no makeup in order accentuate the actor's inherent sense of anguish. []

3395460,4,B0016MLIKM,"Made on a low budget on a standard set, Fred Zinnemann (director), Carl Foreman (writer), Elmo Williams and Harry Gerstad (editors) nonetheless thoughtfully ask questions related to human nature in difficult situations as they carefully build tension in this 85-minute 1952 western.  The film broke the mold of superficial all-action westerns that preceded it, having more in common with the taut, realistic and dialogue-driven dramas that were one of the highest forms of achievement from late 40s and early 50s Hollywood (unless they swerved too heavily into melodrama).  The major weakness in this film is the relationship between sheriff Kane, played to stoic perfection by Gary Cooper, and of Amy Kane, portrayed by the much younger Grace Kelly.  It is not the age difference nor the particularities of the acting that fail, but rather relates to the implausibility of them being together in the first place and the consequent detriment to the logic of the plot and theme as the movie unfolds.

The plot is relatively straightforward, but contains several details that are important to note.  Sheriff Kane learns of the prison release and near-term train arrival of the dastardly Frank Miller, a guy he arrested and judge (and jury, we presume, but where are those members?) Mettrick sent to prison a few years ago.  Frank vowed his revenge, we learn as we look at the chair in which he sat upon conviction, and three toughs with which he ran are now in town waiting for Frank to arrive on the Sunday noon train.  When Frank and the boys reunite, they will return to murder Kane and Mettrick.  Kane, by chance, was going to quit as Sheriff the next day, as it so happens he was married that same day, just prior to learning that Miller and the gang (one of whom is played by the squinty and glinty-eyed Lee Van Cleef, already distinctive).  We learn that he married the young blonde and bonneted Quaker Amy Fowler, who arrived in town from who knows where and apparently knows little of Kane's past - and not just the Miller affair.  Will Kane and his new bride start to leave town, but he is overcome with some sort of moral responsibility that, true to the code of the west, he cannot articulate but we understand - Amy does not - and he returns to the fictional Hadleyville, somewhere in the New Mexico territory, to gather volunteer deputies to face the Miller threat.  Significantly and rather absurdly, the Quaker Amy - did she not realize the kind of man he is, did he not realize her strict code of anti-violence? - decides to leave him on the spot because of this decision, vowing to leave on the train that will have just dropped off his would-be killer.

He does not have long to accomplish this.  The film paces itself in near real-time, as Zinnemann provides consistent and periodic shots of large pendulum clocks that seem to be in every room to increase the tension.  Kane and Amy were married around 10:30, the train arrives at noon. We are also periodically provided with low-angle shots of the train track, the tiny depot in the background, creating a sense of the empty loneliness of the place and the situation, particularly, as it turns out, for Will Kane.  In a series of encounters that do not require description - but are repetitively and annoyingly accompanied by the much praised but relatively hokey film score by Dimitri Tiomkin, Kane travels from saloon to church and to a few residences as well in his effort to round up deputies that will help him, but to no avail. Additionally, the film ultimately brings us scenes of the morally and emotionally strong Mexican businesswoman, Helen Ramirez (played brilliantly by the smoldering Katy Jurado), who had been Kane's lover, and the headstrong Quaker, Amy.  Their dialogue and their difference defines the key moral choice involved in this situation - does killing a killer really solve anything, or does evil need to be confronted, violently if necessary, for civilization to progress? We also learn that Amy's brother and father died violently, and we learn that Helen does not much like Kane anymore, though her defense of him to Amy is vigorous.  What fractured the relationship of Helen and Will, the two strongest characters in this little town?  We are left to only guess.

The encounters with the various people in the town are instructive.  While the good God-fearing people of the church initially support deputization enthusiastically, their natural fear, combined with the notion that this, after all, is not their quarrel, allows them to not only back down from supporting Kane, but with Kane's supposed pal, Mayor Jonas Henderson (a solid Thomas Mitchell) leading the way, suggest that Kane leave town pronto to save himself as well as the residents of Hadleyville.  The mayor apparently believes Frank Miller and the gang, who used to raise hell and own the town back in the day, will search fruitlessly and forever for Kane and never come back to disrupt the town.  Such, accurately portrayed, are the justifications of men under great duress.  The owners of the saloon and the hotel are also interesting, but less convincing.  They are apparently concerned only about commerce, and the subdued nature of the town post Kane's vanquish of the Miller gang has left them with less business volume - though the saloon sure seems pretty busy for a Sunday morning. I guess that old notion of a stable community, allowing for the influx of those middle-class capabilities and yearnings and dollars has somehow not paid off for these businessmen, who would rather have drunken brawlers and shoot-ups drive the local economic engine.  In any event, there is no support for Kane in town, not even from his hot-headed erstwhile deputy Pell, a role unconvincingly written and impatiently portrayed by Lloyd Bridges, whose distrust of Kane is not authentically developed by writer, director or actor.

When the moment of truth arrives, the critical decisive action is that taken by Amy, apparently motivated by love and persuaded by Helen.  It is heavily foreshadowed in the shootout scene, but nonetheless leaves us believing that she does in fact have the American pragmatic moral conviction, most specifically that of the West, her clever-sounding but weak-kneed non-violent idealism left wanting in the face of the hard realities of life.  The film contains thoughtful suggestions of both the ugly blacklist era, of which writer Carl Foreman was a victim, depicted in the isolation experienced by the Kane and those who refused to testify against peers in the rush to judge who was truly American and not, and of the lessons of World War II, in which pacific notions of isolation and a willingness to dance away from the horrors of the early forties were not consonant with what was required to save free societies.  Because of those well-conceived and convincingly-portrayed ideas, High Noon is a commendable film worth viewing more than once.  If only Zinnemann and Foreman would have provided some scenes to explain the manner in which Will and Amy incongruously came together, why Helen and Will broke apart and even the antagonism between Will and deputy Pell - while still providing the foundation for the elucidation of those worthy themes - one might regard it as a master parable for postwar America.  Perhaps they worried that the sense of tension would be lost by including such explanatory scenes, but 15 minutes added to this relatively short film in the context of what the viewer knows is to come at the end might actually have enriched, rather than diminished, the climax.

3395475,5,B0016MLIKM,"I cant tell you how many times Ive seen this movie.  What makes High Noon so good?  First of all it is an American Western of the best kind.  But High Noon is more than a Western, it is a great movie, so much so that I rank this movie in the top three of all time.

 The plot involves a longtime marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) of Hadleyville in the New Mexico Territory who has recently retired after his marriage to Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) who happens to be a Quaker.  The story goes that as Kane was ready to leave when he was informed on Sunday morning that the train due in at 12:00 noon had old nemeses Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) a criminal whom Kane brought to justice years ago.  In fact Miller was to be hanged for his crimes but due to legal technicalities his sentence was changed and he was subsequently released.

 Kane was told by all his friends and some enemies in fact that he should take his leave with his new bride.  Kane refuses to budge and does not go and he considers this as unfinished and a matter of personal honor that he confront not only Miller but three of his sidekicks who are in fact waiting at the Hadleyville railroad station for the arrival of Miller.

 As the story develops further we see Kane trying to gather deputies to combat these four gunmen and of course he finds that many of his friends are not about to put themselves in harms way.  It is at this time in the movie when the props of the clock ticking and the sounds of a train whistle charging forward to the railroad station take on a haunting meaning.

 The movie is not just a great Western, but tells a greater story about how a man faces a crisis when everyone including his wife abandons him.  As the clocks ticks and the whistle blows to the inevitable showdown there is the greatest scene in film history as the camera fades up and over Kane as he walks to face the four gunmen.  This shot alone stands tall in filmmaking history.

 This is not just a great Western but a great film for all ages!",1385856000,,2006,4.245382585751979

3395480,5,B0016MLIKM,"This traditional western with its iconic title is the best American movie ever made, both cinematically and culturally.

Cinematically, the movie enhances the suspense by using its now famous techniques of the ticking clock and the empty railway station waiting for the main criminal to arrive.  Gary Cooper does a great job in playing the stoical marshal.  The realism is enhanced by accidental events such as when the marshal and the criminals confront each other.  The music adds to the effect by employing a catchy theme song instead of an overbearing orchestra.

But the main effect of the movie is cultural.  The movie evokes a mythical past of the lone American hero confronting evil.  In real life many of the townspeople, if not most, would have supported the marshal.  But the rugged individualism the movie portrays is a part of American culture that is rapidly disappearing.

There is also a romantic subplot where the marshal resists his new bride's nagging to leave town and this may have been the last time any man in America was able to resist any nagging.  The new bride initially leaves but then returns and helps the marshal kill the criminals at the very end.

Today individualism is being replaced by group identity where the favored groups are race (except white), gender (except male), sexual orientation (except heterosexual), religion (except Christianity), and ethnicity (except European).",1384387200,,1415,5.108695652173913

3395487,5,B0016MLIKM,"Viewing the 60th-Anniversary Edition on DVD in clear, crisp B&W on a 50"" plasma TV is a joy.  It also reveals things I never noticed before.
  Historically, May-December marriages were common.  I have no story problem with an older man (Kane) marrying a young woman (Amy) here.
  A poster in Kane's office, near the front door, is an ever-present portent of what's coming:  ""War is Declared--President Calls For 75,000 Volunteers.""
  Kane is ambidextrous!  He uses only one gun, but shoots Colby with his left hand and later Frank Miller with his right.  (No wonder he's the best marshal they ever had.)
  Despite some grumpy viewers' preferences, Kane would NEVER step on that badge after dropping it in the dirt.  He's spent the last hour-and-a-half defending what it stands for!  Kane is a man of integrity.  When Trumbull, in church, asks why he doesn't arrest the other three gunmen now, Kane's reply says it all:  They haven't done anything wrong.  He can't arrest them for sitting at the depot.  Kane upholds the LAW.  Let someone with INTEGRITY pick up that badge.
  Finally, that buckboard question.  If Amy's bags were loaded aboard the train, how can they be present at the end?  Answer: they WEREN'T.  Look again.  When Amy drives past Kane at high noon, with Helen Ramirez beside her, the back is loaded with BOTH women's bags--Helen's on top, Amy's covered by a tarp.  The stationmaster loads HELEN'S bags aboard the train.  But, hearing the opening gunfire, Amy bolts off the train and runs into town to find Kane.  We may rationalize the stationmaster wouldn't load her bags if she's staying behind, so they're still on the buckboard when the train pulls out with Helen aboard.  And that's why they're still present at the end.",1378080000,,1743,4.829931972789115

My experience with the film began as a child while accompanying my parents to a regular Wednesday night film at the theater in the early 50s. Cowboy movies were always my favorites and although ""High Noon"" had a more mature story line then a eight year old could fully understand, I came away realizing I had seen something special. My parents talked in glowing terms about the movie all the way home while I sat listening in the back seat of the car. Over the intervening decades I viewed the film at least a half dozen times and have always enjoyed it. It has a simple straight forward story line and the strength of the film is built with the strong acting ability of the entire cast.

Then wait for the last bad guy to get off the train and then plug him? And all the townspeople, many who were Civil War vets or fought Indians, and Cooper can't find one to help him? A western town in frontier days full of cowards? I know the standard plot device for many westerns was the lone hero against the bad guys showing up the cowardly townspeople. Baloney. The movie is just too dull and unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of old westerns, and I know how unrealistic most of the plot devices are in those movies. Still, I can't watch  High Noon without becoming irritated very quickly by the lack of common sense. Come on Coop, stroll down to the train depot with your Winchester, plug the three baddies sitting in chairs and stewed to the gills. Then wait until Frank Miller gets off the train and plug him.

3395499,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper's finest role is that of Marshal Will Kane in the classic Western High Noon.

This movie is an extremely simple story.  Marshal Kane sent a gang of evil desperados off to hang.  However, their sentences were commented due to a legal technicality.  These men are returning on the Noon Train to seek vengeance against the Marshal & his town.

Thus Marshal Kane must face the situation.  This however is where the suspense starts.  The evil gang is not doing anything illegal-yet, and Kane has also just gotten married and is about to leave town.  His wife is wholly against him getting involved in such an event.  Despite these problems, Kane decides to save his town.

The story plays out in real time and clocks are shown throughout.  Kane struggles to find supporters, in one ironic scene he interrupts a church singing The Battle Hymn of the Republic to find backup.  The church congregation decides to sit out the fight.  This theme plays out, nobody in town wants to take up the fight to resist evil.  This moral equivocating heightens the suspense and creates a movie that is worth remembering.

A great Western Classic.",1374192000,,1137,4.758974358974359
3395500,5,B0016MLIKM,"We are dealing with a town that was run by the Frank Miller gang.  Despite murders and lawlessness, certain unsavory elements preferred Miller to Kane who with the help of several deputies, cleaned up the town.  As Marshal, Kane was disliked by many (some who preferred Miller).  The movie opens with Frank Miller, who had been condemned to death - being pardoned and the four main members of the gang going after Kane.  Afterward, they would presumably run the town.  (SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)  Kane and his newlywed wife are sent out of town to protect them.  Kane speculates that even if they evade Miller, somehow Miller will find him wherever he goes.  He figures that he can get deputies and track down the four.  His wife wonders why he is making it his fight rather than letting others deal with Miller.  The new marshal is due the next day.  Those who want Miller stopped don't want to fight the gang of four.  No one realizes that once you have enough people, there will be no fight.  The deputy is willing to fight if Kane puts in a good word for him.  Kane believes he is too immature.  If had had agreed, there would have been at least three people.  Some of the towns people believe that stopping Miller through a gunfight will make the town less hospitable to investors.  Illogic galore.  Those who won't deal with Miller will be conquered by him.  At the end, it is Kane alone against the others.  Earlier he refused to arrest the three others because that would be unlawful, even though he dooms the town.  What if the others were put in jail and Miller too?  Probably they would talk about their plans and could be put in jail.  In any event we see a whole town where the anti-Miller side is afraid of FOUR men.  Many looked for twelve men to go after Miller's four.  A  town full of cowards and idiots.  Kane's inability to work with people made it impossible for him to win converts.  Matt Dillon, he is not.

3395508,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is an American classic that has stood the test of time. If you can accept or ignore the unlikely premise that the populace of a post-Civil War western town would cower at the approach of four thugs, the film is immensely enjoyable, packed with fine performances, skillful direction and artful photography. The fast-paced action is facilitated by the real-time presentation, wherein the entire storyline takes place in just the 85 minutes depicted on the screen. And then there's the music by Hollywood veteran Dimitri Tiomkin, one of the most spare and iconic movie scores of all time, and one of the most effective. The Academy Award winning score includes the song ""Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling"", with lyrics by Ned Washington. This simple but haunting melody is sung by Tex Ritter, and recurs throughout the film.

The Olive Films 2012 Blu-ray release of the 1952 movie offers a noticeable improvement in both video and audio as compared to the Republic Pictures DVD releases of 2001 and 2002. However, considering its niche-market price and its dearth of special features (just the Leonard Maltin making-of video and a theatrical trailer, and no subtitles) this release is only for those who really love the film, or do not yet have a DVD version. And if you do have the DVD hang on to it, because it has more special features than does the new Blu-ray.

Gary Cooper won his second Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Town Marshal Will Kane, in a performance featuring many close-ups of his craggy and expressive face. The emotional impact of this film is enormous, concentrated by the black-and-white photography, compact running time, unobtrusive musical score, and consistently fine acting.

The film tells the story of Marshall Will Kane who is willing to face his foes even when no one else will help him. Gary Cooper plays the newlywed lawman who must flee town or face the killer coming on the noon train. He resolves to do just that despite the pleas of his loving wife. The sheriff scrambles against the clock to get help. However no one is brave enough to face the enemy with him. Even with the odds against him he faces them in a showdown.

So I expected some real magic here. But the film is really very simple. A very good character study and a film that doesn't depend on action and violence to tell it's story. The entire film is building it's way up to an unavoidable showdown that Gary Cooper's character will face. It's about honor and duty. While cooper is the epitome of the classic hero, he's also unsure of him self, scared, and desperately looking for some men to join him as deputies to take on a ruthless man he had put away years before that was just released from prison and will arrive on a train at twelve noon in this small town, looking for some payback. Cooper's character has plenty of chances to leave town but he doesn't. Even his wife can't convince him to leave. The idea is that he's determined to stand for his town no matter what the cost even though he's truly freightened. The acting is great and production values are not something special like an Orson Welles sort of thing, but very good. Other than that this film is sort of dull and uneventful. By the time the showdown happens it isn't like I was expecting at all. Cooper doesn't bravely stand in the middle of the town square like so many westerns have their heroes do, but instead cooper creeps around and hides and takes each bad guy out one at a time. I found the film marginally interesting but wonder what all the praise is about. I can't understand why it's a classic. I wasn't tremendously impressed with Citizen Kane either, and it's considered the greatest movie ever made. While I do agree that film is a classic and a masterpiece I just don't think it should be at the number one spot.

First the story line, or argument, The scene selection and composition handling are so precise, and the spot angle or wiew spot are achieved for the best setting the story fluency and adding the acomplisshed editing work, that in those days was very different, not digitalized for the easy scene formulation.
If we add the actors achievement in his acting, the music and the real time progress intended on the line, is for me difficult to think in other film that get this sum of hits.

The dilemma faced by Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) between personal morals, civic duty, and personal fears makes this a fascinating drama. Interestingly the townsfolk, of which most proclaim him the best marshal they've ever had, fail to back him in his time of need. Will Kane's newly married pacifist Quaker wife (Grace Kelly) struggles with her personal fears and whether to abandon her husband in the face of his obstinate stand for law and order on the day of his resignation as marshal, and the start of his new life.

Gary Cooper is too old for the character he is cast to play.  He would have been more believable in the role the marshall's teacher played by Lon Chaney, than the marshall.  He is most definitely too old to be cast as a newlywed to the amazing and timeless beauty and talent of Grace Kelly - who is also wasted in this movie in such a small, barely supporting role capacity.

The film's ONLY redeeming quality is that it takes place almost in real time.  We know the train carrying the villain arrives at ""High Noon"" and it is approximately 10:30am the wedding services are finishing - leaving us approximately 90 minutes to build the suspense of the arrival of Frank Miller (the villain),

With the exception of some minor subplots along the way, that is all that we spend the next 90minutes doing - building suspense that leads to one of the most anti-climactic ""gunfight"" endings in the history of the western.",1361836800,,1157,4.39906103286385

3395544,4,B0016MLIKM,"The movie ""High Noon"" is a western about a man named Will Cain, who has to protect his town from a man he sent up the river, but gets off for an unknown reason. The movie starts off with Will and a woman named Amy getting married. When it cuts to the train station and three men are asking about the noon train. The train station man runs and tells Will. Will is leaving that night and retiring, but now that the man named Frank Miller is coming to town, Will decides to stay. Frank will be coming into town on the noon train, so Will has until then to raise a posse. There is only one problem, nobody will support the marshall with his mission to protect the town from Frank Miller. His deputy quits on him because he appointed an out-of-town marshall instead of him, the people in town (mostly at the bar) tell him that they will not help him because Frank is thier friend, and the people at the church tell him that they won't help fight a battle that he can avoid by just leaving town like he was going to anyways with his wife, who threatened to leave him because he wouldn't leave with her. Will is all alone and scrambling the whole movie until Frank shows up with the three boys of his crew, and start searching for Will. They start fighting, and Will kills one, then Will runs into a barn. Frank sets the barn on fire, but Will gets out on the side of a horse. He then runs into a little shop, and he kills another one of Franks boys. His wife, Amy, kills one of them and then gets taken hostage by Frank. He gets Will to come out, Amy bites Frank and gets away, then will shoots him. End of the movie basically. Very slow build and not much action, but I still enjoyed this movie.

3395545,4,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" was one of the top movies of the Twentieth Century, with not only bringing in fans of the western genre, but fans of drama, it is the perfect mix. With Fred Zinnemann leading the production as the director, who was known for his unique style of dramas, this movie was meant to be a hit.

 Will Kane, who is the longtime marshal of Hadleyville, which is located somewhere in the New Mexico territory, just married a pacifist Quaker Amy Fowler and gave up his dangerous job of being the marshal of this western town. By turning in his badge, he chooses to become a storekeeper of a shop elsewhere. But suddenly, the town he once protected has learned that Frank Miller- a vicious criminal who the ex marshal once before brought to justice- is arriving on the noon train. Then Will Kane must head back into Hadleyville to protect his former friends and neighbors from this criminal who is seeking revenge on Kane and the townspeople with his three gang members.

 This movie, which is set in real time, enhances your movie experience by you the viewer and the characters in the story learning everything together. Such as when Kane and the former criminal, Frank Miller, are closing closer and closer to one another, there are no cuts in time, you are there to witness everything in the full nail-biting eighty-five minutes.

 But, this is not the perfect movie. There are very few flaws, like the one I witnessed every once in a while was some of the actors could have been a bit sharper around the edges. Such as when Kane visits Frank Miller's first lover, Helen Ramirez, she could have been a lot better. She seemed to be very mono toned and did not show many emotions in her parts.

 All in all, this was a very impressive film considering the age and technology that was present at the time. Good job Freddy Z.",1357171200,,1825,4.5426829268292686

3395552,3,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper stars as Will Kane in Fred Zinnemann's Academy-award winning movie, 'High Noon'. The story begins with the former town Marshall's marriage to his Quaker wife, Amy, played by Grace Kelly.  Shortly thereafter he is told that Frank Miller, a criminal whom he had arrested, has been pardoned and is arriving on the twelve o'clock train to kill him. The newlyweds start to leave town, but Will's conscience makes him turn around to protect his town and honor.
  Cinematically, 'High Noon' was a good movie.  It was filmed in real time; Zinnemann's frequent shots of clocks create a sense of urgency as Will hurries to find men who will support him. The opening credits feature the song ""Do not forsake me'"" which won the 1952 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Not only did it set the tone for the movie, it also provided characterization for Will with lyrics like ""I only know I must be brave...or lie a coward, a craven coward.""
 Throughout the movie Will is faced with defending his reputation versus making his wife happy by not resorting to violence. Masculinity's importance is shown by Will risking his life to preserve his pride. Another important theme is age; Harvey, a young friend who hopes to become Sheriff, is seen as immature and inexperienced. After not being promoted, Harvey starts drinking. The bartender tells Harvey that he's doing the smart thing by not getting involved; this makes Harvey realize he doesn't want to do the reasonable thing- he wants to prove his masculinity.  Amy shows her age when trying to understand why Will refused to leave town. She comes to the conclusion that it is because of another woman, Helen. Helen points out Amy's immaturity by her not realizing that Will is a proud man who has to defend himself.
 'High Noon' is a classic Western movie recommended by some as ""a western movie for people who don't like westerns."" Running under 90 minutes, it's an ideal film for those who are interested in the western genre or who just want to see a classic film.",1356048000,,2017,4.762177650429799
3395553,4,B0016MLIKM,"The movie, ""High Noon"" illustrated one man's courage and personal code of honor, the traits that should be imminent in any and all lawmen. In this movie, it shows the corruption and how cowardly the town's people are and how in desperate need of a hero they are. Although they kept trying to kick Gary Cooper out, he ignores every excuse, overcomes his human fear of death and does the right thing. This movie shows how this could have really happened because there was no stupid standoff were he kills them all luckily. No instead it shows how someone would truly fight when outnumbered 4 to 1, through hit-and-run tactics and surprise attacks, picking one off at a time. Now even though this movie is outdated with its music choice, movie theatrics, and old movie ""magic,"" it makes up for that through story and moral teachings. A lot of modern day directors believe that just a bunch of explosions and raw action can make a good movie. They are clearly proven wrong with this movie. This movie is over 50 years old and still remains a highly rated movie and maintains about a $20 value which is what most new movies cost when they first come out. Through this you can conclude that the movie was so good, because it had not lost any of its value. To quote Sanpete, ""this true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors."" This statement could not be more on point in describing what this movie is about in a nutshell.

3395566,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"", number 2 on the AFI top 10 Westerns of all time, comes to Blu-ray disc in fine form. The remastering is not quite to the level of the 70th Anniversary edition of ""Casablanca"", yet this 60 year old, low budget, black and white movie looks and sounds very fine. Young folks of today, looking for 5.1 multichannel, will find a fine, if not quite perfect, DTS HD Master 1.0 audio. That is, mono was how most movies were originally seen at the time, and the audio well drives the movie story telling of ""High Noon"".

The movie opens with academy award winning original song, ""Do not Forsake me Oh My Darlin' "", sung by Tex Ritter, and we slowly close in on a young Lee Van Cleef, whom younger viewers surely recall from ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"". In a sense, ""High Noon"" is a spiritual predecessor of modern western films, advancing beyond the previous formula of good guy vs. bad guy; good guy prevails. Soon after the opening and credits, we come to the scene where Oscar winner Gary Cooper's character, Marshall Will Cane, is marrying a Quaker woman, a young Grace Kelly. The marshall is also about to retire; note the essential conflict between non-violent Quaker belief and the use of guns by a Marshall in the wild west. Likewise, there is conflict between the retiring marshall's duty to the town, his personal values, and whether to protect [the town]. A pardoned killer is returning on the noon train, who previously swore vengeance against some of the pillars of the town. The marriage takes place about 10:30, and the action proceeds towards noon in an approximate real time fashion, with prominent clock motifs propelling the action and suspense - who will help the Marshall, who will leave town, who will live or die.

Not only is the movie excellent in itself, but the presence of young actors who would later go on to fame is also interesting. To punctuate this, there is a fine extra about the making of the movie where we find out movie making details and some of the ""high Noon"" legacies in show business today, from Tex Ritter to John Ritter and more. Who would have thought of a ""Crosby, Stills and Nash"" connection to ""High Noon""? As well, aspects of the House Un-American Committee [the movie came out in 1952, the McCarthy era] are briefly discussed. A most worthy movie on any of its multiple levels - movie itself, Western movie history, young actors later famous for varying things, including Princess Grace of Monaco, and the complexities of human interactions given the different, conflicting and complex points of view of the various characters in  the film.",1343952000,,2603,4.691466083150985
3395567,5,B0016MLIKM,"There is not much more that can be said about ""High Noon"". Film critics and film historians as well as other directors have all called it one of the greatest films of all time(#27) according to the latest AFI survey. Another AFI survey ranked Gary Cooper's portrayal of Marshall Will Kane as the #5 film hero of all time(Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockinbird"" was voted #1). The film was made on a small budget($730,000) and had a 28 day shooting schedule. Written by Carl Foreman, produced by Stanley Kramer and directed by the great Fred Zinnemann, it can rightly be called a classic. I have owned every version of the film starting with the 40th Anniversary VHS from 1992 and the 50th Anniversary DVD Collector's Edition from 2002, both put out by Republic. I've never liked the picture quality of either of these, particularly the 2002 DVD Edition. When I heard that Paramount Pictures had purchased the Republic catalog my hopes were that they would release a Blu-ray edition in time for ""High Noon's"" 60th Anniversary in 2012. Paramount is releasing it's Republic catalog thru Olive Films for all their blu ray releases and ""High Noon"" is one of the first. I finally received it yesterday in the mail and watched it last night. Then I did a comparison with the 2002 Dvd edition. To be honest, there is no comparison. Olive Films has done a superb job with this edition and ""High Noon"" has never looked better. I was worried at first because this is my first experience with Olive Films. All that worry was in vain because this is the best version of ""High Noon"" in any format that I've ever seen. I won't go over the plot of the film. Nearly every film buff knows the story by now. Let's just say that this new blu ray version brings out the tension in all the characters even more. The close-ups of Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Katy Jurado, Lloyd Bridges and the rest of the cast are amazing in blu ray. I recently bought the blu ray of ""To Catch a Thief"" and not only does does Grace Kelly look beautiful in color, but looks even better in black and white. You can also feel all the emotion and pain in Cooper's face. Admittedly, he was really in pain during the shooting suffering from a bleeding ulcer. But he deservedly won the Best Actor Academy Award that year for his fine performance. Fred Zinnemann probably had something to do with that. He was an underrated director(along with Michael Curtiz) and very rarely gets mentioned when anyone talks about the great Hollywood directors. But the facts are certainly there. Pictures that Zinnemann directed amassed a total of 65 Academy Award nominations with 24 wins! He directed actors that appeared in his films to a total of nineteen Oscar nominations. It's remarkable because he didn't direct that many films compared to some of today's directors like Steven Speilberg, Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood.

This manifest contempt by the studio for a large segment of the home video market is especially amazing considering that my DVD version of High Noon has closed captions. Has thumbing their noses at millions of cinephiles who want the option, for varied reasons, of turning on English subtitles or closed captions, now become standard operating procedure at Olive Films? My hearing is still fine, but my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to catch all the dialog. Besides, my hearing won't always be perfect, and I strongly empathize with the plight of those with impaired hearing. So I intend to wait until a decent studio offers a decent blu-ray version of this magnificent western.",1343001600,,956,4.98125

Not so much a western as a striking morality play excellently acted, directed and produced - on a shoestring $700k budget in stark black and white. Supposedly a Carl Foreman allegory on HUAC targeted victims. Katy Jurado steals the show and was robbed of an Oscar.  I suppose that she is technically the female lead as she appears before Grace Kelly in the cast. Both were unknown before this film. Excellent supporting cast with Thomas Mitchell, the original Wolf Man Lon Chaney Jr., Harry Morgan,and Lloyd Bridges. The director, Fred Zinnemann is right up there with David Lean and Stephen Spielberg with films like this and 'A Man For All Seasons', 'Day Of The Jackal', 'Oklahoma!', 'From Here To Eternity', 'The Nun's Story', 'A Member Of The Wedding' and 'Julia'.

3395579,4,B0016MLIKM,"I just finished watching Olive Film's Blu-ray release of High Noon, and the movie is still as suspenseful today as it was when released in 1952.  Using the film's running time in actual time adds to the urgency and growing desperation of Sheriff Will Kane as the clock ticks closer to noon when he will be in a duel with four men on the streets of the town he feels a moral responsibility to single-handedly protect.

It is quite well known that Gary Cooper was very ill with an ulcer problem during the making of the film, and that certainly added to his performance, for which he won his second Oscar (the first was for Sergeant York).  The almost visibly shaking of a man deserted by his friends to face four deadly killers is best reflected in his eyes, nervous but trying not to appear that way to others.

The Blu-ray is definitely superior to the previous DVD release.  It is extremely sharp, and I find it hard to believe it even looked this good on the original movie screen.

Audio, on the other hand, is where the Blu from Olive comes up way short.  They have chosen a mono audio that plays only on a center speaker.  I prefer the choice of an enhanced audio on the original DVD.

Also, the extras are, unfortunately, not all brought over from the DVD.  I realize Olive Films is infamous for having no extras on their Blu releases, and I guess we should be happy that we did get a documentary on the making of the movie from the previous DVD release, but there were others on that DVD release it would have been nice to get (a commentary and another documentary about the film).

This is not an allegory regarding politics or anything characteristic of modern times or unique to the harsh realities of the western frontier.

True heroes are never sterotypical but ordinary men put under extraordinary circumstances and simply respond in any way necessary even within a very real probability that he may not survive the ordeal.

3395597,1,B0016MLIKM,"Oh, my.

I wanted to see this because, essentially, it's a good story: A man fights for what is right despite the ambivalence of a town and the betrayal of beliefs by the town's upright citizens.

And I wanted to see the ""High Noon"" remake just to get away from that AWFUL and continual use of the original movie's tune almost every 30 seconds.

But this modern-day version is odious for many reasons.
Among them:
*The laughable and community-theater acting skills of all of the characters except Tom Skerritt. He does a capable job and collects his money and left on the noon train.
*The also laughable wardrobe of its characters. The new sheriff who is to take over Will Kane's (Skerritt's) job is outfitted in what can kindly be called a Hong Kong knockoff of a plastic faux leather coat. The bad guy/leader of the gang out to kill Kane is attired in a Dolce & Gabanna black outfit with what seems to be silk scarves around his neck. THIS GUY HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM A WESTERN PRISON!!! Did he stop off at a Chicago haberdashery before he comes to town to kill the sheriff and the judge?
As for costumes, the town seems divided along these lines: The well-attired townsfolks and the scraggly cowboy types. Thee is no middle ground. Either well-heeled or badly-heeled.
*Maria Conchita Alonso is laughable in her accented western English. The lines by most cast members seem delivered as if they are reading from a slow teleprompter. The men all seem to have shaved just before the cameras started rolling. Clean citizens, they are.

Susanna Thompson (the sheriff's new wife) seeems to be a refugee from the soap opera school of acting. Her lines are without real emotion and flat.
The telegraph operator seems to be another refugee but from the bad 1950s school of western acting. He's laughably skittish, skinny and always seems to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown.

Come on!
If you're gonna remake a classic, at least make an attempt at making a good product. Here's a hint: It was made by TBS Superstation, the credit says. No wonder.

At the end of the movie I pined for the classic. I even pined to hear that awful movie tune of the original playing every 30 seconds or so. This western needs to die a quick death. Either that or somebody get the sheriff to put me out of my cinematic misery.",1324425600,,2308,4.56280193236715

The comparison of Grace Kelly with a stagecoach is of course metaphoric, though she actually feels like having unlimited energy in keeping to her pacifist point; that, when she inadvertedly finds herself near the centre of action, she of course, Western ethic, vitally supports her husband goes without saying. One of the film's attraction was originally that it is one of the few real time movies in film history - ie it starts with the news of the arrival of the bandits by noon train about twenty to eleven and finishes by about seven minutes past noon.

3395603,5,B0016MLIKM,"A classic film that was not well received by its audiences (for not fitting the Western archetype with chases, lots of gunfights and epic scenery) but which was later recognized as AFI's 2007 list of great films. Eisenhower and Clinton cited this picture as their favorite film of all time and the latter is cited as having screened this one 17 times at the White House. Some might call that irony. The tale focused upon a newlywed sheriff torn between the love for his pacifist wife and his duty to stop some baddies coming into town. He decides that duty wins and goes about trying to get help from a mostly ambivalent town. Many considered this film to be an allegory of the Hollywood blacklisting of the old days. John Wayne was cited as calling this film ""Un-American"" and teamed up with Howard Hawkes to film RIO LOBO as a conservative response. Producer Carl Foreman was later blacklisted by Hollywood. When the Academy Awards came about and this movie lost it created one of the greatest uproars and many believed this was a way to appease Senator McCarthy who was hunting for Communists in Hollywood. Gary Cooper won an Oscar for Best Actor but was not there to receive it because of all the controversy. Ironically, John Wayne received it on behalf of Cooper. The film seemed to take the stance that pacifism is only useful up to a certain degree. The character's choice of a wife seemed strange compared to his former mistress who was more like him but then opposites sometimes attract (and a pretty white blonde is going to get more people in the seat than a minority woman I suspect for those times). Mexican actress Katy Jurado picked up Best Supporting Actress from the Golden Globves for her role and was thus the first Mexican American to ever win such an award.

3395616,5,B0016MLIKM,"There are innumerable imitations of this classic since its debut in 1952, which is testament to the power of its story and its telling. I was only four, so if my dad took me to this movie, I don't remember. However, I have seen it many times--and I don't tire of the story: Will Kane's (Gary Cooper) battle with fear and conscience. ""Am I a coward?"" is a question everyman asks when facing evil. In the end, Will is successful in facing this nemesis.

Their are so many big stars in this movie: Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado have the prime roles. Bad guys Ian MacDonald, Robert Wilke, Lee Van Cleef, and Sheb Wooley are menacing. The town folk are thoroughly convincing in their different excuses, underpinning Kane's plight. These actors include Thomas Mitchell, Otto Kruger, Eve McVeagh, Harry Morgan, and Lon Chaney, Jr. Howland Chamberlain acting is brilliant as the vengeful hotel clerk who wishes harm to Marshal Kane. Jack Elam also has a tiny bit part as one of two town drunks released before the final showdown.

3395619,5,B0016MLIKM,"Most reviews focus on the inner-turmoil/conflict of Gary Cooper's character and how he deals with this inner-turmoil/conflict; however, many reviews neglect completely to consider the extreme moral conflict experienced by the Grace Kelley character. Obviously, Cooper is THE star of the film while Kelley was still basically a new-comer to films. It has to be remembered that Kane's life has been one in which violence/death has been a major component.  His moral conflict is significantly different from that of his new wife. Kane is a world-weary realist who has no pretenses about the harsh, ugly, and often brutal realities of the world. On the other hand, his young and idealistic wife who was raised in the cloistered Quaker community has yet to see the extremely gross underside of humanity. She doesn't yet realize that survival is often based on violence; and that violence is the only ""language"" some people understand.

I'm of the school of thought that Kelley's character experiences a greater moral dilemma than that of Kane. She is forced to completely abandon her beliefs, code of ethics, and self-sacrificing mentality to save the life of the man she loves--both a noble and self-serving act. She is painted into a corner by circumstances in which she is forced to make agonizing life-choices; trying desperately to adhere to religious beliefs that involve the denial of self. Like Kane at the start of the film who can't run away and live with himself, Kelley's character can't run away at the end of the film and live with herself.  She has to go back and have her own personal showdown.

Because Cooper gets the bulk of screen-time, the viewer has a tendency to forget about Kelley's character and what's churning inside her. BOTH Kane and Kelley's character experience parallel conflicts/choices basically alone. Kelley's character is--in some ways--more alone because she is a stranger to the town. She has no one to turn to for counsel, except Kane's former romantic interest. What a terrible spot to be in. Cooper's and Kelley's characters validate the observation that most of life's toughest decisions are made alone.",1295481600,,2142,5.094017094017094

3395623,4,B0016MLIKM,"Critically, as the film was innovative in its structure (avoiding most real Western  `action' until the end of the film), and avoided a number of stereotypes popularized by higher profile filmmakers like John Ford and Howard Hawks, and Western icon John Wayne, derided it as un-American, as well as worse things. That is has become so lauded, even as it was a low budget project, with almost no great nor spectacular battle scenes, is another reason so many of the classic Western film lovers have railed at it. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby does a good, if not spectacular, job. There is one infamous goof that he and film editors committed, and that is in a crane shot, late in the film, where the camera pulls back and up to reveal the town deserted and Kane alone. Unfortunately, in the upper left hand corner of the film, telephone poles and wires are clearly visible. Crosby's mot notable touch was in not fetishizing the Western tableaux, instead not filtering the light reflected from the surroundings, which led to a blanched, dessicated look to the black and white cinematography; along the lines of then contemporary documentary films.

  The DVD, put out by Lionsgate, comes with two disks. Disk one is in a 4:3 aspect ratio, and the transfer is spotless. The remastering of the film is superb. It scintillates with clarity. It also includes an audio commentary by the progeny of many of the people involved- the late actor, John Ritter, Carl Foreman's son, Jonathan, Fred Zinneman's son, Tim, and Gary Cooper's daughter, Maria Cooper-Janis. As in most commentaries featuring non-experts, this one quickly descends into meaningless banter and anecdotes, and many, `Gee, whiz, wasn't dad great' moments. The only comment of any worth comes when it's mentioned that, before he kills the first of the desperadoes, Kane calls out Miller's name, and shorts the man, therefore not plugging him in the back. The comment states this displays Kane's personal code of ethics, and while this is true, it is also one of the weaker moments in the film, because it goes against many of the other realistic moments (as does the plethora of 1950s-speak: Gollys and Gee whizzes abound)- a fact unmentioned in the commentary. But, good observations as this are rare on the track. Given the film's stature as a Western classic, one would have hoped for at least one expert commentary, by a noted historian of cinema. The second disk features a 50 minute making of film, Inside High Noon, and a shorter making of featurette. There is a featurette on singer Tex Ritter; a clip of Ritter singing the Oscar winning song Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin' on the Jimmy Dean tv show, a featurette called Behind High Noon, and a radio broadcast featuring Ritter. All of these features are useful, but none is really standout, nor top of the line, compared to the best DVD features. The real killer, as mentioned, is no expert commentary track.

  High Noon is certainly a classic, and with a few better decisions scriptwise and characterwise, and with a few better decisions technically, it would truly have been a great film. Greatness and classicality, however, are unrelated beasts. This film is classic melodrama stripped to its naked rot, and plays out almost like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. Its narrative bears down upon the viewer like the train that carries Frank Miller. It has moments of poignancy (see the looks between Kane and Helen), black humor (see when the hotel clerk asks Kane if he can find Helen's room when the marshal ascends the stairs), and mythos (scan the characters' names and personal traits for counterparts in assorted mythologies); as well as an ability to amplify these characteristics (note how every shot of the clocks, which visually builds tension, is accompanied by a slightly strumming sound). Technically, the film is top notch, but its fundamentals sag a bit. If only the bulk of films today could display such vices and virtues, what a wonderfully mortal art the masses could wallow in.",1282780800,,4031,4.9017595307917885

Howard Hawks and John Wayne hated this movie and made Rio Bravo as a right-wing response to blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman and the film's message to Hollywood for the failure of the Hollywood people to stand up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era.  Wayne and Hawks hated that Will Kane ran around town like a ""chicken with his head cut off.""  Wayne's political views aside, the plot stands up.  Spineless townspeople is a Western staple, Kane could not run away because the killer would catch up to him and kill his new wife, too (is it really so terrible that the hero is not super-human?).  So, after calling in favors that didn't come through, he stands alone in one of the most famous shots in cinematic history (the crane shot of Kane standing alone in the middle of the street).

Cooper's performance as Will Kane, initially calm and assured about how to face his crisis, but increasingly nervous and hunted as he learns he must face it alone, is brilliant.

It is said that John Wayne (and some others) disapproved of the ending, where Will Kane takes off his badge and tosses it into the dust of the street ... feeling that it showed disrespect for the law and was unpatriotic.

I got something completely different from that act. It was clear to me that the character, who had been the town Marshall and protected these people for so long, was unequivocally separating himself from those who had betrayed him when he was the one needing help. It had nothing to do with the badge ... everything to do with demonstrating his disgust towards his fair weather friends.",1277510400,,1082,4.590673575129534

3395655,5,B0016MLIKM,"That's a simple western film, just before the renaissance of the genre with Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone and a few others. It is a classic of that period (1952) and in a way a turning point. A criminal was caught and sent to prison because one marshal and the population of a township did what they had to do. The criminal should have hanged but some law from Washington changed the game and he only got five years of prison. Five years later he comes back to kill those who had tried to have him hanged. The town learns about it when they see three of his associates come for the noon train, and it is confirmed by telegraph that the criminal, a certain Miller, is on the train. The city has a little more than one hour to do what they can to solve the problem. The marshal had just gotten married thirteen minutes earlier and he was to leave on his honeymoon and he was no longer the marshal and a new marshal was arriving on the following day only, slightly too late. The marshal comes back to assume the situation. He tries to get six deputies and the only he gets are a family man with two kids (he volunteers because he is convinced many more are going to come and he will step back when he finds out no one else has volunteered), then a one-eyed saloon customer who does not realize he is not fit for it, and a fourteen year old boy who is definitely too young and untrained. All the others refuse and even ask him to leave for Miller to do nothing. His newly-wed wife leaves on the noon train, or at least gets on it, though she will get off at the last minute. The judge leaves as soon as he can. The mayor asks in church the marshal to leave, while the parson refuses to commit himself (thou shalt not kill). All his friends avoid him or just plain say no. Alone he is and alone he will have to deal with the four outlaws who are trying to kill him. He will of course succeed. the details of his simple strategy and opportunistic tactics are in the film and you will have to go check them. And the film reveals how cowardly people can be and how they consider law and order is not their problem but that of the professional they pay to take care of it. That's the only really positive point that is different from the standard vision of traditional older western films. It is not blind gunfights and it is not everyone against the criminal. It shows the psychology of people in a crisis situation is very often divided and their reflex is often to hide their heads in the sand or run to cover behind the first bush they can find, senior or junior, who cares, provided it is not a burning bush.

3395658,4,B0016MLIKM,"This is a 2000 made-for-tv remake of the 1952 classic Western with Tom Skerritt in the Gary Cooper role. Both films are based on the novel ""The Tin Star"" by John W. Cunningham.

Skerritt plays just-retired, just-married Marshal Will Kane. He and his bride are informed that a man Kane put in the slammer years ago has been paroled; this owlhoot swore he'd kill Kane when he got out and he's coming in on the noon train. His henchmen are even waiting for him at the train station. Kane and his bride are encouraged to flee for their lives and start their new life together. Why not? -- he's not even a sheriff anymore. But the new Marshal won't arrive for another day or so and something in Kane prevents him from running like a cur with his tail between his legs. He has about an hour and fifteen minutes to marshal up help to make a stand. In addition to all this, his wife is a Quaker who doesn't believe in violence and threatens to leave him if he insists on staying and fighting.

One interesting facet of this Western is that the story plays out in real time. The film runs 88 minutes and Marshal Kane has just over an hour to prepare for the confrontation.

Skerritt does a good job depicting an aging man who is about to face a fight-to-the-death, most likely alone. I'm sure Marshal Kane has better things to do, like enjoy his honeymoon with his beautiful wife (Sussanna Thompson), but his manhood and sense of duty force him to courageously make a stand. This reminds me of times back in High School where I was scheduled to fight someone (after school or whatever). I knew at such-and-such time I was going to face so-and-so and a bunch of people would be watching. The anticipation wasn't fun but my manhood wouldn't let me back down. Of course there's no comparison since Marshal Kane is anticipating a gunfight wherein he could very likely die, not a mere fistfight, but if the anticipation before a fistfight is intense, how much more so a gunfight?

Some criticize the story of ""High Noon"" on the grounds that it makes the citizens of the average Western town out to be a bunch of cowards but, really, there are no less than four people who are willing to help the Marshal. Many of the others who decline have valid reasons for staying out of the fracas, although some are just plain yella.

Since Kane's new wife is a Quaker the film brings up the idea of total pacifism. While the idea is attractive and I understand her reasoning, total pacifism does not work in this present world. The New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. It teaches, rather, that pacifism is proper in certain situations and not in others. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. Even in cases where pacifism is called for a disciple is not to idly sit on his/her rump but to fight on a spiritual level and overcome evil with good. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extemists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. Kane's wife in the film is such a person, but perhaps she'll discover the error of her beliefs. In any case, ""High Noon"" makes an important point: Some people are so morally degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said ""ultimate"").

There are quite a few good parts, e.g. Kane's brief talk with the wife of a coward, the church scene and, of course, the ending gunfight.

As for comparisons to the original film, I have no bias or nostalgia. It's been years since I saw it (the '52 version) so it's not fresh in my memory, but I don't see how this remake pales in comparison as many of the reviewers here contend. This rendition is in color, has a good score, good actors and locations (CL Ranch, Calgary, Alberta). What more do you want? It may not have the cinematic pizzazz of modern Theatrical Westerns but, if given the choice between the two, I'd probably choose Skerritt's version over the original. Besides, I loathe black & white.

So, why not 5/5 Stars? Despite the story's potential and the anticipation of the gunfight, something prevents ""High Noon"" (both versions) from being truly captivating. In fact, it almost has a laid-back vibe. Needless to say, those with ADHD should avoid like the plague. Don't get me wrong, I love great drama and intelligent dialogue-driven stories but something needed done to make it a bit more engrossing and emotionally stirring.

3395680,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is an ""adult"" western in that the townpeople act like townspeople.  When faced by the possibility of an attack by five desperados, they prefer to do nothing and hope for the best.  The movie may have also had a political viewpoint.  We were locked in a deadly cold war with the Soviet Union.  Many people, just as the townpeople in ""High Noon"", reckoned that disarmament and coexistence was a safer policy than confrontation.

Gary Cooper, as the resigning marshal of this small town, expects support--in terms of a posse--from the townsfolk.  United they will outnumber the desperados many times and should be able to kill or capture them.  One by one, however, the would-be posse peals away.  Some won't fight for religious reasons, some for personal reasons, some for diability reasons and one, would be hero, is a drunk.

Cooper is left without allies and a bitter pill it is.  Even his beautiful wife [Grace Kelly] won't stay.  She wants them both to run. The only person who shows some guts is Katie Jurado who wants to fight for the marshal [and we know she would] but he belongs to another woman and so she gets out too.

Cooper, with every expectation of death on a dusty street, waits for the outlaws to arrive on the noon train.  Hollywood style, he manages to gun down his enemies and then, in front of the assembled townsmen, throws down his badge in total disgust.

It's a powerful film of a brave man and of human frailty.

I have heard from several sources that this release will have the restored by Paramount from the original negative film version that has never been released in the states.  I have not seen this version but have read rave reviews on it's extremely clean and sharp look with perfect brightness and contrast.  This print was not allowed to be loaned out for the previous two releases and an inferior print was used. In addition, a friend of mine John Mulholland has done a 50 minute documentory on this movie and he is an expert on both Gary Cooper and High Noon, so it is worth an upgrade just for that.  Below is an excerpt from John on High Noon:

""HIGH NOON was hailed upon its release in 1952 as an instant classic. It won several Academy Awards, including one for its legendary star, Gary Cooper. It was named the year's best picture by the New York Film Critics Society. And yet, even though it's high on the American Film Institute's 100 Best Films of the Century, HIGH NOON's respect has been hard won, indeed. Perhaps no other classic film has had such a rocky road as this ""simple little western.""

Decried by influential auteurist critics and academics, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being untrue to the western genre - read anti-populist; for being ""middle-brow"" (whatever that might mean); for being social drama hiding behind the western genre - and muddled social drama, at that; for being the most un-American film ever made (courtesy of John Wayne), etc.

However, 56 years after its release, HIGH NOON still powerfully resonates with audiences around the world. When Solidarity needed a universal image to promote democracy and the right to vote in Poland in 1987, they chose Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, a ballot in his hand rather than a gun. Conservatives and liberals both manage to cite HIGH NOON on the floor of Congress as a metaphor for their competing political ideals. Political cartoonists and headline writers inevitably use HIGH NOON as reference for countless crises. President Eisenhower cited High Noon as his favorite film, as have President Clinton and former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizuma.

On one hand, HIGH NOON has been attacked for being a conservative, damaging portrait of arrogant male paternalism. On the other hand, HIGH NOON is praised for challenging entrenched notions of gender, for exploring masculine anxiety, masculinity as a construct. Feminist critics and academics are offering intriguing and complex new readings to HIGH NOON.

Example: Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly) is having her new husband, Marshall Will Kane (Cooper), quit his career, leave his town, leave his friends, marry outside his church, and open a store of her choosing (wearing, perhaps, an apron?). Does Will Kane take on the villains at noon as a final gasp of masculine protest, as a declaration of independence from his wife's control?

Ernest Hemingway compared a story's meaning to an iceberg - like the iceberg, 7/8th of which lies hidden beneath the surface, 7/8th of a story's meaning lies beneath the surface.

Carl Foreman's bare-to-the-bones script and Fred Zinnemann's equally spare direction are a perfect film correlative to Hemingway's iceberg theory. This taut, seemingly straightforward little suspense western is complex, multi-layered, and perhaps even more relevant today than when it opened 56 years ago.

3395709,3,B0016MLIKM,"This movie is more than 56 years old and yet it is still relevant and enjoyable today as it undoubtedly was back in those days.  This is because the themes are recurring and just as it was then, it is still the same now with regards human nature.  The parable of the Good Samaritan covers it and so does this wonderful classic film about the sins of omission being just as bad as sins of commission.  Is it okay to let a man go to his death because it is none of your business or is it just as good as if you had pulled the trigger yourself?  Here, Gary Cooper plays a very capable marshall who has managed to selflessly keep his town safe but when it comes to the marshall himself needing some help, the townspeople make up excuses to avoid putting themselves in danger when the marshall himself had been doing this on their behalf for years.  How often do we commit sins of omission ourselves by making excuses to not do the right thing?  This sad and sorry aspect of human nature was present in the parable of the good samaritan, this film and will probably continue to exist today and ever after.

Cooper's performance is brilliant and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar for this film.  People confuse courage with having no fear which is a mistake.  Courage is doing the right thing especially when you are afraid and to do so the more afraid that you are, the more courageous you are.  To have no fear ever is not courage but insanity.  I especially love the part when Cooper admits to Bridges that he was afraid and yet continued to do the right thing.  There are lots of lessons here that we can all learn that are timeless and for this reason, this film will continue to be a classic and relevant for ages to come.

The only problem is with the DVD; the special features consist of a good but not great documentary concerning the making of High Noon.  Although the sound has been THX mastered, the sound quality isn't noticeably much better and could have used a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround treatment or better.  The picture quality is not very good either with imperfections ala white spots and vertical lines every couple of seconds or so of footage.  Although I've seen worse picture quality on other dvds, you'd expect better for a classic film like this one.  Here's hoping that with the advent of Blu-Ray, they will take advantage of the opportunity to properly restore the picture and improve the sound quality options.

Great must-have movie in any film buff's library but you may want to wait for a much better restored version either in Blu-Ray or standard format.

Updated 22 Dec 16 for Blu ray Olive release: 4 stars

The Olive blu ray release is a noticeable upgrade from the standard dvd release I reviewed 8 years ago.  It took me this long to make the upgrade and only after I'd heard comparisons with Criterion releases for Olive releases.  Based upon this release I think Criterion can rest easy at least for now.  This Olive release has much improved picture quality over the standard dvd although heavy DNR is evident in several scenes throughout.  This means dark and white spots and other picture imperfections are almost completely gone but at the expense of sharpness in many scenes.  There is some ghosting in the fast-moving scenes and some dirt at points but you'd have to try hard to notice them.  The sound quality is DTS-HD MA Stereo and is better than a mono presentation on the standard dvd and noticeably less noisy.  Also included is a booklet containing the essay ""Uncitizened Kane"" by Nick James which is a nice touch.  Special features are sparse relative to the usual Criterion release but it's clear who Olive are aspiring to imitate.  Overall not a perfect release but not a terrible one either and this is still superior to the old standard dvd that I reviewed above.  However, I can't help but feel that there is a better quality release out there in the near future.  Who knows, maybe Criterion will get a crack at this too?  Get this if you can't wait but a better version may still be on the horizon.

3395714,5,B0016MLIKM,"Lionsgate has announced a new DVD release of High Noon with new special features.  There is what appears to be a reliable report, though unconfirmed, that it will include a new transfer of the film, restored by Paramount.  The current and older DVDs are only of average video and audio quality.

This a true classic, combining traditional Western themes with contemporary concerns about popular acquiescence to evil, done in a gripping, unusual (nearly real-time) way, with great actors.

Town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is caught between his new pacifist Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) and a felt duty to face down evil men coming on the noon train to take revenge on him (and presumably cause whatever other trouble they please).  Most of the drama takes place in the lead-up to a climactic battle, as the townspeople choose whether to support Kane with action or to let him stand alone.  Amy too must choose between her spouse and her own moral beliefs.  The tension builds relentlessly as we see clocks ticking towards noon.  The innovative black and white cinematography emphasizes the dramatic points, while the internal drama is captured in Cooper's face.

The new DVD features are these:

-- ""Inside High Noon,"" a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (see below for more on this)
-- ""Tex Ritter: A Visit to Carthage, Texas,"" on the Tex Ritter Museum
-- the full performance of ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'"" from the Jimmy Dean TV Show

The features carried over from the current release are:

-- commentary with Gary Cooper's daughter Maria Cooper Janis, screenwriter Carl Foreman's son Jonathan Foreman, director Fred Zinneman's son Tim Zinnemann and Tex Ritter's son John Ritter
-- ""The Making of High Noon"" featurette
-- ""Behind High Noon"" featurette
-- radio broadcast with Tex Ritter

Whether the new features will warrant an upgrade is a matter of personal preference, of course.  A 50-minute documentary could be quite interesting, if it's well done.

It does sound interesting.  The ""new"" documentary, actually made a couple years ago but shelved until now, is by film and Gary Cooper expert John Mulholland.  It's expected to cover, among other things, the conflict between Cooper and John Wayne over the participation of the blacklisted screenwriter Carl Foreman.  Given that the film is intended in part as an allegory of the public's acquiescence in the Red Scare, this will have more than the usual gossipy behind-the-scenes relevance.  It includes interviews with three of the children of the principles who participated in the DVD audio commentary: Cooper's daughter Maria, director Zinneman's son Tim, and Foreman's son Jonathan.  There are also interviews with Grace Kelly's son Prince Albert of Monaco, Western and film historians Brian Garfield, Lee Clark Mitchell, Stephen Prince and Meir Ribalow, and High Noon fan President Bill Clinton.  The narration is by actor Frank Langella.

Lack of agreement between Paramount and Lionsgate prevented the earlier release of a restored transfer and the documentary, in case you're wondering why this didn't come out before.

A parting note on the ethical side of the film.  While everyone can appreciate the strength of Cooper's character and the contrast to the weakness of others, which is no doubt the intended moral focus, we can wonder why the seemingly parallel choices facing Will and Amy are treated differently, with one portrayed heroically for choosing perceived broader duty over duty to spouse, while the other is seemingly approved in doing the opposite (those who have seen the movie will be able to see how that is).  I'm not sure writer Foreman saw that parallel as I put it here, and maybe there are good reasons to argue they aren't really parallel.  It could be a statement about the limits of pacifism, or it could be a reflection of other cultural mores that Foreman didn't question.  Or it could be largely motivated by the need for a certain kind of ending.  I'm not a film historian, so maybe these questions have already been addressed.  If so, feel free to leave a comment about it.",1206835200,,4438,4.98100407055631

3395739,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon  vs. Rio Bravo?

Should we think of it as a competition when Rio Bravo was made as a protest against the way Will Kane had to go around the town looking for special deputies only to get turned down?

The behind-the-scenes talk is that both John Wayne and director Howard Hawks had contempt for High Noon and the way its protagonist went looking for help to fight the bad guys.  Guess these two guys never heard of the Second Amendment or even of special deputies or posses!

Actually as stand-alone stories both movies have messages worth learning.  One should see true life experiences in both of them.  In High Noon the town's people all had excuses for why helping out their marshal wasn't good for them at the moment.  Good thing the men who fought for us in the Revolutionary War didn't refuse to join the Army because they ""got a wife and kids"".

And make no mistake, the U.S. Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment in the base of our political system as a way for the citizenry to remain armed in order to oppose tyranny.  Now it may be true that they were worried more about tyranny from oppressive governments both foreign and domestic, but just how good would the people of Kane's town be against tyranny on a national scale when they couldn't even be bothered to stand up against it in their own back yard?

In High Noon Will Kane eventually finds help from his own wife who comes to see that she owes more loyalty to her vows to her husband than to some goofy religious belief that says that to fight evil you lie down in front of it and spread your legs -- figuratively, if not literally.

In Rio Bravo the sheriff says upholding the law is the job of professionals, then what does he do?  Like his friend says, he employs a drunk and a cripple, and then decides he needs more help and looks to a teenager and deputizes the kid.  LOL  Said cripple, by the way, who so unprofessionally shoots and nearly blows the head off of a fellow deputy and can't even admit it when he made a mistake.  (""How was I supposed to know the Dude was gonna go and git hisself duded up?  Huh?...  HUH???"")  And then when Feathers tries to sit guard in the lobby of the hotel and falls asleep Chance treats her tenderly for her effort and carries her off to bed.  Looks like Wayne and Hawks couldn't make up their minds just what it was they believed!  Sort of schizoid, IMO.

Too bad for them, but no reason for us to not take away some important lessons from both of these movies, one of which is that it seems it is never comfortable or convenient nor can we expect the timing to be ""right"" when we are called upon to stand up against evil; and having one's personal demons going on inside is no excuse to bow out of the fray, turn inward, and forsake the common good.",1201996800,,2781,4.338491295938105
3395740,4,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon (Fred Zinnemann, 1952)

Note: here be spoilers. On the off chance that you haven't seen or heard anything about the movie, you may want to skip this review.

There's a scene in High Noon that just makes it for me. It's pretty close to the end, right at the point where Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has realized that no one in town is going to help him fight Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) and his gang, and resigned to his fate, he leaves his office and heads up to the depot to confront Miller. As he walks down the street, the camera pulls away from him to an aerial view, but there's nothing smooth about the pullback; it's jerky and swerving and jolting, as if the whole town is about to fall down around Kane's ears, or as if to simulate what must be going on in Kane's stomach, or both. How often do you see that in a movie nowadays? (,he says just after writing reviews for No Country for Old Men and The Dreamers.) It's not so much the symbolism of the thing as the fact that it seems so natural, as if someone on the set said, ""hey, we've got a pullback here, wouldn't it be neat if we did this with it...?"".

It's probably inexcusable for someone who fancies himself a media critic to have seen as few Gary Cooper movies as I have in my lifetime, but after finally seeing High Noon, I plan to watch a lot more of them. Cooper is as laconic as he is iconic, the plain-spoken good guy who realizes he's got a job to do whether anyone wants to help him with it or not. He comes off as a bit dour, which makes me wonder why his new Quaker wife Amy (Grace Kelly) would have married him in the first place, but that's a minor thing. Kane's demeanor sets him apart not only from the bad guys (and a fine batch they were-- MacDonald is backed up by country singer Sheb Wooley, prolific character actor Robert Wilke, and a young lee van Cleef), but from the townsfolk; not a coincidence, one thinks, especially given the film's oft-noted red scare subtext (the subtext that caused John Wayne to remark that High Noon was the most anti-American movie ever made).

Honestly, now that I've opened that door, I can't see the red scare subtext as valid to criticism of the movie any more. It was half a century ago, and we all realize it was idiotic (at least, I hope we do). Ignore it when watching the movie now. There are so many other reasons to like the movie. Zinnemann's casting was dead-on for almost every role, even in the places where he ended up using his fifth or sixth choice for a role (Gary Cooper was far from Zinnemann's first choice for Kane, for example). Cooper and Kelly are fantastic, and their odd lack of chemistry is offset by the fact that the two have very few scenes together. The rest of the townsfolk are uniformly excellent, as is to be expected when one's talent pool contains such notables as Harry Morgan, Lon Chaney Jr., Lloyd Bridges, and Katy Jurado. Zinnemann's direction is excellent, coupled with Floyd Crosby's groundbreaking cinematography, which is played up quite nicely with Elmo Williams' editing (Williams is responsible for the real-time aspect of the film, which was originally meant to run a good deal longer; Crosby was the guy who figured out how to make the film look so sere. No, you're not watching a faded print). A number of very talented folks worked on this movie, and they all brought their A games. One for the ages. ****",1201564800,,3382,4.39776357827476
3395741,5,B0016MLIKM,"HIGH NOON (1952-NR) stars Gary Cooper, Grace Kelly (her first role) and Lloyd Bridges and is arguably the best western of all time. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards and winner of 4. Also, AFI Top 100 of all time. Will Kane (Gary Cooper) has just said his wedding vows with his new bride (Grace Kelly) and is about to turn in his badge as sheriff and leave the town he had singlehandedly cleaned up, with his pacifist Quaker wife. As they're about to ride out of town in their buckboard limo, three tough hombres ride into town and let it be known that Frank Miller is arriving on the noon train-it's now 10:40 AM. Will leaves but just out of town turns around and comes back.  He can't leave now.  He's responsible for arresting Frank Miller and sending him up to prison.  He was supposed to be executed but instead he's paroled and coming back to get even. Will believes he can round up a posse to defend the town during the next hour as the film progresses in real time. The plot is simple but the acting is terrific and the scenes are tight and tense as he tries to recruit help as well as keep his new bride. All this leads up to the showdown at HIGH NOON and the final, climactic scene-a great one. More than just a good western, there are some underlying themes of courage (and lack thereof) as well as the issue of pacificism and 'standing by your man'. This is the role that got Grace Kelly's career on track.  One interesting note-on Netflix there's a commentary on issues for parents to judge whether a film is suited for children and what age.

Be sure to watch film historian Leonard Maltin's segment at the end of the film where you will have the privilege of seeing some of the main artists involved in the making of the film talk about it.  It is fascinating.

Without Gary Cooper, I don't believe this film could or would have been made.  It required an actor who was an ambivert - not totally introverted or he could not have portrayed the role, but not totally extroverted either, or we would not have the nuances of an inner life which shown through Cooper's performance.  His was the academy award that year, and it was wholly deserved.

If you haven't seen this film, don't hesitate.  I somehow compare it to another great film, ""Grand Illusion,"" also filmed in black and white with a low budget.

High Noon (DVD)

High Noon (1952) might very well be the best Western movie ever made.  It stars Gary Cooper as the town Marshall and Grace Kelly as his new bride.

The movie opens with the Marshall getting married and concomitantly the telegraph operator receiving an alarming telegraph.  The telegraph operator writes out the message, the Justice of the Peace reads the wedding ceremony.  Will the Marshall get married before the telegraph message can be delivered? The telegraph operator finishes and runs out the door toward town,.  ""He's moving pretty fast for a Sunday"" comments a bystander  The telegraph operator runs, the Justice of the Peace reads, will he make it?  Yes, they're pronounced Man and Wife.  Yeah!

The telegraph operator burst into the room.  ""Marshal, Marshal, you have a telegram"" The Marshal reads that a murderer who he helped arrest just got pardoned.  Probably by a` Democrat Governor.  Remember Bill Clinton's pardons?  The murderer, Frank is expected on the noon train.  Close up of the clock, eighty-four minutes from now.  Meanwhile three of Frank's friends ride into town and wait for the noon train.  Pretty obvious what they're waiting for.  Meanwhile the townspeople try to bundle the Marshall and his bride out of town on a buckboard.  The Marshall makes it a ways out of town, then stops the buckboard and turns to his bride and says ""  I just can't do it""  I can't run away .  His bride, a Quaker, disagrees with him and wants him to run away.  When they get back to town.  His bride lays out an ultimatum.  Choose, either leave town or lose me,  The Marshall stays.

For the next sixty minutes or so the Marshal has all his ""friends"" turn against him, one after the other.  Nobody is willing to help.  It looks like it `s going to be four against one, with the Marshall being the the one.  The suspense slowly builds until there is a mighty climax at the end.

You'll just have to watch the movie to see how it ends.  It's worth it.

Highly recommended for fans of the old fashion Western movie.

3395761,5,B0016MLIKM,"That's how Kane must have felt: if he runs, Miller will chase him down and kill him; if he stays to fight, the townspeople will not lift a finger to help him. His only choice is to stay and fight, hoping against all odds that he will still be alive when it is over.

As I watched the film, I could sense that Kane must have had serious doubts as noon approached. Too late to run, even if it could have done any good. The townspeople - his so-called ""friends"" - abandoning him in his hour of need. One minute they are grateful for all that he has done for them and the next minute, they are writing him off for dead and making plans on how to live with Miller and his gang after they kill the marshall. Okay, not ALL the townspeople turned their backs on him. There was a young boy who Kane would not allow to fight, being so young. Another was a drunk, who doubtless truely wished to help, but would have ben no real good to the marshall. There was an eager volunteer who backed-out once he realized that it would only have been the two of them against Miller and his gang. Lastly, there were a few men who did volunteer to assist Kane, only to back-out after being talked out of it by their fellow townspeople. So, in the end, Kane stood all alone on an empty street. He even watched as his wife and former girlfriend rode past him on their way to board the very same train that Miller arrived on!

Even though I knew how it would all end, having read about this film and never having seen it before, I had this strong feeling of tension as noon approached. I could even feel the twisting knot in my stomach as I saw the camera pan back, showing Kane standing alone on the street, with no one else around. Suspending disbelief, I wondered what Kane was thinking as the showdown approached.

In the end, of course, Kane was alive and as he boarded his coach to leave town for the final time, I could also feel the strong sense of disgust at the townspeople for their cowardice and I could easily understand why he dropped his badge in the dust before boarding the wagon. If just four men had positioned themselves with rifles in windows overlooking the street, the fight could have been over in seconds, with only the outlaws getting killed and no one else hurt or endangered. Despite their superiority of numbers and the fact that had superior firepower over the outlaws, if only they had utilized it, they still cowered behind their doors and waited until the end.

John Wayne's feeling towards this movie notwithstanding, this is a true American story: one man, standing alone against evil, despite all odds and having been abandoned by everyone he thought he could trust to help him.

If only we all could be as courageous as Marshall Will Kane when the time comes.",1182556800,,2769,4.379377431906615

This western diverged from its colleagues because it is about duty, responsibility,

selfishness, greed.  Suspenseful and thought provoking, at 90 minutes it is

3395806,5,B0016MLIKM,"It is considered one of the ""classic"" Westerns, but the reality is that it bears little to no resemblance to the standard oater.  Aside from a brief tussle between Cooper & Bridges, there is no action until roughly the last 10 minutes of the movie.

It is interesting how widely perceptions vary with this movie.  To me, that is the hallmark of good work, because the answers aren't in black & white.  Again, not the typical Western.  We know that the outlaws are the bad guys, but are the townspeople also villains, or are they simply trying to do the best they can to protect their own collective self-interest by choosing the past of least resistance?  Is Will Kane a hero, or is he too proud to run --- or is he, like the townspeople, simply calculating what is in his best interests?  After all, he has a better chance of protecting himself within the city limits than he does out on the open prairie --- he says as much himself.  He takes the gamble that enough townspeople will appreciate the job he has done as marshal & will help him face the outlaws --- as it turns out, he guesses wrong and has to face the music.  It would have made a most interesting outcome if Will Kane had been gunned down in the streets, and the townspeople also made to face the music for their own decisions.

As has been said time and again, this started out as a subtle allegory of the failure of intellectuals to stand up to the persecutions of HUAC and McCarthy, but the themes of the film now transcend those topical references and keep it from being dated.  Of course, it is the definitive Gary Cooper role --- in many ways more vulnerable than heroic.  One can see in his face that he knows damned well that he'll probably be dead in a few minutes, and it makes his character all that much more compelling as a result.

Everybody should be able to identify with this story --- at one time or another, we've practically all been a Will Kane or a citizen in the town, and we've had to make the tough decisions.  This alone should make ""High Noon"" ring true for every viewer.",1172448000,,2065,4.371727748691099

3395808,4,B0016MLIKM,"The characters in this drama really stick in your brain somehow. Gary Cooper of course, but also Grace Kelly and Lloyd Bridges. My favorite is Katy Jurado as the Spanish lady still in love with Gary Cooper. Her voice is wonderfully husky and smoky. The way she puts down Lloyd Bridges is incredible: ""You're a handsome boy with broad shoulders, but HE [Cooper] is a MAN."" And she tells Grace Kelly, ""If he were my man, I would never leave. I would stay and fight. "" Katy Jurado as Ellen Ramirez is just so incredible. It's a great movie, but it doesn't have the depth of many other westerns. It suffers for being a shallow allegory of McCarthyism. As someone else pointed out, it's Cooper's job to defend the town, not the civilians'.",1164412800,,734,4.526315789473684
3395809,4,B0016MLIKM,"I enjoyed High Noon quite a bit and despite of my desire to do so, I won't go into the details that have been repeated many times over by others who wrote a review on this movie. This movie was Gary Cooper's finest effort and as a man in trouble, he was totally believable and totally real. But I have to take John Wayne's perception on this movie and states that its not as great as the hype made it up to be. Cooper played a sherriff of this town who is awaiting recently released gunmen from prison. They are professional gunsligners and Cooper's character wanted amatuer townsmen to aid him. Professional killers needs professional lawmen to deal with, Cooper is that man and the burden fall on him. His effort to induced untrained townsmen who are not fit to support him into this situation sounds pretty weak and perhaps in the western mode...unmanly. His new wife played by Grace Kelly only further do damage by trying to make a coward out of a man she married. She failed to see that if she secceded, she would have ruin the man she love by making him what he wasn't. But despite of his doubts, fears and lack of support, Cooper's character does his job effectively and with honor. Maybe it is a great western after all.

Unlike many reviewers before me, I take a very different view of this film. Many believed that Gary Cooper is some sort of victim forced into a confrontation against all odds. I see it differently. Many western fans often compared this with Rio Bravo where the sherriff refused help from town's people he believes to be unfit to do the job, thus keeping them from harm's way - which is his job as well as the job of Will Kane.",1164240000,,1656,4.411764705882353
3395810,5,B0016MLIKM,"For many, Gary Cooper was the Westerner par excellence--cool, taciturn, courageous and just; skilled with a gun but slow to use it; gentlemanly, generous and shy, appealing to men as much as to women... This image reached its culmination in ""High Noon"" with his characterization of Marshal Will Kane, the brave and stubborn ex-marshal standing alone against the forces of evil, and the prototype for countless Western heroes ever since...

Highly-stylized, carefully and beautifully shot, ""High Noon"" possibly owes its great popularity to a combination of three things--It's a suspense film in the real sense; the dearly beloved set-piece climax of the gun duel never got better or more thoughtful treatment; it has a theme tune that persistently whines its way into the subconscious... Most people first remember the Dimitri Tiomkin theme tune, then Gary Cooper stalking down the lonely street... The bits and pieces gather from there... The film also ties a small town of do-nothings showing their cowardice by turning their backs on trouble, integrity, and an elected representative...

""High Noon"" is also distinguished by many fine images from the incidental (the brief close-up of the wagon wheel revolving against the town's facades as Cooper and Kelly leave the community); to the poignant ( Zinneman's camera drawing back from Cooper's face to show him standing vulnerable and alone in the dust of a deserted main street); to the deliberately melodramatic (Cooper bitterly grinding his marshal's badge in the dirt before riding away for good ).

By means of rapid cross-cutting, Fred Zinnemann gives shots--repeatedly--of the pendulum of the clock, of the empty railroad tracks, and in rapid succession, shots of tense faces--taken at close range--of the townsfolk in the church, in the local saloon, then of the worried face of the marshal, his wife, and of the three criminals ready for the approaching train...

""High Noon"" is the simple and forceful tale of an aging lawman on his day of retirement and also on his wedding day...

Will Kane, on a blazing June morning in 1875, has just married a pretty young Quaker girl... The bride feels doubly blessed... She's got her man, and this is the day he will hang his guns... She has firm Quaker convictions and never did imagine herself as a lawman's wife...

But, while it's all being celebrated a badly shaken stationmaster (Ted Stanhope) bursts in with quite the wrong kind of wedding telegram... It states that an outlaw Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) whom Kane had put behind bars six years ago for terrorizing the town has been released... The stationmaster adds that three members of his old gang are already awaiting his arrival at the depot--their object a reunion with the pardoned man who will get off the train at noon, and presumably settle the score with Kane...

The marshal, like a sensible man, does, in fact, put his wife in the buggy, but then like a man of honor but also a sensible man (for the gang will surely hunt them down wherever they go) changes his mind and heads the horses back to town...

A bride, especially a Quaker bride, can't quite see it this way on her wedding day so she hands him her own ultimatum--if he won't go away with her she'll go alone by train--the one that leaves at twelve...

Everything on this torrid, dusty morning therefore hinges on midday--therefore Kramer's insistence on his clocks. From this point onwards High Noon, although it remains completely classic in Western terms, faithful to period and concerned with an indicative historical situation, takes on wide and profound implications...

It's about group cowardice and short-term interest--particularly the treachery of so-called 'good' people... 'Law abiding,' you feel, doesn't mean what it should mean... When a group of people decide that they must passively refuse to support the law for reasons of personal preservation, who, in fact, are the outlaws?

Thus the marshal's predicament... He is an embarrassment to everyone, from Judge (Otto Kruger)--he's leaving town--to the humblest citizen of Hadleyville... Only one is ready to give assistance and he melts away when he finds there'll be no other volunteers... The marshal's immature deputy (Lloyd Bridges) is willing to take over his job--again, provided Cooper leaves town... But this is absolute ambition at work...

The build-up of tension as the lawman prepares to meet the four thugs and makes fruitless attempts to recruit help from the cowardly citizens has never been handled better, and it is sustained right up to and through the climactic gunfight as the lawman's bride finds herself trapped in the crossfire...

Filmed in Black and White, ""High Noon"" is among the ten Best Westerns ever made... The film achieved the shape of a democratic allegory which reached people in much the same way and for the same reasons that ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" had done... Its cutting suspense was the hallmark of Zinneman's mastery of the movie medium...

Gary Cooper's performance, as the very vulnerable, worried man, won him the year's Oscar...",1163030400,,5082,5.070658682634731

3395812,4,B0016MLIKM,"This is a film based on the western novel, The Tin Star.  This particular version is a Ron Hardy remake (headlining Tom Skerritt) of the Gary Cooper movie classic by the same name - High Noon.

The story is austerely set in an Old West town, and is simple . . . the bad guy has been released from prison and is arriving on the noon train.  He will seek revenge on the Marshal.  The bad guy is bringing friends.  Sounds pretty familiar.  Add that the Marshal is a newlywed, and ready to retire.  He also has an old flame in town.  The townspeople love him but will not physically risk themselves to help him.  The Marshal is facing this alone and has a bad feeling about his situation but is resolved to be faithful to his duty.  It's a good story, but simple and puts a big load on the lead actor to pull it off well.

I'll go ahead and jump onboard the comparison wagon (everyone else has), and comment on this version as compared to the original. Reviewers are being really tough on this remake, but, my opinion . . . if you've never seen the original, you'll enjoy this.  If you have already seen the original, you'll probably still enjoy this.  A film remake analogy that comes to mind is the great, On the Beach, from Neville Shute's novel.  The original was one of the greatest films of all time.  The remake is a pretty good film.

This newer version is missing a few things - mainly Gary Cooper. It also lacks that classic music theme and the general ambiance of those great 40's/50's Hollywood westerns.  On the upside, Tom Skerritt does a very good job of selling himself as an aging and vulnerable lawman ready to retire.  Susanna Thompson was rather weak as the newlywed Quaker bride, but the rest of the supporting cast is adequate.  Production values are moderately good and the set is believable with plenty of mud and general grunge that was lacking in the original.

It was a nice re-visit to a favorite old movie tale.",1161820800,,1936,4.4
3395813,5,B0016MLIKM,"I have read a number of good reviews of this DVD on this site, especially the one written by Dennis Littrel. I will thus only add a small personal impression. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself. This is not what we were expected to see from Western heroes. Also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win. Also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person. If he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly Mexican woman?

I am only speaking about my own naivete of course.

I too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety.

This is to say that while I sensed somehow the movie is 'good' I could not because of the perplexity I felt , enjoy it.

The good guy does not run. He does stand up and alone face the bad guys. His fiancee though she has principles of non- violence when it comes down to it does the 'realistic and necessary thing' to save the one she loves.

A realistic moral Hollywood drama , and of course made haunting by the 'Do not Forsake me Oh my darling' in the background.",1150761600,,1253,4.204166666666667
3395814,5,B0016MLIKM,"It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it's rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because ""I have to,"" and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.

Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and ""courage under fire,"" a character who says in the novel that ""abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene""? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing.

It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like ""24,"" and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway.

3395836,5,B0016MLIKM,"A heroic tale of individualistic morality that that has no identifiable political overtones as many suggest but a philosophical one of confronting the threat of wrong doing by proper action.

The movie is not a romantic theme of one against many nor a moral crusade but clearly stresses the impact that one can have on the few or many.

when put into difficult choices the imperative that ones conscience needs to be the only moral guide ruling passion plays the leading role in this movie.

The fact that Marshall Kane confronts a murderer with the resolve of keeping the peace and harmony for the town doubled later with his Quaker wife acting against her pacifistic philosophy by thwarting the murderous outlaw Miller is a a case in point of a clear situation of confronting evil as an individual matter despite the common folk wisdom of the day as shared by the apathetic town who remain isolationist despite the clear and present danger of having the outlaw Miller return and wreak havoc not only the Marshall but the possible return into anarchy and lawlessness that once ruled prior to Kane's triumph the first time around.

The movie poses a few aspects governing life.

1. Can one man make a difference in the overall moral compass?

2. Why do people act fearfully when confronting wrong?

3. When is it acceptable to go against the majority opinion of a society when the society is wrong?

4. The need at times for quick decision making even when the odds are stacked against you.

The movie depicts these questions and answers forcibly on the side of justice and righteousness.

3395837,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon (1952) is one of the best Western films ever made, but some critics see it as a parable of events in Hollywood at the time, especially the Cold War, the persecution of un-American screenwriters (in retrospect justified), and attitudes of pacifism, etc. This may be the case, but really it's a story about a man who is too proud to run.

It is a taut, tightly-scripted, minimalist film sharply focused on the tale of a solitary, stoic, honor-bound marshal/hero, past his prime and already retired, who is left desolate and abandoned by the townspeople he has faithfully protected for many years.

Due to the townspeople's cowardice, physical inability, self-interest, expediency, and indecisiveness, he is refused help at every turn against a revenge-seeking killer and his gang. Fearful but duty-bound, he eventually vanquishes the enemy, thereby sparing the town from the outlaws. Embittered by film's end, he tosses his tin star into the dirt as if to say to the town, ""There, I saved you, but you didn't deserve it.""

Gary Cooper is the epitome of the noble, courageous, self-sacrificing White man who carved America out of the wilderness. In this way the movie works much better as an parable of the way present day America (the townspeople) turns its back on its heroic White traditions (Gary Cooper).",1139616000,,1316,5.0

It's about integrity, standing against evil, responsibility, and being a real hero. That this story is a Western is almost incidental. I consider it to be a classic moral story more than a classic Western, although it functions perfectly well as a Western. Marshal Will Kane certainly does not want to die or fight alone. He considers running away, more from a desire to avoid unnecessary trouble than from cowardice - though he is afraid - but he realizes that running is not a solution in this case. Kane doesn't overcome fear; he faces it. Each man in town has his own reasons for not helping Kane, displaying various aspects of passivity, apathy, fear, greed, and rationalization. The acting, setting, and dialogue are sparse but brilliant. The music helps to set the right emotional tone, and the theme song is especially evocative.

3395842,5,B0016MLIKM,"Some ""classic"" movies become such icons that everyone knows they've seen them but never watches them again because ""everybody's seen that already."" If ""High Noon"" is that kind of film for you OR if you've never managed to see it because everybody AROUND you has that impression, here is a great way to reaquaint yourself with a classic that is not only a barrier-breaking western, it's also a film classic regardless of genre and worthy of the term.

Aside from the story of duty and how Gary Cooper's lawman feels obligated to stand up to the criminal who's coming to gun him down on the noon train (hence the title) the whole subtext of standing against prevailing opinion, germane in the McCarthy-ite 50's when this film was made, makes overall impressions beyond the plot itself. The vision of beauty that is the young Grace Kelly as his new Quaker/pacifist wife only adds to the enjoyment as do performances by supporting players like Lloyd Bridges and Katy Jurado and the later-to-be-made-famous-by-Spaghetti-westerns Lee Van Cleef as one of the badguy's henchmen.

This restored and picture perfect edition also includes a short but interesting documentary on the making of the film hosted by movie historain Leonard Maltin that interviews most of the people involved in the film, and a SECOND little special feature talks with the surviving children of Cooper, Kelly, the director, producer, and other principal participants, including the late John Riter, son of singing cowboy star Tex Ritter who made a hit of the theme song---and WOW does GARY COOPER's daughter look, talk, and even move like him!

Another interesting point made by the documentaries--""High Noon"" was perhaps the first film ever made to use the technique of ""real time""--it is almost exactly in synch with the actual minutes clicking down towards Noon and the many clocks in the film used to heighten the suspense are all in synch with each other--kind of a 1950's Western version of the modern TV hit ""24"" and unique for its time that way.

""High Noon"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies and westerns ever made for a reason. In case you forgot, or never knew, why, this version is the one to get and, I'm sure, watch over and over through the years.",1127520000,,2241,4.858638743455497

3395844,3,B0016MLIKM,"First -- the film itself is a classic and justly deserves a five-star rating.  This particular DVD release, however, may be a bit disappointing for some.  The ""collector's edition"" features some film commentary and behind-the-scenes discussion, but almost all of it is focused on drawing parallels between the film's storyline and the hearings on Un-American acitivities that occurred about the same time the movie was made.

While some comparison between the two is legitimate, the feature-length commentary virtually ignores other allegorical interpretations.  What makes ""High Noon"" a classic is that, besides simply being a story about duty and integrity when the chips are down, it can represent different things to different people.

If one is hell-bent on viewing it allegorically, one can find it representative of World War II, the Cold War, the war on terrorism, a conflict between the domestic and the foreign, a struggle for gender or racial equality, etc. etc.  Heaven forbid one should simply like it as a story of a good guy whippin' the bad guys.

But to view its symbolism only within the confines of a parable about internecine politics is narrow-minded and diminishes its status as a classic work of photographic, dramatic, and narrative art.  Very little is said of these aspects of the film in the course of the commentary; the conversation always comes back to the Hollywood blacklist.  I would like to have learned more about how this or that technical problem was solved, and less repetitive annotation about Carl Foreman's political persecution.

So to sum up -- great movie, and no doubt many will be delighted with this release, but the collector's edition may not be for everybody.  A no-frills version may work just as well.",1124668800,,1753,5.094405594405594

3395869,5,B0016MLIKM,"It also contains arguably the best music video style use in a motion picture.  The film opens with three men riding on horses together confidantly and with a purpose that isn't immediately apparent.  You start to think that this is going to be a good shoot em up film.  That mislead is a great thing that this film gets right.  To the person seeing it a second time (and hopefully not reading this review first) it dramatizes the incoming story well.  What you end up getting is a story about what is necessary to provoke action and whether ideals and quality of life are things worthy to fight for, whether fighting is necessary at all.  To a certain extent, the film becomes increasingly dry leading up to the ending, but I don't think the portions that take their time are bad in any way, they seem very real.  These portions are why people think this film is crap today, but back then the film came out around the time of the red scare and a number of people involved in the film were blacklisted.  The film also presents a hero who has to ask for help and doesn't really get any.  This flies in the face of all the Western fantasy of what a hero is like.  In the common Western the hero inspires by example, doesn't have to ask, always comes out on top, never breaks a sweat, and is always believed by the common folk in the film to be in the right.  ""High Noon"" is what is referred to as a revisionist western and John Wayne with his director friend Howard Hawks took the same idea and changed around the results creating the epic  ""Rio Bravo."" To restate the differences between the two films, this film is not an epic, but a story about underlying questions of principle in everyday life.  I imagine what most people disliked about this film was that it's a critique of society and presents all parties involved in a less than sterling light.  To me, the movie stands the test of time well because it's smart, it sticks to certain motif's throughout (the sense of dread through clocks), the opposition of the main character by his wife who's a Quaker.  Also, it separates itself from being a formulaic western thriller by not constantly keeping the water boiling and giving the audience time to consider the underlying principles and rationally judge the situation, just like the hero.  Interestingly, the film ends with the hero coming out on top, but it's not a positive thing here, it's almost an afterthought.  So, in summary, this is not an action western, it's a ponderous one, so if that's what you want, well you can rent/buy ""Rio Bravo.""

3395870,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly are spectacular in what is considered one of the best westerns ever made, but should be ranked as one of the greatest films ever produced because it easily transcends its genre.

A morality play that was deliberately produced in stark black-and-white to heighten the mood, the story revolves around Cooper's character, the aging Marshal of Hadleyville who, when the film begins, weds Kelly's character. Cooper has retired and plans to return after his honeymoon as a store keeper because his wife is a Quaker and a pacifist. Plans immediately go awry, however, when it is discovered that a notorious killer whom Cooper had arrested and was expected to have been executed, was instead pardoned. The killer is expected to arrive back in town on the noon train to take revenge on Cooper. Three of his equally savage gang have already arrived and are waiting for him at the train station.

The townspeople urge Cooper to flee with his new wife, but as he starts out of town, he stops, then returns, convinced that he has a responsibility to protect the town and bring the outlaws to justice. Pinning the marshal's badge back on, Cooper tries to deputize residents, but no one will help him and he is forced to stand alone. In powerful scenes, Cooper is forced to ask for help time-after-time but is turned down by residents who refuse to accept civic responsibility or acknowledge the debt they owe Cooper, rationalizing their decision not to act.

Kelly doesn't understand her new husband and threatens to leave on the same noon train if he persists in remaining as the marshall this one last time. Kelly eventually begins to understand what drives Cooper but only after forming an unlikely friendship with his former girlfriend, who teaches Kelly about loyalty and character. Ironically, it is Kelly the pacifist who saves Cooper's life by picking up a .45 and killing one of the gunmen.

In the last scene, the steets are utterly deserted until the gunmen are killed, then the townspeople, who had been hiding, flock around Cooper and Kelly. Without a word, Cooper removes his badge and drops it in the dirt. He and Kelly leave together.

Throughout the movie, the stirring music and the real-time focus of the minutes ticking by until High Noon, serve to increase the movie's tension. The film combines elements of love, trust, duty, honor and courage in unexpected ways that are both thought-provoking and entertaining. The DVD version is crisp and clean, the story as powerful today as when it was filmed.

3395872,3,B0016MLIKM,"The House Committee on Un-Amewrican Activities (HUAC) was created in 1938 as a means to investigate people suspected of Communism and supporting Communism. Its first major attack was on the Hollywood film industry. Blacklisting of Hollywood writers, actors, producers, directors, and others suspected of Communist affiliations began with the committee's hearings in October 1947 and flourished throughout the 1950's, a period known as the Red Scare. Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted ""witch hunts"" in an attempt to find and eliminate suspected Communists. The Committee began its hearing with ""friendly witnesses"" who shared the opinions of the HUAC. Each witness provided answers the Committee wanted to hear in order to set the tone for later witnesses who might resist giving information. The ""unfriendly"" witnesses became known as The Hollywood Ten, who were cited for contempt of Congress and jailed for failure to cooperate with the House Committee.

HIGH NOON has been called a parable for the situation of those Americans who stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Investigating Committee and to the House of UnAmerican Activities Commitee during the Red Scare. It became an American classic, not only for its stylistic innovations, but also as an allegory to the McCarthy era. HIGH NOON is said to have reformultated the traditional Western and became a successful box-office surprise, breaking house records.

The movie takes place within the course of a few hours, in the small town of Hadleyville, New Mexico, as Marshall Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is being wed to his beautiful young bride, Amy Fowler Kane (Grace Kelly). The entire town has turned out for the event, that is, until news arrives that a band of ex-cons working for convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) have returned to settle a score with Kane after their arrests under his law landed them in prison.

The script was written by Carl Foreman, who was blacklisted as a result of the Red Scare. It is said that Foreman's Blacklisting and his betrayal at the hands of his colleagues defined and shaped the motion picture. What should have been the high point of Foreman's career was nothing more than a lonely exile for him. Shut away from family and friends, Foreman was excluded from most of the production on HIGH NOON and faced serious bouts with depression. His old partner, Stanley Kramer, betrayed him by severing their business ties and removing his credit as producer of the film, due to the Blacklist, instead of helping his friend fight. To look at the script, its characters, and its situations, is to realize the resemblance of the situation to the plight of those who populate the film itself.

Consider Cooper's Kane, for example. His desperation quickly grows when it becomes clear that no one in the town is willing to take a stand by his side once noon arrives. In less than two hours, he's gone from being commended and applauded at his wedding to being the center of attention as the cause of the town's tensions and dangers, all because of doing his everyday work. Whether or not screenwriter Foreman was intentionally trying to reveal something about our society at this period in time is uncertain, but the film definitely mirrors his own predicament and the betrayal he felt.

Throughout the duration of the film, which takes place in real time, Foreman and director Fred Zinnemann also examine the effects of the impending danger on certain members of the townsfolk. The film's elements of loyalty, betrayal, trust and mistrust, are all factors that came into play during McCarthyism, and tie in brilliantly with reality. Kane's bride, Amy, is torn between her fear of violence and bloodshed and her devotion to her husband, while many of the townsfolk grapple with the choice of standing behind their Marshall or finding an excuse to hide, as seen in an interrupted church service, where a pleading Kane is shot down by his own citizens. These are people struck by fear, and out of that fear they are willing to leave Kane to fend for himself.

HIGH NOON is about loyalty and betrayal. Loyalty on Kane's part - even when everyone deserts him, he stands his ground, though it seems inevitable that the action will cost him his life. And betrayal on the town's part. Many of the locals are agreed that they owe their prosperity to Kane, but they will not help him or defend him, because they believe his cause to be hopeless. In the end, Kane is forced into the showdown on his own, until, at a crucial moment, Amy proves herself to be a worthy wife, fighting to protect her husband.

Without support from the townsfolk, Kane will no longer be their leader. Silently, without a backward glance or goodbye, he and Amy ride off into the distance from the community of weak, fickle onlookers. The contemptible crowd that was unwilling to fight to preserve its law and order remains silent as the buckboard goes out of view, accompanied by the title song's famous melancholy ballad. A parallel to other ""hostile witnesses"" who wound up abandoning their careers? Perhaps.",1112140800,,5079,4.954225352112676

3395886,2,B0016MLIKM,"When commie Carl Foreman wrote this, he was following in the footsteps of his fellow Communists in blurring, blending, twisting and ultimately distorting the age old story of good vs. evil. Many of the reviews of this movie over the decades have said that this movie was a way for Foreman to portray himself vicariously as Cooper in standing up for what is right when he lied before the House Un-American Committee about his Communist ties. His testimony occurred long before Senator Joe McCarthy showed up, but this film is somehow an attack on ""McCarthyism"" and McCarthy, who never served in the House of Representatives or on HUAC. It is a classic example of how the communists were so successful in infiltrating the US opinion makers. The recent revelations of the KGB have shown that McCarthy was essentially correct, and that Communists in the USA took their orders from Moscow during the Cold War.

The good part of the movie is that the USA has historically had men and women who have stood up for what is morally right. The bad part of this movie is that the extraordinary country that the USA is had been co-opted in many ways by a very smart and very smarmy Communist like Foreman, who steals the ideal, and like the rat that he was, contaminates it to make it something closer to his goal of using good motives for evil purposes. Try to find a movie that exposes the fact that Stalin murdered millions more than Hitler in his evil program to advance communism. You won't find one because the ethos of Hollywood is still steeped in the tradition of supporting communism as these multi-millionaires have their chauffeurs drive them to the studio from their seaside mansions in Malibu or Beverly Hills.

Cooper is great in this movie, but it is defiled by the legacy that its author was yet another commie agent who viewed the masses as stupid and easily subject to manipulation. Kind of like a Cold War Moore. Unfortunately he was very right in this regard as proven by many who view this movie as a triumph of attacking a Senator who has been shown much more correct than wrong. Sad thing about the end of the Cold War. When it ended, the rocks got picked up and the roaches had nowhere to hide.

""High Noon"" says in effect: these are the things that REALLY matter in life. How desperately America's youth needs to be instructed in these principles, how tragic it is that they are not.

3395890,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is the film that has been screened most often at the White House for the President of the United States.  Given that this is the story of a man who stands up to considerable opposition to do the right thing, even when he is abandoned by everyone who should be rushing to his side, the idea that this is a perennial Presidential favorite is rather reassuring (as opposed to the legend of Richard Nixon watching ""Patton"" before deciding to invade Cambodia).  You can imagine that ""High Noon"" has been screened at the White House once or twice in the last three years.

Regardless of any impact on America's political and military history, ""High Noon"" is a seminal film in the genre of Western movies.  Until 1952 Hollywood was producing what we would know call the traditional western, where the good guy in the white hat defeats the bad guy in the black hat.  In this format we not only followed the adventures of the Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, and Hopalopng Cassidy, but we also knew the names of their horses (Silver, Trigger, and Topper, respectively).  However, with ""High Noon"" (and ""Shane"" the following year), we had the creation of the Adult Western, which introduced the notion of moral doubt and had a hero that was going to end up kissing a woman rather than his horse.  In these westerns the hero remains the moral leader of the community, but now he can make mistakes, although they are rarely fatal errors.  Ironically, the hero's flawed character actually makes him even more heroic, because he has to struggle against himself as well as against the bad guys.

Director Fred Zinnemann's film contains the same elements as the Traditional Western, but with significant differences.  Will Kane (Gary Cooper) is the moral lawman who protects the town of Hadleyville, but he is about to marry Amy Fowler (Grace Kelly), a Quaker who insists that he give up his job as the marshal of his western town.  There is the big gunfight with the bad guys, but it takes place at the climax of the film.  Except for one brief fistfight, this is much more of a psychological drama than an action film until the final scene.  But the suspense of the film, especially as the clock is ticking down to twelve, becomes quite intense, helped by Elmo Williams' editing.  There is a sense in which the final gunfight is almost anti-climatic, because whether Will Kane lives or dies he has made his main point. But the gunfight is also subversively different, because it is not played out in the main street of town but in the barns and back alleys, more like guerilla warfare than the traditional mano-e-mano contest.

Less than two hours after the wedding, convicted murderer Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) is arriving on the noon train.  Miller is coming to town to kill Kane, the man who sent him to prison, and a trio of his henchmen are waiting for their boss at the station.  Everyone in town, the mayor (Thomas Mitchell), the judge (Otto Kurger), and even the former marshal (Lon Chaney), all want Kane to run away.  His deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him and even when Kane goes to a church to ask for help he is turned down.  His new wife will leave him and he will have to stand by himself against Miller and his gang, but Kane cannot run away.  The quintessential camera shot in ""High Noon"" is when Kane is standing alone in the street.  Cinematographer Floyd Crosby (who had won an Oscar in 1931 for ""Tabu""), begins with a close up of Kane, sweat streaming down his face, and his hand shaking; then the camera pulls back on a crane shot to show the marshal standing all alone in the deserted street of his town.

Cooper deservedly won his second Oscar for this role and the fact that it Gary Cooper that was up there on the silver screen showing that he was afraid made all the difference in the world.  Will Kane was afraid, but he went ahead and did his job.  For audiences raised on westerns up to that time it was a shocking idea, although those who had fought in World War II could probably identify with the notion.  ""High Noon"" redefines the notion of heroism in an important way.  A man can be afraid, and still act bravely.  It is, in simple terms, a more adult conception of heroism.  This movie is also the ""24"" of its time, taking place pretty much in real time.  The wedding happens after 10 and all the clocks we see throughout the film ticking down to noon are in the ballpark, although I admit I have never timed them.  This is just a landmark film on so many levels.  For example, ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh, My Darlin'"" was the first song from a non-musical film to ever win the Oscar for Best Original Song.

There are lots of stories that have sprung up about ""High Noon.""  There are those who read ""High Noon"" as an allegory regarding those who stood up to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era and refused to cooperate with their blacklisting efforts.  Screenwriter Carl Foreman, cinematographer Floyd Crosby, and actor Lloyd Bridges were all blacklisted shortly after this film came out, which gives credence to the allegory idea although it would constitute more of a prediction.  Then there is the story that John Wayne declared the film to be ""Un-American,"" but then he picked up Cooper's Oscar for him at the Academy Awards the next year and apparently complained that he had not been offered the part (which actually had been offered to Gregory Peck first).  I am not sure that Wayne could have pulled it off, though it would have been interesting to see him try.  Jimmy Stewart did a similar role opposite the Duke in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.""",1100217600,,5616,4.591182364729459

People think this is a western classic. Wrong. ""High noon"" is surely a classic, but not a western. It only happens to be set in the old west. To say the truth,  ""High noon"" is more like a thriller with a Hitchcockian feeling to it. The western setting (violence, lack of respect for the laws, gunfights, dry and sun-scorched landscape, etc.) is present to add to the mounting tension and suspense that grow with each shot depicting the face of a clock and the relentless passage of time towards noon and the train arrival.
What makes this movie great is the seemingly dead-end situation, the great dialogues, and very good acting by Gary Cooper (which earned him an Oscar, when the Academy Awards were not given for political reasons), Grace Kelly, Lloyd Bridges, among others (and Lee Van Cleef, the infamous ""Angel Eyes"" from ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" - he doesn't say a word, but those eyes are surely creepy).
I will not give ""High noon"" five stars because I felt the script could be a little more developed. The ending is too rushed and kind of unsatisfying. But this is an excellent movie nonetheless. And, I say it again, this is not a ""western"" in the common sense of the genre.

It is truly one of the most tightly constructed films ever made. Not a single frame is wasted in the telling of its story and its conveying of mood. The film should be mandatory viewing for budding filmmakers, so they can learn the importance of lean, fat free editing. Kurosawa said he only shot footage so he could edit and high noon is truly a brilliant example of the power of concise editing. Many films today love to draw out their endings with multiple resolutions, high noon proves the power of speed and simplicity in its powerful closing scene.

Shimmering on trees is present quite a bit especially if you have a cheaper dvd player. These are minor points, because i was stunned at the beauty of the tranfer.
Sound is presented in regular and enchanced audio. Regular sometimes has cooper's dialogue a little low. Enchanced has more kick, but they may have toyed with the original mix. A commentary is including with relatives of the cast and crew. I didn't listen to all of it, it is presented in a group conversational manner.
Extras are interesting with a informative leonard maltin backstory on the film. I'm not a maltin fan and find his narration annoying, but he points out intriguing notes on the film's production. The best part is oncamera interviews from several years ago with zinneman and other real cast/crew member. Zinneman tells a great story about how the train ran over the camera when they were shooting the railroad track shots. Also another weird note is that the cinematography floyd crosby is david crosby's father! David is interviewed about his dad's work. A new series of interviews are collected with the surviving children of the cast/crew in the ""behind"" doc. Cooper's daughter is very obviously reading a teleprompt and i quit watching at that point. There is a radio show with tex ritter, he talks about having never played the bad guy and being in 80 westerns. I didn't finish the show.
The movie is by my money the best western ever made because of its extraordinary concise editing and fat free storytelling. The dvd is great with knock out picture for a film over 50 years old and a good documentary on the making of.",1079308800,,2949,4.673076923076923
3395909,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is the quintessential Hollywood western.  It will continue to represent the genre for many decades to come.

It stars Gary Cooper, one of the most beloved of leading men who personified soft-spoken heroic courage in scores of important films, including Beau Geste (1939), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Along Came Jones (1945), The Court Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955), etc., and Grace Kelly in her debut role.  Directed by Fred Zinneman, whose credits include From Here to Eternity (1953), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Julia (1977) and a dozen more, High Noon tells the story of Will Kane, a small town marshal who, on his wedding day faces a man just let out of prison with three of his outlaw friends who are aiming to get revenge for his being sent up.

The enduring image of the film is Gary Cooper walking tall in the deserted streets of the town in a black Western hat, a black vest, long-sleeved white shirt, black string necktie, watch chain, boots, and low slung holster and two belts, while off to the side inside the wooden buildings we see ""that big hand move along, nearin' high noon""--which is when the train arrives carrying the freed prisoner.

Will Kane has cleaned up the town, but now the gunslingers return and he is their target.  His wife of less than an hour (Kelly) demands that he leave town.  The town itself, in fear of the gunmen, also wants him to leave town, hoping to take the fight away from them.  He tries to recruit deputies but everyone is afraid.  Even his lone deputy (Lloyd Bridges) deserts him.  In the background is Dimitri Tiomkin's haunting ballad, sung by Tex Ritter: ""Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling (On This Our Wedding Day).""  Both Cooper and the song won Oscars.  Noteworthy was the fine performance by Kay Jurado as ... Ramirez, Cane's ex, a shrewd barroom lady and proprietress.

What is interesting about the moral conflict (from the story, ""The Tin Star"" as interpreted for film by screenwriter Carl Foreman), that of facing your enemy rather than running, is that Kane's rationale is logical.  If he runs they will only come after him again and again.  Only two people get this, Kane and Ramirez.  The larger moral issue of whether to fight to defend yourself (Grace Kelly is cast as a Quaker and does not believe in killing) is resolved during the climatic shootout by Grace Kelly's character herself in a manner that did not set well with Quakers.

How well does this black and white classic Western play today?  The town people seem cliches and the outlaws are quickly drawn, but Gary Cooper as Will Kane seems entirely believable, admirable, heroic in the best sense of the term as a man who knows the dangers, feels the fear, and yet must act, and he does.  He is no shallow, two-fisted, machine-gun hero so often seen in Hollywood productions, but a man of maturity whose ""grace under pressure"" (a fine definition of courage) tells us and himself who he really is.

See this for Gary Cooper whose ""slow-talking, slow-walking,"" (lyrics from the Coaster's hit song from the fifties, ""And Along Came Jones""), and soft-spoken heroics delighted and enthralled a couple of generations of film-goers.",1075939200,,3164,4.728597449908925

3395912,5,B0016MLIKM,"I saw this at age 8 when it was a brand-new, my-gosh piece of controversy.  In fact, I saw it six times and the house was packed at each showing.  Many powerful images have stayed in my head since then, and they are just as impressive today.  Recall that the ""controversy"" behind this classic was its timing at the height of McCarthy's Red scare; the writers and directors, their creativity stymied by myopic thinking and fears of the day, pulled quite a stunt; the hero Will Kane marches to a different drummer in the face of a skittish and conformist environment.  Politics aside, of course, this is just a rattling good movie.  It started a new trend, which in those days was referred to as the ""adult"" Western, which in turn meant it dealt with ideas, principles, real-world emotions, not just horses and guns.  Take it as an allegory of 50's culture or as a great Western, it works either way.  Even its presentation style was a rule-breaker: starts with Tex Ritter droning ""Do Not Forsake Me O My Darlin'"" in the background, after which every Hollywood Western had to have a Western singer in the credits (unfortunately, it was usually a near-screaming, echo-chambered Frankie Lane with a blaring symphony orchestra backup! Good grief).  The 1952 masterpiece was followed by countless imitations -- and how many Eastwood movies feature High Noon-style confrontations ?  It's a landmark film so well done, it defies imitation.  The DVD print is quite good, but the ""digitized"" sound is awful, as usual (turn it off, play it in the original mono).  Catch the fight scene with Cooper and Bridges, and the scenes with skillful Katy Jurado and her competing suitors; it doesn't get any more real than this, and veteran director Zinnemann outdoes himself here.  Every performance is tight and right-on.  And note: the action occurs in real time.  You can synchronize your wrist watch to the brief glances at the clocks on the walls.  And dig that camera work; black and white was an art in those days, and has become a lost art since.  A stirring, original, and unique work in every way.  Some good features on the Collectors Edition.",1074038400,,2134,4.771117166212534
3395913,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a very difficult film to review, most of us have seen it, and likely more than once.  The best thing to try and do here is justifying the purchase.  For one thing it's a clean digitized version from the original negative.  Not all DVDs are, many to the regret of buyers.  It has a lot of extra's, interviews and making of specials.  It's often fun to watch a good film again, after we know all the ""inside stuff"".
What makes this film so watchable for repeat viewings?  This movie plays to our emotions, on so many different levels.  It's reaffirmation of a man, doing his duty as a man.  Much like the patriot, who fights for God and country! To watch it again, is to once again reaffirm your own manliness and resolve.  It's a study of different male natures, and raw motivations. Those who would join the fight if they were to benefit.  Friends, who are there for you until circumstances look a bit too dire.  The nave young boy, who would enter the fight without knowing the consequences. To the political arm of the town who tried to convince Kane to run, knowing the trouble would likely follow him, and pass them by.
The women in the story are just as interesting.  You have the Pure young Quaker wife, (who's religious convictions would normally preclude violence of any kind) reluctantly coming to grips with reality of the situation.  You have the scarlet woman, who recognizes the rare value of Kane's heroic nature. They've had an obvious relationship in the past, but likely she could never meet him on equal grounds of morality. The wives who hide out in the church, and help squelch any male support from the townsmen.  Their motivation is simple enough, they know someone will likely get shot, and they'd rather their men did not participate.
This particular edition is not released yet as I write this, so I haven't confirmed this.  I do believe one of the commentaries (some which have aired on TV before) mentions the unlikely case this could have happened at the time presented in the film.  If I recall, they explained that most towns of this type were full of ex-civil war vets, who would have had no qualms what-so-ever about taking up guns, to help the Marshall. This may be true, but it's not the point of the film.  In the end, Kane drops his tin star in the dirt, and appears to turn his back on the town in disgust.  I had some thoughts about that, but always believed that his disgust was not over the betrayal of the town.  I thought he believed that the town betrayed themselves, and was disgusted with the thought of it.
I did wonder one more thing at the end of the movie.  Since Kane's' wife jumped off the train, just as it was leaving the station, how did she get all her luggage back, and loaded up in that wagon right after the gunfight?  The airlines could use baggage handlers that good!",1073174400,,2835,4.487329434697855
3395934,5,B0016MLIKM,"One of my favorite movies of all time is this suspenseful Western starring Gary Cooper.  It is a simple tale told in a complex and artistic manner.  A man retires as the town Marshall and marries a Quaker (the main reason for his retirement).  On the day of their wedding, word comes that a man he sent away to prison (Frank Miller) has been released and is heading to his town to settle the score.  The ex-Marshall, Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), first leaves with his new bride but turns around to meet the challenge.  He initially assumes that he will not have to meet Frank Miller alone.  However, when he looks to put together some deputies, only one man volunteers and once that man realizes that he is the only volunteer, he quits as well.  Knowing that Frank Miller will be accompanied by two henchmen, Kane is face with the reality that he will have to face the challenge alone and out-gunned.  The stage is thus set for a suspenseful gun battle.
Naturally, good triumphs over evil; this is a 1952 movie afterall.  However, the movie shows that not all is well within what we consider to represent good.  Why was Kane left to meet this fight alone?  Even his newlywed bride gave him an ultimatim of her of the shootout.  This concept of one man standing alone amidst cowardice and apathy angered the likes of John Ford and John Wayne (although it didn't keep the Duke from accepting Cooper's Best Actor Oscar on his behalf).  World War II was still vivid in everyone's memory and it was a memory of America coming to the rescue; not kicking and screaming but marching proudly.  Yet this movie was not an analogy of WWII but of the McCarthy Era where the suggestion was that fear intimidated the populace and kept them from speaking up when individuals were challenged.
Irregardless of your thoughts on the film's deeper meaning, this is a tour-de-force by Cooper. His stoic strength in the face of fear is a preformance for the ages.  Cooper does not come across as a man full of himself.  He shows that he has weaknesses but he struggles, successfully, to confront them.  He is Everyman who must face his fears, not some Superman who has no fear.  The movie builds in suspense as he becomes increasingly aware of his lonely mission.  Then the suspense jump-starts to a higher level as everything awaits the arrival of Frank Miller on the noon train.  I can hear the music of the soundtrack accentuate the suspense and the train whistle blowing the arrival of Fate.  The shoot out itself is subdued somewhat in scope reminding us that it is Everyman and not Superman who is battling the enemy.  The final scene is as dramatic in symbolism as the shoot-out was in action.
As time, tastes, an technology move on, many once-great movies fall by the wayside.  ""High Noon"" is a movie for all ages and all times.  The acting, directing, musical score, supporting acting, writing et. al. are all superb.  If you haven't scene this movie, you're missing a classic.

3395935,4,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is considered one of the best westerns ever made, there are many reasons why this movie is so appealing. The first thing that the audience notices is the great cast, everybody did a great job, there isn't a single weak performance. ""High Noon"" has 2 superstars from that decade: Gary Cooper & Grace Kelly.

 The plot of the movie is very good and interesting, and as the film moves forward it gets more and more interesting. By the way, ""High Noon"" was filmed in ""real time"", because everything happens according to the time in the watch.

 During the last 25 minutes of the movie, the suspense grows increasingly until the movie reaches the climax, so the film gets better every minute.

3395937,5,B0016MLIKM,"Tex Ritter's Oscar-winning theme song is heard throughout reflecting the abandonment Marshal Will Kane feels when the town of Hadleyville refuses to help him face down some gunmen itching for revenge.  The aerial shot of him standing alone in the streets of Hadleyville exemplifies the struggle he faces.
Thing is, he didn't have to go back.  He just got married to Amy, a nice Quaker woman, handed in his badge on his retirement day, and was about to embark on a new life until he gets word that three gunmen are awaiting the noon train bringing home Frank Miller, an outlaw Kane once arrested and sent to prison, now released.  However, Kane feels a burning responsibility to face them, and he returns, much to the chagrin of his wife.  One, even if he did flee, they would track him down, being the vindictive men they are.  Two, Kane's replacement won't arrive until tomorrow, and he doesn't want even a ""dirty little village in the middle of nowhere"" to become embroiled in chaos for even one day under Miller.
However, not a finger is lifted to help him.  Harvey, a deputy sheriff, is sore at Kane for not being selected as the latter's replacement.  Others are friends of Miller.  Most of the time, they acknowledge the great service Kane has done for them as marshal, but at the same time, they say he was stupid for coming back, thinking that it would be the new marshal's responsibility to handle Miller and his thugs.  They're also scared <rhymes with witless> as well.
That brings open the question of responsibility.  The citizens of Hadleyville bicker about whether it's the local government or the state government that's responsible for stopping criminals.  And if no one is willing to do so due to cowardice or denial, who else will?  Kane thus seems to be the only person willing to take that burden.  As Helen Ramirez, a former flame of Kane, points out, ""When he dies, this town will die too.""  Despite her heart of steel, she does show some support for Kane in the end.
Then there's the issue of pacifism versus self-defense.  It brings the question, when is it right to resort to violence?  When one is attacked?  When you see someone being attacked?  Also, the complaint that the judges and juries set free criminals captured by lawmen still rings true today.
Gary Cooper deservedly won the Best Actor statue for his role as Will Kane.  And I'm not exactly a big fan of Grace Kelly but she did remarkably well in her first starring role.  Maybe it's because she played a Quaker and I lean towards non-violence, or that line of hers on guns:  ""I don't care who's right or who's wrong.  There's got to be some better way for people to live.""
 Given his resemblance to a certain contemporary White House occupant, Lloyd Bridges's portrayal of Harvey made me cringe somewhat.  However, Katy Jurado as the resolute, steel-hearted Helen Ramirez gets honours as a fiercely independent woman who has to struggle with being a Mexican amid whites and a business owner as well.
Many of the other supporting cast are worth mentioning.  Lon Chaney Jr. as Martin, Will's old mentor is one.  Harry Morgan, later to become Colonel Potter in MASH, has a small role as Sam Fuller.
I also had fun keeping track of the time on the various clocks, be it the courthouse, barber shop, or Helen's room.  Obviously, all three don't tell the exact same time, but I kept time there was a ten-minute discrepancy on my clock from the time in the courthouse, 10:40 AM, to noon.  I usually never watch Westerns anymore, but this classic was a rare exception to the rule.",1061424000,,3562,4.656
3395938,5,B0016MLIKM,"By now, other reviewers have said all there is to say about the plotline and virtually everything else concerning this movie.  I'll simply add a personal experience in support of my vote that this is probably the best film of all time.
I first saw the film with my parents at a drive in.  I was six.  That was 50 years ago. I was fascinated by the movie and the music at the time and remain so to this day.
I make it a point to watch High Noon again at least once a year and never tire of it.  If anything, it gets better with repeated viewing.  Repeated viewing provides an appreciation of the lesser things that help make this such a masterpiece--the great job the supporting actors did, the use of the music, the clock, the chair, etc. to build the tension until it becomes almost unbearable by the time the first whistle of the noon train sounds.
One of my favorite scenes--In a role often overlooked, Katy Jurado as Helen Ramirez telling Harve, played by Lloyd Bridges, ""You are a nice looking boy, Harve.  You have beeg, strong shoulders.  But it takes more than beeg, strong shoulders to make a man.  Will Kane is a man.""  Wow! Every line, every glance, every moment of this film is exceptional.
At that first viewing 50 years ago, when the moment came when Kane fingers his badge and looks at the approaching townspeople, my quiet, proper mother blurted loudly at the screen, ""Throw it down in the dirt!""  You had to know my mother, but a film which could get her to do that is truly powerful.
Has the film aged well?  Allow me to offer as evidence that it has, the repeated references to it by none other than Tony Soprano in HBO's The Sopranos.  ""Whateva happened to Gary Coopa?  The strong, quiet type.  Just do what hadda be done.""  The first time Tony makes this statement, you think he means Gary Cooper the actor in his common quiet, but strong roles. By season four, however, Tony adds to his repeated, ""Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?"" line, ""He faced down the Miller gang when none of those blankety blanks from town would help him.""  You realize then that Tony means, not Gary Cooper, but Will Kane in High Noon.  Now, that's an enduring legacy for a great, great film!",1059609600,,2190,4.435

3395940,5,B0016MLIKM,"In The Divine Comedy, Dante reserves the last and worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserve their neutrality. I thought about that when recently seeing this film again. In brief, here's the situation. Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) learns that Frank Miller has been released from prison and will arrive on the noon train when it stops in Hadleyville. Joined by others, Miller then intends to locate the marshall and kill him. For various reasons, everyone in town abandons Kane...including his newlywed wife Amy (Kelly) and his deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges). Of course, Kane is tempted to leave with his new bride before noon and avoid Miller...but he doesn't. As high noon approaches, he finds himself alone and facing almost certain death. Cooper received and deserved his Academy Award for best actor. His performance in this film may well have been the best in his entire career. Especially effective use is made of the theme song ""Do Not Forsake Me [The Ballad of High Noon]"" co-written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington (sung off-camera by Tex Ritter), the key component of Tiomkin's music score which received an Academy Award. The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Bridges, Katy Jurado (Helen Ramirez), and Lon Chaney, Jr. (Martin Howe). Working with Carl Foreman's screenplay, director Fred Zinnemann focuses on what was (more than 50 years ago) a very controversial idea: that otherwise good people would refuse to support their marshal when he and their town are threatened by cold-blooded killers. John Wayne was among those who called this film ""Un-American."" Several of the townspeople can be accused of cowardice but that is not true of Amy Kane, a pacifist whose principles require her to oppose her husband's decision to remain. The final scene in the street is unforgettable. Whatever we may think, today, of Kane's decision and of those who oppose it or who remain neutral, we can nonetheless agree that this film still attracts and then sustains our interest; also, that our sense of dramatic tension increases with each passing moment.",1058745600,,2088,5.0726744186046515

About to retire and move away from Hadleyville, Kane marries Amy, a Quaker(Grace Kelly plays the part of Kane's new bride). But before he can leave, he learns that Frank Miller, a wild gunman and murderer, has been released from prison. Miller vowed that he would return to Hadleyville one day and that he would kill Kane for sending him to prison. As Kane gets ready to leave, he learns that Miller's old gang is waiting at the train station, where Miller is due at noon.

Rather than run, Kane decides to stay. This infuriates Amy, who fears that she'll be a widow before the day is out. Her Quaker religion  forbids her to use violence as a means to settle disputes.

Kane searches the town for deputies to help him put a stop to Miller. But no one will help. Kane is alone. Even Amy says she's leaving on the train that will bring Miller to Hadleyville. What will Kane do?

Throughout this film, shot in gritty black and white, Tex Ritter's haunting ""Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darling"" plays in the background, adding to the ever-present drama and tension.",1054684800,,1207,4.518348623853211
3395944,4,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper was at his career best in quietly defining the emotional turmoil of an honorable lawman who finds little encouragment and support from the very people he has selflessly served for years. Though off the professional hook because of his newly-wed status and a new life in a world away from law enforcement, Will Kane could not easily avoid taking on armed responsibility one last time.
""High Noon"" perfectly defined timeless if unpleasant elements of human behavior that can at times infuriate, confuse, frustrate,  and even sabotage the best of honorable intentions. When people herd, they can always find a way of rationalizing aversion to getting involved for the greater good and can become quite clever in explaining away personal cowardice. As the noon hour drew closer, Kane finally sought out the help of his long time mentor and retired fellow lawman who succinctly noted that ""deep down, people don't care, they just don't care."" Anyway, age and arthritic hands made his armed support a moot point.
This film is a relevant today as when released just over 50 years ago.  In some ways, even more so.  Few films capture so elegantly what it is to find ones self in dire circumstances so utterly alone.
Facing such a defining moment takes an uncommon courage and a real character to fight long odds of probable defeat.  Not much is so really different in today's politically charged climate, not really.  Will Kane's strength and courage of conviction will never go out of style, but alas, will always be  in short supply.",1050537600,,1539,4.9
3395945,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" surprised me with its quality.  I was expecting a good Western, but I was not expecting a multi-layered, metaphorical and psychological drama.  This is genre storytelling at its finest, using the setting of a Western to tell a more far-reaching story.
Short, ringing in at only 84 minutes, ""High Noon"" manages to capture a complete tale in glances, unspoken dialog, gestures and implied content.  Filmed in real time, there is a tense urgency as well as a melancholy finality.  The clock ticks towards high noon, and nothing will stop it.
Gary Cooper is excellent as a retiring hero, past his prime but still willing to stand up for his principles.  He is a living example of the saying ""better to light a single candle than to curse the darkness.""  He risks everything to light his candle.  Grace Kelley is just beautiful.

Director Fred Zinnemann effectively uses clocks to convey the time ticking away towards the battle.  The movie is filled with tension as the showdown draws near and Mr. Cooper brilliantly plays his part for which he won his second Best Actor Oscar.  Tex Ritter, John's father, sings the Oscar winning song, ""Don't Forsake Me"" which perfectly captures the essence of the film.  High Noon is not only a classic western, but a classic American film.",1039478400,,1394,4.44488188976378
3395949,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a truly great film, to say nothing of a great western. The scenario is classic. An aging lawman gets married to a sweet angelic woman and decides to give up his dangerous life chasing lawbreakers. But on the same day that he gets married and is supposed to give up his star, a man he sent up the river (and naturally vowed to kill him one day) is arriving in town on the noon train. And he ain't alone. Not a bad premise for a western. But that's just the start.
This movie also has a truly perfect cast who all give great performances. In fact, many people's carreers in movies started or were greatly furthered by this film. But great acting deserves great direction, cinematography, and editing. And that my friends, is where this movie truly shines. Practically every time you enter a room, you can see a clock on the wall, ticking away the time till noon. From the time that the Marshall enters the town the second time, everything practically unrolls in real time. And as his situation gets more and more desperate and the time of reckoning gets closer and closer, the tension is fantastic.
The music (which won a well-deserved academy award) is the icing on the cake. The movie opens with a ballad pretty much telling you the entire plot in a few verses. This song plays again and again in key sequences. This may seem redundant to some, but to me this just heightens the emotional pull. And when the marshall walks into the saloon and the same song is being played on the piano...it's just perfect. This song is the theme of the movie, and adds a great surrealistic element to an already awesome movie.
Of course this review would not be complete if I did not at least one or two words about the dvd itself. Well the sound is excellent. Crisp and clean. But the picture is amazing. This movie and the French version of Beauty and the Beast (released by the mighty Criterion) are the two finest examples of black and white picture perfection I have ever seen. The picture is so CLEAN. There are some who feel that dvds can actually surpass the quality of movies seen in a theater, dvds like this are the reason why. If you never have seen this movie before, you owe it to yourself to at least rent it on dvd. If you like the movie, then you have to have this dvd. The picture is perfection.

3395952,5,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon is a magnificent film.  It is textually rich, multi-layered, incredibly well-acted (particularly Gary Cooper,) well-directed/edited, and portrays adults rather than adolescents-with-attitude, which seems to be the hallmark of so many modern American movies. The film was written by Carl Foreman and directed by Fred Zinneman, both highly intelligent and mature individuals with something quite important to say.  That gets us to the multi-layered aspect of the film.  Yes, it is a morality play about responsibility, fear, the vagaries of duty, and society's hypocrisy/cowardice. However, it is a great movie because when you get right down to the basics, it is a compelling, character-driven drama about a man making very difficult choices under very difficult conditions.  It is particularly poignant when Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) is trying--and failing--to enlist the townspeople's help for the showdown that will occur at high noon when the train arrives carrying his mortal enemy.  Kane's feelings are complex:  scared, hurt, angry, vacillating, defiant and fatalistic.  As he walks back to his office, a group of children are playing and one boy falls against him as another boy points a wooden stick and shouts, ""Bang, bang, you're dead Will Kane.""  These children are his neighbors. He has known, and served, their parents for years.  How would you feel?  Well, unlike most movies that shy away from complex human emotions, Kane feels like most of us would feel--he feels those same complex emotions I mentioned above--and so does the viewer.  A rare experience in film.",1032307200,,1591,5.349397590361446

3395974,4,B0016MLIKM,"Some have stated that the transfer of ""High Noon"" to DVD was done at the wrong aspect ratio.  Well, don't shy away from the purchase of this DVD because this is not correct.  The first widescreen movie, unless you stretch the definition to fit Abel Gance's unique Triptych sequences in 1927 for ""Napoleon,"" was in 1953 with ""The Robe.""  The aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1 or 4 to 3 (i.e. your standard TV set) is nearly correct for ""High Noon"" (go to the link [...] for details).
Now, if you want to see what happens to the aspect ratio of some films, see what's missing from the DVD and theatrical release of ""The Remains of the Day.""  James Ivory used the Super 35 process - the size of the original negative being 35 mm - so the film could easily be moved to tape or television without Panning and Scanning.  Ironically, there is far more image on the top and bottom on my VHS tape than in the theatrical release or DVD version.
Though the full camera negative was not meant to be shown in theatres because movie house screens usually take full advantage of their width, sometimes at the expense of a cropped top and bottom, to present a larger picture, on a traditional television screen the full 35 mm image has superior composition and feels far less cramped.  I feel it compliments aspects of the story, revealing more details.  Naturally, you can't say this about many films meant to be shown at 2.35 to 1 or greater.
I apologize for using so much space on this subject in a review dedicated to ""High Noon,""  but I want to make clear that just because a DVD says ""widescreen"" it doesn't necessarily mean you are seeing more of the image than you saw on your old VHS tape, though it usually does.  Conversely, if someone says a film should have been released on DVD in its widescreen format, don't believe them without checking it out at [...]  There may not be a widescreen version.
Regarding ""High Noon,"" I feel it is a compelling western that deftly uses the ""man alone"" theme to not only build suspense, but to build character, so to speak, as those who faced the charges before the House Un-American Activities Committee had theirs built.  Yes, Gary Cooper is apprehensive, even a bit scared, but he has the character to come through it all.
Despite John Wayne's indictment of the film as un-American, I think it is just the opposite, upholding the integrity of the individual when confronted by those who know no such integrity, either actively or passively.  Still, as a western, John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" broke new ground and ""High Noon"" did not.  Yes, having the action take place in real time is unusual but hardly unique.  It was done just as well three years earlier in Robert Wise's ""The Set-up,"" a sadly dismissed film of boxing and human courage.  And when ""High Noon"" is compared to the major works of America cinema like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""It Happened One Night,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Hustler,"" ""The Godfather"" (I and II), ""The General,"" ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" ""The Apartment""  and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or the masterworks of British cinema like ""The Third Man,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or one of my favorites, ""I Know Where I'm Going"" it must lose a half a star and maybe more.  Of course, I'm a tough grader.",1031270400,,3332,4.591905564924114
3395975,5,B0016MLIKM,"This a good western, but an even better movie. This movie is different from a John Wayne movie. The heroe admits he's afraid. There's no Elmer Bernstein orchestra blaring the credit, just Merle Travis playing the guitar, Cliffie Stone on bass, while Tex Ritters sings. There's none of the John Ford's great scenery. The west looks desolate in this movie. And little action. That's a warning to all teens who think that something has to blow up every few minutes.
  This a Frank Capra western, except unlike ""It's A Wonderful Life"" where the friends come to rescue to hero, everyone forgets the heroe. The emphasis is placed on building suspense and great characterization.  Sure they talk about what a good man he is, but noone wants to help except...  It has a short documentary as an extra. It's a shame that an audio commentary couldn't be provided by the some living character actors. Also I wish they could have shown two scenes that were deleted from the film. Overall, the number #1 reason to buy this DVD, is for the movie itself with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly in her first major role. The score, the acting, the black and white color, the good vs. evil theme, the ticking clock, and the long shots of a lonely marshall by himself makes this a classic.",1028505600,,1262,4.620535714285714

  Quite sadly Republic Entertainment produced the DVD in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio to fit your TV, instead of preserving the original theatrical aspect ratio (letterbox).  The clipping off the edges of scenes or worse still the characters faces was distracting throughout the movie.  Basically ruining an otherwise enjoyable movie experience. Personally I think releasing a DVD without at least the option of the original aspect ratio for any movie, let alone a Hollywood classic, should be a criminal offense.  This is unforgivable.  Shame.
If you have to satisfy your High Noon jones, rent it and return it.  Don't waste your money or shelf space on a bad DVD release of an otherwise fine film.

3395978,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper is one of an handful of actors whose strong moral compass never fails to ring true. From his earliest films in the silent era right up till his last works, Gary Cooper continually shows the viewer some lessons right out of Acting 101. He makes it look so easy, how to radiate controlled fear while disguising it as bland bravery. In HIGH NOON, Cooper learns a brutal lesson that everyone in the film well knew. In a moment of crisis, you can't count on ordinary folk for help. Ironically, it is the evil ones who are made of the required stern stuff to face a six-gun.
When Cooper, who plays Marshall Will Kane, learns that a recently released from prison convict is returning to town to settle a grudge against him, Cooper tries to enlist the aid of anyone who can help. His friends, his deputy, even his wife fail to recognize the code that forms the bulk of his core. Just as his friends feel they cannot help him, Cooper is just as impelled to the opposite. By movie's end, he meets the bad guys, kills them, and then is stunned to realize that as this external battle has ended, a far more complex internal one is just beginning.
 HIGH NOON stands out as a masterpiece, partly due to Cooper, but also to a fine supporting cast which acts as universal lightning rods to attract a swirling torrent of fear, from which not even Cooper is immune. Lon Chaney as the cowardly politician, LLoyd Bridges as the equally cowardly deputy, Katy Jurado as the Mexican woman who once loved Kane but has lost him to Grace Kelly all shine in roles that require them to walk a fine line between bouncing off Kane with just the right force to serve as a dramatic foil and yet not divert the audience's attention for too long as Kane sees who they are and what he must be.
 HIGH NOON is no subtle exploration of the different essences that separate hero from villain from coward. This movie delineates in a starkness that matches the black and white filming the need for even a brave man to look within to find the strength that others routinely know is missing in them but take for granted in him.",1025308800,,2096,4.427461139896373
3395979,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is one of my favorite westerns and that is high praise since I normally do not like westerns, it takes a lot for a movie in the genre to impress me. An instant classic, in recent years this film has been maligned. From what I understand, most of the negative feeling is because the movie has been so hyped. It is unfair to hype a movie so much since it raises impossible expectations. I was fortunate enough to have somehow missed the hyping. (Odd, since I love old movies) So when I saw this movie at the rental store, I vaguely remembered hearing it was good so I got it.
The plot involves a lawman who will not leave town when he hears a killer he put in jail is released and will arrive on the noon train. His life falls apart, his friends abandon him, his wife leaves him but his honor will not allow him to leave. If this plot sounds cool, you will probably enjoy this movie. If not, you may want to try something else. You either accept the concept or you don't.
Watching the movie, several things impressed me.
First, I was impressed by Gary Cooper's acting. This was the first movie I ever saw him in and his anguish and nobility are just great. He richly deserved his oscar. The other standout is Katy Jurado as Cooper's old flame. While some racial bariers were coming down in the 50s, it was still very refreshing to see a Mexican character played by a Mexican actress in a movie of that time. She adds a note of authenticity to the movie that would not have been there otherwise and her performance is flawless.
Second, I enjoyed the fact that movie was black and white. Color films of the era were candy colored, almost too bright, which is fine for a comedy or a musical but kind of ruins historic movies for me.
Third, the suspense kept me glued to the screen until the last moment. And the ending was just great.
Whew! I guess I can see why so many critics hyped this movie! Well, don't let anyone else influence you. Try this movie out for yourself and draw your own conclusions.",1024790400,,2002,4.312997347480106
3395980,5,B0016MLIKM,"In 1952 writer Carl Foreman, director Fred Zinnemann, cinematographer Floyd Crosby and producer Stanley Kramer created a one-off recipe for a new kind of western.  The ingredients; Gary Cooper, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Grace Kelly, Lon Chaney, Henry and Otto Kruger interwoven with an unforgettable ballad written by Dimitri Tiomkin/Ned Washington and sung by Tex Ritter. The result is a movie with every second to be savoured.
Made at a time when sprawling landscaped Technicolor shoot-em-up westerns were the norm, High Noon was filmed in high contrast black and white.
Much of the film`s tension and excitement is due to the fact that each desperate minute that passes on screen is virtually equal to real time heightened by ever closening shots of clocks as noon approaches.
Marshall Will Kane is played faultlessly by Gary Cooper in probably his finest role.  Kane,  afraid, yet courageous and dutiful to his friends and townsfolk finds that, in his hour of need, they turn their backs on him. Kane`s anguished face was not all acting because Gary Cooper was suffering from a bleeding ulcer during filming and was concerned over the fight scene with Lloyd Bridges because of back problems.
A film of loyalty and of betrayal in which Kane is torn between his new wife, Amy (Grace Kelly) and his duty when he tells her
Kane:They`re making me run.  I`ve never run from anybody before.
Amy: I don`t understand any of this.
Kane: (looking at his vest watch) Well, I haven`t got time to tell ya.
Crucially, as time passes and tension builds, she speaks to Kane`s old flame, Helen Ramirez (played by Katy Jurado)
Helen: If Kane was my man, I`d never leave him like this.  I`d get a gun. I`d fight.
Amy:  Why don`t you?
Helen:  He is not my man. He`s yours.
When Kane does win through, with, finally,  Amy`s help, his so-called friends then rally round to congratulate him. With contempt he throws his star in the dust and drives off with Amy.
1952 was also `McCarthy` time. To some, unfortunately very influential people, High Noon was seen as `un-American`.  Not long after writing the script, Carl Foreman was blacklisted. Listed too was Lloyd Bridges who didn`t work for a few years after and of course Floyd Crosby (after all he had filmed it!).
High Noon is not only one of the best westerns ever made but one of the finest films ever created. Beautiful photography, outstanding minimalistic direction and taught editing with a screenplay magnificently performed by a superb cast.
There can be few people who have not seen High Noon and even fewer who can recall the outstanding original theatrical print having viewed it only on VHS or as a tv broadcast.
This DVD has transferred the sparkling high contrast images seen on the original 35mm negative. The image and sound quality of this DVD  breathes new life into a classic making it as fresh and thrilling as it ever was.

3395981,4,B0016MLIKM,"This 1952 western is a classic.  It earned Gary Cooper and academy award and also won for best film editing, best song and best musical score. I was very young when I first saw it and I remember being impressed.  And I don't think I can ever forget the song. Now, fifty years later, it's time to revisit it.
Well, one thing is clear.  I still love the song.  And it's no wonder that it's so memorable.  It's performed over and over throughout the film.  The words tell the whole story, simply and completely. The melody is haunting and a perfect background for the story, which also seems simple but deals with big themes - the struggle between good and evil, loyalty and betrayal, courage and cowardice and what it is to be a man.
Gary Cooper is cast in the role of the Sheriff, who has just wed his bride, Grace Kelly, and is giving up his badge because she is a Quaker.  He's been a good sheriff, brought peace and prosperity to the town.  But now, a man he had sent to jail five years previously has been pardoned instead of being hanged and has sworn to kill the sheriff.  Now he's coming back to town on the noon train. There's tension in the air, especially since three of the killer's outlaw friends have just ridden into town. The film is shot in real time, as the audience experiences the ticking of the clock as the big hands move towards the inevitable showdown.
Of course there are complications.  Grace Kelly refuses to support her new husband and buys a ticket on the train out of town.  A young hotshot deputy, Lloyd Bridges, who is romancing Cooper's former girlfriend, brilliantly played by Katy Jurado, gets into a fistfight with him. But mostly, it's the townspeople who turn away from him in his hour of need and most of the film consists of Cooper going from barroom to church trying to enlist a posse to help him.  Everyone turns their backs on him.  And when the showdown comes he's all alone.  It's a brilliant performance as we see the disappointment on his face over and over again and his expression of determination to stand tall and refuse to run away.  Cooper was 51 years old at the time and shows every bit of it.  There are lines in his face, bags under his eyes and looseness to his flesh. It's a refreshing reality in these days of plastic surgical perfection.  Grace Kelly, who was 23 at the time, is pretty but her performance rather stiff.  This was her first big role though and brought her the attention she needed as she established her career.
I felt the tension as the clock ticked away, enjoyed the clarity of the story.  I, too, counted the minutes till the whistle of the train and the bad guy stepped off.  However, at that point I fell asleep and when I awoke the film had just ended.  I was annoyed with myself.  But I glad this was a video and I could re-wind and watch it again.  And so I did, forcing myself to stay awake.  I then realized that it wasn't just because I was sleepy that I fell asleep.  The actual showdown was boring to me.  Fifty years of watching movies since then has spoiled me.  I just can't feel tension in this kind of gun battle in which the conclusion is evident.  This of course is not the fault of the film.  In the context of its time, it must have been great.  And it still holds up as a classic and that's why I give it an unqualified recommendation.  It's just a little hard to go back into a 1952 mindset.",1019260800,,3390,4.333333333333333

The beautiful theme music and the great performances by the rest of the cast make this the greatest western of all time. Noboby who enjoys films should miss this jewel. This is about a man who ignores every excuse,overcomes his very real human fears and does the right thing. The fact that his heroism is unappreciated does not matter,as we know it should not.

3395983,2,B0016MLIKM,"April 6, 2002
  I don't remember the exact quote, but I once saw a
 documentary on filmmaker Howard Hawks wherein the great
director finally explained to me why 'High Noon' is the one
supposedly classic western for which I have no patience.  It
went something like this:
  ""'High Noon?'  I hate that movie.""
  The interviewer did a double take.  Why? he asked.
  ""Because the Gary Cooper character is a joke.  He's not
serious about his work.  He's not a professional.  Grace Kelly
saves his lily-livered guts.""
  Aha!
  Mr. Hawks and I are not the only ones dissatisfied
with 'High Noon.'  I recall that screenwriter William Goldman
('Adventures In The Screen Trade') also holds it in low esteem.
  Now I'm not overly fond of the ""unbeatable"" heroes of the
 so-called Spaghetti westerns.  Nor am I favorable to John
Wayne's overbearing screen persona when the film is
mediocre.  ""Unbeatable"" western heroes are just too darn, well,
 unbeatable.  Not to mention too unflappable.  Not to mention
too expert at their trade by half, able to hit bad guys all day
long and half a mile away with a rusty Colt peacemaker.  But, at
 the same time, no other western has ever had a hero as pale and
 insufferable as Gary Cooper in 'High Noon.'
  Sure, if three guys were coming to kill me, I'd do just
what he does in the movie.  I'd run around looking for help, and
 when I didn't get it, I'd end up just like Mr. Cooper; I'd be
pretty worried.  Scratch that.  I'd be wetting my boots.
  So it's a perfectly reasonable argument that 'High Noon' is
 one darn realistic western.
  But who wants to watch Gary Cooper run around like that for
 two hours?
  Sheesh.

The plot line is simple.  The sheriff (Gary Cooper) has just married a Quaker (Grace Kelly), and promised to retire.  That same day the ""bad guy"" gets out of prison and arrives in town.  We all know the rest of the story, the sheriff stays, defeats the bad guys, retires, and leaves.
If that was all there was, it would be a good western.  It's the rest of the story that makes it great, not only as a western, but also as a classic.  The story is told in close to 'real time'and yet it covers years of history.  The woman who has been associated with three main characters (the bad guy, the sheriff, and the current deputy) and helps us understand all of them.  The town fathers who are suddenly unavailable when the sheriff could use help.

Because this movie does not claim to be a classic in each take. Gary Cooper, of course, is unmatched in his splendid performance. Nevertheless, you see and feel his urge to contribute to a movie that wants nothing but to dominate the oscar show. Zinnemann and his cast succeeded. But what Skerritt and the other striking actors achieved is a modern classic. The scenery in Canada is far better than the 1952-background. This movie has a relaxed pace and Skerritt here is at the height of his art. The only other nowadays actor I can imagine in that role would be Sam Shepard. The story sticks very closely to Carl Foreman's original, many dialogues you can thus be directly compared. But now, the shootout was improved a lot.

3396002,5,B0016MLIKM,"Some years ago I had the opportunity to develop a viewing guide for ""High Noon"" and use the film with high school students of varying abilities.  It remains a fantastic film, one of the very best films (all genres) of all time, as well as a fantastic tool for teaching the ""elements of literature.""
I recently purchased the DVD which contains a short documentary, ""The Making of High Noon,"" hosted by Leonard Matlin.  The documentary is an important source of information about the film, especially the comments by the film's director Fred Zimmerman.  Matlin provides some excellent material on the film's relationship to the antics of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.  Most of this information is available in film history reference books, but its nice to find it on the DVD.
I can't think of a better method of teaching the essence of ""civic responsibility"" then using this marvelous film.
I should add that I'm a fan of ""B"" westerns, so it's not surprising that I'm raving about ""High Noon.""

Fred Zinnemann's tense direction makes the audience feel every ticking second!  Gary Cooper usually sucks, but I identified with his crisis in this film.  What would you do if asked to be a deputy and possible casualty for the sake of justice?  I sure wouldn't wear that tin star!  I sure would get shot!",982022400,,489,4.694117647058824
3396014,5,B0016MLIKM,"Gary Cooper portrays Will Kane, a small town marshal who is retiring, getting married, and moving away to do other things.  Just before departing with his new bride (Grace Kelly), he learns that a murderous outlaw he captured five years ago has been pardoned and is coming in on the noon train seeking revenge.  Three of the outlaw's men are already waiting for their leader at the station.
Initially, Kane takes the townspeople's advice and hurriedly leaves with his wife.  But he soon determines that he must go back and face the villain.  First, he believes he and his wife stand a better chance in town than alone on the prairie against four assailants.  Second, even if he weren't immediately caught, he could be found and killed at any time in the future.  Third, his replacement isn't expected until the next day, so the town is without law enforcement.  Things could get so out-of-hand that the town would again become unsafe for decent people to raise their families, as it was before he became marshal.  Though Kane's decision entails great personal risk, he strongly believes that it is the right thing to do.
Back in town, Kane sets about the formidable task of trying to form a posse, with less than an hour until noon.  But support is not forthcoming.  Concerned for themselves and their families, people are less than eager to join with him in what looks like a suicide mission.  The credulity of the characters' reasoning and reactions as noon draws near is eminently believable, and is a big part of what makes this movie so great.  With each passing minute, Kane's untimely demise seems more certain.
This is a powerful movie about integrity and courage in the face of adversity; about strength of character and putting the common good before self.  These virtues are exemplified amidst a spectrum of other human responses.  Neither the age of the movie nor the fact that it was filmed in black & white detract from its excellence.  Tex Ritter's music accompanies Kane to great effect.  Superbly acted, suspenseful, and thought-provoking, this is a timeless classic.",980035200,,2084,4.844632768361582
3396015,5,B0016MLIKM,"This movie isn't really a true 'western' because a true western uses the west as a backdrop....making it a crucial part of the film.  Well, this movie really isn't about the backdrops...it's about Gary Cooper standing up by himself to do the right thing (fighting off the bad guys), even if he has no one else on his side fighting with him.  So, this movie is more of a morality themed film rather than a western.  This movie is so successful because, it's short, and it gets to the point, and it has a very good story.  If you think about why Hollywood would come out with a film that has a moral about ""doing the right thing, even if you must fight alone"" it's because at the time 'High Noon' came out (1953) , the U.S. was fighting the in Cold War..against the U.S.S.R...and it seemed the U.S. was the only country standing up to the Commies, like Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" standing up against the 4 bad guys.  My dad told me that, and it makes perfect sense to me, so I thought I'd put it in this review.  This is a great movie...even for people who aren't fans of westerns (like me) watch it!

3396016,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"" is frequently mentioned among the best Westerns and even among the best films ever made.  It is rated #33 by the American Film Institute on their top 100 of the 20th century.  It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including best actor for Gary Cooper, best song and best editing.  But, was it really that good?  After all, it was a bare bones black and white Western in an age of Technicolor spectaculars.
It was that good and more.  ""High Noon"" was not really a Western as the genre had been defined to that point.  It was more of a character study of the human condition.  It just happened to be set in the American West.  Westerns at that time were action films with white hats and black hats.  There were fistfights and gunfights throughout the entire film.  They clearly differentiated good guys, on the side of justice and righteousness, from bad guys who spurned laws and sneered at those who obeyed them.  The heroes were always noble and fearless, typified by actors like John Wayne and Roy Rogers.  Moreover, the good guys always stuck together, despite all odds, to prevail against the outlaws.
""High Noon"" was the complete antithesis of this formula.  Kane is a flawed hero who is proud to a fault.  Although it is clear who the villain is, we never see him until the last ten minutes of the film.  The story is not about good and evil in the larger sense.  Instead, it is about conviction and integrity on a personal level.  Kane is portrayed as stubbornly putting his own feelings above the safety of the town.  He stands against everyone, willing to sacrifice his marriage, his friendships, his good name and his life for his honor and self-respect.  The biggest departure from the formula was his unabashed manifestations of fear.  This was unheard of for a Western hero.
Controversy swirled around this film, released in 1952 amid the Red Scare and the McCarthy Era.  The fearful and selfish townspeople who turned their backs on Kane were seen to be allegorical of the movie industry that abandoned those who were blacklisted as communists.  Many in the industry saw it as smug slap in the face.  John Wayne called the film ""un-American"", preferring to think that Americans would always stick together to fight injustice, ignoring the reality of numerous branded actors who couldn't get work.  Stanley Kramer, in an interview forty years later, continued to deny that there was any hidden agenda.  He said it was a film about human nature, and the coincidental fact that there was such a striking parallel was just an indication that human nature doesn't change.
The vanguard direction by Fred Zinnemann was nothing short of brilliant.  Zinnemann eschewed the Western formula and struck out in a completely different direction.  He chose black and white to give it a stark look.  The sky was overcast rather than sunny and blue.  The entire film was shot for only $700,000 (an extremely small sum even for 1952) almost completely on a studio lot.  This was the first Western, (and possibly the first film) to tell a story in real time (the story transpires in roughly the same amount of time as the length of the film).  The villainous Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald) was known only through dialogue and he did not actually appear until the end of the film.  Zinnemann hung the pall of Miller ominously in the air like an evil spirit who was feared but unseen.  This made the villain bigger than life and added to the suspense.  Even when Miller finally arrived on the noon train, Zinnemann didn't let us see his face for a full two or three minutes, showing him strapping on his guns from behind and talking to his gang.  Finally, there was no action until the very end of the film.
He uses two very effective techniques to build suspense.  The first is the use of clocks.  In the beginning of the film, they were small clocks in the background that had short pendulums that swung quickly.  As we got closer to noon, the clocks got bigger and the pendulums swung more slowly making them more menacing.  At noon, the clock took up the entire screen as we waited for the last tick and the train's whistle.
The second technique was the repeated use of a static vista looking down the railroad tracks from ground level with no train.  This was a constant reminder that Frank was coming.  This created an extraordinary amount of tension.  Tinnemann's use of reaction shots and the editing by Harry Gerstad and Elmo Williams (who won an Oscar) were also brilliantly done.
The use of music was also innovative.  Rather than a full orchestra pumping out heart pounding adventure music, we had a simple ballad featuring a harmonica and the voice of country great Tex Ritter.  This haunting tune emphasized the loneliness of Kane's situation.
The acting was marvelous.  Gary Cooper is masterful as the tormented Marshall who stands against the entire town and his own fear to face down the Miller gang.  This film launched Grace Kelly's career.  She was not only shockingly beautiful but gave a fantastic performance as Kane's wife, who all but abandons him.  Lloyd Bridges also shines as the hotheaded deputy.  Other notables included Lon Chaney, Harry Morgan, Katy Jurado and Lee Van Cleef.
This film redefined an entire genre.  It has been called the quintessential Western, but that is too narrow in its praise.  It is quintessential filmmaking, a perfect 10.  It is required viewing for film buffs who appreciate the creative aspect of the art.  Besides that, it's great entertainment.",973382400,,5526,4.756046267087276
3396017,4,B0016MLIKM,"By the time the strong, soft-spoken ""High Noon"" was released in 1952, Westerns had become increasingly thoughtful. Facing the villain may have been a necessity, but it was done with doubts or drawbacks, even recriminations. In ""High Noon"" the respected marshal of a small, isolated town must face the return of a convict being released from the prison term to which the marshal had sent him. The marshal has just married a Quaker woman and is retiring from his post to run a store in a distant town. Knowing that the ex-con's primary objective in coming to town is to kill the marshal, the population (including venerable character actors Thomas Mitchell, Otto Kruger, Lon Chaney, Jr.) would just as soon the marshal leave as quickly as possible and let nature take its course. (I THINK the idea is the ex-con and his henchmen will ride into town, ...,  maybe rob the bank, then be on their way.) The marshal, however, feels morally compelled to stand his ground against the threat, asking only for a little support. Slowly, the whole town turns against him. Carl Foreman's tight screenplay sets up the situation expertly, and the fine craftsman Fred Zinneman was chosen to direct. The picture opens on the plains outside town, and the first close-up belongs to Lee Van Cleef, which is perfect. He had the meanest eyes in movies: one glance and you knew somebody was in deep trouble. When the story moves into town, there are constant references to time, with a wall clock visible in three opening interiors. Because the story is told in ""real time"", the editing and continuity are crucial, and the editors deservedly won an Oscar, as did Dimitri Tiomkin's theme song, sung by Grand Ole Opry star Tex Ritter. Gary Cooper won his second Oscar playing the marshal. He was obviously old enough to play the heroine's father, not her bridegroom; but I think his maturity heightens the film's sense of impending mortality. The marshal is a man with death on his mind, so there is a minimum of that goofy shyness that was a part of Cooper's romantic shtik. In contrast to the marshal is his deputy, played by a young Lloyd Bridges, whose bland good looks and slightly puzzled expression cause the other characters to dismiss him as immature. And the sultry Katy Jurado is suppose to be his mistress!? She treats him like cookies and milk. Completing the contrast is Katy Jurado's brunette mystery against the pellucid beauty of Grace Kelly. This was Grace Kelly's second picture -- she gets fifth billing. She had made her film debut the year before in a psychological study called ""Fourteen Hours"", which evidently is not available for home viewing. (As I recall, a distraught Richard Basehart is threatening to jump from a high building ledge, unaware of how he is affecting other lives, including that of Grace Kelly's character, a young socialite seeking a divorce at her lawyer's office in a nearby building.) In ""High Noon"", once the ex-con and his gang enter town, the climax is succinct and surprisingly cynical. Suffice it to say, the townspeople finally come out of their hiding places to give support. Without a word, the marshal takes off his tin star and throws it in the dirt. So much for frontier law and order. It's a quiet and powerful ending for a quiet and powerful Western.",971395200,,3286,4.785211267605634

3396019,4,B0016MLIKM,"I was prompted to watch High Noon by Dennis Prager's Nationally syndicated radio program, The Dennis Prager Show.  I must admit, I missed most of his conversation about the film, but I figured if the intelligent Dennis Prager  spent a weekend watching an old western instead of devouring some lofty  tome, there must be something to it.
Indeed there was, and is.  High Noon  is a classic western, with a clear demarcation between good and evil.  What  I found interesting however, was how relevant the issues within this  sampling of the old-fashioned western genre are today.  Quite simply, the  story is about the dilemma societies face when confronted with truly evil  people intent on doing harm to others.  Based on the shootout in the end  (traditional western stuff here) one might think the answers are simple.  But the well-crafted script leads the viewer through the myriad of  perspectives on issues such as capital punishment, duty, courage and honor,  societal apathy and the agonizing personal decision to stand up for what  one thinks is right.  A truly well-done cinematic dissertation on the  issues that spark public debate today.
I recommend the movie not just for  those reasons stated above, but also because its just a plain-old well-done  movie and story.  It defies its age.  A classic for all time.",963964800,,1323,4.967889908256881

The plot had so many details and layers that could  have been explored, but no.  It fails on almost every level.  The only  saving grace is that Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly look good in it. Also, I  appreciated the unself conscious approach to references to an interracial  romance that ended before the beginning of the movie, something quite  remarkable for a movie from the early fifties.  Everything else is just off  the mark.  I still can't believe that Tiomkin's song became so popular.  There are so many holes in this most boring of scripts.  What really  shocked me was the subpar cinematography and production values, especially  for a film that they obviously had spent a lot of money on.  The story  takes the course of a single day, but there were so many continuity  problems in terms of lighting(i.e. 5pm looked like noon and noon looked  like dusk).  Grace Kelly spends the entire film wandering around and  pouting.  Cooper and Lloyd Bridges were absolutely disappointing.  I gave  it two stars only because it was a very influential film and became its own  archetypes for many films to come.  This movie represents all the ills that  come from a film industry that was oppressed by production codes and  McCarthyism.  Don't waste your time.

3396051,5,B0016MLIKM,"HIGH NOON continues to resonate with audiences today, almost 50 years after its 1952 release. That such a dark, bleakly cynical movie should remain so popular is at first thought surprising. Of course, there are  obvious reasons why this is so. It is a terrifically tense story. Has  involving characters, tight script, splendid direction, wonderful editing,  cinematography, soundtrack, and a towering performance from Cooper (and not  due to his suffering with an ulcer while it was filming, as some would have  you believe). But it is reaching new audiences, especially women. Indeed,  it is being taught in many feminist courses in college. And the feminist  approach to Cooper and his dilemma and his reaction to it is very  intriguing. Here's a man who is the king of the town, the toughest man  around, lord of his realm. However, he meets a younger woman, falls in love  and marries her. Then comes word that four men are coming on the noon  train, and very likely are coming with one purpose, to kill him. His wife  wants him to leave and they start out. But he stops and says he can't  leave: ""They're making me run and I've never run from anyone  before."" Back they go to town. Everytime he is asked why he isn't  leaving, his only response is: ""I don't know."" The feminist take  on this makes perfect sense: Here's the lord of his realm newly married,  and his wife has him quitting his job, leaving his town, his friends, and  moving to a town of her choice, where he will open a store (her choice) and  help her run it (her choice). He is no longer his man, he is her man. By  staying and facing his would-be killers, this man is rebelling, making a  last-ditch stand to preserve his ""masculinity"", to show himself  and others -- and his wife! -- that he is still in control. This adds a  rich new dimension to every situation and character conflict throughout the  film. Watch it from this perspective and you'll see an entirely new film.  Entirely new and still one of the grand all-time classics. Interesting  sidebar: During the filming, Cooper became friendly with writer Carl  Foreman. They agreed to form a company, Cooper would star, Foreman write,  Stanley Kramer produce. But John Wayne, Ward Bond and others wanted Foreman  blacklisted. They put pressure on Cooper and director Fred Zinneman to  quit, or their careers would be ruined. Cooper and Zinneman refused,  sticking by Foreman. When liberal Kramer caved in, Cooper threatened to  walk, which meant there'd be no film, since it was an independent  production, and a Salinas lettuce grower had invested only if Cooper would  star. Eventually, Wayne and the others got their way and Foreman was  blacklisted. Kramer backed out of the company. Cooper offered to go public  with Foreman about the company, even offered to go to Washington to testify  on Foreman's behalf before the House Un-American Activities Committee (this  from a man who was a deservedly awkward and embarrassed friendly witness in  1947, even though he named no names and said he wanted no-one hurt). But  Foreman finally threw in the towel, was blacklisted, and moved to London.  But ever after, he always said that Cooper was the only ""big one""  who stood by him. He also sent to Cooper for first consideration all of his  scripts after this, including: BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, THE KEY and GUNS  OF NAVARONE. John Wayne's despicable role in the Hollywood blacklist is  something which is rarely talked about. Wonder why?",952992000,,3476,4.78752107925801

3396063,1,B0016MLIKM,"High Noon, the greatest Western of all times?  Please?  The plot is ludicrous.  An entire town quivering behind closed doors in the Old West.  Hardly.  Every family in that era had a rifle, shotgun, and pistols and  were more than willing to use them. Remember Coffeyville, Kansas, and the  Dalton Brothers--now those Dalton boys were a true criminal crew.  Unlike  these pansy-thugs who arrive in town to murder Cooper and who fail  miserably in their attempt.  In the Old West these props-for-criminals  would have been shot down (bushwacked) in quick order by the good citizens.  America then, and the Old West, had plenty of guns and were willing to use  them. In this film, the town should have turned their armaments on Cooper  (who acted as if he were already dead), Tex Ritter who sounded as if he  were dying during his hideous singing, and the  casting director who  selected Cooper, worn out and depleted, as the geezer who would plunder the  breathtaking Grace Kelly (no wonder she left the country), and any of the  other cast who participated in this ordeal.",951004800,,1072,4.785714285714286
3396064,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is one of the all time classic of it's day or any day.  Gary cooper, often said to be stiff or wooden in his acting is wonderful here.  His stiffness can surely be attributed to the unending suspense of the  situation.  A new wife and yet death may strike at any moment.  The tension  rivals Alfred Hitchcock's productions. If for no other reason this movie is  worth the time just for the wonderful Grace Kelly.",948931200,,417,4.407894736842105
3396065,5,B0016MLIKM,"This is a big western classic but you'll love this film even though you don't enjoy westerns. The nature of the film is to analyze human behavior and characteristics. I think ""Cat on a hot tin roof"" (Elizabeth  Taylor, Paul Newman) can be good shot to compare. They are absolutely the  same styles, but only the athmosphere is different. There is no classical  western action with exited cowboys and indians. Also the special features  has  very satisfactory interviews and nice narration. Quite a good shot for  classical collectors.",947635200,,534,5.011363636363637
3396066,5,B0016MLIKM,"I am not a westerns fan or a fan of black and white films, but as an assignment for a Liberal Arts course I needed to watch this film and compare it to Individualism.
As I was watching this film... I got so  engrossed in the whole thing that I had not jotted down one single note!  I  had forgotten about the piece of paper!
My heart actually stopped when  the clock hit HIGH NOON!",941500800,,381,4.04
3396067,5,B0016MLIKM,"""High Noon"", along with ""Shane"", can arguably be called the best westerns ever made.  Both are that rare breed of film that never seems to age or get stale.  As stated by everyone, ""High Noon"" plays out in almost real time,  as a newly retired lawman (Gary Cooper) watches the clock and waits for a  train that carries 3 men who have sworn to kill him.  During his wait, he  seeks out the townspeople for help, only to be turned down one by one.  ""High Noon"" has always remained one of my favorite westerns, and after  seeing this film, the tune `Do Not Forsake Me' runs in my head for weeks.  Between 1 and 10, this classic gets a 10.",925948800,,635,4.225
