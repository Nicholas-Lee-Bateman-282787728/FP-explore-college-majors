8355608,4,B00283QEJS,"I thought this was a good description of a real outlaw and his close knit family.  It was entertaining, it depicted good against evil.  It also showed that a person's past can have direct bearing on his future.  Some have said it stole its plot from High Noon, however I didn't have that impression.

It was obviously a low budget film and could have used more people in the back ground to make seem like a real town.

With this said, I enjoyed the film and that is the goal of the producers or should be.

As usual, Amazon is a good place to find otherwise little known films.",1304467200,,577,4.247706422018348
8355609,1,B00283QEJS,"....if you do not either purchase or watch this film. I dare you to last more than ten minutes without getting angry at everyone involved in this film (and possibly yourself for wasting ten precious minutes of your life) if you do. This amateur college production is so terrible and full of problems that there is not enough space nor time to go into them here. All I can say is, if this was a project that was graded, it should have been an A for effort, an F for execution and the negative ceremonially burned. Oh yes, one more thing, it does not fall into the category of ""so bad, it's good"" rather, it falls into the ""so bad it sucks"" category. If you still insist on seeing this garbage, remember you were forewarned!",1261353600,4,722,4.355555555555555

8355611,1,B00283QEJS,"This movie does not come anywhere near to living up to its hype. The plot is basically drawn from the 1952 High Noon. This theme is accentuated by the DVD jacket which shows a train arriving , along with outriders in a scene reminiscent of an early Pancho Villa movie. The only problem is that nowhere in the movie does a train appear. In addition, the DVD jacket shows a cowboy (the protagonist?) wearing a long duster a la Wild Bunch or High Plains Drifter- again, nowhere in the actual movie is this item worn. The Wild Bunch theme carries on into the opening sequence of the movie, although the actors' costumes and hairstyles appear to have been drawn from High Noon (or Knight Rider in the case of the villain). The head shots in the movie seem to have been drawn from High Plains Drifter. To continue the Western movie tour there is also a scene ( opping blood) strikingly similar to one from the Deadwood series and a prisoner-hostage exchange that seems to be drawn from Rio Lobo. The conclusion of the movie is an amazing gunfight in which about a dozen people are shooting at eight or so bad guys in close quarters and the only ones shot are all the bad guys except one who is left for the sheriff to dispatch - and that scene seems to be a blend of various scenes from the Quick and the Dead ( the Sharon Stone/Russell Crowe version).

The only original part of the movie- and that may be because I haven't found the source ye - are the two shell shocked confederate vets/village idiots (vaguely reminiscent of Gabby Hayes). The sets seem suitably spartan and so may be representative of the period, or possibly a low budget. The lighting is quite poor at times, whether this is intentional or not I can't tell.

To sum up, the movie appears to be an unoriginal collage of scenes from a bunch of classic westerns. While it may become a cult movie, to me it was only a major disappointment.",1249430400,2,1901,4.428571428571429
8355612,1,B00283QEJS,"This is not only the worst western, but the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot believe Lions Gate, and Amazon, are charging loyal customers full price for this travesty. According to the credits it is a Community College film production. It is packaged and spun as being a legitimate movie, when it certainly is not. I cannot believe this was even Mass Produced. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, you will feel duped and cheated.",1249084800,10,422,4.565789473684211
8355613,1,B00283QEJS,"Was this suppose to be a spoof on the western genre? From the grass growing in the middle of main street, to the cell phone falling out of Peter Sharaykos robe pocket, this amateur-like, low budget film lacked any attributes associated with a western drama. While the costuming is the redeeming factor and well done (except for the pointy toe rodeo boots), the dramatic gunfight scenes look and sound like a bunch of little boys with caps guns. The armourer should consider black powder loads and period leather in his next endeavor. The continuity between scenes is laughable, the scoring is shameful. No recommedation here.",1248393600,,625,4.961904761904762
