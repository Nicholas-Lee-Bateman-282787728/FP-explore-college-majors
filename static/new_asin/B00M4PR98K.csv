6561634,5,B00M4PR98K,Sledge is a movie that is fun and enjoyable. Yes it is cheesy but overall the humor is great and the blood is a lot of fun. Definitely worth checking out.,1409875200,,154,4.0
6561635,4,B00M4PR98K,"I started watching Sledge fully intending to enjoy it for what it is, a classic B horror film. And it didn't disappoint!  I did not expect to be completely taken in by the sub plots. There are real relationships that uncover slowly without a ton of exposition. The actors were excellent and had me submersed in the story so much that it felt like I was in those woods. If, like me, you are a fan of the genre and enjoy seeing the perspective of new film makers, then you need to get Sledge!",1409875200,,490,4.212765957446808

6561651,1,B00M4PR98K,"Terrible film on all levels. I will say, the character Alex (Dustin Bowman) is the biggest d-bag in the history of c-movie micro-budget horror. That he irritated me to that level does require that I give proper credit to the screenwriter and the actor. I know this video production company has a solid following, but this was truly perfect for Amazon Prime, as at least I didn't waste a penny - just lost 90 minutes of my life (I have kind of a rule about watching even the worst films all the way through if I going to review them).

The only saving grace of this video is the actress on the couch (Rachel Cornell), and only because she's ""what is she doing in this atrocious video"" attractive. No, this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously - it's clearly a half-hearted parody intended to have some fun with (note the dialog overlaps, the fake leg that ""Sledge"" is chewing on in one scene)... it's more of an experimental weekend shoot by a team of filmmaking friends and nothing more. Probably fun for the 420 crowd.

BLUF: No scares (at all), no suspense, lame acting, poor camerawork, laughably bad special effects, and, again, Alex - the character you will actually spend 90 minutes of your life waiting to watch get his head caved in by Sledge.",1420156800,2,1254,4.54424778761062

6561653,2,B00M4PR98K,I stayed with it as long as I could without putting a gun in my mouth.

6561657,2,B00M4PR98K,"The fine folks at Brain Damage Films have been responsible for several films I have thoroughly enjoyed this year.  These include SCAVENGER KILLERS, DEAD ON APPRAISAL, and POE.  However, even the best companies have a miss every now and then.  It saddens me to report their recent release SLEDGE is one of those misses.  Although the film has a great premise, the final product comes up way short in the entertainment category.

Unfortunately, this film made me scream for it to stop.  For as much as I love the concept of a killer with a sledgehammer, the execution here leaves much to be desired.  And yes, I realize the film was meant to be tongue-in-cheek to begin withbut even that aspect never makes it across for me.

SLEDGE is shot in a low-budget fashion, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it is painfully obvious here.  The sound quality is terrible which, while not a complete fun-killer by itself, is just one more nail in the coffin here. These two negatives are not usually a reason to dislike a film completely, but when they are combined with poor acting and sad special effects, theres really not much that can save it.

Speaking of poor acting, the quality within this film is below poverty-level.  Regardless of whether or not this was done intentionally, the pitiful cast does nothing for me at all.  I found each character annoying, and this was compounded exponentially by the fact that none of the cast could act.  I would daresay Ive seen elementary school productions with more talent.

I would like to say the special effects in SLEDGE are decent, however they are simply dull and flat.  The blood and gore look orange instead of crimson, which is almost laughableif it weren't for the fact the special effects team tries hard to make it look real.  The intestine that was supposedly ripped from a guys stomach is just a single rubber hose painted red.  I actually shook my head when this scene arrived.  If it was meant to be funny, it failed.

I hate to rip a film like this when it could have been so good, however it is my duty as a reviewer to give you my honest assessment.  As a result, I have to recommend you steer clear of SLEDGE, unless you have an hour and a half of your life that you don't want back.  The film is available now if you decide to give it a look.",1414108800,5,2317,4.4952153110047846
6561658,4,B00M4PR98K,"When you consider the whole ""package"" * (i.e. a pretty decent horror-comedy made for $800!!), it's a very good film overall! From a horror standpoint, no, it isn't 'Alien'......but you will laugh, I promise!! The funny parts really are funny!",1413936000,,242,5.075
6561659,4,B00M4PR98K,"Well I must say that I consider myself a huge horror fan. I will admit that I am not hard to please as I am an avid supporter of low budget horror. Most of them are better in many ways than most of the bigger budget mainstream horror films. Sledge made me more than happy as a film watcher. Am I saying that this movie is perfect and on scale with the classics? No. Am I saying that this movie is worth your time and a little of your money? Yes. Now I am going to be totally honest and say you can see that this did not have the budget that major films do, but let me ask you this, could you make a better looking or sounding movie yourself on the budget they had? I would venture to say no, even though I know most of you are thinking of course I could. Until you make a low budget feature you have no idea how much work it takes. I have made one also, and it was not easy.
The story is very classic, group of people go to an area that is secluded and bad things happen to them. I am not going to go into detail on what happens, you should spend a few bucks and rent it at the very least if you really want to know. The biggest thing about this movie is Adam Lynch. He doesn't take himself or his victims seriously, and that is what really makes him a memorable killler. I look forward to seeing a sequel and hearing Adam really make me laugh at him killing stupid people. You should check this movie out if nothing else to meet a new killer you will love.",1411430400,,1457,3.942372881355932
6561660,4,B00M4PR98K,"Sledge is a shoestring budget Slasher/Basher flick by Kristian Hanson. It has all the makings of a cult classic.
It's one of those ""its so bad its good"" kind if movies but the beauty of it is that is exactly what it wants to be. I wouldn't call it camp because camp is unintentionally bad.

Sledge owns every slice of cheese it serves up. The dialogue is hilarious in that its exactly what a bunch of drunk horny Twenty somethings would really say,it didn't even seem scripted but I'm assuming it was.it pays homage to many classic slasher flicks but the story although somewhat formulaic seems fresh.

The gore effects are over the top and not very impressive but it all works in the films favor. The sledgehammer welding Adam Lynch has some of the est one liners from a maniac since Freddie Krueger.",1410825600,,801,4.555555555555555
6561661,4,B00M4PR98K,This movie is just good fun! It is packed full of humor and adds some originality to your standard horror bad guy (finally!).

This IS for people that truly appreciate horror films and want to sit back and enjoy a movie that's loaded with morbid humor, hilarious one liners, and references to past horror movies that any horror fan will appreciate. The Director/Writer Kristian Hanson is a huge fan of horror and knows how to bring a unique twist to the horror movie genre and it shows.

6561665,5,B00M4PR98K,"Before I begin the review proper know what you're getting into before you begin to watch ""Sledge"". This is a horror/comedy that makes up for its technical shortcomings with sheer fun and great execution. As long as you don't enter this thinking you're getting an A-list, cookie cutter, PG Hollywood horror movie, or a straight horror film, you're fine. With that out of way, let's jump into the world of Adam Lynch and Sledge as brought to us by Kristian Hanson, John Sovie II and crew!

Now take your typical group going into the woods where a certain wise-cracking killer happens to be toting his weapon of choice, a sledgehammer, and you have the makings for more than a few dead bodies. That's what happens in due course, but not before we get to experience the wonder that is Adam Lynch! Love him or hate him, he always has something to say and isn't afraid to kill you while slipping in a joke or an insult along for good measure! Add to this set-up the fact that ""Sledge"" itself is presented as a movie within a movie. Within this context, we see that tonight's lovely film is brought to us by Assly's Horror Show and is being watched by a young lady who may be getting a bit to drawn into the film itself... These segments have a life of their own and Assly is just as much a smart ass as our resident Sledge-head, Adam Lynch. Oh, did I mention the ""Amish Paradise"" trailer? Well, you'll have to see that for yourself, but I must admit that that is one movie that I wouldn't mind seeing!

Back to the movie itself, we get some good performances and quite a bit more plot and character build-up than I was expecting from a movie of this type and while it is a horror-comedy at heart it does a good job of straying into the pure camp field that can be painful to watch at times. Also whatever technical limitations are easily overlooked when you simply sit back and enjoy the movie. Don't get too comfortable though as there are quite enough kills and laughs to keep you wanting more. That being said this is a great example of what great independent horror can look like and I urge everyone to go out and get this on whatever format you prefer. Better yet, stay at home and let Amazon do all the work for you! I guarantee that if you go into this film wishing to be entertained you will be and you will also be looking forward to seeing more of Adam Lynch in the upcoming sequel! Better yet, you can hope to see him in Sledge II-IX. Sledge IX being the one where Adam Lynch travels to a future where people have forgotten what a sledgehammer is only to be quickly reminded by Mr. Lynch firsthand.... Must watch!",1410048000,,2618,4.362704918032787

6561672,4,B00M4PR98K,"So many people talk about making films but never do them. It is a daunting task beyond the inception. Money, talent, location, all of this can stop a new film maker dead in their tracks. Writer/Director Kristian Hanson was not going to be derailed by any such thing as he attempted to bring his vision to the screen. Well it is here and it is calledSledge!

Sledge is presented as a film within a film. Asslys True American Horror is running tonights film entitled Sledge. Assly is a werewolf puppet that has to be experienced. Just trust me, he is a highlight of the film.  The story of a group of twentysomethings that venture out for a camping trip that leads to terror and bloodso much blood. The campground they choose is the rumored domain of Adam Lynch 9kristian Hanson). Alex (Dustin Bowman) is the loudmouth group clown. More aggressive than funny, he is an alpha male that has clearly lost his way. Sarah (Stephanie Tupper) is Alexs trophy, but she is now hooked up with Nash (Russ Matoes), a little boy in a mans body. Lastly are Shawn (Travis Hanson) and Michelle (Desiree Holmes) the stable couple of the group. They plan a weekend of fun, and for Alex, mischief.  Problem is, Adam Lynch does exist and he is watching.

Sledge is the debut film of writer/director Kristian Hanson. His goal was to create a classic 80s style slasher with humor and gore. The film delivers on its micro budget and provides a simple but fun time for the viewer. There are a lot of laughs but the film still plays it straight. There is no parody here. There is love however. Here is a bit of trivia; Adam Lynch is named after Hatchet and Holliston creators Adam Green and Joe Lynch. An influence on Kristian's writing style.

Sledge is fun film. It's got a sense of the period that influenced it and that's important. Is it for everyone? No. But not everything is. It's a little film with a big bloody heart behind it. Take joy in the little things.",1409875200,,1941,4.502840909090909
6561673,5,B00M4PR98K,"Ok...ok...Sledge is one of them indie films you watch and just love it. Such great homage to old school classic horror films you would see that made it a fun entertaining ride. From the great one-liners to the great kills Sledge is a movie that is a must watch for anyone that is a fan of the old school 80's horror films. ""All hail Adam Lynch!!!"" We need a part 2/3/4/5 etc...",1409875200,,377,4.25
6561674,4,B00M4PR98K,"SLEDGE is the passion project of writer and co-director Kristian Hanson, (along with John Sovie II). Hanson is a huge fan of the 80s-style slasher flick and he captures this tone perfectly in his debut film. What starts out as a seemingly typical romp with teens going into the woods and teens getting killed in said woods becomes something much more in the very capable hands of Hanson and crew. Ill admit that I was hesitant as I sat down to watch SLEDGE (seemed to be just another teens killed in the woods flick) but was more than pleasantly surprised. Hanson puts his own spin on things and doesnt just attempt to make another run-of-the-mill horror-comedy or homage to the 80s-style slasher flick. He does indeed pay homage to the golden era of slasher films but he also makes SLEDGE his own. This is a hugely fun and entertaining horror film.

SLEDGE begins with a fun pre-credit sequence that sets the tone for the entire film. After the mayhem of the opening we then switch to a cutie settling in with some popcorn and wine to watch a movie on TV. At first I didn't know what was going on, but it soon becomes apparent that Hanson is presenting SLEDGE as a film within a film. The host of the late night show is the beloved, foul-mouthed puppet, Assly. If you guessed that the B-movie Assly is presenting is SLEDGE, well you don't win anything. I thought that was pretty obvious. But as it begins we get the typical set up of a bunch of friends gathering together for a fun weekend excursion of drugs, drink, and donut dunking in the woods. But as usual, these teens didn't do their local folklore homework and end up in the wrong part of the woods. Around the campfire, Alex (Dustin Bowman), tells them all about the local urban legend of Adam Lynch (a name taken from two of Hansons horror influences, Adam Green and Joe Lynch). As the story goes, Adam Lynch is a psychotic killer who lives in the woods and kills any and every one he comes across with his trusty sledgehammer. So I guess this isn't really a slasher film so much as a smasher film (yes; Im proud of that one).

It doesnt take long for it to hit the fan but when it does hold onto your hats. SLEDGE is fast-paced, gory, fun, bloody, and gory. Did I mention gory? I read that the budget here was roughly around $2,000. Youd never know it, though. Sure SLEDGE has that low-budget, indie horror look to it, but it doesnt feel cheap. Hanson got every single penny up on the screen and it shows. I was also impressed with the assembled cast. For a low-budget flick, the cast does a really nice job. And the gore  the gore is terrific!! Theres no CGI here, just practical effects ... really fantastic practical effects. I also really love the killers mask. Very creepy and effective. Gore hounds will be pleased because every chance Adam Lynch gets to smash skulls, pull out intestines, and just generally ruin the days of the cast members, he takes  and we the viewer get to see it all. Nothing is done off screen!!  Bravo, Kristian, bravo. Its nice to see that there are still some indie horror filmmakers out there on a shoestring budget that can still deliver the gore.

But I think where SLEDGE really differs from other films in this genre is with the killer himself, Adam Lynch. Lynch isn't a killer because he has mommy issues. Hes not a killer because hes out for revenge. Lynch is killing because hes crazy.  Period. Do you really need a deeper reason than that? So many times writers get caught up in the details that they forget Ockhams Razor:  Less is more. Hanson doesnt forget and he even embraces it. Lynch is just a crazy dude who enjoys smashing and killing people. But theres another difference between Lynch and the traditional slasher. Lynch talks!! Not only does he talk when hes killing victims, but he taunts and belittles them. At first I was completely caught off guard when I heard Lynch talk. But he doesnt just spout out stupid Krueger-esque one-liners that make you roll your eyes and wish hed shut up. Lynch is pretty funny and he provides some much needed comic relief. Best yet is that the horror and comedy elements actually work together and nicely enhance each other.

My only complaints about SLEDGE were that we didn't really get any character development and the dialogue in some places was a little flat. Neither of these complaints hurt my overall opinion of SLEDGE, though. SLEDGE is a fun, back-to-basics slasher (I mean smasher) film that fans of the genre are gonna love. I cant wait to see what Hanson comes up with next and I hope SLEDGE isn't the last time we meet Adam Lynch. I think hes still got a lot of killing left in him. Dont miss SLEDGE.",1409875200,,4665,4.504728132387707
6561675,5,B00M4PR98K,"Very enjoyable movie as long as you in now what you're getting into. Its horror with morbid humor, online with the writer of the film. Yes the humor is cheesy but it involves one-liner references to other movies of the horror genre. The movie is more lively than most horror films that focus on selling through sex. By playing on humor, you're able to enjoy the movie instead of the feint of heart turning away when the ""scary music"" starts playing to give away the scene.

Then, not five minutes into the movie, he unconvincingly kills some annoying people WHILE CRACKING LAME ONE LINERS!!! This is actually a jumbled mess that thinks it might be a horror comedy. There is no evidence here that the ""filmmakers"" have the slightest respect for horror and it's fans, and they seem to simply be filming some cronies who are pretending to make a movie, it's that bad. The goal seems to have been to get something, anything on video so it could be hawked to the gullible, and the results do not even have camp enjoyment value. A total disaster!",1458950400,,851,4.68

8670321,1,B00M4PR98K,"Sledge had some potential, with a generic but serviceable plot and a promise to pay homage to the stylings of classic slasher films (Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are obvious influences). That potential is never realized. From the first few minutes of the film it's obvious that this is a no-budget passion project staffed and cast almost entirely by friends and family of the filmmakers, and the lack of experience is evident at every level. The camerawork is extremely messy, with poorly framed, static shots that go one for minutes at a time and a seeming inability to properly focus. The acting emphasizes every failing of the awful script, and the film's villain (played by writer and co-director Kristian Hanson) is a groan-inducing attempt at a Freddy Krueger archetype whose one-liners make for painfully bad cinema. Even the gore effects, which have been spoken of positively by some reviews, consisted almost entirely of people throwing blood onto things (the killer, a tree, the ground) from just off camera.

Even devoted fans of the genre should avoid this one. It fails to even begin to approach the films it emulates, but it's more than just that. Sledge feels less like an amateur horror movie than a failing-grade film school project. And it has none of the historical significance or accidental entertainment value of some ""classics"" of the slasher genre that live on in bad movie infamy.",1440374400,,1422,4.949790794979079
8670322,1,B00M4PR98K,"I wanna know what their budget was. If it was anything north of 10 bucks, I'd have to say someone got ripped off. I enjoy a poorly made indie film like anyone else, but there had better be a story and somewhat believable acting but my god this was just awful. The actors had one too many awkward interactions where either they forgot a line and went with it, or simply didn't have anything to do with their hands, and the lazy editors just went with it. Just Awful... How it got to a 3 star average is beyond me.",1434931200,,512,4.13
8670323,1,B00M4PR98K,"I wish I could give this a minus 100 stars! A sick film by sick people for sick people. If you like to see people's heads bashed in, imbeciles framed for murders they didn't commit, and unending extreme violence, then you have found your nirvana in this piece of trash. If you have any self respect or a modicum of human dignity, you'll take my warning and stay away from this excrement being passed off as a film. Amazon should not give HD space to crap like this. Their subscribers deserve better consideration. Aren't there enough porn sites to keep scumbags happy? Amazon, please delete this!",1433116800,,596,4.632075471698113
8670324,3,B00M4PR98K,"The story is one that is sort of cookie cutter in most slasher films, but it is a pattern to the genre that works. The actual story is framed by a more modern story of a young girl watching ""Sledge"" on a late night horror show called 'Assly's True American Horror'. This almost gives a blend of horror host/anthology vibe to the viewing experience. It is a unique aspect that created that comfortable air going into the story. Now the killer on the other hand, although I dug the design, was a bit uncomfortable to watch on screen. For me personally , the over-the- top jokey quality took away from the power that ""Sledge"" was generating for me. It was really the only hang up I had in this entire film. The cast gave great performances, made the characters believable and added authenticity to the story arch, instead of seeming like actors put into a situation they can't relate.

The special effects are on the cheaper side, most indie slashers do and ""get it done"". ""Sledge"" is no exception, the film gives good gore. The kills fun, bloody and classic. The intro effects at the beginning had me worried with the obvious CGI blood, but the energy and feel of the kill sequences and use of practical effects made everything all better for me as a horror, and slasher, fan. The atmosphere stays very casual while being very dark which really shines during the dialog/drama scenes of the cast. Reminiscent of early 80's indie slashers, the comic relief of the killer interactions give hit and miss moments that sometimes complements the film and other times holds it back.",1432080000,,1572,4.654676258992806
8670325,2,B00M4PR98K,"Not very well made. Few performers with any acting ability. If not for the fact that it kept me wanting to see just how silly it would get, I probably wouldn't have finished it and would have given it one star (or none).",1431907200,,220,4.1395348837209305
8670326,2,B00M4PR98K,Thought the movie looked cool based on the cover art but it was painful to get through. It's very apparent that most of the lines are ad-libbbed which can be frustrating to listen to as the actors talk over one another all the time. These dialogue scenes go on WAY too long as well.  The characters are not likeable at all and I couldn't stand to listen to main hero guy talk. Nothing but cocky prick lines that just got so old. The wraparound sucked too because who watches a movie and talks out loud to themselves about everything they are thinking? The killer is barely in it and has a really annoying voice as well. Mask looks kinda cool though. These are my opinions. Judge for yourself.,1430697600,,692,4.40625
