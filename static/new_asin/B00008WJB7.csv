7987642,4,B00008WJB7,"This DVD is performed largely by students. It includes lots of information about imigration and American history. Some of the music is quite good, some is not quite so professional sounding, but it's all touching. The videography is very good. I would recommend this DVD for teachers.",1172102400,,284,5.0638297872340425
7987643,1,B00008WJB7,"This is a video that celebrates America's multiculturalism.  There are many scenes of dancing and singing children, many in thier native costumes from their native lands, but very little in the way of America's classic patriotic songs.  The advertising is a little misleading.  If you are looking for a video with rousing American patriotic songs, you will be disappointed.",1099440000,6,373,5.288135593220339
