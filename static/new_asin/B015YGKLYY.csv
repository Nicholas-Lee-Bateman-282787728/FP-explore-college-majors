8735105,1,B015YGKLYY,Gifted the DVD at Christmas and it was totally blank. It was 6 months later that the person I gifted it to told me. I'm in the IT field and being that I thought they were insane I put it into a computer to look for data on the disk and sure enough there was none.,1529280000,,263,3.7142857142857144
8735106,5,B015YGKLYY,"This film outlines the mysterious disappearance of a scion of a billionaire family near an island inhabited by warring cannibalistic tribes. His disappearance triggered a worldwide search around Papua New Guinea and yet was unable to recover a body or conclusion as to what happened to Mr. Rockefeller. The story itself is captivating, but the archival footage (shot in a sort of sepia tone filter) illicits a creepy campfire vibe as the camera moves over spear wielding tribesmen adorned with necklaces made of human skulls. Definitely worth watching and leaves the viewer wondering what really did happen to this lost man?",1490745600,,624,5.188118811881188
8735107,2,B015YGKLYY,the video is unfinished.  I read a lot about Michael Rockefeller and the way the book ended is incorrect!,1481587200,,105,4.526315789473684
8735108,5,B015YGKLYY,Great documentary.  Read Tobias Schneebaum's books.  Very enlightening.,1471824000,,71,7.75
8735109,3,B015YGKLYY,"I'm old enough to remember when it happened and I was hoping there would be new information with this documentary and there was but it wasn't enough to add much other than to open up a few more theories. Granted the old films are interesting but the recap of what happened leading up to MR taking a swim for shore and disappearing would probably be of greater interest to younger people so keep that in mind if you're younger and bump it up a star.

The second half pretty much goes into several guesses on what happen after MR disappears based on several different reports from a variety of sources. You still have to decide at the end.

The producers and staff did spend a lot of time organizing this so kudos to them. For me it was 3.5 stars. I think it's worth a look and some people who really like this genre should like it more than I.",1465689600,,842,4.25625
8735110,4,B015YGKLYY,"The scion of a wealthy and politically prominent family disappears at the age of 23 in New Guinea after attempting to swim ashore following the overturning of his catamaran.  His travel mate stays put and is rescued the next day whereas Michael Rockefeller is never heard from again.  Michael Rockefeller was declared legally dead in 1964, but it makes sense that without a body rumors would take the place of facts.  The possible outcomes seem to center around the youngest son of Nelson Rockefeller either drowning, being killed by natives or being captured and in some way assimilated into the tribe.

After receiving a tip from a shadowy figure, the late journalist Milt Machlin spent several months in 1969 in New Guinea and its environs researching the possibility that Rockefeller had been taken captive.  The end result of Machlin's investigation was a book called ""The Search for Michael Rockefeller.""  The maker of this documentary, Fraser C. Heston, discovered a lot of 16 mm footage from Machlin's trip after the journalist died and decided to make a documentary that shared the same title as the book.

This documentary is called ""The Search for Michael Rockefeller"" not ""What Really Became of Michael Rockefeller"" so those looking for a definitive answer are going to be disappointed.  In addition to the color footage, I personally find this to be the primary strength of the film.  The documentary provides needed background while not pushing a point of view with respect to the ultimate fate of Mr. Rockefeller.  Lurid speculation is avoided although a potentially grisly demise is not completely discounted.  The discovered 16 mm footage includes interviews with various Dutch missionaries and one criticism I have is that not all of the interviews are automatically subtitled.  Whether it is the quality of the audio and/or the accents, the Dutch interviewees are sometimes hard to hear.

If, like me, you are looking for a quick and interesting way to learn about this sad story, this film is a good choice.  The conclusion of the film offers some overlooked grainy footage of what appears to be a Caucasian or light-skinned man in and among an indigenous war party that was filmed intercepting visitors to their territory.  While it's possible that this could be Michael Rockefeller the narrator of the film rightly points out that the odds are remote.  I tend to approach mysteries such as this with Occam's razor.  For what it's worth, without more concrete and substantiated evidence, chances are that Michael Rockefeller drowned before reaching shore.",1459296000,,2576,5.080760095011876
8735111,5,B015YGKLYY,"Though this film was produced in 2010, it seems to be just making its DVD release.  It is based on the 2001 book by Argosy Magazine writer Milt Machlin, who traveled to New Guinea on a tip that was given to him by a mysterious man from Australia who said he had spotted the wealthy son of Nelson Rockefeller years after the young anthropologist, world traveler and primitive art collect disappeared in 1969. (The Rockefeller family considered him dead  probably drowned. There were also rumors that he was killed by cannibals and eaten .

If you look up the reviews of Machlins book here on Amazon you will see a lot of discussion that the answer as to how Michael died was never found. And the book takes time to read. But this film  and DVD  are different and I really found it fascinating.

If the name of the director  Fraser Heston  sounds slightly familiar it is because he is the director son of actor Charleston Heston (you know, the guy who parted the Red Seas in The Ten Commandants:!). Heston was fascinated by Machlins book and through  sheer luck  found that Machlin had taken hours of film  both silent and with sound and made audio tapes as well  when he made his seven month trip to visit the islands where the natives still go naked (full-frontal nudity alert!) and collect human skulls. The film was in short pieces and Heston and his Editor did a yeomans job of putting the films in some semblance of order. Heston has actors read documents from folks who were not recorded on tape, but a lot of it is actual voices. Its fascinating stuff.

I usually recommend that people watch any special features on a DVD AFTER they have seen a film,. In the case of this release, I urge you to what the special Feature oddly titled Press Kit. Its a 25 minute featurette on how the film came to be and it will actually add to the enjoyment while not providing any spoilers.

The 89 minutes goes fast. And it is Fraser Heston who does the core narration.

Anyone interested in Anthropology will definitely love this film But I recommend it any armchair travelers too. The footage of the various tribes of natives is truly remarkable.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8735112,5,B015YGKLYY,"A very compelling story about a man who chose to risk everything exploring new adventures rather than relying on his famous family's name and fortunes. The viewer is drawn back into a primitive  world of more than half a century ago, using actual film footage as well as voice-over recreations. This film is a must-see for anyone who loves unsolved mysteries. Although a very creditable case is made for what actually happened to the young Michael Rockefeller, be sure to view the additional features to discover an equally plausible second ending to this intriguing disappearance in the jungles of Dutch New Guinea.",1448928000,,616,5.03921568627451
