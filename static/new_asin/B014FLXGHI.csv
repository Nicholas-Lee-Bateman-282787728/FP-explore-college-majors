7390950,5,B014FLXGHI,"A few years ago, I discovered (and raved about) a documentary on female jazz musicians titled The Girls in the Band by director Judy Chaikin that was playing film festivals. The great news is that its now released on DVD as a deluxe edition with lots of great bonuses (including a full length commentary by Chaikin.) The 88-minute film , not only includes some great archival footage of all girl bands from the 30s and 40s like Ina Ray Hutton and Her Mellodears, and The International Sweethearts of Rhythm  but Chaikin was able to get new interviews by the few members of these bands who were still living (and are, sadly, now gone). She also covers such legendary jazz soloists and composer like Mary Lou Williams and Marian McPartland. Jazz band leader (and saxophonist) Peggy Gilbert lived to be 102 years old and Chaikin was able to interview her at age 101 (in 2006) when her mind was still very active and her memory clear. The film goes up to today with the 13 member Diva Jazz Orchestra, which tours on a bus 300 days each year. At the end Chaikin decided to gather all the living musicians in front the brownstone in upper Manhattan to recreate the classic photo A Great Day in Harlem with the women. One of the four bonus featurettes on the DVD is devoted to the creation of this photo. The others are devoted to the story of Williams, the Divas on tour and even the problems of a transgender musician (who was ""a woman living in a man's body"" - his/her words -  early in his/her career).

Sadly there was not a lot of time for full performances but some of the well-known folks like Hutton and The Sweethearts can be found on You Tube. But this documentary will put all those clips in perspective.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The history parallels that of the feminist movement in the 20th Century; women trying to make their way while lots of men tried to keep them down.
