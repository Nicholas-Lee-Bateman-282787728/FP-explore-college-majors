8069063,4,B0009X76XM,"We bought the Miss Mallard DVDs as huge fans of the book series.  The show is good fun, and they generally stick to the plots of the books, with the exception of adding the annoying character of Miss Mallard's nephew.  Why they felt they needed him I do not understand!  I love the slightly campy tone of the books and the ""international"" flavor--they are kind of like James Bond for primary school kids.  The TV show is not as funny and falls slightly flat, but our daughter enjoys them and they are good, wholesome fun if you have worn out your Scooby Doos as we did. The theme song and opening credits are pretty awesome too. If you get a chance read the books, though.  They are the perfect mysteries for kids who are transitioning to chapter books.",1364947200,,753,4.427536231884058
